AB  - Among the neoplasias, colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer
      death in men and women. The increasing incidence of this type of cancer is due to
      the increase in the population's life expectancy, by the increase in chronic
      inflammatory bowel diseases, primarily ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease,
      and the change in eating habits. The American Cancer Society (2011) shows that
      diet might be responsible for approximately 30% of cancer cases in developed
      countries, moreover when considering only colorectal cancer, the number can reach
      30% to 50%. Probiotics are effective in the prevention and treatment of many
      bowel diseases as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), diarrhea, irritable bowel
      syndrome, gluten intolerance, gastroenteritis, Helicobacter pyloriinfection, and 
      colon cancer. Classical examples are strains from the Lactobacillus, and
      Bifidobacteriumgenus that have probiotic proprieties with a potential use in the 
      prophylaxis, as well as in the treatment of a variety of gastrointestinal tract
      disorders. Researchers are focusing on extremely important studies regarding the 
      possibility of using probiotics to promote a balanced microbiota composition, and
      a sufficient immunological surveillance system as a way to prevent cancer.
      Considering the fact that the human intestines host 100 trillion bacteria,
      including more than 1,000 species, there is still need to perform more in depth
      investigations in order to find probiotics with potential to prevent, and treat
      cancerous diseases, adding a very promising effect to this already successful
      panorama. This revision aims to conduct a review of the most recent studies
      correlating probiotics and its cancer preventing and treatment potential.

TI  - Efficacy of thioguanine treatment in inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic
      review.
PG  - 9012-9021
AB  - AIM: To critically assess the available literature regarding the efficacy of
      thioguanine treatment in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, irrespective 
      of the (hepato-) toxicity profile. METHODS: A systematic literature search of the
      MEDLINE database using PubMed was performed using the keywords "thioguanine",
      "6-TG", "thioguanine", "inflammatory bowel disease", "IBD", "Crohn's disease",
      "Ulcerative colitis" and "effectiveness" in order to identify relevant articles
      published in English starting from 2000. Reference lists of the included articles
      were cross-checked for missing articles. Reviewed manuscripts concerning the
      effectiveness of thioguanine treatment in IBD were reviewed by the authors and
      the data were extracted. Data were subsequently analyzed with descriptive
      statistics. Due to the lack of standardized outcomes, a formal meta-analysis was 
      not performed. RESULTS: A total of 11 applicable studies were found that involved
      the effectiveness of thioguanine therapy in IBD. Eight studies were conducted in 
      a prospective manner, in the remaining three studies, data was collected
      retrospectively. In total, 353 IBD-patients (225 patients with Crohn's disease,
      119 with ulcerative colitis and nine with unclassified IBD) with prior
      azathioprine/mercaptopurine resistance and/or intolerance (n = 321) or de novo
      thioguanine administration (n = 32) were included for analysis, of which 228
      (65%) had clinical improvement on thioguanine therapy, based on standard IBD
      questionnaires, biochemical parameters or global physician assessments.
      Short-term results were based on 268 treatment years (median follow-up 9 mo,
      range 3-22 mo) with a median daily dose of 20 mg (range 10-80 mg).
      Discontinuation, mostly due to adverse events, was reported in 72 patients (20%).
      CONCLUSION: The efficacy of thioguanine therapy in IBD patients intolerant to
      conventional thiopurine therapy is observed in 65%, with short term adverse
      events in 20% of patients.

TI  - Surgical Management of Functional Constipation: Preliminary Report of a New
      Approach Using a Laparoscopic Sigmoid Resection Combined with a Malone
      Appendicostomy.
PG  - 336-340
LID - 10.1055/s-0036-1593606 [doi]
AB  - Introduction Functional constipation is a common problem in children. It usually 
      can be managed with laxatives but a small subset of patients develop intolerable 
      cramps and need to be temporarily treated with enemas. The senior author has
      previously reported: 1) open sigmoid resection as a surgical option, but this did
      not sufficiently reduce the laxative need, then 2) a transanal approach (with
      resection of rectosigmoid), but this led to a high rate of soiling due to
      extensive stretching of the anal canal and loss of the rectal reservoir. The
      understanding of these procedures' results has led us to use a laparoscopic
      sigmoid +/- left colonic resection with a Malone appendicostomy for these
      patients, to decrease the laxative requirements, temporarily treat with antegrade
      flushes, and to reduce postoperative soiling. Methods A single-institution
      retrospective review (3/2014-9/2015) included patients who failed our laxative
      protocol, and therefore were considered surgical candidates. Patients with
      anorectal malformation (ARM), Hirschsprung disease, spina bifida, tethered cord, 
      trisomy 21, cerebral palsy, mitochondrial disease, prior colon resection at other
      facilities, or those that did not participate in our laxative program were
      excluded. Demographics, duration of symptoms, prior treatments, postoperative
      complications, and postoperative bowel regimens were evaluated. Results A total
      of 6 patients (3 males; median age of 12.5 years) presented with soiling related 
      to constipation and intolerance to laxatives. Four patients failed preoperative
      cecostomy (done prior to referral to us). An average of 4.7 medication treatments
      were previously tried. In all, 4 patients had required in-patient disimpactions. 
      Duration of symptoms was 7.5 years (median). The median senna dose was 30 mg
      (range, 15-150 mg), and all patients had intolerable symptoms or failed to empty 
      their colon, which we considered a failed laxative trial. All had contrast enemas
      that demonstrated a dilated and/or redundant sigmoid colon, and colonic manometry
      was abnormal in 4. All patients underwent laparoscopic sigmoid and left colon
      resection, or only sigmoid resection (a low anterior resection). Two patients had
      postoperative colitis treated with oral antibiotics. The median follow-up was 52 
      days (range, 8-304 days). Five patients are on antegrade enemas with plans to
      convert to laxatives at 6 months, 1 is taking laxatives alone at a 33% lower
      dosage. Five of six are completely clean, 1 soils occasionally and their daily
      flush is being adjusted. Conclusion Only a minority of patients with functional
      constipation are medically unmanageable. This preliminary report shows that
      laparoscopic colon resection combined with antegrade flushes is an effective
      surgical technique to treat that group. A laparoscopic approach, guided by
      contrast enema and colonic manometry, allows for a defined resection of the
      abnormal segment of colon with the advantages of minimally invasive surgery
      including allowing for an extensive rectal resection (an improvement over open
      sigmoid resection) and avoidance of overstretching of the anal canal and removal 
      of the rectal reservoir (an improvement over the transanal approach). Having
      antegrade access is useful to manage soiling and avoiding cramping from laxatives
      in the early postoperative period. Although our series is small, we believe that 
      long-term most patients can avoid antegrade flushes and be on no, or a
      dramatically reduced, laxative dose.

TI  - Effectiveness of adalimumab for the treatment of ulcerative colitis in clinical
      practice: comparison between anti-tumour necrosis factor-naive and non-naive
      patients.
PG  - 788-799
LID - 10.1007/s00535-016-1274-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) treatment is focused to achieve mucosal
      healing, avoiding disease progression. The study aimed to evaluate the real-world
      effectiveness of adalimumab (ADA) in UC and to identify predictors of remission
      to ADA. METHODS: This cohort study used data from the ENEIDA registry. Clinical
      response, clinical remission, endoscopic remission, adverse events (AE),
      colectomy, and hospitalisations were evaluated; baseline characteristics and
      biological parameters were compared to determine predictors of response. RESULTS:
      We included 263 patients (87 naive and 176 previously exposed to anti-tumour
      necrosis factor alpha, TNF). After 12 weeks, clinical response, clinical
      remission, and endoscopic remission rates were 51, 26, and 14 %, respectively.
      The naive group demonstrated better response to treatment than the
      anti-TNF-exposed group at short-term. Clinical and endoscopic remission within 1 
      year of treatment was better in the naive group (65 vs. 49 and 50 vs. 35 %,
      respectively). The rates of AE, dose-escalation, hospitalisations, and colectomy 
      during the first year were higher in anti-TNF-exposed patients (40, 43, and 27 % 
      vs. 26, 21, and 11 %, respectively). Patients with primary failure and
      intolerance to the first anti-TNF and severe disease were associated with worse
      clinical response. Primary non-response to prior anti-TNF treatment and severe
      disease were predictive of poorer clinical remission. Low levels of C-reactive
      protein (CRP) and faecal calprotectin (FC) at baseline were predictors of
      clinical remission. CONCLUSIONS: In clinical practice, ADA was effective in UC,
      especially in anti-TNF naive patients. FC and CRP could be predictors of
      treatment effectiveness.

TI  - Efficacy of Vedolizumab Induction and Maintenance Therapy in Patients With
      Ulcerative Colitis, Regardless of Prior Exposure to Tumor Necrosis Factor

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The efficacy and safety of vedolizumab, a humanized
      immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody against the integrin alpha4beta7, were
      demonstrated in multicenter, phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trials in
      patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's
      disease. We analyzed data from 1 of these trials to determine the effects of
      vedolizumab therapy in patients with UC, based on past exposure to anti-tumor
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) antagonists. METHODS: We performed a post hoc
      analysis of data from the GEMINI 1 study, collected from 464 patients who
      received vedolizumab or placebo but had not received a previous TNF antagonist
      (naive to TNF antagonists) and 367 patients with an inadequate response, loss of 
      response, or intolerance to TNF antagonists (failure of TNF antagonists).
      Predefined outcomes of GEMINI 1 were evaluated in these subpopulations. RESULTS: 
      At Week 6, there were greater absolute differences in efficacy between
      vedolizumab and placebo in patients naive to TNF antagonists than patients with
      failure of TNF antagonists, although the risk ratios (RRs) for efficacy were
      similar for each group. Week 6 rates of response to vedolizumab and placebo were 
      53.1% and 26.3%, respectively, among patients naive to TNF antagonists (absolute 
      difference, 26.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 12.4-40.4; RR, 2.0; 95% CI,
      1.3-3.0); these rates were 39.0% and 20.6%, respectively, in patients with
      failure of TNF antagonists (absolute difference, 18.1%; 95% CI, 2.8-33.5; RR,
      1.9; 95% CI, 1.1-3.2). During maintenance therapy, the absolute differences were 
      similar but the RR for efficacy was higher for patients with failure of TNF
      antagonists than for patients naive to TNF antagonists, for most outcomes. Week
      52 rates of remission with vedolizumab and placebo were 46.9% and 19.0%,
      respectively, in patients naive to TNF antagonists (absolute difference, 28.0%;
      95% CI, 14.9-41.1; RR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.5-4.0) and 36.1% and 5.3%, respectively, in
      patients with failure of TNF antagonists (absolute difference, 29.5%; 95% CI,
      12.8-46.1; RR, 6.6; 95% CI, 1.7-26.5). No differences in adverse events were
      observed among groups. CONCLUSIONS: Vedolizumab demonstrated significantly
      greater efficacy as induction and maintenance therapy for UC than placebo in
      patients naive to TNF antagonists and patients with TNF antagonist failure. There
      were numerically greater treatment differences at Week 6 among patients receiving
      vedolizumab who were naive to TNF antagonists than patients with TNF antagonist
      failure. ClinicalTrials.gov no: NCT00783718.

AB  - AIM: to retrospectively evaluate the efficiency of long-term infliximab (INF)
      therapy in patients with refractory ulcerative colitis (UC). SUBJECTS AND
      METHODS: The investigation enrolled 48 patients with refractory UC who had taken 
      IFL in 2008 to 2014. Steroid-dependent or steroid-refractory UC was established
      in 40 (83.3%) patients; 8 (16.7%) were noted to be refractory to therapy with
      azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine. Cytomegalovirus DNA was identified in the
      biopsy specimens of the large intestinal mucosa (LIM) from 7 patients. One
      patient received antiviral therapy. Induction therapy with IFL was in its
      administration in a dose of 5 mg/kg at 0, 2, and 6 weeks, then maintenance
      therapy was continued every 8 weeks. RESULTS: After an IFL induction cycle, 3
      (6.3%) patients were unresponsive to therapy and were excluded from the
      investigation. At present, 25 (55.5%) of the 45 patients who have responded to
      the therapy continue to take IFL 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks and are in clinical
      remission; 4 (8.8%) patients receive intensified IFL therapy. Initially 23
      patients received combined therapy with IFL + an immunosuppressive drug; 22 had
      IFL monotherapy. Escape from the effect of the performed therapy was observed in 
      5 (11.1%) patients, which required its intensification. The intensified therapy
      resulted in sustained remission in 4 (8.8%) patients; colectomy was carried out
      in one (2.2%) case. Secondary loss of response to IFL, its intolerance,
      development of severe infectious complications, which did not allow for further
      maintenance therapy with IFL, were seen in 11 (24.4%) patients; 5 (11.1%) stopped
      the therapy because they had been excluded from the additional drug subsidy list.
      Maintenance therapy with IFL proved successful during 64 months in 29 (64.4%) of 
      the 45 patients and during 64 months if its intensity, when the occasion
      required, was enhanced. CONCLUSION: The long-term use of IFL in UC confirmed its 
      high efficacy in achieving clinical response, in inducing a clinical remission
      and its capacity to heal LIM, and in sustaining remission.

TI  - Presumed Allergic Proctocolitis Resolves with Probiotic Monotherapy: A Report of 
      4 Cases.
PG  - 621-4
AB  - BACKGROUND The prevalence of allergic diseases has been dramatically rising in
      the United States and other developed nations over recent decades. Growing
      evidence suggests a partial role for the microbiome in the development of these
      allergic diseases. Food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis (AP) (also
      referred to as cow's milk protein intolerance or allergy) is among the earliest
      and most common food allergic diseases of infancy, yet its pathophysiology is not
      well understood. The currently accepted clinical practice is to restrict the diet
      until 12 months of age. CASE REPORT We present 4 cases of clinically diagnosed AP
      whose symptoms quickly and completely resolved with probiotic Lactobacillus
      rhamnosus GG (LGG) monotherapy. All 4 infants avoided any dietary restrictions.
      The range of time from probiotic initiation to symptom resolution was 7-28 days. 
      CONCLUSIONS These cases suggest an important role for the infant intestinal
      microbiome in the development of gastrointestinal mucosal food allergies such as 
      AP. Prospective investigation of the intestinal microbiome in infants with AP may
      further our understanding of this disease's pathogenesis. The potential use of
      probiotic monotherapy in the treatment of AP also warrants further investigation.

TI  - [The use of methotrexate in an inflammatory bowel diseases based on the review of
      the current literature].
PG  - 262-6
AB  - M ethotrexate (MTX) as an immunomodulatory drug has numerous applications in
      autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune patomechanism is one of the factors responsible
      for development of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). MTX is an alternative
      therapy in the treatment of IBD. Over the past several years clinical trials has 
      confirmed the efficacy of MTX in the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD). Data
      concerning use of MTX in ulcerative colitis (UC) are not as numerous as in the
      CD. Currently, MTX is recommended for the induction treatment and maintenance
      therapy in CD patients, especially in steroid-dependent patients, disease
      refractory to corticosteroids, no improvement after treatment with azathioprine
      and 6-mercaptopurine, or in case of intolerance to these drugs. Preferred route
      of administration in the treatment of CD is parenteral supply. Contraception is
      indicated during MTX treatment since it's teratogenic.

TI  - Anti-food and anti-microbial IgG subclass antibodies in inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 1453-1461
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly Crohn's disease (CD), 
      is associated with increased microbial-specific IgG and IgA antibodies, whereas
      alterations of anti-food antibodies are still disputed. The knowledge about IgG
      subclass antibodies in IBD is limited. In this study we analysed IgG subclass
      antibodies specific for nutritional and commensal antigens in IBD patients and
      controls. METHODS: Serum IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 specific for wheat and milk
      extracts, purified ovalbumin, Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis lysates
      and mannan from Saccharomyces cerevisiae were analysed by ELISA in patients with 
      CD (n = 56), ulcerative colitis (UC; n = 29), acute gastroenteritis/colitis (n = 
      12) as well as non-inflammatory controls (n = 62). RESULTS: Anti-Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) of all IgG subclasses and anti-B. fragilis IgG1
      levels were increased in CD patients compared to UC patients and controls. The
      discriminant validity of ASCA IgG2 and IgG4 was comparable with that of ASCA
      pan-IgG and IgA, whereas it was inferior for ASCA IgG1/IgG3 and anti-B. fragilis 
      IgG1. Complicated CD defined by the presence of perianal, stricturing or
      penetrating disease phenotypes was associated with increased ASCA IgG1/IgG3/IgG4,
      anti-B. fragilis IgG1 and anti-E. coli IgG1 levels. Anti-food IgG subclass levels
      were not different between IBD patients and controls and did not correlate with
      food intolerance. In contrast to anti-microbial Abs, food-specific IgG responses 
      were predominately of the IgG4 isotype and all food-specific IgG subclass levels 
      correlated negatively with age. CONCLUSION: Our study supports the notion that
      the adaptive immune recognition of food and commensal antigens are differentially
      regulated.

TI  - Food intolerance prevalence in active ulcerative colitis in southwest China.
PG  - 529-33
LID - 10.6133/apjcn.102015.04 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Food intolerance is believed to be a source of
      frequent medical problems in ulcerative colitis (UC), which closely correlate
      with patients' dietary pattern. Living in an underdeveloped area of China,
      residents in southwestern region have diverse dietary habits. The objective of
      this study is to determine the prevalence of food intolerance in the UC patients 
      in this area and to discuss some of the possible risk factors leading to the
      condition. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Food antibodies in serum of 80 patients with
      active UC were determined by standard enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA).
      This study examined the risk factors contributing to high titers of food
      antibodies and the dietary patterns correlating with food intolerance in these
      demographics. RESULTS: 83.8% of patients (67/80) were found to be seropositive
      for food intolerance. Patients of female, aged between 20 to 40 and the one who
      tended to have a high fat diet were tested to be highly seropositive (p<0.05).
      Neither spicy food intake nor the course the disease manifested any relationship 
      with the presence of food intolerance (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Active UC patients in
      southwestern region of China have showed to be high seropositive in food
      intolerance, particularly in female and young patients. Dietary patterns with
      high in fat intake seem to have caused high prevalence of seropositivity in food 
      intolerance. Although rice has been taken as staple food and the spicy food has
      been popular among citizen in this region, these foods have indicated to no
      effect on food intolerance in this study.

AB  - Integrins play a crucial role in the development and maintenance of the
      inflammatory process in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Vedolizumab is 
      a humanized monoclonal antibody with a predominantly gastrointestinal effect. It 
      specifically inhibits leukocyte integrin alpha4beta7, thus preventing its
      interaction with mucosal vascular addressin cell adhesion molecule 1(MAdCAM-1),
      which is involved in the migration of lymphocytes from the blood stream to the
      intestinal tissue. Vedolizumab is indicated in the treatment of moderate to
      severe active Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in adult patients with poor 
      response, loss of response, or intolerance to conventional treatment or to tumour
      necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) antagonists. This review presents the most
      relevant clinical outcomes of vedolizumab in the treatment of patients with
      ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Safety and Efficacy of Granulocyte/Monocyte Apheresis in Steroid-Dependent Active
      Ulcerative Colitis with Insufficient Response or Intolerance to
      Immunosuppressants and/or Biologics [the ART Trial]: 12-week Interim Results.
PG  - 812-20
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjw032 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Patients with active, steroid-dependent ulcerative colitis
      with insufficient response or intolerance to immunosuppressants and/or biologic
      therapies have limited treatment options. Adacolumn, a granulocyte/monocyte
      adsorptive apheresis device, has shown clinical benefit in these patients. This
      study aimed to provide additional clinical data regarding the safety and efficacy
      of Adacolumn in this patient subgroup. METHODS: This single-arm, open-label,
      multicentre trial [ART] was conducted at 18 centres across the UK, France, and
      Germany. Eligible patients were 18-75 years old with moderate-to-severe,
      steroid-dependent active ulcerative colitis with insufficient response or
      intolerance to immunosuppressants and/or biologics. Patients received >/= 5
      weekly apheresis sessions with Adacolumn. The primary endpoint was clinical
      remission rate [clinical activity index </= 4] at Week 12. RESULTS: In all, 86
      patients were enrolled. At Week 12, 33/84 [39.3%] of patients in the
      intention-to-treat population achieved clinical remission, with 47/84 [56.0%]
      achieving a clinical response [clinical activity index reduction of >/= 3].
      Clinical remission was achieved in 30.0% of patients with previous
      immunosuppressant and biologic failure; steroid-free clinical remission and
      response were observed in 22.6% and 35.7% of these patients, respectively.
      Quality of life [Short Health Scale] significantly improved at Week 12 [p <
      0.0001]. The majority of adverse events were of mild/moderate intensity.
      CONCLUSIONS: At Week 12, Adacolumn provided significant clinical benefit in a
      large cohort of steroid-dependent ulcerative colitis patients with previous
      failure to immunosuppressant and/or biologic treatment, with a favourable safety 
      profile. These results are consistent with previous studies and support Adacolumn
      use in this difficult-to-treat patient subgroup.

TI  - Role of antibiotics for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1078-87
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i3.1078 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease is thought to be caused by an aberrant immune response
      to gut bacteria in a genetically susceptible host. The gut microbiota plays an
      important role in the pathogenesis and complications of the two main inflammatory
      bowel diseases: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis. Alterations in gut
      microbiota, and specifically reduced intestinal microbial diversity, have been
      found to be associated with chronic gut inflammation in these disorders. Specific
      bacterial pathogens, such as virulent Escherichia coli strains, Bacteroides spp, 
      and Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis, have been linked to the
      pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. Antibiotics may influence the course 
      of these diseases by decreasing concentrations of bacteria in the gut lumen and
      altering the composition of intestinal microbiota. Different antibiotics,
      including ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, the combination of both, rifaximin, and
      anti-tuberculous regimens have been evaluated in clinical trials for the
      treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. For the treatment of active luminal CD, 
      antibiotics may have a modest effect in decreasing disease activity and achieving
      remission, and are more effective in patients with disease involving the colon.
      Rifamixin, a non absorbable rifamycin has shown promising results. Treatment of
      suppurative complications of CD such as abscesses and fistulas, includes drainage
      and antibiotic therapy, most often ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, or a combination
      of both. Antibiotics might also play a role in maintenance of remission and
      prevention of post operative recurrence of CD. Data is more sparse for ulcerative
      colitis, and mostly consists of small trials evaluating ciprofloxacin,
      metronidazole and rifaximin. Most trials did not show a benefit for the treatment
      of active ulcerative colitis with antibiotics, though 2 meta-analyses concluded
      that antibiotic therapy is associated with a modest improvement in clinical
      symptoms. Antibiotics show a clinical benefit when used for the treatment of
      pouchitis. The downsides of antibiotic treatment, especially with recurrent or
      prolonged courses such as used in inflammatory bowel disease, are significant
      side effects that often cause intolerance to treatment, Clostridium dificile
      infection, and increasing antibiotic resistance. More studies are needed to
      define the exact role of antibiotics in inflammatory bowel diseases.

TI  - 6-Mercaptopurine for Azathioprine Intolerant Inflammatory Bowel Disease:
      Literature Search and Reappraisal of Own Data.
PG  - 133-7
AB  - Thiopurines have been shown to effectively maintain remission of both Crohn's
      disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), and to behave as disease modifiers if
      used for >12 months in UC. Gastric intolerance manifesting as nausea constitutes 
      a demanding drawback of thiopurines, at times forcing treatment discontinuance. A
      few studies have now indicated that some patients might tolerate mercaptopurine
      (6-MP) for azathioprine. In this paper, we review the literature, and reappraise 
      our own data against the published figures. The data which form the basis for
      this study span over all visit reports that were released between January 2008
      and December 2011 in a primary care Hospital, in Turin, Italy. For the aim of
      this study we searched our own database and the MedLine using the key-words
      "azathioprine", "mercaptopurine", "thiopurine", "inflammatory bowel disease",
      "Crohn's disease", "ulcerative colitis". We retrieved 85 azathioprine
      prescriptions for 42 UC, 37 CD, and 6 miscellaneous patients. There were 10
      episodes of gastric intolerance to azathioprine, which were switched to 6-MP: 6
      out of 10 (60%) responded and tolerated the switch drug in a median follow-up of 
      66 months. Female gender prevailed (p=0.038) in the azathioprine intolerant
      subset. A trial with 6-MP is worth being offered to azathioprine intolerant
      inflammatory bowel disease subjects at any center matching the standard figures
      of specific performance.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic autoimmune disease,
      whose main forms are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The main treatment
      of IBD includes oral administration of anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive
      agents enclosed in traditional dosage forms, intended to release the active
      ingredient in the large intestine. However, most of them have been designed based
      on the physiology of healthy colon, which differs distinctly from conditions met 
      in IBD patients risking adverse effects and patient intolerance. The use of
      nanoparticles as a drug carrier for treatment of IBD is a promising approach that
      is capable of solving this problem. Previous studies have shown a size-dependent 
      behavior, where reducing the particle size, increases the targeting efficacy and 
      the residence time compared to healthy controls. AREAS COVERED: This review
      covers the utilization of nanoparticles as drug delivery carriers for treating
      IBD. They can reach the inflamed colonic sites either by endothelial or
      epithelial delivery employing passive and active targeting strategies. The effect
      of particle size is analyzed in detail while elucidating other essential
      parameters such as the particle surface properties. EXPERT OPINION: One of the
      most important advantages of nanoparticles is their passive targeting to the
      inflamed colonic tissues due to their size. Recent findings underline that this
      size-dependent bioadhesion behavior can be further enhanced by selecting smart
      surface properties to help in penetrating the mucus and reach the inflamed sites.

PG  - 293-5
LID - 10.1159/000442946 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present the mesalamine-induced acute exacerbation of symptoms and
      inflammatory markers in children with Crohn's disease (CD). CLINICAL PRESENTATION
      AND INTERVENTION: Three children who presented with CD had acute exacerbation of 
      colitis symptoms or elevated inflammatory markers when mesalamine was added to
      treatment while tapering/ceasing steroid treatment. While on steroid treatment,
      the patients maintained clinical and laboratory remission, but with the
      initiation of mesalamine treatment, they had abdominal pain and bloody mucoid
      diarrhoea and/or elevation of white blood cell count, C-reactive protein level
      and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Bacterial pathogens were excluded from the
      urine, throat and blood cultures, parasites with stool examination, viral
      pathogens with serology. Within 3-7 days after the mesalamine treatment had been 
      stopped, the patients showed improvement of colitis symptoms and normalisation of
      white blood cell count, C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation
      rate. CONCLUSION: In this study mesalamine mimicked CD relapse in children with
      CD while tapering or after stopping steroid treatment. Awareness of this side
      effect of mesalamine could prevent a misdiagnosis of steroid dependency.

TI  - Vedolizumab for the Treatment of Adults with Moderate-to-Severe Active Ulcerative
      Colitis: An Evidence Review Group Perspective of a NICE Single Technology
      Appraisal.
PG  - 245-57
LID - 10.1007/s40273-015-0334-3 [doi]
AB  - As part of its single technology appraisal (STA) process, the National Institute 
      for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the manufacturer of vedolizumab
      (Takeda UK) to submit evidence of the clinical effectiveness and cost
      effectiveness of vedolizumab for the treatment of patients with
      moderate-to-severe active ulcerative colitis (UC). The Evidence Review Group
      (ERG) produced a critical review of the evidence for the clinical effectiveness
      and cost effectiveness of the technology, based upon the company's submission to 
      NICE. The evidence was derived mainly from GEMINI 1, a Phase 3, multicentre,
      randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of the induction and
      maintenance of clinical response and remission by vedolizumab (MLN0002) in
      patients with moderate-to-severe active UC with an inadequate response to, loss
      of response to or intolerance of conventional therapy or anti-tumour necrosis
      factor (TNF)-alpha. The clinical evidence showed that vedolizumab performed
      significantly better than placebo in both the induction and maintenance phases.
      In the post hoc subgroup analyses in patients with or without prior
      anti-TNF-alpha therapy, vedolizumab performed better then placebo (p value not
      reported). In addition, a greater improvement in health-related quality of life
      was observed in patients treated with vedolizumab, and the frequency and types of
      adverse events were similar in the vedolizumab and placebo groups, but the
      evidence was limited to short-term follow-up. There were a number of limitations 
      and uncertainties in the clinical evidence base, which warrants caution in its
      interpretation--in particular, the post hoc subgroup analyses and high dropout
      rates in the maintenance phase of GEMINI 1. The company also presented a network 
      meta-analysis of vedolizumab versus other biologic therapies indicated for
      moderate-to-severe UC. However, the ERG considered that the results presented may
      have underestimated the uncertainty in treatment effects, since fixed-effects
      models were used, despite clear evidence of heterogeneity among the trials
      included in the network. Results from the company's economic evaluation (which
      included price reductions to reflect the proposed patient access scheme for
      vedolizumab) suggested that vedolizumab is the most effective option compared
      with surgery and conventional therapy in the following three populations: (1) a
      mixed intention-to-treat population, including patients who have previously
      received anti-TNF-alpha therapy and those who are anti-TNF-alpha naive; (2)
      patients who are anti-TNF-alpha naive only; and (3) patients who have previously 
      failed anti-TNF-alpha therapy only. The ERG concluded that the results of the
      company's economic evaluation could not be considered robust, because of errors
      in model implementation, omission of relevant comparators, deviations from the
      NICE reference case and questionable model assumptions. The ERG amended the
      company's model and demonstrated that vedolizumab is expected to be dominated by 
      surgery in all three populations.

TI  - Safety and Efficacy of AJM300, an Oral Antagonist of alpha4 Integrin, in
      Induction Therapy for Patients With Active Ulcerative Colitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: AJM300 is an orally active small-molecule antagonist of the
      alpha4 integrin subunit. We performed a randomized trial to investigate the
      efficacy and safety of AJM300 in patients with active ulcerative colitis (UC).
      METHODS: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2a study, 102 patients with
      moderately active UC (Mayo Clinic scores of 6-10, endoscopic subscores >/=2, and 
      rectal bleeding subscores >/=1) who had inadequate response or intolerance to
      mesalamine or corticosteroids were randomly assigned to receive AJM300 (960 mg)
      or placebo 3 times daily for 8 weeks. The primary end point was a clinical
      response at week 8, defined as a decrease in Mayo Clinic score of at least 3
      points and a decrease of at least 30% from baseline, with a decrease in the
      rectal bleeding subscore of at least 1 point or an absolute rectal bleeding
      subscore of 0 or 1. RESULTS: Clinical response rates were 62.7% and 25.5% at week
      8 in the AJM300 group and placebo group, respectively (odds ratio [OR] = 5.35;
      95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.23-12.82; P = .0002). Rates of clinical remission
      (Mayo Clinic score </=2 and no subscore >1) were 23.5% and 3.9% in the AJM300
      group and placebo groups, respectively (OR = 7.81; 95% CI: 1.64-37.24; P =
      .0099), and rates of mucosal healing (endoscopic subscores of 0 or 1) were 58.8% 
      and 29.4% (OR = 4.65; 95% CI: 1.81-11.90; P = .0014). No serious adverse event,
      including progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, was observed, although more
      investigations are needed to confirm the safety profile of this drug.
      CONCLUSIONS: AJM300 was well tolerated and more effective than placebo in
      inducing clinical response, clinical remission, and mucosal healing in patients
      with moderately active UC. ClinicalTrials.jp no: JapicCTI-132293.

TI  - Chronic inflammation up-regulates P-gp in peripheral mononuclear blood cells via

PG  - 13558

AB  - Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, including Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis, often suffer drug intolerance. This resistance can be divided
      into intrinsic resistance and acquired resistance. Although there is agreement on
      acquired resistance, studies regarding intrinsic resistance have demonstrated
      inconsistencies, especially for Crohn's disease. For this reason, an animal model
      of Crohn's disease was induced with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid solution 
      (TNBS), and intrinsic resistance was analyzed by measuring the function and
      expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PMBC),
      followed by mechanistic studies. The results revealed reduced retention of
      cyclosporine A in PMBC over-expressing P-gp in a TNBS-treated group and enhanced 
      secretion of the cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-17, and TNF-alpha as well as LPS in
      plasma. These cytokines and LPS can induce P-gp expression through the
      STAT3/Nf-kappab pathway, contributing to a decrease of cyclosporine A retention, 
      which can be reversed by the application of a P-gp inhibitor. Our results
      demonstrated that the sustained chronic inflammation could induce the intrinsic
      resistance presented as P-gp over-expression in PBMC in Crohn's disease through
      STAT3/Nf-kappab pathway and this resistance might be reversed by combinational
      usage of P-gp inhibitors.

TI  - Food Intolerance: Immune Activation Through Diet-associated Stimuli in Chronic
      Disease.
PG  - 42-52
AB  - The immune response is a very complex interplay of specific and nonspecific
      branches that have evolved to distinguish between nondangerous and dangerous or
      nontolerated factors. In the past, research has focused on the specific immune
      system much more than the host's innate defense. Studies have shown that a key
      component of the immune response involves activation of the inflammasome. A
      direct relationship between the presence of the inflammasome and the onset of
      disease has already been characterized for a variety of chronic and food-related 
      diseases, including arthrosclerosis, metabolic syndrome, and chronic bowel
      diseases, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The leukocyte
      activation (ALCAT test), an immunological blood test for food intolerance
      reactions, is ideal to identify and eliminate individual food stimuli that may
      act as triggers for the cellular nonspecific immune response. Although the test
      is not diagnostic, studies have established that it can be a useful screening
      tool for the identification of foreign substances that may trigger immune cell
      activation, particularly of neutrophils, leading to inflammatory disorders. The
      ALCAT test, coupled with a targeted diet that is individually tailored according 
      to the test's results, may support immune homeostasis and provide a valuable
      complementary approach for therapy and overall health.

TI  - Metagenomic analysis of microbiome in colon tissue from subjects with
      inflammatory bowel diseases reveals interplay of viruses and bacteria.
PG  - 1419-27
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000344 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are
      poorly understood disorders affecting the intestinal tract. The current model for
      disease suggests that genetically susceptible patients develop intolerance to gut
      microflora, and chronic inflammation develops as a result of environmental
      insults. Although interest has mainly focused on studying genetic variants and
      gut bacterial flora, little is known about the potential of viral infection to
      contribute to disease. Accordingly, we conducted a metagenomic analysis to
      document the baseline virome in colonic biopsy samples from patients with IBD in 
      order to assess the contribution of viral infection to IBD. Libraries were
      generated from colon RNA to create approximately 2 GB sequence data per library. 
      Using a bioinformatic pipeline designed to detect viral sequences, more than 1000
      viral reads were derived directly from tissue without any coculture or isolation 
      procedure. Herein, we describe the complexity and abundance of viruses,
      bacteria/bacteriophage, and human endogenous retroviral sequences from 10
      patients with IBD and 5 healthy subjects undergoing surveillance colonoscopy.
      Differences in gut microflora and the abundance of mammalian viruses and human
      endogenous retroviruses were readily detected in the metagenomic analyses.
      Specifically, patients with herpesviridae sequences in their colon demonstrated
      increased expression of human endogenous viral sequences and differences in the
      diversity of their microbiome. This study provides a promising metagenomic
      approach to describe the colonic microbiome that can be used to better understand
      virus-host and phage-bacteria interactions in IBD.

AB  - Educational programs have been used as a control condition in trials on
      psychological therapies for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). An optimal control
      condition should have all logistic features of the experimental intervention,
      except the active component, but also have basic therapeutic benefit for the
      patient. The aim of the present study is to systematically determine patients'
      educational needs on the basis of the (mis)conceptions that they have of their
      disease and their reported desire for information to optimize the control
      intervention in IBS research. A systematic review of studies on the knowledge and
      educational needs of IBS patients in terms of their condition was performed.
      Studies published as full text in the English language in peer-reviewed journals 
      and that included adult IBS patients diagnosed according to the Manning or Rome
      I, II, or III criteria were selected. Eight studies involving 2132 patients were 
      included. When focusing on misconceptions of patients, the most prevalent are
      that IBS is caused by dietary factors, food allergies and intolerance (37-90%),
      heredity (52%), or a lack of digestive enzymes (52%); IBS is a form of colitis
      (43%); and will last a lifetime (31-54%), develop into cancer (15-49%), or
      worsens with age (48%). Patients are 'unhappy' with their level of knowledge or
      feel poorly informed (65%). They want information about the diagnostic process,
      which foods to avoid (63%), causes (62%), coping strategies (59%), new
      medications (55%), course (52%), and the role of psychological factors (51%). IBS
      patients do have a large variety of educational needs. Educational programs
      optimally addressing these needs can be used adequately as a placebo control
      condition in research on psychological interventions.

TI  - TELEmedicine for Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (TELE-IBD): Design and 
      implementation of randomized clinical trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), comprised of ulcerative colitis
      and Crohn's disease, are chronic disorders characterized by worsening of symptoms
      followed by symptom-free periods. Symptoms have a profound negative impact on
      quality of life and are associated with increased health care utilization.
      Despite effective treatments, outcomes are suboptimal secondary to nonadherence, 
      medication intolerance, inconsistent monitoring, poor patient knowledge and
      limited access to care. OBJECTIVES: Compare disease activity and quality of life 
      over 1 year in a randomized trial of IBD patients receiving standard care versus 
      telemedicine. METHODS: Patients evaluated at 3 IBD referral centers with
      worsening symptoms within the last 2 years are eligible for randomization to one 
      of two interventions or standard care. The interventions consist of either every 
      other week or weekly assessment of symptoms, side effects, weight and delivery of
      medication prompts and education via texts to the participant's mobile phone.
      Individualized alerts and action plans are created on a secure portal.
      Participants in the standard care group undergo routine and urgent follow-up
      visits and telephone calls. The primary outcomes group comparisons of changes in 
      disease activity and quality of life scores from baseline to 6 and 12 months.
      CONCLUSIONS: Methods such as telemedicine are needed to improve monitoring,
      adherence, self-efficacy, and patient knowledge in IBD. If effective,
      telemedicine should decrease symptoms, improve quality of life, and decrease
      health care utilization. The burden associated with use of telemedicine for
      patients and providers needs to be assessed. The trial is ongoing and will be
      completed in July 2016.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Data suggest physicians poorly assess disease-specific literacy and
      transition readiness in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
      We piloted an electronic, interactive iPad quiz game that could be used in a
      clinical setting, with the aims of measuring IBD-related knowledge, and
      concomitant mood and quality of life (QOL) in a pediatric population. METHODS:
      Two pediatric IBD clinics developed and tested 2 versions of "Emma." Patients
      between 10 and 18 years of age played Emma during an office visit. Each patient
      answered 12 randomly selected disease-related questions and 4 mood-related
      questions. RESULTS: Sites 1 and 2 tested Emma v1 between May and August 2013.
      Emma v2 was tested from November 2013 to January 2014 and from September 2013 to 
      January 2014. A total of 56 patients played Emma v1, whereas 60 played Emma v2.
      In Emma v2, 73.1% of questions were answered correctly. Patients recognized signs
      of IBD (88%), causes of diarrhea in addition to IBD (79.4%), and could define
      lactose intolerance (95.8%), but fewer patients understood serological testing
      used for disease monitoring (68%) or knew that magnetic resonance enterography
      did not involve radiation (22.9%). Patients tended to report good functioning in 
      the areas of energy, mood, anxiety, and school-related QOL. Patients with Crohn
      disease, however, reported higher stress levels compared with patients with
      ulcerative colitis; older patients reported lower energy levels, and postsurgical
      patients reported lower QOL. CONCLUSIONS: The Emma iPad game has the potential to
      evaluate gaps in IBD knowledge, assess emotional functioning, and increase
      patient engagement as a transition tool in the clinical setting.

      current aspects.
PG  - 197167
LID - 10.1155/2015/197167 [doi]
AB  - Enteral nutrition (EN) is considered to be of great importance in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and nutritional problems. This comprehensive
      review is aiming to provide the reader with an update on the role of EN in IBD
      patients. EN can reduce Crohn's disease (CD) activity and maintain remission in
      both adults and children. Nutritional support using liquid formulas should be
      considered for CD patients and in serious cases of ulcerative colitis (UC),
      especially for those who may require prolonged cycles of corticosteroids. Given
      that the ultimate goal in the treatment of CD is mucosal healing, this advantage 
      of EN over corticosteroid treatment is valuable in therapeutic decision-making.
      EN is indicated in active CD, in cases of steroid intolerance, in patient's
      refusal of steroids, in combination with steroids in undernourished individuals, 
      and in patients with an inflammatory stenosis of the small intestine. No
      differences between the efficiency of elemental diets and nonelemental formulas
      have been noticed. EN must be the first choice compared to TPN. EN has a
      restricted value in the treatment of patients with large bowel CD. In conclusion,
      it seems important not to underestimate the role of nutrition as supportive care 
      in patients with IBD.

TI  - Methotrexate for maintaining remission in paediatric Crohn's patients with prior 
      failure or intolerance to thiopurines: a multicenter cohort study.
PG  - 305-11
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv031 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Methotrexate [MTX] is an immunomodulating drug that can be
      used to maintain remission in patients with Crohn's disease [CD], but data on
      efficacy and tolerability in children and teenagers are scarce. We evaluated the 
      long-term efficacy and tolerability of MTX monotherapy after thiopurine therapy
      in paediatric CD patients. METHODS: A multicenter cohort of paediatric MTX users 
      who stopped thiopurines due to ineffectiveness or intolerance between 2002 and
      2012 were included and followed for at least 12 months. Relapse-free use was
      defined as steroid and biologics-free clinical remission after the introduction
      of MTX, and included intentional discontinuation of successful therapy before the
      end of the observation period. RESULTS: A total of 113 patients with CD in
      remission were followed while on MTX monotherapy, of whom 75 [66%] had failed on 
      thiopurines and 38 [34%] had stopped thiopurines due to side effects. Median age 
      at the introduction of MTX was 14 years [range 7 to 17], and 93% used the
      subcutaneous route. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that 52% of the study cohort
      were still in steroid- and biologics-free remission after 12 months of MTX
      monotherapy, with a difference that did not reach significance between
      thiopurine-intolerant and thiopurine-failing patients [p = 0.21, log-rank test]. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this cohort study suggest that MTX is an effective
      immunomodulator to maintain remission after stopping thiopurines. MTX maintenance
      should be considered before stepping up to anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha
      therapy. MTX is probably somewhat more effective in patients who stopped
      thiopurines due to side effects than in those who failed on thiopurines.

TI  - Systematic review with meta-analysis: the efficacy of a second anti-TNF in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease whose previous anti-TNF treatment has
      failed.
PG  - 613-23
LID - 10.1111/apt.13083 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: One-third of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis
      (UC) receiving anti-TNFs do not respond to treatment, and a relevant proportion
      experience loss of response or intolerance. AIM: To investigate the efficacy and 
      safety of a second anti-TNF agent after primary/secondary failure or intolerance 
      to a first drug. METHODS: INCLUSION CRITERIA: studies evaluating the efficacy of 
      infliximab (IFX), adalimumab (ADA) and certolizumab-pegol (CZP) as the second
      anti-TNF in CD or UC. SEARCH STRATEGY: Bibliographical searches (PubMed/Embase). 
      DATA SYNTHESIS: percentage of response/remission; the meta-analysis was performed
      using the inverse variance method. RESULTS: We included 46 studies (37 CD, 8 UC, 
      1 pouchitis). The CD studies comprised 32 switching IFX-->ADA, 4 IFX-->CZP and 1 
      ADA-->IFX. Overall, the second anti-TNF after the failure of IFX in CD induced
      remission in 43% and response in 63% of patients. The remission rate was higher
      when the reason to withdraw the first anti-TNF was intolerance (61%) than after
      secondary (45%) or primary failure (30%); response rates were, respectively, 72%,
      62% and 53%. All UC studies switched IFX-->ADA, six of them reporting remission
      rates ranging from 0% to 50%. Adverse events rate ranged from 0% to 81% in CD,
      most of them mild (serious adverse event 0-21%, discontinuation rate <20%).
      CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of a second anti-TNF in CD patients largely depends on 
      the cause for switching. The remission rate is higher when the reason to withdraw
      the first anti-TNF is intolerance (61%), compared with secondary (45%) or primary
      failure (30%). Further studies of switch ADA-->IFX are needed to evaluate this
      strategy. PROSPERO-registry-number: CRD42014012943.

TI  - Use of a third anti-TNF after failure of two previous anti-TNFs in patients with 
      inflammatory bowel disease: is it worth it?
PG  - 379-86
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2014.928901 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Some patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) never respond or 
      lose their response to a second anti-TNF. AIM: To review the efficacy and safety 
      of a third anti-TNF after failure of two previous anti-TNFs. Methods.
      Bibliographical searches in PubMed for studies evaluating infliximab, adalimumab,
      or certolizumab as the third anti-TNF in IBD patients whose two previous anti-TNF
      treatments had failed. RESULTS: Two retrospective studies with a small sample
      size and limited follow up evaluated the effectiveness of a third anti-TNF
      patients whose two previous anti-TNFs had failed. The arguments for this
      switching strategy are as follows: a)favorable--albeit limited--efficacy (in the 
      study by Allez et al., clinical response was observed in 51% of patients at week 
      20; and in the study by de Silva et al., over 50% of patients remained on the
      third anti-TNF at 1 year); b)the eventual response to the third anti-TNF is
      relatively quick; c) no other medical options have been approved for IBD
      treatment; d)the only alternative options are surgery, compassionate use with
      non-anti-TNFs, and clinical trials. However, there are also arguments against the
      prescription of a third anti-TNF: a)lack of experience, since the few available
      studies are limited by their small sample size; b)the relatively low response in 
      the long term (mainly due to loss of response); c) and finally, and most
      importantly, the risk of severe adverse events. CONCLUSION: The delicate balance 
      between pros and cons means the use of a third anti-TNF after failure of two
      previous agents should be considered only in patients with no other therapeutic
      options. Decisions should be taken on an individual basis.

TI  - Ulcerative colitis patients with an inflammatory response upon mesalazine cannot 
      be desensitized: a randomized study.
PG  - 399-405
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2014.962608 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Mesalazine is a key drug in the treatment of ulcerative
      colitis (UC). Intolerance to mesalazine has been described, including fever and
      gastrointestinal symptoms. Several case reports reported successful
      desensitization of patients with mesalazine intolerance. The aim was to assess
      the number of UC patients who are persistently intolerant to mesalazine after
      single-blinded rechallenge and to test the effectiveness of a rapid
      desensitization protocol in UC patients demonstrated mesalazine intolerance.
      METHODS: This is a prospective, single-blind randomized study in UC patients who 
      discontinued mesalazine because of intolerance. Patients with severe reactions
      were excluded. Eligible patients underwent a skin patch test with mesalazine
      followed by a single-blinded randomized crossover rechallenge with 500 mg
      mesalazine or placebo. Patients with symptoms upon rechallenge were admitted to
      the hospital for 3 days oral desensitization. RESULTS: Nine of the 37 identified 
      UC patients who discontinued mesalazine because of intolerance were included. All
      nine patients had negative patch tests, seven patients had symptoms (fever,
      nausea, vomiting and diarrhea) within 2 h upon rechallenge. Four of these seven
      patients participated in the desensitization protocol and in none a successful
      desensitization could be performed. All four had an inflammatory intolerance
      reaction with rise in C-reactive protein. There were no elevations in serum
      tryptase or urinary-methylhistamine levels observed and no signs of immediate
      type allergic reactions, like urticaria, bronchial obstruction or anaphylaxis.
      CONCLUSION: We recommend not to rechallenge UC patients with an inflammatory
      response upon mesalazine and these patients will not benefit from a rapid
      desensitization protocol.

TI  - Ileo-ileal intussusception in a premature neonate: an unusual cause of NEC in
      premature babies.
PG  - 76-7
LID - 01.2015/JCPSP.7677 [doi]
AB  - Intussusception is a rare entity in neonates. It may present with non-specific
      signs including abdominal distension, feeding intolerance, vomiting and bloody
      stools. Symptomatology is similar to Necrotizing Entero-Colitis (NEC). Ultrasound
      can help to establish early diagnosis in neonate. A 27-week preterm newborn was
      initially suspected as NEC based on abdominal distention, bilious vomiting,
      worsening clinical condition and dilated loops of bowel on X-ray, which turned
      out to be ileo-ileal intussusception. Diagnosis was made by ultrasound obtained
      for a palpable mass to rule out intra abdominal abscess and lack of improvement
      in clinical condition despite 5 days of conservative treatment. Surgery was
      performed consisting of removal of the necrotic intussusception area and
      end-to-end anastomosis and patient was discharged from hospital on day 60 of
      life. As a conclusion, pathological abdominal findings in preterm newborns can
      also be due to conditions other than NEC and ultrasound may be a useful tool for 
      timely and accurate diagnosis.

AB  - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are two chronic inflammatory bowel
      conditions. Current approved biologic therapies are limited to blocking tumor
      necrosis factor alpha. Unfortunately, some patients are primary nonresponders,
      experiencing a loss of response, intolerance, or side effects. This defines an
      unmet need for novel therapeutic strategies. The rapid recruitment and
      inappropriate retention of leukocytes is a hallmark of chronic inflammation and a
      potentially promising therapeutic target. Here we discuss the clinical trial
      results of vedolizumab (anti-alpha4beta7, LDP-02, MLN-02, and MLN0002) and its
      impact on future management of inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Benefit of infliximab reintroduction after successive failure of infliximab and
      adalimumab in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 349-55
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jju024 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infliximab [IFX] and adalimumab [ADA] are effective in Crohn's
      disease [CD] for induction and maintenance therapy. However, high annual rate of 
      discontinuation for loss of response or intolerance may lead to a switch to
      another anti-tumor necrosis factor agent. Patients with successive failure to IFX
      and ADA are becoming more frequent. The aim of this study was to assess the
      efficacy and the tolerance of re-treatment with IFX in CD patients who
      successively failed IFX and ADA. METHODS: A total of 61 patients with CD who
      received and discontinued successively IFX and ADA, and who were re-exposed to
      IFX, were identified in four French tertiary centers and retrospectively
      analyzed. Clinical data, follow-up and outcome were abstracted from medical
      records. RESULTS: Median treatment duration after reintroduction was 16 months,
      and probability of remaining under IFX was 60% and 51%, respectively, at 12 and
      24 months. In all 29 patients discontinued the second IFX treatment due to
      intolerance [13], primary non-response [8], loss of response [7] or patient's
      wish [1]. Remission was achieved in 42% at week 6-8 after IFX re-induction, and
      was predictive of better long-term response [p = 0.006]. In multivariate
      analysis, receiving co-immunosuppression in both first and second IFX treatments 
      [p = 0.04] and shorter interval between first and second IFX treatments [p =
      0.017] were independently associated with longer duration of second IFX
      treatment. CONCLUSION: For CD patients who successively failed IFX and ADA,
      reintroducing IFX is feasible and often clinically efficient, particularly in
      patients who received co-immunosuppression during both first and second IFX
      treatments.

AB  - Characterized by colonic mucosa intraepithelial lymphocytosis, lymphocytic
      colitis is primarily an entity presented in the middle-aged to elderly patient
      population. Very few large series of lymphocytic colitis of childhood occurrence 
      are available in the medical literature. Ten cases each of lymphocytic colitis
      and of colonic lymphocytosis of other diagnosis, all with duodenal
      disaccharidases analysis data, were collected from the files of our institution. 
      The electronic medical records were reviewed and multiple variables were
      analyzed. The ten patients with lymphocytic colitis presented with diarrhea. Of
      these, three had abdominal pain. The age range was 2-18 years. Nearly all
      patients were Caucasian (90%) and 70% were female. Endoscopically, most had
      normal appearing colonic mucosa. Significant past medical history, family medical
      history and associated comorbidities included celiac disease, Down syndrome,
      juvenile arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. Interestingly, the most
      revealing observation was that the majority of cases (80%) were associated with
      lactase deficiency and, for the most part, gastrointestinal symptoms improved
      simply by treatment with Lactaid or avoidance of dairy products. This association
      is statistically significant. Our clinicopathological study indicates that the
      typical pediatric patient is a female Caucasian. A large of portion of the
      patients had associated lactase deficiency and improved on Lactaid supplement
      alone.

TI  - Calorie intake of enteral nutrition and clinical outcomes in acutely critically
      ill patients: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
PG  - 291-300
LID - 10.1177/0148607114544322 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The appropriate calorie intake to be provided to critically ill
      patients via enteral nutrition (EN) remains unclear. We performed a meta-analysis
      of randomized controlled trials to compare the effect of initial underfeeding and
      full feeding in acutely critically ill patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We
      searched the Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 
      databases to identify randomized controlled trials that compared underfeeding
      with full feeding in critically ill patients. The primary outcome was overall
      mortality. The secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay, length of
      intensive care unit (ICU) stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, incidence of 
      pneumonia, Clostridium difficile colitis, other infectious complications, and
      gastrointestinal intolerance. RESULTS: In total, 4 studies were included in this 
      meta-analysis. There was no significant difference in overall mortality between
      the underfeeding and full-feeding groups (odds ratio [OR], 0.94; 95% confidence
      interval [CI], 0.74-1.19; I (2) = 26.6%; P = .61). Subgroup analysis of the
      underfeeding subgroup that was fed >/=33.3% of the standard caloric requirement
      indicated that overall mortality was significantly lower in this underfeeding
      subgroup than in the full-feeding group (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.40-1.00; I (2) = 0%;
      P = .05). In contrast, no difference in overall mortality was noted between the
      underfeeding subgroup that was fed <33.3% of the standard caloric requirement and
      the full-feeding group. The length of hospital stay and length of ICU stay did
      not differ between the 2 groups. Moreover, no differences in other secondary
      clinical outcomes were noted. CONCLUSIONS: None of the analyzed clinical outcomes
      for the acutely critically ill patients were significantly influenced by the
      calorie intake of the initial EN.
