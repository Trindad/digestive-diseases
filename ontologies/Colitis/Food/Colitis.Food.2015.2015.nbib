TI  - Role of prebiotics and probiotics in pediatric diseases.
PG  - 487-497
AB  - The increasing knowledge about the composition and activities of the microflora
      has shown the close link between the bacteria and the health of the human
      organism. For this reason it has focused attention on the possibility of
      modulating the gut flora. The use of probiotics and prebiotics has increased
      enormously in recent years, more for real beneficial effects demonstrated in
      patients than for their safety profiles. However, it is recorded an
      indiscriminate use also in conditions in which there are no scientific evidence
      to support. Their use in case of immunocompromised patients or with severe and
      debilitating chronic diseases should be very prudent, because of the risk of
      complications including sepsis. The use of a probiotic cannot ignore the
      knowledge of the genus and species of the strain and in pediatric patients has
      been demonstrated their role for treating acute viral gastroenteritis and
      preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea in healthy children. Moreover
      probiotics are considered as an option for recurrent and relapsing antibiotic
      sensitive pouchitis and in select patients with mild ulcerative colitis. Further 
      studies are needed to evaluate clinical conditions that may require their use and
      to define the optimal doses and intake durations.

TI  - [Recent epidemiology of Clostridium difficile infection in Japan].
PG  - 345-58
AB  - Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a major pathogen for diarrhea in
      hospitalized patients and because of outbreak of highly virulent strain in EU and
      US, increased length of hospital stay and increased numbers of severe patients
      and deaths have become major challenges. In recent years, transmissions through
      community-acquired or food-borne infections are reported. National surveillance
      has been already performed overseas. Guidelines for preventing C. difficile
      infection (CDI) is available, and education activities are promoted for
      preventing the infection spread. Meanwhile, in Japan, medical hospitals are
      reporting individual CDI incidence, however, a large-scale research has not been 
      conducted up to the present date and therefore the entire status of CDI including
      infection of the highly virulent strain has yet to be revealed. This time, we
      performed a questionnaire-based survey at 2,537 hospitals nationwide between
      April 15, 2013 and May 31, 2013 to investigate CDI incidence, diagnosis and
      treatment. Valid responses were obtained from 321 hospitals. Regarding the annual
      number of CDI patients at all the hospitals, the highest group of hospitals
      responding "1 to 5 patients a year" was 17.8%, and the second highest group of
      hospitals responding "no patients a year" was 13.1%. In contrast, there was a
      group of hospitals with "more than 101 patients a year", which was 3.1%. This
      indicates that there was the difference in the CDI incidences among hospitals.
      According to the questionnaire results, a highest group of hospitals responding
      "0-20%" for CDI patients with serious complication such as toxic megacolon,
      gastrointestinal perforation, ileus paralytic, bacteremia, sepsis, crohn's
      disease, and ulcerative colitis was 62.6%, and for CDI patients with recurrence
      more than one, a group of hospitals answering "0 to 20%" was 56.4%, which was the
      highest. This suggested that there was only a small number of serious CDI
      patients and recurrence CDI patients in Japan. For rapid toxin detection kit used
      in CDI diagnosis, a group of hospitals using "C. DIFF QUIK CHEK COMPLETE" was
      over 40%, which showed that the kit was a major product used in Japan. And a
      group of institutions responding that they will start antibacterial medication
      such as vancomycin (VCM) and metronidazole (MNZ) as soon as after rapid
      diagnostic test, etc. showing positive results was over 70%. As for CDI
      treatment, a highest group of hospitals answering that VCM is administered orally
      at a dose of "0.5 g four times daily" was 42.1%, and a group of hospitals
      responding "10 to 14 days" for administration period was 44.2%, which was the
      highest. A highest group of hospitals answering that MNZ is administered orally
      at a dose of "250 mg four times daily" was 38.3%, and a group of hospitals
      responding "10 to 14 days" for administration period was 46.4%, which was the
      highest. Apart from VCM and MNZ, probiotics are also used for CDI treatment,
      "butyric acid bacterium" accounted for 40.8% in the probiotics group, which was
      the highest, followed by "bifidobacteria" 37.7% and "resistant lactic acid
      bacterium" 25.6%. To prevent the spread of CDI, 47.7% of the hospitals responded 
      that the patients are "isolated", while 25.6% answered the patients are
      "sometimes isolated", which means that more than 70% of patients are "isolated or
      sometimes isolated". As to what type of antiseptic drug is used for sterilizing
      hospital, 68.2% of the hospitals answered that they are using "sodium
      hypochlorite 1,000 ppm". The survey more than 300 hospitals have revealed not
      only the CDI incidences, timing of toxin test, and part of the actual therapeutic
      strategy at medical institutions in Japan but also the difference in the CDI
      incidences and therapeutic strategy among hospitals. In the future,
      epidemiological data on epidemic strain will be accumulated more in Japan as are 
      done overseas, and guidelines for CDI diagnosis and treatment will need to be
      formulated.

TI  - Up regulation of glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR) is
      associated with intestinal epithelial cells apoptosis in TNBS-induced
      experimental colitis.
PG  - 365-71
LID - 10.1016/j.prp.2015.09.019 [doi]
LID - S0344-0338(15)30018-2 [pii]
AB  - Glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR), which exists mainly in
      the liver, is a D-2-hydroxy-acid dehydrogenase that plays a critical role in the 
      formation of primary hyperoxaluria type 2 (PH2). Here, we investigated GRHPR
      expression and its potential role in both human Crohn's disease (CD) and
      experimental colitis. Murine experimental colitis models were established by
      administration of trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS). As shown by Western blot,
      significant up-regulation of GRHPR was found in TNBS-treated mice as compared
      with normal controls. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) also showed increased GRHPR
      expression, and the molecule was located in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs).
      This phenomenon also occurred in patients with Crohn's disease. Besides, in an in
      vitro study, human IEC line HT-29 cells cultured with tumor necrosis factor alpha
      (TNF-alpha) were used to evaluate the changes in expression of GRHPR. Moreover,
      overexpression of GRHPR was accompanied by active caspase-3 and cleaved poly
      ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) accumulation. Furthermore, knock-down GRHPR could
      inhibit the accumulation of active caspase-3 and cleaved PARP as shown by Western
      blot in TNF-alpha treated HT-29 cells. Flow cytometry assay indicated that
      interference of GRHPR led to increasing apoptosis of IECs. These data suggested
      that GRHPR might exert its pro-apoptosis function in IECs. Thus, GRHPR might play
      an important role in regulating IECs apoptosis, and might be a potential
      therapeutic target for CD.

TI  - Avoidance of Fiber Is Associated With Greater Risk of Crohn's Disease Flare in a 
      6-Month Period.

LID - S1542-3565(15)01713-9 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) have been
      associated with an abnormal mucosal response to the gastrointestinal microbiota. 
      Although dietary fiber affects the gastrointestinal microbiota, there is limited 
      information on the role of fiber on IBD activity. We investigated factors
      associated with fiber consumption and whether it was associated with flares in
      patients with IBD. METHODS: We collected a completed 26-item dietary survey from 
      1619 participants in the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America Partners
      Internet cohort (Crohn's disease, 1130; ulcerative colitis/indeterminate colitis,
      489). Eligible individuals were in remission based on disease activity index at
      baseline and completed a follow-up survey 6 months later. Fiber and whole grain
      consumption were categorized into quartiles and deciles. Disease flare at 6
      months was defined as a disease activity index score exceeding remission cutoff
      values, and/or an IBD-related surgical procedure or hospitalization since
      baseline. RESULTS: Participants with longer duration of disease, past history of 
      surgery, and past IBD hospitalization ate less fiber. The risks for disease flare
      differed by disease type. Compared with those in the lowest quartile of fiber
      consumption, participants with Crohn's disease in the highest quartile were less 
      likely to have a flare (adjusted odds ratios [OR], 0.58; 95% confidence interval 
      [CI], 0.37-0.90). Participants with Crohn's disease who reported that they did
      not avoid high-fiber foods were approximately 40% less likely to have a disease
      flare than those who avoided high-fiber foods (adjusted OR, 0.59; 95% CI,
      0.43-0.81). There was no association between fiber intake and flares in patients 
      with ulcerative colitis (adjusted OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 0.92-3.60). CONCLUSIONS:
      Intake of dietary fiber is associated with reduced disease flares in patients
      with Crohn's disease, but not UC. Recommendations to limit dietary fiber should
      be re-evaluated.

TI  - Safety of anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy during pregnancy in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 13205-11
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v21.i47.13205 [doi]
AB  - Treatment of inflammatory bowel disease has significantly improved since the
      introduction of biological agents, such as infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab
      pegol, and golimumab. The Food and Drug Administration has classified these
      factors in category B, which means that they do not demonstrate a fetal risk.
      However, during pregnancy fetuses are exposed to high anti-tumor necrosis factor 
      (TNF) levels that are measurable in their plasma after birth. Since antibodies
      can transfer through the placenta at the end of the second and during the third
      trimesters, it is important to know the safety profile of these drugs,
      particularly for the fetus, and whether maintaining relapse of the disease
      compensates for the potential risks of fetal exposure. The limited data available
      for the anti-TNF drugs to date have not demonstrated any significant adverse
      outcomes in the pregnant women who continued their therapy from conception to the
      first trimester of gestation. However, data suggest that anti-TNFs should be
      discontinued during the third trimester, as they may affect the immunological
      system of the newborn baby. Each decision should be individualized, based on the 
      distinct characteristics of the patient and her disease. Considering all the
      above, there is a need for more clinical studies regarding the effect of anti-TNF
      therapeutic agents on pregnancy outcomes.

TI  - Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 in Ulcerative Colitis Treatment: Systematic Review
      and Meta-analysis.
PG  - 499-505
LID - 10.15403/jgld.2014.1121.244.ecn [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) has been recommended as a
      therapeutic tool for ulcerative colitis (UC) treatment. However, to date, no
      meta-analysis has been performed on this topic. METHODS: We performed a
      literature search on PubMed, MEDLINE, Science Direct and EMBASE. We evaluated
      success rates for induction of remission, relapse rates and side effects,
      expressed as Intention-To-Treat. Odd ratios (OR), pooled OR and 95% confidence
      intervals (CI) were calculated, based on the Mantel-Haenszel method.
      Heterogeneity was assessed by using the chi2 and I2 statistics and, if present, a
      random-effects model was adopted. RESULTS: We selected six eligible trials, with 
      719 patients, 390 assigned to the study group and 329 to the control group. EcN
      induced remission in 61.6% of cases, while in the control group (mesalazine) the 
      remission was achieved in 69.5% of cases, with a mean difference of 7.9%. The
      pooled OR was 0.92 (95% CI 0.15-9.66, p=0.93). A single study showed a better
      performance of EcN than the placebo. A relapse of the disease occurred in 36.8%
      in the EcN group and in 36.1% in the control group (mesalazine), with a mean
      difference of 0.8%, OR=1.07, with a 95% CI of 0.70-1.64 (p=0.74). Side effects
      were comparable (OR=1.44, 95% CI 0.80-2.59, p=0.22). CONCLUSIONS: EcN is
      equivalent to mesalazine in preventing disease relapse, thus confirming current
      guideline recommendations. EcN seems to be as effective as controls in inducing
      remission and therefore, its use cannot be recommended as in one study the
      comparison was performed against placebo. Further studies may be helpful for this
      subject.

PG  - 215-25
LID - 10.3920/BM2015.0074 [doi]
AB  - Genetic predisposition and environmental factors, including the gut microbiota,
      have been suggested as major factors in the development and progression of atopic
      dermatitis. Hyperlipidemic human APOC1(+/+) transgenic mice display many features
      of human atopic dermatitis, such as scaling, lichenification, excoriations, and
      pruritus, along with a disturbed skin barrier function. Cytokine analysis of
      serum shows an increase of various pro-inflammatory cytokines, including
      interleukin (IL)-12p40, IL-6, and IL-1alpha, but lower levels of
      interferon-gamma. These mice also display aspects of colitis evident from
      macroscopic and histological abnormalities. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis of
      the intestine shows up-regulation of several genes associated with mast cells and
      eosinophils and this observation was confirmed by demonstrating increased numbers
      of IgE(+) and FcRepsilon(+) mast cells in the colon and in the skin. Oral
      treatment with Lactobacillus plantarum NCIMB8826 resulted in decreased numbers of
      mast cells in the colon. Moreover, this L. plantarum strain ameliorated skin
      pathology, evident from improved skin barrier integrity, absence of skin
      thickening, and less excoriations. These results suggest that modulation of
      intestinal immune homeostasis contributes to the suppression of atopic
      dermatitis.

TI  - Mucosal Barrier Depletion and Loss of Bacterial Diversity are Primary
      Abnormalities in Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis.
PG  - 462-71
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv223 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ulcerative colitis [UC] is associated with colonic mucosa
      barrier defects and bacterial dysbiosis, but these features may simply be the
      result of inflammation. Therefore, we sought to assess whether these features are
      inherently abrogated in the terminal ileum [TI] of UC patients, where
      inflammation is absent. METHODS: TI biopsies from paediatric inflammatory bowel
      disease [IBD] subsets [Crohn's disease [CD; n = 13] and UC [n = 10]], and non-IBD
      disease controls [n = 12] were histologically graded, and alcian blue/periodic
      acid-Schiff stained biopsies were quantified. The mucosal barrier was assessed
      for mucin [MUC2], immunoglobulin [Ig]A, IgG, and total bacteria (fluorescence
      in-situ hybridisation [FISH probe EUB338]) by immunofluorescence. The regulation 
      of mucin secretion was investigated by NLRP6 gene expression and
      immunofluorescence. The composition of the active mucosa-associated microbiota
      was explored by sequencing the 16S rRNA amplicon generated from total RNA.
      RESULTS: Despite the absence of ileitis, UC patients displayed ileal barrier
      depletion illustrated by reductions in mucin-containing goblet cells and mucin
      production and altered epithelial NLRP6 expression. In both CD patients with
      ileitis and UC patients with normal histology, bacteria coated with IgA and IgG
      penetrated the TI mucin layer. Biopsy 16S rRNA sequencing revealed a reduction in
      alpha-diversity by three methods [Shannon, Simpson, and Equitability indices]
      between UC and non-IBD paediatric patients. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest
      an underlying defect in the UC-afflicted intestinal tract even in the absence of 
      inflammation, implicating barrier and microbial changes as primary abnormalities 
      in UC that may play a causative role in disease development.

TI  - Probiotics in digestive diseases: focus on Lactobacillus GG.
PG  - 273-92
AB  - Probiotics are becoming increasingly important in basic and clinical research,
      but they are also a subject of considerable economic interest due to their
      expanding popularity. They are live micro-organisms which, when administered in
      adequate amounts, confer a health benefit to the host. From this very well-known 
      definition, it is clear that, unlike drugs, probiotics might be useful in healthy
      subjects to reduce the risk of developing certain diseases or to optimise some
      physiological functions. They also may offer some advantages in already ill
      persons in relieving symptoms and signs, e.g. people with acute diarrhea.
      According to current definitions, probiotics should survive both gastric acid and
      bile to reach the small intestine and colon, where they exert their effects. Many
      of these are available in a lyophilized (freeze-dried) pill form, though some are
      available in yogurt or as packets (sachets), which can be mixed into
      non-carbonated drinks. The present review focuses on three main issues: 1)
      understanding why, at present, probiotics are so interesting for doctors and
      consumers; 2) reviewing the available data on probiotic use in digestive
      diseases, in particular irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), (prevention of)
      infectious diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), non-alcoholic fatty liver 
      disease (NAFLD), and colorectal cancer (CRC); 3) highlighting the individual
      profile of Lactobacillus GG (LGG) in the above contexts, providing an assessment 
      as well as recommendations on its use in gastro-intestinal tract (GIT) disorders.
      Research studies conducted in animals and humans with the main probiotics strains
      for GIT diseases, and published from the early 1990s to 2014 have been
      considered. PubMed, Medline and Ovid were the main sources adopted for data
      retrieving. The increasing attention on probiotics is a direct consequence of the
      improvement in the techniques for studying microbiota. Until recently, its
      composition has been analysed by culture-based methods that use differential
      media to select for specific populations of bacteria according to their metabolic
      requirements. Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species are by and large the most
      commonly used probiotics. Strictly speaking, however, the term "probiotic" should
      be reserved for live microbes that have been shown in controlled human studies to
      provide a health benefit. Taking into account patients suffering from the most
      common gastrointestinal diseases, in whose establishment the GI microbiota plays 
      a key role, probiotics have to be considered as very promising agents, capable of
      beneficially modulating the intestinal ecosystem, which is perturbed in cases of 
      dysbiosis. Although more clinical data are still needed to better assess the
      clinical relevance of probiotics, to date, procariota such as Bifidobacteria and 
      Lactobacilli strains, and eucariota such as some Saccharomyces strains are among 
      the most widely used agents in GIT disorders. LGG is a well-known probiotic
      strain that was isolated more than 20 years ago by Goldin and Gorbach from a
      faecal sample of a healthy adult, based on several selection criteria: high
      adhesion in vitro, high resistance against gastric acidity and high antimicrobial
      activity against pathogens such as Salmonella. In vivo studies have also shown a 
      good persistence of LGG in the human GIT. Since its isolation, LGG has become one
      of the best clinically documented probiotic strains. A growing body of evidence
      suggests benefits such as prevention and relief of various types of diarrhoea,
      and treatment of relapsing Clostridium difficile colitis. Thus, with respect to
      both adaptation to the GIT and probiotic effects, LGG can be regarded as a
      prototypical probiotic strain.

TI  - Specific carbohydrate diet for pediatric inflammatory bowel disease in clinical
      practice within an academic IBD center.
PG  - 418-25
LID - 10.1016/j.nut.2015.08.025 [doi]
LID - S0899-9007(15)00389-5 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Despite dietary factors being implicated in the pathogenesis of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), nutritional therapy, outside of exclusive
      enteral nutrition (EEN), has not had a defined role within the treatment paradigm
      of pediatric IBD within IBD centers. Based on emerging data, Seattle Children's
      Hospital IBD Center has developed an integrated dietary program incorporating the
      specific carbohydrate diet (SCD) into its treatment paradigm. This treatment
      paradigm uses the SCD as primary therapy as well as adjunctive therapy for the
      treatment of IBD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential effects of 
      the SCD on clinical outcomes and laboratory studies of pediatric patients with
      Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: In this retrospective 
      study, we reviewed the medical records of patients with IBD on SCD. RESULTS: We
      analyzed 26 children on the SCD: 20 with CD and 6 with UC. Duration of the
      dietary therapy ranged from 3 to 48 mo. In patients with active CD (Pediatric
      Crohn's Disease activity index [PCDAI] >10), PCDAI dropped from 32.8 +/- 13.2 at 
      baseline to 20.8 +/- 16.6 by 4 +/- 2 wk, and to 8.8 +/- 8.5 by 6 mo. The mean
      Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index for patients with active UC decreased
      from a baseline of 28.3 +/- 10.3 to 20.0 +/- 17.3 at 4 +/- 2 wk, to 18.3 +/- 31.7
      at 6 mo. CONCLUSION: This retrospective review provides evidence that the SCD can
      be integrated into a tertiary care center and may improve clinical and laboratory
      parameters for pediatric patients with nonstructuring, nonpenetrating CD as well 
      as UC. Further prospective studies are needed to fully assess the safety and
      efficacy of the SCD in pediatric patients with IBD.

LID - 10.3920/bm2015.0037 [doi]
AB  - Although interest in using probiotics to prevent and treat intestinal diseases is
      increasing, the effects of specific probiotic strains still remain unclear. Here,
      we assess the therapeutic effects of two probiotic strains, Lactobacillus
      rhamnosus NutRes 1 and Bifidobacterium breve NutRes 204 on a dextran sodium
      sulphate (DSS)-induced chronic murine colitis model. The chronic colitis was
      induced by two DSS treatment cycles with a rest period of 10 days (the remission 
      or resolution phase). The probiotic supplementation was started during the
      resolution phase, after the first DSS treatment cycle, and continued until the
      end of the experiment. In addition to clinical observations made during the
      experiment, cellular infiltration was measured along with mRNA expression of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, T cell-associated cytokines, and Toll like receptors 
      (TLR) in the inflamed colon after second DSS treatment cycle. L. rhamnosus, but
      not B. breve, rapidly and effectively improved the DSS-induced bloody diarrhoea
      during the resolution phase. However, a contradictory effect by both probiotic
      strains on the faecal condition was found after re-induction of colitis. The
      worsening of the faecal condition was accompanied by a reduced number of
      neutrophils and increased expression of interferon-gamma in the colons of
      DSS-treated mice. Furthermore, an increased expression of TLR2, TLR6 and
      pro-inflammatory markers including chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2, interleukin
      (IL)-1beta, tumour necrosis factor alpha and IL-6 was found in DSS-treated mice
      with L. rhamnosus supplementation. These results indicate that therapeutic
      administration of specific probiotics might be beneficial during the resolution
      phase of colitis. However, caution should be taken as specific probiotic
      treatments reduce neutrophil influx, which may be the reason of exacerbation of
      chronic colitis.

TI  - Highly Heterogeneous Probiotic Lactobacillus Species in Healthy Iranians with Low
      Functional Activities.
PG  - e0144467
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0144467 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have been considered as potentially
      probiotic organisms due to their potential human health properties. This study
      aimed to evaluate both in vitro and in vivo, the potential probiotic properties
      of Lactobacillus species isolated from fecal samples of healthy humans in Iran.
      METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 470 LAB were initially isolated from 53 healthy
      individual and characterized to species level. Of these, 88 (86%) were
      Lactobacillus species. Biochemical and genetic fingerprinting with Phene-Plate
      system (PhP-LB) and RAPD-PCR showed that the isolates were highly diverse
      consisted of 67(76.1%) and 75 (85.2%) single types (STs) and a diversity indices 
      of 0.994 and 0.997, respectively. These strains were tested for production of
      adhesion to Caco-2 cells, antibacterial activity, production of B12,
      anti-proliferative effect and interleukin-8 induction on gut epithelial cell
      lines and antibiotic resistance against 9 commonly used antibiotics. Strains
      showing the characteristics consistent with probiotic strains, were further
      tested for their anti-inflammatory effect in mouse colitis model. Only one L.
      brevis; one L. rhamnosus and two L. plantarum were shown to have significant
      probiotic properties. These strains showed shortening the length of colon
      compared to dextran sulfate sodium and disease activity index (DAI) was also
      significantly reduced in mouse. CONCLUSION: Low number of LAB with potential
      probiotic activity as well as high diversity of lactobacilli species was evident 
      in Iranian population. It also suggest that specific strains of L. plantarum, L. 
      brevis and L. rhamnosus with anti-inflammatory effect in mouse model of colitis
      could be used as a potential probiotic candidate in inflammatory bowel disease to
      decrease the disease activity index.

AB  - Clostridium difficile is being recognized as a growing threat to many health-care
      systems. Epidemiology data shows that infection rates are soaring and the disease
      burden is increasing. Despite the efficacy of standard treatments, it is becoming
      evident that novel therapeutics will be required to tackle this disease. These
      new treatments aim to enhance the intestinal microbial barrier, activate the
      immune system and neutralize the toxins that mediate this disease. Many of these 
      therapies are still in the beginning stages of investigation, however, in the
      next few years, more clinical data will become available to help implement many
      of these exciting new therapeutic approaches.

AB  - This study was carried out to investigate the anti-inflammatory potentials of a
      38 kDa glycoprotein isolated from Styrax japonica Siebold et al Zuccarini (SJSZ
      glycoprotein). We found that SJSZ glycoprotein has concentration-dependent
      scavenging activity against DPPH and hydroxyl radicals in the cell-free systems. 
      In colonic epithelial cells (HCT116 cells), the results showed that SJSZ
      glycoprotein inhibits the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by 
      glucose/glucose oxidase (G/GO) in a concentration-dependent manner. Experimental 
      mouse colitis was induced by adding dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to the drinking 
      water at a concentration of 4% (w/v) for 7 days. We figured out that
      administration of SJSZ glycoprotein (10 mg/kg) lowers the levels of disease
      activity index, myeloperoxidase activity, and histological inflammation in
      DSS-treated mice. In addition, SJSZ glycoprotein inhibited plasmic thiobarbituric
      acid reactive substances (TBARS) formation, nitric oxide (NO) production, and
      lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, accompanying the inhibition of colonic
      inflammatory signal proteins (NF-kappaB, iNOS, and COX-2) and
      inflammation-related cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha). These results
      indicate that SJSZ glycoprotein inhibits oxidative and pro-inflammatory responses
      in mouse colitis.

AB  - Dairy propionibacteria (PAB) are used as a ripening starter in combination with
      Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) for dairy products such as Swiss-type cheese. LAB and 
      PAB have also been studied for their probiotic properties but little is still
      known about their individual and/or synergistic beneficial effects within dairy
      matrices. In the context of a rising incidence of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, it
      has become crucial to evaluate the immunomodulatory potential of bacteria
      ingested in large numbers via dairy products. We therefore selected different
      strains and combinations of technological LAB and PAB. We determined their
      immunomodulatory potential by IL-10 and IL-12 induction, in human peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells, on either single or mixed cultures, grown on laboratory 
      medium or directly in milk. Milk was fermented with selected anti-inflammatory
      strains of LAB or PAB/LAB mixed cultures and the resulting bacterial fractions
      were also evaluated for these properties, together with starter viability and
      optimum technological aspects. The most promising fermented milks were evaluated 
      in the context of TNBS- or DSS-induced colitis in mice. The improvement in
      inflammatory parameters evidenced an alleviation of colitis symptoms as a result 
      of fermented milk consumption. This effect was clearly strain-dependent and
      modulated by growth within a fermented dairy product. These findings offer new
      tools and perspectives for the development of immunomodulatory fermented dairy
      products for targeted populations.

AB  - Chronic diarrhoea is a common presenting symptom in both primary care medicine
      and in specialized gastroenterology clinics. It is estimated that >5% of the
      population has chronic diarrhoea and nearly 40% of these patients are older than 
      60 years. Clinicians often need to select the best diagnostic approach to these
      patients and choose between the multiple diagnostic tests available. In 2014 the 
      Catalan Society of Gastroenterology formed a working group with the main
      objective of creating diagnostic algorithms based on clinical practice and to
      evaluate diagnostic tests and the scientific evidence available for their use.
      The GRADE system was used to classify scientific evidence and strength of
      recommendations. The consensus document contains 28 recommendations and 6
      diagnostic algorithms. The document also describes criteria for referral from
      primary to specialized care.

AB  - Diverse T help (Th) cells play a crucial role in the processing and maintaining
      of chronic inflammation as seen in ulcerative colitis (UC). Th9, a novel subset
      of Th cells that primarily produces interleukin (IL)-9, has recently been
      associated with the development of inflammatory diseases. In this study, we
      evaluated the presentation of Th9 cells in inflamed tissues of human and
      experimental mouse UC, and examined the therapeutic efficiency of anti Th9
      cytokine IL-9 in the experimental mouse UC. Using immunohistochemistry (IHC), we 
      evaluated the presentation of Th9 cells labelled by transcriptional factor PU.1
      in both human and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced mouse colitis biopsies.
      The results showed that increased PU.1 positive Th9 cells were mainly located in 
      the lamina propria in relative with the controls, intraepithelial Th9 cells can
      also be observed but at low density. Double IHCs revealed that most of PU.1
      positive cells were CD3 positive lymphocytes in human UC specimens. Anti-IL-9
      antibody injection for 2 weeks reduced the severity of inflammation in DSS
      induced colitis mice. Our results suggest that The Th9/IL-9 is involved in the
      pathogenesis of UC.

TI  - Food Protein-Induced Non-Immunoglobulin E-Mediated Allergic Colitis in Infants
      and Older Children: What Cytokines Are Involved?
PG  - 61-8
LID - 10.1159/000441471 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) is mostly a
      non-immunoglobulin E-mediated disease where a T-cell-mediated reaction to cow's
      milk protein has been suggested. We determined the expression of transforming
      growth factor (TGF)-beta, TGF-beta receptor-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha,
      CD86, and CD23 on the colon mucosa to investigate their roles in the pathogenesis
      of the two subtypes of FPIAP, i.e. infantile FPIAP and FPIAP in older children.
      METHODS: Group 1 comprised children with infantile FPIAP (age <6 months, n = 21),
      group 2 referred to FPIAP in older children (age >1.5 years, n = 7), and group 3 
      included children with juvenile hyperplastic polyps (n = 22). Immunohistochemical
      staining of colonic biopsy specimens was performed. RESULTS: The expression of
      TNF-alpha was significantly higher in groups 1 and 2 compared to group 3. Group 2
      patients had a significantly lower TGF-beta expression compared to the other
      groups. The expression of CD86 was higher in group 1 than in group 3 (p = 0.012).
      Eosinophil counts per high-power field in the lamina propria were significantly
      correlated with CD86 expression (p = 0.026, r = 0.388). CONCLUSION: Our results
      suggest that TNF-alpha is implicated in the pathogenesis of both types of FPIAP. 
      The decreased activity of TGF-beta receptor-1 accompanied by the increased
      expression of CD86 in infants and the decreased activity of TGF-beta in older
      children appear to play a role in the development of FPIAP.

TI  - Anti-inflammatory Effects of Poly-L-lysine in Intestinal Mucosal System Mediated 
      by Calcium-Sensing Receptor Activation.
PG  - 10437-47
LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.5b03812 [doi]
AB  - Calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis
      and promoting recovery of damaged intestinal epithelial cells (IECs).
      Poly-L-lysine (PL) is a basic polypeptide identified for its role in the
      activation of CaSR through allosteric binding. The primary goal of the current
      study was to identify the modulatory effect of PL on intestinal inflammation and 
      to determine whether these effects were mediated by CaSR activation. We used
      human intestinal epithelial cell lines, Caco-2 and HT-29, to assess PL
      anti-inflammatory activities in vitro. We found that PL reduced the IL-8
      secretion from tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-treated human intestinal
      epithelial cell lines. On the other hand, the gene expression of pro-inflammatory
      cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta was inhibited by PL supplementation. We
      subsequently evaluated the anti-inflammatory activity of PL in vivo using a
      DSS-induced mouse colitis model. PL supplementation was shown to prevent dextran 
      sulfate sodium salt (DSS)-induced loss of weight, colitic symptoms, and
      shortening of colon length but maintained colonic morphology. The
      pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in the mouse colon, including TNF-alpha,
      IL-6, INF-gamma, IL-17, and IL-1beta, was significantly up-regulated by DSS
      treatment, but was inhibited upon PL administration. As shown by the results from
      both in vitro and in vivo studies, the reduction of inflammatory cytokine
      production caused by PL was reversed by NPS-2143 pretreatment. In the present
      study, we provide evidence that PL exerts anti-inflammatory effects on the gut
      system, which is primarily mediated by allosteric ligand activation of CaSR.

AB  - The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is multifactorial with data 
      suggesting the role of a disturbed interaction between the gut and the intestinal
      microbiota. A defective mucosal barrier may result in increased intestinal
      permeability which promotes the exposition to luminal content and triggers an
      immunological response that promotes intestinal inflammation. IBD patients
      display several defects in the many specialized components of mucosal barrier,
      from the mucus layer composition to the adhesion molecules that regulate
      paracellular permeability. These alterations may represent a primary dysfunction 
      in Crohn's disease, but they may also perpetuate chronic mucosal inflammation in 
      ulcerative colitis. In clinical practice, several studies have documented that
      changes in intestinal permeability can predict IBD course. Functional tests, such
      as the sugar absorption tests or the novel imaging technique using confocal laser
      endomicroscopy, allow an in vivo assessment of gut barrier integrity. Antitumor
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) therapy reduces mucosal inflammation and
      restores intestinal permeability in IBD patients. Butyrate, zinc, and some
      probiotics also ameliorate mucosal barrier dysfunction but their use is still
      limited and further studies are needed before considering permeability
      manipulation as a therapeutic target in IBD.

      to Galectin-1.
PG  - 1575-85
LID - 10.1002/jcp.25249 [doi]
AB  - Galectins play key roles in the inflammatory cascade. In this study, we aimed to 
      analyze the effect of galectin-1 (Gal-1) in the function of intestinal epithelial
      cells (IECs) isolated from healthy and inflamed mucosa. IECs isolated from mice
      or patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) were incubated with different 
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, and Gal-1 binding, secretion of homeostatic factors
      and viability were assessed. Experimental models of food allergy and colitis were
      used to evaluate the in vivo influence of inflammation on Gal-1 binding and
      modulation of IECs. We found an enhanced binding of Gal-1 to: (a) murine IECs
      exposed to IL-1beta, TNF, and IL-13; (b) IECs from inflamed areas in intestinal
      tissue from IBD patients; (c) small bowel of allergic mice; and (d) colon from
      mice with experimental colitis. Our results showed that low concentrations of
      Gal-1 favored a tolerogenic micro-environment, whereas high concentrations of
      this lectin modulated viability of IECs through mechanisms involving activation
      of caspase-9 and modulation of Bcl-2 protein family members. Our results showed
      that, when added in the presence of diverse pro-inflammatory cytokines such as
      tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-13 and IL-5, Gal-1 differentially promoted the
      secretion of growth factors including thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP),
      epidermal growth factor (EGF), IL-10, IL-25, and transforming growth factor
      (TGF-beta1 ). In conclusion, we found an augmented binding of Gal-1 to IECs when 
      exposed in vitro or in vivo to inflammatory stimuli, showing different effects
      depending on Gal-1 concentration. These findings highlight the importance of the 
      inflammatory micro-environment of mucosal tissues in modulating IECs
      susceptibility to the immunoregulatory lectin Gal-1 and its role in epithelial
      cell homeostasis.

TI  - Probiotic yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus CIDCA 8154 shows anti-inflammatory and
      anti-oxidative stress properties in in vivo models.
PG  - 83-93
LID - 10.3920/BM2015.0066 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are complex affections with increasing
      incidence worldwide. Multiple factors are involved in the development and
      maintenance of the symptoms including enhanced oxidative stress in intestinal
      mucosa. The conventional therapeutic approaches for IBDs are based on the use
      anti-inflammatory drugs with important collateral effects and partial efficacy.
      In the present work we tested the anti-inflammatory capacity of Kluyveromyces
      marxianus CIDCA 8154 in different models. In vitro, we showed that the
      pretreatment of epithelial cells with the yeast reduce the levels of
      intracellular reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, in a murine model of trinitro
      benzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis, yeast-treated animals showed a reduced
      histopathological score (P<0.05) and lower levels of circulating interleukin 6
      (P<0.05). The capacity to modulate oxidative stress in vivo was assessed using a 
      Caenorhabditis elegans model. The yeast was able to protect the nematodes from
      oxidative stress by modulating the SKN-1 transcription factor trough the DAF-2
      pathway. These results indicate that K. marxianus CIDCA 8154 could control the
      intestinal inflammation and cellular oxidative stress. Deciphering the mechanisms
      of action of different probiotics might be useful for the rational formulation of
      polymicrobial products containing microorganisms targeting different
      anti-inflammatory pathways.

LID - 10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-15-180 [doi]
AB  - Shiga toxin (Stx)-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) strains are food- and
      waterborne pathogens that are often transmitted via beef products or fresh
      produce. STEC strains cause both sporadic infections and outbreaks, which may
      result in hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome. STEC strains may
      elaborate Stx1, Stx2, and/or subtypes of those toxins. Epidemiological evidence
      indicates that STEC that produce subtypes Stx2a, Stx2c, and/or Stx2d are more
      often associated with serious illness. The Stx2d subtype becomes more toxic to
      Vero cells after incubation with intestinal mucus or elastase, a process named
      "activation." Stx2d is not generally found in the E. coli serotypes most commonly
      connected to STEC outbreaks. However, STEC strains that are stx2d positive can be
      isolated from foods, an occurrence that gives rise to the question of whether
      those food isolates are potential human pathogens. In this study, we examined 14 
      STEC strains from fresh produce that were stx2d positive and found that they all 
      produced the mucus-activatable Stx2d and that a subset of the strains tested were
      virulent in streptomycin-treated mice.

AB  - This report summarises talks given at the 8th International Yakult Symposium,
      held on 23-24 April 2015 in Berlin. Two presentations explored different aspects 
      of probiotic intervention: the small intestine as a probiotic target and
      inclusion of probiotics into integrative approaches to gastroenterology.
      Probiotic recommendations in gastroenterology guidelines and current data on
      probiotic efficacy in paediatric patients were reviewed. Updates were given on
      probiotic and gut microbiota research in obesity and obesity-related diseases,
      the gut-brain axis and development of psychobiotics, and the protective effects
      of equol-producing strains for prostate cancer. Recent studies were presented on 
      probiotic benefit for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and people with HIV, as
      well as protection against the adverse effects of a short-term high-fat diet.
      Aspects of probiotic mechanisms of activity were discussed, including
      immunomodulatory mechanisms and metabolite effects, the anti-inflammatory
      properties of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, the relationship between
      periodontitis, microbial production of butyrate in the oral cavity and ageing,
      and the pathogenic mechanisms of Campylobacter. Finally, an insight was given on 
      a recent expert meeting, which re-examined the probiotic definition, advised on
      the appropriate use and scope of the term and outlined different probiotic
      categories and the prevalence of different mechanisms of activity.

TI  - Zinc intake and risk of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis: a prospective
      cohort study.
PG  - 1995-2005
LID - 10.1093/ije/dyv301 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diet plays a role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) and
      ulcerative colitis (UC). Dietary zinc may influence risk of disease through
      effects on autophagy, innate and adaptive immune response and maintenance of the 
      intestinal barrier. METHODS: We analysed data from 170 776 women from the Nurses 
      Health Study I and Nurses Health Study II, who were followed for 26 years. Zinc
      intake was assessed using semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaires
      administered every 4 years. Incident CD and UC were ascertained by medical record
      review. Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for potential confounders
      determined the independent association between zinc intake and incident disease. 
      RESULTS: Over 3 317 550 person-years (p-y) of follow-up, we identified 269
      incident cases of CD and 338 incident cases of UC. Zinc intake ranged from 9
      mg/day in the lowest quintile to 27 mg/day in the highest quintile. Compared with
      women with the lowest quintile of intake, the multivariate hazard ratios (HR) for
      CD were 0.92 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.65 - 1.29) for women in the second 
      quintile of intake, 0.60 (95% CI, 0.40 - 0.89) for the third quintile, 0.57 (95% 
      CI, 0.38 - 0.86) for fourth quintile and 0.74 (95% CI, 0.50 - 1.10) for the
      highest quintile (Ptrend = 0.003). The association was stronger for dietary zinc 
      (HR 0.63, 95% CI, 0.43 - 0.93, comparing extreme quintiles) than for zinc intake 
      from supplements. Neither dietary nor supplemental zinc modified risk of UC.
      CONCLUSIONS: In two large prospective cohorts of women, intake of zinc was
      inversely associated with risk of CD but not UC.

AB  - Probiotics are foods or products that contain live microorganisms that benefit
      the host when administered. In this clinical review, we evaluate the literature
      associated with using probiotics in common pediatric gastrointestinal disorders, 
      focusing specifically on antibiotic-associated diarrhea, acute gastroenteritis,
      Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), colic, inflammatory bowel disease, and
      functional gastrointestinal diseases. Meta-analysis of several randomized
      controlled trials have confirmed benefit for the administration of Lactobacillus 
      rhamnosus GG and Saccharomyces boulardii to prevent antibiotic-associated
      diarrhea and to treat acute infectious diarrhea. Individual studies have also
      suggested benefit of probiotics to prevent acute gastroenteritis and serve as an 
      adjunct in ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, CDI,
      functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, and colic in breastfed
      babies. Although promising, larger well-designed studies need to confirm these
      findings. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend probiotics for
      the treatment of constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome or Crohn's
      disease.

TI  - Interleukin-6 stimulates aerobic glycolysis by regulating PFKFB3 at early stage
      of colorectal cancer.
PG  - 215-24
LID - 10.3892/ijo.2015.3225 [doi]
AB  - Chronic inflammation is a well-known etiological factor for colorectal cancer
      (CRC) and cancer cells are known to preferentially metabolize glucose through
      aerobic glycolysis. However, the connection between chronic inflammation and
      aerobic glycolysis in the development of CRC is largely unexplored. The present
      study investigated whether interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pro-inflammatory cytokine,
      promotes the development of CRC by regulating the aerobic glycolysis and the
      underlying molecular mechanisms. In colitis-associated CRC mouse, anti-IL-6
      receptor antibody treatment reduced the incidence of CRC and decreased the
      expression of key genes in aerobic glycolysis, whereas the plasma concentrations 
      of glucose and lactate were not affected. Consistently, IL-6 treatment stimulated
      aerobic glycolysis, upregulated key genes in aerobic glycolysis and promoted cell
      proliferation and migration in SW480 and SW1116 CRC cells.
      6-phoshofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase-3 (PFKFB3) was the most
      downregulated gene by anti-IL-6 receptor antibody in colorectal adenoma tissues. 
      Further analysis in human samples revealed overexpression of PFKFB3 in colorectal
      adenoma and adenocarcinoma tissues, which was also associated with lymph node
      metastasis, intravascular cancer embolus and TNM stage. In addition, the effect
      of IL-6 on CRC cells can be abolished by knocking down PRKFB3 through siRNA
      transfection. Our data suggest that chronic inflammation promotes the development
      of CRC by stimulating aerobic glycolysis and IL-6 is functioning, at least
      partly, through regulating PFKFB3 at early stage of CRC.

TI  - Review article: insights into colonic protein fermentation, its modulation and
      potential health implications.
PG  - 181-96
LID - 10.1111/apt.13456 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Beneficial effects of carbohydrate fermentation on gastrointestinal
      health are well established. Conversely, protein fermentation generates harmful
      metabolites but their relevance to gastrointestinal health is poorly understood. 
      AIM: To review the effects of increased protein fermentation on biomarkers of
      colonic health, factors influencing fermentative activity and potential for
      dietary modulation to minimise detrimental effects. METHODS: A literature search 
      was performed in PubMed, Medline, EMBASE and Google scholar for clinical and
      pre-clinical studies using search terms - 'dietary protein', 'fermentation',
      'putrefaction', 'phenols', 'sulphide', 'branched-chain fatty acid', 'carbohydrate
      fermentation', 'gastrointestinal'. RESULTS: High protein, reduced carbohydrate
      diets alter the colonic microbiome, favouring a potentially pathogenic and
      pro-inflammatory microbiota profile, decreased short-chain fatty acid production 
      and increased ammonia, phenols and hydrogen sulphide concentrations. These
      metabolites largely compromise the colonic epithelium structure, causing mucosal 
      inflammation but may also directly modulate the enteric nervous system and
      intestinal motility. Increased protein fermentation as a result of a high-protein
      intake can be attenuated by addition of oligosaccharides, resistant starch and
      nonstarch polysaccharides and a reduction in total protein or specifically,
      aromatic and sulphur-containing amino acids. These factors may have clinical
      importance as novel therapeutic approaches to problems, in which protein
      fermentation may be implicated, such as malodorous flatus, irritable bowel
      syndrome, ulcerative colitis and prevention of colorectal cancer. CONCLUSIONS:
      The direct clinical relevance of excessive protein fermentation in the
      pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome, malodorous flatus and ulcerative
      colitis are underexplored. Manipulating dietary carbohydrate and protein intake
      have potential therapeutic applications in such settings and warrant further
      clinical studies.

TI  - Oleanolic acid ameliorates dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis in mice by
      restoring the balance of Th17/Treg cells and inhibiting NF-kappaB signaling
      pathway.

AB  - In a preliminary experiment, it was found that oleanolic acid (OA), which is
      widely distributed in food and medicinal plants, inhibited interleukin
      (IL)-6/tumor growth factor beta-induced differentiation of splenic T cells into
      Th17 cells. Moreover, OA induced the differentiation of splenic T cells into Treg
      cells. Therefore, we examined the anti-inflammatory effect of OA in mice with
      dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. Oral administration of OA
      significantly inhibited DSS-induced colon shortening, macroscopic score, and
      myeloperoxidase activity. Treatment with OA inhibited DSS-induced differentiation
      to Th17 cells and downregulated the expression of RORgammat and IL-17 in the
      lamina propria of colon and Treg cell differentiation and Foxp3 and IL-10
      expression were increased. OA treatment increased the DSS-suppressed expression
      of tight junction proteins such as ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1 in the colon.
      Moreover, OA treatment inhibited DSS-induced expression of tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, and IL-17, the activation of NF-kappaB and 
      mitogen-activated protein kinases, and increased IL-10 expression. OA also
      inhibited the activation of NF-kappaB and expression of proinflammatory cytokines
      in LPS-stimulated peritoneal macrophages. These findings suggest that OA may
      ameliorate inflammatory diseases such as colitis by inhibiting Th17 cell
      differentiation and increasing Treg cell differentiation.

TI  - The effect of Clostridium butyricum MIYAIRI on the prevention of pouchitis and
      alteration of the microbiota profile in patients with ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 939-49

AB  - PURPOSE: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, relapsing, and refractory disorder
      of the intestine. Total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) 
      is the preferred and standard surgical procedure for patients' refractory to
      medical therapy. Pouchitis is one of the most common long-term complications
      after IPAA. In the present study, the safety and efficacy of Clostridium
      butyricum MIYAIRI (CBM) as a probiotic were examined. METHODS: A randomized and
      placebo-controlled study was performed. Seventeen patients were recruited from
      2007 to 2013. Nine tablets of MIYA-BM((R)) or placebo were orally administered
      once daily. The cumulative pouchitis-free survival, pouch condition (using the
      modified pouch disease activity index), and blood parameters were evaluated. A
      fecal sample analysis was also performed. RESULTS: Subjects were randomly
      allocated to receive MIYA-BM or placebo (9 and 8 subjects, respectively). One
      subject in the MIYA-BM group and four subjects in the placebo group developed
      pouchitis. No side effects occurred in either group. Characteristic intestinal
      flora was observed in each group. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that probiotic
      therapy with CBM achieved favorable results with minimal side effects and might
      be a useful complementary therapy for the prevention of pouchitis in patients
      with UC who have undergone IPAA.

TI  - Food-related Quality of Life in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Development and
      Validation of a Questionnaire.
PG  - 194-201
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv192 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Psychosocial factors surrounding eating and drinking, such as
      enjoying food, managing restrictions, and maintaining social relationships,
      remain under-researched in inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]. This study aimed to 
      develop and validate a food-related quality of life [FR-QoL] questionnaire to
      systematically measure these issues in the IBD population. METHODS: Following
      semi-structured interviews with 28 IBD patients, 150 potential questionnaire
      items were generated. These were ranked by 100 IBD patients, and items were
      removed based on ceiling/floor effects and high inter-item correlations [> 0.7], 
      with 41 items being retained. In total, 323 IBD patients, 100 asthma patients
      [chronic disease control], and 117 healthy controls completed the FR-QoL
      questionnaire, alongside generic and disease-specific QoL and food satisfaction
      questionnaires. Principal components analysis [PCA], construct and discriminant
      validity, and test-retest reliability were calculated. RESULTS: Twelve items were
      removed following PCA. The reduced questionnaire [FR-QoL-29] explained 63.9% of
      the variance [Cronbach's alpha = 0.96]. FR-QoL-29 correlated significantly with
      generic QoL [r = 0.697], depression [r = -0.519], anxiety [r = -0.531], and food 
      satisfaction [r = 0.701]. The FR-QoL-29 sumscores were significantly lower for
      IBD (89.5, standard deviation [SD] 28.6) than asthma [125.4, SD 24.1; p < 0.001] 
      and healthy volunteers [123.0, SD 16.5; p<0.001]. Within IBD, worse food-related 
      QoL was found in those with moderate/high disease activity [66.7, SD 22.1]
      compared with remission/low disease activity [92.5, SD 28.1]. Test-retest
      reliability was good (intra-class correlation [ICC] = 0.83, 95% confidence
      interval [CI] = 0.76:0.88). CONCLUSIONS: The FR-QoL-29 shows good reliability and
      validity across a range of IBD characteristics. This easily administered
      questionnaire is a useful tool in identifying poor food-related QoL and in the
      future may identify areas for intervention.

TI  - A Preliminary Study Examining the Binding Capacity of Akkermansia muciniphila and
      Desulfovibrio spp., to Colonic Mucin in Health and Ulcerative Colitis.
PG  - e0135280
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0135280 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Akkermansia muciniphila and Desulfovibrio spp. are commensal microbes
      colonising the mucus gel layer of the colon. Both species have the capacity to
      utilise colonic mucin as a substrate. A. muciniphila degrades colonic mucin,
      while Desulfovibrio spp. metabolise the sulfate moiety of sulfated mucins.
      Altered abundances of these microorganisms have been reported in ulcerative
      colitis (UC). However their capacity to bind to human colonic mucin, and whether 
      this binding capacity is affected by changes in mucin associated with UC, remain 
      to be defined. METHODS: Mucin was isolated from resected colon from control
      patients undergoing resection for colonic cancer (n = 7) and patients undergoing 
      resection for UC (n = 5). Isolated mucin was purified and printed onto mucin
      microarrays. Binding of reference strains and three clinical isolates of A.
      muciniphila and Desulfovibrio spp. to purified mucin was investigated. RESULTS:
      Both A. muciniphila and Desulfovibro spp. bound to mucin. The reference strain
      and all clinical isolates of A. muciniphila showed increased binding capacity for
      UC mucin (p < .005). The Desulfovibrio reference strain showed increased affinity
      for UC mucin. The mucin binding profiles of clinical isolates of Desulfovibrio
      spp. were specific to each isolate. Two isolates showed no difference in binding.
      One UC isolate bound with increased affinity to UC mucin (p < .005). CONCLUSION: 
      These preliminary data suggest that differences exist in the mucin binding
      capacity of isolates of A. muciniphila and Desulfovibrio spp. This study
      highlights the mucin microarray platform as a means of studying the ability of
      bacteria to interact with colonic mucin in health and disease.

TI  - High Prevalence of Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Autoantibodies in Infants with Food
      Protein-Induced Proctitis/Proctocolitis: Autoimmunity Involvement?
PG  - 902863
LID - 10.1155/2015/902863 [doi]
AB  - Background. Food protein-induced proctitis/proctocolitis (FPIP) is the most
      common noninfectious colitis in children in the first year of life. Along with
      the overall clinical symptoms, diarrhoea and rectal bleeding are the main
      manifestations of the disease. There is no routine noninvasive test that would be
      specific for this type of colitis. The aim of our study was to find a noninvasive
      laboratory test or tests that may be helpful in differential diagnosis of food
      protein-induced proctitis/proctocolitis. Methods. ANA, ANCA, ASCA, a-EMA, a-tTg, 
      specific IgE, total IgE, IgG, IgA, IgM, and concentration of serum calprotectin
      were measured in a group of 25 patients with colitis and 18 children with other
      diagnoses. Results. Atypical-pANCA antibodies of IgG isotype were detected in the
      sera of 24 patients by the method of indirect immunofluorescence, and 5 patients 
      showed also the positivity of IgA isotype. In control samples these
      autoantibodies were not detected. Other autoantibodies were not demonstrated in
      either patient or control group. Conclusions. Of the parameters tested in
      noninfectious colitis, atypical-pANCA on ethanol-fixed granulocytes appears to be
      a suitable serological marker of food protein-induced proctitis/proctocolitis and
      suggests a possible involvement of an autoimmune mechanisms in the pathogenesis
      of this disease.

AB  - Microscopic colitis is a common cause of chronic diarrhea. It is characterized by
      non-bloody watery diarrhea with macroscopically normal colonic mucosa. Its
      specific histological characteristics confirm the diagnosis. Two distinct
      histological forms can be identified, namely, collagenous colitis and lymphocytic
      colitis. In collagenous colitis, a thick colonic subepithelial collagenous
      deposit can be observed, whereas in lymphocytic colitis, a pronounced
      intraepithelial lymphocytic inflammation in the absence of a thickened collagen
      band can be identified. Microscopic colitis occurs more frequently in elderly
      females and its etiology is believed to be multifactorial, although smoking and
      consumption of several drugs have been identified as risks factors for the
      development of the disease. The treatment is based on avoiding the risks factors 
      and administration of oral budesonide.

      About Diet?
PG  - 760-79
LID - 10.1177/0884533615606898 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, 
      and unclassified IBD, continues to cause significant morbidity. While its
      incidence is increasing, no clear etiology and no cure have yet been discovered. 
      Recent findings suggest that IBD may have a multifactorial etiology, where
      complex interactions between genetics, epigenetics, environmental factors
      (including diet but also infections, antibiotics, and sanitation), and host
      immune system lead to abnormal immune responses and chronic inflammation. Over
      the past years, the role of altered gut microbiota (in both composition and
      function) in IBD pathogenesis has emerged as an outstanding area of interest.
      According to new findings, gut dysbiosis may appear as a key element in
      initiation of inflammation in IBD and its complications. Moreover, complex
      metagenomic studies provide possibilities to distinguish between IBD types and
      appreciate severity and prognosis of the disease, as well as response to therapy.
      This review provides an updated knowledge of recent findings linking altered
      bacterial composition and functions, viruses, and fungi to IBD pathogenesis. It
      also highlights the complex genetic, epigenetic, immune, and microbial
      interactions in relation to environmental factors (including diet). We overview
      the actual options to manipulate the altered microbiota, such as modified diet,
      probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, antibiotics, and fecal transplantation.
      Future possible therapies are also included. Targeting altered microbiota could
      be the next therapeutic personalized approach, but more research and
      well-designed comparative prospective studies are required to formulate adequate 
      directions for prevention and therapy.

PG  - 157-61
AB  - Toxins produced by the bacteria are of particular interest as potential cargo
      combat possible for use in a terrorist attack or war. Shiga toxin is usually
      produced by shiga toxigenic strains of Escherichia coli (STEC - shigatoxigenic
      Escherichia coli). To infection occurs mostly after eating contaminated beef.
      Clinical syndromes associated with Shiga toxin diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis,
      hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS - hemolytic uremic syndrome) or thrombotic
      thrombocytopenic purpura. Treatment is symptomatic. In HUS, in which mortality
      during an epidemic reaches 20%, extending the kidney injury dialysis may be
      necessary. Exposure to tetanus toxin produced by Clostridium tetani, resulting in
      the most generalized tetanus, characterized by increased muscle tension and
      painful contractions of individual muscle groups. In the treatment beyond
      symptomatic behavior (among others spasticity medications, anticonvulsants,
      muscle relaxants) is used tetanus antitoxin and antibiotics (metronidazole
      choice). A common complication is acute respiratory failure - then it is
      necessary to implement mechanical ventilation.

AB  - Rapid progress has been made to understand the pathophysiology of inflammatory
      bowel diseases and to identify new treatments. Interaction of the gut microbiota 
      on the host inflammatory response has suggested that alternative therapies, such 
      as probiotics, might have a complementary role in treating and preventing disease
      flares. Multiple probiotics and their formulations have been studied for both the
      induction and maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis (UC); however,
      mainly Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 and VSL#3 have been shown to provide
      significant benefits for the prevention and treatment of mild to moderate UC.
      Although these data are promising, there is still a paucity of robust,
      randomized-controlled trials to suggest that probiotics be utilized as part of a 
      standard treatment regimen. With continued research and a movement toward
      carefully selected, individualized management based on an individual's specific
      microbiota composition and function, probiotics may become an integral part of
      tailored therapy for UC.

AB  - The alterations in the gut microbiota observed in patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease and in particular in Crohn's disease and in ulcerative colitis
      patients with pouchitis, provide the rationale for administering probiotic agents
      in the medical treatment of those conditions. In the maintenance treatment of
      inactive Crohn's disease probiotics, when administered alone, were found
      ineffective in preventing clinical and/or endoscopic recurrence. By contrast, a
      combination of a probiotic agent (eg, Saccharomyces boulardii) with standard
      pharmacological therapy can promote clinical benefit. In patients with pouchitis,
      so far only the probiotic mixture VSL #3 proved to effectively prevent relapses
      after successful antibiotic treatment of active inflammation. Further controlled 
      studies, enrolling higher numbers of patients, are needed to better identify the 
      exact role of probiotics in this area.

LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201500378 [doi]
AB  - SCOPE: Nobiletin (NBT) is a major citrus flavonoid with various health benefits. 
      Herein, we investigated the colon cancer chemopreventive effects of NBT and its
      colonic metabolites in a colitis-associated colon carcinogenesis mouse model as
      well as in human colon cancer cell models. METHODS AND RESULTS: In
      azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium treated mice, oral administration of NBT
      effectively decreased both incidence and multiplicity of colonic tumors. NBT
      showed significant antiproliferative, proapoptotic, and anti-inflammatory effects
      in the mouse colon. HPLC analysis revealed that oral administration of NBT
      resulted in high levels of metabolites, i.e. 3'-demethylnobiletin (M1),
      4'-demethylnobiletin (M2), and 3',4'-didemethylnobiletin (M3) in the colonic
      mucosa. In contrast, the colonic level of NBT was about 20-fold lower than the
      total colonic level of three metabolites. Cell culture studies demonstrated that 
      the colonic metabolites of NBT significantly inhibited the growth of human colon 
      cancer cells, caused cell-cycle arrest, induced apoptosis, and profoundly
      modulated signaling proteins related with cell proliferation and cell death. All 
      of these effects were much stronger than those produced by NBT alone. CONCLUSION:
      Our results demonstrated that oral administration of NBT significantly inhibited 
      colitis-associated colon carcinogenesis in mice, and this chemopreventive effect 
      was strongly associated with its colonic metabolites.

AB  - Probiotics and prebiotics, mainly commercialised as food ingredients and also as 
      supplements, are considered highly profitable niche markets. However, in recent
      years, the food industry has suffered from a series of health claim restrictions 
      on probiotics and prebiotics in many parts of the world, including those made by 
      the European Food Safety Authority. Therefore, we reviewed the core benefits of
      probiotic and prebiotic consumption on health. A number of studies have examined 
      the prevention and/or management of intestinal infections, respiratory tract
      infections, CVD, osteoporosis, urogenital infections, cavities, periodontal
      disease and halitosis, allergic reactions, inflammatory bowel disease and
      irritable bowel syndrome and Helicobacter pylori gastric infections. In fact, a
      deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in human microbiota and immune
      system modulation by probiotics and prebiotics relies on continuous efforts to
      establish suitable biomarkers of health and diseases risk factors for the design 
      of clinical trials required for health claim approval. In spite of the promising 
      results, the performance of large, long-term, well-planned, well-aligned clinical
      studies is crucial to provide more reliability and a more solid basis for the
      outcomes achieved and to support the potential use of probiotics and prebiotics
      in clinical practice.

AB  - Food allergies can result in life-threatening reactions and diminish quality of
      life. The prevalence of food allergies is increasing with large regional
      variability. A few food allergens cover the majority of food-related reactions
      (cow`s milk, egg, wheat, soy, fish, crustacean, nuts and peanut). Food reactions 
      can be categorized in IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated, the latter of which
      remaining often a clue in the diagnosis. Treatment of food allergy involves
      mainly strict avoidance of the trigger food. Medications help to manage symptoms 
      of disease, but currently, there is no cure for food allergy.

PG  - 1653-6
LID - 10.4045/tidsskr.14.1372 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypokalemic pareses are caused by low extracellular potassium levels 
      which reduce the resting membrane potential of muscle cells and make them less
      excitable. It may be caused by an intracellular shift of potassium, renal
      potassium loss, reduced potassium intake or increased gastrointestinal loss. CASE
      PRESENTATION: A woman in her 60s presented with rapid-onset tetraparesis and
      hyporeflexia starting the day before admission. The patient history revealed
      several months of low food intake, increased alcohol consumption and diarrhoea.
      Laboratory tests showed severe hypokalemia (1.5 mmol/l) and hypomagnesemia (0.38 
      mmol/l), and ECG showed atrial fibrillation. She was admitted to the medical
      intensive care unit and treated with intravenous normal saline with added
      potassium and magnesium, with good effect on her symptoms. Urine tests showed
      high potassium-creatinine ratio (4.22 mmol/mmol creatinine) and increased
      fractional excretion of magnesium (18.6%). Abdominal CT scan revealed colonic
      wall thickening, and colonic biopsies showed mild inflammation. Faecal
      calprotectin was moderately elevated (294 mg/kg). INTERPRETATION: The patient had
      hypokalemic pareses for which there were several contributing factors. The renal 
      causes were augmented excretion of magnesium and potassium, probably due to
      increased alcohol consumption. The extrarenal causes were increased
      gastrointestinal loss, with ulcerative colitis being the presumed explanation,
      and reduced food intake.

TI  - Colonization of C57BL/6 Mice by a Potential Probiotic Bifidobacterium bifidum
      Strain under Germ-Free and Specific Pathogen-Free Conditions and during
      Experimental Colitis.
PG  - e0139935
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0139935 [doi]
AB  - The effects of at least some probiotics are restricted to live, metabolically
      active bacteria at their site of action. Colonization of and persistence in the
      gastrointestinal tract is thus contributing to the beneficial effects of these
      strains. In the present study, colonization of an anti-inflammatory
      Bifidobacterium bifidum strain was studied in C57BL/6J mice under germ-free (GF) 
      and specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions as well as during dextran sulfate
      sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. B. bifidum S17/pMGC was unable to stably colonize
      C57BL/6J mice under SPF conditions. Mono-association of GF mice by three doses on
      consecutive days led to long-term, stable detection of up to 109 colony forming
      units (CFU) of B. bifidum S17/pMGC per g feces. This stable population was
      rapidly outcompeted upon transfer of mono-associated animals to SPF conditions. A
      B. animalis strain was isolated from the microbiota of these re-conventionalized 
      mice. This B. animalis strain displayed significantly higher adhesion to murine
      CMT-93 intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) than to human Caco-2 IECs (p = 0.018). 
      Conversely, B. bifidum S17/pMGC, i.e., a strain of human origin, adhered at
      significantly higher levels to human compared to murine IECs (p < 0.001).
      Disturbance of the gut ecology and induction of colitis by DSS-treatment did not 
      promote colonization of the murine gastrointestinal tract (GIT) by B. bifidum
      S17/pMGC. Despite its poor colonization of the mouse GIT, B. bifidum S17/pMGC
      displayed a protective effect on DSS-induced colitis when administered as viable 
      bacteria but not as UV-inactivated preparation. Collectively, these results
      suggest a selective disadvantage of B. bifidum S17/pMGC in the competition with
      the normal murine microbiota and an anti-inflammatory effect that requires live, 
      metabolically active bacteria.

AB  - Crohn's disease is due to the loss of immunological tolerance within the
      gastrointestinal tract to the antigenic array of Mycobacterium avium subspecies
      paratuberculosis (MAP) and closely related polymorphic variants. The loss of
      immune tolerance results in an effector cytokine responsive upon re-exposure to
      MAP. For immune tolerance to MAP to be induced, infection must occur when
      acquired immunity is markedly underdeveloped.

TI  - Probiotic and anti-inflammatory attributes of an isolate Lactobacillus helveticus
      NS8 from Mongolian fermented koumiss.
PG  - 196
LID - 10.1186/s12866-015-0525-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Koumiss is a traditionally fermented mare's milk described with
      health-promoting potentials for decades. However, only a few studies focused on
      the probiotic strains isolated from koumiss. In this study, we collected koumiss 
      samples from Inner Mongolian pasturing area of China and selected a promising
      strain of Lactobacillus helveticus, isolate NS8, based on the survival abilities 
      in gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and adhesion to intestinal endothelial cells in
      vitro. As the ability to positively modulate host immune response is a feature of
      increasing importance in measuring the probiotic potential of a bacterial strain,
      our study mainly focus on the immunomodulatory properties of L. helveticus NS8 by
      using in vivo and ex vivo analyses. RESULTS: L. helveticus NS8 was identified by 
      molecular-typing methods, both at genus and species levels. As a typical food
      niche-specific bacteria, NS8 showed a moderate survival ability in GIT
      environment in vitro. However, an excellent binding capacity to the human
      intestinal epithelial cells, along with significant autoaggregation and
      cell-surface hydrophobicity was observed. Additionally, the presence of S-layer
      protein was responsible for the cell surface properties of this strain. NS8 was
      found to be rather protective against TNBS (2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic
      acid)-induced murine colitis. In the meantime, co-culture with NS8 induced an
      increased level of secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in peripheral
      blood mono-nuclear cells (PBMCs). Furthermore, NS8 was also able to diminish the 
      proinflammatory effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mouse macrophage cell line
      RAW264.7 by inducing higher levels of IL-10. Specially, adding of the purified
      S-layer protein didn't influence the production of IL-10. The specific
      ligand-host receptor interactions on the NS8 specific immune responses need to be
      learned further. CONCLUSION: In summary, L. helveticus NS8 exhibited good
      probiotic and particularly immunomodulatory properties, with a potential for
      development of functional food commercially or therapeutic adjuvant for
      inflammatory diseases.

TI  - Idelalisib-associated Enterocolitis: Clinicopathologic Features and Distinction
      From Other Enterocolitides.
PG  - 1653-60
LID - 10.1097/PAS.0000000000000525 [doi]
AB  - Idelalisib is a highly specific small-molecule phosphoinositide-3-kinase delta
      inhibitor that was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the 
      treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma and
      follicular lymphoma. The known side effects of idelalisib include severe diarrhea
      and colitis. Here we report the histologic findings in idelalisib-associated
      enterocolitis in 11 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or follicular
      lymphoma receiving idelalisib over a 5-year period (2011 to 2015) at our
      institution. All 11 patients were receiving idelalisib and underwent colonoscopy 
      for the evaluation of diarrhea. None of the patients had previously received a
      stem cell transplant. Histologically, the colon biopsies in all 11 cases showed
      some degree of apoptosis within crypts, with 5 cases showing moderate to severe
      apoptosis involving the majority of the crypts with loss of goblet cells. No
      viral inclusions were seen in any case and immunohistochemical stains for
      cytomegalovirus performed in 9/11 cases were negative. All cases showed at least 
      focal acute cryptitis, and 8 of these cases showed mild architectural distortion.
      Increased inflammation within the lamina propria was seen in 7 cases, and
      increased intraepithelial lymphocytes within crypts was seen in 8 cases; the
      lymphocytes were mostly T cells with a predominance of CD8 T cells, with the
      majority expressing the alpha/beta T-cell receptor. Diagnoses of
      graft-versus-host disease, autoimmune enteropathy, infectious enterocolitis, and 
      although thought to be less likely, inflammatory bowel disease were considered in
      each case. The presence of numerous intraepithelial lymphocytes in addition to
      severe villous blunting and apoptosis in the small intestinal biopsies from a
      subset of these patients additionally raised the possibility of autoimmune
      enteropathy, common variable immunodeficiency, or less likely, celiac disease.
      Awareness of the histologic features of idelalisib-associated enterocolitis is
      important to distinguish it from potential mimics, particularly graft-versus-host
      disease, autoimmune enteropathy, and cytomegalovirus/infectious enterocolitis.

TI  - Micronutrient deficiencies in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 576-81
LID - 10.1097/MCO.0000000000000226 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Malnutrition, protein-energy, and micronutrient deficiencies
      are common among patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The deficiencies
      are a manifestation of the complicated disease and a cause of morbidity. The
      present review summarizes recent advances and evidence-based knowledge regarding 
      micronutrients in relation to patients with IBD. RECENT FINDINGS: Micronutrient
      deficiencies occur in more than half of patients with IBD. Most common are
      deficiencies of iron, B12, vitamin D, vitamin K, folic acid, selenium, zinc,
      vitamin B6, and vitamin B1. Deficiencies are more common in Crohn's disease than 
      in ulcerative colitis, and more in active disease than at times of remission.
      Micronutrient deficiency is associated with prolonged and complicated course of
      disease. Iron deficiency is the most common cause for anemia. Definite diagnosis 
      of B12 deficiency cannot be established by serum levels alone. Vitamin D and
      vitamin K deficiencies are thought to be associated with heightened inflammatory 
      state. The relationship of these deficiencies with bone disease is controversial.
      The present review focuses on the significance, epidemiology, treatment options, 
      and recommendations regarding micronutrient deficiencies in IBD. SUMMARY:
      Micronutrient deficiencies are common and have clinical significance. High
      suspicion for micronutrient deficiencies is advocated so that treatable causes of
      morbidity are treated appropriately and late and irreversible sequlae are
      prevented.

TI  - Efficacy of probiotic treatment with Bifidobacterium longum 536 for induction of 
      remission in active ulcerative colitis: A randomized, double-blinded,
      placebo-controlled multicenter trial.
PG  - 67-74
LID - 10.1111/den.12553 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: We conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled
      trial to investigate the efficacy of Bifidobacterium longum 536 (BB536)
      supplementation for induction of remission in Japanese patients with active
      ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Fifty-six patients with mild to moderate UC
      were enrolled. Three patients had pancolitis, 36 had left-sided colitis, and 17
      had proctitis. Patients were randomly treated with 2-3 x 10(11) freeze-dried
      viable BB536 (28 patients) or placebo (28 patients) for 8 weeks. RESULTS: In
      total, 63% of patients receiving BB536 showed clinical remission (UC disease
      activity index [UCDAI] </=2) at week 8 compared to 52% of those receiving placebo
      (P = 0.395). We observed a significant decrease of UCDAI scores (3.8 +/- 0.4 at
      baseline to 2.6 +/- 0.4 at week 8) in the BB536 group (P < 0.01), whereas there
      was no significant decrease in the placebo group (P = 0.88). There was also a
      significant decrease in the Rachmilewitz endoscopic index (EI) and the Mayo
      subscore at week 8 in the BB536 group, whereas there was no significant decrease 
      in the placebo group. A single patient in the BB536 group complained of a mild
      side-effect, but no other adverse effects were observed. CONCLUSION:
      Supplementation with BB536 was well tolerated and reduced UCDAI scores, EI and
      Mayo subscores after 8 weeks in Japanese patients with mild to moderately active 
      UC.

TI  - Case report of gastric outlet obstruction from metastatic lobular breast
      carcinoma.
PG  - 120
LID - 10.1186/s12876-015-0350-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The most common malignancy to cause gastric outlet obstruction is
      primary gastric adenocarcinoma and it is followed by carcinoma of the pancreas
      and gallbladder. Herein, we report a case of gastric outlet obstruction secondary
      to metastatic lobular breast carcinoma. CASE PRESENTATION: Fifty-seven year old
      Caucasian female with recently diagnosed metastatic lobular breast carcinoma to
      skin was referred to gastroenterology for evaluation of dyspepsia and dysphagia. 
      She has past medical history significant for acid reflux and Clostridium
      difficile colitis. Computed tomography of her abdomen showed diffused bowel wall 
      thickening without evidence of bowel obstruction. Due to persistent abdominal
      pain, an upper endoscopy was performed. The upper endoscopy showed gastritis and 
      gastric stenosis in the gastric antrum. These lesions were biopsied and dilated
      with a balloon dilator. The biopsy of the gastric antrum later showed a
      metastatic carcinoma of breast origin with typical tumor morphology and
      immune-phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Differentiating metastatic breast carcinoma from
      primary gastric adenocarcinoma cannot be done using histological examination
      alone. Immunohistochemistry is needed to differentiate the two based on staining 
      for estrogen and progesterone receptors. The presence of gross cystic disease
      fluid protein 15 is also suggestive of metastatic breast carcinoma. The stomach
      has a significant capacity to distend (up to 2-4 L of food) and malignant gastric
      outlet obstruction is often undetected clinically until a high-grade obstruction 
      develops. Our case demonstrates valuable teaching point in terms of broadening
      our differentials for gastric outlet obstruction. When patients present with
      gastric outlet obstruction, both non-malignant and malignant causes of gastric
      outlet obstruction should be considered. Once adenocarcinoma has been determined 
      to be the cause of gastric outlet obstruction, further immunohistochemistry is
      needed to differentiate breast carcinoma from other carcinomas.

TI  - Psychological Factors in Irritable Pouch Syndrome and Other Pouch Disorders.
PG  - 2815-24
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000552 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is the 
      surgical treatment of choice for patients with medically refractory ulcerative
      colitis. Postsurgery, functional and inflammatory complications of the ileal
      pouch often occur. Our previous study demonstrated that irritable pouch syndrome 
      (IPS) is associated with the use of antidepressants or anxiolytics, suggesting an
      influence of psychological factors on patients' symptoms. The aim of this study
      was to identify the specific psychological factors and coping strategies in
      patients with functional (IPS) and inflammatory (pouchitis, cuffitis, Crohn's
      disease of the pouch) pouch disorders. METHODS: Consecutive patients with
      functional pouch disorders (IPS), inflammatory pouch conditions, and asymptomatic
      ileal pouch-anal anastomosis patients were surveyed using validated measures of
      quality of life (the Cleveland Global Quality of Life [CGQL] and Irritable Bowel 
      Syndrome-Quality of Life [IBS-QOL]), daily functional impairment (WSAS), coping
      mechanisms (brief COPE) and anxiety/depression (DASS-21). RESULTS: Of 243
      patients surveyed, 157 (64.6%) completed the surveys, of whom 137 (56.4%) met
      inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. Sixty-one percent of
      respondents had pouch inflammation (pouchitis, N = 35; cuffitis, N = 14; and
      Crohn's disease of the pouch, N = 35), 20% had IPS (N = 27) and 19% (N = 26) had 
      asymptomatic normal pouches. The age of participants ranged from 20 to 79 years
      with the mean ages of patients with normal pouches, IPS and inflammatory pouch
      conditions being 51.7 +/- 12.5, 47.1 +/- 15.0, 47.2 +/- 15.1 years, respectively.
      Patients with IPS were more likely to be taking antidepressants, anxiolytics, or 
      narcotics than the other groups (P < 0.04). Patients with IPS or inflammatory
      pouches had significantly poorer quality of life (CGQL, P < 0.001; IBS-QOL, P <
      0.003) than those with asymptomatic pouches, with differences particularly in the
      areas of food avoidance, activity interference, and sexual difficulties. Those
      with IPS (median = 11; interquartile range [IQR]: 3-19) or inflammatory pouch
      conditions (median = 7; IQR: 3-18) had a greater impairment in the domains of
      daily functioning related to the pouch condition than those with normal pouches
      (median = 1.5; IQR: 0-6; P = 0.003). The mean depression symptom scores were
      significantly higher in the IPS group than in the normal pouch group (11.7 +/-
      9.7 versus 4.4 +/- 6.2; P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: IPS patients were more likely to
      have depressive symptoms and had a greater amount of impairment in daily
      functioning related to their pouch condition. Additionally, patients with
      functional pouch disorders are more likely to be concurrently treated with
      antidepressants, anxiolytic or narcotic agents than those with inflammatory
      pouches or normal pouches.

TI  - Development of interim patient-reported outcome measures for the assessment of
      ulcerative colitis disease activity in clinical trials.
PG  - 1200-10
LID - 10.1111/apt.13408 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) have an increasingly important role 
      in the evaluation of new therapies for inflammatory bowel disease. The US Food
      and Drug Administration has issued formal guidance to describe the role of PRO
      instruments in evaluation of claims for product labelling. However, no validated 
      PRO exists for ulcerative colitis. AIM: To investigate whether the PROs from the 
      Mayo Clinic Score (MCS) for UC can be modified, to develop an interim PRO for use
      in clinical trials, alone or in combination with endoscopy. METHODS: Data from an
      induction trial of a mesalazine (mesalamine) formulation were used to compare
      effect sizes between mesalazine and placebo for PRO items (stool frequency and
      rectal bleeding) alone and in combination with endoscopy. The operating
      properties of the PRO were validated using data from a phase 2 trial of MLN02, a 
      humanised antibody to the alpha4beta7 integrin in patients with UC. RESULTS: A
      two-item PRO (PRO2) consisting of rectal bleeding = 0 and stool frequency </=1 or
      </=2, combined with an endoscopy subscore </=1 yielded statistically significant 
      differences between active drug and placebo. This combination yielded the most
      similar effect sizes and placebo rates for remission, compared to the primary
      trials. Use of PRO items alone yielded high placebo remission rates in both data 
      sets, although rates were lower when the items were combined and remission
      defined as PRO2 = 0. CONCLUSION: Patient-reported outcomes items derived from the
      Mayo Clinic Score combined with endoscopy as a co-primary endpoint may be an
      appropriate interim outcome measure for ulcerative colitis trials.

TI  - Antibacterial Activities of Ankaferd Hemostat (ABS) on Shiga Toxin-Producing
      Escherichia coli and Other Pathogens Significant in Foodborne Diseases.
PG  - 93-98
LID - 10.4274/tjh.2015.0073 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ankaferd hemostat (Ankaferd Blood Stopper(R), ABS)-induced
      pharmacological modulation of essential erythroid proteins can cause vital
      erythroid aggregation via acting on fibrinogen gamma. Topical endoscopic ABS
      application is effective in the controlling of gastrointestinal (GI) system
      hemorrhages and/or infected GI wounds. Escherichia coli O157:H7, the predominant 
      serotype of enterohemorrhagic E. coli, is a cause of both outbreaks and sporadic 
      cases of hemorrhagic colitis. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of 
      ABS on 6 different Shiga toxigenic E. coli serotypes including O26, O103, O104,
      O111, O145, and O157 and on other pathogens significant in foodborne diseases,
      such as Salmonella Typhimurium, Campylobacter jejuni, and Listeria monocytogenes,
      were also assessed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All strains were applied with
      different amounts of ABS and antimicrobial effect was screened. S. Typhimurium
      groups were screened for survival using the fluorescence in situ hybridization
      technique. RESULTS: The relative efficacy of ABS solutions to achieve significant
      logarithmic reduction in foodborne pathogens E. coli O157:H7 and non-O157
      serogroups and other emerging foodborne pathogens is demonstrated in this study. 
      ABS has antibacterial effects. CONCLUSION: Our present study indicated for the
      first time that ABS may act against E. coli O157:H7, which is a cause of
      thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic-uremic syndrome, and hemorrhagic
      colitis. The interrelationships between colitis, infection, and hemostasis within
      the context of ABS application should be further investigated in future studies.

TI  - Toxic epidermal necrolysis caused by acetaminophen featuring almost 100% skin
      detachment: Acetaminophen is associated with a risk of severe cutaneous adverse
      reactions.
PG  - 321-4
LID - 10.1111/1346-8138.13073 [doi]
AB  - Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is an adverse reaction that can be induced by
      various drugs; the associated mortality rate is 20-25%. A previous report showed 
      a weak association between TEN and acetaminophen. Recently, the US Food and Drug 
      Administration declared that acetaminophen is associated with a risk of serious
      skin reactions, including TEN. Here, we describe the case of a 43-year-old
      Japanese woman with TEN caused by acetaminophen. She had poorly controlled
      ulcerative colitis and was treated with high doses of prednisolone, infliximab,
      acetaminophen and lansoprazole. Nine days after administrating acetaminophen,
      targetoid erythematous and bullous lesions appeared on the patient's trunk, palms
      and the soles of her feet. The skin lesions expanded rapidly; within 3 weeks,
      skin detachment was detected across nearly 100% of the patient's body. However,
      no mucosal involvement of the eyes, oral cavity or genitalia was found. We
      performed lymphocyte transformation tests using various drugs; however, a high
      stimulation index was obtained only with acetaminophen. The patient recovered
      following treatment with plasmapheresis, i.v. immunoglobulin therapy, topical
      medication and supportive therapy. Acetaminophen is included in many prescription
      and over-the-counter products; thus, clinicians should monitor their patients for
      severe drug reactions, including TEN.

AB  - Studies suggest that consumption of omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids
      (PUFA) plays a protective role in inflammatory bowel disease; however, the use of
      plant-derived oils rich in alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) has not been widely
      investigated. The aims of this study were to test the effects of two different
      sources of (n-3) PUFA, fish and plant-derived oils, in two animal models of
      experimental colitis and to determine whether the (n-3) PUFA-enriched diets could
      ameliorate the inflammatory status. Rats were fed diets rich in corn, fish or
      sage oil with or without vitamin A supplementation for 3weeks then colitis was
      induced by adding dextran sodium sulfate to the drinking water or by injecting
      2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid. We show that colitic rats fed the sage oil
      diets had a lower inflammatory response, improved histological repair and had
      less necrotic damage in the mucosa when compared to the corn and fish oil groups.
      Colonic damage and myeloperoxidase activity were significantly lower. Colonic
      mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory genes including interleukin IL-6, cyclooxygenase 
      2 and tumor necrosis factor alpha were markedly down-regulated in rats fed fish
      and sage oils compared to control. These results were supported by experiments in
      the human colonic epithelial cell line Caco-2, where ALA supplementation was
      shown to be effective in inhibiting inflammation induced by IL-1beta by
      down-regulating mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory genes including IL-8, COX2 and
      inducible nitric oxide synthase. Taken together, these results suggest that
      plant-derived oil rich in ALA could ameliorate the inflammatory damage in
      colitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The complexity and diversity of the human intestinal microbiome has
      only recently been characterized. The multiple metabolic and immunologic effects 
      of the bacterial flora have demonstrated the symbiosis between the microbiome and
      its host. This symbiosis is disturbed in a multitude of diseases, especially in
      critically ill patients. OBJECTIVES: A review of the changes in the intestinal
      microbiome of critically ill patients and the use of probiotics. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: Nonsystematic literature search in PubMed on the topics: (1) changes in 
      the intestinal microbiome in critically ill patients, (2) interventions using
      probiotics in critically ill patients, and (3) use of fecal transplantation in
      Clostridium difficile colitis. RESULTS: Trauma, sepsis, systemic inflammatory
      response syndrome, and other conditions lead to shifts in the composition of the 
      intestinal microbiome, which are correlated with clinical outcome. The most
      obvious change is a profound loss of obligate anaerobe bacteria, leading also to 
      metabolic changes. Probiotics have been used in several studies and show efficacy
      in the reduction of infectious complication but not in overall mortality. C.
      difficile colitis as the model disease for a disturbed microbiome can be treated 
      effectively by transfer of donor feces, which also restores the diversity of the 
      microbiome. CONCLUSION: Taking into account the successful intervention of fecal 
      transplantation on the intestinal microbiome, new products developed using the
      current knowledge of the intestinal microbiome could be more effective.

TI  - Th17 Cells as Potential Probiotic Therapeutic Targets in Inflammatory Bowel
      Diseases.
PG  - 20841-58
LID - 10.3390/ijms160920841 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are characterized by wasting and chronic
      intestinal inflammation triggered by various cytokine-mediated pathways. In
      recent years, it was shown that T helper 17 (Th17) cells are involved in the
      pathogenesis of IBD, which makes them an attractive therapeutic target. Th17
      cells preferentially produce interleukin (IL)-17A-F as signature cytokines. The
      role of the interplay between host genetics and intestinal microbiota in the
      pathogenesis of IBD was demonstrated. Probiotics are live microorganisms that
      when orally ingested in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit to the host by 
      modulating the enteric flora or by stimulating the local immune system. Several
      studies indicated the effectiveness of probiotics in preventing and treating IBD 
      (ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease). Furthermore, there is mounting
      evidence of probiotics selectively targeting the Th17 lineage in the prevention
      and management of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as IBD. This review
      highlights critical roles of Th17 cells in the pathogenesis of IBD and the
      rationale for using probiotics as a novel therapeutic approach for IBD through
      manipulation of Th17 cells. The potential molecular mechanisms by which
      probiotics modulate Th17 cells differentiation and production are also discussed.

TI  - The Pharmacokinetic Profile of a New Gastroresistant Capsule Preparation of
      Eicosapentaenoic Acid as the Free Fatty Acid.
PG  - 360825
LID - 10.1155/2015/360825 [doi]
AB  - Supplementation with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) may be
      beneficial for patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). In this study we 
      analyzed the pharmacokinetic profile of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), as the free 
      fatty acid (FFA), in an enteric-coated preparation, in 10 ulcerative colitis (UC)
      and 10 Crohn's disease (CD) patients and 15 healthy volunteers (HV). Subjects
      received 2 g daily of EPA-FFA for 8 weeks. Plasma phospholipid and red blood cell
      (RBC) membrane fatty acid content were measured by gas chromatography-mass
      spectrometry. There was a rapid incorporation of EPA into plasma phospholipids by
      2 weeks and a slower, but highly consistent, incorporation into RBC membranes (4%
      total fatty acid content; coefficient of variation 10-16%). There was a
      concomitant reduction in relative n-6 PUFA content. Elongation and desaturation
      of EPA into docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) via docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) were
      apparent and DHA content also increased in membranes. EPA-FFA is well tolerated
      and no difference in the pharmacokinetic profile of n-3 PUFA incorporation was
      detected between IBD patients and HV. Our data support the concept that EPA can
      be considered the "universal donor" with respect to key n-3 PUFAs and that this
      enteric-coated formulation allows long term treatment with a high level of
      compliance.

TI  - The gut microbiota and host health: a new clinical frontier.
PG  - 330-9
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2015-309990 [doi]
AB  - Over the last 10-15 years, our understanding of the composition and functions of 
      the human gut microbiota has increased exponentially. To a large extent, this has
      been due to new 'omic' technologies that have facilitated large-scale analysis of
      the genetic and metabolic profile of this microbial community, revealing it to be
      comparable in influence to a new organ in the body and offering the possibility
      of a new route for therapeutic intervention. Moreover, it might be more accurate 
      to think of it like an immune system: a collection of cells that work in unison
      with the host and that can promote health but sometimes initiate disease. This
      review gives an update on the current knowledge in the area of gut disorders, in 
      particular metabolic syndrome and obesity-related disease, liver disease, IBD and
      colorectal cancer. The potential of manipulating the gut microbiota in these
      disorders is assessed, with an examination of the latest and most relevant
      evidence relating to antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, polyphenols and faecal 
      microbiota transplantation.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory ability of
      novel indigenous probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum MCC 2759, L. fermentum MCC
      2760 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii MCC 2775 in a carrageenan induced acute
      inflammatory paw edema model. Probiotic cultures were administered to male Wistar
      rats via oral route. Carrageenan at a concentration of 1% was injected into hind 
      paw of rats 30min after oral gavage on the 8th day of treatment regimen. Paw
      thickness (mm), stair climbing activity and motility score were the parameters
      used to score the inflammatory response. L. fermentum MCC 2759, L. fermentum MCC 
      2760 and L. delbrueckii MCC 2775 showed significant reduction in paw thickness
      (P<0.05) showing percentage inhibition of 15.67%, 14.72% and 14.84%,
      respectively, 24h after carrageenan induction. Probiotic treatment also markedly 
      alleviated the stair climbing and motility score. Histological analysis of tissue
      sections revealed reduction in cellular infiltration of probiotic and drug
      treatment groups. Adhesion to resected rat intestinal tissue also showed
      significant adherence capability (>40%) of the probiotic cultures used.
      Therefore, L. fermentum MCC 2759, L. fermentum MCC 2760 and L. delbrueckii MCC
      2775 may be used as potent anti-inflammatory agents with probiotic health
      benefits.

TI  - An inflammation-targeting hydrogel for local drug delivery in inflammatory bowel 
      disease.

AB  - There is a clinical need for new, more effective treatments for chronic and
      debilitating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis. Targeting drugs selectively to the inflamed intestine may
      improve therapeutic outcomes and minimize systemic toxicity. We report the
      development of an inflammation-targeting hydrogel (IT-hydrogel) that acts as a
      drug delivery system to the inflamed colon. Hydrogel microfibers were generated
      from ascorbyl palmitate, an amphiphile that is generally recognized as safe
      (GRAS) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. IT-hydrogel microfibers loaded
      with the anti-inflammatory corticosteroid dexamethasone (Dex) were stable,
      released drug only upon enzymatic digestion, and demonstrated preferential
      adhesion to inflamed epithelial surfaces in vitro and in two mouse colitis models
      in vivo. Dex-loaded IT-hydrogel enemas, but not free Dex enemas, administered
      every other day to mice with colitis resulted in a significant reduction in
      inflammation and were associated with lower Dex peak serum concentrations and,
      thus, less systemic drug exposure. Ex vivo analysis of colon tissue samples from 
      patients with ulcerative colitis demonstrated that IT-hydrogel microfibers
      adhered preferentially to mucosa from inflamed lesions compared with
      histologically normal sites. The IT-hydrogel drug delivery platform represents a 
      promising approach for targeted enema-based therapies in patients with colonic
      IBD.

TI  - 6-Gingerol modulates proinflammatory responses in dextran sodium sulfate
      (DSS)-treated Caco-2 cells and experimental colitis in mice through adenosine
      monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation.
PG  - 3334-41
LID - 10.1039/c5fo00513b [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: 6-gingerol has been reported to have anti-inflammatory effects in
      different experimental settings. The present study aimed at evaluating the effect
      of 6-gingerol on dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced barrier impairment and
      inflammation in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: a differentiated Caco-2 monolayer was
      exposed to DSS and treated with different concentrations of 6-gingerol (0, 1, 5, 
      10, 50, and 100 muM). Changes in intestinal barrier function were determined
      using transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). The anti-inflammatory
      activity of 6-gingerol was examined as changes in the expression of
      proinflammatory cytokine using quantitative real-time PCR. Western blotting was
      employed to determine the activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein
      kinase (AMPK). Mice with DSS-induced colitis were given different oral dosages of
      6-gingerol daily for 14 days. Body weight and colon inflammation were evaluated, 
      and level of proinflammatory cytokines in colon tissues was measured. RESULTS:
      6-gingerol treatment was shown to restore impaired intestinal barrier function
      and to suppress proinflammatory responses in DSS-treated Caco-2 monolayers. We
      found that AMPK was activated on 6-gingerol treatment in vitro. In animal
      studies, 6-gingerol significantly ameliorated DSS-induced colitis by restoration 
      of body weight loss, reduction in intestinal bleeding, and prevention of colon
      length shortening. In addition, 6-gingerol suppressed DSS-elevated production of 
      proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, TNFalpha, and IL-12). CONCLUSION: our
      findings highlight the protective effects of 6-gingerol against DSS-induced
      colitis. We concluded that 6-gingerol exerts anti-inflammatory effects through
      AMPK activation. It is suggested that 6-gingerol has a promising role in
      treatment of IBD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of the Punica granatum peel extract on
      symptoms of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). METHOD: Patients with UC were 
      randomized to receive an aqueous extract of the P. granatum peel (6 g of dry
      peel/day) or placebo for four weeks complementary to standard medications.
      Symptoms were assessed using the Lichtiger Colitis Activity Index (LCAI) at
      baseline, week 4, and week 10 (follow-up). Clinical response was defined by >/= 3
      point decrease in LCAI. RESULTS: The LCAI score was similarly reduced in both the
      P. granatum (-1.68 +/- 3.85, P = 0.019) and placebo groups (-1.39 +/- 2.41, P =
      0.002). Clinical response was higher with P. granatum compared with placebo at
      week 4 (41.4% vs. 18.2%, P = 0.055), but not at week 10 (48.3% vs. 36.4%, P =
      0.441). CONCLUSIONS: The P. granatum peel extract seems effective in
      complementary management of UC. Further studies in a larger sample of patients
      are warranted. IRCT2014040617156N1.

PG  - 2311-9
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000501 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diet may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's
      disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC); yet, there are few prospective studies 
      of dietary factors. None have examined the association between adolescent diet
      and risk of inflammatory bowel diseases (CD and UC). METHODS: This study included
      women enrolled in Nurses' Health Study II who completed a validated high school
      dietary questionnaire in 1998. We examined the effect of dietary patterns
      (prudent or Western diet) and individual components of each patterns. We
      documented incident cases of CD and UC through 2011 based on physician review of 
      medical records and used Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for
      confounders to estimate hazard ratios and confidence intervals for CD and UC.
      RESULTS: Over 763,229 person-years of follow-up, we identified 70 incident cases 
      of CD and 103 cases of UC. Compared with women in the lowest quartile of a
      prudent diet score (characterized by greater intake of fruits, vegetables, and
      fish), women in the highest quartile had a 53% lower risk of CD (hazard ratio,
      0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.23-0.98; P trend = 0.04). Specifically, greater 
      intake of fish (P trend = 0.01) and fiber (P trend = 0.06) were associated with
      lower risk of CD. In contrast, Western diet score was not associated with risk of
      CD. Neither dietary patterns nor individual food or nutrient groups was
      associated with UC. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent diet is associated with risk of CD,
      but not UC, offering insights into disease pathogenesis.

AB  - Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease (EGID) can be classified as eosinophilic
      esophagitis (EoE) when the eosinophilia is limited to the esophagus or as
      eosinophilic gastritis (EG) if it is limited to the gastric tract, eosinophilic
      colitis (EC) if it is limited to the colon, and eosinophilic gastroenteritis
      (EGE) if the eosinophilia involves one or more parts of the gastrointestinal
      tract. EoE is by far the most common EGID. It is a well-defined chronic atopic
      disease due to a T helper type 2 (Th2) inflammation triggered often by food
      allergens. EoE diagnosis is done if an esophageal biopsy shows at least 15
      eosinophils per high power field (eos/hpf). Globally accepted long-term therapies
      for EoE are the use of swallowed inhaled steroids or food antigen avoidance. The 
      treatment of EoE is done not only to control symptoms but also to prevent
      complications such as esophageal stricture and food impaction. EGE cause
      non-specific gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and are diagnosed if
      esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)/colonoscopy show eosinophilia in one or more
      parts of the GI tract. They are rare diseases with an unclear pathogenesis, and
      they are poorly defined in terms of diagnostic criteria and treatment. Before
      initiating treatment of any EGE, it is imperative to conduct a differential
      diagnosis to exclude other causes of hypereosinophilia with GI localization. EGE 
      are often poorly responsive to therapy and there is no commonly accepted
      long-term treatment. EG has many characteristics similar to EoE, including the
      fact that it is often due to a food allergen-driven Th2 inflammation;
      transcriptome analysis however shows that it is more a systemic disease and has a
      different gene signature than EoE. EC is a benign form of delayed food allergy in
      infant and is instead a difficult-to-treat severe inflammatory condition in older
      children and adults. EC in the latter groups can be a manifestation of drug
      allergy or autoimmune disease. Overall EGE, EC, and EG are rare and are a
      diagnosis of exclusion until more common causes of eosinophilia have been
      excluded.

AB  - Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) cause hemorrhagic colitis (HC) and 
      hemolytic-uremic syndrome in humans (HUS). Cattle are the main reservoir of STEC 
      and transmission to humans occurs through contaminated food and water.
      Antibiotics are used in pig production systems to combat disease and improve
      productivity and play a key role in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance
      genes to the bacteria. Integrons have been identified in resistant bacteria
      allowing for the acquisition and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes.
      STEC strains isolated from humans and animals have developed antibiotic
      resistance. In our laboratory, 21 non-157 STEC strains isolated from pigs were
      analyzed to detect class 1 and 2 integrons by PCR. Eight carried integrons, 7 of 
      them harbored intl2. In another study 545 STEC strains were also analyzed for the
      presence of intl1 and intl2 . Strains carrying intl1 belonged to isolates from
      environment (n = 1), chicken hamburger (n = 2), dairy calves (n = 4) and pigs (n 
      = 8). Two strains isolated from pigs harbored intl2 and only one intl1 / intl2 , 
      highlighting the presence of intl2 in pigs. The selection for multiresistant
      strains may contribute to the emergence of antibiotic resistant pathogens and
      facilitate the spreading of the mobile resistance elements to other bacteria.

TI  - Dietary intake of inulin-type fructans in active and inactive Crohn's disease and
      healthy controls: a case-control study.
PG  - 1024-31
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv136 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Prebiotic inulin-type fructans are widely consumed in the
      diet and may have contrasting effects in Crohn's disease by stimulating gut
      microbiota and/or by generating functional gastrointestinal symptoms. The aim of 
      this study was to measure fructan and oligofructose intakes in patients with
      active and inactive Crohn's disease compared with healthy controls. METHODS:
      Patients with active Crohn's disease (n = 98), inactive Crohn's (n = 99) and
      healthy controls (n = 106) were recruited to a case-control study. Dietary intake
      of inulin-type fructans was measured using a specific food frequency
      questionnaire and was compared between the three groups and between patients with
      different disease phenotypes (Montreal classification). Associations between
      intakes and disease activity (Harvey-Bradshaw Index, HBI) were also undertaken.
      RESULTS: Patients with active Crohn's disease had lower fructan intakes (median
      2.9 g/d, interquartile range [IQR] 1.8) than those with inactive Crohn's (3.6
      g/d, 2.1, p = 0.036) or controls (3.9 g/d, 2.1, p = 0.003) and lower
      oligofructose intakes (2.8 g/d, 1.8) than those with inactive Crohn's (3.5 g/d,
      2.2, p = 0.048) or controls (3.8 g/d, 2.1, p = 0.003). There were no differences 
      in intakes related to disease site or behaviour. There were negative correlations
      between HBI well-being score and fructan intake (rho = -0.154, p = 0.03) and
      oligofructose intake (rho = -0.156, p = 0.028) and for the HBI abdominal pain
      score and fructan (rho = -0.164, p = 0.021) and oligofructose intake (rho =
      -0.157, p = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with active Crohn's disease consume
      lower quantities of fructans and oligofructose than their inactive counterparts
      and healthy controls. The impact of lower intakes of prebiotic fructans on gut
      microbiota is unknown and warrants further research.

TI  - Bifidobacterium longum CCM 7952 Promotes Epithelial Barrier Function and Prevents
      Acute DSS-Induced Colitis in Strictly Strain-Specific Manner.
PG  - e0134050
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0134050 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reduced microbial diversity has been associated with inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) and probiotic bacteria have been proposed for its prevention 
      and/or treatment. Nevertheless, comparative studies of strains of the same
      subspecies for specific health benefits are scarce. Here we compared two
      Bifidobacterium longum ssp. longum strains for their capacity to prevent
      experimental colitis. METHODS: Immunomodulatory properties of nine probiotic
      bifidobacteria were assessed by stimulation of murine splenocytes. The immune
      responses to B. longum ssp. longum CCM 7952 (Bl 7952) and CCDM 372 (Bl 372) were 
      further characterized by stimulation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cell,
      HEK293/TLR2 or HEK293/NOD2 cells. A mouse model of dextran sulphate sodium
      (DSS)-induced colitis was used to compare their beneficial effects in vivo.
      RESULTS: The nine bifidobacteria exhibited strain-specific abilities to induce
      cytokine production. Bl 372 induced higher levels of both pro- and
      anti-inflammatory cytokines in spleen and dendritic cell cultures compared to Bl 
      7952. Both strains engaged TLR2 and contain ligands for NOD2. In a mouse model of
      DSS-induced colitis, Bl 7952, but not Bl 372, reduced clinical symptoms and
      preserved expression of tight junction proteins. Importantly, Bl 7952 improved
      intestinal barrier function as demonstrated by reduced FITC-dextran levels in
      serum. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that Bl 7952, but not Bl 372, protected mice
      from the development of experimental colitis. Our data suggest that although some
      immunomodulatory properties might be widespread among the genus Bifidobacterium, 
      others may be rare and characteristic only for a specific strain. Therefore,
      careful selection might be crucial in providing beneficial outcome in clinical
      trials with probiotics in IBD.

TI  - Ergosterol peroxide from Chaga mushroom (Inonotus obliquus) exhibits anti-cancer 
      activity by down-regulation of the beta-catenin pathway in colorectal cancer.
PG  - 303-12
LID - 10.1016/j.jep.2015.07.030 [doi]
LID - S0378-8741(15)30047-7 [pii]
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: In this study, we examined the effect of different fractions
      and components of Chaga mushroom (Inonotus Obliquus) on viability and apoptosis
      of colon cancer cells. Among them, one component showed the most effective growth
      inhibition and was identified as ergosterol peroxide by NMR analysis. We
      investigated the anti-proliferative and apoptosis mechanisms of ergosterol
      peroxide associated with its anti-cancer activities in human colorectal cancer
      (CRC) cell lines and tested its anti-tumor effect on colitis-induced CRC
      developed by Azoxymethane (AOM)/Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in a mouse model.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used MTT
      (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assays, flow
      cytometry assays, Western blot analysis, colony formation assays, reverse
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and
      AOM/DSS mouse models to study the molecular mechanism of metastatic activities in
      CRC cells. RESULTS: Ergosterol peroxide inhibited cell proliferation and also
      suppressed clonogenic colony formation in HCT116, HT-29, SW620 and DLD-1 CRC cell
      lines. The growth inhibition observed in these CRC cell lines was the result of
      apoptosis, which was confirmed by FACS analysis and Western blotting. Ergosterol 
      peroxide inhibited the nuclear levels of beta-catenin, which ultimately resulted 
      in reduced transcription of c-Myc, cyclin D1, and CDK-8. Ergosterol peroxide
      administration showed a tendency to suppress tumor growth in the colon of
      AOM/DSS-treated mice, and quantification of the IHC staining showed a dramatic
      decrease in the Ki67-positive staining and an increase in the TUNEL staining of
      colonic epithelial cells in AOM/DSS-treated mice by ergosterol peroxide for both 
      prevention and therapy. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that ergosterol peroxide
      suppresses the proliferation of CRC cell lines and effectively inhibits
      colitis-associated colon cancer in AOM/DSS-treated mice. Ergosterol peroxide
      down-regulated beta-catenin signaling, which exerted anti-proliferative and
      pro-apoptotic activities in CRC cells. These properties of ergosterol peroxide
      advocate its use as a supplement in colon cancer chemoprevention.

AB  - Pouchitis is the most frequent long-term complication of pouch surgery for
      ulcerative colitis. There is consistent evidence on the implication of bacterial 
      flora in the pathogenesis of pouchitis, and there is evidence for a therapeutic
      role of antibiotics and probiotics in therapy of this disease. Antibiotics,
      particularly ciprofloxacin and metronidazole, are the mainstay of treatment for
      acute pouchitis. In chronic refractory pouchitis, after having excluded other
      diagnoses (infections, Crohn's disease of the pouch, ischemia and irritable
      pouch), antibiotic combination therapy is the treatment of choice. The highly
      concentrated probiotic mixture VSL#3 has been shown to be effective in prevention
      of pouchitis onset and in maintaining antibiotic-induced remission.

TI  - Ocotillol, a Majonoside R2 Metabolite, Ameliorates 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic 
      Acid-Induced Colitis in Mice by Restoring the Balance of Th17/Treg Cells.
PG  - 7024-31
LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.5b02183 [doi]
AB  - In a preliminary experiment, majonoside R2 (MR2), isolated from Vietnamese
      ginseng (Panax vietnamensis Ha et Grushv.), inhibited differentiation to Th17
      cells and was metabolized to ocotillol via pseudoginsenoside RT4 (PRT4) by gut
      microbiota. Therefore, we examined the inhibitory effects of MR2 and its
      metabolites PRT4 and ocotillol against Th17 cell differentiation. These
      ginsenosides significantly suppressed interleukin (IL)-6/tumor growth factor
      beta-induced differentiation of splenic CD4(+) T cells into Th17 cells and
      expression of IL-17 in vitro. Among these ginsenosides, ocotillol showed the
      highest inhibitory effect. We also examined the anti-inflammatory effect of
      ocotillol in mice with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis.
      Oral administration of ocotillol significantly suppressed TNBS-induced colon
      shortening, macroscopic score, myeloperoxidase activity, and production of nitric
      oxide and prostaglandin E2. Ocotillol treatment increased TNBS-suppressed
      expression of tight junction proteins ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1 in the colon.
      Treatment with ocotillol inhibited TNBS-induced expression of tumor necrosis
      factor (TNF)-alpha and IL-1beta, as well as activation of NF-kappaB and MAPKs.
      Moreover, treatment with ocotillol inhibited TNBS- induced differentiation to
      Th17 cells in the lamina propria of colon, as well as expression of T-bet,
      RORgammat, IL-17, and IL-23. Ocotillol treatment also increased Treg cell
      differentiation and Foxp3 and IL-10 expression. These findings suggest that
      orally administered MR2 may be metabolized to ocotillol in the intestine by gut
      microbiota and the transformed ocotillol may ameliorate inflammatory diseases
      such as colitis by restoring the balance of Th17/Treg cells.

TI  - Oral administration of geraniol ameliorates acute experimental murine colitis by 
      inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines and NF-kappaB signaling.
PG  - 2984-95
LID - 10.1039/c5fo00405e [doi]
AB  - Ulcerative colitis is associated with a considerable reduction in the quality of 
      life of patients. The use of phyto-ingredients is becoming an increasingly
      attractive approach for the management of colitis. Geraniol is a monoterpene with
      anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties. In this study, we investigated
      the therapeutic potential of geraniol as a complementary and alternative medicine
      against dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis in mice. Disease
      activity indices (DAI) comprising body weight loss, presence of occult blood and 
      stool consistency were assessed for evaluation of colitis symptoms. Intestinal
      damage was assessed by evaluating colon length and its histology. Pre-treatment
      with geraniol significantly reduced the DAI score, improved stool consistency
      (without occult blood) and increased the colon length. The amount of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, specifically TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 and the
      activity of myeloperoxidase in colon tissue were significantly decreased in
      geraniol pre-treated mice. Western blot analyses revealed that geraniol
      interfered with NF-kappaB signaling by inhibiting NF-kappaB (p65)-DNA binding,
      and IkappaBalpha phosphorylation, degradation and subsequent increase in nuclear 
      translocation. Moreover, the expressions of downstream target pro-inflammatory
      enzymes such as iNOS and COX-2 were significantly reduced by geraniol.
      Pre-treatment with geraniol also restored the DSS-induced decline in antioxidant 
      parameters such as reduced glutathione and superoxide dismutase activity and
      attenuated the increase in lipid peroxidation marker, thiobarbituric acid
      reactive substances and nitrative stress marker, nitrites in colon tissue. Thus, 
      our results suggest that geraniol is a potential therapeutic agent for
      inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Fragments of Citrullinated and MMP-degraded Vimentin and MMP-degraded Type III
      Collagen Are Novel Serological Biomarkers to Differentiate Crohn's Disease from
      Ulcerative Colitis.
PG  - 863-72
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv123 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A hallmark of inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] is chronic
      inflammation, which leads to excessive extracellular matrix [ECM] remodelling and
      release of specific protein fragments, called neoepitopes. We speculated that the
      biomarker profile panel for ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn's disease [CD]
      represent a heterogeneous expression pattern, and may be applied as a tool to aid
      in the differentiation between UC and CD. METHODS: Serum biomarkers of degraded
      collagens I, III-IV [C1M, C3M, and C4M], collagen type 1 and IV formation [P1NP, 
      P4NP], and citrullinated and MMP-degraded vimentin [VICM] were studied with a
      competitive ELISA assay system in a cohort including 164 subjects [CD n = 72, UC 
      n = 60, and non-IBD controls n = 32] and a validation cohort of 61 subjects [CD n
      = 46, and UC n = 15]. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and
      logistic regression modelling were carried out to evaluate the discriminative
      power of the biomarkers. RESULTS: All biomarkers were corrected for confounding
      factors. VICM and C3M demonstrated the highest diagnostic power, alone, to
      differentiate CD from UC with an area under the curve [AUC] of 0.77 and 0.69,
      respectively. Furthermore, the biomarkers C1M [AUC = 0.81], C3M [AUC = 0.83],
      VICM [AUC = 0.83], and P1NP [AUC = 0.77] were best to differentiate UC from
      non-IBD. The best combinations of biomarkers to differentiate CD from UC and UC
      from non-IBD were VICM, C3M, C4M [AUC = 0.90] and VICM, C3M [AUC = 0.98]
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Specific extracellular matrix degradation markers are 
      elevated in IBD and can discriminate CD from UC and UC from non-IBD controls with
      a high diagnostic accuracy.

LID - 10.1007/s11882-015-0546-9 [doi]
AB  - Food protein-induced enterocolitis (FPIES), allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP), and
      enteropathy (FPE) are among a number of immune-mediated reactions to food that
      are thought to occur primarily via non-IgE-mediated pathways. All three are
      typically present in infancy and are triggered most commonly by cow's milk
      protein. The usual presenting features are vomiting with lethargy and dehydration
      in FPIES; bloody and mucous stools in FPIAP; and diarrhea with malabsorption and 
      failure to thrive in FPE. Diagnosis is based on convincing history and resolution
      of symptoms with food avoidance; confirmatory diagnostic testing other than food 
      challenge is lacking. The mainstay of management is avoidance of the suspected
      inciting food, with interval challenge to assess for resolution, which usually
      occurs in the first years of life. Studies published in the past few years
      clarify common presenting features, report additional culprit foods, address
      potential biomarkers, and suggest new management strategies.

TI  - Vitamin D receptor pathway is required for probiotic protection in colitis.
PG  - G341-9
LID - 10.1152/ajpgi.00105.2015 [doi]
AB  - Low expression of vitamin D receptor (VDR) and dysfunction of vitamin D/VDR
      signaling are reported in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD);
      therefore, restoration of VDR function to control inflammation in IBD is
      desirable. Probiotics have been used in the treatment of IBD. However, the role
      of probiotics in the modulation of VDR signaling to effectively reduce
      inflammation is unknown. We identified a novel role of probiotics in activating
      VDR activity, thus inhibiting inflammation, using cell models and VDR knockout
      mice. We found that the probiotics Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG (LGG) and
      Lactobacillus plantarum (LP) increased VDR protein expression in both mouse and
      human intestinal epithelial cells. Using the VDR luciferase reporter vector, we
      detected increased transcriptional activity of VDR after probiotic treatment.
      Probiotics increased the expression of the VDR target genes, such as
      antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin, at the transcriptional level. Furthermore,
      the role of probiotics in regulating VDR signaling was tested in vivo using a
      Salmonella-colitis model in VDR knockout mice. Probiotic treatment conferred
      physiological and histologic protection from Salmonella-induced colitis in
      VDR(+/+) mice, whereas probiotics had no effects in the VDR(-/-) mice. Probiotic 
      treatment also enhanced numbers of Paneth cells, which secrete AMPs for host
      defense. These data indicate that the VDR pathway is required for probiotic
      protection in colitis. Understanding how probiotics enhance VDR signaling and
      inhibit inflammation will allow probiotics to be used effectively, resulting in
      innovative approaches to the prevention and treatment of chronic inflammation.

TI  - Evolution of nonspecific duodenal lymphocytosis over 2 years of follow-up.
PG  - 7545-52
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v21.i24.7545 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To assess the evolution of duodenal lymphocytosis (DL), a condition
      characterized by increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), over 2 years of
      follow-up. METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing upper endoscopy/histology for
      abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, weakness or other extraintestinal features
      compatible with celiac disease (CD) were included. Evaluation of IELs infiltrate 
      in duodenal biopsy samples was carried out by CD3-immunohistochemistry and
      expressed as number of positive cells/100 enterocytes. Diagnostic agreement on
      the IELs count was tested by calculating the weighted k coefficient. All patients
      underwent serological detection of autoantibodies associated with CD: IgG and IgA
      anti-tissue transglutaminase and endomysium. Each patient underwent further
      investigations to clarify the origin of DL at baseline and/or in the course of 2 
      years of follow-up every six months. Autoimmune thyroiditis, intestinal
      infections, parasitic diseases, bacterial intestinal overgrowth, hypolactasia and
      wheat allergy were detected. Colonoscopy and enteric magnetic resonance imaging
      were performed when necessary. Risk factors affecting the final diagnosis were
      detected by multinomial logistic regression and expressed as OR. RESULTS:
      Eighty-five patients (16 males, 69 females, aged 34.1 +/- 12.5 years) were
      followed up for a mean period of 21.7 +/- 11.7 mo. At baseline,
      endoscopy/duodenal biopsy, CD3 immunohistochemistry revealed: > 25 IELs/100
      enterocytes in 22 subjects, 15-25 IELs in 37 and < 15 IELs in 26. They all had
      negative serum anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysium, whilst 5 showed IgG
      anti-gliadin positivity. In the course of follow-up, 23 developed CD
      seropositivity and gluten sensitivity (GS) was identified in 19. Other diagnoses 
      were: 5 Helicobacter pylori infections, 4 jejunal Crohn's disease, 1 lymphocytic 
      colitis and 1 systemic sclerosis. The disease in the remaining 32 patients was
      classified as irritable bowel syndrome because of the lack of diagnostic
      evidence. At multivariate analysis, the evolution towards CD was associated with 
      an IELs infiltrate > 25 (OR = 1640.4) or 15-25 (OR = 16.95), human leukocyte
      antigen (HLA) DQ2/8 (OR = 140.85) or DQA1*0501 (OR = 15.36), diarrhea (OR = 5.56)
      and weakness (OR = 11.57). GS was associated with IELs 15-25 (OR = 28.59),
      autoimmune thyroiditis (OR = 87.63), folate deficiency (OR = 48.53) and diarrhea 
      (OR = 54.87). CONCLUSION: DL may have a multifactorial origin but the IELs
      infiltrate and HLA are strong predictive factors for CD development and a
      clinical diagnosis of GS.

AB  - Several epidemiological investigations have been conducted to evaluate the
      relationship between dietary fiber intake and inflammatory bowel diseases, but
      the results are inconsistent. This meta-analysis was performed to quantitatively 
      summarize the evidence from observational studies. PubMed, Embase, and Web of
      Knowledge were searched for relevant articles published up to November 2014. The 
      combined relative risks were calculated with the fixed- or random-effects model. 
      Dose-response relationship was assessed using restricted cubic spline model. We
      hypothesized that the meta-analysis could yield a summary effect, which would
      indicate that dietary fiber intake could decrease the risk of ulcerative colitis 
      and Crohn disease (CD). Overall, 8 articles involving 2 cohort studies, 1 nested 
      case-control study, and 5 case-control studies were finally included in this
      study. The pooled relative risks with 95% confidence intervals of ulcerative
      colitis and CD for the highest vs lowest categories of dietary fiber intake were 
      0.80 (0.64-1.00) and 0.44 (0.29-0.69), respectively. A linear dose-response
      relationship was found between dietary fiber and CD risk, and the risk of CD
      decreased by 13% (P < .05) for every 10 g/d increment in fiber intake. The
      results from this meta-analysis indicated that the intake of dietary fiber was
      significantly associated with a decreased risk of inflammatory bowel disease.

LID - 10.1074/jbc.M115.653584 [doi]
AB  - Prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins (PHDs) control cellular adaptation to hypoxia.
      PHDs are found involved in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, the exact
      role of PHD3, a member of the PHD family, in IBD remains unknown. We show here
      that PHD3 plays a critical role in maintaining intestinal epithelial barrier
      function. We found that genetic ablation of Phd3 in intestinal epithelial cells
      led to spontaneous colitis in mice. Deletion of PHD3 decreases the level of tight
      junction protein occludin, leading to a failure of intestinal epithelial barrier 
      function. Further studies indicate that PHD3 stabilizes occludin by preventing
      the interaction between the E3 ligase Itch and occludin, in a
      hydroxylase-independent manner. Examination of biopsy of human ulcerative colitis
      patients indicates that PHD3 is decreased with disease severity, indicating that 
      PHD3 down-regulation is associated with progression of this disease. We show that
      PHD3 protects intestinal epithelial barrier function and reveal a
      hydroxylase-independent function of PHD3 in stabilizing occludin. These findings 
      may help open avenues for developing a therapeutic strategy for IBD.

TI  - DYSMICROBISM, INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE AND THYROIDITIS: ANALYSIS OF THE
      LITERATURE.
PG  - 265-72
AB  - The human body is colonized by a large number of microbes that are collectively
      referred to as the microbiota. They interact with the hosting organism and some
      do contribute to the physiological maintenance of the general good health thru
      regulation of some metabolic processes while some others are essential for the
      synthesis of vitamins and short-chain fatty acids. The abnormal variation, in the
      quality and/or quantity of individual bacterial species residing in the
      gastro-intestinal tract, is called dysmicrobism. The immune system of the host
      will respond to these changes at the intestinal mucosa level which could lead to 
      Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD). This inflammatory immune response could
      subsequently extend to other organs and systems outside the digestive tract such 
      as the thyroid, culminating in thyroiditis. The goal of the present study is to
      review and analyze data reported in the literature about thyroiditis associated
      with inflammatory bowel diseases such as Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohns
      Disease (CD). It was reported that similarities of some molecular bacterial
      components with molecular components of the host are considered among the factors
      causing IBD through an autoimmune reaction which could involve other non-immune
      cell types. The axis dysmicrobism-IBD-autoimmune reaction will be investigated as
      a possible etiopathogenic mechanism to Autoimmune Thyroiditis. If such is the
      case, then the employment of specific probiotic strains may represent a useful
      approach to moderate the immune system.

AB  - Ipilimumab, an antibody that blocks cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4
      (CTLA-4; CD152), was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011 for the
      treatment of unresectable stage III or IV malignant melanoma. Although the
      addition of this particular immunotherapy has broadened treatment options,
      immune-related adverse events (irAEs) are associated with ipilimumab therapy,
      including dermatologic effects, colitis and diarrhea, endocrine effects,
      hepatotoxicity, ocular effects, renal effects, neurologic effects, and others. In
      this article, a critical evaluation of the underlying mechanisms of irAEs
      associated with anti-CTLA-4 therapy is presented. Additionally, potentially
      beneficial effects of combinational therapies to alleviate ipilimumab-induced
      irAEs in malignant melanoma are discussed. Future research is warranted to
      elucidate the efficacy of such combination therapies and specific biomarkers that
      would help to predict a clinical response to ipilimumab in patients with
      malignant melanoma.

TI  - Wild jujube polysaccharides protect against experimental inflammatory bowel
      disease by enabling enhanced intestinal barrier function.
PG  - 2568-77
LID - 10.1039/c5fo00378d [doi]
AB  - Dietary polysaccharides provide various beneficial effects for our health. We
      investigated the protective effects of wild jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill. var.
      spinosa (Bunge) Hu ex H. F. Chou) sarcocarp polysaccharides (WJPs) against
      experimental inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by enabling enhanced intestinal
      barrier function. Colitis was induced in rats by the intrarectal administration
      of TNBS. We found that WJPs markedly ameliorated the colitis severity, including 
      less weight loss, decreased disease activity index scores, and improved mucosal
      damage in colitis rats. Moreover, WJPs suppressed the inflammatory response via
      attenuation of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 and MPO activity in colitis rats. And
      then, to determine the effect of WJPs on the intestinal barrier, we measured the 
      effect of WJPs on the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and
      FITC-conjugated dextran permeability in Caco-2 cell stimulation with TNF-alpha.
      We further demonstrated that the alleviation of WJPs to colon injury was
      associated with barrier function by assembly of tight junction proteins.
      Moreover, the effect of WJPs on TER was eliminated by the specific inhibitor of
      AMPK. AMPK activity was also up-regulated by WJPs in Caco-2 cell stimulation with
      TNF-alpha and in colitis rats. This study demonstrates that WJPs protect against 
      IBD by enabling enhanced intestinal barrier function involving the activation of 
      AMPK.

PG  - 489821
LID - 10.1155/2015/489821 [doi]
AB  - The gut is able to maintain tolerance to microbial and food antigens. The
      intestine minimizes the number of harmful bacteria by shaping the microbiota
      through a symbiotic relationship. In healthy human intestine, a constant
      homeostasis is maintained by the perfect regulation of microbial load and the
      immune response generated against it. Failure of this balance may result in
      various pathological conditions. Innate immune sensors, such as Toll-like
      receptors (TLRs), may be considered an interface among intestinal epithelial
      barrier, microbiota, and immune system. TLRs pathway, activated by pathogens, is 
      involved in the pathogenesis of several infectious and inflammatory diseases. The
      alteration of the homeostasis between physiologic and pathogenic bacteria of
      intestinal flora causes a condition called dysbiosis. The breakdown of
      homeostasis by dysbiosis may increase susceptibility to inflammatory bowel
      diseases. It is evident that environment, genetics, and host immunity form a
      highly interactive regulatory triad that controls TLR function. Imbalanced
      relationships within this triad may promote aberrant TLR signaling, critically
      contributing to acute and chronic intestinal inflammatory processes, such as in
      IBD, colitis, and colorectal cancer. The study of interactions between different 
      components of the immune systems and intestinal microbiota will open new horizons
      in the knowledge of gut inflammation.

TI  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli infection has donor-dependent effect on human 
      gut microbiota and may be antagonized by probiotic yeast during interaction with 
      Peyer's patches.
PG  - 9097-110
LID - 10.1007/s00253-015-6704-0 [doi]
AB  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) are major food-borne pathogens
      responsible for serious infections ranging from mild diarrhea to hemorrhagic
      colitis and life-threatening complications. Shiga toxins (Stxs) are the main
      virulence factor of EHEC. The antagonistic effect of a prophylactic treatment
      with the probiotic strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae against EHEC O157:H7 was
      investigated using complementary in vitro human colonic model and in vivo murine 
      ileal loop assays. In vitro, the probiotic treatment had no effect on O157:H7
      survival but favorably influenced gut microbiota activity through modulation of
      short-chain fatty acid production, increasing acetate production and decreasing
      that of butyrate. Both pathogen and probiotic strains had individual-dependent
      effects on human gut microbiota. For the first time, stx expression was followed 
      in human colonic environment: at 9 and 12 h post EHEC infection, probiotic
      treatment significantly decreased stx mRNA levels. Besides, in murine ileal
      loops, the probiotic yeast specifically exerted a trophic effect on intestinal
      mucosa and inhibited O157:H7 interactions with Peyer's patches and subsequent
      hemorrhagic lesions. Taken together, the results suggest that S. cerevisiae may
      be useful in the fight against EHEC infection and that host associated factors
      such as microbiota could influence clinical evolution of EHEC infection and the
      effectiveness of probiotics.

TI  - The Anti-atherosclerotic Dipeptide, Trp-His, Reduces Intestinal Inflammation
      through the Blockade of L-Type Ca2+ Channels.
PG  - 6041-50
LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.5b01682 [doi]
AB  - Trp-His, the anti-atherosclerotic dipeptide, exerted an antiproliferative effect 
      on vascular smooth muscle cells by L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker-like effect. The
      beneficial potential by the blockade of Ca(2+) channels on chronic intestinal
      inflammation, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), is unclear. Trp-His
      (100 or 250 mg/kg body weight/day) was administered for 14 days to BALB/c mice,
      and 5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) was administered to induce colitis in the
      last 7 days. Trp-His reduced DSS-induced typical colitis symptoms and cytokine
      expression in the colon. Trp-His inhibited interleukin (IL)-8 secretion in tumor 
      necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-stimulated HT-29 cells. The inhibitory effect of
      Trp-His, as well as that of Ca(2+) channel blockers, was impaired by the presence
      of Ca(2+) channel agonist Bay K 8644. The TNF-alpha-induced activation of
      mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and IkappaBalpha were decreased by
      Trp-His. These results indicated that the anti-inflammatory effect of Trp-His may
      be involved in the blockade of L-type Ca(2+) channels.

TI  - Association of STAT4 rs7574865 polymorphism with susceptibility to inflammatory
      bowel disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 627-36

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Association of Signal transducers and activators of transcription-4
      (STAT4) gene polymorphism with susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease have 
      been investigated in a number of epidemiological studies, but the results are
      inclusive. The aim of this meta-analysis was to more precisely estimate the
      relationship. METHODS: The databases of Pubmed and CBM updated to October, 2014
      were retrieved. Random- or fixed-effect model was used to estimate odd radio (OR)
      and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95%CI) on the basis of heterogeneity. 
      RESULTS: Seven articles containing 2196 Crohn's disease (CD) cases, 1588
      ulcerative colitis (UC) cases and 4126 controls were identified. We detected a
      significant association between STAT4 rs7574865 polymorphism and IBD
      susceptibility in overall population (GG vs. GT+TT, OR=0.855, 95% CI=0.760-0.962,
      P=0.009), but not in Caucasian and Asian population, respectively. No association
      was detected between rs7574865 polymorphism and CD susceptibility in overall,
      Asian and Caucasian population, respectively. Interestingly, a significant
      association was detected between rs7574865 with UC susceptibility in overall
      population (G vs. T, OR=0.881, 95% CI=0.798-0.972, P=0.012; GG vs. GT+TT,
      OR=0.788, 95% CI=0.679-0.914, P=0.002; GG vs. TT, OR=0.683, 95% CI=0.498-0.937,
      P=0.018) and Caucasians (GG vs. GT+TT, OR=0.833, 95% CI=0.701-0.990, P=0.038;
      GG+GT vs. TT, OR=0.667, 95% CI=0.456-0.975, P=0.037; GG vs. TT, OR=0.636, 95%
      CI=0.433-0.934, P=0.021), respectively, and a possible association was found in
      Asian population (GG vs. GT+TT, OR=0.709, 95% CI=0.503-0.998, P=0.049).
      CONCLUSIONS: STAT4 rs7574865 gene is IBD risk factor, and this gene polymorphism 
      is associated with UC susceptibility, especially in Caucasians. To confirm these 
      findings, further studies with more sample size are required for a definitive
      conclusion.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Discuss issues regarding clinical trial design for the development of
      biosimilars in the European Union and the United States, with special focus on
      monoclonal antibodies used in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. METHODS: A 
      search of the Internet as well as PubMed was conducted through June 2014 for
      information related to the clinical development of biosimilars using the keywords
      biosimilar, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriasis,
      psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and ankylosing
      spondylitis. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) websites were searched for biosimilar guidelines. RESULTS:
      The EMA began issuing draft guidelines for the development of biosimilars almost 
      a decade ago and has approved numerous biosimilars. The US FDA has issued draft
      guidances providing stepwise considerations for the nonclinical and clinical
      development of biosimilars but has yet to approve a biosimilar under this
      pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical trials aim to resolve uncertainties that may
      remain following nonclinical development regarding the similarity of the proposed
      biosimilar with the reference product. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
      studies form the backbone of early clinical development and serve to inform phase
      3 clinical development. Factors to be considered in clinical development include 
      study population, design, end points, sample size, duration, and analytical
      methods.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To discuss considerations regarding the selection, prescribing, and
      monitoring of biosimilars in the clinical management of patients with
      inflammatory disorders. METHODS: A search of the Internet as well as PubMed was
      conducted through August 2014 for information related to the clinical use of
      biosimilars in chronic inflammatory disorders using the keywords biosimilar,
      rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic
      arthritis, Crohns disease, ulcerative colitis, and ankylosing spondylitis. The
      European Medicines Agency (EMA) and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      websites were searched for biosimilar guidelines. RESULTS: Articles and
      guidelines relating to integrating biosimilars into the clinical management of
      patients with inflammatory disorders have been published by regulatory agencies, 
      professional associations, healthcare providers, and others. CONCLUSIONS: The
      recent approval of the biosimilar infliximab in some countries makes biosimilars 
      a reality for rheumatologists and others involved in the care of patients with
      inflammatory disorders. To successfully and confidently integrate biosimilars
      into clinical practice, physicians must understand factors such as variation in
      innovator/reference products, extrapolation of data, naming and labeling,
      interchangeability and automatic substitution, and pharmacovigilance.

AB  - Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders are a heterogeneous group of disorders
      characterized by no specific digestive symptoms associated with dense
      eosinophilic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract in the absence of known
      causes for such tissue eosinophilia. Among these diseases, eosinophilic
      gastroenteritis (EGE) and colitis (EC) are less common than esophagitis, but
      their incidence and prevalence have been increasing over the past decade due in
      part to increased disease recognition. The exact pathophysiology is not clear:
      EGE and EC are immune-mediated diseases implicating adaptive T-helper cell type 2
      immunity. According to the site of eosinophilic infiltration, there is a wide
      spectrum of digestive symptoms ranging from food refusal, nausea, vomiting,
      abdominal pain, weight loss, gastrointestinal bleeding (anemia), protein loosing 
      enteropathy, ascites, bowel obstruction or perforation for EGE and diarrhea +/-
      bleeding for CE. Endoscopic lesions are not specific: friability, erythematous
      mucosa with superficial erosions, or ulceration is often observed.
      Histologically, markedly increased numbers of mucosal eosinophils are seen in
      biopsy specimens. However, no standards for the diagnosis of EGE or CE exist and 
      few findings support the diagnosis: intraepithelial eosinophils, eosinophil crypt
      abscesses, and eosinophils in muscularis mucosa and/or submucosa. Other organs
      are not involved. The other causes of tissue eosinophilia (infections,
      inflammatory bowel diseases) should be excluded. Food allergy appears to play a
      central role in driving inflammation in EGE and CE, as evidenced by symptomatic
      improvement with initiation of food exclusion or elemental diets. Dietary
      treatment should be the first therapeutic option in children. If the elimination 
      diet fails, corticosteroids are currently the best characterized treatment but
      appropriate duration is unknown and relapses are frequent. In severe forms,
      immunomodulators or biologic agents (anti-IL5, anti-IgE, or anti-TNFa) can
      potentially play a role in the treatment of EGE and CE.

TI  - Vitamin D therapy in inflammatory bowel diseases: who, in what form, and how
      much?
PG  - 198-209
AB  - BACKGROUND: The north-south geographical gradient of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) prevalence, its epidemiology, the genetic association of vitamin D receptor
      polymorphisms, and results in animal models suggest that vitamin D plays an
      important role in the pathogenesis of IBD. AIMS: The purpose of this review was
      to critically appraise the effectiveness and safety of vitamin D therapy in
      patients with IBD. METHODS: MEDLINE, Scopus and Google Scholar were searched from
      inception to May 20, 2014 using the terms 'Crohn's disease', 'ulcerative colitis'
      and 'vitamin D'. Results: Vitamin D deficiency is common in patients with IBD.
      Limited clinical data suggest an association between low vitamin D concentration 
      and increased disease activity in both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's
      disease (CD). To date, only two small open label trials and one randomized
      controlled trial have shown a positive effect of vitamin D supplementation on
      disease activity in patients with CD; no effect has been shown for UC. An optimal
      vitamin D supplementation protocol for patients with IBD remains undetermined,
      but targeting serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D] levels between 30 and 50 ng/mL
      appears safe and may have benefits for IBD disease activity. Depending on
      baseline vitamin D serum concentration, ileal involvement in CD, body mass index,
      and perhaps smoking status, daily vitamin D doses between 1800-10,000
      international units/day are probably necessary. CONCLUSION: Increasing
      preclinical and clinical evidence suggests a role for vitamin D deficiency in the
      development and severity of IBD. The possible therapeutic role of vitamin D in
      patients with IBD merits continued investigation.

LID - 10.1159/000371687 [doi]
AB  - The composite human gut microbiomes of Western populations have changed over the 
      past century, brought on by new environmental triggers that often have a negative
      impact on human health. Diets high in saturated fats and refined sugars and low
      in fiber are leading candidates for these events and for triggering the increased
      prevalence of immune-mediated diseases like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Our
      studies have shown that consumption of a 'Western' diet high in saturated
      (milk-derived) fat (MF) or n-6 polyunsaturated (safflower oil) fat have similar
      effects on the structure of the colonic microbiome of wild-type and IL- 10(-/-)
      mice, characterized by increased Bacteroidetes and decreased Firmicutes. However,
      the MF diet uniquely promotes the expansion of an immunogenic sulfite-reducing
      pathobiont, Bilophila wadsworthia, a member of the Deltaproteobacteria and minor 
      component of the gut microbiome. This bacterial bloom results from a MF
      diet-induced shift in hepatic conjugation of bile acids, from glycocholic to
      taurocholic (TC) acid, which is important for solubilizing the more hydrophobic
      MF diet. However, it is also responsible for delivery of taurine-derived sulfur
      to the distal bowel, promoting the assemblage of bile-tolerant microbes such as
      B. wadsworthia. The bloom of this species promotes a Th1-mediated immune response
      and the development of colitis in IL-10(-/-) mice. A similar bloom of B.
      wadsworthia is seen when IL-10(-/-) mice are fed a low-fat diet supplemented with
      TC. B. wadsworthia colonization of monoassociated germ-free IL-10(-/-) mice was
      dependent on the host consuming either a high-saturated MF diet or the gavage
      with TC. Together, these data provide a plausible explanation for the link
      between diseases such as IBD and dietary-mediated selection of gut microbial
      pathobionts in genetically susceptible hosts. With this knowledge, it may be
      possible to mitigate the bloom of these types of pathobionts by modifying the
      conjugation states of bile acids.

TI  - Identification of an anti-inflammatory protein from Faecalibacterium prausnitzii,
      a commensal bacterium deficient in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 415-425
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2014-307649 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD)-associated dysbiosis is characterised by a loss 
      of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, whose culture supernatant exerts an
      anti-inflammatory effect both in vitro and in vivo. However, the chemical nature 
      of the anti-inflammatory compounds has not yet been determined. METHODS:
      Peptidomic analysis using mass spectrometry was applied to F. prausnitzii
      supernatant. Anti-inflammatory effects of identified peptides were tested in
      vitro directly on intestinal epithelial cell lines and on cell lines transfected 
      with a plasmid construction coding for the candidate protein encompassing these
      peptides. In vivo, the cDNA of the candidate protein was delivered to the gut by 
      recombinant lactic acid bacteria to prevent dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid
      (DNBS)-colitis in mice. RESULTS: The seven peptides, identified in the F.
      prausnitzii culture supernatants, derived from a single microbial
      anti-inflammatory molecule (MAM), a protein of 15 kDa, and comprising 53% of
      non-polar residues. This last feature prevented the direct characterisation of
      the putative anti-inflammatory activity of MAM-derived peptides. Transfection of 
      MAM cDNA in epithelial cells led to a significant decrease in the activation of
      the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB pathway with a dose-dependent effect. Finally, the
      use of a food-grade bacterium, Lactococcus lactis, delivering a plasmid encoding 
      MAM was able to alleviate DNBS-induced colitis in mice. CONCLUSIONS: A 15 kDa
      protein with anti-inflammatory properties is produced by F. prausnitzii, a
      commensal bacterium involved in CD pathogenesis. This protein is able to inhibit 
      the NF-kappaB pathway in intestinal epithelial cells and to prevent colitis in an
      animal model.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fiber definition includes all those carbohydrates which are not
      digested nor absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract allowing them to reach 
      the colon with no previous processing. Traditionally fiber has been classified
      according to their solubility into soluble and insoluble and different
      physiological properties have been defined for each type. The physiologic role of
      the fiber intake has been studied in diabetes, dyslipidemia or obesity. Fiber
      intake has also demonstrated to be beneficial in the prevention of many
      neoplastic diseases like colorectal cancer. It s also known that fiber plays an
      important role in the faecal excretion of nitrogen. AIM: To evaluate the current 
      evidence that fiber intake plays in the management and prevention of several
      different diseases, being able to determine, if possible, the most recommended
      fiber type for each clinical condition. METHODS: A non-systematic review by
      searching the Medline and Pubmed was made and studies which met the inclusion
      criteria were identified and selected for analysis. RESULTS: Different fiber
      types can be useful for the treatment of several gastrointestinal diseases like
      constipation, diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis remission or
      short bowel syndrome. Patients diagnosed with diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia, 
      hypertension and other cardiometabolic diseases can get a clinical improvement
      with soluble fiber intake. Dietary fiber has demonstrated to play a role in the
      prevention of colorrectal cancer and other neoplastic diseases. Patients with
      hepatic encephalopathy or chronic kidney disease will also benefit from
      fermentable fiber intake. DISCUSSION: Fiber plays an important role in the
      prevention and treatment of many clinical conditions. However further
      investigations are needed to establish specific fiber intake recommendations.

TI  - Characteristics and Prognosis of Allergic Proctocolitis in Infants.
PG  - 69-73
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000767 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The dietary protein proctocolitis, also known as allergic
      proctocolitis (AP), is characterized by the presence of mucoid, frothy, and
      bloody stools in an otherwise healthy infant. The aim of this study was to
      describe a group of children with AP, diagnosed according to the
      criterion-standard method, food challenge to provide clinicians with more
      information on typical presentation, and an overview on nutritional management
      strategies and prognosis. METHODS: We collected data on infants with AP in our
      allergy and gastroenterology outpatient clinics. Any other conditions that may
      cause bloody diarrhea were ruled out. Skin prick tests and atopy patch tests were
      performed for diagnosis, and patients were studied for resolution. To the
      patients whose rectal bleeding did not recover with oligoantigenic maternal diet 
      in addition to amino acid-based formula, endoscopic evaluation was performed to
      confirm the diagnosis and to exclude other reasons of rectal bleeding. RESULTS:
      Sixty patients were diagnosed as having AP. The age of onset was 1.7 +/- 1.32
      months. All of the patients were triggered by milk, 6.6% with milk and egg, 3.3% 
      with milk and chicken, 1.7% with milk and wheat, 1.7% with milk and potato, and
      3.3% had multiple food allergy. 53.3% (n = 32) acquired tolerance by age 1, 25.0%
      (n = 15) by 2 years, 5% (n = 3) by 3, and 1.7% (n = 1) by 4 years. CONCLUSIONS:
      Milk was a triggering factor for all of the patients. Resolution of AP is usually
      within 1 year but symptoms of some patients may continue even longer. An
      extension of the follow-up period is required according to our study.

TI  - Food Intolerance: Immune Activation Through Diet-associated Stimuli in Chronic
      Disease.
PG  - 42-52
AB  - The immune response is a very complex interplay of specific and nonspecific
      branches that have evolved to distinguish between nondangerous and dangerous or
      nontolerated factors. In the past, research has focused on the specific immune
      system much more than the host's innate defense. Studies have shown that a key
      component of the immune response involves activation of the inflammasome. A
      direct relationship between the presence of the inflammasome and the onset of
      disease has already been characterized for a variety of chronic and food-related 
      diseases, including arthrosclerosis, metabolic syndrome, and chronic bowel
      diseases, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The leukocyte
      activation (ALCAT test), an immunological blood test for food intolerance
      reactions, is ideal to identify and eliminate individual food stimuli that may
      act as triggers for the cellular nonspecific immune response. Although the test
      is not diagnostic, studies have established that it can be a useful screening
      tool for the identification of foreign substances that may trigger immune cell
      activation, particularly of neutrophils, leading to inflammatory disorders. The
      ALCAT test, coupled with a targeted diet that is individually tailored according 
      to the test's results, may support immune homeostasis and provide a valuable
      complementary approach for therapy and overall health.

TI  - [Molecular-genetic characterization of shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli
      isolated during a food-borne outbreak in St. Petersburg in 2013].
PG  - 70-81
AB  - UNLABELLED: Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) food-borne infections
      are reported worldwide and represent a serious problem for public healthcare. In 
      the Russian Federation there is little information on epidemiology and etiology
      of STEC-infections as well as on molecular-genetic peculiarities of STEC
      pathogens. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to describe a food-borne outbreak as
      hemorrhagic colitis (HC) along with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS),
      enterocolitis, and acute gastroenteritis in children in St. Petersburg in 2013.
      METHODS: Epidemiological, microbiological, molecular-genetic and bioinformatic
      methods were applied. RESULTS: Objects to study were clinical specimens, milk and
      food samples, as well as STEC strains isolated during the outbreak. The outbreak 
      of food-borne infection was found to be caused by STEC-contaminated raw milk as
      confirmed by epidemiological analysis, detection of STEC DNA and isolation of
      relevant pathogens in milk and sick children fecal specimens. The whole-genome
      sequencing revealed two groups ofpathogens, E. coli O157:H7 and E. coli O101:H33 
      among collected strains. Group I strains were attributed to the previously known 
      sequence type ST24, while group II strains belonged to the previously
      non-described sequence type ST145. In strain genomes of both groups there were
      identified nucleotide sequences of VT2-like prophage carrying stx2c gene, plasmid
      enterohemolysin gene, and gene of the STEC main adhesion factor intimin. Gene of 
      intimin gamma was identified in E. coli O157:H7 strains and intimin iota 2 in E. 
      coli O101:H33 strains. The latter previously was identified only in
      enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) strains. CONCLUSION: The additional knowledge of 
      epidemiology and biology of STEC pathogens would assist clinicians and
      epidemiologists in diagnosing, treating and preventing hemorrhagic colitis.

TI  - Breakthrough Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG bacteremia associated with probiotic use 
      in an adult patient with severe active ulcerative colitis: case report and review
      of the literature.
PG  - 777-81
LID - 10.1007/s15010-015-0798-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics are widely investigated in the treatment of various bowel 
      diseases. However, they may also have a pathogenic potential, and the role of
      Lactobacillus spp. as opportunistic pathogens, mostly following disruption of the
      intestinal mucosa, is emerging. CASE REPORT: We report on a case of bacteremia
      caused by L. rhamnosus GG in an adult patient affected by severe active
      ulcerative colitis under treatment with corticosteroids and mesalazine.
      Lactobacillus bacteremia was associated with candidemia and occurred while the
      patient was receiving a probiotic formulation containing the same strain (as
      determined by PFGE typing), and was being concomitantly treated with i.v.
      vancomycin, to which the Lactobacillus strain was resistant. L. rhamnosus GG
      bacteremia, therefore, was apparently related with translocation of bacteria from
      the intestinal lumen to the blood. CONCLUSIONS: Pending conclusive evidence, use 
      of probiotics should be considered with caution in case of active severe
      inflammatory bowel diseases with mucosal disruption.

TI  - Gastrointestinal food allergies.
PG  - 171-80
LID - 10.1159/000371700 [doi]
AB  - Gastrointestinal food allergies present during early childhood with a diverse
      range of symptoms. Cow's milk, soy and wheat are the three most common
      gastrointestinal food allergens. Several clinical syndromes have been described, 
      including food protein-induced enteropathy, proctocolitis and enterocolitis. In
      contrast with immediate, IgE-mediated food allergies, the onset of
      gastrointestinal symptoms is delayed for at least 1-2 hours after ingestion in
      non-IgE-mediated allergic disorders. The pathophysiology of these
      non-IgE-mediated allergic disorders is poorly understood, and useful in vitro
      markers are lacking. The results of the skin prick test or measurement of the
      food-specific serum IgE level is generally negative, although low-positive
      results may occur. Diagnosis therefore relies on the recognition of a particular 
      clinical phenotype as well as the demonstration of clear clinical improvement
      after food allergen elimination and the re-emergence of symptoms upon challenge. 
      There is a significant clinical overlap between non-IgE-mediated food allergy and
      several common paediatric gastroenterological conditions, which may lead to
      diagnostic confusion. The treatment of gastrointestinal food allergies requires
      the strict elimination of offending food allergens until tolerance has developed.
      In breast-fed infants, a maternal elimination diet is often sufficient to control
      symptoms. In formula-fed infants, treatment usually involves the use an
      extensively hydrolysed or amino acid-based formula. Apart from the use of
      hypoallergenic formulae, the solid diets of these children also need to be kept
      free of specific food allergens, as clinically indicated. The nutritional
      progress of infants and young children should be carefully monitored, and they
      should undergo ongoing, regular food protein elimination reassessments by
      cautious food challenges to monitor for possible tolerance development.

PG  - 38-50
LID - 10.1159/000371666 [doi]
AB  - Food allergy is a potentially life-threatening condition affecting almost 10% of 
      children, with an increasing incidence in the last few decades. It is defined as 
      an immune reaction to food, and its pathogenesis may be IgE mediated, mixed IgE
      and non-IgE mediated, or non-IgE mediated. Potentially all foods can cause food
      allergy, but a minority of foods are responsible for the vast majority of
      reactions reported. A good clinical history is crucial for an accurate diagnosis.
      Allergy tests, including the skin prick test and measurement of specific IgE
      antibodies, are useful tools in the case of IgE-mediated or mixed allergy but
      have not been shown to be of any help in delayed allergic reactions to foods.

      inactive ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 5985-94
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v21.i19.5985 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of probiotic therapy for suppressing relapse
      in patients with inactive ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Bio-Three tablets,
      each containing 2 mg of lactomin (Streptococcus faecalis T-110), 10 mg of
      Clostridium butyricum TO-A, and 10 mg of Bacillus mesentericus TO-A, were used as
      probiotic therapy. Sixty outpatients with UC in remission were randomly assigned 
      to receive 9 Bio-Three tablets/day (Bio-Three group) or 9 placebo tablets/day
      (placebo group) for 12 mo in addition to their ongoing medications. Clinical
      symptoms were evaluated monthly or on the exacerbation of symptoms or need for
      additional medication. Fecal samples were collected to analyze bacterial DNA at
      baseline and 3-mo intervals. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism
      and cluster analyses were done to examine bacterial components of the fecal
      microflora. RESULTS: Forty-six patients, 23 in each group, completed the study,
      and 14 were excluded. The relapse rates in the Bio-Three and placebo groups were 
      respectively 0.0% vs 17.4% at 3 mo (P = 0.036), 8.7% vs 26.1% at 6 mo (P =
      0.119), and 21.7% vs 34.8% (P = 0.326) at 9 mo. At 12 mo, the remission rate was 
      69.5% in the Bio-Three group and 56.6% in the placebo group (P = 0.248). On
      cluster analysis of fecal flora, 7 patients belonged to cluster I, 32 to cluster 
      II, and 7 to cluster III. CONCLUSION: Probiotics may be effective for maintaining
      clinical remission in patients with quiescent UC, especially those who belong to 
      cluster I on fecal bacterial analysis.

TI  - Celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity and inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 267-71
AB  - Celiac disease (CD) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as Crohn's disease
      (CrD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic inflammatory condition of the
      gastro-intestinal tract. The prevalence of IBD in celiac patients has been
      reported as 5-10 times higher than in the general population. The possibility of 
      the presence of CD in IBD should be considered in IBD patients with long-term
      iron deficiency anemia (IDA) not responsive to iron supplementation. Non-celiac
      gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is characterized by intestinal and extra intestinal
      symptoms due to the ingestion of gluten-containing food in subject without CD
      and/or wheat allergy. Patients with Crohn's disease and SR-NCGS were more
      significantly affected by joint pains compared to UC patients (50% versus 11.1%).
      In Crohn's patients, a higher percentage of fatigue (50% versus 38.9%) and
      headache (27.3% versus 22.2%) was evident. For the association between NCGS and
      IBD new studies are warranted and, at this moment, a gluten free diet (GFD) may
      be useful more in CrD than in UC.

AB  - Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia cause a well-characterized spectrum of disease
      in humans, ranging from asymptomatic carriage to hemorrhagic colitis and fatal
      typhoidal fever. These pathogens are responsible for millions of cases of
      food-borne illness in the United States each year, with substantial costs
      measured in hospitalizations and lost productivity. In the developing world,
      illness caused by these pathogens is not only more prevalent but also associated 
      with a greater case-fatality rate. Classic methods for identification rely on
      selective media and serology, but newer methods based on mass spectrometry and
      polymerase chain reaction show great promise for routine clinical testing.

AB  - OCTN1/SLC22A4 is expressed on apical membranes of small intestine, and is
      involved in gastrointestinal absorption of its substrates, including the
      food-derived antioxidant ergothioneine (ERGO). ERGO concentration in circulating 
      blood of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease) is lower than
      that in healthy volunteers; thus, circulating ERGO is a potential diagnostic
      marker, although the mechanisms underlying low ERGO concentration in patients are
      unknown. Here, we focused on intestinal macrophages, which infiltrate sites of
      inflammation, and examined possible first-pass uptake of ERGO by macrophages.
      ERGO concentration in blood was lower in mice with dextran sodium sulfate
      (DSS)-induced colitis than in controls. On the other hand, expression of octn1
      gene product and ERGO concentration in intestinal tissues of DSS-treated mice
      were higher than in controls. Interestingly, lamina propria mononuclear cells
      (LPMCs) isolated from DSS-treated mice contained ERGO and showed [(3)H]ERGO
      uptake and Octn1 expression, whereas ERGO was undetectable in LPMCs of control
      mice. Functional expression of OCTN1 was also confirmed in LPS-stimulated human
      macrophage-like cell line, THP-1. In conclusion, OCTN1 is functionally expressed 
      on activated intestinal macrophages, and ERGO uptake into these immune cells
      could contribute at least in part to the altered disposition of ERGO in
      intestinal inflammation.

TI  - Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Resveratrol in Patients with Ulcerative Colitis: A
      Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-controlled Pilot Study.
PG  - 280-5

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic idiopathic inflammatory
      disease in which reducing pro-inflammatory and/or increasing anti-inflammatory
      molecules is the mainstay of treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
      effects of supplementation with resveratrol as an antiinflammatory and
      antioxidant agent on inflammation and quality of life in patients with active UC.
      METHODS AND RESULTS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 
      50 eligible patients with active mild to moderate UC were supplemented with
      either a 500-mg resveratrol or placebo capsule for 6 weeks. Serum inflammatory
      markers, activity of NF-kappaB in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and
      quality of life were assessed at baseline and at the end of the study.
      Resveratrol supplementation led to a significant reduction in plasma levels of
      TNF-alpha (19.70 +/- 12.80 to 17.20 +/- 10.09 pg/mL) and hs-CRP (4764.25 +/-
      2260.48 to 2584.50 +/- 1792.80 ng/mL) and activity of NF-kappaB in PBMCs (0.19
      +/- 0.05 to 0.10 +/- 0.04 OD) (p <0.001), whereas there were no significant
      changes of these factors in placebo group. Also, the score of inflammatory bowel 
      disease questionnaire -9 (IBDQ-9) increased, whereas the clinical colitis
      activity index score decreased significantly in the resveratrol group (32.72 +/- 
      7.52 to 47.64 +/- 8.59) (p <0.001) and when compared with the placebo group
      (35.54 +/- 9.50 to 41.08 +/- 6.59) (p <0.001). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate
      that 6 weeks supplementation with 500 mg resveratrol can improve quality of life 
      and disease clinical colitis activity at least partially through inflammation
      reduction in patients with UC. Whether these effects will be continued in longer 
      duration of treatment remains to be determined.

TI  - Managing immune checkpoint-blocking antibody side effects.
PG  - 76-83
LID - 10.14694/EdBook_AM.2015.35.76 [doi]
AB  - Immune checkpoint-blocking antibodies that enhance the immune system's ability to
      fight cancer are becoming important components of treatment for patients with a
      variety of malignancies. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) was
      the first immune checkpoint to be clinically targeted, and ipilimumab, an
      inhibitor of CTLA-4, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
      for patients with advanced melanoma. The programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor 
      and one of its ligands, PD-L1, more recently have shown great promise as
      therapeutic targets in a variety of malignancies. Nivolumab and pembrolizumab
      recently have been FDA- approved for patients with melanoma and additional
      approvals within this therapeutic class are expected. The use of anti-CTLA-4 and 
      anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies is associated with side effects known as
      immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Immune-related adverse events affect the
      dermatologic, gastrointestinal, hepatic, endocrine, and other organ systems.
      Temporary immunosuppression with corticosteroids, tumor necrosis factor-alpha
      antagonists, mycophenolate mofetil, or other agents can be effective treatment.
      This article describes the side-effect profile of the checkpoint-blocking
      antibodies that target CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 and provides suggestions on how to
      manage specific irAEs.

TI  - The Value of Vedolizumab as Rescue Therapy in Moderate-Severe Crohn's Disease
      Patients with Adalimumab Non-response in the USA.
PG  - 669-75
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv090 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In May 2014, vedolizumab was approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration for the treatment of moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease. In
      clinical practice it is typically used in patients who are primary or secondary
      non-responders to adalimumab [Humira]. We aim to estimate the incremental
      benefits and costs of using vedolizumab as rescue therapy for adalimumab
      non-responders. METHODS: A Markov model was used to simulate the clinical course 
      of Crohn's disease in a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 patients over a 12-month
      period. The treatment strategies evaluated were adalimumab only [with and without
      dose intensification] and adalimumab and vedolizumab [with and without adalimumab
      dose intensification]. The base case strategy was adalimumab only with 25% of
      non-responders undergoing dose intensification. Our primary outcomes were changes
      in costs and quality of life measures over the analytical horizon. RESULTS: In a 
      1-year period, initiating vedolizumab as rescue therapy in adalimumab
      non-responders reduces the average total cost per patient by 10%, and increases
      the average amount of time spent in remission or mild disease by up to 2 months. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Treating on-label adalimumab non-responders with vedolizumab can, in
      the short term, significantly improves the quality of life of Crohn's disease
      patients that do not respond to adalimumab.

TI  - A review of the efficacy of dietary polyphenols in experimental models of
      inflammatory bowel diseases.

AB  - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis presently have no cure and are treated
      with anti-inflammatory drugs or monoclonal antibodies targeting pro-inflammatory 
      cytokines. A variety of rodent models have been used to model chronic and acute
      colitis. Dietary polyphenols in foods and botanicals are of considerable interest
      for prevention and treatment of colitis. Many dietary polyphenols have been
      utilized for prevention of colitis in rodent models. Berries, green tea
      polyphenols, curcumin, and stilbenes have been the most extensively tested
      polyphenols in rodent models of colitis. The majority of polyphenols tested have 
      inhibited colitis in rodents, but increasing doses of EGCG and green tea,
      isoflavones, flaxseed, and alpha-mangostin have exacerbated colitis. Few studies 
      have examined combination of polyphenols or other bioactives for inhibition of
      colitis. Translating polyphenol doses used in rodent models of colitis to human
      equivalent doses reveals that supplemental doses are most likely required to
      inhibit colitis from a single polyphenol treatment. The ability to translate
      polyphenol treatments in rodent models is likely to be limited by species
      differences in xenobiotic metabolism and microbiota. Given these limitations,
      data from polyphenols in rodent models suggests merit for pursuing additional
      clinical studies for prevention of colitis.

TI  - Dietary fatty acid intakes are related to the risk of ulcerative colitis: a
      case-control study.
PG  - 1255-60
LID - 10.1007/s00384-015-2232-8 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The role of dietary fatty acids in ulcerative colitis (UC)
      pathogenesis has been shown in animal models; however, human studies are rare. We
      hypothesized that there might be a relationship between dietary fatty acid
      composition and the risk of developing incident UC. MATERIAL AND METHODS:
      Overall, 62 new cases of UC and 124 healthy age and sex-matched controls were
      studied. Information on usual diet was measured by a validated country-specific
      food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Logistic regression analysis adjusting for
      potential confounding variables was carried out to compare dietary fatty acid
      intakes between cases and controls. RESULTS: We found positive associations
      between dietary intake of total fat (P value for trend <0.01), oleic acid (P
      value for trend <0.01), saturated fatty acid (SAFA) (P value for trend = 0.02),
      total polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) (P value for trend = 0.04), and trans fat
      (P value for trend <0.01). CONCLUSION: Our results showed that higher
      consumptions of total fats, oleic acid, SAFAs, total PUFAs, trans fat, MUFAs, and
      linoleic acid are significantly associated with increased risk for UC; however,
      no statistically significant associations were detected between the risk of
      disease and n-3 PUFAs and cholesterol intake.

      extend their anti-inflammatory prebiotic potentials.
PG  - 162398
LID - 10.1155/2015/162398 [doi]
AB  - The beneficial effects of carbohydrate-derived fibers are mainly attributed to
      modulation of the microbiota, increased colonic fermentation, and the production 
      of short-chain fatty acids. We studied the direct immune responses to alimentary 
      fibers in in vitro and in vivo models. Firstly, we evaluated the immunomodulation
      induced by nine different types of low-digestible fibers on human peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells. None of the fibers tested induced cytokine production in
      baseline conditions. However, only one from all fibers almost completely
      inhibited the production of anti- and proinflammatory cytokines induced by
      bacteria. Secondly, the impact of short- (five days) and long-term (three weeks) 
      oral treatments with selected fibers was assessed in the trinitrobenzene-sulfonic
      acid colitis model in mice. The immunosuppressive fiber significantly reduced
      levels of inflammatory markers over both treatment periods, whereas a
      nonimmunomodulatory fiber had no effect. The two fibers did not differ in terms
      of the observed fermentation products and colonic microbiota after three weeks of
      treatment, suggesting that the anti-inflammatory action was not related to
      prebiotic properties. Hence, we observed a direct effect of a specific fiber on
      the murine immune system. This intrinsic, fiber-dependent immunomodulatory
      potential may extend prebiotic-mediated protection in inflammatory bowel disease.

AB  - Non-IgE-mediated food allergic disorders account for up to 40% of milk protein
      allergy in infants and young children. We aim to review the recent literature and
      to provide an update on diagnosis and management of food protein-induced
      enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) and food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis
      (FPIAP). The peer-reviewed articles indexed in PubMed have been reviewed. FPIES
      manifests in infants as profuse, repetitive vomiting and lethargy, often with
      diarrhea, leading to acute dehydration, or weight loss and failure to thrive, in 
      chronic form. FPIES is caused most commonly by cow's milk (CM) and soy proteins; 
      rice, oat, and other solid foods may also trigger FPIES. FPIES rarely occurs in
      the exclusively breastfed infants. FPIES is underrecognized; children are often
      mismanaged as having acute viral gastrointestinal illness, sepsis, or surgical
      disease, delaying diagnosis of FPIES for many months. Approximately 25% of
      children with FPIES develop food-specific IgE antibodies and some transition to
      immediate food allergy; IgE positivity is associated with a more protracted
      course. FPIES is a self-limiting condition, with most cases resolving by age
      three to five years. Ondansetron may be helpful in managing acute FPIES. FPIAP is
      a benign condition of bloody stools in a well-appearing infant, with usual onset 
      between one and four weeks of age. Up to 60% of cases occur in exclusively
      breastfed infants and resolve with maternal elimination of CM and soy proteins.
      The majority of cases resolve by age 12 months. FPIES may transition to
      IgE-mediated food allergy in some patients; IgE positivity to the FPIES food is a
      marker of a more persistent disease. FPIAP is benign and resolves by age 12
      months in most patients.

PG  - 629-42
LID - 10.1517/13543776.2015.1041921 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consists of Crohn's disease,
      ulcerative colitis and an unspecific IBD. The unclear etiology of IBD is a
      limiting factor that complicates the development of new pharmacological
      treatments and explains the high frequency of refractory patients to current
      drugs, including both conventional and biological therapies. In view of this,
      recent progress on the development of novel patented products to treat IBD was
      reviewed. AREAS COVERED: Evaluation of the patent literature during the period
      2013 - 2014 focused on chemical compounds, functional foods and biological
      therapy useful for the treatment of IBD. EXPERT OPINION: Majority of the patents 
      are not conclusive because they were based on data from unspecific methods not
      related to intestinal inflammation and, when related to IBD models, few
      biochemical and molecular evaluations that could be corroborating their use in
      human IBD were presented. On the other hand, methods and strategies using new
      formulations of conventional drugs, guanylyl cyclase C peptide agonists,
      compounds that influence anti-adhesion molecules, mAbs anti-type I interferons
      and anti-integrin, oligonucleotide antisense Smad7, growth factor neuregulin 4
      and functional foods, particularly fermented wheat germ with Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae, are promising products for use in the very near future.

      anti-inflammatory response in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 928-39
LID - 10.1007/s00535-015-1084-x [doi]
AB  - Intestinal immune homeostasis is regulated by gut microbiota, including
      beneficial and pathogenic microorganisms. Imbalance in gut bacterial constituents
      provokes host proinflammatory responses causing diseases such as inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD). The development of next-generation sequencing technology
      allows the identification of microbiota alterations in IBD. Several studies have 
      shown reduced diversity in the gut microbiota of patients with IBD. Advances in
      gnotobiotic technology have made possible analysis of the role of specific
      bacterial strains in immune cells in the intestine. Using these techniques, we
      have shown that Clostridium butyricum as a probiotic induces
      interleukin-10-producing macrophages in inflamed mucosa via the Toll-like
      receptor 2/myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 pathway to prevent
      acute experimental colitis. In this review, we focus on the new approaches for
      the role of specific bacterial strains in immunological responses, as well as the
      potential of bacterial therapy for IBD treatments.

TI  - Do the A subunits contribute to the differences in the toxicity of Shiga toxin 1 
      and Shiga toxin 2?
PG  - 1467-85
LID - 10.3390/toxins7051467 [doi]
AB  - Shiga toxin producing Escherichia coli O157:H7 (STEC) is one of the leading
      causes of food-poisoning around the world. Some STEC strains produce Shiga toxin 
      1 (Stx1) and/or Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2) or variants of either toxin, which are
      critical for the development of hemorrhagic colitis (HC) or hemolytic uremic
      syndrome (HUS). Currently, there are no therapeutic treatments for HC or HUS. E. 
      coli O157:H7 strains carrying Stx2 are more virulent and are more frequently
      associated with HUS, which is the most common cause of renal failure in children 
      in the US. The basis for the increased potency of Stx2 is not fully understood.
      Shiga toxins belong to the AB5 family of protein toxins with an A subunit, which 
      depurinates a universally conserved adenine residue in the alpha-sarcin/ricin
      loop (SRL) of the 28S rRNA and five copies of the B subunit responsible for
      binding to cellular receptors. Recent studies showed differences in the
      structure, receptor binding, dependence on ribosomal proteins and pathogenicity
      of Stx1 and Stx2 and supported a role for the B subunit in differential toxicity.
      However, the current data do not rule out a potential role for the A1 subunits in
      the differential toxicity of Stx1 and Stx2. This review highlights the recent
      progress in understanding the differences in the A1 subunits of Stx1 and Stx2 and
      their role in defining toxicity.

TI  - Emerging treatments in Neurogastroenterology: Perspectives of guanylyl cyclase C 
      agonists use in functional gastrointestinal disorders and inflammatory bowel
      diseases.
PG  - 1057-68
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12574 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) and inflammatory bowel
      diseases (IBD) are the most frequent pathologic conditions affecting the
      gastrointestinal (GI) tract and both significantly reduce patients' quality of
      life. Recent studies suggest that guanylyl cyclase C (GC-C) expressed in the GI
      tract constitutes a novel pharmacological target in the treatment of FGID and
      IBD. Endogenous GC-C agonists - guanylin peptides: guanylin and uroguanylin, by
      the regulation of water and electrolyte transport, are involved in the
      maintenance of homeostasis in the intestines and integrity of the intestinal
      mucosa. Linaclotide, a synthetic agonist of GC-C was approved by Food and Drug
      Administration and European Medicines Agency as a therapeutic in
      constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) and chronic idiopathic 
      constipation (CIC). Lately, several preclinical and clinical trials focused on
      assessment of therapeutic properties of synthetic agonists of uroguanylin,
      plecanatide, and SP-333. Plecanatide is currently tested as a potential
      therapeutic in diseases related to constipation and SP-333 is a promising drug in
      ulcerative colitis treatment. PURPOSE: Here, we discuss the most recent findings 
      and future trends on the development of GC-C agonists and their use in clinical
      trials.

AB  - Immunomodulatory antibiotics have been proposed for the treatment of
      multifactorial conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease. Probiotics are able
      to attenuate intestinal inflammation, being considered as safe when chronically
      administered. The aim of the study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects 
      of doxycycline, a tetracycline with immunomodulatory properties, alone and in
      association with the probiotic Saccharomyces boulardii CNCMI-745. Doxycycline was
      assayed both in vitro (Caco-2 epithelial cells and RAW 264.7 macrophages) and in 
      vivo, in the trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) model of rat colitis and the
      dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model of mouse colitis. In addition, the
      anti-inflammatory effect of the association of doxycycline and the probiotic was 
      evaluated in vitro and in vivo in a DSS model of reactivated colitis in mice.
      Doxycycline displayed immunomodulatory activity in vitro, reducing IL-8
      production by intestinal epithelial cells and nitric oxide by macrophages.
      Doxycycline administration to TNBS-colitic rats (5, 10 and 25 mg/kg) ameliorated 
      the intestinal inflammatory process, being its efficacy comparable to that
      previously showed by minocycline. Doxycycline treatment was also effective in
      reducing acute intestinal inflammation in the DSS model of mouse colitis. The
      association of doxycycline and S. boulardii helped managing colitis in a
      reactivated model of colitis, by reducing intestinal inflammation and
      accelerating the recovery and attenuating the relapse. This was evidenced by a
      reduced disease activity index, colonic tissue damage and expression of
      inflammatory mediators. This study confirms the intestinal anti-inflammatory
      activity of doxycycline and supports the potential use of its therapeutic
      association with S. boulardii for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases,
      in which doxycycline is used to induce remission and long term probiotic
      administration helps to prevent the relapses.

AB  - Bifidobacteria have been reported to reduce inflammation and contribute to
      intestinal homeostasis. However, the interaction between these bacteria and the
      gut immune system remains largely unknown. Because of the central role played by 
      dendritic cells (DCs) in immune responses, we examined in vitro the effects of a 
      Bifidobacteria mixture (probiotic) on DC functionality from children with
      inflammatory bowel disease. DCs obtained from peripheral blood monocytes of
      patients with Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis, and noninflammatory bowel
      disease controls (HC) were incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated particles of
      Escherichia coli or DQ-Ovalbumin (DQ-OVA) after a pretreatment with the
      probiotic, to evaluate DC phenotype, antigen sampling and processing. Moreover,
      cell supernatants were collected to measure tumor necrosis factor alpha,
      interferon gamma, interleukin 17, and interleukin 10 production by enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay. DCs from CD children showed a higher bacteria particles
      uptake and DQ-OVA processing after incubation with the probiotic; in contrast, DC
      from both ulcerative colitis and HC showed no significant changes. Moreover, a
      marked tumor necrosis factor alpha release was observed in DC from CD after
      exposure to E. coli particles, whereas the probiotic did not affect the
      production of this proinflammatory cytokine. In conclusion, the Bifidobacteria
      significantly improved the antigen uptake and processing by DCs from patients
      with CD, which are known to present an impaired autophagic functionality,
      whereas, in DCs from ulcerative colitis and HC, no prominent effect of probiotic 
      mixture was observed. This improvement of antigen sampling and processing could
      partially solve the impairment of intestinal innate immunity and reduce
      uncontrolled microorganism growth in the intestine of children with inflammatory 
      bowel disease.

AB  - Obesity is associated with altered gut microbiota and low-grade inflammation.
      Both dietary habits and food composition contribute to the onset of such
      diseases. Emulsifiers, compounds commonly used in a variety of foods, were shown 
      to induce body weight gain, low-grade inflammation and metabolic disorders. These
      dietary compounds promote gut microbiota alteration and gut barrier dysfunction
      leading to negative metabolic alterations.

AB  - Six lactic acid bacteria strains (four Lactobacillus plantarum strains and one
      each of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and Pediococcus pentosaceus) have been
      isolated and shown to possess anti-oxidant activity. In this study, we determined
      their acid, bile, salt resistance, and adhesion activity on human enterocyte-like
      HT-29-Luc and Caco-2 cells. An isolate Lc. lactis S-SU2 showed highest bile
      resistance and adhesion activity compared to type strains. S-SU2 could ferment
      both 10% skimmed milk and soy milk while the type strain could not ferment soy
      milk. Soy milk fermented with S-SU2 showed an increased nitric oxide (NO)
      secretion in the mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells without bacterial
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of the fermented
      soy milk on Escherichia coli O111 LPS-induced NO secretion were higher than those
      of fresh soy milk. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was induced in mice fed
      either 5% (w/v) dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in drinking water or 50% soy milk in
      drinking water. Shortening of colon length, breaking of epithelial cells,
      lowering liver and thymus weights, and enlargement of spleen are some of the
      characteristics observed in the IBD, which were prevented by the use of soy milk 
      fermented with Lc. lactis S-SU2.

TI  - Ipilimumab and immune-mediated adverse events: a case report of anti-CTLA4
      induced ileitis.
PG  - 87
LID - 10.1186/s12885-015-1074-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ipilimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against
      cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 , a key negative regulator of T-cell activation 
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration as of March 2011 for the treatment
      of metastatic melanoma. As a result of the up-regulation of the immune system,
      several immune-mediated adverse effects have been reported including colitis,
      dermatitis, hepatitis and rarely hypophysitis. The most frequent immune-mediated 
      adverse effects described in literature include gastrointestinal toxicity such as
      diarrhea, colitis and case of colitis and ileitis. CASE PRESENTATION: In this
      paper we report an interesting case of immune-mediate ileitis without colitis in 
      a 54 years old woman with metastatic melanoma treated with ipilimumab. We also
      discuss about case management and the possible pathological mechanisms
      considering also previous reports. CONCLUSIONS: The aim of this article is to
      support further investigations concerning epigenetic and genetic analysis in
      order to personalize biological therapy and to reduce immune related adverse
      events observed after ipilimumab administration.

TI  - Single High-Dose Oral Vitamin D3 Therapy (Stoss): A Solution to Vitamin D
      Deficiency in Children With Inflammatory Bowel Disease?
PG  - 411-4
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000823 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Vitamin D deficiency is common in children with inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). The aim of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of 
      stoss therapy on vitamin D levels during a period of 6 months in children with
      IBD and vitamin D deficiency (<50 nmol/L). METHODS: A retrospective chart review 
      was undertaken, focusing upon children managed in the IBD clinic at Sydney
      Children's Hospital between 2006 and 2010. Those with a 25-hydroxyvitamin D
      (25-OHD) level <50 nmol/L and those who received stoss therapy were included in
      this study. RESULTS: A total of 76 children received stoss therapy. There was a
      significant and sustained increase in 25-OHD levels at all of the time points
      compared with baseline (40.8 +/- 7.5 nmol/L), 1 month (145.6 +/- 51.8 nmol/L), 3 
      months (87.1 +/- 28.4 nmol/L), and 6 months 69.2 +/- 31.3 nmol/L). There were no 
      significant changes in serum calcium, phosphate, or parathyroid hormone at any
      time points. CONCLUSIONS: Stoss therapy safely and effectively achieved and
      maintained a level of 25-OHD >50 nmol/L during 6 months in these children with
      IBD. Further prospective studies are now required to confirm this finding and
      establish whether this intervention has other benefits.

TI  - Evaluation of diet pattern related to the symptoms of mexican patients with
      Ulcerative Colitis (UC): through the validity of a questionnaire.
PG  - 25
LID - 10.1186/s12937-015-0014-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is a chronic disease characterized by
      inflammation of colonic mucosa. Environmental factors such as dietary patterns
      may increase symptoms in UC patients. AIM: To validate and implement a
      questionnaire to identify foods that exacerbates symptoms in UC patients.
      METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted to validate and to assess the
      relationship of food and symptoms in Mexican UC patients. RESULTS: The IVC
      obtained was 0.56 in the questionnaire and kappa = 0.03 in foods from animal
      origin, 0.5 cereals and tubers, 0.2 legumes, 0.4 vegetables and fruits, 0.4 fats 
      and 0.3 in others. The evaluation was carried out in UC patients (n = 233), 65%
      active and 35% in UC remission, the current age was 45 (SD; 15) years in active
      UC and 40 (SD; 15) years in UC remission. Three food groups were made based on
      the frequency of symptoms: Group A; symptoms more often, especially the active vs
      remission (P <0.05); Group B caused more symptoms in remission UC vs active UC (P
      = 0.07) and Group C caused more symptoms in the active UC (P = 0.05). CONCLUSION:
      Foods with higher frequency of symptoms in patients with UC were: beans, whole
      milk, plum, lima beans and spicy sauce.

TI  - Systematic review: knowledge and educational needs of patients with irritable
      bowel syndrome.
PG  - 367-71
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0000000000000252 [doi]
AB  - Educational programs have been used as a control condition in trials on
      psychological therapies for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). An optimal control
      condition should have all logistic features of the experimental intervention,
      except the active component, but also have basic therapeutic benefit for the
      patient. The aim of the present study is to systematically determine patients'
      educational needs on the basis of the (mis)conceptions that they have of their
      disease and their reported desire for information to optimize the control
      intervention in IBS research. A systematic review of studies on the knowledge and
      educational needs of IBS patients in terms of their condition was performed.
      Studies published as full text in the English language in peer-reviewed journals 
      and that included adult IBS patients diagnosed according to the Manning or Rome
      I, II, or III criteria were selected. Eight studies involving 2132 patients were 
      included. When focusing on misconceptions of patients, the most prevalent are
      that IBS is caused by dietary factors, food allergies and intolerance (37-90%),
      heredity (52%), or a lack of digestive enzymes (52%); IBS is a form of colitis
      (43%); and will last a lifetime (31-54%), develop into cancer (15-49%), or
      worsens with age (48%). Patients are 'unhappy' with their level of knowledge or
      feel poorly informed (65%). They want information about the diagnostic process,
      which foods to avoid (63%), causes (62%), coping strategies (59%), new
      medications (55%), course (52%), and the role of psychological factors (51%). IBS
      patients do have a large variety of educational needs. Educational programs
      optimally addressing these needs can be used adequately as a placebo control
      condition in research on psychological interventions.

AB  - Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) are a group of diarrheagenic
      bacteria associated with foodborne outbreaks. Infection with these agents may
      result in grave sequelae that include fatality. A large number of STEC serotypes 
      has been identified to date. E. coli serotype O104:H4 is an emerging pathogen
      responsible for a 2011 outbreak in Europe that resulted in over 4000 infections
      and 50 deaths. STEC pathogenicity is highly reliant on the production of one or
      more Shiga toxins that can inhibit protein synthesis in host cells resulting in a
      cytotoxicity that may affect various organ systems. Antimicrobials are usually
      avoided in the treatment of STEC infections since they are believed to induce
      bacterial cell lysis and the release of stored toxins. Some antimicrobials have
      also been reported to enhance toxin synthesis and production from these
      organisms. Various groups have attempted alternative treatment approaches
      including the administration of toxin-directed antibodies, toxin-adsorbing
      polymers, probiotic agents and natural remedies. The utility of antibiotics in
      treating STEC infections has also been reconsidered in recent years with certain 
      modalities showing promise.

TI  - Consumption of vegetables and fruit and the risk of inflammatory bowel disease: a
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 623-30
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0000000000000330 [doi]
AB  - To date, associations between consumption of vegetables and fruit and the risk of
      inflammatory bowel disease have been a controversial subject. Therefore, we
      carried out a meta-analysis to evaluate the associations. A comprehensive search 
      was performed in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the China National Knowledge
      Infrastructure to identify all relevant studies. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with
      95% confidence intervals (CIs) from random-effects or fixed-effects models were
      calculated. Publication bias was estimated using Egger's test and the funnel
      plot. A total of 14 case-control studies were included in this meta-analysis. On 
      the basis of the highest versus the lowest analysis, consumption of vegetables
      was associated inversely with the risk of ulcerative colitis (UC) (OR=0.71, 95%
      CI 0.58-0.88, n=9 studies), but not with Crohn's disease (CD) (OR=0.66, 95% CI
      0.40-1.09, n=8 studies). Higher consumption of fruit was associated inversely
      with the risk of UC (OR=0.69, 95% CI 0.49-0.96, n=8 studies) and CD (OR=0.57, 95%
      CI 0.44-0.74, n=10 studies). For intake of vegetables and the risk of CD,
      subgroup analysis showed a significant association for studies carried out in
      Europe (OR=0.36, 95% CI 0.23-0.57), but not in Asia (OR=1.00, 95% CI 0.50-2.03). 
      No significant publication bias was found for the analysis of intake of
      vegetables and the risk of UC, intake of fruit and the risk of UC, and intake of 
      vegetables and the risk of CD. This meta-analysis indicates that consumption of
      vegetables and fruit might be associated inversely with the risk of UC and CD,
      and the results need to be further confirmed.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of diseases characterized by
      inflammation of the small and large intestine and primarily includes ulcerative
      colitis and Crohn's disease. Although the etiology of IBD is not fully
      understood, it is believed to result from the interaction of genetic,
      immunological, and environmental factors, including gut microbiota. Recent
      studies have shown a correlation between changes in the composition of the
      intestinal microbiota and IBD. Moreover, it has been suggested that probiotics
      and prebiotics influence the balance of beneficial and detrimental bacterial
      species, and thereby determine homeostasis versus inflammatory conditions. In
      this review, we focus on recent advances in the understanding of the role of
      prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics in functions of the gastrointestinal tract
      and the induction and maintenance of IBD remission. We also discuss the role of
      psychobiotics, which constitute a novel class of psychotropic agents that affect 
      the central nervous system by influencing gut microbiota.

TI  - Royal Jelly and its dual role in TNBS colitis in mice.
PG  - 956235
LID - 10.1155/2015/956235 [doi]
AB  - Royal Jelly (RJ) is widely consumed in diets throughout the world due to its
      beneficial effects: antioxidant, antitumor and anti-inflammatory. We have
      investigated the role of RJ in the development of TNBS colitis in mice. Colitis
      was induced by a rectal instillation of TNBS at 0.1 mL per mouse. Intestine
      samples of the animals orally treated with RJ (100, 150, and 200 mg/kg) were
      collected for antioxidant assays (GSH and GSH-Px), proinflammatory protein
      quantification (COX-2 and NF-kappaB), and histological analyses. RJ 100 mg/kg
      maintained GSH levels and increased the activity of GSH-Px, downregulated key
      inflammatory mediators (COX-2 and NF-kappaB), and decreased the lesions caused by
      TNBS as shown by the histological analyses. In conclusion, RJ showed
      anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in experimental colitis, resulting
      in the amelioration of the macroscopic and histological analyses. These results
      corroborate with the RJ supplementation in diets.

AB  - Do food ecosystems feed gut ecosystems? And if so... fuel the immune system?
      Recent developments in metagenomics have provided researchers tools to open the
      "black box" of microbiome science. These novel technologies have enabled the
      establishment of correlations between dysbiotic microbial communities and many
      diseases. The complex interaction of the commensal microbiota with the immune
      system is a topic of substantial interest due to its relevance to health. The
      human gastrointestinal tract is composed of an immense number of resident and
      transient microorganisms. Both may play a direct and vital role in the
      maintenance of human health and well-being. An understanding of the interactions 
      and mechanisms through which commensal and food-derived microbes shape host
      immunity and metabolism may yield new insights into the pathogenesis of many
      immune-mediated diseases. Consequently, by manipulating the contribution of food 
      microbiota to the functionality of the gut ecosystem, there is great hope for
      development of new prophylactic and therapeutic interventions. This paper
      presents some insights and comments on the possible impact of exogenous fermented
      food microbes on the gut homeostasis. We shed light on the similar features
      shared by both fermented food microbes and probiotics. In particular, the key
      role of microbial strains as part of food ecosystems for health and diseases is
      discussed through the prism of fermented dairy products and gut inflammation.

TI  - New therapeutic option for irritable bowel syndrome: serum-derived bovine
      immunoglobulin.
PG  - 3361-6
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v21.i11.3361 [doi]
AB  - Oral prescription medical foods have long been used in hospital settings but are 
      also appropriate therapies for gastrointestinal disorders in outpatient medical
      practice. Oral serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate (SBI) has been
      shown in clinical studies to reduce loose stools and improve stool consistency as
      well as other symptoms (i.e., abdominal pain, bloating, and urgency) in patients 
      with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) and human immunodeficiency
      virus-associated enteropathy. This case series reports the outcomes of 14 IBS
      patients who received SBI as an addition to standard of care at an individual
      physician's clinical practice. The patients: 2 IBS with constipation (IBS-C), 7
      IBS-D, 2 mixed diarrhea and constipation IBS (IBS-M) and 3 undefined IBS (IBS-U; 
      also described by some physicians as IBS-Bloating), ranged in age from 22-87
      years. SBI (5 g or 10 g daily dose) was added to the patient's current standard
      care and followed for several weeks to determine if symptoms were improved with
      the addition of SBI. Overall, 12 of the 14 patients indicated some level of
      improvement through direct questioning of the patients regarding changes from the
      prior visit. One IBS-Bloating patient had a resolution of symptoms and two
      patients (1 IBS-Bloating and 1 IBS-C) discontinued therapy because of
      insufficient relief. The 12 patients who continued on therapy reported an overall
      improvement in symptoms with better stool consistency, decreased frequency as
      well as reductions in abdominal pain, bloating, distention, and incontinence. In 
      most cases, therapeutic effects of SBI were seen within the first four weeks of
      therapy with continued improvements at subsequent visits. SBI has a multifaceted 
      mechanism of action and may help to manage IBS by providing a distinct protein
      source required to normalize bowel function, gastrointestinal microbiota, and
      nutritionally enhance tight junction protein expression between intestinal
      epithelial cells. SBI as a medical food provides a safe option for patients with 
      IBS-D but may have application in other forms of IBS.

TI  - Signatures of adaptation in human invasive Salmonella Typhimurium ST313
      populations from sub-Saharan Africa.
PG  - e0003611
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0003611 [doi]
AB  - Two lineages of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) of
      multi-locus sequence type ST313 have been linked with the emergence of invasive
      Salmonella disease across sub-Saharan Africa. The expansion of these lineages has
      a temporal association with the HIV pandemic and antibiotic usage. We analysed
      the whole genome sequence of 129 ST313 isolates representative of the two
      lineages and found evidence of lineage-specific genome degradation, with some
      similarities to that observed in S. Typhi. Individual ST313 S. Typhimurium
      isolates exhibit a distinct metabolic signature and modified enteropathogenesis
      in both a murine and cattle model of colitis, compared to S. Typhimurium outside 
      of the ST313 lineages. These data define phenotypes that distinguish ST313
      isolates from other S. Typhimurium and may represent adaptation to a distinct
      pathogenesis and lifestyle linked to an-immuno-compromised human population.

TI  - The use of probiotics in pediatric gastroenterology: a review of the literature
      and recommendations by Latin-American experts.
PG  - 199-216
LID - 10.1007/s40272-015-0124-6 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The stability and composition of intestinal flora plays a vital role
      in human wellbeing throughout life from as early as birth. Over the past 50
      years, several studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of probiotic
      administration in pediatric gastroenterology. This document aims to provide a
      recommendation score on probiotic utilization in pediatric gastroenterology,
      together with a review of current knowledge concerning its benefits,
      tolerability, and safety. STUDY DESIGN: Published literature was selected without
      study design restriction: clinical guidelines, meta-analyses, randomized
      controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, outcomes research and case-controlled
      studies were selected using the following MESH-validated terms: probiotics,
      diarrhea, acute diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, traveler's diarrhea,
      bacterial diarrhea, nosocomial diarrhea, prophylactic diarrhea, Helicobacter
      pylori infection, colic, infantile colic, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC),
      inflammatory bowel disease, constipation, and allergy. Once the validity and the 
      quality of results were evaluated, a recommendation score and level of evidence
      were assigned for pediatric gastrointestinal-related conditions, according to the
      updated Evidence-Based Medicine guidelines: 1a for systematic review (SR) of
      RCTs, 1b for individual RCT, 1c for SR and individual RCT, 2a for SR of cohort
      studies, 2b for individual cohort studies, 2c for outcomes research, and 3a for
      SR of case-control studies. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The Latin American Expert
      group consensus recommends the use of the following probiotics for pediatric
      gastrointestinal conditions: prevention of acute infectious diarrhea (AID): 1b
      for Bifidobacterium lactis, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), and L. reuteri;
      prevention of nosocomial diarrhea: 1 b for B. lactis Bb12, B. bifidum, LGG and
      Streptococcus thermophiles; treatment of AID: 1a for LGG and S. boulardii, 1b for
      L. reuteri; prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea: 1b for LGG and S.
      boulardii; prevention of traveler's diarrhea: 1b for S. boulardii; prevention of 
      infantile colic: 1a for L. reuteri DSM 17938; treatment of infantile colic: 1b
      for L. reuteri DSM 17938; prevention of NEC: 1a for B. breve, mixtures of
      Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus, LGG, L. acidophilus and L. reuteri DSM 17938; 
      induction and maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis: 1b for VSL#3;
      improving symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome: 2c for LGG and VSL#3.

TI  - PedsQL gastrointestinal symptoms scales and gastrointestinal worry scales in
      pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease in comparison with healthy
      controls.
PG  - 1115-24
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000351 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcomes are essential in determining the broad
      impact of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and treatments from the patient's
      perspective. The primary study objectives were to compare the gastrointestinal
      symptoms and worry of pediatric patients with IBD with matched healthy controls
      and to compare Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis with each other using the
      Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Gastrointestinal Symptoms and
      Gastrointestinal Worry Scales. METHODS: PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms and
      Worry Scales were completed in a 9-site study by 256 pediatric patients with IBD 
      and 259 parents of patients (263 families; Crohn's disease [n = 195], ulcerative 
      colitis [n = 68]). Ten Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales measuring stomach pain,
      stomach discomfort when eating, food and drink limits, trouble swallowing,
      heartburn and reflux, nausea and vomiting, gas and bloating, constipation, blood 
      in poop, and diarrhea were administered along with 2 Gastrointestinal Worry
      Scales. A matched group of 384 healthy children families completed the PedsQL in 
      an Internet survey. RESULTS: PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales
      distinguished between pediatric patients with IBD in comparison with healthy
      controls (P < 0.001), with larger effect sizes for symptoms indicative of IBD,
      supporting known-groups validity and clinical interpretability including minimal 
      important difference scores. Patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis 
      did not demonstrate significantly different gastrointestinal symptoms or worry in
      comparison with each other. CONCLUSIONS: The PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms and
      Worry Scales may be used as common metrics across pediatric patients with IBD,
      including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis separately to measure
      gastrointestinal-specific symptoms in clinical research and practice.

TI  - The role of probiotic lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria in the prevention
      and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and other related diseases: a
      systematic review of randomized human clinical trials.
PG  - 505878
LID - 10.1155/2015/505878 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn's disease (CD) and
      ulcerative colitis (UC), is a chronic inflammation of the small intestine and
      colon caused by a dysregulated immune response to host intestinal microbiota in
      genetically susceptible subjects. A number of fermented dairy products contain
      lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and bifidobacteria, some of which have been
      characterized as probiotics that can modify the gut microbiota and may be
      beneficial for the treatment and the prevention of IBD. The objective of this
      review was to carry out a systematic search of LAB and bifidobacteria probiotics 
      and IBD, using the PubMed and Scopus databases, defined by a specific equation
      using MeSH terms and limited to human clinical trials. The use of probiotics
      and/or synbiotics has positive effects in the treatment and maintenance of UC,
      whereas in CD clear effectiveness has only been shown for synbiotics.
      Furthermore, in other associated IBD pathologies, such as pouchitis and
      cholangitis, LAB and bifidobacteria probiotics can provide a benefit through the 
      improvement of clinical symptoms. However, more studies are needed to understand 
      their mechanisms of action and in this way to understand the effect of probiotics
      prior to their use as coadjuvants in the therapy and prevention of IBD
      conditions.

TI  - Effectiveness of dietary allergen exclusion therapy on eosinophilic colitis in
      Chinese infants and young children </= 3 years of age.
PG  - 1817-27

AB  - Eosinophilic colitis is a well recognized clinical entity mainly associated with 
      food allergies. Empiric treatment options include dietary allergen exclusion
      (extensively hydrolyzed protein formula and elimination diet), anti-allergy
      medications (antihistamines and leukotriene receptor antagonists) and
      corticosteroids. We evaluated the effectiveness of dietary antigen exclusion on
      clinical remission of eosinophilic colitis in infants and young children. We
      retrospectively reviewed charts of all infants and children </=3 years of age who
      were diagnosed with eosinophilic colitis (defined as mucosal eosinophilia >/=20
      hpf-1) from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2013 at a tertiary children's hospital 
      in China. Forty-nine children were identified with eosinophilic colitis.
      Elemental formula, simple elimination diet or combination therapy resulted in
      clinical improvement in 75%, 88.2% and 80% of patients, respectively. In
      conclusion, eosinophilic colitis in infants and children </=3 years of age
      responded well to dietary allergen exclusion.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease frequently causes intestinal obstruction because of
      extensive fibrosis. This study investigated whether polyphosphate (poly P), an
      active molecule derived from Lactobacillus brevis, could improve the fibrosis in 
      a model of chronic colitis. In this study, dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced
      chronic colitis models and trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis
      models were used as models of fibrosis. To clarify the mechanism responsible for 
      the observed effects, Caco-2/brush border epithelial (BBE) and naive T helper
      lymphocyte (THP)-1 cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce
      inflammation. Non-cancer human colon fibroblast (CCD-18) cells were treated with 
      transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta1) to induce fibrosis. The expression 
      levels of fibrosis- and inflammation-associated molecules were evaluated by both 
      a Western blotting analysis and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
      (RT-PCR). The histologic inflammation and fibrosis were significantly improved in
      the group administered poly P in both the DSS and TNBS colitis models. The levels
      of interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) were 
      significantly decreased by poly P treatment. The expression levels of TGF-beta1
      and collagens in the colitis mice were decreased by poly P. The LPS-induced
      expressions of IL-1beta and TGF-beta1 in Caco-2/BBE cells and of TNF-alpha in
      THP-1 cells were reduced by poly P treatment. Poly P did not affect the
      expression of collagens and connective tissue growth factor in the CCD-18 cells. 
      In conclusion, poly P suppresses intestinal inflammation and fibrosis by
      downregulating the expression of inflammation- and fibrosis-associated molecules 
      in the intestinal epithelium. The administration of poly P is therefore a novel
      option to treat fibrosis because of chronic intestinal inflammation.

TI  - Recombinant human MFG-E8 ameliorates colon damage in DSS- and TNBS-induced
      colitis in mice.
PG  - 480-90
LID - 10.1038/labinvest.2015.32 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by chronic inflammation of the 
      digestive system and typically requires lifelong medical care. Recombinant human 
      MFG-E8 (rhMFG-E8) is a 364-amino acid protein, which promotes apoptotic cell
      clearance and reduces inflammation. This study investigates the therapeutic
      effect of rhMFG-E8 on two well-established mouse models of IBD. Acute mucosal
      injury leading to colitis was caused by exposing C57BL/6 mice to 4% dextran
      sodium sulfate (DSS) in the drinking water over 7 days, and BALB/c mice to a
      single intrarectal dose of 2.75 mg of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS).
      Upon clinical onset of colitis (day 2 in the DSS model and day 1 in the TNBS
      model), mice were treated with daily subcutaneous injections of rhMFG-E8 (60 or
      120 mug/kg/day) or vehicle (saline) for 6 days. Treatment with rhMFG-E8
      significantly attenuated colitis in both models in a dose-dependent way.
      Treatment of DSS-induced colitis with rhMFG-E8 (120 mug/kg/day) decreased weight 
      loss by 59%, the colitis severity score by 71%, and colon shrinkage by 49% when
      compared with vehicle. Similarly, treatment of TNBS-induced colitis with rhMFG-E8
      (120 mug/kg/day) decreased weight loss by 97%, the colitis severity score by 82%,
      and colon shrinkage by 62% when compared with vehicle. In both models, the colons
      of animals receiving rhMFG-E8 showed marked reduction in neutrophil infiltration,
      cytokine and chemokine expression, and apoptotic cell counts. In conclusion,
      rhMFG-E8 ameliorates DSS- and TNBS-induced colitis, suggesting that it has the
      potential to become a novel therapeutic agent for IBD.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex, multi-factorial disease thought to
      arise from an inappropriate immune response to commensal bacteria in a
      genetically susceptible person that results in chronic, cyclical, intestinal
      inflammation. Dietary and environmental factors are implicated in the initiation 
      and perpetuation of IBD; however, a singular causative agent has not been
      identified. As of now, the role of environmental priming or triggers in IBD onset
      and pathogenesis are not well understood, but these factors appear to synergize
      with other disease susceptibility factors. In previous work, we determined that
      the polysaccharide dietary additive, maltodextrin (MDX), impairs cellular
      anti-bacterial responses and suppresses intestinal anti-microbial defense
      mechanisms. In this addendum, we review potential mechanisms for dietary
      deregulation of intestinal homeostasis, postulate how dietary and genetic risk
      factors may combine to result in disease pathogenesis, and discuss these ideas in
      the context of recent findings related to dietary interventions for IBD.

      Study.
PG  - 424-9
LID - 10.1097/SLE.0000000000000128 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The current trial was designed to study and compare the postoperative
      outcomes and systemic acute responses between patients undergoing
      laparoscopic-ileal pouch anal anastomosis (LAP-IPAA) and open IPAA for ulcerative
      colitis. METHODS: The clinical records of patients who underwent 89 restorative
      proctocolectomy procedures with IPAA were reviewed. After determining which
      patients underwent LAP-IPAA versus open IPAA, an equivalent number of controls
      matched for age and ulcerative colitis severity were selected. RESULTS: Twenty of
      22 patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery met the inclusion criteria.
      Patients who underwent LAP-IPAA had significantly shorter times to first walking 
      (P=0.021) and food intake (P=0.0003). The LAP-IPAA group had significantly lower 
      interleukin-6 and interleukin-1ra levels soon after surgery (P=0.011 and
      P=0.0076). The LAP-IPAA group had significantly lower C-reactive protein levels
      on postoperative day 1 (P=0.0027). CONCLUSIONS: LAP-IPAA is a less-invasive
      operative procedure than open IPAA with respect to the postoperative systemic
      inflammatory response and postoperative recovery.

      intestinal anti-inflammatory properties.

AB  - Probiotics have been used as alternative therapies in intestinal inflammatory
      disorders. Many studies have shown that different bacterial probiotic strains
      possess immuno-modulatory and anti-inflammatory properties. However, there is an 
      increasing interest in the use of non-viable bacteria to reduce the risk of
      microbial translocation and infection. The aim of this study was to evaluate
      whether the viability of L. fermentum CECT5716 is essential to exert its
      intestinal anti-inflammatory effect. We compared the preventative effects of
      viable and non-viable probiotic in the TNBS model of rat colitis. In vitro
      studies were also performed in Caco-2 and RAW 264.7 cells to evaluate the
      probiotic effects on IL-8, IL-1beta and nitrite production, and p44/42 and p38
      MAP kinase protein expressions. In vitro results revealed a decrease in the
      stimulated production of pro-inflammatory mediators regardless of the viability
      of the probiotic. Likewise, both forms of the probiotic administered to colitic
      rats produced a significant reduction of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha levels and
      colonic iNOS expression. In conclusion, both live and dead L. fermentum CECT5716 
      have been demonstrated to attenuate the inflammatory process and diminish the
      production of some of the inflammatory mediators. In fact, the viability of this 
      probiotic did not affect its immuno-modulatory and anti-inflammatory properties.

TI  - Efficacy of Dietary Treatment for Inducing Disease Remission in Eosinophilic
      Gastroenteritis.
PG  - 56-64
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000766 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Various dietary interventions have been used to treat patients with
      eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EGE). Concrete evidence as to the effectiveness of 
      such treatments in inducing disease remission is, however, lacking. The aim of
      the study was to systematically review the efficacy of dietary therapies in
      inducing EGE remission. METHODS: We performed a systematic search for the
      MEDLINE, EMBASE, and SCOPUS libraries for studies investigating the efficacy of
      dietary interventions (in both histological and symptomatic remission) for
      children and adults with EGE and colitis. RESULTS: The search yielded 490
      references; 30 were included in the review, with most of these references being
      "low-quality" individual cases or short case series. No significant publication
      bias was found. Elemental diets in children were linked to 75.8% of clinical
      improvement, but few of these patients underwent a histological evaluation.
      Allergy-testing results have been used scarcely in EGE. Empiric elimination of
      allergy-associated foods was the most commonly used option. The variable results 
      in terms of symptom relief, however, were scarcely accompanied by histological
      confirmation. Clinical and methodological heterogeneity hindered the performance 
      of quantitative summaries for the efficacy of dietary therapies in inducing
      disease remission. CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic improvements reported for dietary
      treatment in EGE by most of the available literature are questionable because of 
      the lack of objective evaluation of clinical changes and the very limited
      assessment of histological remission. Because of the relative lack of
      well-designed, high-quality studies, the unequivocal use of dietary treatment for
      patients with EGE and colitis cannot be supported. Further research should be
      undertaken.

TI  - Can inflammatory bowel disease be permanently treated with short-term
      interventions on the microbiome?
PG  - 781-95
LID - 10.1586/17474124.2015.1013031 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis, is a chronic, relapsing and remitting set of conditions characterized by
      an excessive inflammatory response leading to the destruction of the
      gastrointestinal tract. While the exact etiology of inflammatory bowel disease
      remains unclear, increasing evidence suggests that the human gastrointestinal
      microbiome plays a critical role in disease pathogenesis. Manipulation of the gut
      microbiome has therefore emerged as an attractive alternative for both
      prophylactic and therapeutic intervention against inflammation. Despite its
      growing popularity among patients, review of the current literature suggests that
      the adult microbiome is a highly stable structure resilient to short-term
      interventions. In fact, most evidence to date demonstrates that therapeutic
      agents targeting the microflora trigger rapid changes in the microbiome, which
      then reverts to its pre-treatment state once the therapy is completed. Based on
      these findings, our ability to treat inflammatory bowel disease through
      short-term manipulations of the human microbiome may only have a transient
      effect. Thus, this review is intended to highlight the use of various therapeutic
      options, including diet, pre- and probiotics, antibiotics and fecal microbiota
      transplant, to manipulate the microbiome, with specific attention to the
      alterations made to the microflora along with the duration of impact.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease in young patients: challenges faced by black and
      minority ethnic communities in the UK.
PG  - 665-72
LID - 10.1111/hsc.12188 [doi]
AB  - There is strong evidence indicating that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is
      increasing among black and minority ethnic (BME) communities. Despite this rise
      in prevalence, there is a paucity of research relating to ethnicity and IBD
      outside the USA. Furthermore, the symptoms of IBD are reported to start during
      childhood or adolescence in 20-25% of people with the condition. It is therefore 
      important that young people's experiences of diagnosis, treatment and living with
      IBD are fully understood to ensure effective services and information provision. 
      The study reported on in this paper was commissioned by a UK charity (Crohn's and
      Colitis UK) with the aim of increasing understanding of the specific issues and
      service needs of young people with IBD from BME communities. Empirical research
      entailed in-depth semi-structured interviews with 20 young people from BME groups
      accessed through gastroenterology departments at three collaborating NHS
      hospitals in England serving ethnically diverse populations. Interviews were
      carried out from June to December 2010 and sought to capture young people's views
      with IBD. A thematic analysis of their experiences identified many commonalities 
      with other young people with IBD, such as the problematic route to formal
      diagnosis and the impact of IBD on education. The young people also experienced
      tensions between effective self-management strategies and cultural norms and
      practices relating to food. Moreover, the ability of parents to provide support
      was hampered for some young people by the absence of culturally competent
      services that were responsive to the families' communication needs. The findings 
      highlight the need for more culturally appropriate information concerning IBD,
      and improved responsiveness to young people with IBD within primary care and the 
      education system, as well as culturally competent messaging relating to the
      specific nature of the condition among the wider South Asian and black
      communities.

TI  - Advances in knowledge on microscopic colitis: From bench to bedside.
PG  - 98-108
AB  - Microscopic colitis (MC) is a general term that describes a family of chronic
      inflammatory bowel diseases, including lymphocytic colitis (LC) and collagenous
      colitis (CC). The two forms are characterized by chronic watery diarrhea with
      normal or near normal endoscopic colonic appearance and specific
      histopathological abnormalities.Data from recent epidemiological studies reported
      the diagnosis of MC from several different regions in the world, providing that
      it can be a worldwide condition. The etiopathogenesis of MC still remains unknown
      but it is generally accepted that MC is a multifactorial disease, probably
      secondary to an abnormal immune reaction in predisposed individuals, triggered by
      different luminal factors (infections, drugs, autoimmunity and/or bile acids).
      Furthermore, some studies show that the epithelial barrier function in the
      colonic mucosa of MC patients is also impaired. Several mucosal factors of
      intestinal inflammation have been studied in MC, postulating that an aberrant
      T-lymphocyte response may lead to a chronic gut inflammatory condition, with the 
      infiltration of colonic mucosa by different proportion of subset of
      T-lymphocytes. Little is known about the specific inflammatory mediators in MC
      pathogenesis, but a predominant Th1 type cytokine profile has been demonstrated. 
      Currently, a number of medical treatments have been studied in MC patients,
      following mainly an empirical treatment approach. Further studies are needed in
      order to obtain prospective and more evidence-based data. In the future, it will 
      be possible to develop causal treatment approaches after better understanding the
      molecular mechanisms behind the origin of the disease.

TI  - Screening of the novel colicinogenic gram-negative rods against pathogenic
      Escherichia coli O157:H7.

AB  - PURPOSE: Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157:H7 is gram-negative enteric pathogen
      producing different types of Shiga toxin. This bacterium is the most corporate
      cause of haemorrhagic colitis in human. Administration of antibiotics
      (particularly sulfa drugs) against this pathogen is a debatable topic as this may
      increase the risk of uremic syndrome; especially in children and aged people.
      Around the world, microbiologists are in search of alternative therapeutic
      methods specially probiotics against this pathogen. In the present study, we have
      focused on the investigation of alternate bio-therapeutics (probiotics) for the
      treatment of patients infected with E. coli O157:H7. This study is based on the
      identification of colicin-producing gram-negative bacteria (particularly
      enterobacteriaceae) which can competently exclude E. coli O157:H7 from the gut of
      the infected individual. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hundred samples from human,
      animal faeces and septic tank water were analysed for nonpathogenic gram-negative
      rods (GNRs). RESULTS: Out of these samples, 175 isolates of GNRs were checked for
      their activity against E. coli O157:H7. Only 47 isolates inhibited the growth of 
      E. coli O157:H7, among which majority were identified as E. coli. These E. coli
      strains were found to be the efficient producers of colicin. Some of the closely 
      related species i. e., Citrobacter sp, Pantoea sp. and Kluyvera sp. also showed
      considerable colicinogenic activity. Moreover, colicinogenic species were found
      to be nonhaemolytic, tolerant to acidic environment (pH 3) and sensitive to
      commonly used antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Nonhaemolytic, acid tolerant and sensitive
      to antibiotics suggests the possible use of these circulating endothelial cells
      (CEC) as inexpensive and inoffensive therapeutic agent (probiotics) in E. coli
      O157:H7 infections.

TI  - Citrus nobiletin ameliorates experimental colitis by reducing inflammation and
      restoring impaired intestinal barrier function.
PG  - 829-42
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201400614 [doi]
AB  - SCOPE: Inflammatory bowel disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the
      gastrointestinal tract. Citrus nobiletin can exert robust anti-inflammatory
      effects in vivo and in vitro. We evaluated the impact of nobiletin on the
      excessive inflammatory response and impaired barrier function in a rodent colitis
      model. METHODS AND RESULTS: Colitis was established by infusion with 1 mL
      2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) dissolved in ethanol (40% v/v) in rats
      at a 125 mg/kg dose. Caco-2 cell monolayer exposed to LPSs is used as a culture
      model for intestinal permeability measurements. Nobiletin decreased rat
      epithelial proinflammatory cytokines and mediators production. Nobiletin restored
      impaired barrier function in colitic rats and Caco-2 monolayer. Nobiletin
      decreased protein expressions of Akt, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB), and
      myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) isolated from rat intestinal epithelial tissue
      and Caco-2 cell, respectively. PI3K inhibitor or siRNA targeting of either Akt or
      NF-kappaB mitigated the impact of nobiletin on MLCK expression and barrier
      function in Caco-2 monolayer, respectively. CONCLUSION: Nobiletin exerted
      anti-inflammatory effects in TNBS-induced colitis through the downregulation of
      inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) expression.
      Nobiletin restored barrier function, which had been damaged after TNBS
      administration, through the inhibition of the Akt-NF-kappaB-MLCK pathway.

TI  - Oral administration of hen egg white ovotransferrin attenuates the development of
      colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate in mice.
PG  - 1532-9
LID - 10.1021/jf505248n [doi]
AB  - Ovotransferrin (OVT), one of the major hen egg white proteins, was shown to
      possess antimicrobial and antioxidant activities in vitro. However, there is no
      information regarding the in vivo preventative effect in chronic inflammatory
      diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of the present study
      is to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of OVT in a mouse model of dextran
      sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. OVT (50 or 250 mg/kg BW) was given orally
      for 14 days to female BALB/c mice, and 5% DSS (MW 36-50 kDa) was used to induce
      acute colitis (days 7-14) via drinking water. The current in vivo study
      demonstrated that OVT significantly reduced clinical signs, weight loss,
      shortening of the colon, and inflammatory cytokine markers of disease. The
      histopathological analysis of the colon revealed that OVT reduced histological
      scores. These results indicate that the use of OVT may be a potential promising
      candidate for the prevention of IBD.

TI  - Porcine beta-defensin 2 attenuates inflammation and mucosal lesions in dextran
      sodium sulfate-induced colitis.
PG  - 1882-93
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1402300 [doi]
AB  - Intestinal permeability plays a critical role in the etiopathogenesis of
      ulcerative colitis. Defensins, including porcine beta-defensin (pBD)2, are
      crucial antimicrobial peptides for gut protection owing to their antibacterial
      and immunomodulatory activities. The purpose of this study was to investigate the
      protective effects of pBD2 on mucosal injury and the disruption of the epithelial
      barrier during the pathological process of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced
      colitis. The effects and mechanism of pBD2 were evaluated both using a
      DSS-induced C57BL/6 mouse model and, in vitro, using Caco-2 and RAW264.7 cells.
      DSS-induced colitis was characterized by higher disease activity index, shortened
      colon length, elevated activities of myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase,
      histologic evidence of inflammation, and increased expression levels of
      TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-8. pBD2 increased the expression of zonula occludens-1,
      zonula occludens-2, claudin-1, mucin-1, and mucin-2 mRNA and proteins, and it
      decreased permeability to FITC-D, as well as apoptosis, in DSS-treated mice. pBD2
      also decreased inflammatory infiltrates of the colon epithelium. In Caco-2 cells,
      pBD2 increased transepithelial electrical resistance and mucin mRNA expression,
      and it decreased the permeability of FITC-D while preserving the structural
      integrity of the tight junctions. The effects of pBD2 appeared to be through
      upregulation of the expression of genes associated with tight junctions and
      mucins, and by suppressing DSS-induced increases in inflammation, inducible NO
      synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, and apoptosis. These results show that pBD2 improves 
      DSS-induced changes in mucosal lesions and paracellular permeability, possibly by
      affecting the activation of NF-kappaB signaling. The present study demonstrates
      that intrarectal administration of pBD2 may be a novel preventive option for
      ulcerative colitis.

AB  - Some of the most common symptoms of the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD, which
      include ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) are abdominal pain, diarrhea, and
      weight loss. It is therefore not surprising that clinicians and patients have
      wondered whether dietary patterns influence the onset or course of IBD. The
      question of what to eat is among the most commonly asked by patients, and among
      the most difficult to answer for clinicians. There are substantial variations in 
      dietary behaviors of patients and recommendations for them, although clinicians
      do not routinely endorse specific diets for patients with IBD. Dietary clinical
      trials have been limited by their inability to include a placebo control,
      contamination of study groups, and inclusion of patients receiving medical
      therapies. Additional challenges include accuracy of information on dietary
      intake, complex interactions between foods consumed, and differences in food
      metabolism among individuals. We review the roles of diet in the etiology and
      management of IBD based on plausible mechanisms and clinical evidence.
      Researchers have learned much about the effects of diet on the mucosal immune
      system, epithelial function, and the intestinal microbiome; these findings could 
      have significant practical implications. Controlled studies of patients receiving
      enteral nutrition and observations made from patients on exclusion diets have
      shown that components of whole foods can have deleterious effects for patients
      with IBD. Additionally, studies in animal models suggested that certain nutrients
      can reduce intestinal inflammation. In the future, engineered diets that restrict
      deleterious components but supplement beneficial nutrients could be used to
      modify the luminal intestinal environment of patients with IBD; these might be
      used alone or in combination with immunosuppressive agents, or as salvage therapy
      for patients who do not respond or lose responsiveness to medical therapies.
      Stricter diets might be required to induce remission, and more sustainable
      exclusion diets could be used to maintain long-term remission.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor 8 (MFG-E8) promotes
      phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells to maintain normal tissue homeostasis.
      However, its functions in intestinal inflammation and carcinogenesis are unknown.
      METHODS: Experimental colitis was induced in MFG-E8 knockout (KO) and wild-type
      (WT) mice by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) administration. Colon tissues were used
      for assessments of colitis activity and epithelial proliferation. A mouse
      colitis-associated cancer (CAC) model was induced by intraperitoneal injection of
      azoxymethane (AOM) and then the animals were given a single administration of
      DSS. A sporadic colon cancer model was established by repeated intraperitoneal
      injections of AOM. The role of MFG-E8 in epithelial proliferation with or without
      treatment of siRNA targeting alpha(v)-integrin was examined in vitro using a
      WST-1 assay. RESULTS: The severity of colitis in KO mice was greater than that in
      WT mice, while the proliferative potential of colonic epithelial cells in KO mice
      was lower during the regenerative phase. In both CAC and sporadic models, tumor
      size in KO was lower as compared to WT mice, while decreased tumor incidence was 
      only found in the CAC model. In vitro findings showed that MFG-E8 promotes
      epithelial cell proliferation, and treatment with a siRNA targeting
      alpha(v)-integrin reduced the proliferation of Colon-26 cells stimulated with
      recombinant MFG-E8. CONCLUSIONS: MFG-E8 promotes tumor growth regardless of the
      presence or absence of colonic inflammation, whereas colon tumor development is
      initiated by MFG-E8 under inflammatory conditions. These MFG-E8 functions may be 
      dependent on integrin-mediated cellular signaling.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The relevance of spatial composition in the microbial changes
      associated with UC is unclear. We coupled luminal brush samples, mucosal biopsies
      and laser capture microdissection with deep sequencing of the gut microbiota to
      develop an integrated spatial assessment of the microbial community in controls
      and UC. DESIGN: A total of 98 samples were sequenced to a mean depth of 31,642
      reads from nine individuals, four control volunteers undergoing routine
      colonoscopy and five patients undergoing surgical colectomy for
      medically-refractory UC. Samples were retrieved at four colorectal locations,
      incorporating the luminal microbiota, mucus gel layer and whole mucosal biopsies.
      RESULTS: Interpersonal variability accounted for approximately half of the total 
      variance. Surprisingly, within individuals, asymmetric Eigenvector map analysis
      demonstrated differentiation between the luminal and mucus gel microbiota, in
      both controls and UC, with no differentiation between colorectal regions. At a
      taxonomic level, differentiation was evident between both cohorts, as well as
      between the luminal and mucosal compartments, with a small group of taxa uniquely
      discriminating the luminal and mucosal microbiota in colitis. There was no
      correlation between regional inflammation and a breakdown in this spatial
      differentiation or bacterial diversity. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates a
      conserved spatial structure to the colonic microbiota, differentiating the
      luminal and mucosal communities, within the context of marked interpersonal
      variability. While elements of this structure overlap between UC and control
      volunteers, there are differences between the two groups, both in terms of the
      overall taxonomic composition and how spatial structure is ascribable to distinct
      taxa.

TI  - gamma-Glutamyl cysteine and gamma-glutamyl valine inhibit TNF-alpha signaling in 
      intestinal epithelial cells and reduce inflammation in a mouse model of colitis
      via allosteric activation of the calcium-sensing receptor.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is distributed
      throughout the gastrointestinal tract, and its activation has been shown to
      promote intestinal homeostasis, suggesting that CaSR may be a promising target
      for novel therapies to prevent chronic intestinal inflammation such as
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The gamma-glutamyl dipeptides gamma-glutamyl
      cysteine (gamma-EC) and gamma-glutamyl valine (gamma-EV) are dietary flavor
      enhancing compounds, and have been shown to activate CaSR via allosteric ligand
      binding. The aim of this study was to examine the anti-inflammatory effects of
      gamma-EC and gamma-EV in vitro in intestinal epithelial cells and in a mouse
      model of intestinal inflammation. RESULTS: In vitro, treatment of Caco-2 cells
      with gamma-EC and gamma-EV resulted in the CaSR-mediated reduction of
      TNF-alpha-stimulated pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including IL-8,
      IL-6, and IL-1beta, and inhibited phosphorylation of JNK and IkappaBalpha, while 
      increasing expression of IL-10. In vivo, using a mouse model of dextran sodium
      sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis, gamma-EC and gamma-EV treatment ameliorated
      DSS-induced clinical signs, weight loss, colon shortening and histological
      damage. Moreover, gamma-EC and gamma-EV reduced the expression of TNF-alpha,
      IL-6, INF-gamma, IL-1beta, and IL-17, and increased the expression of IL-10 in
      the colon, in a CaSR-dependent manner. The CaSR-mediated anti-inflammatory
      effects of gamma-EC were abrogated in beta-arrestin2 knock-down Caco-2 cells, and
      involvement of beta-arrestin2 was found to inhibit TNF-alpha-dependent signaling 
      via cross-talk with the TNF-alpha receptor (TNFR). CONCLUSIONS: Thus CaSR
      activation by gamma-EC and gamma-EV can aid in maintaining intestinal homeostasis
      and reducing inflammation in chronic inflammatory conditions such as IBD.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Many Chinese herbs are traditionally used as
      medicine to improve the functions of gastrointestinal tract. Some of these herbs 
      are also promising agents for the improvement of the gut microbiota and the
      treatment of ulcerative colitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: By screening seven
      traditional Chinese herbs, we found that Red Ginseng and Semen Coicis were the
      most effective in promoting the growth of probiotics including Lactobacillus and 
      Bifidobacterium in vitro. We then evaluated the effects of Red Ginseng and Semen 
      Coicis on the growth of the bacterial pathogens (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus
      aureus, and Salmonella spp.) in vitro. In in vivo experiment, we gavage
      administrated trinitro-benzene-sulfonic acid induced ulcerative colitis (UC) rats
      with Red Ginseng and Semen Coicis extracts. After two weeks treatment, we
      analyzed the structure of the gut microbiota and examined the UC symptoms by
      employing qPCR and animal pathology detection techniques. RESULTS: Both Red
      Ginseng and Semen Coicis promoted the growth of probiotics - Bifidobacterium and 
      Lactobacillus in vitro. Red Ginseng also inhibited the growth of some pathogen
      strains. In vivo, Red Ginseng and Semen Coicis improved the structure of gut
      microbiota and relieved the symptoms of ulcerative colitis in vivo. Compared with
      Semen Coicis, Red Ginseng was more effective in relieving the symptoms of
      ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Red Ginseng could promote the growth of
      probiotic bacteria in vitro. Red Ginseng and, to a lesser extent Semen Coicis,
      gave positive results in an experimental in vivo model for ulcerative colitis.

AB  - To accommodate the vast antigenic exposure from both food components and
      commensal bacteria, the gut has evolved a naturally anti-inflammatory
      environment. We have recently shown that lactic acid bacteria (LAB), a major
      population of small intestinal microbiota and often found in fermented foods,
      contain a large amount of double-stranded RNA and capable of inducing
      interferon-beta (IFN-beta) production from dendritic cells (DCs) via the
      Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) pathway. It is a significant feature of LAB and was
      not observed in other bacteria tested. Moreover, IFN-beta secreted in response to
      LAB prevented experimental colitis. These results identify TLR3 as a sensor to
      small intestinal commensal bacteria and contribute to anti-inflammatory
      mechanism. We also show that oral administration of beta-glucan enhance
      intestinal and systemic immune response in dectin-1-dependent manner. Thus
      elucidation of "gut to systemic immune-homeostasis" mediated by innate signals
      will be valued for the development of gut-biology and science-based food
      immunology, with a focus on innovation in the health and medical industries.

AB  - Conventional medical treatment for ulcerative colitis can have limited efficacy
      or severe adverse reactions requiring additional treatment or colectomy. Hence,
      different biological agents that target specific immunological pathways are
      be-ing investigated for treating ulcerative colitis. Anti-tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF) agents were the first biologics to be used for treating inflammatory bowel 
      disease. For example, infliximab and adalimumab, which are anti-TNF agents, are
      be-ing used for treating ulcerative colitis. Recently, golimumab, another
      anti-TNF agent, and vedolizumab, an anti-adhesion therapy, have been approved for
      ulcerative colitis by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In addition, new
      medications such as tofacitinib, a Janus kinase inhibitor, and etrolizumab,
      another anti-adhesion therapy, are emerging as therapeutic agents. Therefore,
      there is a need for further studies to select appropriate patient groups for
      these biologics and to improve the outcomes of ulcerative colitis treatment
      through appropriate medical usage.

TI  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli colonization of human colonic epithelium in
      vitro and ex vivo.
PG  - 942-9
LID - 10.1128/IAI.02928-14 [doi]
AB  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is an important foodborne pathogen
      causing gastroenteritis and more severe complications, such as hemorrhagic
      colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome. Pathology is most pronounced in the colon,
      but to date there is no direct clinical evidence showing EHEC binding to the
      colonic epithelium in patients. In this study, we investigated EHEC adherence to 
      the human colon by using in vitro organ culture (IVOC) of colonic biopsy samples 
      and polarized T84 colon carcinoma cells. We show for the first time that EHEC
      colonizes human colonic biopsy samples by forming typical attaching and effacing 
      (A/E) lesions which are dependent on EHEC type III secretion (T3S) and binding of
      the outer membrane protein intimin to the translocated intimin receptor (Tir).
      A/E lesion formation was dependent on oxygen levels and suppressed under
      oxygen-rich culture conditions routinely used for IVOC. In contrast, EHEC
      adherence to polarized T84 cells occurred independently of T3S and intimin and
      did not involve Tir translocation into the host cell membrane. Colonization of
      neither biopsy samples nor T84 cells was significantly affected by expression of 
      Shiga toxins. Our study suggests that EHEC colonizes and forms stable A/E lesions
      on the human colon, which are likely to contribute to intestinal pathology during
      infection. Furthermore, care needs to be taken when using cell culture models, as
      they might not reflect the in vivo situation.

TI  - Randomized clinical trial of the effect of gum chewing on postoperative ileus and
      inflammation in colorectal surgery.
PG  - 202-11
LID - 10.1002/bjs.9691 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postoperative ileus (POI) is a common complication following
      colorectal surgery that delays recovery and increases length of hospital stay.
      Gum chewing may reduce POI and therefore enhance recovery after surgery. The aim 
      of the study was to evaluate the effect of gum chewing on POI, length of hospital
      stay and inflammatory parameters. METHODS: Patients undergoing elective
      colorectal surgery in one of two centres were randomized to either chewing gum or
      a dermal patch (control). Chewing gum was started before surgery and stopped when
      oral intake was resumed. Primary endpoints were POI and length of stay. Secondary
      endpoints were systemic and local inflammation, and surgical complications.
      Gastric emptying was measured by ultrasonography. Soluble tumour necrosis factor 
      receptor 1 (TNFRSF1A) and interleukin (IL) 8 levels were measured by
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Between May 2009 and September 2012, 
      120 patients were randomized to chewing gum (58) or dermal patch (control group; 
      62). Mean(s.d.) length of hospital stay was shorter in the chewing gum group than
      in controls, but this difference was not significant: 9.5(4.9) versus 14.0(14.5) 
      days respectively. Some 14 (27 per cent) of 52 analysed patients allocated to
      chewing gum developed POI compared with 29 (48 per cent) of 60 patients in the
      control group (P = 0.020). More patients in the chewing gum group first
      defaecated within 4 days of surgery (85 versus 57 per cent; P = 0.006) and passed
      first flatus within 48 h (65 versus 50 per cent; P = 0.044). The decrease in
      antral area measured by ultrasonography following a standard meal was
      significantly greater among patients who chewed gum: median 25 (range -36 to 54) 
      per cent compared with 10 (range -152 to 54) per cent in controls (P = 0.004).
      Levels of IL-8 (133 versus 288 pg/ml; P = 0.045) and TNFRSF1A (0.74 versus 0.92
      ng/ml; P = 0.043) were lower among patients in the chewing gum group. Fewer
      patients in this group developed a grade IIIb complication (2 of 58 versus 10 of 
      62; P = 0.031). CONCLUSION: Gum chewing is a safe and simple treatment to reduce 
      POI, and is associated with a reduction in systemic inflammatory markers and
      complications. REGISTRATION NUMBER: NTR2867 (http://www.trialregister.nl).

AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic debilitating disorders of unknown 
      etiology, consisting of two main conditions, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
      disease. Major advances have recently taken place in human genetic studies of IBD
      and over 160 risk loci for these two diseases have been uncovered. These genetic 
      data highlight a key role for genes that code for immunological and epithelial
      barrier functions. Environmental factors also make substantial contributions to
      the pathogenesis of IBD and account for the growing incidence of the diseases
      around the world. Intestinal microbiota creates resistance to infection, provides
      nutrients, and educates the immune system and in many ways has a significant
      impact on human health. Aberrant microbiota composition and decreased diversity
      (dysbiotic microbiota) are key etiopathological events in IBD. Dysbiotic
      microbiota can lead to loss of normal, regulatory immune effects in the gut
      mucosa. This may play a central role in the development and perpetuation of
      chronic inflammation. Further, the expression of specific innate immune receptors
      that recognize microbes is altered in the IBD epithelium. Therefore, the
      combination of host side epithelial barrier functions and the presence of
      dysbiotic microbiota in the gut together promote inflammation. New therapeutic
      options targeting microbiota are currently considered for IBD and they may, in
      the future, provide means to reverse the pathogenic host-microbiota relationship 
      into a symbiotic one. In this review, the focus is on the intestinal microbiota
      and host-microbe interactions in IBD.

AB  - Gut microbial metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids have attracted much
      attention because of their various physiological properties. Dysfunction of tight
      junction (TJ) in the intestine contributes to the pathogenesis of many disorders 
      such as inflammatory bowel disease. We evaluated the effects of five novel gut
      microbial metabolites on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced barrier
      impairment in Caco-2 cells and dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in mice.
      10-Hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic acid (HYA), a gut microbial metabolite of linoleic
      acid, suppressed TNF-alpha and dextran sulfate sodium-induced changes in the
      expression of TJ-related molecules, occludin, zonula occludens-1, and myosin
      light chain kinase. HYA also suppressed the expression of TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2) 
      mRNA and protein expression in Caco-2 cells and colonic tissue. In addition, HYA 
      suppressed the protein expression of TNFR2 in murine intestinal epithelial cells.
      Furthermore, HYA significantly up-regulated G protein-coupled receptor (GPR) 40
      expression in Caco-2 cells. It also induced [Ca(2+)]i responses in HEK293 cells
      expressing human GPR40 with higher sensitivity than linoleic acid, its metabolic 
      precursor. The barrier-recovering effects of HYA were abrogated by a GPR40
      antagonist and MEK inhibitor in Caco-2 cells. Conversely, 10-hydroxyoctadacanoic 
      acid, which is a gut microbial metabolite of oleic acid and lacks a carbon-carbon
      double bond at Delta12 position, did not show these TJ-restoring activities and
      down-regulated GPR40 expression. Therefore, HYA modulates TNFR2 expression, at
      least partially, via the GPR40-MEK-ERK pathway and may be useful in the treatment
      of TJ-related disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), most commonly ulcerative colitis (UC) and
      Crohn's disease (CD), is a chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract.
      Patients affected with IBD experience symptoms including abdominal pain,
      persistent diarrhea, rectal bleeding, and weight loss. There is no cure for IBD; 
      thus treatments typically focus on preventing complications, inducing and
      maintaining remission, and improving quality of life. During IBD, dysregulation
      of the intestinal immune system leads to increased production of pro-inflammatory
      cytokines, such as TNF-alpha and IL-6, and recruitment of activated immune cells 
      to the intestine, causing tissue damage and perpetuating the inflammatory
      response. Recent biological therapies targeting specific inflammatory cytokines
      or pathways, in particular TNF-alpha, have shown promise, but not all patients
      respond to treatment, and some individuals become intolerant to treatment over
      time. Dietary peptides and amino acids (AAs) have been shown to modulate
      intestinal immune functions and influence inflammatory responses, and may be
      useful as alternative or ancillary treatments in IBD. This review focuses on
      dietary interventions for IBD treatment, in particular the role of dietary
      peptides and AAs in reducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in the
      gut, as well as recent advances in the cellular mechanisms responsible for their 
      anti-inflammatory activity.

AB  - Loss-of-function variants within the gene locus encoding protein tyrosine
      phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2) are associated with increased risk for
      Crohn's disease (CD). A disturbed regulation of T helper (Th) cell responses
      causing loss of tolerance against self- or commensal-derived antigens and an
      altered intestinal microbiota plays a pivotal role in CD pathogenesis. Loss of
      PTPN2 in the T-cell compartment causes enhanced induction of Th1 and Th17 cells, 
      but impaired induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in several mouse colitis
      models, namely acute and chronic dextran sodium sulfate colitis, and T-cell
      transfer colitis models. This results in increased susceptibility to intestinal
      inflammation and intestinal dysbiosis which is comparable with that observed in
      CD patients. We detected inflammatory infiltrates in liver, kidney, and skin and 
      elevated autoantibody levels indicating systemic loss of tolerance in
      PTPN2-deficient animals. CD patients featuring a loss-of-function PTPN2 variant
      exhibit enhanced Th1 and Th17 cell, but reduced Treg markers when compared with
      PTPN2 wild-type patients in serum and intestinal tissue samples. Our data
      demonstrate that dysfunction of PTPN2 results in aberrant T-cell differentiation 
      and intestinal dysbiosis similar to those observed in human CD. Our findings
      indicate a novel and crucial role for PTPN2 in chronic intestinal inflammation.

TI  - Vitamin D as a novel therapy in inflammatory bowel disease: new hope or false
      dawn?
PG  - 5-12
LID - 10.1017/S0029665114001621 [doi]
AB  - There is increasing scientific interest in the field of vitamin D research,
      moving the focus beyond bone health to other disease processes. Low circulating
      vitamin D levels have been reported as a risk factor for several
      pathophysiologically divergent diseases, including cancers, diabetes, CVD,
      multiple sclerosis and inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and 
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). But, therein, remains the challenge: can any
      single nutrient contribute to multiple complex disease mechanisms and,
      ultimately, have therapeutic potential? The aim of this review is to critically
      evaluate several strands of scientific evidence surrounding vitamin D and
      inflammation, primarily focusing on IBD. Epidemiological studies suggest an
      increased incidence of IBD and rheumatoid arthritis in countries of more northern
      latitudes, mirroring sunlight patterns. A considerable body of evidence supports 
      the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D, at least in animal models of IBD.
      Although it is accepted that suboptimal vitamin D status is common in IBD, some
      studies suggest that this associates with more severe disease. With regard to
      treatment, the data are only beginning to emerge from randomised controlled
      trials to suggest that people with IBD may remain in remission longer when
      treated with oral vitamin D. In conclusion, several strands of evidence suggest
      that vitamin D may modify the immune response in IBD. There is a continued need
      for large well-designed clinical trials and mechanistic studies to determine if, 
      and how, this emerging promise translates into tangible clinical benefits for
      people with chronic debilitating diseases such as IBD.

PG  - 194-201

AB  - The shiga-toxin (Stx)-producing human pathogen Escherichia coli serotype O157:H7 
      is a highly pathogenic subgroup of Stx-producing E. coli (STEC) with food-borne
      etiology and bovine reservoir. Each year in the U. S., approximately 100,000
      patients are infected with enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) of the O157:H7
      serotype. This food-borne pathogen is a global public health threat responsible
      for widespread outbreaks of human disease. Since its initial discovery in 1982,
      O157:H7 has rapidly become the dominant EHEC serotype in North America.
      Hospitalization rates among patients as high as 50% have been reported for severe
      outbreaks of human disease. Symptoms of disease can rapidly deteriorate and
      progress to life-threatening complications such as Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome
      (HUS), the leading cause of kidney failure in children, or Hemorrhagic Colitis.
      In depth understanding of the genomic diversity that exists among currently
      circulating EHEC populations has broad applications for improved molecular-guided
      biosurveillance, outbreak preparedness, diagnostic risk assessment, and
      development of alternative toxin-suppressing therapeutics.

AB  - Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens M1 (M1) has been shown to possess many different
      beneficial health effects including anti-colitis activity. The purpose of this
      study was to develop a novel and easily scaled-up encapsulating technique that
      would improve the temperature tolerance of the bacterium and reduce the
      sensitivity of the organism to gastrointestinal fluid. A mixture of sodium
      alginate, gellan gum and skim milk powder was used as a coating material to
      entrap M1. The M1 gel was then directly freeze dried in order to dehydrate the
      covering and form microcapsules. The viable cell numbers of M1 present only
      dropped ten folds after the freeze-drying encapsulation process. The viable cell 
      counts remained constant at 5 x 10(7) CFU/g after heating from 25 degrees C to 75
      degrees C and holding at 75 degrees C for 1 min. The viable cell counts were
      reduced to 10(6) CFU/g and 10(5) CFU/g after 8-week storage at 4 degrees C and
      subsequent heat treatment with simulated gastrointestinal fluid test (SGFT) and
      bile salts, respectively. The effect of encapsulated M1 on the organism's
      anti-colitis activity was evaluated using the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)
      induced colitis mouse model. An in vivo study indicated that administration of
      heat treated encapsulated M1 was able to ameliorate DSS-induced colitis producing
      a significant reduction in the bleeding score and an attenuation of inflammatory 
      score. These findings clearly demonstrate that encapsulation of M1 using this
      novel technique is able to provide good protection from temperature changes and
      SGFT treatment and also does not affect the organism's anti-colitis activity.

AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are intestinal disorders that
      comprise the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). These disorders have a
      significant effect on the quality of life of affected patients and the increasing
      number of IBD cases worldwide is a growing concern. Because of the overall burden
      of IBD and its multifactorial etiology, efforts have been made to improve the
      medical management of these inflammatory conditions. The classical therapeutic
      strategies aim to control the exacerbated host immune response with
      aminosalicylates, antibiotics, corticosteroids, thiopurines, methotrexate and
      anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) biological agents. Although successful in the
      treatment of several CD or UC conditions, these drugs have limited effectiveness,
      and variable responses may culminate in unpredictable outcomes. The ideal therapy
      should reduce inflammation without inducing immunosuppression, and remains a
      challenge to health care personnel. Recently, a number of additional approaches
      to IBD therapy, such as new target molecules for biological agents and cellular
      therapy, have shown promising results. A deeper understanding of IBD pathogenesis
      and the availability of novel therapies are needed to improve therapeutic
      success. This review describes the overall key features of therapies currently
      employed in clinical practice as well as novel and future alternative IBD
      treatment methods.

AB  - Chronic inflammation is an underlying risk factor of colon cancer, and NF-kappaB 
      plays a critical role in the development of inflammation-associated colon cancer 
      in an AOM/DSS mouse model. The aim of this study was to determine whether the
      standardized ethanol extract obtained from the aerial parts of Artemisia princeps
      Pampanini cv. Sajabal (EAPP) is effective at preventing inflammation-associated
      colon cancer, and if so, to identify the signaling pathways involved. In the
      present study, protective efficacy of EAPP on tumor formation and the
      infiltrations of monocytes and macrophages in colons of an AOM/DSS mouse model
      were evaluated. It was found that colitis and tumor burdens showed statistically 
      meaningful improvements after EAPP administration. Furthermore, these
      improvements were accompanied by a reduction in NF-kappaB activity and in the
      levels of NF-kappaB-dependent pro-survival proteins, that is, survivin, cFLIP,
      XIAP, and Bcl-2. In vitro, EAPP significantly reduced NF-kappaB activation and
      the levels of IL-1beta and IL-8 mRNA and pro-survival proteins in HT-29 and
      HCT-116 colon cancer cells. Furthermore, EAPP caused caspase-dependent apoptosis.
      Based on these results, the authors suggest EAPP suppresses inflammatory
      responses and induces apoptosis partly via NF-kappaB inactivation, and that EAPP 
      could be useful for the prevention of colitis-associated tumorigenesis.

AB  - Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) is an important molecule in mediating
      inflammatory colitis, which can lead to colorectal cancer (CRC). The aim of this 
      study was to evaluate the chemopreventive efficacy of apple polysaccharide
      extract (AP) in inhibiting NF-kappaB-mediated inflammation pathways in CRC. We
      evaluated AP in vitro in HT-29 and SW620 human CRC cells. We also used the
      azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulphate (AOM/DSS) model to induce colon
      carcinogenesis in vivo. The chemoprotective effects of AP were assessed using
      Western blot, immunofluorescence assay, real-time PCR, electrophoretic mobility
      shift assay, and flow cytometry. AP reduced AOM/DSS-associated toxicities,
      prevented carcinogenesis, and decreased the expression of TLR4, MD2, MyD88, TRAM,
      TRIF-related adapter molecule, interferon-beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and 
      interleukin-6. The protective effects of AP may be related to the inhibition of
      TLR4/MD2-mediated signaling, including MyD88 and TRIF, as well as the inhibition 
      of NF-kappaB-mediated inflammatory signaling pathways. Therefore, AP could be
      used in combination therapy for the prevention of colitis-associated colon
      cancer.

      model of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 277-86
LID - 10.3920/BM2014.0070 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic inflammatory conditions,
      characterised by remissions and relapses episodes, whose main manifestations are 
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Ulcerative colitis (UC), one of the main 
      forms of IBD, has as standard treatment the use of corticosteroids and
      anti-inflammatory drugs. The use of antibiotics has been also reported, but the
      possible adverse effects, such as disturbance of the indigenous microbiota or
      resistance induction, should be taken into consideration, and thus the use of
      probiotics emerges as a possible alternative option of treatment. In this study, 
      the oral administration of Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis BB-02 was
      evaluated as a preventive strategy for acute experimental UC induced in female
      BALB/c mice by ingestion of 3.5% dextran sulphate sodium in drinking water during
      7 days. During this time, the daily disease activity index was evaluated, and on 
      the seventh day the animals were euthanised to collect intestines and liver for
      analysis. Treatment with the probiotic resulted in clinical improvement of the
      animals. The histological and morphometric analyses showed a reduction of lesions
      and oedema in the gut, but there was no increase in the production of mucin. The 
      dosage of secretory immunoglobulin A was significantly higher in the colitis
      group and reduced in the group treated with the probiotic. There was also a
      reduction in the inflammation of the colon, as demonstrated by a decrease in
      neutrophils infiltration, and KC/CXCL-1 levels. The intestinal permeability,
      which is typically increased during the onset of IBD, was also reduced by
      treatment with probiotic. Based on these data, it can be concluded that the
      bacterium B. infantis BB-02 has a probiotic potential for the attenuation of UC, 
      but further studies should be conducted to verify the mechanism of protective
      action of the bacterium.

AB  - Underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a
      common disorder characterized by abdominal pain associated to a change in stool
      consistency or frequency, include low-grade inflammation and intestinal
      microbiota changes. Few and disappointing data are available for prebiotics. A
      few controlled trials (RCTs) of probiotics are instead available with favourable 
      effects, although most are limited by suboptimal design and small sample size. A 
      recent report from the Rome foundation group included 32 RCTs of probiotics, most
      of which showed an overall modest improvement in symptoms, with the patients most
      benefitting from probiotics being those with predominant diarrhoea and those
      having a post-infectious IBS. A review focusing only on children with functional 
      gastrointestinal disorders concluded that probiotics are more effective than
      placebo in the treatment of patients with abdominal pain-related functional
      gastrointestinal disorders, although no effect on constipation was evident. The
      role for probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) appears logical: the
      endogenous intestinal microbiota plays a central role in their development, and
      various probiotics have been found effective in animal models of IBD. However,
      research in humans has been overall quite limited, and it would seem that after a
      phase of intense research in the first decade of this century, the pace has
      slowed down, with fewer clinical trials been published in the past 2-3 years. To 
      summarize current evidence: no probiotic has proven successful in Crohn's
      disease. In ulcerative colitis, on the other hand, data are more promising, and a
      very recent meta-analysis, that included 23 randomized controlled trials,
      concluded that there is evidence of efficacy for the probiotic mixture VSL#3 in
      helping inducing and maintaining remission, as well as in maintaining remission
      in patients with pouchitis. It is fair to state that for both IBD and IBS, more
      well-designed, rigorous, randomized clinical trials must be performed.

TI  - Polyphenolic extracts from cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) protect colonic
      myofibroblasts (CCD18Co cells) from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced
      inflammation--modulation of microRNA 126.
PG  - 146-54
LID - 10.1039/c4fo00459k [doi]
AB  - Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) is a drought tolerant crop with several agronomic
      advantages over other legumes. This study evaluated varieties from four major
      cowpea phenotypes (black, red, light brown and white) containing different
      phenolic profiles for their anti-inflammatory property on non-malignant colonic
      myofibroblasts (CCD18Co) cells challenged with an endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, 
      LPS). Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay on the LPS-stimulated
      cells revealed antioxidative potential of black and red cowpea varieties.
      Real-time qRT-PCR analysis in LPS-stimulated cells revealed down-regulation of
      proinflammatory cytokines (IL-8, TNF-alpha, VCAM-1), transcription factor
      NF-kappaB and modulation of microRNA-126 (specific post-transcriptional regulator
      of VCAM-1) by cowpea polyphenolics. The ability of cowpea polyphenols to modulate
      miR-126 signaling and its target gene VCAM-1 were studied in LPS-stimulated
      endothelial cells transfected with a specific inhibitor of miR-126, and treated
      with 10 mg GAE/L black cowpea extract where the extract in part reversed the
      effect of the miR-126 inhibitor. This suggests that cowpea may exert their
      anti-inflammatory activities at least in part through induction of miR-126 that
      then down-regulate VCAM-1 mRNA and protein expressions. Overall, Cowpea therefore
      is promising as an anti-inflammatory dietary component.

AB  - Chlorogenic acid (CHA) is an antioxidant polyphenol prevalent in human diet, with
      coffee, fruits, and vegetables being its main source. Effects of CHA and CHA
      metabolites were evaluated on the IL-8 production in human intestinal Caco-2
      cells induced by combined stimulation with tumour necrosis factor alpha
      (TNFalpha) and H2O2. CHA and caffeic acid (CA) inhibited TNFalpha- and
      H2O2-induced IL-8 production. We also examined the in vivo effects of CHA and CA 
      using dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. CHA attenuated
      DSS-induced body weight loss, diarrhea, fecal blood, and shortening of colon and 
      dramatically improved colitis histological scores. Furthermore, increases in the 
      mRNA expression of colonic macrophage inflammatory protein 2 and IL-1beta, which 
      were induced by DSS, were significantly suppressed by CHA supplementation. These 
      results suggest that dietary CHA use may aid in the prevention of intestinal
      inflammatory conditions.

TI  - Fecal microbial transplant via nasogastric tube for active pediatric ulcerative
      colitis.
PG  - 27-9
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000544 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC), a chronic inflammatory disease of the large 
      intestine, is characterized by a dysregulated immune reaction. UC is associated
      with fecal dysbiosis. Human and animal studies support the fact that the
      gastrointestinal microbiome may trigger the intestinal immune response, resulting
      in UC. Fecal microbial transplantation (FMT), by changing the gastrointestinal
      microbiome of patients with UC, may be a therapeutic option. METHODS: Four
      patients with moderate symptoms defined by the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis
      Activity Index were enrolled in a prospective, open-label study of FMT via
      nasogastric tube in pediatric UC (US Food and Drug Administration IND 14942).
      After the donor and patient evaluation, patients received FMT with follow-up
      evaluations at 2, 6, and 12 weeks after transplantation. Study subjects were
      maintained on their pretransplant medications. The Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis
      Activity Index score, C-reactive protein, and stool calprotectin were completed
      during each study visit. RESULTS: Four patients with UC were enrolled (all boys).
      Ages ranged from 13 to 16 years. Patients tolerated FMT without adverse effects. 
      None of the patients clinically improved with FMT, nor were there any significant
      changes in stool calprotectin or laboratory values, including C-reactive protein,
      albumin, and hematocrit. Three individuals received additional standard medical
      therapies before the end of the study. CONCLUSIONS: This study, although showing 
      that single-dose FMT via nasogastric tube is well tolerated in active pediatric
      UC, did not show any clinical or laboratory benefit.

      comparison to healthy controls.
PG  - 363-78
LID - 10.1007/s11136-014-0781-x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to compare the gastrointestinal (GI)
      symptoms and worry of pediatric patients with functional GI disorders (FGIDs) and
      organic GI diseases to healthy controls utilizing the Pediatric Quality of Life
      Inventory (PedsQL) Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales for patient
      self-reports ages 5-18 years and parent proxy-reports for ages 2-18 years. The
      secondary objective was to compare FGIDs and organic GI diseases to each other.
      METHODS: The PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales were completed in 
      a 9-site study by 587 pediatric patients with GI disorders and 685 parents of
      patients. Patients had physician-diagnosed GI disorders (chronic constipation,
      functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia,
      Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease). Ten
      Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales measuring Stomach Pain, Stomach Discomfort When 
      Eating, Food and Drink Limits, Trouble Swallowing, Heartburn and Reflux, Nausea
      and Vomiting, Gas and Bloating, Constipation, Blood, and Diarrhea were
      administered along with two Gastrointestinal Worry Scales. Five hundred and
      thirteen healthy children and 337 parents of healthy children completed the
      PedsQL Gastrointestinal Scales in an Internet panel survey. RESULTS: The PedsQL
      Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales distinguished between pediatric
      patients with FGIDs and organic GI diseases in comparison with healthy controls, 
      supporting known-groups validity. Patients with FGIDs reported more GI symptoms
      and worry than patients with organic GI diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The PedsQL
      Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales may be utilized as common metrics
      across pediatric patient groups with FGIDs and organic GI diseases and healthy
      samples to measure GI-specific symptoms in clinical research and practice.

AB  - It is important to have clear goals for treating inflammatory bowel disease in
      clinical practice and in research. Conventional end points for trials in
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease have been based on composite indices, such
      as the Mayo Clinic Score and the Crohn's Disease Activity Index; these indices
      incorporate symptoms, signs, and findings from laboratory tests and sometimes
      endoscopic assessments. Although definitions of clinical response and remission
      have been based on these indices for regulatory purposes, they are difficult to
      apply to practice because they are complex and not intuitive to clinicians. This 
      has caused a disconnect between clinical trials and practice. Recently, the use
      of composite indices in trials has been reevaluated in Food and Drug
      Administration-sponsored Gastroenterology Regulatory Endpoints and the
      Advancement of Therapeutics workshops due to concerns about the validity of the
      indices. Alternative measures of outcome and definitions of response are being
      developed. Patient-reported outcomes are psychometric instruments created and
      defined by patients to quantify symptoms. A combination of end points, comprising
      patient-reported outcomes and objective evaluation of inflammation by endoscopy, 
      offers a clinically meaningful and scientifically valid alternative to existing
      composite indices. Unlike composite indices, response definitions based on
      endoscopy and patient-reported outcomes can be readily applied in practice. This 
      convergence of outcome assessment in clinical trials and practice could expedite 
      implementation of "treat-to-target" algorithms, in which therapy is progressively
      intensified until a specific treatment goal is reached. This approach could
      improve patient care by reducing rates of disease-related complications, surgery,
      and hospitalization.

TI  - Gastrointestinal tract-derived pulse granulomata: clues to an underrecognized
      pseudotumor.
PG  - 84-92
LID - 10.1097/PAS.0000000000000308 [doi]
AB  - Pulse granulomata (PG) in the lung and oral pathology literature are presumed due
      to food (pulse) introduced by mucosal injury. Herein, we report the largest
      series of PG in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT): 22 resections were
      prospectively collected from 17 patients (8 men, range=28 to 85 y). All patients 
      had a history of intestinal injury/disease: diverticulitis, fistula,
      adenocarcinoma, perforation, ulcerative colitis, appendicitis, anastomotic site
      leak, and/or stent leak. Nine of 22 specimens were designated "masses"; most of
      these were clinically concerning for neoplasia. Sites of involvement included the
      small and large intestine, appendix, liver, gallbladder, mesentery, omentum,
      peritoneum, cervix, ovary, and skin. PG were typically nodular (21/22) and
      multifocal (15/22); most involved the external surface of the bowel (20/22), and 
      they ranged in size from 1.5 to 100 mm. Histologically, they contained variable
      amounts of hyaline ribbons and rings, inflammation, foreign body giant cells,
      calcifications, and food; larger lesions displayed circumferential stellate
      fibrosis (12/22). We describe 3 morphologic variants: hyaline predominant
      (mimicking amyloid), cellular predominant (mimicking spindle cell neoplasms), and
      sclerosing mesenteritis-like. All patients are alive and well at the time of
      follow-up. Histologically processed legumes showed similar structures as those
      identified in PG, providing support for an entrapped food origin. In summary, we 
      detail important clinicopathologic clues, describe the PG morphologic spectrum,
      and demonstrate how to distinguish PG from their mimics. Although PG can present 
      as clinically concerning masses, we conclude that they are pseudotumors arising
      secondary to entrapped food introduced through mucosal trauma, similar to their
      lung and oral counterparts.

TI  - Food antigen-induced immune responses in Crohn's disease patients and
      experimental colitis mice.
PG  - 394-405
LID - 10.1007/s00535-014-0981-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Crohn's disease (CD), the involvement of food antigens in immune
      responses remains unclear. The objective of this study was to detect immune
      responses against food antigens in CD patients and examine the mechanism in a
      mouse model of colitis. METHODS: We enrolled 98 CD patients, 50 ulcerative
      colitis patients, and 52 healthy controls (HCs) to compare the levels of serum
      immunoglobulin (Ig)Gs against 88 foods. The presence of serum IgGs against foods 
      was also examined in interleukin (IL)-10 knockout (KO) mice in which CD4(+) T
      cell activation by antigenic food protein was assessed. Mice transferred with
      IL-10 KO cells received diets with or without food antigens, and the development 
      of colitis was evaluated. RESULTS: The prevalence of IgGs against various foods, 
      especially vegetables, grains, and nuts, was significantly higher in CD patients 
      than in HCs. Similarly, the prevalence of IgGs against food proteins was higher
      in IL-10 KO mice than in BALB/c mice. Beta-conglycinin, identified as an
      antigenic food proteins in IL-10 KO mice, induced CD4(+) T cell production of
      interferon-gamma and IL-17 through dendritic cell antigen presentation.
      Elimination of the food antigens ameliorated the development of colitis in mice
      without altering the composition of their intestinal microbiota. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      CD colitis mice, intestinal inflammation via CD4(+) T cell hyperactivation was
      induced by food antigens associated with high serum IgG levels and was
      ameliorated by the elimination of food antigens. This disrupted immunological
      tolerance to food antigen, which might act as an exacerbating factor, remains to 
      be elucidated in CD patients.

TI  - Inflammation-Induced Downregulation of Butyrate Uptake and Oxidation Is Not
      Caused by a Reduced Gene Expression.
PG  - 418-26
LID - 10.1002/jcp.24725 [doi]
AB  - In ulcerative colitis (UC) the butyrate metabolism is impaired, leading to
      energy-deficiency in the colonic cells. The effect of inflammation on the
      butyrate metabolism was investigated. HT-29 cells were incubated with
      pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and/or IFN-gamma) for 1 and 24 h. Cells
      were additionally stimulated with butyrate to investigate its anti-inflammatory
      potential. Butyrate uptake and oxidation were measured using (14)C-labeled
      butyrate. Gene expression of the butyrate metabolism enzymes, interleukin 8
      (IL-8; inflammatory marker) and villin-1 (VIL-1; epithelial cell damage marker)
      was measured via quantitative RT-PCR. Significantly increased IL-8 expression and
      decreased VIL-1 expression after 24 h incubation with TNF-alpha and/or IFN-gamma 
      confirmed the presence of inflammation. These conditions induced a decrease of
      both butyrate uptake and oxidation, whereas the gene expression was not reduced. 
      Simultaneous incubation with butyrate counteracted the reduced butyrate
      oxidation. In contrast, 1 h incubation with TNF-alpha induced a significant
      increased IL-8 expression and decreased butyrate uptake. Incubation with
      TNF-alpha and/or IFN-gamma for 1 h did not induce cell damage nor influence
      butyrate oxidation. The inflammation-induced downregulation of the butyrate
      metabolism was not caused by a reduced gene expression, but appeared
      consequential to a decreased butyrate uptake. Increasing the luminal butyrate
      levels might have therapeutic potential in UC.

TI  - Abnormal fibre usage in UC in remission.
PG  - 562-70
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2014-307198 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Colonic fermentation in patients with UC in remission was compared
      with that in matched healthy subjects on habitual diets and when dietary fibre
      was increased. DESIGN: Fibre intake, faecal output of fibre (measured as
      non-starch polysaccharide (NSP)), starch, microbiota and fermentation products,
      and whole gut transit time (WGTT) were assessed in association with habitual diet
      and when dietary intake of wheat bran (WB)-associated fibre and high
      amylose-associated resistant starch (RS) was increased in an 8-week, randomised, 
      single-blind, cross-over study. RESULTS: Despite a tendency to lower habitual
      fibre intake in UC patients, faecal NSP and starch concentrations were threefold 
      higher than in controls, whereas concentrations of phenols and short-chain fatty 
      acids, pH and WGTT were similar. Increasing RS/WB intake was well tolerated. In
      controls (n=10), it more than doubled faecal NSP and starch excretion (p=0.002
      for both), had no effect on NSP usage and reduced WGTT (p=0.024). In UC patients 
      (n=19), high intake of RS/WB tended to normalise gut transit, but did not
      increase the proportion of NSP fermented. Increasing intake of RS/WB had little
      effect on faecal fermentation patterns or the structure of the microbiota.
      However, faeces from the UC cohort had lower proportions of Akkermansia
      muciniphila and increased diversity within Clostridium cluster XIVa compared to
      controls. CONCLUSIONS: Gut fermentation of NSP and starch is diminished in
      patients with UC. This cannot be explained by abnormal gut transit and was not
      corrected by increasing RS/WB intake, and may be due to abnormal functioning of
      the gut microbiota. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Australian New Zealand Clinical

TI  - Variable access to quality nutrition information regarding inflammatory bowel
      disease: a survey of patients and health professionals and objective examination 
      of written information.
PG  - 2501-12
LID - 10.1111/hex.12219 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) report a range of
      nutritional and dietary problems and high-quality written information should be
      available on these. There is little research investigating the availability and
      quality of such information for patients with IBD. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed
      the type and quality of written information on nutrition and diet available to
      patients with IBD and the opinions of patients and health professionals. SETTING 
      AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-two patients with IBD were recruited from a large
      gastroenterology outpatient centre in England. One hundred dietitians from across
      the United Kingdom were also recruited. METHODS: Face-to-face surveys were
      conducted with patients with IBD. Questions regarding the use, format and
      usefulness of dietary information received were probed. Dietitians were surveyed 
      regarding written dietary information used in clinical practice. Samples of
      IBD-specific dietary information used across the UK were objectively assessed
      using two validated tools. MAIN RESULTS: The majority of patients rated written
      information as 'good' or 'very good', with the most useful information relating
      to 'general diet and IBD'. Forty-nine (49%) dietitians reported gaps in written
      information available for patients with IBD. Fifty-three different samples of
      IBD-specific information sheets were returned, with widely variable objective
      quality ratings. Commercially produced written information scored greater than
      locally produced information (BMA tool, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patient access to
      high-quality, written, IBD-specific dietary information is variable. IBD-specific
      written nutrition information needs to be developed in accordance with validated 
      tools to empower patients, encourage self-management and overcome nutritional
      implications of IBD.

PG  - e68-70
LID - 10.1097/IOP.0000000000000081 [doi]
AB  - Ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody to cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4, a
      negative regulator of T-cell-mediated immune response. Ipilimumab is approved by 
      the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of advanced melanoma.
      However, its use frequently has been associated with immune-related side effects,
      which can be explained by its mechanism of action. More common adverse effects
      include dermatitis, colitis, hepatitis, and endocrinopathies, but many less
      common immune-related adverse effects that involve various tissues and organ
      systems have been reported with more widespread use of ipilimumab since its
      approval in 2011. A case of bilateral orbital inflammatory syndrome secondary to 
      ipilimumab, in a patient undergoing adjuvant treatment for metastatic melanoma,
      is reported.

TI  - Faecal metabolite profiling identifies medium-chain fatty acids as discriminating
      compounds in IBD.
PG  - 447-58
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2013-306423 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteria play a role in the onset and perpetuation of intestinal
      inflammation in IBD. Compositional alterations may also change the metabolic
      capacities of the gut bacteria. OBJECTIVE: To examine the metabolic activity of
      the microbiota of patients with Crohn's disease (CD), UC or pouchitis compared
      with healthy controls (HC) and determine whether eventual differences might be
      related to the pathogenesis of the disease. METHODS: Faecal samples were obtained
      from 40 HC, 83 patients with CD, 68 with UC and 13 with pouchitis. Disease
      activity was assessed in CD using the Harvey-Bradshaw Index, in UC using the UC
      Disease Activity Index and in pouchitis using the Pouchitis Disease Activity
      Index. Metabolite profiles were analysed using gas chromatography-mass
      spectrometry. RESULTS: The number of metabolites identified in HC (54) was
      significantly higher than in patients with CD (44, p<0.001), UC (47, p=0.042) and
      pouchitis (43, p=0.036). Multivariate discriminant analysis predicted HC, CD, UC 
      and pouchitis group membership with high sensitivity and specificity. The levels 
      of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs: pentanoate, hexanoate, heptanoate, octanoate 
      and nonanoate), and of some protein fermentation metabolites, were significantly 
      decreased in patients with CD, UC and pouchitis. Hexanoate levels were inversely 
      correlated to disease activity in CD (correlation coefficient=-0.157, p=0.046),
      whereas a significant positive correlation was found between styrene levels and
      disease activity in UC (correlation coefficient=0.338, p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS:
      Faecal metabolic profiling in patients with IBD relative to healthy controls
      identified MCFAs as important metabolic biomarkers of disease-related changes.

TI  - Immunological alteration and changes of gut microbiota after dextran sulfate
      sodium (DSS) administration in mice.
PG  - 107-20
LID - 10.1007/s10238-013-0270-5 [doi]
AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) is characterized by chronic inflammation of the colonic
      mucosa. Administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to animals is a frequently
      used model to mimic human colitis. Deregulation of the immune response to the
      enteric microflora or pathogens as well as increased intestinal permeability have
      been proposed as disease-driving mechanisms. To enlarge the understanding of the 
      pathogenesis, we have studied the effect of DSS on the immune system and gut
      microbiota in mice. Intestinal inflammation was verified through histological
      evaluation and myeloperoxidase activity. Immunological changes were assessed by
      flow cytometry in spleen, Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes and through 
      multiplex cytokine profiling. In addition, quantification of the total amount of 
      bacteria on colonic mucosa as well as the total amount of lactobacilli,
      Akkermansia, Desulfovibrio and Enterobacteriaceae was performed by the use of
      quantitative PCR. Diversity and community structure were analysed by terminal
      restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) patterns, and principal
      component analysis was utilized on immunological and T-RFLP patterns. DSS-induced
      colitis show clinical and histological similarities to UC. The composition of the
      colonic microflora was profoundly changed and correlated with several alterations
      of the immune system. The results demonstrate a relationship between multiple
      immunological changes and alterations of the gut microbiota after DSS
      administration. These data highlight and improve the definition of the
      immunological basis of the disease and suggest a role for dysregulation of the
      gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of colitis.
