AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) encompassed several chronic inflammatory
      disorders leading to damage of the gastrointestinal tract (GI). The 2 principal
      forms of these disorders are ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD).
      Bacteria are involved in the etiology of IBD, and the genetic susceptibility,
      environmental factors, and lifestyle factors can affect the individual's
      predisposition to IBD. The review discusses the potential role of environmental
      factors such as diet and microbiota as well as genetics in the etiology of IBD.
      It is suggested that microbial ecosystem in the human bowel colonizing the gut in
      many different microhabitats can be influence by diet, leading to formation of
      metabolic processes that are essential form the bowel metabolism.

TI  - Management of inflammatory bowel disease with vitamin D: beyond bone health.
PG  - 397-404
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2011.10.015 [doi]
AB  - A relationship between vitamin D and several disorders, including Crohn's disease
      (CD), has recently been proposed. Vitamin D appears to have several important
      actions beyond the maintenance of bone health, including various effects on the
      immune system. Vitamin D deficiency has been implicated in the development of CD,
      and its analogues may have a role in the treatment of CD. Current research also
      suggests a role for vitamin D in counteracting some IBD-specific complications,
      including osteopenia, colorectal neoplasia, and depression. There remains a need 
      for prospective studies to further delineate these relationships. Given current
      evidence and the apparent safety of vitamin D supplementation, it appears
      reasonable to screen for and treat vitamin D deficiency in patients with IBD.

TI  - Vitamin D deficiency in Crohn's disease: prevalence, risk factors and supplement 
      use in an outpatient setting.
PG  - 182-8
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2011.08.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Vitamin D deficiency impacts on bone health and has
      potential new roles in inflammation. We aimed to determine the prevalence of and 
      risk factors for vitamin D deficiency and to explore vitamin D supplement usage
      in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) in an outpatient setting, compared with
      controls. METHODS: Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations were
      measured by radioimmunoassay in 151 participants, comprising 81 CD patients and
      70 age-, sex- and socio-economic status-matched healthy controls. Levels of
      25(OH)D <50 nmol/L were classed as deficient. Data on vitamin supplement usage
      were recorded for all participants at interview. RESULTS: Vitamin D deficiency
      was common in patients with CD (63%) and significantly higher in winter than
      summer (68% v 50%; p<0.001, chi(2)). Notably, the deficiency rate remained high
      even in summer (50%). On regression analysis, 25(OH)D levels were inversely
      associated with winter season. Disease-specific factors for lower serum 25(OH)D
      levels were longer disease duration and smoking. Overall, 43% of patients
      reported using a vitamin D-containing supplement, primarily at low dosages
      (200-400 IU/d); however, this level of supplement did not prevent deficiency. For
      the majority of CD patients, 25(OH)D remained below optimal levels proposed to
      confer bone and immune health benefits. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency was
      common in patients with CD and associated with longstanding disease, smoking and 
      winter. While over 40% of patients used a vitamin D-containing supplement, the
      dosages were inadequate to prevent deficiency. Appropriate vitamin D screening
      and supplementation should be considered in the context of health promotion of
      outpatients with CD.

TI  - Probiotics in inflammatory bowel diseases and associated conditions.
PG  - 245-64
LID - 10.3390/nu3020245 [doi]
AB  - A complex set of interactions between the human genes encoding innate protective 
      functions and immune defenses and the environment of the intestinal mucosa with
      its microbiota is currently considered key to the pathogenesis of the chronic
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Probiotics offer a method to potentially alter
      the intestinal microbiome exogenously or may provide an option to deliver
      microbial metabolic products to alter the chronicity of intestinal mucosal
      inflammation characterizing IBD. At present, there is little evidence for the
      benefit of currently used probiotic microbes in Crohn's disease or associated
      conditions affecting extra-intestinal organs. However, clinical practice
      guidelines are now including a probiotic as an option for recurrent and relapsing
      antibiotic sensitive pouchitis and the use of probiotics in mild ulcerative
      colitis is provocative and suggests potential for benefit in select patients but 
      concerns remain about proof from trials.

TI  - Effect of lactobacilli on paracellular permeability in the gut.
PG  - 104-17
LID - 10.3390/nu3010104 [doi]
AB  - Paracellular permeability is determined by the complex structures of junctions
      that are located between the epithelial cells. Already in 1996, it was shown that
      the human probiotic strain Lactobacillus plantarum 299v and the rat-originating
      strain Lactobacillus reuteri R2LC could reduce this permeability in a
      methotrexate-induced colitis model in the rat. Subsequently, many animal models
      and cell culture systems have shown indications that lactobacilli are able to
      counteract increased paracellular permeability evoked by cytokines, chemicals,
      infections, or stress. There have been few human studies focusing on the effect
      of lactobacilli on intestinal paracellular permeability but recently it has been 
      shown that they could influence the tight junctions. More precisely, short-term
      administration of L. plantarum WCSF1 to healthy volunteers increased the
      relocation of occludin and ZO-1 into the tight junction area between duodenal
      epithelial cells.

TI  - [Protective effect of purslane in a rat model of ulcerative colitis].
PG  - 2727-30
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the protective effect of purslane on the acute injury
      caused by intra-colonic administration of trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) in 
      rats. METHOD: Seventy-two male SD rats were separated into 6 groups randomly. Rat
      model of ulcerative colitis was established by intra-colonic administration of
      trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS). Purslane (2.5, 5, 10 g x kg(-1)) and
      sulfasalazine(0.5 g x kg(-1)) was administered by enemata, 3 days after TNBS
      instillation and daily during 10 days before killing the rats. Colons were
      removed for histological analysis and measurement of myeloperoxidase (MPO).
      RESULT: Rats treated with purslane (5 and 10 g x kg(-1)) were significantly
      healthier than TNBS-alone rats, as shown by improved food intake and reduced

      significantly reduced myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels. CONCLUSION: purslane exerts
      protective effect in experimental colitis, the effect seems to be related to
      relieving inflammatory reaction and repairing lesions.

TI  - Tumour necrosis factor-alpha expression in segmental colitis associated with
      diverticulosis down-regulates after treatment.
PG  - 365-70
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) expression may be
      increased in segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis (SCAD). Our aim was
      to assess TNF-alpha expression in SCAD in relationship to the treatment. METHODS:
      10 patients affected by severe (type B and D) SCAD were studied (6 males, 4
      females, mean age 60.54 years, range 43-85 years). All patients were treated with
      beclomethasone dipropionate 10 mg/day plus a probiotic preparation VSL#3 for 8
      weeks. At that time, clinical, endoscopic and histological reassessment was
      performed. Controls were 5 patients with active ulcerative colitis (UC). RESULTS:
      After treatment, all SCAD B and no SCAD D patients were in remission. The
      TNF-alpha expression dropped from 42.7% (+/-7.58) to 15.7% (+/-2.6) in SCAD B
      patients (p=0.001), and from 40% (+/-5.9) to 28.6% (+/-5.3) in SCAD D patients
      (p=0.005). In UC patients, the TNF-alpha expression dropped from 45.5% (+/-5.09) 
      to 22.5% (+/-2.5) (p=0.001). Neither SCAD B nor SCAD D patients showed a
      significant difference in TNF-alpha expression compared to UC after treatment.
      Finally, TNF-alpha was significantly overexpressed in SCAD D than in SCAD B at
      the end of treatment (p=0.048). CONCLUSIONS: TNF-alpha expression in SCAD down
      regulates after treatment, and seems to be related to the clinical response to
      therapy. This behaviour, similar to that of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD),
      confirms that this disease should be considered as a subtype of IBD.

TI  - Glucans from the edible mushroom Pleurotus pulmonarius inhibit colitis-associated
      colon carcinogenesis in mice.
PG  - 504-18
LID - 10.1007/s00535-011-0514-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We have recently demonstrated that polysaccharides from fruiting body
      extract (FBE) or mycelia extract (ME) of the edible mushroom Pleurotus
      pulmonarius exert antiproliferative effects in intestinal cells and an
      anti-inflammatory effect in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse model of acute
      colitis. The aim of this study was to assess the role of fungal FBE and ME in
      colon carcinogenesis. METHODS: In vitro, human colorectal cancer cells were
      treated with FBE and ME and analyzed for inflammation response, for markers of
      apoptosis, and for cell-cycle progression. In vivo, FBE and ME were tested in a
      mouse model of colitis-associated colorectal carcinogenesis induced by cyclic
      treatments with DSS and azoxymethane. Treated mice were fed a daily diet
      containing 2 or 20 mg FBE or ME per mouse for 80 days. RESULTS: In vitro, FBE and
      ME induced apoptosis in a dose-responsive manner and modulated the expression of 
      Bcl-2, Bax, and cytochrome c, and blocked tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF)-alpha-induced inhibitor of nuclear factor (NF) (Ikappa)-Balpha degradation 
      and NF-kappaB nuclear translocation. In vivo, dietary administration of FBE and
      ME significantly reduced the formation of aberrant crypt foci, which precedes
      colorectal cancer, and of microadenomas. The treatments significantly lowered the
      expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and increased the number of
      cells undergoing apoptosis in the colon. Additionally, FBE and ME inhibited the
      expression of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha in colonic tissue.
      CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that P. pulmonarius FBE and ME inhibit
      colitis-associated colon carcinogenesis induced in mice through the modulation of
      cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and inhibition of inflammation.

LID - 10.1159/000332981 [doi]
AB  - Bacteria play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD), its complications and its symptoms. Antibiotics can decrease tissue
      invasion and eliminate aggressive bacterial species. They are used in IBD to
      treat infective complications and for altering bacterial flora, which may result 
      in specific anti-inflammatory effects. In addition, suppression of bacterial
      metabolic activities or direct effects of antibiotics on intestinal structures
      and functions may result in symptoms which cannot be differentiated from symptoms
      caused by inflammation. Although current clinical trials do not fulfill criteria 
      of evidence-based treatment, a few placebo- or standard treatment-controlled
      studies suggest that metronidazole and ciprofloxacin are effective in Crohn's
      colitis and ileocolitis, perianal fistulae and pouchitis. Administration of
      probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics can restore a predominance of beneficial
      species. However, beneficial effects of probiotics in IBD are modest,
      strain-specific and limited to certain manifestations of disease and duration of 
      use of the probiotic. For probiotics there is reasonable evidence of efficacy in 
      relapse prevention in chronic pouchitis and ulcerative colitis, and suggestive
      evidence for postoperative prevention in pouchitis. Therapeutic manipulation of
      the intestinal flora offers considerable promise for treating IBD, but must be
      supported by large controlled therapeutic trials before widespread clinical
      acceptance. These agents may become a component of treating IBD in combination
      with traditional anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents. Probiotic
      strategies, based on metagenomic or metabonomic analyses, and new classes of
      probiotics might play an important role in the future management of IBD.

TI  - Probiotics for maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - CD007443
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD007443.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis is a chronic relapsing disease characterised by
      diffuse mucosal inflammation limited to the colon. Current maintenance treatments
      have multiple adverse events and an effective treatment with minimal adverse
      events is desired. Several studies have demonstrated the importance of intestinal
      flora in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. It has been suggested that
      modifying the bacterial flora with probiotics may attenuate the inflammatory
      process and prevent relapses in ulcerative colitis. OBJECTIVES: The primary
      objectives were to determine the efficacy and safety of probiotics for the
      maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis. SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane
      Central Register of Controlled Tials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1966 to July 2011),
      EMBASE (1974 to July 2011), CINAHL (1982 to July 2011) and the Cochrane
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Functional Bowel Disorders Group Specialised Trial
      Register were searched. Manufacturers of probiotics were contacted to identify
      any unpublished trials. References of trials were also searched for any
      additional trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that
      compared probiotics against placebo or any other intervention for the maintenance
      of remission in ulcerative colitis were eligible for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION
      AND ANALYSIS: Data extraction and assessment of methodological quality of
      included studies were independently performed by two authors. The main outcome
      measure was the occurrence of clinical or endoscopic relapse. MAIN RESULTS: Four 
      studies (n = 587) met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review.
      Three trials compared probiotics to mesalazine and one trial compared probiotics 
      with placebo. The studies ranged in length from 3 to 12 months. The risk of bias 
      was high in two studies due to incomplete outcome data and lack of blinding. The 
      methods used for allocation concealment were unclear for all four studies. There 
      was no statistically significant difference between probiotics and mesalazine for
      maintenance of remission in UC. Relapse was reported in 40.1% of patients in the 
      probiotics group compared to 34.1% of patients in the mesalazine group (3
      studies; 555 patients: OR 1.33; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.90 ; I(2) = 11%). There was no
      statistically significant difference in the incidence of adverse events.
      Twenty-six per cent of patients in the probiotics group experienced at least one 
      adverse event compared to 24% of patients in the mesalazine group (2 studies; 430
      patients OR 1.21; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.84; I(2) =27%). Adverse events reported in the
      mesalazine-controlled studies include diarrhea, mucous secretion, bloody stools, 
      abdominal pain, flatulence and distension, nausea and vomiting and headache. A
      small placebo controlled trial (n = 32) found no statistically significant
      difference in efficacy. Seventy-five per cent of probiotic patients relapsed at
      one year compared to 92% of placebo patients (OR 0.27; 95% CI 0.03 to 2.68).
      Adverse events reported in the placebo-controlled study include flatulence,
      abdominal bloating and pain, changes in faecal consistency, arthralgia,
      sacroiliitis, tiredness, incontinence, stress, oral blisters, eye dryness,
      headache, dizziness, influenza, gastroenteritis, cystitis and pneumonia. AUTHORS'
      CONCLUSIONS: Given the relatively small number of patients in the pooled
      analysis, the small number of events and the high risk and unclear risk of bias
      in the included studies, there is insufficient evidence to make conclusions about
      the efficacy of probiotics for maintenance of remission in UC. There is a lack of
      well-designed RCTs in this area and further research is needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intestinal microbiota manipulation, one of the pathogenetic
      components of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), has become an attractive therapy 
      for ulcerative colitis (UC). AIM: To assess in children with active distal UC the
      effectiveness of Lactobacillus (L) reuteri ATCC 55730 enema on inflammation and
      cytokine expression of rectal mucosa. METHODS: A total of 40 patients (median
      age: 7.2 years range 6-18) with mild to moderate UC were enrolled in a
      prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled study. They received an enema
      solution containing 10(10) CFU of L. reuteri ATCC 55730 or placebo for 8 weeks,
      in addition to oral mesalazine. Clinical endoscopic and histological scores as
      well as rectal mucosal expression levels of IL-10, IL-1beta, TNFalpha and IL-8
      were evaluated at the beginning and at the end of the trial. RESULTS: Thirty-one 
      patients accomplished the trial (17 males, median age 13 year, range 7-18). Mayo 
      score (including clinical and endoscopic features) decreased significantly in the
      L. reuteri group (3.2 +/- 1.3 vs. 8.6 +/- 0.8, P < 0.01) compared with placebo
      (7.1 +/- 1.1 vs. 8.7 +/- 0.7, NS); furthermore, histological score significantly 
      decrease only in the L. reuteri group (0.6 +/- 0.5 vs. 4.5 +/- 0.6, P < 0.01)
      (placebo: 2.9 +/- 0.8 vs. 4.6 +/- 0.6, NS). At the post-trial evaluation of
      cytokine mucosal expression levels, IL-10 significantly increased (P < 0.01)
      whereas IL-1beta, TNFalpha and IL-8 significantly decreased (P < 0.01) only in
      the L. reuteri group. CONCLUSIONS: In children with active distal ulcerative
      colitis, rectal infusion of L. reuteri is effective in improving mucosal
      inflammation and changing mucosal expression levels of some cytokines involved in
      the mechanisms of inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - The potential for probiotic manipulation of the gastrointestinal microbiome.
PG  - 192-201

AB  - Multiple internal and external sites of the healthy human body are colonized by a
      diversity of symbiotic microbes. The microbial assemblages found in the intestine
      represent some of the most dense and diverse of these human-associated
      ecosystems. Unsurprisingly, the enteric microbiome, that is the totality of
      microbes, their combined genomes, and their interactions with the human body, has
      a profound impact on physiological aspects of mammalian function, not least, host
      immune response. Lack of early-life exposure to certain microbes, or shifts in
      the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiome have been linked to the
      development and progression of several intestinal and extra-intestinal diseases, 
      including childhood asthma development and inflammatory bowel disease. Modulating
      microbial exposure through probiotic supplementation represents a long-held
      strategy towards ameliorating disease via intestinal microbial community
      restructuring. This field has experienced somewhat of a resurgence over the past 
      few years, primarily due to the exponential increase in human microbiome studies 
      and a growing appreciation of our dependence on resident microbiota to modulate
      human health. This review aims to review recent regulatory aspects related to
      probiotics in food. It also summarizes what is known to date with respect to
      human gastrointestinal microbiota - the niche which has been most extensively
      studied in the human system - and the evidence for probiotic supplementation as a
      viable therapeutic strategy for modulating this consortium.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotic bacteria can be used for the prevention and treatment of
      human inflammatory diseases including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). However,
      the nature of active components and exact mechanisms of this beneficial effects
      have not been fully elucidated. Our aim was to investigate if lysate of probiotic
      bacterium L. casei DN-114 001 (Lc) could decrease the severity of intestinal
      inflammation in a murine model of IBD. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The
      preventive effect of oral administration of Lc significantly reduces the severity
      of acute dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis in BALB/c but not in SCID mice. In 
      order to analyze how this beneficial effect interferes with well-known phases of 
      intestinal inflammation pathogenesis in vivo and in vitro, we evaluated
      intestinal permeability using the FITC-labeled dextran method and analysed tight 
      junction proteins expression by immunofluorescence and PCR. We also measured
      CD4(+)FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells proportion by FACS analysis, microbiota
      composition by pyrosequencing, and local cytokine production by ELISA. Lc leads
      to a significant protection against increased intestinal permeability and barrier
      dysfunction shown by preserved ZO-1 expression. We found that the Lc treatment
      increases the numbers of CD4(+)FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells in mesenteric lymph
      nodes (MLN), decreases production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and
      IFN-gamma, and anti-inflammatory IL-10 in Peyer's patches and large intestine,
      and changes the gut microbiota composition. Moreover, Lc treatment prevents
      lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF-alpha expression in RAW 264.7 cell line by
      down-regulating the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our
      study provided evidence that even non-living probiotic bacteria can prevent the
      development of severe forms of intestinal inflammation by strengthening the
      integrity of intestinal barrier and modulation of gut microenvironment.

TI  - Relevance of protein fermentation to gut health.
PG  - 184-96
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201100542 [doi]
AB  - It is generally accepted that carbohydrate fermentation results in beneficial
      effects for the host because of the generation of short chain fatty acids,
      whereas protein fermentation is considered detrimental for the host's health.
      Protein fermentation mainly occurs in the distal colon, when carbohydrates get
      depleted and results in the production of potentially toxic metabolites such as
      ammonia, amines, phenols and sulfides. However, the effectivity of these
      metabolites has been established mainly in in vitro studies. In addition, some
      important bowel diseases such as colorectal cancer (CRC) and ulcerative colitis
      appear most often in the distal colon, which is the primary site of protein
      fermentation. Finally, epidemiological studies revealed that diets rich in meat
      are associated with the prevalence of CRC, as is the case in Western society.
      Importantly, meat intake not only increases fermentation of proteins but also
      induces increased intake of fat, heme and heterocyclic amines, which may also
      play a role in the development of CRC. Despite these indications, the
      relationship between gut health and protein fermentation has not been thoroughly 
      investigated. In this review, the existing evidence about the potential toxicity 
      of protein fermentation from in vitro animal and human studies will be
      summarized.

      attitudes and prescribing practices of gastroenterologists and surgeons.
PG  - 489-96
LID - 10.1111/j.1751-2980.2011.00534.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Probiotics are increasingly advocated in the management of various
      gastrointestinal disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the current 
      attitudes and prescribing practices of surgeons and gastroenterologists for
      probiotics in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. METHODS: A
      questionnaire was designed to look at the frequency of probiotic prescribing,
      types of probiotics used, indications for and duration of treatment and
      clinicians' experiences with probiotic use. A total of 220 questionnaires were
      mailed to consultant gastroenterologists and surgeons practicing in the UK.
      RESULTS: The overall response rate was 80.5%, of which 69.5% of respondents said 
      they recommended or prescribed probiotic food supplements to their patients,
      including 53.4% of surgeons and 80.8% of gastroenterologists (P = 0.00013). The
      most popular probiotic supplements among surgeons were probiotic-containing
      yoghurt and drinks (79.5% and 71.8%, respectively), whereas VSL#3 was more
      popular with gastroenterologists (83.3%). The most popular indications were
      irritable bowel syndrome (70.7% of prescribers) and pouchitis (67.5% of
      prescribers). Many respondents prescribed long-term probiotics. Most consultants 
      had been prescribing probiotics for a period of 1 to 5 years. CONCLUSION:
      Probiotics are popular among gastroenterologists and surgeons in the UK for the
      treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. Further evidence to support their
      routine use, by way of large, well-designed randomized controlled trials, is
      necessary.

LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2011.05.010 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of environmental factors in development of inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) remains uncertain. The aim of the present study was to assess
      a number of formerly suggested environmental factors in a case-control study of
      an unselected and recently diagnosed group of patients with IBD and a control
      group of orthopaedic patients. METHODS: A total of 123 patients diagnosed with
      Crohn's disease (CD) and 144 with ulcerative colitis (UC) in Copenhagen
      (2003-2004) were matched 1:1 on age and gender to 267 orthopaedic controls.
      Participants received a questionnaire with 87 questions concerning environmental 
      factors prior to IBD/orthopaedic admission. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated by
      logistic regression. RESULTS: Being breastfed >6 months (OR, 0.50; 95% CI,
      0.23-1.11) and undergoing tonsillectomy (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.31-0.78) decreased
      the odds for IBD, whereas appendectomy decreased the odds for UC only (OR, 0.29; 
      95% CI, 0.12-0.71). Vaccination against pertussis (OR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.07-4.03)
      and polio (OR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.04-5.43) increased the odds for IBD, whereas
      measles infection increased the odds for UC (OR, 3.50; 95% CI, 1.15-10.6). Low
      consumption of fibres and high consumption of sugar were significantly associated
      with development of CD and UC. Smoking increased the risk for CD and protected
      against UC. CONCLUSION: Among Danish patients with CD and UC belonging to an
      unselected cohort, disease occurrence was found to be associated both with
      well-known factors such as smoking and appendectomy, and with more debated
      factors including breastfeeding, tonsillectomy, childhood vaccinations, childhood
      infections, and dietary intake of fibres and sugar.

      patients with Crohn's disease before and after re-initiation of infliximab. ELISA
      assay was employed to measure infliximab level in maternal serum and in breast
      milk. The level of infliximab was also measured in breast milk of a control group
      of 8 nursing healthy mothers. RESULTS: Infliximab was undetectable in breast milk
      prior to the first infusion and was also not measurable in 8 lactating women not 
      exposed to infliximab. Infliximab levels in breast milk rose up to 101ng/ml
      within 2-3days of the infusion. These levels of infliximab in breast milk were
      roughly 1/200th of the level in blood. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast with prior
      reports, infliximab can be detected in the breast milk of nursing mothers. The
      miniscule amounts of infliximab transferred in breast milk are unlikely to result
      in systemic immune-suppression of the infant. Nonetheless, local effects of this 
      exposure on the neonates' intestine and potential immune sensitization or
      tolerization towards the drug can not be excluded and merit further
      investigations.

AB  - Probiotics can play a role in enhancing intestinal barrier function. However, the
      underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. The aim of this study was to
      examine the effects of VSL#3 probiotics on colonic epithelium permeability, tight
      junction protein expression and MAPKs signaling pathways in vivo and in vitro. In
      vivo, acute colitis was induced by administration of 3.5% dextran sodium sulfate 
      for 7 days. Rats in two groups were treated with either 15 mg VSL#3 or placebo
      via a gastric tube once daily after induction of colitis. Tight junction protein 
      expression and the MAPKs signaling pathways were studied by immunohistochemistry 
      and immunoblotting. In vitro, HT-29 cells were exposed to TNF-alpha for up to 48 
      h with or without pre-treatment with a p38 MAPK inhibitor, an ERK inhibitor or a 
      JNK inhibitor. Then tight junction proteins and the phosphorylation of MAPKs were
      examined in the presence or absence of VSL#3. In vivo, VSL#3 probiotics
      significantly ameliorated the disease activity index from Day 4 onward. In acute 
      colitis rats, decreased expression of the tight junction proteins were observed, 
      whereas VSL#3 therapy prevented these changes and increased the expression of
      phosphorylated p38 (P-p38), and of phosphorylated ERK (P-ERK). In vitro, tight
      junction proteins, P-p38 and P-ERK in the VSL#3 group were significantly higher
      than in the control and TNF-alpha groups. The p38 MAPK inhibitor and the ERK
      inhibitor could effectively prevent this effect. VSL#3 probiotics protected the
      epithelial barrier and increased the tight junction protein expression in vivo
      and in vitro by activating the p38 and ERK signaling pathways.

AB  - Escherichia coli O157:H7 is a significant human pathogen which has mostly
      foodborne and waterborne modes of transmission. Although capable of infecting
      several hosts, the main source of this bacterium is cattle. In humans, it mainly 
      causes hemorrhagic colitis, bloody diarrhea, and hemolytic uremic syndrome. This 
      bacterial pathogen is fairly resistant to various stresses and can survive for
      significant periods of time in the environment outside of a host. Some of the
      factors impacting its survival include the indigenous microbial communities, its 
      ability to attach to food contact surfaces and form biofilms, temperature, and
      dehydration. To address the public health concerns associated with this pathogen,
      several disinfection and sanitization procedures and technologies have been
      developed in recent years. Synergies between different procedures have been
      evaluated as well. This review addresses recent developments regarding the
      survival and disinfection of E. coli O157:H7.

TI  - Molecular signature of kappa-carrageenan mimics chondroitin-4-sulfate and
      dermatan sulfate and enables interaction with arylsulfatase B.
PG  - 1058-63
LID - 10.1016/j.jnutbio.2011.05.012 [doi]
AB  - The common food additive kappa-carrageenan (kappa-CGN) is a sulfated
      polysaccharide that resembles chondroitin-4-sulfate (C4S) and dermatan sulfate
      (DS). All have a sulfate group on C4 of a glycoside (galactose for CGN and
      N-acetylgalactosamine for C4S), and the sulfate-bearing glycoside is linked in a 
      beta-1,4-configuration to an unsulfated, six-carbon sugar (galactose for CGN,
      glucuronate for C4S and iduronate for DS). The enzyme arylsulfatase B (ARSB;
      N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfate) is the highly selective enzyme that removes the 
      four-sulfate group from the nonreducing terminus of C4S and DS, thereby
      regulating subsequent degradation. In this report, kappa-CGN is shown to be a
      substrate for recombinant human ARSB (rhARSB). Sulfate was generated from both
      C4S and kappa-CGN following incubation with rhARSB. Exposure of human colonic
      epithelial cells to kappa-CGN, but not to C4S, produced reactive oxygen species
      (ROS) and increased interleukin (IL)-8 secretion. The ROS production from
      kappa-CGN was reduced by exposure to rhARSB, but increased by competition from
      C4S or DS, but not from chondroitin-6-sulfate. Prior treatment of either lambda- 
      or iota-CGN with rhARSB had no impact on ROS, IL-8 or inorganic sulfate
      production, demonstrating a specific effect of the molecular configuration of
      kappa-CGN. By mimicry of C4S and DS and by interaction with ARSB, kappa-CGN can
      directly interfere with the normal cellular functions of C4S, DS and ARSB. Since 
      C4S and DS are present in high concentration in tissues, the impact of kappa-CGN 
      exposure may be due to some extent to interference with the normal biological
      functions of ARSB, C4S and DS.

      Escherichia coli (EHEC) serogroup O26, O103, O111, O118, O121, O145 and O157
      strains and the aggregative EHEC O104:H4 strain from ready-to-eat vegetables.

LID - 10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2011.10.009 [doi]
AB  - Human infections with Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli strains (EHEC) as
      agents of Haemorrhagic Colitis (HC) and Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome (HUS) are
      frequently associated with the consumption of EHEC contaminated foodstuffs of
      different origins. EHEC O26, O103, O111, O118, O121, O145 and O157 strains are
      responsible for the majority of HC and HUS cases worldwide. In May 2011, the
      emerging aggregative EHEC O104:H4 strain caused a large outbreak with high HUS
      incidence in northern Germany. Contaminated sprouted seeds were suspected to be
      the vehicles of transmission. The examination of vegetables retailed for raw
      consumption revealed low numbers of E. coli (<100 cfu/g) together with high
      titres of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas (approx. 5.6 x 10(7) cfu/g).
      Specific methods of EHEC detection adapted to vegetables are not yet published.
      Therefore, we have developed a rapid and sensitive method for detecting low EHEC 
      contamination in vegetables (1-10 cfu/25 g) with artificially EHEC contaminated
      ready-to-eat salads. A 6-hour enrichment period in BRILA-broth was sufficient to 
      detect 1-10 EHEC from spiked samples after plating 0.1 ml portions of enrichment 
      culture on selective TBX-agar and CHROMagar STEC plates that were incubated at 44
      degrees C overnight. Unlike EHEC strains, the growth of bacteria of the plant
      flora was substantially inhibited at 44 degrees C. DNA for real-time PCR
      detection of EHEC characteristic genes (stx(1), stx(2), eae, ehxA, and O-antigen 
      associated) was prepared with bacteria grown on TBX-agar plates. The storage of
      EHEC inoculated salad samples for 72 h at 6 degrees C resulted in a significant
      reduction (mean value 14.6%) of detectable EHEC, suggesting interference of EHEC 
      with the resident plant microflora. CHROMagar STEC was evaluated as a selective
      medium for the detection of EHEC strains. Growth on CHROMagar STEC was closely
      associated with EHEC O26:[H11], O111:[H8], O118:H16, O121:[H19], O145:[H28],
      O157:[H7] and aggregative EHEC O104:H4 strains and with the presence of the terB 
      gene (tellurite resistance). TerB sequences were found in 87.2% of 235 EHEC but
      only in only 12.5% of 567 non-EHEC strains. EHEC strains which did not grow on
      CHROMagar STEC were negative for terB as frequently observed with EHEC O103:H2
      (52.9%) and sorbitol-fermenting O157:NM strains (100%). The enrichment and
      detection method was applied in the examination of sprouted seeds incriminated as
      vehicles in the EHEC O104:H4 outbreak in Germany. Aggregative EHEC O104:H4 could 
      be detected and isolated from a sample of sprouted seeds which was suspected as
      vector of transmission of EHEC O104 to humans.

TI  - Diet and risk of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 185-94
LID - 10.1016/j.dld.2011.10.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A better understanding of the environmental factors leading to
      inflammatory bowel disease should help to prevent occurrence of the disease and
      its relapses. AIM: To review current knowledge on dietary risk factors for
      inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: The PubMed, Medline and Cochrane Library
      were searched for studies on diet and risk of inflammatory bowel disease.
      RESULTS: Established non-diet risk factors include family predisposition,
      smoking, appendectomy, and antibiotics. Retrospective case-control studies are
      encumbered with methodological problems. Prospective studies on European cohorts,
      mainly including middle-aged adults, suggest that a diet high in protein from
      meat and fish is associated with a higher risk of inflammatory bowel disease.
      Intake of the n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid may confer risk of
      ulcerative colitis, whereas n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may be protective. No
      effect was found of intake of dietary fibres, sugar, macronutrients, total
      energy, vitamin C, D, E, Carotene, or Retinol (vitamin A) on risk of ulcerative
      colitis. No prospective data was found on risk related to intake of fruits,
      vegetables or food microparticles (titanium dioxide and aluminium silicate).
      CONCLUSIONS: A diet high in protein, particular animal protein, may be associated
      with increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease and relapses. N-6
      polyunsaturated fatty acids may predispose to ulcerative colitis whilst n-3
      polyunsaturated fatty acid may protect. These results should be confirmed in
      other countries and in younger subjects before dietary counselling is recommended
      in high risk subjects.

TI  - Loop-mediated isothermal amplification assays for detecting shiga toxin-producing
      Escherichia coli in ground beef and human stools.
PG  - 91-7
LID - 10.1128/JCM.05612-11 [doi]
AB  - Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), encompassing E. coli O157 and
      non-O157 STEC, is a significant cause of food-borne illnesses and deaths in the
      United States and worldwide. Shiga toxins (encoded by stx) and intimin (encoded
      by eae) are important virulence factors for STEC strains linked to severe human
      illnesses such as hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic-uremic syndrome. In this
      study, the stx(1), stx(2), and eae genes were chosen as targets to design
      loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays for the rapid, specific,
      sensitive, and quantitative detection of STEC strains. The assay performances in 
      pure culture and spiked ground beef and human stools were evaluated and compared 
      with those of quantitative PCR (qPCR). No false-positive or false-negative
      results were observed among 90 bacterial strains used to evaluate assay
      specificity. The limits of detection for seven STEC strains of various serogroups
      (O26, O45, O103, O111, O121, O145, and O157) were approximately 1 to 20
      CFU/reaction in pure culture and 10(3) to 10(4) CFU/g in spiked ground beef,
      which were comparable to the results of qPCR. Standard curves generated suggested
      good linear relationships between STEC cell numbers and LAMP turbidity signals.
      When applied in ground beef samples spiked with two low levels (1 to 2 and 10 to 
      20 CFU/25 g) of STEC cultures, the LAMP assays achieved accurate detection after 
      6 to 8 h enrichment. The assays also consistently detected STEC in human stool
      specimens spiked with 10(3) or 10(4) CFU/0.5 g stool after 4 h enrichment, while 
      qPCR required 4 to 6 h. In conclusion, the LAMP assays developed in this study
      may facilitate rapid and reliable identification of STEC contaminations in
      high-risk food commodities and also facilitate prompt diagnosis of STEC
      infections in clinical laboratories.

PG  - 5-10
LID - 10.1016/j.tim.2011.09.004 [doi]
AB  - Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) mutants of lactobacilli suppress inflammation in animal
      models of experimental colitis. The fact that a single mutation of an
      administered Lactobacillus strain can result in enhanced probiotic efficacy is
      surprising given the genetic diversity and complexity of the intestinal niche,
      but at the same time exciting from a microbiological, immunological and
      gastroenterological point of view. In this Opinion article, we discuss the
      possible impacts of LTA modification in probiotic bacteria in the context of the 
      current knowledge regarding the proinflammatory capacity of LTA,
      structure-activity relationships of LTA, intestinal LTA recognition in healthy
      and colitis conditions and anti-inflammatory molecules of lactobacilli.

TI  - Lactococci and lactobacilli as mucosal delivery vectors for therapeutic proteins 
      and DNA vaccines.
PG  - S4
LID - 10.1186/1475-2859-10-S1-S4 [doi]
AB  - Food-grade Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) have been safely consumed for centuries by 
      humans in fermented foods. Thus, they are good candidates to develop novel oral
      vectors, constituting attractive alternatives to attenuated pathogens, for
      mucosal delivery strategies. Herein, this review summarizes our research, up
      until now, on the use of LAB as mucosal delivery vectors for therapeutic proteins
      and DNA vaccines. Most of our work has been based on the model LAB Lactococcus
      lactis, for which we have developed efficient genetic tools, including expression
      signals and host strains, for the heterologous expression of therapeutic proteins
      such as antigens, cytokines and enzymes. Resulting recombinant lactococci strains
      have been tested successfully for their prophylactic and therapeutic effects in
      different animal models: i) against human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16)-induced
      tumors in mice, ii) to partially prevent a bovine beta-lactoglobulin
      (BLG)-allergic reaction in mice and iii) to regulate body weight and food
      consumption in obese mice. Strikingly, all of these tools have been successfully 
      transposed to the Lactobacillus genus, in recent years, within our laboratory.
      Notably, anti-oxidative Lactobacillus casei strains were constructed and tested
      in two chemically-induced colitis models. In parallel, we also developed a
      strategy based on the use of L. lactis to deliver DNA at the mucosal level, and
      were able to show that L. lactis is able to modulate the host response through
      DNA delivery. Today, we consider that all of our consistent data, together with
      those obtained by other groups, demonstrate and reinforce the interest of using
      LAB, particularly lactococci and lactobacilli strains, to develop novel
      therapeutic protein mucosal delivery vectors which should be tested now in human 
      clinical trials.

TI  - Functional analysis of colonic bacterial metabolism: relevant to health?
PG  - G1-9
LID - 10.1152/ajpgi.00048.2011 [doi]
AB  - With the use of molecular techniques, numerous studies have evaluated the
      composition of the intestinal microbiota in health and disease. However, it is of
      major interest to supplement this with a functional analysis of the microbiota.
      In this review, the different approaches that have been used to characterize
      microbial metabolites, yielding information on the functional end products of
      microbial metabolism, have been summarized. To analyze colonic microbial
      metabolites, the most conventional way is by application of a hypothesis-driven
      targeted approach, through quantification of selected metabolites from
      carbohydrate (e.g., short-chain fatty acids) and protein fermentation (e.g.,
      p-cresol, phenol, ammonia, or H(2)S), secondary bile acids, or colonic enzymes.
      The application of stable isotope-labeled substrates can provide an elegant
      solution to study these metabolic pathways in vivo. On the other hand, a top-down
      approach can be followed by applying metabolite fingerprinting techniques based
      on (1)H-NMR or mass spectrometric analysis. Quantification of known metabolites
      and characterization of metabolite patterns in urine, breath, plasma, and fecal
      samples can reveal new pathways and give insight into physiological regulatory
      processes of the colonic microbiota. In addition, specific metabolic profiles can
      function as a diagnostic tool for the identification of several gastrointestinal 
      diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Nevertheless, future
      research will have to evaluate the relevance of associations between metabolites 
      and different disease states.

      in the absence of known causes for such tissue eosinophilia. These may be
      classified into eosinophilic esophagitis, eosinophilic gastroenteritis and
      eosinophilic colitis (EC). This review focuses on EC: its pathogenesis,
      epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis and current approach to treatment.
      SOURCES OF DATA: A literature review published in English was performed using
      Pubmed, Ovid, Google scholar search engines with the following keywords:
      eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorder, EC, eosinophils, colitis and
      gastrointestinal. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: The basis for primary EC appears related to
      increased sensitivity to allergens, principally as a food allergy in infants and 
      a T lymphocyte-mediated event in adults. Endoscopic changes are generally modest,
      featuring edema and patchy granularity. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: Clear clinical and 
      pathological diagnostic criteria of EC and its management strategy. GROWING
      POINTS: Intestinal involvement of EC is primarily mucosal, presenting as a mild
      self-limited proctitis in infants and self-limited colitis in young adults.
      Therapeutic approaches based on case reports tend to use either elimination diets
      to avoid a presumed allergen; agents traditionally used in inflammatory disease
      or targeted drugs like anti-histamines or leukotriene receptor antagonists. AREAS
      TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: Prospective randomized controlled trials
      addressing the disease natural history, possible preventive methods and effective
      medical approach and long-term prognosis are required.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) feature multiple cellular stress
      responses, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) unfolded protein responses
      (UPRs). UPRs represent autoregulatory pathways that adjust organelle capacity to 
      cellular demand. A similar mechanism, mitochondrial UPR (mtUPR), has been
      described for mitochondria. ER UPR in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs)
      contributes to the development of intestinal inflammation, and since
      mitochondrial alterations and dysfunction are implicated in the pathogenesis of
      IBDs, the authors characterised mtUPR in the context of intestinal inflammation. 
      METHODS: Truncated ornithine transcarbamylase was used to selectively induce
      mtUPR in a murine IEC line. Dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) was administered to PKR
      (double-stranded-RNA-activated protein kinase) knockout mice to induce IEC stress
      in vivo and to test for their susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis. Expression
      levels of the mitochondrial chaperone chaperonin 60 (CPN60) and PKR were
      quantified in IECs from patients with IBDs and from murine models of colitis
      using immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Selective mtUPR
      induction by truncated ornithine transcarbamylase transfection triggered the
      phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 2alpha and cJun
      through the recruitment of PKR. Using pharmacological inhibitors and small
      inhibitory RNA, the authors identified mtUPR-induced eIF2alpha phosphorylation
      and transcription factor activation (cJun/AP1) as being dependent on the
      activities of the mitochondrial protease ClpP and the cytoplasmic kinase PKR.
      Pkr(-/-) mice failed to induce CPN60 in IECs upon DSS treatment at early time
      points and subsequently showed an almost complete resistance to DSS-induced
      colitis. Under inflammatory conditions, primary IECs from patients with IBDs and 
      two murine models of colitis exhibited a strong induction of the mtUPR marker
      protein CPN60 associated with enhanced expression of PKR. CONCLUSION: PKR
      integrates mtUPR into the disease-relevant ER UPR via eIF2alpha phosphorylation
      and AP1 activation. Induction of mtUPR and PKR was observed in IECs from murine
      models and patients with IBDs. The authors' results indicate that PKR might link 
      mitochondrial stress to intestinal inflammation.

AB  - Many different kinds of fermented food are consumed daily in Taiwan, such as
      stinky tofu, suan-tsai, and fu-tsai. We have previously reported the diversity of
      lactic acid bacteria (LAB) at different stages of fermentation in the production 
      of suan-tsai and fu-tsai. In this study, the anti-inflammatory and
      immunomodulatory activities of Lactobacillus plantarum K68 (K68) isolated from
      fu-tsai were evaluated. K68 significantly inhibited the production of tumor
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) in
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cells and stimulated
      interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production in human peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells (hPBMCs). Additionally, orally administered K68 ameliorated dextran sulfate
      sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis (UC) in BALB/c mice. Both the disease
      activity index (DAI) and histological scores (HIS) showed that the severity of UC
      was significantly reduced by oral administration of K68. Furthermore, the
      production of pro inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta),
      and interleukin-6 (IL-6) was significantly reduced in K68-administered group.
      Colonic mRNA expression levels of TNF-alpha, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), forkhead
      box P3 (Foxp3), suppressors of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), and toll like
      receptor 4 (TLR4), were also reduced in the K68-administered group. These results
      suggest that K68 exhibits anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities that 
      ameliorate DSS-induced experimental colitis.

AB  - Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis after ileal pouch anal
      anastomosis in ulcerative colitis patients are often refractory to standard
      therapy. Over the last decade, the rational to use probiotics and its beneficial 
      efficacy in the treatment of chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is
      increasingly under scrutiny. Although it has become clear that intestinal
      epithelial-mucosal immune interactions and enteric bacteria play a critical role 
      in the development of IBD, the substantial clinical efficacy of probiotics in
      these disorders is less evident. This review outlines the clinical studies
      regarding probiotics before October 2007. These studies formed the foundation of 
      probiotic clinical trials in IBD, but they also indicated the need of larger and 
      better-controlled studies than the past experimental approaches. Furthermore,
      this review also examines in-depth the probiotic clinical trials published
      between 2007 and December 2010, providing new insights into the role of
      probiotics for inducing and maintaining remission of IBD, and highlighting some
      of the breakthroughs, especially regarding induction of remission for ulcerative 
      colitis.

TI  - The anxiolytic effect of Bifidobacterium longum NCC3001 involves vagal pathways
      for gut-brain communication.
PG  - 1132-9
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2982.2011.01796.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The probiotic Bifidobacterium longum NCC3001 normalizes anxiety-like 
      behavior and hippocampal brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in mice with
      infectious colitis. Using a model of chemical colitis we test whether the
      anxiolytic effect of B. longum involves vagal integrity, and changes in neural
      cell function. Methods Mice received dextran sodium sulfate (DSS, 3%) in drinking
      water during three 1-week cycles. Bifidobacterium longum or placebo were gavaged 
      daily during the last cycle. Some mice underwent subdiaphragmatic vagotomy.
      Behavior was assessed by step-down test, inflammation by myeloperoxidase (MPO)
      activity and histology. BDNF mRNA was measured in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells
      after incubation with sera from B. longum- or placebo-treated mice. The effect of
      B. longum on myenteric neuron excitability was measured using intracellular
      microelectrodes. KEY RESULTS: Chronic colitis was associated with anxiety-like
      behavior, which was absent in previously vagotomized mice. B. longum normalized
      behavior but had no effect on MPO activity or histological scores. Its anxiolytic
      effect was absent in mice with established anxiety that were vagotomized before
      the third DSS cycle. B. longum metabolites did not affect BDNF mRNA expression in
      SH-SY5Y cells but decreased excitability of enteric neurons. CONCLUSIONS &
      INFERENCES: In this colitis model, anxiety-like behavior is vagally mediated. The
      anxiolytic effect of B. longum requires vagal integrity but does not involve gut 
      immuno-modulation or production of BDNF by neuronal cells. As B. longum decreases
      excitability of enteric neurons, it may signal to the central nervous system by
      activating vagal pathways at the level of the enteric nervous system.

TI  - From gut microflora imbalance to mycobacteria infection: is there a relationship 
      with chronic intestinal inflammatory diseases?
PG  - 361-8
AB  - The gut of a healthy adult harbours a myriad of different microbial species. It
      is estimated that approximately 10 14 are present in total bacterial colony
      forming units (CFU). Each colony colonizes a specific intestinal tract. In
      healthy adult, the main control of intestinal bacterial colonization occurs
      through gastric acidity but also other factors can influence the intestinal
      microenvironment such as pH, temperature, competition among different bacterial
      strains, peristalsis, drugs, radiotherapy and much more. Impaired microbial
      homeostasis leads to an alteration of the permeability of tissue, together with
      the activation of the intestinal immune system MALT (mucosal associated lymphoid 
      tissue). In this regard we discuss the increasing experimental evidences of the
      role of commensal microbiota in the activation of specific intestinal
      immunocompetent cells. The aforementioned micro-environmental changes provide the
      substrate for the etiopathogenetic outbreak of numerous pathologies of
      gastro-intestinal tract, such as intestinal chronic inflammation (Crohn's disease
      and Ulcerative Colitis), together with a miscellany of extra intestinal
      disorders. This article is an overview of the latest scientific findings about
      the close causal relationship between intestinal microbial flora and inflammatory
      bowel diseases or other extra-intestinal diseases; it is also mentioned the
      possible relationship between mycobacteria and Chron's disease. Finally we
      analyse the beneficial role of probiotics.

TI  - Intestinal dendritic cells in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 3761-75

AB  - The gastrointestinal tract harbors a large number and diverse array of commensal 
      bacteria and is an important entry site for pathogens. For these reasons, the
      intestinal immune system is uniquely dedicated to protect against infections,
      while avoiding the development of destructive inflammatory responses to the
      microbiota. Several models have been proposed to explain how the immune system
      discriminates between, and appropriately responds to, commensal and pathogenic
      microorganisms. Dendritic cells (DCs) and regulatory T cells (Treg) are
      instrumental in maintaining immune homeostasis and tolerance in the gut. DCs are 
      virtually omnipresent and are remarkably plastic, having the ability to adapt to 
      the influences of the microenvironment. Different DC populations with partially
      overlapping phenotypic and functional properties have been described in different
      anatomical locations. DCs in the draining mesenteric lymph nodes, in the
      intestinal lamina propria and in Peyer's patches partake both in the control of
      intestinal inflammation and in the maintenance of gut tolerance. In this respect,
      gut-resident DCs and macrophages exert tolerogenic functions as they regularly
      encounter and sense commensal bacteria. In contrast, migrating DC subsets that
      are recruited to the gut as a result of pathogenic insults initiate immune
      responses. Importantly, tolerogenic DCs act by promoting the differentiation and 
      expansion of Treg cells that efficiently modulate gut inflammation, as shown both
      in pre-clinical models of colitis and in patients with inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD). This article reviews the phenotypic and functional features of gut DC
      subsets and discusses the current evidence underpinning the DC contribution to
      the pathogenesis of the major clinical subtypes of human IBD. It also addresses
      the potential clinical benefit derived from DC targeting either in vivo or in
      vitro.

TI  - Impaired butyrate oxidation in ulcerative colitis is due to decreased butyrate
      uptake and a defect in the oxidation pathway.
PG  - 1127-36
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21894 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In ulcerative colitis (UC) butyrate metabolism is impaired due to a
      defect in the butyrate oxidation pathway and/or transport. In the present study
      we correlated butyrate uptake and oxidation to the gene expression of the
      butyrate transporter SLC16A1 and the enzymes involved in butyrate oxidation
      (ACSM3, ACADS, ECHS1, HSD17B10, and ACAT2) in UC and controls. METHODS: Colonic
      mucosal biopsies were collected during endoscopy of 88 UC patients and 20
      controls with normal colonoscopy. Butyrate uptake and oxidation was measured by
      incubating biopsies with (14) C-labeled Na-butyrate. To assess gene expression,
      total RNA from biopsies was used for quantitative reverse-transcription
      polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In 20 UC patients, gene expression was
      reassessed after treatment with infliximab. RESULTS: Butyrate uptake and
      oxidation were significantly decreased in UC versus controls (P < 0.001 for
      both). Butyrate oxidation remained significantly reduced in UC after correction
      for butyrate uptake (P < 0.001), suggesting that the butyrate oxidation pathway
      itself is also affected. Also, the mucosal gene expression of SLC16A1, ACSM3,
      ACADS, ECHS1, HSD17B10, and ACAT2 was significantly decreased in UC as compared
      with controls (P < 0.001 for all). In a subgroup of patients (n = 20), the gene
      expression was reassessed after infliximab therapy. In responders to therapy, a
      significant increase in gene expression was observed. Nevertheless, only ACSM3
      mRNA levels returned to control values after therapy in the responders groups.
      CONCLUSIONS: The deficiency in the colonic butyrate metabolism in UC is initiated
      at the gene expression level and is the result of a decreased expression of
      SLC16A1 and enzymes in the beta-oxidation pathway of butyrate.

TI  - Heat-killed body of lactobacillus brevis SBC8803 ameliorates intestinal injury in
      a murine model of colitis by enhancing the intestinal barrier function.
PG  - 2235-50
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21597 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics have been clinically administered to improve intestinal
      damage in some intestinal inflammations. However, probiotic treatments are not
      always effective for these intestinal disorders because live bacteria must
      colonize and maintain their activity under unfavorable conditions in the
      intestinal lumen when displaying their functions. This study investigated the
      physiological functions of a heat-killed body of a novel probiotic, Lactobacillus
      brevis SBC8803, on the protection of intestinal tissues, the regulation of
      cytokine production, the improvement of intestinal injury, and the survival rate 
      of mice with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. METHODS: Heat shock
      protein (Hsp) induction and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
      phosphorylation in intestinal epithelia by heat-killed L. brevis SBC8803 were
      examined by Western blotting. The barrier function of intestinal epithelia was
      measured with [(3) H]-mannitol flux in the small intestine under oxidant stress. 
      The effects of the bacteria on improving epithelial injury and cumulative
      survival rate were investigated with a DSS colitis model. RESULTS: Heat-killed L.
      brevis SBC8803 induced Hsps, phosphorylated p38 MAPK, regulated the expression of
      tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-12, and
      improved the barrier function of intestinal epithelia under oxidant stress. The
      induction of Hsp and the protective effect were negated by p38 MAPK inhibitor.
      These functions relieve intestinal impairments and improve the survival rate in
      mice with lethal colitis. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of heat-killed L.
      brevis SBC8803 helps to successfully maintain intestinal homeostasis, while also 
      curing intestinal inflammation. A therapeutic strategy using heat-killed bacteria
      is expected to be beneficial for human health even in conditions unsuitable for
      live probiotics because the heat-killed body is able to exhibit its effects
      without the requirement of colonization.

TI  - In vitro fermentation of sugar beet arabino-oligosaccharides by fecal microbiota 
      obtained from patients with ulcerative colitis to selectively stimulate the
      growth of Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp.
PG  - 8336-44
LID - 10.1128/AEM.05895-11 [doi]
AB  - The potential prebiotic properties of arabino-oligosaccharides (AOS) derived from
      sugar beet pulp was studied using mixed cultures of human fecal bacteria from
      patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), in remission or with active disease, and
      in healthy controls. These results were compared to those for
      fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), which are known to have a prebiotic effect.
      Fermentation studies were carried out using a small-scale static batch system,
      and changes in the fecal microbial communities and metabolites were monitored
      after 24 h by quantitative real-time PCR and short-chain fatty acid analysis.
      With a few minor exceptions, AOS affected the communities similarly to what was
      seen for FOS. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that Bifidobacterium spp. and
      Lactobacillus spp. were selectively increased after fermentation of AOS or FOS by
      fecal microbiota derived from UC patients. The stimulation of growth of
      Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. was accompanied by a high production 
      of acetate and hence a decrease of pH. The fermentation of AOS may help improve
      the inflammatory conditions in UC patients through stimulation of bacteria
      eliciting anti-inflammatory responses and through production of acetate. AOS may 
      therefore represent a new prebiotic candidate for reduction of the risk of
      flare-ups in UC patients. However, human trials are needed to confirm a
      health-promoting effect.

TI  - The water-soluble extract from cultured medium of Ganoderma lucidum (Reishi)
      mycelia (Designated as MAK) ameliorates murine colitis induced by trinitrobenzene
      sulphonic acid.
PG  - 454-62
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-3083.2011.02601.x [doi]
AB  - Ganoderma lucidum Karst is well known as 'Reishi', a traditional food in China
      and Japan. It contains a polysaccharide component known to induce granulocyte
      macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) production from murine splenocytes.
      Moreover, GM-CSF may be a therapeutic agent for Crohn's disease. In this study,
      we investigated the water-soluble, polysaccharide components of Reishi
      (designated as MAK) in murine colitis induced by trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid
      (TNBS). We examined the concentration of GM-CSF in peritoneal macrophage cells
      (PMs) of C57BL/6 mice during in vitro and in vivo stimulation with MAK. After
      feeding with chow or MAK for 2 weeks, 2 mg of TNBS/50% ethanol was administered
      to each mouse. After 3 days of TNBS treatment, intestinal inflammation was
      evaluated, and mononuclear cells of the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) and colon
      were cultured for ELISA. To determine the preventive role of GM-CSF, the mice
      were pre-treated with or without anti-GM-CSF antibody before TNBS administration.
      In vitro and in vivo MAK-stimulated PMs produced GM-CSF in a dose-dependent
      manner. Intestinal inflammation by TNBS was improved by feeding with MAK. MLNs of
      mice treated with TNBS produced IFN-gamma, which was inhibited by feeding with
      MAK. In contrast, MLNs of mice treated with TNBS inhibited GM-CSF production,
      which was induced by feeding with MAK. The colon organ culture assay also
      revealed that IFN-gamma was decreased and GM-CSF was increased by MAK. The
      preventive effect was blocked by the neutralization of GM-CSF. We concluded that 
      the induction of GM-CSF by MAK may provide the anti-inflammatory effect.

TI  - Nutritional problems in inflammatory bowel disease: the patient perspective.
PG  - 443-50
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2011.04.016 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Crohn's Disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which may result in nutrition problems that
      impact on patient health, nutritional status and quality of life. Subjective
      reports of how IBD patients experience these problems as part of their disease
      process, including comparisons between patient groups, or the need for tailored
      nutrition advice as perceived by these patients, have not been widely studied.
      This survey aimed to identify and explore nutritional problems that are important
      to CD and UC patients and to investigate their views on the IBD health services
      provided to help them with these. METHODS: Eighty-seven IBD patients were invited
      to take part in a nutrition survey using face-to-face questionnaire interviews.
      The survey asked about food and nutrition problems that patients have
      experienced, identifying which were most significant and the extent to which they
      had been addressed by the clinical service. RESULTS: Seventy-two IBD patients
      completed the evaluation (47 CD, 25 UC). Of these, 45 (62.5%) felt that food and 
      nutrition were either 'important' or 'extremely important' in their experience of
      IBD, and 59 (82%) reported problems with food and nutrition. Patients with CD and
      UC reported similar frequencies of most nutritional problems. However, 44 (94%)
      CD vs. 16 (64%) UC patients reported problems with weight (p=0.002). Less than
      half of patients had seen a dietitian for tailored nutritional advice to address 
      these problems. CONCLUSIONS: Nutritional problems experienced and reported by IBD
      patients are numerous and varied. They are considered important by patients with 
      CD and UC, both of whom would generally value specific dietary counselling,
      highlighting a need for further research in this area and adequate and equal
      provision of services for both groups.

TI  - Polyphenol supplementation as a complementary medicinal approach to treating
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 4851-65
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) comprises a group of idiopathic chronic
      intestinal inflammation syndromes that are very common in developed countries. It
      is characterized by intermittent episodes of clinical remission and relapse, with
      recurrent inflammatory injury that can lead to structural damage of the
      intestine. The uncontrolled intestinal immune response to bacterial antigens
      leads to the production of abundant cytokines and chemokines, by activated
      leukocytes and epithelial cells, which trigger inflammatory and oxidative
      reactions. The current treatment of IBD consists in long-term anti-inflammatory
      therapy that, however, does not exclude relapses and side effects, frequently
      resulting in surgical intervention. Polyphenols have been acknowledged to be
      anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory and therefore, have been proposed as an
      alternative natural approach to prevent or treat chronic inflammatory diseases.
      Most studies have been in animal models of colitis, using chemical inducers or
      mice defective in anti-inflammatory mediators and in intestinal cell lines
      treated with pro-inflammatory cytokines or lipid oxidation products. These
      studies provide evidence that polyphenols can effectively modulate intestinal
      inflammation. They exert their effects by modulating cell signaling pathways,
      mainly activated in response to oxidative and inflammatory stimuli, and NF-kB is 
      the principal downstream effector. Polyphenols may thus be considered able to
      prevent or delay the progression of IBD, especially because they reach higher
      concentrations in the gut than in other tissues. However, knowledge of the use of
      polyphenols in managing human IBD is still scanty, and further clinical studies
      should afford more solid evidence of their beneficial effects.

TI  - DNFB-DNS hapten-induced colitis in mice should not be considered a model of
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 2087-101
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21586 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The dinitrofluorobenzene/dinitrosulfonic acid (DNFB/DNS) model was
      originally described as an experimental model of intestinal inflammation
      resembling human ulcerative colitis (UC). Due to the absence of acceptable UC
      experimental models for pharmacological preclinical assays, here we examine the
      immune response induced in this model. METHODS: Balb/c mice were sensitized by
      skin application of DNFB on day 1, followed by an intrarectal challenge with DNS 
      on day 5. We further expanded this model by administering a second DNS challenge 
      on day 15. The features of colonic inflammation and immune response were
      evaluated. RESULTS: The changes observed in colonic tissue corresponded, in
      comparison to the trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) colitis model, to a mild
      mucosal effect in the colon, which spontaneously resolved in less than 5 days.
      Furthermore, the second hapten challenge did not exacerbate the inflammatory
      response. In contrast to other studies, we did not observe any clear involvement 
      of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) or other Th1 cytokines during the
      initial inflammatory response; however, we found that a more Th2-humoral response
      appeared to mediate the first contact with the hapten. An increased humoral
      response was detected during the second challenge, although an increased
      Th1/Th17-cytokine expression profile was also simultaneously observed.
      CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of these results, although the DNFB/DNS model can
      display some features found in human UC, it should be considered as a model for
      the study of the intestinal hypersensitivity seen, for example, during food
      allergy or irritable bowel syndrome but not intestinal inflammation per se.

      dendritic cells from patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.
PG  - G1083-92
LID - 10.1152/ajpgi.00217.2011 [doi]
AB  - Saccharomyces boulardii (Sb) is a probiotic yeast that has demonstrated efficacy 
      in pilot studies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Microbial
      antigen handling by dendritic cells (DC) is believed to be of critical importance
      for immunity and tolerance in IBD. The aim was to characterize the effects of Sb 
      on DC from IBD patients. Highly purified (>95%), lipopolysaccharide-stimulated
      CD1c(+)CD11c(+)CD123(-) myeloid DC (mDC) from patients with ulcerative colitis
      (UC; n = 36), Crohn's disease (CD; n = 26), or infectious controls (IC; n = 4)
      were cultured in the presence or absence of fungal supernatant from Sb (SbS).
      Phenotype and cytokine production and/or secretion of IBD mDC were measured by
      flow cytometry and cytometric bead arrays, respectively. T cell phenotype and
      proliferation were assessed in a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) with allogenic
      CD4(+)CD45RA(+) naive T cells from healthy donors. Mucosal healing was
      investigated in epithelial wounding and migration assays with IEC-6 cells. SbS
      significantly decreased the frequency of CD40-, CD80-, and CD197 (CCR7; chemokine
      receptor-7)-expressing IBD mDC and reduced their secretion of tumor necrosis
      factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 while increasing IL-8. In the MLR, SbS 
      significantly inhibited T cell proliferation induced by IBD mDC. Moreover, SbS
      inhibited T(H)1 (TNF-alpha and interferon-gamma) polarization induced by UC mDC
      and promoted IL-8 and transforming growth factor-beta-dependent mucosal healing. 
      In summary, we provide novel evidence of synergistic mechanisms how Sb controls
      inflammation (inhibition of T cell costimulation and inflammation-associated
      migration and mobilization of DC) and promotes epithelial restitution relevant in
      IBD.

TI  - Mycobacterium paratuberculosis and autism: is this a trigger?
PG  - 977-81
LID - 10.1016/j.mehy.2011.08.024 [doi]
AB  - Autism is a heterogeneous group of life-long neurologic problems that begin in
      childhood. Success in efforts to understand and treat autism has been mostly
      elusive. The role of autoimmunity in autism has gained recognition both for
      associated systemic autoimmune disease and the presence of brain autoantibodies
      in autistic children and their family members. There is an acknowledged genetic
      susceptibility to autism--most notably allotypes of complement C4. C4 defects are
      associated with several autoimmune diseases and also confer susceptibility to
      mycobacterial infections. Mycobacterium avium ss. paratuberculosis (MAP) causes
      an enteric inflammatory disease in ruminant animals (Johne's disease) and is the 
      putative cause of the very similar Crohn's disease in humans. Humans are widely
      exposed to MAP in food and water. MAP has been also linked to ulcerative colitis,
      irritable bowel syndrome, sarcoidosis, Blau syndrome, autoimmune (Type 1)
      diabetes, Hashimoto's thyroiditis and multiple sclerosis. Environmental agents
      are thought to trigger autism in the genetically at risk. Molecular mimicry is
      the proposed mechanism by which MAP is thought to trigger autoantibodies.
      Autoantibodies to brain myelin basic protein (MBP) is a common feature of autism.
      This article considers the subset of autoimmunity-related autism patients and
      postulates that MAP, through molecular mimicry to its heat shock protein HSP65,
      triggers autism by stimulating antibodies that cross react with myelin basic
      protein (MBP).

TI  - Interactions with M cells and macrophages as key steps in the pathogenesis of
      enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli infections.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0023594 [doi]
AB  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) are food-borne pathogens that can cause
      serious infections ranging from diarrhea to hemorrhagic colitis (HC) and
      hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). Translocation of Shiga-toxins (Stx) from the gut
      lumen to underlying tissues is a decisive step in the development of the
      infection, but the mechanisms involved remain unclear. Many bacterial pathogens
      target the follicle-associated epithelium, which overlies Peyer's patches (PPs), 
      cross the intestinal barrier through M cells and are captured by mucosal
      macrophages. Here, translocation across M cells, as well as survival and
      proliferation of EHEC strains within THP-1 macrophages were investigated using
      EHEC O157:H7 reference strains, isogenic mutants, and 15 EHEC strains isolated
      from HC/HUS patients. We showed for the first time that E. coli O157:H7 strains
      are able to interact in vivo with murine PPs, to translocate ex vivo through
      murine ileal mucosa with PPs and across an in vitro human M cell model. EHEC
      strains are also able to survive and to produce Stx in macrophages, which induce 
      cell apoptosis and Stx release. In conclusion, our results suggest that the
      uptake of EHEC by M cells and underlying macrophages in the PP may be a critical 
      step in Stx translocation and release in vivo. A new model for EHEC infection in 
      humans is proposed that could help in a fuller understanding of EHEC-associated
      diseases.

AB  - Probiotics exhibit beneficial effects on human health, particularly in the
      maintenance of intestinal homeostasis in a complex manner notwithstanding the
      diversity of an intestinal flora between individuals. Thus, it is highly probable
      that some common molecules secreted by probiotic and/or commensal bacteria
      contribute to the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis and protect the
      intestinal epithelium from injurious stimuli. To address this question, we aimed 
      to isolate the cytoprotective compound from a lactobacillus strain, Lactobacillus
      brevis SBC8803 which possess the ability to induce cytoprotective heat shock
      proteins in mouse small intestine. L. brevis was incubated in MRS broth and the
      supernatant was passed through with a 0.2-microm filter. Caco2/bbe cells were
      treated with the culture supernatant, and HSP27 expression was evaluated by
      Western blotting. HSP27-inducible components were separated by ammonium sulfate
      precipitation, DEAE anion exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and HPLC.
      Finally, we identified that the HSP27-inducible fraction was polyphosphate (poly 
      P), a simple repeated structure of phosphates, which is a common product of
      lactobacilli and other bacteria associated with intestinal microflora without any
      definitive physiological functions. Then, poly P was synthesized by poly
      P-synthesizing enzyme polyphosphate kinase. The synthesized poly P significantly 
      induced HSP27 from Caco2/BBE cells. In addition, Poly P suppressed the
      oxidant-induced intestinal permeability in the mouse small intestine and
      pharmacological inhibitors of p38 MAPK and integrins counteract its protective
      effect. Daily intrarectal administration of poly P (10 microg) improved the
      inflammation grade and survival rate in 4% sodium dextran sulfate-administered
      mice. This study, for the first time, demonstrated that poly P is the molecule
      responsible for maintaining intestinal barrier actions which are mediated through
      the intestinal integrin beta1-p38 MAPK.

PG  - e22978
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0022978 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adipocytes from mesenteric white adipose tissue amplify the
      inflammatory response and participate in inflammation-driven immune dysfunction
      in Crohn's disease by releasing proinflammatory mediators. Peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR)-alpha and -gamma, pregnane x receptor
      (PXR), farnesoid x receptor (FXR) and liver x-receptor (LXR) are ligand-activated
      nuclear receptor that provide counter-regulatory signals to dysregulated immunity
      and modulates adipose tissue. AIMS: To investigate the expression and function of
      nuclear receptors in intestinal and adipose tissues in a rodent model of colitis 
      and mesenteric fat from Crohn's patients and to investigate their modulation by
      probiotics. METHODS: Colitis was induced by TNBS administration. Mice were
      administered vehicle or VSL#3, daily for 10 days. Abdominal fat explants obtained
      at surgery from five Crohn's disease patients and five patients with colon cancer
      were cultured with VSL#3 medium. RESULTS: Probiotic administration attenuated
      development of signs and symptoms of colitis, reduced colonic expression of
      TNFalpha, IL-6 and IFNgamma and reserved colonic downregulation of PPARgamma, PXR
      and FXR caused by TNBS. Mesenteric fat depots isolated from TNBS-treated animals 
      had increased expression of inflammatory mediators along with PPARgamma, FXR,
      leptin and adiponectin. These changes were prevented by VSL#3. Creeping fat and
      mesenteric adipose tissue from Crohn's patients showed a differential expression 
      of PPARgamma and FXR with both tissue expressing high levels of leptin. Exposure 
      of these tissues to VSL#3 medium abrogates leptin release. CONCLUSIONS:
      Mesenteric adipose tissue from rodent colitis and Crohn's disease is
      metabolically active and shows inflammation-driven regulation of PPARgamma, FXR
      and leptin. Probiotics correct the inflammation-driven metabolic dysfunction.

AB  - Studies showed that specific probiotics provide therapeutic benefits in
      inflammatory bowel disease. In vitro evidence suggested that Lactobacillus
      paracasei also called ST11 (CNCM I-2116) is a potent strain with immune
      modulation properties. However, little is known about its capacity to alleviate
      inflammatory symptoms in vivo In this context, the main objective of this study
      was to investigate the role of ST11 on intestinal inflammation using the adoptive
      transfer mouse model of experimental colitis. Rag2(-/-) recipient mice were fed
      with ST11 (10(9) CFU/day)a month prior toinduce colitis by adoptive transfer of
      naive T cells. One month later, in clear contrast to nonfed mice, weight loss was
      significantly reduced by 50% in ST11-fed mice. Further analysis of colon
      specimens revealed a significant reduction neutrophil infiltration and mucosal
      expression of IL1beta, IL-6, and IL12 proinflammatory cytokines, whereas no
      consistent differences in expression of antibacterial peptides or tight junction 
      proteins were observed between PBS and ST11-fed mice. All together, our results
      demonstrate that oral administration of ST11 was safe and had a significant
      preventive effect on colitis. We conclude that probiotics such as Lactobacillus
      paracasei harbor worthwhile in vivo immunomodulatory properties to prevent
      intestinal inflammation by nutritional approaches.

AB  - Complex and highly variable site-dependent bacterial ecosystems exist throughout 
      the length of the human gastrointestinal tract. Until relatively recently, the
      majority of our information on intestinal microbiotas has come from studies on
      feces, or from aspirates taken from the upper gut. However, there is evidence
      showing that mucosal bacteria growing in biofilms on surfaces lining the gut
      differ from luminal populations, and that due to their proximity to the
      epithelial surface, these organisms may be important in modulating the host's
      immune system and contributing to some chronic inflammatory diseases. Over the
      past decade, increasing interest in mucosal bacteria, coupled with advances in
      molecular approaches for assessing microbial diversity, has begun to provide some
      insight into the complexity of these mucosa-associated communities. In
      gastrointestinal conditions such as inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative
      colitis, Crohn's disease), it has been shown that a dysbiosis exists in microbial
      community structure, and that there is a reduction in putatively protective
      mucosal organisms such as bifidobacteria. Therefore, manipulation of mucosal
      communities may be beneficial in restoring normal functionality in the gut,
      thereby improving the immune status and general health of the host. Biofilm
      structure and function has been studied intensively in the oral cavity, and as a 
      consequence, mucosal communities in the mouth will not be covered in this
      chapter. This review addresses our current knowledge of mucosal populations in
      the gastrointestinal tract, changes that can occur in community structure in
      disease, and therapeutic modulation of biofilm composition by antibiotics,
      prebiotics, and probiotics.

AB  - In inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), it is known that besides genetic and
      environmental factors (e.g. diet, drugs, stress), the microbiota play an
      important role in the pathogenesis. Patients with IBD have an altered microbiota 
      (dysbiosis) and therefore, probiotics, defined as 'live micro-organisms that when
      administered in adequate amounts can confer a health benefit on the host', have
      been suggested as nutritional supplements to restore these imbalances. The best
      response on probiotics among the different types of IBD appears to be in the case
      of ulcerative colitis. Although probiotics show promise in IBD in both clinical
      and animal studies, further mechanistic studies are necessary to optimize the use
      of probiotics as supporting therapy in IBD. Murine models of experimental colitis
      have been used for decades to study this pathology, and these models have been
      proven useful to search for new therapeutic approaches. The purpose of this
      review is to summarize probiotic-host interaction studies in murine models of
      experimental colitis and to evaluate how these models can further help in
      understanding these complex interactions. Unraveling the molecular mechanisms
      behind the beneficial effects will assist in better and possibly more efficient
      probiotic formulations.

TI  - Serum concentrations of VEGF and TGF-beta1 during exclusive enteral nutrition in 
      IBD.
PG  - 150-5
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3182144c74 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is an effective method of
      treatment in achieving remission in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however,
      its mechanism of action is still poorly understood. The objective of our study
      was to assess the influence of EEN on serum vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1) in children and
      adolescents with IBD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine children and adolescents 
      with IBD (24 with Crohn disease [CD] and 15 with ulcerative colitis [UC]) and 25 
      healthy controls were enrolled in the study. VEGF and TGF-beta1 were assessed at 
      the baseline and after 2 and 4 weeks of EEN in CD and UC groups and once in
      controls using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay immunoassays. RESULTS: At the
      baseline, we found increased serum VEGF in the CD versus UC group and controls (P
      < 0.05) and serum TGF-beta1 in the UC versus CD group and controls (P < 0.05).
      During EEN, VEGF decreased in the UC and CD groups, whereas TGF-beta1 increased
      in the CD group and decreased in the UC group. The CD group achieved disease
      remission faster than the UC group, and the weight gain of patients with CD
      during EEN was higher compared with patients with UC. Additionally, TGF-beta1
      concentration correlated with protein and energies daily intake in the CD group
      (R = 0.95; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Different effectiveness of EEN in achieving
      remission in CD and UC may result from a modification of growth factor
      production. EEN stimulated TGF-beta1 production in CD but not in UC, which
      possibly resulted in higher effectiveness of EEN in this group of patients.

TI  - Pharmacotherapy for acute pouchitis.
PG  - 1127-37
LID - 10.1345/aph.1P790 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the current literature concerning the medical treatment of
      acute and chronic pouchitis. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE and International
      Pharmaceutical Abstracts were searched (both 1965-February 2011) using the
      following terms: pouchitis, Crohn's, ulcerative colitis, diagnosis, prophylaxis, 
      and treatment. Bibliographies from key articles were also searched, and all
      pertinent articles were reviewed. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All
      available primary literature published in English on treatment for pouchitis was 
      considered, with controlled trials receiving highest priority. DATA SYNTHESIS:
      Pouchitis occurs in up to 50% of ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) patients
      with inflammatory bowel disease within 10 years of the procedure. Symptoms
      include abdominal pain, bloating, and fecal incontinence with frequent diarrhea. 
      The diagnosis of pouchitis is usually made based on symptoms as well as
      endoscopic and histologic findings. Treatment of acute pouchitis includes
      antimicrobials such as ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and rifaximin. If these
      fail, limited data suggest that oral budesonide, mesalamine, or infliximab may be
      effective treatments. Surgical revision may be necessary if medical treatments
      fail. Emerging evidence suggests that the probiotic compound VSL#3 may be
      effective in preventing the recurrence of pouchitis. CONCLUSIONS: Pouchitis is a 
      common complication of IPAA surgery. The strongest data suggest that
      antimicrobial therapy is an effective first-line treatment for acute pouchitis,
      and VSL#3 may be effective for prevention of recurrence.

TI  - Best strategies in recurrent or persistent Clostridium difficile infection.
PG  - 235-9
LID - 10.1089/sur.2010.080 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the primary cause of
      antibiotic-associated colitis and 15-25% of nosocomial antibiotic-associated
      diarrhea. Its clinical manifestations can range from mild diarrhea to toxic
      megacolon, bowel perforation, septic shock, and death. Over the past decade, more
      virulent strains have become increasingly common causes, and the incidence of CDI
      has risen, especially in elderly patients. These developments have led to an
      increase in recurrent CDI, which is more difficult to treat. This review focuses 
      on recurrent CDI and its treatment. METHODS: MEDLINE review using search terms
      Clostridium difficile, Clostridium difficile infection, recurrent Clostridium
      difficile infection. RESULTS: A first recurrence may be treated with the same
      regimen as the first episode. Metronidazole 500 mg q 8 h for 10-14 days is the
      drug of choice for moderate infection, and vancomycin 125 mg q 6 h for 10-14 days
      is the drug of choice for severe CDI. Metronidazole should not be used for
      treatment of subsequent recurrences because of potential neurotoxicity and
      hepatic toxicity. Second recurrences should be treated with an oral vancomycin
      course and taper: 125 mg q 6 h x 10-14 days, 125 mg q 12 h x 7 days, 125 mg q 24 
      h x 7 days, 125 mg q 48-72 h x 2-8 weeks. Alternative agents are fecal
      bacteriotherapy, a "rifaximin chaser," nitazoxanide, probiotics, and intravenous 
      immunoglobulin. Fidaxomicin has been approved recently. Monoclonal antibodies
      against C. difficile toxin remain investigational. CONCLUSION: Treatment of
      recurrent CDI remains challenging. Because of the lack of high-quality studies,
      recommendations for treatment are based on expert opinion. Metronidazole and
      vancomycin are the mainstays of treatment for both the initial infection and the 
      first recurrence. For second recurrences, a vancomycin course plus taper is
      recommended. For subsequent recurrences, treatment options are many, with no one 
      approach being entirely satisfactory. New drugs (fidaximicin) and treatments
      (monoclonal antibodies against the causative toxin) appear promising.

TI  - Allergic proctocolitis refractory to maternal hypoallergenic diet in exclusively 
      breast-fed infants: a clinical observation.
PG  - 82
LID - 10.1186/1471-230X-11-82 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Allergic proctocolitis (APC) in exclusively breast-fed infants is
      caused by food proteins, deriving from maternal diet, transferred through
      lactation. In most cases a maternal cow milk-free diet leads to a prompt
      resolution of rectal bleeding, while in some patients a multiple food allergy can
      occur. The aim of this study was to assess whether the atopy patch test (APT)
      could be helpful to identify this subgroup of patients requiring to discontinue
      breast-feeding due to polisensitization. Additionally, we assessed the efficacy
      of an amino acid-based formula (AAF) when multiple food allergy is suspected.
      amino acid-based formula METHODS: We have prospectively enrolled 14 exclusively
      breast-fed infants with APC refractory to maternal allergen avoidance. The
      diagnosis was confirmed by endoscopy with biopsies. Skin prick tests and serum
      specific IgE for common foods, together with APTs for common foods plus breast
      milk, were performed. After a 1 month therapy of an AAF all patients underwent a 
      follow-up rectosigmoidoscopy. RESULTS: Prick tests and serum specific IgE were
      negative. APTs were positive in 100% infants, with a multiple positivity in 50%. 
      Sensitization was found for breast milk in 100%, cow's milk (50%), soy (28%), egg
      (21%), rice (14%), wheat (7%). Follow-up rectosigmoidoscopy confirmed the
      remission of APC in all infants. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that APT might
      become a useful tool to identify subgroups of infants with multiple
      gastrointestinal food allergy involving a delayed immunogenic mechanism, with the
      aim to avoid unnecessary maternal dietary restrictions before discontinuing
      breast-feeding.

TI  - Metabolomics of fecal extracts detects altered metabolic activity of gut
      microbiota in ulcerative colitis and irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 4208-18
LID - 10.1021/pr2003598 [doi]
AB  - (1)H NMR spectroscopy of aqueous fecal extracts has been used to investigate
      differences in metabolic activity of gut microbiota in patients with ulcerative
      colitis (UC) (n = 13), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (n = 10), and healthy
      controls (C) (n = 22). Up to four samples per individual were collected over 2
      years giving a total of 124 samples. Multivariate discriminant analysis, based on
      NMR data from all three groups, was able to predict UC and C group membership
      with good sensitivity and specificity; classification of IBS samples was less
      successful and could not be used for diagnosis. Trends were detected toward
      increased taurine and cadaverine levels in UC with increased bile acid and
      decreased branched chain fatty acids in IBS relative to controls; changes in
      short chain fatty acids and amino acids were not significant. Previous
      PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analysis of the same fecal
      material had shown alterations of the gut microbiota when comparing UC and IBS
      groups with controls. Hierarchical cluster analysis showed that DGGE profiles
      from the same individual were stable over time, but NMR spectra were more
      variable; canonical correlation analysis of NMR and DGGE data partly separated
      the three groups and revealed a correlation between the gut microbiota profile
      and metabolite composition.

AB  - The human gastrointestinal tract harbors a complex and abundant microbial
      community reaching as high as 10(13)-10(14) microorganisms in the colon. This
      endogenous microbiota forms a symbiotic relationship with their eukaryotic host
      and this close partnership helps maintain homeostasis by performing essential and
      non-redundant tasks (e.g. nutrition/energy and, immune system balance, pathogen
      exclusion). Although this relationship is essential and beneficial to the host,
      various events (e.g. infection, diet, stress, inflammation) may impact microbial 
      composition, leading to the formation of a dysbiotic microbiota, further
      impacting on health and disease states. For example, Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis, collectively termed inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), have
      been associated with the establishment of a dysbiotic microbiota. In addition,
      extra-intestinal disorders such as obesity and metabolic syndrome are also
      associated with the development of a dysbiotic microbiota. Consequently, there is
      an increasing interest in harnessing the power of the microbiome and modulating
      its composition as a means to alleviate intestinal pathologies/disorders and
      maintain health status. In this review, we will discuss the emerging relationship
      between the microbiota and development of colorectal cancer as well as present
      evidence that microbial manipulation (probiotic, prebiotic) impacts disease
      development.

AB  - During the last few years a significant advance has been achieved in the
      understanding of the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). From twin 
      studies it was evident that there is more that 50% concordance of Crohn's disease
      (CD) in monozygotic twin pairs, however it is only 3.6% among dizygotic twins.
      These data indicate that the genetic background may be responsible for 50% of the
      risk or 'susceptibility' to develop CD. Obviously it is not a sufficient
      condition as otherwise there would be 100% concordance of disease in monozygotic 
      twin pairs. Environmental factors as well must play an important role. This is
      further supported by the fact that there is only low development in genetic risk 
      factors over ten thousands of years. In contrast, the incidence of CD and
      ulcerative colitis (UC) has dramatically increased in Western countries in the
      last 100 years. This further supports the concept of a 'Western lifestyle
      factor(s)' that triggers chronic intestinal inflammation in a genetically
      susceptible host. The proof of the concept of a genetic susceptibility was
      achieved in 2001 with the discovery that NOD2 is the most important
      susceptibility gene for CD. The function of NOD2 has been investigated in detail.
      NOD2 is an intracellular 'alarm button', a receptor recognizing invading bacteria
      that entered the mucosal wall. NOD2 mutants associated with susceptibility to CD 
      seem to be deficient in their recognition of bacterial wall products. In a
      genome-wide association study a disease association was found in the
      autophagy-related 16-like 1 gene (ATG16L1). The ATG16L1 gene encodes a protein in
      the autophagosome pathway that processes intracellular bacteria. Based on these
      findings, CD is now discussed as an impaired and inadequate immune reaction to
      the gut bacteria which are a part of our environment (or perhaps 'in-vironment').
      In addition to NOD2 and ATG16L1, there are more 'innate' pathways by which
      commensal and pathogenic bacteria can directly interact with cells of the
      intestinal mucosa. The 'environment concept' and the 'genetic concept' of IBD
      pathophysiology are converging. With the finding that most susceptibility genes
      for CD and UC are involved in innate immune mechanisms and the primary defense
      against bacteria entering the mucosa, for the first time a unifying concept of
      the 'genetic pathophysiology hypothesis' and the 'environment pathophysiology
      hypothesis' of IBD was possible. Bacteria are the link between the environment
      and mucosal defense system.

TI  - Inhibition of the cytotoxic effect of Clostridium difficile in vitro by
      Clostridium butyricum MIYAIRI 588 strain.
PG  - 1617-25
LID - 10.1099/jmm.0.033423-0 [doi]
AB  - In contrast to most modern pharmaceuticals, probiotics are used in many parts of 
      the world with little or no research data on the complex system of interactions
      that each strain may elicit in the human body. Research on probiotics has
      recently become more significant, as probiotics have begun to be prescribed by
      clinicians as an alternative for some gut infections, especially when antibiotics
      are contraindicated. This study attempted to elucidate the inhibitory interaction
      between the Japanese probiotic strain Clostridium butyricum MIYAIRI 588 (CBM588) 
      and the hospital pathogen Clostridium difficile, which is responsible for a large
      proportion of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and colitis. CBM588 has previously 
      shown effectiveness against C. difficile in vivo, and here it was found that the 
      toxicity of C. difficile in in vitro co-culture with CBM588 was greatly decreased
      or absent. This was dependent on the inoculation ratio and was not accounted for 
      by the small degree of growth and mRNA inhibition observed. CBM588 and its
      cell-free supernatant also had no effect on toxin already secreted into the
      culture medium, and culture of the two strains separated by a semi-permeable
      membrane resulted in loss of the inhibition. Therefore, it was concluded that the
      detoxification probably occurred by the inhibition of toxin protein production
      and that this required close proximity or contact between the two species. The
      low-pH conditions caused by organic acid secretion were also observed to have
      inhibitory effects on C. difficile growth, metabolism and toxicity.

TI  - Bovine lactoferrin induces interleukin-11 production in a hepatitis mouse model
      and human intestinal myofibroblasts.
PG  - 343-51
LID - 10.1007/s00394-011-0219-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Orally administered bovine lactoferrin (bLF) exerts an anti-inflammatory
      effect on hepatitis and colitis animal models. To investigate the mechanism
      underlying the action of bLF, we explored the expression of inflammation-related 
      factors in the intestine of a hepatitis mouse model after the oral administration
      of bLF and in several human intestinal cell lines treated with bLF. METHODS: The 
      effects of bLF on the expression of interleukin-11 (IL-11) and bone morphogenetic
      protein 2 (BMP2) in the intestinal mucosa of a hepatitis mouse model as well as
      in cell cultures of human intestinal epithelial cells, myofibroblasts, and
      monocytes were examined using the real-time reverse transcription polymerase
      chain reaction. Epithelial cells and myofibroblasts were also cocultured using
      transwells. bLF transport, and IL-11 and BMP2 induction, as well as the
      interactions between the two cell types, were then analyzed after bLF treatment. 
      RESULTS: In vivo, oral bLF administration increased the production of IL-11 and
      BMP2 in intestinal specimens. In vitro, bLF only stimulated the production of
      IL-11 in human intestinal myofibroblasts; i.e., it had no effect on BMP2
      production in any cell type. In the transwell cocultures, bLF passed through the 
      epithelium and directly stimulated IL-11 production in the myofibroblasts on the 
      basolateral side. The IL-11 produced in the myofibroblasts subsequently acted
      protectively on the epithelial cells of the coculture. CONCLUSIONS: bLF
      upregulated the activity of anti-inflammatory factors, such as IL-11, in the
      intestine of a hepatitis mouse model and human intestinal myofibroblasts.

PG  - 365-74
LID - 10.1007/s00394-011-0221-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to better characterise the biological effects 
      of Lactobacillus salivarius ssp. salivarius CECT5713, a probiotic with
      immunomodulatory properties. METHODS: Live or dead probiotic was assayed in the
      TNBS model of rat colitis to determine whether viability was a requisite to exert
      the beneficial effects. In vitro studies were also performed in Caco-2 cells to
      evaluate its effects on epithelial cell recovery and IL-8 production. Finally,
      the probiotic was assayed in the LPS model of septic shock in mice to establish
      its effects when there is an altered systemic immune response. RESULTS: The
      viability of the probiotic was required for its anti-inflammatory activity. The
      probiotic inhibited IL-8 production in stimulated Caco-2 cells and facilitated
      the recovery of damaged intestinal epithelium. In LPS-treated mice, the probiotic
      inhibited the production of TNFalpha in plasma and lungs and increased the
      hepatic glutathione content. These effects were associated with an improvement in
      the altered production of the T-cell cytokines in splenocytes, by reducing IL-2
      and IL-5 and by increasing IL-10. Finally, it reduced the increased plasma IgG
      production in LPS-treated mice. CONCLUSION: The anti-inflammatory effects of
      viable L. salivarius ssp. salivarius CECT5713 are not restricted to the
      gastrointestinal tract.

TI  - Air pollution: An environmental factor contributing to intestinal disease.
PG  - 279-86
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2011.02.017 [doi]
AB  - The health impacts of air pollution have received much attention and have
      recently been subject to extensive study. Exposure to air pollutants such as
      particulate matter (PM) has been linked to lung and cardiovascular disease and
      increases in both hospital admissions and mortality. However, little attention
      has been given to the effects of air pollution on the intestine. The recent
      discovery of genes linked to susceptibility to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) 
      explains only a fraction of the hereditary variance for these diseases. This,
      together with evidence of increases in incidence of IBD in the past few decades
      of enhanced industrialization, suggests that environmental factors could
      contribute to disease pathogenesis. Despite this, little research has examined
      the potential contribution of air pollution and its components to intestinal
      disease. Exposure of the bowel to air pollutants occurs via mucociliary clearance
      of PM from the lungs as well as ingestion via food and water sources. Gaseous
      pollutants may also induce systemic effects. Plausible mechanisms mediating the
      effects of air pollutants on the bowel could include direct effects on epithelial
      cells, systemic inflammation and immune activation, and modulation of the
      intestinal microbiota. Although there is limited epidemiologic evidence to
      confirm this, we suggest that a link between air pollution and intestinal disease
      exists and warrants further study. This link may explain, at least in part, how
      environmental factors impact on IBD epidemiology and disease pathogenesis.

      bowel disease.
PG  - 316
LID - 10.1186/1471-2164-12-316 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is used to describe a state of
      idiopathic, chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. The two main
      phenotypes of IBD are Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The major
      cause of IBD-associated mortality is colorectal cancer. Although both
      host-genetic and exogenous factors have been found to be involved, the aetiology 
      of IBD is still not well understood. In this study we characterized thirteen
      Escherichia coli strains from patients with IBD by comparative genomic
      hybridization employing a microarray based on 31 sequenced E. coli genomes from a
      wide range of commensal and pathogenic isolates. RESULTS: The IBD isolates,
      obtained from patients with UC and CD, displayed remarkably heterogeneous genomic
      profiles with little or no evidence of group-specific determinants. No
      IBD-specific genes were evident when compared with the prototypic CD isolate,
      LF82, suggesting that the IBD-inducing effect of the strains is multifactorial.
      Several of the IBD isolates carried a number of extraintestinal pathogenic E.
      coli (ExPEC)-related virulence determinants such as the pap, sfa, cdt and hly
      genes. The isolates were also found to carry genes of ExPEC-associated genomic
      islands. CONCLUSIONS: Combined, these data suggest that E. coli isolates obtained
      from UC and CD patients represents a heterogeneous population of strains, with
      genomic profiles that are indistinguishable to those of ExPEC isolates. Our
      findings indicate that IBD-induction from E. coli strains is multifactorial and
      that a range of gene products may be involved in triggering the disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cases of cytomegalovirus colitis are exceptionally reported in
      immuno-competent infant. The pathogenesis is uncertain but breast-feeding is
      considered as a main source of postnatal infection. CASE PRESENTATION: Here we
      report a full-term, formula-fed infant who developed a severe cytomegalovirus
      anaemia and colitis when aged 2 months. CONCLUSION: Even if the molecular
      identity between the cytomegalovirus-isolate of the infant and the maternal virus
      could not be demonstrated, we confirmed through laboratory investigation that
      cytomegalovirus infection was acquired postnatally. However, the source of
      cytomegalovirus infection remained unclear. Alternative modes of cytomegalovirus 
      transmission are discussed.

      transduction pathways in rats with TNBS-induced recurrent ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1620-7
LID - 10.1016/j.intimp.2011.05.024 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in the
      therapeutic effects of proanthocyanidins from grape seeds (GSPE) on recurrent
      ulcerative colitis (UC) in rats. GSPE in doses of 100, 200, and 400mg/kg were
      intragastrically administered per day for 7 days after recurrent colitis was
      twice-induced by TNBS. The levels of GSH, as well as the activity of GSH-Px and
      SOD in colon tissues were measured by biochemical methods. The expression levels 
      of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and the nuclear translocation levels
      of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) in the colon tissues were measured by
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods. Western blotting analysis was used to 
      determine the protein expression levels of inhibitory kappa B-alpha
      (IkappaBalpha), inhibitor kappa B kinase (IKKalpha/beta), phosphorylated
      IkappaBalpha and phosphorylated IKKalpha/beta. GSPE treatment was associated with
      a remarkable increased the activity of GSH-Px and SOD with GSH levels in
      TNBS-induced recurrent colitis rats as compared to the model group. GSPE also
      significantly reduced the expression levels of TNF-alpha, p-IKKalpha/beta,
      p-IkappaBalpha and the translocation of NF-kappaB in the colon mucosa. GSPE
      exerted a protective effect on recurrent colitis in rats by modifying the
      inflammatory response and promoting damaged tissue repair to improve colonic
      oxidative stress. Moreover, GSPE inhibited the TNBS-induced inflammatory of
      recurrent colitis though blocking NF-kappaB signaling pathways.

TI  - Functional characterization of MIMP for its adhesion to the intestinal
      epithelium.
PG  - 2106-27
AB  - The micro integral membrane protein (MIMP), the domain within the integral
      membrane protein of Lactobacillus plantarum CGMCC 1258, has been shown to adhere 
      to mucin and antagonize the adhesion of enteroinvasive E. coli and
      enteropathogenic E. coli. To further characterize the functions of MIMP, we
      investigated its effects on the intestinal permeability, expression of tight
      junction (TJ) proteins and TJ ultrastructure in vitro and in vivo. We also
      determined the interaction between MIMP and dendritic cells (DCs). We observed
      that MIMP reduced intestinal permeability and restored the expression and
      distribution of TJ proteins in both NCM460 cell monolayers and in IL-10(-/-)
      mice. MIMP adhered to immature (i) DCs by binding to DC-SIGN, and induced DCs to 
      produce anti-inflammatory cytokines and to mediate Th2 differentiation. Moreover,
      MIMP stimulated the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines in colonic mucosa
      and attenuated colitis in IL-10(-/-) mice. In conclusion, MIMP is the main
      functional component of L. plantarum that contributes to its protective effects, 
      and thus may be a potential therapeutic agent for intestinal diseases.

TI  - Fecal bacteriotherapy for ulcerative colitis: patients are ready, are we?
PG  - 676-84
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21775 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fecal bacteriotherapy (FB) has been proposed as a safe and effective 
      alternative treatment for a number of gastrointestinal conditions including
      ulcerative colitis (UC). We performed a qualitative study to explore the
      attitudes and concerns of adult patients and parents of children with UC
      regarding FB as a potential treatment. METHODS: We conducted six focus groups for
      adult patients with UC and parents of children with UC or indeterminate colitis. 
      Participants were asked about their perceptions of and interest in FB as a
      treatment for UC. Sessions were recorded, transcribed, and reviewed to identify
      domains, themes, and major concepts. RESULTS: The focus groups included 15 adult 
      patients and seven parents of children with colitis. We identified five major
      domains pertaining to FB: impressions of treatment, benefits, risks, potential
      mechanisms, and social concerns. All but one participant expressed interest in FB
      and several wished it were already available. Participants compared FB to
      probiotics, felt it was "natural," easier than current therapies, and with donor 
      screening would be safe. Although initial distaste and the "yuck factor" were
      uniformly mentioned, these concerns were outweighed by perceived benefits.
      CONCLUSION: This is the first study to examine important ethical and social
      issues surrounding FB as a treatment for UC. Given adequate supporting research, 
      donor selection, and screening, adult patients and parents of children with UC
      will consider FB and are eager for it to become available. These findings have
      important implications for future microbiome-based treatments.

AB  - Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is a proinflammatory cytokine with
      pleiotropic effects. Currently, TNF-alpha inhibitors are approved by the Food and
      Drug Administration for a number of diseases including rheumatoid arthritis,
      juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn
      disease, and ulcerative colitis. We report a patient with seropositive rheumatoid
      arthritis with concurrent primary myelofibrosis, who had transfusion-dependent
      anemia and moderate thrombocytopenia that reversed during treatment with
      adalimumab. Rheumatoid arthritis and myeloproliferative disorder or
      myelodysplastic disorder often coexist, and treatment with standard
      immunosuppressants becomes complex. This report adds to the accumulating evidence
      of the safety of TNF-alpha inhibitors when primary myelofibrosis is present and
      generates discussion for further exploration of the potential therapeutic benefit
      of TNF-alpha inhibitors in cytopenias associated with primary myelofibrosis.

TI  - Clinical utility of probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 72-9
AB  - Many patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) use probiotics to manage this
      intestinal condition. Despite widespread use of these natural therapies by
      patients, health care providers may be unfamiliar with probiotics as a treatment 
      modality. This review describes the rationale for use of probiotics in IBD, the
      history behind current research directions, and recent controlled clinical
      studies in which efficacy of probiotics has been explored in patients with IBD.
      Emphasis is placed upon critical analysis of study designs for investigations
      that used lactic acid-producing bacteria or Saccharomyces boulardii in management
      of Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. While there is suggestion of benefit
      when patients with ulcerative colitis use bacterial therapies and when patients
      with Crohn's disease use S boulardii, small sample sizes and methodological flaws
      in study designs necessitate that additional investigations be conducted before
      probiotics can be routinely recommended in clinical practice.

PG  - 2149-52
LID - 10.1172/JCI58025 [doi]
LID - 58025 [pii]
AB  - Preclinical studies with probiotics continue to unravel mechanisms of
      cytoprotection and suggest that approaches utilizing microbial products as
      therapeutics in acute and chronic gastrointestinal disorders could be effective. 
      However, clinical trials using these bacteria have thus far been inconsistent. In
      this issue of the JCI, Yan et al. describe a novel mechanism of cytoprotection by
      p40, a soluble product of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, mediated via EGFR. The
      efficacy of p40 in three models of chemically induced colitis indicates
      tremendous therapeutic potential, though this finding will need to be verified in
      human patients.

TI  - Homocysteinemia and B vitamin status among adult patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease: a one-year prospective follow-up study.
PG  - 718-24
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21785 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to longitudinally study serum homocysteine 
      levels in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) in
      relation to disease activity and B vitamin status. METHODS: In all, 98
      consecutive adult patients (age 25-55 years) with CD (n = 70) and UC (n = 28)
      were enrolled and assessed at three timepoints over 1 year. RESULTS: There were
      no significant differences in levels of homocysteine, B vitamins, or dietary
      intake by disease type, disease activity, or across visits. 13% of all
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients had elevated homocysteine at least once
      during the study. Nine patients with CD had fluctuating homocysteine levels
      during the study but these were inconsistent, ranging from within normal range to
      elevated levels in any individual. Six of these nine patients were persistently
      in remission. 30% of all IBD patients had vitamin B6 deficiency, 11% had vitamin 
      B12 deficiency, and one patient (CD) had folate deficiency. All vitamins showed a
      significant correlation between intake and serum levels (B6; r = 0.46, P < 0.001,
      B12; r = 0.42, P < 0.001, and folate; r = 0.26, P = 0.008). There was an inverse 
      relationship between serum homocysteine in the blood and serum vitamin B12 (r =
      -0.241, P = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Serum homocysteine was mostly normal in patients
      with IBD and changed minimally over time. There was no association between
      disease activity and elevation of serum homocysteine. 30% of patients have
      vitamin B6 deficiency but vitamin B6 is not associated with elevated
      homocysteine. The routine measurement of homocysteine is not warranted.

TI  - Prevalence and management of anemia in children, adolescents, and adults with
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 513-9
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21740 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are
      more likely to have Crohn's disease (CD) than ulcerative colitis (UC) and their
      disease tends to be more extensive and severe than in adults. We hypothesized
      that the prevalence of anemia would therefore be greater in children and
      adolescents than in adults attending IBD outpatient clinics. METHODS: Using the
      WHO age-adjusted definitions of anemia we assessed the prevalence, severity,
      type, and response to treatment of anemia in patients attending pediatric,
      adolescent, and adult IBD clinics at our hospital. RESULTS: The prevalence of
      anemia was 70% (41/59) in children, 42% (24/54) in adolescents, and 40% (49/124) 
      in adults (P < 0.01). Overall, children (88% [36/41]) and adolescents (83%
      [20/24]) were more often iron-deficient than adults (55% [27/49]) (P < 0.01).
      Multivariate logistic regression showed that both active disease (odds ratio
      [OR], 4.7 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5, 8.8) and attending the pediatric
      clinic (OR 3.7; 95% CI, 1.6, 8.4) but not the adolescent clinic predicted iron
      deficiency anemia. Fewer iron-deficient children (13% [5/36]) than adolescents
      (30% [6/20]) or adults (48% [13/27]) had been given oral iron (P < 0.05); none
      had received intravenous iron compared with 30% (6/20) adolescents and 41%
      (11/27) adults (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Anemia is even more common in children 
      than in older IBD patients. Oral iron was given to half of adolescents and adults
      but, despite similar tolerance and efficacy, only a quarter of children with
      iron-deficient anemia. Reasons for the apparent underutilization of iron therapy 
      include a perceived lack of benefit and concerns about side effects, including
      worsening of IBD activity.

PG  - 328-33

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To highlight recent evidence supporting a concept that
      intestinal inflammation is a mediator or contributor to development of obesity
      and insulin resistance. RECENT FINDINGS: Current views suggest that
      obesity-associated systemic and adipose tissue inflammation promote insulin
      resistance, which underlies many obesity-linked health risks. Diet-induced
      changes in gut microbiota also contribute to obesity. Recent findings support a
      concept that high-fat diet and bacteria interact to promote early inflammatory
      changes in the small intestine that contribute to development of or
      susceptibility to obesity and insulin resistance. This review summarizes the
      evidence supporting a role of intestinal inflammation in diet-induced obesity and
      insulin resistance and discusses mechanisms. SUMMARY: The role of diet-induced
      intestinal inflammation as an early biomarker and mediator of obesity, and
      insulin resistance warrants further study.

      STAT3 phosphorylation in colon cells.
PG  - 6474-83
LID - 10.1021/jf2008925 [doi]
AB  - We studied a polyphenol-enriched cocoa extract (PCE) with epicatechin,
      procyanidin B2, catechin, and procyanidin B1 as the major phenolics for its
      anti-inflammatory properties against dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced
      ulcerative colitis (UC) in mice. PCE reduced colon damage, with significant
      reductions in both the extent and the severity of the inflammation as well as in 
      crypt damage and leukocyte infiltration in the mucosa. Analysis ex vivo showed
      clear decreases in the production of nitric oxide, cyclooxygenase-2, pSTAT-3, and
      pSTAT1alpha, with NF-kappaB p65 production being slightly reduced. Moreover,
      NF-kappaB activation was reduced in RAW 264.7 cells in vitro. In conclusion, the 
      inhibitory effect of PCE on acute UC induced by DSS in mice was attenuated by
      oral administration of PCE obtained from cocoa. This effect is principally due to
      the inhibition of transcription factors STAT1 and STAT3 in intestinal cells, with
      NF-kappaB inhibition also being implicated.

TI  - Yoghurt consumption regulates the immune cells implicated in acute intestinal
      inflammation and prevents the recurrence of the inflammatory process in a mouse
      model.
PG  - 801-11
LID - 10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-10-375 [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, two forms of inflammatory bowel disease, 
      are important problems in industrialized countries. The complete etiology of
      these two diseases is still unknown but likely involves genetic, environmental,
      and immunological factors. The aim of the present work was to determine whether
      the anti-inflammatory effects reported for yoghurt in acute trinitrobenzene
      sulfonic acid-induced intestinal inflammation in mice also could prevent or
      attenuate the recurrent intestinal inflammation, thus maintaining remission. The 
      innate response also was evaluated through participation of Toll-like receptors
      (TLRs) and the analysis of T-cell populations to determine the effects of yoghurt
      in an acute inflammatory bowel disease model. Yoghurt exerted a beneficial effect
      on acute intestinal inflammation by regulating T-cell expansion and modulating
      the expression of TLRs, with decrease of TLR4(+) and increase of TLR9(+) cells.
      The anti-inflammatory effect of yoghurt also was demonstrated in a recurrent
      inflammation model. Yoghurt administration during the remission phase prevented
      the recurrence of inflammation without producing undesirable side effects. The
      yoghurt effect may be mediated by increased interleukin 10 production and changes
      in intestinal microbiota.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diverticulitis due to diverticulosis of the colon is a common
      clinical problem with a high morbidity and socio-economic consequences. Frequent 
      clinical signs are flatulence, abdominal pain, stool problems which may often be 
      misinterpreted as the symptoms of an irritable bowel or a colitis. Accordingly,
      the diagnostic work-up must be adequate to allow for the stage-adapted planning
      and performance of the therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The following questions
      will be addressed in this review: What do we need to clarify diagnosis? Which
      antibiotics should be used? What is the best conservative approach for treatment?
      RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Basic conservative therapy consists of systemic
      antibiosis which can be extended by a topical antibiosis, and administration of
      aspirin as well as probiotics. The indications for a specific therapy is made on 
      an individual basis according to stage (Hansen and Stock). Above all, a "team
      approach" and close communication between gastroenterologists and surgeons are
      mandatory for adequate treatment of these patients.

TI  - Beneficial effects of probiotic bifidobacterium and galacto-oligosaccharide in
      patients with ulcerative colitis: a randomized controlled study.
PG  - 128-33
LID - 10.1159/000322977 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: In previous studies, we described the beneficial effects of
      bifidobacteria-fermented milk in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Here, we 
      examined the effects of a live Bifidobacterium breve strain Yakult, a probiotic
      contained in bifidobacteria-fermented milk, and galacto-oligosaccharide (GOS) as 
      synbiotics in UC patients. METHODS: Forty-one patients with mild to moderate UC
      were assigned to two groups; one group was treated with the synbiotics and the
      other was not (control). The treatment group ingested 1 g of the probiotic powder
      (10(9) CFU/g) three times a day, and 5.5 g of GOS once a day for one year. At the
      start and the end of this study, colonoscopic index and the amount of
      myeloperoxidase in a lavage solution were used as disease activity indices.
      Bacterial counts in the feces at the start and the end of this study were also
      examined. RESULTS: After a one-year treatment with the synbiotics, the clinical
      status of the UC patients as assessed by colonoscopy, significantly improved.
      Furthermore, the amount of myeloperoxidase in the lavage also decreased in these 
      patients after the synbiotic treatment. The synbiotics significantly reduced the 
      fecal counts of Bacteroidaceae and fecal pH. CONCLUSION: Administration of live
      B. breve strain Yakult and GOS can improve the clinical condition of patients
      with UC. These results encouraged us to perform a large-scale randomized,
      placebo-controlled trial.

TI  - Modified apple polysaccharide prevents against tumorigenesis in a mouse model of 
      colitis-associated colon cancer: role of galectin-3 and apoptosis in cancer
      prevention.
PG  - 107-17
LID - 10.1007/s00394-011-0194-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common and preventable
      cancers. Regular consumption of apples is conducive to reduction in CRC risk. AIM
      OF THE STUDY: To evaluate effects of modified apple polysaccharide (MAP) on
      tumorigenesis in a mouse model of colitis-associated colon cancer. METHODS: One
      hundred male ICR mice were administered with 1, 2-dimethyl-hydrazine (DMH) and
      dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Forty mice were given no further treatment, the
      rest were fed basal diet blended with three different doses of MAP; 2.5, 5, and
      10% (20 mice in each group). RESULTS: MAP significantly protected ICR mice
      against DMH/DSS-induced tumorigenesis. The incidence of tumor development was 90%
      (18/20) in the mice treated with DMH/DSS, but that was reduced to 25% (5/20), 15%
      (3/20), and 5% (1/20), respectively, in the mice treated with basal diets plus
      2.5, 5, and 10% of MAP. Study of apoptosis of colonic epithelial cells revealed
      that MAP moderately increased apoptosis, suggesting that the anti-tumor potency
      of MAP was probably attributed to its ability to induce apoptosis. Western blot
      analysis demonstrated that carbohydrate-binding protein galectin-3 changed in
      both the nucleus and the cytoplasm during the process from colitis to colon
      cancer in the model. And MAP could inhibit the binding of galectin-3 to its
      ligand: this is, at least in part, the possible mechanism of MAP by enhancing
      apoptosis and preventing tumorigenesis. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that MAP 
      has a potential role in clinical prevention and treatment for colon cancer.

LID - 10.1159/000323456 [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis represent distinct phenotypic forms of
      inflammatory bowel disease and continue to be a common cause of morbidity. The
      corticosteroids and the immunomodulatory drugs, which are the basis of treatment 
      for the inflammatory bowel diseases, do not assure always satisfactory outcomes. 
      Nutrition has been used in order to modify the inflammatory response of various
      chronic inflammatory diseases, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. 
      In the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases, the intestinal microflora and
      the intestinal mucosal disorders play a crucial role. Also, the release of
      reactive oxygen species is a significant factor of initiation and preservation of
      the inflammatory reaction in these diseases. The advantages of the nutritional
      treatment derive from the sequestration of intraluminal agents which may promote 
      the inflammatory bowel response or, alternatively, nutrition is able to modify
      the immune response, reducing the uncontrolled inflammatory reaction.
      Furthermore, nutrition can enhance the mucosal barrier function and consists a
      significant source of antioxidants. This review focuses on certain nutritional
      components that modulate the inflammatory response of the bowel and aims to
      present a rational thesis regarding the use of nutritional agents in the
      management of inflammatory bowel diseases.

TI  - Analysis of proteomic changes induced upon cellular differentiation of the human 
      intestinal cell line Caco-2.

AB  - The human intestinal cell line Caco-2 is a well-established model system to study
      cellular differentiation of human enterocytes of intestinal origin, because these
      cells have the capability to differentiate spontaneously into polarized cells
      with morphological and biochemical features of small intestinal enterocytes.
      Therefore, the cells are widely used as an in vitro model for the human
      intestinal barrier. In this study, a proteomic approach was used to identify the 
      molecular marker of intestinal cellular differentiation. The proteome of
      proliferating Caco-2 cells was compared with that of fully differentiated cells. 
      Two-dimensional gel analysis yielded 53 proteins that were differently regulated 
      during the differentiation process. Pathway analysis conducted with those 34
      proteins that were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time
      of flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis revealed subsets of proteins with common molecular
      and cellular function. It was shown that proteins involved in xenobiotic and drug
      metabolism as well as in lipid metabolism were upregulated upon cellular
      differentiation. In parallel, proteins associated with proliferation, cell growth
      and cancer were downregulated, reflecting the loss of the tumorigenic phenotype
      of the cells. Thus, the proteomic approach in combination with a literature-based
      pathway analysis yielded valuable information about the differentiation process
      of Caco-2 cells on the molecular level that contributes to the understanding of
      the development of colon cancer or inflammatory diseases such as ulcerative
      colitis--diseases associated with an imbalanced differentiation process of
      intestinal cells.

TI  - Saccharomyces boulardii improves intestinal cell restitution through activation
      of the alpha2beta1 integrin collagen receptor.
PG  - e18427
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0018427 [doi]
AB  - Intestinal epithelial cell damage is frequently seen in the mucosal lesions of
      inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease.
      Complete remission of these diseases requires both the cessation of inflammation 
      and the migration of enterocytes to repair the damaged epithelium. Lyophilized
      Saccharomyces boulardii (Sb, Biocodex) is a nonpathogenic yeast widely used as a 
      therapeutic agent for the treatment and prevention of diarrhea and other
      gastrointestinal disorders. In this study, we determined whether Sb could
      accelerate enterocyte migration. Cell migration was determined in Sb force-fed
      C57BL6J mice and in an in vitro wound model. The impact on alpha2beta1 integrin
      activity was assessed using adhesion assays and the analysis of alpha2beta1
      mediated signaling pathways both in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrated that Sb
      secretes compounds that enhance the migration of enterocytes independently of
      cell proliferation. This enhanced migration was associated with the ability of Sb
      to favor cell-extracellular matrix interaction. Indeed, the yeast activates
      alpha2beta1 integrin collagen receptors. This leads to an increase in tyrosine
      phosphorylation of cytoplasmic molecules, including focal adhesion kinase and
      paxillin, involved in the integrin signaling pathway. These changes are
      associated with the reorganization of focal adhesion structures. In conclusion Sb
      secretes motogenic factors that enhance cell restitution through the dynamic
      regulation of alpha2beta1 integrin activity. This could be of major importance in
      the development of novel therapies targeting diseases characterized by severe
      mucosal injury, such as inflammatory and infectious bowel diseases.

TI  - Cost of illness and disease burden in The Netherlands due to infections with
      Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O157.
PG  - 545-52
LID - 10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-10-252 [doi]
AB  - Infections with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O157 (STEC O157) are
      associated with hemorrhagic colitis, hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), and
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In the present study, we extend previous
      estimates of the burden of disease associated with STEC O157 with estimates of
      the associated cost of illness in The Netherlands. A second-order stochastic
      simulation model was used to calculate disease burden as disability-adjusted life
      years (DALYs) and cost of illness (including direct health care costs and
      indirect non-health care costs). Future burden and costs are presented
      undiscounted and discounted at annual percentages of 1.5 and 4%, respectively.
      Annually, approximately 2.100 persons per year experience symptoms of
      gastroenteritis, leading to 22 cases of HUS and 3 cases of ESRD. The disease
      burden at the population level was estimated at 133 DALYs (87 DALYs discounted)
      per year. Total annual undiscounted and discounted costs of illness due to STEC
      O157 infection for the Dutch society were estimated at euro9.1 million and
      euro4.5 million, respectively. Average lifetime undiscounted and discounted costs
      per case were both euro126 for diarrheal illness, both euro25,713 for HUS, and
      euro2.76 million and euro1.22 million, respectively, for ESRD. The undiscounted
      and discounted costs per case of diarrheal disease including sequelae were
      euro4,132 and euro2,131, respectively. Compared with other foodborne pathogens,
      STEC O157 infections result in relatively low burden and low annual costs at the 
      societal level, but the burden and costs per case are high.

TI  - Presence of intestinal Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) DNA 
      is not associated with altered MMP expression in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 34
LID - 10.1186/1471-230X-11-34 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) is suspected to
      be a causative agent in human Crohn's disease (CD). Recent evidence suggests that
      pathogenic mycobacteria and MAP can induce the expression of Matrix
      Metalloproteinases (MMP), which are the main proteases in the pathogenesis of
      mucosal ulcerations in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Within this study we
      assessed the prevalence of intestinal MAP specific DNA in patients with Crohn's
      disease, ulcerative colitis (UC), and healthy controls. We further analysed
      regulation patterns of MMPs in mucosal tissues of UC patients with and without
      intestinal MAP DNA detection. METHODS: Colonic biopsy samples were obtained from 
      63 Norwegian and German IBD patients and 21 healthy controls. RNA was quantified 
      by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to study MMP gene
      expression in both pathological and healthy mucosal specimens. The presence of
      MAP DNA in colonic mucosa was examined using MAP specific PCR. RESULTS: MAP DNA
      was detected in 20% of UC patients and 33% of healthy controls but only in 7% of 
      patients with CD. UC patients treated with corticosteroids exhibited a
      significantly increased frequency of intestinal MAP DNA compared to those not
      receiving corticosteroids. Expression of MMP-1, -2, -7, -9, -13, -19, -28 and
      TNF-alpha did not differ between UC patients with presence of intestinal MAP DNA 
      compared to those without. MMP-2, MMP-9 and MMP-13 were significantly decreased
      in UC patients receiving corticosteroids. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of intestinal
      MAP specific DNA is not associated with altered MMP expression in UC in vivo.
      Corticosteroids are associated with increased detection of intestinal MAP DNA and
      decreased expression of certain MMPs. Frequent detection of MAP DNA in healthy
      controls might be attributable to the wide environmental distribution of MAP and 
      its presence in the food-chain.

TI  - Dietary intake and risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic
      review of the literature.
PG  - 563-73
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2011.44 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasing.
      Dietary factors such as the spread of the "Western" diet, high in fat and protein
      but low in fruits and vegetables, may be associated with the increase. Although
      many studies have evaluated the association between diet and IBD risk, there has 
      been no systematic review. METHODS: We performed a systematic review using
      guideline-recommended methodology to evaluate the association between pre-illness
      intake of nutrients (fats, carbohydrates, protein) and food groups (fruits,
      vegetables, meats) and the risk of subsequent IBD diagnosis. Eligible studies
      were identified via structured keyword searches in PubMed and Google Scholar and 
      manual searches. RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included, encompassing 2,609 IBD 
      patients (1,269 Crohn's disease (CD) and 1,340 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients) 
      and over 4,000 controls. Studies reported a positive association between high
      intake of saturated fats, monounsaturated fatty acids, total polyunsaturated
      fatty acids (PUFAs), total omega-3 fatty acids, omega-6 fatty acids, mono- and
      disaccharides, and meat and increased subsequent CD risk. Studies reported a
      negative association between dietary fiber and fruits and subsequent CD risk.
      High intakes of total fats, total PUFAs, omega-6 fatty acids, and meat were
      associated with an increased risk of UC. High vegetable intake was associated
      with a decreased risk of UC. CONCLUSIONS: High dietary intakes of total fats,
      PUFAs, omega-6 fatty acids, and meat were associated with an increased risk of CD
      and UC. High fiber and fruit intakes were associated with decreased CD risk, and 
      high vegetable intake was associated with decreased UC risk.

PG  - 115-21
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2010.11.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To investigate the clinical effect of treatment with
      Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12
      (Probio-Tec AB-25) to maintain remission in patients with ulcerative colitis.
      METHODS: Patients with left-sided ulcerative colitis in remission - including
      proctitis and at least one relapse within the last year were randomised (2:1) in 
      a double-blind placebo-controlled study to Probio-Tec AB-25 or placebo for 52
      weeks. The patients were evaluated clinically, endoscopically and histologically 
      at entry and if relapsing. No other medication for ulcerative colitis than the
      study drug was allowed during the study. Primary endpoint was maintenance of
      clinical remission, secondary endpoints comparisons of days to relapse, and
      safety and tolerability of the study drug. The concentrations of the probiotic
      bacterial strains in stool were analysed in a subset of patients. RESULTS:
      Thirty-two patients were randomised. Twenty patients received Probio-Tec AB-25
      and twelve patients received placebo. Five patients (25%) in the Probio-Tec AB-25
      group and one patient (8%) in the placebo group maintained remission after 1 year
      of treatment (p=0.37). The median time to relapse was 125.5days (range 11-391
      days) in the probiotic group and 104 days (range 28-369 days) in the placebo
      group respectively, (p=0.683). Probio-Tec AB-25 was overall well tolerated.
      CONCLUSIONS: In this small randomised placebo-controlled trial no significant
      clinical benefit of Probio-Tec AB-25 could be demonstrated in comparison with
      placebo for maintaining remission in patients with left-sided ulcerative colitis.
      A difference may be achieved in larger studies, but the clinical significance of 
      this would be questionable. This study was registered in ClinicalTrial.gov
      (NCT00268164).

PG  - 329-35
LID - 10.1017/S0029665111000097 [doi]
AB  - Nutritional assessment and dietary advice are fundamental to inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) patient management and all patients should have access to a
      dietitian. Newly diagnosed patients often think that their pre-illness diet has
      contributed to the development of their IBD. However, epidemiological evidence to
      support diet as a risk factor is lacking. How the diet contributes to the
      gastrointestinal microbiota is interesting, although the role is not yet clearly 
      defined. Nutritional problems in IBD are common. Malnutrition occurs in up to 85%
      of patients and weight loss affects up to 80% of patients with Crohn's disease
      and 18-62% of patients with ulcerative colitis. Nutritional deficiencies are
      prevalent, particularly in relation to anaemia and osteoporosis. Intestinal
      strictures can be problematic in Crohn's disease and limiting fibrous foods that 
      may cause a mechanical obstruction in the gastrointestinal tract is helpful.
      Patients often explore dietary exclusion to alleviate symptoms but such changes
      may be self-directed or inappropriately advised and can lead to further
      nutritional deficiencies. Some patients experience concurrent functional symptoms
      (e.g. abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, flatulence and diarrhoea) that can
      significantly affect quality of life. Recently, a group of poorly absorbed
      carbohydrates that occur naturally in the diet called fermentable oligo-, di-,
      mono-saccharides and polyols have been associated with functional symptoms by
      intestinal bacterial fermentation leading to rapid gas production, and an osmotic
      effect increasing fluid delivery to the colon. Emerging evidence indicates that a
      diet low in fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols can alleviate
      functional symptoms in IBD.

      mesalamine.
PG  - 111-6
LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S5392 [doi]
AB  - The aminosalicylates (5-ASA; also referred to as mesalamine-based agents) are
      considered as first-line in the maintenance of remission of mild to moderate
      ulcerative colitis (UC). Traditionally these agents have required a large pill
      burden and multiple daily dosing regimens which may account for the low adherence
      rates, especially in patients in remission. Extended-release mesalamine is the
      first once daily mesalamine product approved by the Food and Drug Administration 
      for the maintenance of UC remission. This review will examine the
      pharmacokinetics, dosing, efficacy, and safety data of extended-release
      mesalamine, and discuss the potential role of improving medication compliance and
      decreasing costs in UC maintenance.

TI  - Changes in immunohistochemical levels and subcellular localization after therapy 
      and correlation and colocalization with CD68 suggest a pathogenetic role of Hsp60
      in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 552-61
LID - 10.1097/PAI.0b013e3182118e5f [doi]
AB  - In an earlier work, the role of heat shock protein (Hsp60) in the pathogenesis of
      ulcerative colitis (UC) was suggested by its significant increase in the
      pathological mucosa parallel with an increase in inflammatory cells. More data in
      this direction are reported in this work. We analyzed by immunohistochemistry
      biopsies of colon tissue from 2 groups of patients with UC and treated with
      either 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) alone or in combination with a probiotic. We
      looked for inflammatory markers and Hsp60. Both the treatments were effective in 
      reducing symptoms but the group treated with both 5-ASA and probiotics showed
      better clinical results. Amelioration of symptoms was associated with reduction
      of both inflammation and Hsp60, a reduction that was most marked in the group
      treated with 5-ASA and probiotics. The levels of Hsp60 positively correlated with
      those of CD68-positive cells, and double immunofluorescence showed a high index
      of colocalization of the chaperonin and CD68 in lamina propria. Immunoelectron
      microscopy showed that Hsp60-classically a mitochondrial protein-was abundantly
      also present in cytosol in biopsies taken at the time of diagnosis, but not after
      the treatment. Our data suggest that Hsp60 is an active player in pathogenesis of
      UC and it can be hypothesized that the chaperonin is responsible, at least in
      part, for initiation and maintenance of disease.

TI  - Probiotic sonicates selectively induce mucosal immune cells apoptosis through
      ceramide generation via neutral sphingomyelinase.
PG  - e16953
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0016953 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics appear to be beneficial in inflammatory bowel disease, but
      their mechanism of action is incompletely understood. We investigated whether
      probiotic-derived sphingomyelinase mediates this beneficial effect.
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Neutral sphingomyelinase (NSMase) activity was
      measured in sonicates of the probiotic L. brevis (LB) and S. thermophilus (ST)
      and the non-probiotic E. coli (EC) and E. faecalis (EF). Lamina propria
      mononuclear cells (LPMC) were obtained from patients with Crohn's disease (CD)
      and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from
      healthy volunteers, analysing LPMC and PBMC apoptosis susceptibility, reactive
      oxygen species (ROS) generation and JNK activation. In some experiments,
      sonicates were preincubated with GSH or GW4869, a specific NSMase inhibitor.
      NSMase activity of LB and ST was 10-fold that of EC and EF sonicates. LB and ST
      sonicates induced significantly more apoptosis of CD and UC than control LPMC,
      whereas EC and EF sonicates failed to induce apoptosis. Pre-stimulation with
      anti-CD3/CD28 induced a significant and time-dependent increase in LB-induced
      apoptosis of LPMC and PBMC. Exposure to LB sonicates resulted in JNK activation
      and ROS production by LPMC. NSMase activity of LB sonicates was completely
      abrogated by GW4869, causing a dose-dependent reduction of LB-induced apoptosis. 
      LB and ST selectively induced immune cell apoptosis, an effect dependent on the
      degree of cell activation and mediated by bacterial NSMase. CONCLUSIONS: These
      results suggest that induction of immune cell apoptosis is a mechanism of action 
      of some probiotics, and that NSMase-mediated ceramide generation contributes to
      the therapeutic effects of probiotics.

      implications.
PG  - 719-30
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2011.51 [doi]
AB  - Chronic inflammatory diseases, depending upon the duration and severity, are
      frequently associated with an increased risk of developing cancer. A classic
      paradigm is the enhanced risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Carcinogenesis is a multifactorial process that
      involves accumulation of genetic defects, protein modification, and cell-matrix
      interaction. In this review, we discuss aspects of chronic inflammation in IBD
      that influence the development of CRC and highlight the key molecular mediators
      involved in this process. Also, we identify potential targets that could
      facilitate earlier detection of dysplasia. The targeted manipulation of specific 
      molecules or pathways could provide opportunities for the development of
      therapeutic and chemopreventive interventions, which may prove effective in
      arresting the progression of colitis-associated cancer (CAC), with clinical
      implications.

AB  - High consumption of potatoes, soft drinks, cornflakes, chocolates, mushrooms and 
      other common examples of complex carbohydrates in the western side of the globe
      is significant. Similarly, Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) (Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis) are also prevalent in these regions. Evidence exists to
      support that factors, such as lack of zinc (it is common in patients with IBD, in
      particular Crohn's patients) may significantly affect the activity of some
      enzymes, such as, disaccharidases and other digesting enzymes of carbohydrates
      and that would lead to the recruitment of incompletely digested carbohydrates to 
      the terminal ileum and continual stimulation of the immune-response accordingly. 
      This concept may explain the observation of the existence of higher significant
      percentage of severe disease in Caucasian patients with IBD comparable with the
      respected Asian patients who consume less.

TI  - Impact of fatty acid status on immune function of children in low-income
      countries.
PG  - 89-98
LID - 10.1111/j.1740-8709.2011.00313.x [doi]
AB  - In vitro and animal studies point to numerous mechanisms by which fatty acids,
      especially long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA), can modulate the
      innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. These data strongly suggest that
      improving the fatty acid supply of young children in low-income countries might
      have immune benefits. Unfortunately, there have been virtually no studies of
      fatty acid/immune interactions in such settings. Clinical trial registers list
      over 150 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving PUFAs, only one in a
      low-income setting (the Gambia). We summarize those results here. There was
      evidence for improved growth and nutritional status, but the primary end point of
      chronic environmental enteropathy showed no benefit, possibly because the infants
      were still substantially breastfed. In high-income settings, there have been RCTs
      with fatty acids (usually LCPUFAs) in relation to 18 disease end points, for some
      of which there have been numerous trials (asthma, inflammatory bowel disease and 
      rheumatoid arthritis). For these diseases, the evidence is judged reasonable for 
      risk reduction for childhood asthma (but not in adults), as yielding possible
      benefit in Crohn's disease (insufficient evidence in ulcerative colitis) and for 
      convincing evidence for rheumatoid arthritis at sufficient dose levels, though
      formal meta-analyses are not yet available. This analysis suggests that fatty
      acid interventions could yield immune benefits in children in poor settings,
      especially in non-breastfed children and in relation to inflammatory conditions
      such as persistent enteropathy. Benefits might include improved responses to
      enteric vaccines, which frequently perform poorly in low-income settings, and
      these questions merit randomized trials.

TI  - Effects of an oral supplementation of germinated barley foodstuff on serum tumour
      necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6 and -8 in patients with ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 233-7
LID - 10.1258/acb.2010.010093 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of germinated barley foodstuff (GBF) on tumour necrosis 
      factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and -8 (IL-8) in patients with
      ulcerative colitis (UC) has not yet been examined. The aim of the present study
      was to determine the effect of administration of GBF on serum TNF-alpha, IL-6 and
      -8 levels in UC patients in remission. METHODS: Forty-one patients with UC were
      divided into two groups, namely control and GBF group. Twenty-one patients in the
      control group received standard treatment while 20 patients in the GBF group
      received 30 g of GBF daily by oral administration during two months of the study 
      along with standard drug therapy. RESULTS: Levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and -8 all
      decreased in the GBF group compared with baseline during the two-month study,
      while in the control group all values rose. For IL-6 and -8 this effect was
      significant, P = 0.034 and 0.013, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the
      present study showed that the consumption of GBF may reduce the level of serum
      TNF-alpha, IL-6 and -8 in patients with UC. This investigation was designed as a 
      pilot study and the results may provide a basis for more future clinical trials.

TI  - Upregulation of P-glycoprotein by probiotics in intestinal epithelial cells and
      in the dextran sulfate sodium model of colitis in mice.
PG  - G1115-23
LID - 10.1152/ajpgi.00027.2011 [doi]
AB  - P-glycoprotein (P-gp) mediates efflux of xenobiotics and bacterial toxins from
      the intestinal mucosa into the lumen. Dysregulation of P-gp has been implicated
      in inflammatory bowel disease. Certain probiotics have been shown to be effective
      in treating inflammatory bowel disease. However, direct effects of probiotics on 
      P-gp are not known. Current studies examined the effects of Lactobacilli on P-gp 
      function and expression in intestinal epithelial cells. Caco-2 monolayers and a
      mouse model of dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis were utilized. P-gp
      activity was measured as verapamil-sensitive [(3)H]digoxin transepithelial flux. 
      Multidrug resistant 1 (MDR1)/P-gp expression was measured by real-time
      quantitative PCR and immunoblotting. Culture supernatant (CS; 1:10 or 1:50, 24 h)
      of Lactobacillus acidophilus or Lactobacillus rhamnosus treatment of
      differentiated Caco-2 monolayers (21 days postplating) increased ( approximately 
      3-fold) MDR1/P-gp mRNA and protein levels. L. acidophilus or L. rhamnosus CS
      stimulated P-gp activity ( approximately 2-fold, P < 0.05) via phosphoinositide
      3-kinase and ERK1/2 MAPK pathways. In mice, L. acidophilus or L. rhamnosus
      treatment (3 x 10(9) colony-forming units) increased mdr1a/P-gp mRNA and protein 
      expression in the ileum and colon (2- to 3-fold). In the dextran sulfate sodium
      (DSS)-induced colitis model (3% DSS in drinking water for 7 days), the degree of 
      colitis as judged by histological damage and myeloperoxidase activity was reduced
      by L. acidophilus. L. acidophilus treatment to DSS-treated mice blocked the
      reduced expression of mdr1a/P-gp mRNA and protein in the distal colon. These
      findings suggest that Lactobacilli or their soluble factors stimulate P-gp
      expression and function under normal and inflammatory conditions. These data
      provide insights into a novel mechanism involving P-gp upregulation in beneficial
      effects of probiotics in intestinal inflammatory disorders.

TI  - Lactobacillus bulgaricus OLL1181 activates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor pathway 
      and inhibits colitis.
PG  - 817-22
LID - 10.1038/icb.2010.165 [doi]
AB  - Increasing evidence suggests that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway has
      an important role in the regulation of inflammatory responses. Most recently, we 
      have shown that the activation of the AhR pathway by a potent AhR agonist
      inhibits the development of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis, a model
      of human ulcerative colitis, by the induction of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in the
      large intestine. Because several strains of probiotic lactic acid bacteria have
      been reported to inhibit DSS-induced colitis by unidentified mechanisms, we
      hypothesized that particular strains of lactic acid bacterium might have the
      potential to activate the AhR pathway, thereby inhibiting DSS-induced colitis.
      This study investigated whether there are specific lactic acid bacterial strains 
      that can activate the AhR pathway, and if so, whether this AhR-activating
      potential is associated with suppression of DSS-induced colitis. By using AhR
      signaling reporter cells, we found that Lactobacillus bulgaricus OLL1181 had the 
      potential to activate the AhR pathway. OLL1181 also induced the mRNA expression
      of cytochrome P450 family 1A1 (CYP1A1), a target gene of the AhR pathway, in
      human colon cells, which was inhibited by the addition of an AhR antagonist,
      alpha-naphthoflavon (alphaNF). In addition, mice treated orally with OLL1181
      showed an increase in CYP1A1 mRNA expression in the large intestine and
      amelioration of DSS-induced colitis. Thus, OLL1181 can induce activation of the
      intestinal AhR pathway and inhibit DSS-induced colitis in mice. This strain of
      lactic acid bacterium has therefore the potential to activate the AhR pathway,
      which may be able to suppress colitis.

TI  - Identification of genetic markers for differentiation of Shiga toxin-producing,
      enteropathogenic, and avirulent strains of Escherichia coli O26.
PG  - 2275-81
LID - 10.1128/AEM.02832-10 [doi]
AB  - Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O26 is one of the top five
      enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) O groups most often associated with hemorrhagic 
      colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) worldwide. STEC O26 is considered to 
      have evolved from enteropathogenic (EPEC) O26 strains through the acquisition of 
      Shiga toxin (Stx)-encoding genes. Our PCR data identified several STEC-like
      strains expressing all features of STEC except Stx production and carrying
      remnants of Stx phages that were probably derivatives of EHEC O26. EHEC and EPEC 
      O26 strains phenotypically resemble O26 EHEC-like and apathogenic E. coli O26
      strains and are therefore undistinguishable by cultural methods. A clear
      discrimination between the different O26 groups is required for diagnostics in
      patients and for control of food safety. To develop an assay for specific
      detection of EHEC and EHEC-like O26 strains, we used a high-throughput PCR
      approach for selection of discriminative genetic markers among 33 tested genes
      mostly encoding type III secretion system effector proteins. The genes ECs1822,
      nleH1-2, nleA, nleC, nleH1-1, nleG, nleG2, nleG6-1, nleG6-2, espJ, espM2,
      nleG8-2, espG, ent (or espL2), nleB, nleE, efa1, and espB were detected at
      different frequencies in O26 EHEC, EHEC-like, and EPEC strains, indicating the
      possible role of these genes in virulence of human pathogenic O26 strains. The
      espK and espN genes were detected only in EHEC and EHEC-like O26 strains. espK
      was present in 99.14% of EHEC and 91.14% of EHEC-like O26 strains and was hence
      the best candidate as a genetic marker for characterizing these pathogroups.
      These data were corroborated by a genotyping real-time PCR test based on allelic 
      discrimination of the arcA (aerobic respiratory control protein A) gene. The
      results indicate that a combination of molecular detection tools for O26 wzx
      (wzx(O26)), eae-beta, stx, espK, and arcA genotyping is highly discriminative for
      clear identification of EHEC and EHEC-like E. coli O26 strains. This simple
      diagnostic test might be applicable in hospital service laboratories or public
      health laboratories to test strains isolated from stools of patients suffering
      from diarrhea.

TI  - Maternal methyl-donor supplementation induces prolonged murine offspring colitis 
      susceptibility in association with mucosal epigenetic and microbiomic changes.
PG  - 1687-96
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddr044 [doi]
AB  - Developmental epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, have been recognized
      as potential pathogenic factors in inflammatory bowel diseases, the hallmark of
      which is an exaggerated immune response against luminal microbes. A methyl-donor 
      (MD) diet can modify DNA methylation at select murine genomic loci during early
      development. The components of the MDs are routinely incorporated into prenatal
      human supplements. Therefore, we studied the effects of maternal MD
      supplementation on offspring colitis susceptibility and colonic mucosal DNA
      methylation and gene expression changes in mice as a model. Additionally, we
      investigated the offspring mucosal microbiomic response to the maternal dietary
      supplementation. Colitis was induced by dextran sulfate sodium. Colonic mucosa
      from offspring of MD-supplemented mothers following reversal to control diet at
      weaning was interrogated by methylation-specific microarrays and pyrosequencing
      at postnatal days 30 (P30) and P90. Transcriptomic changes were analyzed by
      microarray profiling and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain
      reaction. The mucosal microbiome was studied by high throughput pyrosequencing of
      16S rRNA. Maternal MD supplementation induced a striking susceptibility to
      colitis in offspring. This phenotype was associated with colonic mucosal DNA
      methylation and expression changes. Metagenomic analyses did not reveal
      consistent bacteriomic differences between P30 and P90, but showed a prolonged
      effect of the diet on the offspring mucosal microbiome. In conclusion, maternal
      MD supplementation increases offspring colitis susceptibility that associates
      with persistent epigenetic and prolonged microbiomic changes. These findings
      underscore that epigenomic reprogramming relevant to mammalian colitis can occur 
      during early development in response to maternal dietary modifications.

AB  - AIM: To assess the anti-inflammatory effect of the probiotic Bifidobacterium
      lactis (B. lactis) in an adoptive transfer model of colitis. METHODS: Donor and
      recipient mice received either B. lactis or bacterial culture medium as control
      (deMan Rogosa Sharpe) in drinking water for one week prior to transfer of a mix
      of naive and regulatory T cells until sacrifice. RESULTS: All recipient mice
      developed signs of colonic inflammation, but a significant reduction of weight
      loss was observed in B. lactis-fed recipient mice compared to control mice.
      Moreover, a trend toward a diminution of mucosal thickness and attenuated
      epithelial damage was revealed. Colonic expression of pro-inflammatory and T cell
      markers was significantly reduced in B. lactis-fed recipient mice compared to
      controls. Concomitantly, forkhead box protein 3, a marker of regulatory T cells, 
      was significantly up-regulated by B. lactis. CONCLUSION: Daily oral
      administration of B. lactis was able to reduce inflammatory and T cells mediators
      and to promote regulatory T cells specific markers in a mouse model of colitis.

AB  - Escherichia coli O157:H7 has been responsible for multiple food- and waterborne
      outbreaks of diarrhea and/or hemorrhagic colitis (HC) worldwide. More
      importantly, a portion of E. coli O157:H7-infected individuals, particularly
      young children, develop a life-threatening sequela of infection called hemolytic 
      uremic syndrome (HUS). Shiga toxin (Stx), a potent cytotoxin, is the major
      virulence factor linked to the presentation of both HC and HUS. Currently,
      treatment of E. coli O157:H7 and other Stx-producing E. coli (STEC) infections is
      limited to supportive care. To facilitate development of therapeutic strategies
      and vaccines for humans against these agents, animal models that mimic one or
      more aspect of STEC infection and disease are needed. In this paper, we focus on 
      the characteristics of various mouse models that have been developed and that can
      be used to monitor STEC colonization, disease, pathology, or combinations of
      these features as well as the impact of Stx alone.

TI  - Long-term adjustment to living with an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis.
PG  - 193-9
LID - 10.1007/DCR.0b013e3181ff42d8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to describe long-term adjustment to life with 
      an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis after surgery for ulcerative colitis, to
      investigate the relationship of pouch function to adjustment, and to explore
      factors affecting quality of life. METHODS: A total of 369 patients treated
      between 1982 and 1993 were included in the study. Questionnaires designed to
      assess bowel (pouch) function (Oresland score) and disease-specific adjustment
      (Swedish version of the Ostomy Adjustment Scale), plus open-ended questions
      regarding quality of life, were sent by mail. Open-ended questions were analyzed 
      with qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: A total of 252 patients (84%)
      returned the disease-specific adjustment questionnaire (141 males/111 females);
      median age, 51 (range, 26-77) years; median follow-up, 15 (range, 10-21) years
      after construction of the ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. High adjustment ratings
      were found for all statements, with the maximum median score of 6 on 28 of the 36
      items. Items with the lowest ratings (median score, 5) pertained to things one
      would do if not for the IPAA, feeling free to travel, ability to enjoy sexual
      activities, comfort with body image, ability to laugh about awkward situations,
      confidence in the appliance, and whether the surgery helped with decisions on
      what things are most important in life. Participants with the lowest adjustment
      scores had low bowel function scores (P < .0001). Open-ended quality of life
      questions were answered by 150 patients (59.5%). The most important areas for
      quality of life were health, family, restroom access, and friends. Five
      categories emerged from the qualitative content analysis: living a "normal" life,
      food restrictions, physical limitations, influence of restroom access on social
      life, and being dependent on medical care. CONCLUSIONS: Most participants had
      adjusted well to life with an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis and considered life to
      be normal. Good public restrooms were important for quality of life. Improving
      pouch function may help patients adjust to the postoperative state, but deeper
      understanding of reasons for poor adjustment despite good pouch function is
      needed.

TI  - Development of a multiplex PCR for rapid detection of verocytotoxin-producing
      Escherichia coli O26 in raw milk and ground beef.
PG  - 13-7
LID - 10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-10-201 [doi]
AB  - Verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) O26 is an emergent pathotype that
      has caused an increasing number of sporadic cases and outbreaks of
      gastroenteritis, hemorrhagic colitis, and hemolytic uremic syndrome in the United
      States and Europe. Many cases are associated with the consumption of milk and
      undercooked or fermented meats. The stx(2) strains of VTEC O26 seem to be more
      likely to cause human infections than isolates expressing only stx(1). The
      isolation and identification of VTEC O26 from foods is labor intensive and
      time-consuming. We developed a multiplex PCR (M-PCR) assay for the identification
      and characterization of E. coli O26 VTEC and its detection in raw milk and ground
      beef. The method is based on the amplification of the wzx, stx(1), and stx(2)
      genes for the simultaneous detection of the O26 antigen and verocytotoxin types 1
      and 2. This M-PCR assay had a sensitivity of 10(8) CFU/ml when applied to a
      bacterial suspension and of 10(6) CFU/ml or g when applied to both inoculated
      milk and minced beef samples. This M-PCR assay also was highly specific, and
      results were consistently negative for negative controls (nonpathogenic E. coli
      strains, uninoculated milk and beef samples, and samples inoculated with the
      nontarget microorganisms). This method could be used for the rapid detection of
      E. coli O26 VTEC from foods and for the rapid identification and characterization
      of clinical and environmental isolates.

TI  - Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli in children: diagnosis and clinical
      manifestations of O157:H7 and non-O157:H7 infection.
PG  - 955-9
LID - 10.1128/JCM.02119-10 [doi]
AB  - Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), a cause of food-borne colitis and 
      hemolytic-uremic syndrome in children, can be serotype O157:H7 (O157) or other
      serotypes (non-O157). E. coli O157 can be detected by culture with
      sorbitol-MacConkey agar (SMAC), but non-O157 STEC cannot be detected with this
      medium. Both O157 and non-O157 STEC can be detected by immunoassay for Shiga
      toxins 1 and 2. The objectives of this study were first to compare the diagnostic
      utility of SMAC to that of the Premier EHEC enzyme immunoassay (Meridian
      Diagnostics) for detection of STEC in children and second to compare the clinical
      and laboratory characteristics of children with serotype O157:H7 STEC and
      non-O157:H7 STEC infections. Stool samples submitted for testing for STEC between
      April 2004 and September 2009 were tested by both SMAC culture and the Premier
      EHEC assay at Children's Hospital Boston. Samples positive by either test were
      sent for confirmatory testing and serotyping at the Hinton State Laboratory
      Institute (HSLI). Chart review was performed on children with confirmed STEC
      infection. Of 5,110 children tested for STEC, 50 (0.9%) had STEC infection
      confirmed by culture; 33 were O157:H7 and 17 were non-O157:H7. The Premier EHEC
      assay and SMAC culture detected 96.0% and 58.0% of culture-confirmed STEC
      isolates (any serotype), respectively, and 93.9% and 87.9% of STEC O157:H7
      isolates, respectively. There were no significant differences in disease severity
      or laboratory manifestations of STEC infection between children with O157:H7 and 
      those with non-O157 STEC. The Premier EHEC assay was significantly more sensitive
      than SMAC culture for diagnosis of STEC, and O157:H7 and non-O157:H7 STEC caused 
      infections of similar severity in children.

AB  - Salmonellosis caused by Salmonella enteritidis is an acute and in most cases
      zoonotic disease, but chronic human carriers are also known. Mostly, affected
      persons recover without treatment, but severe complications occur occasionally.
      For the first time we report a case of probably food-borne invasive Salmonella
      enteritidis infection with septic shock in a patient with Tacrolimus treatment,
      13 years after renal transplantation, probably acquired by uncooked ground pork

      disease.
PG  - 417-27
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2010.04541.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Up to one-third of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) do 
      not respond to, or are intolerant of conventional immunosuppressive drugs.
      Although biological agents are alternative treatments, they may not be suitable
      or available to some patients. AIM: To review the evidence for use of
      nonbiological drugs in the treatment of patients with IBD refractory to
      corticosteroids or thiopurines. METHODS: A literature search was performed using 
      PubMed for English language publications with predetermined search criteria to
      identify relevant studies. RESULTS: Published evidence from uncontrolled series
      and controlled clinical trials has been used to produce a practical approach
      relevant to clinical practice which incorporates the indication, optimal dose,
      and side effects of various therapies including tacrolimus, methotrexate,
      thalidomide, tioguanine, mycophenolate mofotil, leucocyte apheresis, nutritional 
      therapy, antibiotics, probiotics, allopurinol, rectal acetarsol and ciclosporin
      in the treatment of patients with refractory ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
      disease. Approaches to optimise thiopurine efficacy are also discussed.
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD refractory to corticosteroids or thiopurines may
      respond to alternative anti-inflammatory chemical molecules, but the evidence
      base for many of these alternatives is limited and further trials are needed.

PG  - 194-202
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2010.04515.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Andrographis paniculata is an herbal mixture used to treat
      inflammatory diseases. An extract of the herb, HMPL-004, inhibits TNF-alpha and
      IL-1beta, and prevents colitis in animal models. AIM: To determine the efficacy
      and safety of HMPL-004 in patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis.
      METHODS: A randomised, double-blind, multicentre, 8-week parallel group study was
      conducted using HMPL-004 1200 mg/day compared with 4500 mg/day of slow release
      mesalazine (mesalamine) granules in patients with mild-to-moderately active
      ulcerative colitis. Disease activity was assessed at baseline and every 2 weeks
      for clinical response, and at baseline and 8 weeks by colonoscopy. RESULTS: One
      hundred and twenty patients at five centres in China were randomised and dosed.
      Clinical remission and response were seen in 21% and 76% of HMPL-004-treated
      patients, and 16% and 82% of mesalazine-treated patients. By colonoscopy,
      remission and response were seen in 28% and 74% of HMPL-004-treated patients and 
      24% and 71% of mesalazine-treated patients, respectively. There was no
      significant difference between the two treatment groups. CONCLUSION: HMPL-004 may
      be an efficacious alternative to mesalazine in ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Verocytotoxigenic (Shiga toxin-producing) Escherichia coli: virulence factors and
      pathogenicity in the farm to fork paradigm.
PG  - 357-65
LID - 10.1089/fpd.2010.0699 [doi]
AB  - Verocytotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC) are a good example of the evolution and
      emergence of pathogenic E. coli. Unknown before the late 1970s, these bacteria
      are a major cause of hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome worldwide.
      The production of verocytotoxins is the main virulence feature of VTEC but cannot
      be solely responsible for full pathogenicity. VTEC associated with severe human
      disease are usually capable of colonizing the intestinal mucosa with a
      characteristic attaching-and-effacing mechanism, genetically governed by the
      locus of enterocyte effacement, and possess other mobile genetic elements
      carrying additional virulence genes such as plasmids, phages, and pathogenicity
      islands (e.g., O-I 122). Despite the huge amount of data collected after the
      sequencing of the full genome of VTEC O157, the virulence and the evolution of
      the different VTEC serotypes have only been partially unraveled. A greater
      understanding of the factors governing the development of severe disease in
      humans and the colonization of animal hosts must be achieved before effective
      intervention strategies aimed at the reduction of the burden of infection can be 
      developed. Defining all the factors characterizing a fully pathogenic VTEC strain
      will be crucial to improve the efficacy of the diagnosis of human infections, the
      surveillance of animal reservoirs, the assessment of public health risks, and the
      development of control interventions. An overview of the VTEC virulence factors, 
      including their genetic basis and function, would start this process and is the
      objective of this article.

      that has been described globally but has the highest frequency in a cluster
      population in Puerto Rico. HPS patients also have major organ involvement that
      typically includes pulmonary fibrosis and granulomatous colitis. Rarely have
      cardiomyopathy and renal dysfunction been described. We report a case of the
      oldest historical patient with HPS type 6 and the associated gastrointestinal
      management.

AB  - AIMS: To investigate the effects of human gut micro-organisms on cytokine
      production by human intestinal cell lines. METHODS AND RESULTS: Quantitative
      real-time PCR assays were developed to measure the production of pro-inflammatory
      (IL-1alpha, IL-6, IL-18 and TNFalpha) and anti-inflammatory (TGF-beta1,
      TGF-beta2, TGF-beta3, IL-4 and IL-10) cytokines in HT-29 and Caco-2 cell lines.
      They were co-cultured with a range of mucosal bacteria isolated from ulcerative
      colitis patients, together with lactobacilli and bifidobacteria obtained from
      healthy people. HT-29 cells were also co-cultured with Campylobacter jejuni,
      enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), enteropathogenic E. coli and Salmonella 
      typhimurium. The majority of commensal bacteria tested suppressed the expression 
      of anti-inflammatory cytokine mRNA, increased IL-18, reduced IL-1alpha, and with 
      the exception of nonpathogenic E. coli, reduced TNF-alpha. All overtly pathogenic
      species increased both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine mRNA.
      CONCLUSION: Commensal and pathogenic species induced fundamentally different
      cytokine responses in human intestinal epithelial cell lines. SIGNIFICANCE AND
      IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Interactions between commensal bacteria tested in this study
      and the innate immune system were shown to be anti-inflammatory in nature, in
      contrast to the pathogenic organisms investigated. These data contribute towards 
      our understanding of how potential probiotic species can be used to suppress the 
      pro-inflammatory response in inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Variation in prevalence, diagnostic criteria, and initial management options for 
      eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases in the United States.
PG  - 300-6
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181eb5a9f [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Variation in the prevalence of eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases
      in different geographical regions has not been extensively studied. The aim of
      the present study was to define the regional and national prevalence of
      eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases, and differences in practice approaches.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: We administered a survey electronically to members of the
      American College of Gastroenterology, the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma,
      and Immunology, and the North American Society Pediatric Gastroenterology,
      Hepatology, and Nutrition. Questions pertained to the number and proportion of
      patients seen with eosinophilic gastroenteritis or colitis and eosinophilic
      esophagitis (EoE), and methods used to diagnose and treat these conditions.
      RESULTS: A total of 1836 physicians responded from 10,874 requests (17%
      response). Extrapolating responses from our US sample, we estimated an overall
      prevalence of 52 and 28/100,000 for EoE and eosinophilic gastroenteritis or
      colitis. The patient burden of EoE is higher in urban (0.58) and suburban (0.44) 
      compared with rural settings (0.36, P < 0.0065), observations consistent with
      other allergic disorders. There was also increased prevalence in northeast region
      when calculated by prevalence per 100,000. There was considerable variability in 
      criteria and initial treatment options used to diagnose EoE. Only one-third of
      respondents reported using diagnostic criteria proposed in a 2007 consensus
      document. Seventy-one and 35% of respondents reported treating some patients with
      EoE with a food elimination or elemental diet, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: EoE is 
      diagnosed more often in northeastern states and urban areas. There is
      considerable variability in diagnostic criteria and initial treatment approach
      supporting the need for additional clinical trials and consensus development.

TI  - Puberty is delayed in male mice with dextran sodium sulfate colitis out of
      proportion to changes in food intake, body weight, and serum levels of leptin.
PG  - 34-9
LID - 10.1203/PDR.0b013e3181ffee6c [doi]
AB  - In boys, inflammatory bowel disease often results in delayed puberty associated
      with decreased bone mineral density and decreased linear growth. Our goal was to 
      investigate whether pubertal timing and levels of leptin differed between
      prepubertal male mice with colitis and food-restricted (FR) mice maintained at a 
      similar weight. We induced colitis in 32-d-old male mice using dextran sodium
      sulfate (DSS), resulting in 10 d of worsening colitis. We followed up these mice 
      for separation of the prepuce from the glans penis as a marker of pubertal
      progression. Compared with free-feeding control mice, DSS and FR mice had
      significantly lower weight on d 7-10 of treatment. DSS mice had later puberty
      than control and FR mice. DSS mice also had smaller testes, lower FSH levels,
      increased systemic cytokines, and increased colonic inflammation by histology.
      Leptin levels were similar between DSS and FR mice, whereas both had decreases in
      leptin compared with controls. We conclude that DSS colitis causes delayed
      puberty in sexually immature male mice beyond what is seen among FR mice of
      similar weight, food intake, and leptin levels. These experiments provide support
      for the hypothesis that pubertal delay in colitis is influenced by factors beyond
      poor weight gain alone.

LID - 10.1097/MOG.0b013e3283400755 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The incidence of gastrointestinal infections continues to
      increase and infectious colitis contributes to significant morbidity and
      mortality worldwide. The purpose of this review is to highlight the recent
      advances in knowledge of pathogens causing infectious colitis. We describe the
      various pathogens and specifically focus on enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli
      (EHEC) O157:H7, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, and Entamoeba histolytica
      infections, and their impact on long-term effects, including postinfectious
      irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. RECENT FINDINGS:
      Salmonella, Campylobacter, and EHEC outbreaks continue to occur with disturbing
      regularity. Peanut butter and peppers were recently responsible for outbreaks of 
      nontyphoid Salmonella. Recent research has identified Salmonella genes required
      for colonization of various hosts and transposon-mediated differential
      hybridization was recently used to identify genes required during infection in
      different animal models. A number of other strains of EHEC in addition to O157:H7
      are emerging as serious threats to food safety in the USA. Campylobacter jejuni
      isolates are of interest because of absence of genes encoding for classical
      enterotoxins, and lack of plasmids encoding genes promoting bacterial invasion.
      Recent research has identified that the organism is able to invade and replicate 
      in infected epithelia via Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 and TLR-4. Also patients
      with infectious colitis, in particular Salmonella and Campylobacter, are at
      increased risk of postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel 
      disease on long-term follow-up. The paradigm of Entamoeba histolytica infection
      is changing with recent reports of detection of E. dispar deoxyribonucleic acid
      sequences, previously considered nonpathogenic. SUMMARY: There has been an
      explosion in the understanding of the epidemiology, pathobiology, and mechanisms 
      underlying infectious colitis. Additional studies to address prevention
      strategies and strict screening modalities for these infections are necessary.

TI  - Rectal administration of Lactobacillus casei DG modifies flora composition and
      Toll-like receptor expression in colonic mucosa of patients with mild ulcerative 
      colitis.
PG  - 1178-87
LID - 10.1007/s10620-010-1384-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: An imbalance in gut microbiota seems to contribute to the development
      of chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, such as
      ulcerative colitis (UC). Although it has been suggested that probiotic
      supplementation is an effective approach to colitis, its effects on intestinal
      flora and on mucosal cytokine balance have never been explored. AIM: To evaluate 
      the effect of Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) DG, a probiotic strain, on
      colonic-associated microbiota, mucosal cytokine balance, and toll-like receptor
      (TLR) expression. METHODS: Twenty-six patients with mild left-sided UC were
      randomly allocated to one of three groups for an 8-week treatment period: the
      first group of 7 patients received oral 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) alone, the 
      second group of 8 patients received oral 5-ASA plus oral L. casei DG, and the
      third group of 11 patients received oral 5-ASA and rectal L. casei DG. Biopsies
      were collected from the sigmoid region to culture mucosal-associated microbes and
      to assess cytokine and TLR messenger RNA (mRNA) levels by quantitative real-time 
      polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: 5-ASA alone or together with oral L.
      casei DG failed to affect colonic flora and TLR expression in a significant
      manner, but when coupled with rectally administered L. casei DG, it modified
      colonic microbiota by increasing Lactobacillus spp. and reducing
      Enterobacteriaceae. It also significantly reduced TLR-4 and interleukin
      (IL)-1beta mRNA levels and significantly increased mucosal IL-10. CONCLUSIONS:
      Manipulation of mucosal microbiota by L. casei DG and its effects on the mucosal 
      immune system seem to be required to mediate the beneficial activities of
      probiotics in UC patients.

TI  - Acute severe ulcerative colitis in children: a systematic review.
PG  - 440-9
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21383 [doi]
AB  - Pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC) has a more severe phenotype, reflected by more 
      extensive disease and a higher rate of acute severe exacerbations. The pooled
      steroid-failure rate among 291 children from five studies is 34% (95% confidence 
      interval [CI]: 27%-41%). It is suggested that corticosteroids should be dosed
      between 1-1.5 mg/kg up to 40-60 mg daily. Food restriction has a limited role in 
      severe UC and should be generally discouraged in children who do not have a
      surgical abdomen. Appraisal of radiologic findings in children must recognize the
      variation in colonic width with age and size. Data suggest that the Pediatric UC 
      Activity Index (PUCAI), determined at day 3, should be used to screen for
      patients likely to fail corticosteroids (>45 points), and at day 5 to dictate the
      introduction of second-line therapy (>65-70 points). Cyclosporine is successful
      in children with severe colitis but its use should be restricted to 3-4 months
      while bridging to thiopurine treatment (pooled short-term success rate 81% [95%
      CI: 76%-86%]; n = 94 from eight studies). Infliximab may be as effective as
      cyclosporine (75% pooled short-term response (95% CI: 67%-83%); n = 126, six
      studies) with a pooled 1-year response of 64% (95% CI: 56%-72%). In toxic
      megacolon, in patients refractory to one salvage medical therapy, and in chronic 
      severe disease, colectomy may be preferred. Decision-making regarding colectomy
      in children must consider the toxicity of medication consumed over many future
      years, the quality of life and self-image associated with either choice, as well 
      as both functional outcomes and, in females, fertility following pouch
      procedures.

TI  - Antioxidant properties of probiotics and their protective effects in the
      pathogenesis of radiation-induced enteritis and colitis.

AB  - Radiation therapy has become one of the most important treatment modalities for
      human malignancy, but certain immediate and delayed side-effects on the normal
      surrounding tissues limit the amount of effective radiation that can be
      administered. After exposure of the abdominal region to ionizing radiation,
      nearly all patients experience transient symptoms of irradiation of the bowel.
      Acute-phase symptoms may persist for a short time, yet long-term complications
      can represent significant clinical conditions with high morbidity. Data from both
      experimental studies and clinical trials suggest the potential benefit for
      probiotics in radiation-induced enteritis and colitis. On the other hand, it is
      well evidenced that both useful and harmful effects of therapeutic applications
      of ionizing radiation upon living systems are ascribed to free-radical
      production. Therefore, the hypothesis that probiotics reinforce antioxidant
      defense systems of normal mucosal cells exposed to ionizing radiation may explain
      to an extent their beneficial action. The aim of this review is threefold: First,
      to make a short brief into the natural history of radiation injury to the
      intestinal tract. Second, to describe the primary interaction of ionizing
      radiation at the cellular level and demonstrate the participation of free
      radicals in the mechanisms of injury and, third, to try a more profound
      investigation into the antioxidant abilities of probiotics and prebiotics based
      on the available experimental and clinical data.
