TI  - Characterization of Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli isolated from cases of
      diarrhoea & haemolytic uremic syndrome in north India.
PG  - 778-84
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Shiga toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is an
      important zoonotic foodborne pathogen, capable of causing haemorrhagic colitis
      (HC) and haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). As data from India on human infections
      caused by STEC are limited, this study was carried out for hospital based
      surveillance for STEC as a causative agent of diarrhoea, bloody diarrhoea and HUS
      at a tertiary care centre and to study the virulence gene profile and strain
      relatedness by multi locus variable tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). METHODS: A
      total of 600 stool samples were studied. Stool samples of every fifth patient
      presenting with non-bloody diarrhoea, all cases of bloody diarrhoea and diarrhoea
      associated HUS (D+HUS) were collected from October 2009 to September 2011. Stool 
      samples were cultured for STEC and characterization of STEC was done by
      serogrouping, virulence genes analysis, and MLVA typing. RESULTS: STEC were
      isolated as a sole pathogen from 11 stool samples [5 of 290 (1.7%) non-blood
      diarrhoea and 5 of 300 (1.6%) blood diarrhoea cases]. STEC was also isolated from
      one fatal case of HUS who was an eight month old child. Only six of 11 isolates
      were positive for stx2 gene, whereas stx1 was present in all 11 isolates. Only
      one isolate was positive for eae. Other adhesion genes present were iha in five
      isolates, followed by toxB and efa1 in two each and saa gene in one, isolate.
      Among the plasmid encoded genes, espP, hly and etpD were each present in one
      isolate each. In the MLVA typing, diverse profiles were obtained except two
      untypeable isolates from different patients shared the same MLVA profile. Both
      these isolates were not epidemiologically linked. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS:
      This study demonstrated that STEC could be a causative agent of diarrhoea, bloody
      diarrhoea and sporadic HUS. However, further work needs to be done to study and
      explore the prevalence of these organisms in the food chain in this region.

AB  - UNLABELLED: The most common presentation of cow's milk protein allergy (CMP) in
      infants is known as eosinophilic colitis (EC). The aim of this study is to
      evaluate EC characteristics in infants evaluated with colonoscopy due to the
      presence of rectorrhagia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective case-control
      study. Left-sided colonoscopy records of infants with persistent rectal bleeding,
      conducted between January 2006 and March 2011, were reviewed. The cases
      corresponded to infants with rectal biopsy compatible with EC and controls with
      negative biopsy. Telephone questionnaires to parents were conducted, evaluating
      personal and family history. RESULTS: Complete records were obtained in 61 (79%) 
      of the 77 procedures. 33 (54%) of them were males. Examination average age was
      6.3 +/- 5.9 months. 25 (41%) patients had EC on their histology. Between cases
      and controls, no significant difference in gestational age, birth weight and
      gender, only regarding age at the time of rectal bleeding, were observed. There
      was also no difference in personal history regarding obstructive bronchitis,
      allergic rhinitis, family history of asthma, allergic rhinitis or other food
      allergies. Those who received artificial feeding did not presented greater risk
      of EC. The most common symptoms in the cases did not differ significantly from
      the controls. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of EC in the children studied was
      40.9%. Our results show that there are groups of patients with persistent rectal 
      bleeding in which there is no personal or family history that helps diagnosing
      EC. An endoscopic study could be considered in these patients to establish a
      correct diagnosis of this condition, avoid unnecessary diets and not to delay the
      detection of other diseases.

      potential role in the differential diagnosis between Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis.

AB  - CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES: Focally enhanced gastritis and macrophage microaggregates
      are found in the upper gastrointestinal involvement of Crohn's disease, and may
      reflect an underlying defective innate immunity. These features, however, are
      also described in patients with Helicobacter pylori infection. The role of these 
      gastric abnormalities in the diagnosis of Crohn's disease was assessed in a
      population with high prevalence of H. pylori infection. METHODS: Thirty-seven
      Crohn's disease, 26 ulcerative colitis, and 30 control patients were included.
      The H. pylori status was evaluated by the rapid urease test and histology. The
      presence of focally enhanced gastritis and macrophage microaggregates was
      recorded. RESULTS: Focally enhanced gastritis was present in 24% of Crohn's
      disease patients, 4% of ulcerative colitis patients and 11.5% of controls,
      presenting an overall sensitivity and specificity for Crohn's disease of 24% and 
      88%, respectively. Macrophage microaggregates were found in all groups, but were 
      only detected in ulcerative colitis and controls in association with H. pylori
      infection, with an overall sensitivity and specificity for Crohn's disease of 61%
      and 69%, respectively. In the absence of H. pylori infection, focally enhanced
      gastritis and macrophage microaggregates were significantly associated with
      Crohn's disease (P<0.02 and P = 0.001 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Focally
      gastritis and macrophage microaggregates are suggestive of Crohn's disease only
      in H. pylori-negative specimens.

AB  - In this overview, we describe the history of Shiga toxin (Stx)-producing
      Escherichia coli (STEC) in two phases. In phase one, between 1977 and 2011, we
      learned that E. coli could produce Shiga toxin and cause both hemorrhagic colitis
      and the hemolytic-uremic syndrome in humans and that the prototype STEC-E. coli
      O157:H7-adheres to and effaces intestinal epithelial cells by a mechanism similar
      to that of enteropathogenic E. coli. We also recognized that the genes for Stx
      are typically encoded on a lysogenic phage; that STEC O157:H7 harbors a large
      pathogenicity island that encodes the elements needed for the characteristic
      attaching and effacing lesion; and that the most severe cases of human disease
      are linked to production of Stx type 2a, not Stx type 1a. Phase two began with a 
      large food-borne outbreak of hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic-uremic syndrome in
      Germany in 2011. That outbreak was caused by a novel strain consisting of
      enteroaggregative E. coli O104:H4 transduced by a Stx2a-converting phage. From
      this outbreak we learned that any E. coli strain that can adhere tightly to the
      human bowel (either by a biofilm-like mechanism as in E. coli O104:H4 or by an
      attaching and effacing mechanism as in E. coli O157:H7) can cause severe
      diarrheal and systemic illness when it acquires the capacity to produce Stx2a.
      This overview provides the basis for the review of current information regarding 
      these fascinating and complex pathogens.

AB  - Clostridium difficile is mainly a nosocomial pathogen and is a significant cause 
      of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. It is also implicated in the majority of cases
      of pseudomembranous colitis. Recently, advancements in next generation sequencing
      technology (NGS) have highlighted the extent of damage to the gut microbiota
      caused by broad-spectrum antibiotics, often resulting in C. difficile infection
      (CDI). Currently the treatment of choice for CDI involves the use of
      metronidazole and vancomycin. However, recurrence and relapse of CDI, even after 
      rounds of metronidazole/vancomycin administration is a problem that must be
      addressed. The efficacy of alternative antibiotics such as fidaxomicin,
      rifaximin, nitazoxanide, ramoplanin and tigecycline, as well as faecal microbiota
      transplantation has been assessed and some have yielded positive outcomes against
      C. difficile. Some bacteriocins have also shown promising effects against C.
      difficile in recent years. In light of this, the potential for emerging treatment
      options and efficacy of anti-C. difficile vaccines are discussed in this review.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Many Chinese herbs are traditionally used as
      medicine to improve the functions of gastrointestinal tract. Some of these herbs 
      are also promising agents for the improvement of the gut microbiota and the
      treatment of ulcerative colitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: By screening seven
      traditional Chinese herbs, we found that Red Ginseng and Semen Coicis were the
      most effective in promoting the growth of probiotics including Lactobacillus and 
      Bifidobacterium in vitro. We then evaluated the effects of Red Ginseng and Semen 
      Coicis on the growth of the bacterial pathogens (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus
      aureus, and Salmonella spp.) in vitro. In in vivo experiment, we gavage
      administrated trinitro-benzene-sulfonic acid induced ulcerative colitis (UC) rats
      with Red Ginseng and Semen Coicis extracts. After two weeks treatment, we
      analyzed the structure of the gut microbiota and examined the UC symptoms by
      employing qPCR and animal pathology detection techniques. RESULTS: Both Red
      Ginseng and Semen Coicis promoted the growth of probiotics - Bifidobacterium and 
      Lactobacillus in vitro. Red Ginseng also inhibited the growth of some pathogen
      strains. In vivo, Red Ginseng and Semen Coicis improved the structure of gut
      microbiota and relieved the symptoms of ulcerative colitis in vivo. Compared with
      Semen Coicis, Red Ginseng was more effective in relieving the symptoms of
      ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Red Ginseng could promote the growth of
      probiotic bacteria in vitro. Red Ginseng and, to a lesser extent Semen Coicis,
      gave positive results in an experimental in vivo model for ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Probiotics for antibiotic-associated diarrhea: do we have a verdict?
PG  - 17788-95
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i47.17788 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics use has increased tremendously over the past ten years. This was
      coupled with a surge of data relating their importance in clinical practice.
      Antibiotic-associated diarrhea, whose frequency has risen recently, was one of
      the earliest targets with data published more than ten years ago. Unfortunately, 
      available trials suffer from severe discrepancies associated with variability and
      heterogeneity of several factors. Most published randomized controlled trials and
      subsequent meta-analyses suggest benefit for probiotics in the prevention of
      antibiotic-associated diarrhea. The same seems to also apply when the data is
      examined for Clostridium difficile-associated colitis. However, the largest
      randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to date examining the use of a
      certain preparation of probiotics in antibiotic-associated diarrhea showed
      disappointing results, but it was flawed with several drawbacks. The commonest
      species of probiotics studied across most trials is Lactobacillus; however, other
      types have also shown similar benefit. Probiotics have enjoyed an impeccable
      safety reputation. Despite a few reports of severe infections sometimes leading
      to septicemia, most of the available trials confirm their harmless behavior and
      show similar adverse events compared to placebo. Since a consensus dictating its 
      use is still lacking, it would be advisable at this point to suggest prophylactic
      use of probiotics to certain patients at risk for antibiotic-associated diarrhea 
      or to those who suffered previous episodes.

TI  - The probiotic mixture VSL#3 dampens LPS-induced chemokine expression in human
      dendritic cells by inhibition of STAT-1 phosphorylation.
PG  - e115676
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0115676 [doi]
AB  - VSL#3, a mixture of 8 different probiotic bacteria, has successfully been used in
      the clinic to treat Ulcerative Colitis. We previously identified the modulation
      of chemokines as a major mechanism in the protective effect of the VSL#3 in a
      mouse model of colitis. This was supported by in vitro studies that implicated a 
      role for VSL#3 in the suppression of LPS-induced chemokine production by mouse
      bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DC). Herein, we validated these findings
      employing human monocyte-derived DC. Stimulation of human DC with LPS, VSL#3, or 
      a combination of both resulted in their maturation, evident from enhanced
      expression of activation markers on the cell-surface, as well as the induction of
      various chemokines and cytokines. Interestingly, a set of LPS-induced chemokines 
      was identified that were suppressed by VSL#3. These included CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL2,
      CCL7, and CCL8. In silico approaches identified STAT-1 as a dominant regulator of
      these chemokines, and this was confirmed by demonstrating that LPS-induced
      phosphorylation of this transcription factor was inhibited by VSL#3. This
      indicates that VSL#3 may contribute to the control of inflammation by selective
      suppression of STAT-1 induced chemokines.

TI  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli colonization of human colonic epithelium in
      vitro and ex vivo.
PG  - 942-9
LID - 10.1128/IAI.02928-14 [doi]
AB  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is an important foodborne pathogen
      causing gastroenteritis and more severe complications, such as hemorrhagic
      colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome. Pathology is most pronounced in the colon,
      but to date there is no direct clinical evidence showing EHEC binding to the
      colonic epithelium in patients. In this study, we investigated EHEC adherence to 
      the human colon by using in vitro organ culture (IVOC) of colonic biopsy samples 
      and polarized T84 colon carcinoma cells. We show for the first time that EHEC
      colonizes human colonic biopsy samples by forming typical attaching and effacing 
      (A/E) lesions which are dependent on EHEC type III secretion (T3S) and binding of
      the outer membrane protein intimin to the translocated intimin receptor (Tir).
      A/E lesion formation was dependent on oxygen levels and suppressed under
      oxygen-rich culture conditions routinely used for IVOC. In contrast, EHEC
      adherence to polarized T84 cells occurred independently of T3S and intimin and
      did not involve Tir translocation into the host cell membrane. Colonization of
      neither biopsy samples nor T84 cells was significantly affected by expression of 
      Shiga toxins. Our study suggests that EHEC colonizes and forms stable A/E lesions
      on the human colon, which are likely to contribute to intestinal pathology during
      infection. Furthermore, care needs to be taken when using cell culture models, as
      they might not reflect the in vivo situation.

TI  - IBD: microbiota manipulation through diet and modified bacteria.
PG  - 18-25
LID - 10.1159/000367821 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are both
      typified by an altered intestinal microbiota, and gene associations imply various
      defects in the mucosal barrier and in the innate immune response to bacteria.
      This review aims to assess how alterations in diet or use of modified bacteria
      could have therapeutic effects in CD or UC. METHODS: A MEDLINE search using the
      terms 'prebiotic', 'genetically modified bacteria', 'mucosal barrier in
      association with ulcerative colitis', 'Crohn's disease' or 'microbiota'. RESULTS:
      A large body of data from in vitro and animal studies shows promise for
      therapeutic approaches that target the microbiota. Approaches include dietary
      supplementation with fermentable fibres (prebiotics) and soluble fibres that
      block bacterial-epithelial adherence (contrabiotics), enhancement of the mucosal 
      barrier with phosphatidylcholine, and use of genetically modified bacteria that
      express IL-10 or protease inhibitors. Vitamin D supplementation also shows
      promise, acting via enhancement of innate immunity. Clinical trials have shown
      benefit with enterically delivered phosphatidylcholine supplementation in UC and 
      near-significant benefit with vitamin D supplementation in CD. CONCLUSION:
      Strategies that target the microbiota or the host defence against it appear to be
      good prospects for therapy and deserve greater investment.

LID - 10.1159/000367820 [doi]
AB  - The involvement of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBD is supported by 
      many findings and is thus now commonly acknowledged. The imbalance in the
      composition of the microbiota (dysbiosis) observed in IBD patients is one of the 
      strongest arguments and provides the rationale for a therapeutic manipulation of 
      the gut microbiota. The tools available to achieve this goal include fecal
      microbiota transplantation, but antibiotics and probiotics have been the most
      used one until now. Although antibiotics have shown some efficacy in inducing
      remission in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), as well as
      preventing postoperative relapse in CD, they are not currently recommended for
      the treatment of IBD except for septic complications, notably because of
      long-term tolerance and ecological issues. Some probiotics have been shown to be 
      as good as 5-aminosalicylic acid to maintain remission in mild-to-moderate UC,
      but have been disappointing until now in CD in all tested indications. In
      pouchitis, antibiotics and probiotics have shown efficacy for inducing and
      maintaining remission, respectively. Targeting the gut microbiota in IBD is an
      attractive strategy. Current efforts to better understand the host-microbiota
      interactions in physiological as well as disease settings might lead to the
      development of rational-based treatments.

TI  - Randomized clinical trial of the effect of gum chewing on postoperative ileus and
      inflammation in colorectal surgery.
PG  - 202-11
LID - 10.1002/bjs.9691 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postoperative ileus (POI) is a common complication following
      colorectal surgery that delays recovery and increases length of hospital stay.
      Gum chewing may reduce POI and therefore enhance recovery after surgery. The aim 
      of the study was to evaluate the effect of gum chewing on POI, length of hospital
      stay and inflammatory parameters. METHODS: Patients undergoing elective
      colorectal surgery in one of two centres were randomized to either chewing gum or
      a dermal patch (control). Chewing gum was started before surgery and stopped when
      oral intake was resumed. Primary endpoints were POI and length of stay. Secondary
      endpoints were systemic and local inflammation, and surgical complications.
      Gastric emptying was measured by ultrasonography. Soluble tumour necrosis factor 
      receptor 1 (TNFRSF1A) and interleukin (IL) 8 levels were measured by
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Between May 2009 and September 2012, 
      120 patients were randomized to chewing gum (58) or dermal patch (control group; 
      62). Mean(s.d.) length of hospital stay was shorter in the chewing gum group than
      in controls, but this difference was not significant: 9.5(4.9) versus 14.0(14.5) 
      days respectively. Some 14 (27 per cent) of 52 analysed patients allocated to
      chewing gum developed POI compared with 29 (48 per cent) of 60 patients in the
      control group (P = 0.020). More patients in the chewing gum group first
      defaecated within 4 days of surgery (85 versus 57 per cent; P = 0.006) and passed
      first flatus within 48 h (65 versus 50 per cent; P = 0.044). The decrease in
      antral area measured by ultrasonography following a standard meal was
      significantly greater among patients who chewed gum: median 25 (range -36 to 54) 
      per cent compared with 10 (range -152 to 54) per cent in controls (P = 0.004).
      Levels of IL-8 (133 versus 288 pg/ml; P = 0.045) and TNFRSF1A (0.74 versus 0.92
      ng/ml; P = 0.043) were lower among patients in the chewing gum group. Fewer
      patients in this group developed a grade IIIb complication (2 of 58 versus 10 of 
      62; P = 0.031). CONCLUSION: Gum chewing is a safe and simple treatment to reduce 
      POI, and is associated with a reduction in systemic inflammatory markers and
      complications. REGISTRATION NUMBER: NTR2867 (http://www.trialregister.nl).

TI  - A gut microbial metabolite of linoleic acid, 10-hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic acid,
      ameliorates intestinal epithelial barrier impairment partially via GPR40-MEK-ERK 
      pathway.
PG  - 2902-18

AB  - Gut microbial metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids have attracted much
      attention because of their various physiological properties. Dysfunction of tight
      junction (TJ) in the intestine contributes to the pathogenesis of many disorders 
      such as inflammatory bowel disease. We evaluated the effects of five novel gut
      microbial metabolites on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced barrier
      impairment in Caco-2 cells and dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in mice.
      10-Hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic acid (HYA), a gut microbial metabolite of linoleic
      acid, suppressed TNF-alpha and dextran sulfate sodium-induced changes in the
      expression of TJ-related molecules, occludin, zonula occludens-1, and myosin
      light chain kinase. HYA also suppressed the expression of TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2) 
      mRNA and protein expression in Caco-2 cells and colonic tissue. In addition, HYA 
      suppressed the protein expression of TNFR2 in murine intestinal epithelial cells.
      Furthermore, HYA significantly up-regulated G protein-coupled receptor (GPR) 40
      expression in Caco-2 cells. It also induced [Ca(2+)]i responses in HEK293 cells
      expressing human GPR40 with higher sensitivity than linoleic acid, its metabolic 
      precursor. The barrier-recovering effects of HYA were abrogated by a GPR40
      antagonist and MEK inhibitor in Caco-2 cells. Conversely, 10-hydroxyoctadacanoic 
      acid, which is a gut microbial metabolite of oleic acid and lacks a carbon-carbon
      double bond at Delta12 position, did not show these TJ-restoring activities and
      down-regulated GPR40 expression. Therefore, HYA modulates TNFR2 expression, at
      least partially, via the GPR40-MEK-ERK pathway and may be useful in the treatment
      of TJ-related disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) comprises of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Cohn's
      disease (CD) as two main idiopathic pathologies resulting in immunologically
      mediated chronic inflammatory conditions. Several bioactive peptides and hydro
      lysates from natural sources have now been tested in animal models of human
      diseases for potential anti-inflammatory effects. Eggshell membrane (ESM) is a
      well-known natural bioactive material. In this study, we aim to study the
      anti-inflammatory activity of ESM hydro lysate (AL-PS) in vitro and in vivo. In
      vitro, AL-PS was shown to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 secretion. In
      vivo treatment with AL-PS was shown to reduce dextran sodium sulphate
      (DSS)-induced weight loss, clinical signs of colitis and secretion of interleukin
      (IL)-6 (p < 0.05). In addition, treatment with AL-PS also attenuated the severity
      of intestinal inflammation via down-regulation of IL-10 an anti-inflammatory
      cytokine. This validates potential benefits of AL-PS as a novel preventative
      target molecule for treatment of IBD.

PG  - 2127-41
LID - 10.1007/s00726-014-1886-9 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), most commonly ulcerative colitis (UC) and
      Crohn's disease (CD), is a chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract.
      Patients affected with IBD experience symptoms including abdominal pain,
      persistent diarrhea, rectal bleeding, and weight loss. There is no cure for IBD; 
      thus treatments typically focus on preventing complications, inducing and
      maintaining remission, and improving quality of life. During IBD, dysregulation
      of the intestinal immune system leads to increased production of pro-inflammatory
      cytokines, such as TNF-alpha and IL-6, and recruitment of activated immune cells 
      to the intestine, causing tissue damage and perpetuating the inflammatory
      response. Recent biological therapies targeting specific inflammatory cytokines
      or pathways, in particular TNF-alpha, have shown promise, but not all patients
      respond to treatment, and some individuals become intolerant to treatment over
      time. Dietary peptides and amino acids (AAs) have been shown to modulate
      intestinal immune functions and influence inflammatory responses, and may be
      useful as alternative or ancillary treatments in IBD. This review focuses on
      dietary interventions for IBD treatment, in particular the role of dietary
      peptides and AAs in reducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in the
      gut, as well as recent advances in the cellular mechanisms responsible for their 
      anti-inflammatory activity.

LID - 10.1038/mi.2014.122 [doi]
AB  - Loss-of-function variants within the gene locus encoding protein tyrosine
      phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2) are associated with increased risk for
      Crohn's disease (CD). A disturbed regulation of T helper (Th) cell responses
      causing loss of tolerance against self- or commensal-derived antigens and an
      altered intestinal microbiota plays a pivotal role in CD pathogenesis. Loss of
      PTPN2 in the T-cell compartment causes enhanced induction of Th1 and Th17 cells, 
      but impaired induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in several mouse colitis
      models, namely acute and chronic dextran sodium sulfate colitis, and T-cell
      transfer colitis models. This results in increased susceptibility to intestinal
      inflammation and intestinal dysbiosis which is comparable with that observed in
      CD patients. We detected inflammatory infiltrates in liver, kidney, and skin and 
      elevated autoantibody levels indicating systemic loss of tolerance in
      PTPN2-deficient animals. CD patients featuring a loss-of-function PTPN2 variant
      exhibit enhanced Th1 and Th17 cell, but reduced Treg markers when compared with
      PTPN2 wild-type patients in serum and intestinal tissue samples. Our data
      demonstrate that dysfunction of PTPN2 results in aberrant T-cell differentiation 
      and intestinal dysbiosis similar to those observed in human CD. Our findings
      indicate a novel and crucial role for PTPN2 in chronic intestinal inflammation.

TI  - Vitamin D as a novel therapy in inflammatory bowel disease: new hope or false
      dawn?
PG  - 5-12
LID - 10.1017/S0029665114001621 [doi]
AB  - There is increasing scientific interest in the field of vitamin D research,
      moving the focus beyond bone health to other disease processes. Low circulating
      vitamin D levels have been reported as a risk factor for several
      pathophysiologically divergent diseases, including cancers, diabetes, CVD,
      multiple sclerosis and inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and 
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). But, therein, remains the challenge: can any
      single nutrient contribute to multiple complex disease mechanisms and,
      ultimately, have therapeutic potential? The aim of this review is to critically
      evaluate several strands of scientific evidence surrounding vitamin D and
      inflammation, primarily focusing on IBD. Epidemiological studies suggest an
      increased incidence of IBD and rheumatoid arthritis in countries of more northern
      latitudes, mirroring sunlight patterns. A considerable body of evidence supports 
      the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D, at least in animal models of IBD.
      Although it is accepted that suboptimal vitamin D status is common in IBD, some
      studies suggest that this associates with more severe disease. With regard to
      treatment, the data are only beginning to emerge from randomised controlled
      trials to suggest that people with IBD may remain in remission longer when
      treated with oral vitamin D. In conclusion, several strands of evidence suggest
      that vitamin D may modify the immune response in IBD. There is a continued need
      for large well-designed clinical trials and mechanistic studies to determine if, 
      and how, this emerging promise translates into tangible clinical benefits for
      people with chronic debilitating diseases such as IBD.

PG  - 194-201

AB  - The shiga-toxin (Stx)-producing human pathogen Escherichia coli serotype O157:H7 
      is a highly pathogenic subgroup of Stx-producing E. coli (STEC) with food-borne
      etiology and bovine reservoir. Each year in the U. S., approximately 100,000
      patients are infected with enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) of the O157:H7
      serotype. This food-borne pathogen is a global public health threat responsible
      for widespread outbreaks of human disease. Since its initial discovery in 1982,
      O157:H7 has rapidly become the dominant EHEC serotype in North America.
      Hospitalization rates among patients as high as 50% have been reported for severe
      outbreaks of human disease. Symptoms of disease can rapidly deteriorate and
      progress to life-threatening complications such as Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome
      (HUS), the leading cause of kidney failure in children, or Hemorrhagic Colitis.
      In depth understanding of the genomic diversity that exists among currently
      circulating EHEC populations has broad applications for improved molecular-guided
      biosurveillance, outbreak preparedness, diagnostic risk assessment, and
      development of alternative toxin-suppressing therapeutics.

AB  - Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens M1 (M1) has been shown to possess many different
      beneficial health effects including anti-colitis activity. The purpose of this
      study was to develop a novel and easily scaled-up encapsulating technique that
      would improve the temperature tolerance of the bacterium and reduce the
      sensitivity of the organism to gastrointestinal fluid. A mixture of sodium
      alginate, gellan gum and skim milk powder was used as a coating material to
      entrap M1. The M1 gel was then directly freeze dried in order to dehydrate the
      covering and form microcapsules. The viable cell numbers of M1 present only
      dropped ten folds after the freeze-drying encapsulation process. The viable cell 
      counts remained constant at 5 x 10(7) CFU/g after heating from 25 degrees C to 75
      degrees C and holding at 75 degrees C for 1 min. The viable cell counts were
      reduced to 10(6) CFU/g and 10(5) CFU/g after 8-week storage at 4 degrees C and
      subsequent heat treatment with simulated gastrointestinal fluid test (SGFT) and
      bile salts, respectively. The effect of encapsulated M1 on the organism's
      anti-colitis activity was evaluated using the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)
      induced colitis mouse model. An in vivo study indicated that administration of
      heat treated encapsulated M1 was able to ameliorate DSS-induced colitis producing
      a significant reduction in the bleeding score and an attenuation of inflammatory 
      score. These findings clearly demonstrate that encapsulation of M1 using this
      novel technique is able to provide good protection from temperature changes and
      SGFT treatment and also does not affect the organism's anti-colitis activity.

AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are intestinal disorders that
      comprise the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). These disorders have a
      significant effect on the quality of life of affected patients and the increasing
      number of IBD cases worldwide is a growing concern. Because of the overall burden
      of IBD and its multifactorial etiology, efforts have been made to improve the
      medical management of these inflammatory conditions. The classical therapeutic
      strategies aim to control the exacerbated host immune response with
      aminosalicylates, antibiotics, corticosteroids, thiopurines, methotrexate and
      anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) biological agents. Although successful in the
      treatment of several CD or UC conditions, these drugs have limited effectiveness,
      and variable responses may culminate in unpredictable outcomes. The ideal therapy
      should reduce inflammation without inducing immunosuppression, and remains a
      challenge to health care personnel. Recently, a number of additional approaches
      to IBD therapy, such as new target molecules for biological agents and cellular
      therapy, have shown promising results. A deeper understanding of IBD pathogenesis
      and the availability of novel therapies are needed to improve therapeutic
      success. This review describes the overall key features of therapies currently
      employed in clinical practice as well as novel and future alternative IBD
      treatment methods.

AB  - Chronic inflammation is an underlying risk factor of colon cancer, and NF-kappaB 
      plays a critical role in the development of inflammation-associated colon cancer 
      in an AOM/DSS mouse model. The aim of this study was to determine whether the
      standardized ethanol extract obtained from the aerial parts of Artemisia princeps
      Pampanini cv. Sajabal (EAPP) is effective at preventing inflammation-associated
      colon cancer, and if so, to identify the signaling pathways involved. In the
      present study, protective efficacy of EAPP on tumor formation and the
      infiltrations of monocytes and macrophages in colons of an AOM/DSS mouse model
      were evaluated. It was found that colitis and tumor burdens showed statistically 
      meaningful improvements after EAPP administration. Furthermore, these
      improvements were accompanied by a reduction in NF-kappaB activity and in the
      levels of NF-kappaB-dependent pro-survival proteins, that is, survivin, cFLIP,
      XIAP, and Bcl-2. In vitro, EAPP significantly reduced NF-kappaB activation and
      the levels of IL-1beta and IL-8 mRNA and pro-survival proteins in HT-29 and
      HCT-116 colon cancer cells. Furthermore, EAPP caused caspase-dependent apoptosis.
      Based on these results, the authors suggest EAPP suppresses inflammatory
      responses and induces apoptosis partly via NF-kappaB inactivation, and that EAPP 
      could be useful for the prevention of colitis-associated tumorigenesis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess the safety and efficacy of high-
      and low-dose oral, delayed-release mesalamine in a randomized, double-blind,
      active control study of children with mild-to-moderately active ulcerative
      colitis. METHODS: Patients ages 5 to 17 years, with a Pediatric Ulcerative
      Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) score of >/= 10 to </= 55 and a truncated Mayo
      Score of >/= 1 for both rectal bleeding and stool frequency, were enrolled. They 
      received body weight-dependent doses of oral, delayed-release mesalamine for 6
      weeks in a low- (27-71 mg . g(-1) . day(-1)) or high-dose group (53-118 mg .
      g(-1) . day(-1)). The primary endpoint was treatment success, defined as the
      proportion of patients who achieved remission (PUCAI score <10) or partial
      response (PUCAI score >/= 10 with a decrease from baseline by >/= 20 points).
      Secondary endpoints included truncated Mayo Score and global assessment of change
      of disease activity. RESULTS: The modified intent-to-treat population included 81
      of 83 patients enrolled. Treatment success by PUCAI was achieved by 23 of 41
      (56%) and 22 of 40 (55%) patients in the mesalamine low- and high-dose groups,
      respectively (P = 0.924). Truncated Mayo Score (low-dose 30 [73%] and high-dose
      28 [70%] patients) and other efficacy results did not differ between the groups. 
      The type and severity of adverse events were consistent with those reported in
      previous studies of adults with ulcerative colitis and did not differ between
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both low- and high-dose oral, delayed-release mesalamine
      doses were equally effective as short-term treatment of mild-to-moderately active
      ulcerative colitis in children, without a specific benefit or risk to using
      either dose.

TI  - Effects of enteral nutritional support on malnourished patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease by subjective global assessment.
PG  - 493-507
LID - 10.5152/tjg.2014.4955 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: To investigate the prevalence of malnutrition in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by subjective global assessment (SGA) and the
      effects of oral nutritional support on the clinical parameters, consumption of
      energy, macronutrients and fiber intake in the Study and Control groups,
      prospectively. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 38 (28 Male; 10 Female)
      hospitalized patients with moderate or severe IBD (13 with Crohn's disease (CD); 
      25 with Ulcerative colitis (UC)) were included. At stage 1, the disease severity,
      clinical symptoms and, signs, food consumption and nutritional status by using
      subjective global assessment (SGA) were recorded. At stage 2, the patients were
      blindly randomized into a Study Group and Controls. In the Study Group, a
      standard enteral product was added into the regulated hospital diets, but for the
      Controls, deficits were regulated by only hospital diets for 3 weeks. the
      independent variables were the group, the disease and its activity, age, Body
      body mass index (BMI), weight loss history, the hospitalization period; the
      dependent variables were SGA, bowel movements, change in nutritional status,
      disease severity, clinical findings, and also consumption of macronutrients.
      RESULTS: Prevalance of malnutrition (SGA-B or SGA-C) for all the patients was
      92.1% at the beginning and 71.1% at the end of study. Improvements in disease
      activity score for the patients with UC were statistically significant in both
      the Study Group and the Controls (p=0.006 for the Study Group and p=0.001 for the
      Controls, respectively). Macronutrients, total and water soluble fiber
      consumption levels improved, with statistically significant differences for all
      the groups. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of malnutrition is a major problem in
      patients with IBD. Not only the regulation of hospital food, but also enteral
      nutritional support, improved their levels of malnutrition, as well as their
      energy, macronutrients, and fiber consumption, and SGA is an easy method for
      nutritional monitoring.

TI  - Apple polysaccharide reduces NF-Kb mediated colitis-associated colon
      carcinogenesis.
PG  - 177-90
LID - 10.1080/01635581.2015.965336 [doi]
AB  - Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) is an important molecule in mediating
      inflammatory colitis, which can lead to colorectal cancer (CRC). The aim of this 
      study was to evaluate the chemopreventive efficacy of apple polysaccharide
      extract (AP) in inhibiting NF-kappaB-mediated inflammation pathways in CRC. We
      evaluated AP in vitro in HT-29 and SW620 human CRC cells. We also used the
      azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulphate (AOM/DSS) model to induce colon
      carcinogenesis in vivo. The chemoprotective effects of AP were assessed using
      Western blot, immunofluorescence assay, real-time PCR, electrophoretic mobility
      shift assay, and flow cytometry. AP reduced AOM/DSS-associated toxicities,
      prevented carcinogenesis, and decreased the expression of TLR4, MD2, MyD88, TRAM,
      TRIF-related adapter molecule, interferon-beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and 
      interleukin-6. The protective effects of AP may be related to the inhibition of
      TLR4/MD2-mediated signaling, including MyD88 and TRIF, as well as the inhibition 
      of NF-kappaB-mediated inflammatory signaling pathways. Therefore, AP could be
      used in combination therapy for the prevention of colitis-associated colon
      cancer.

TI  - Higher vitamin D serum concentration increases health related quality of life in 
      patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 15787-96
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i42.15787 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To investigate the effect of vitamin D (VD) concentrations and VD
      supplementation on health related quality of life in inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) patients. METHODS: A cohort of 220 IBD patients including 141 Crohn's
      disease (CD) and 79 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients was followed-up at a
      tertiary IBD center. A subgroup of the cohort (n = 26) took VD supplements for > 
      3 mo. Health related quality of life was assessed using the short IBD
      questionnaire (sIBDQ). VD serum concentration and sIBDQ score were assessed
      between August and October 2012 (summer/autumn period) and between February and
      April 2013 (winter/spring period). The mean VD serum concentration and its
      correlation with disease activity of CD were determined for each season
      separately. In a subgroup of patients, the effects of VD supplementation on
      winter VD serum concentration, change in VD serum concentration from summer to
      winter, and winter sIBDQ score were analyzed. RESULTS: During the summer/autumn
      and the winter/spring period, 28% and 42% of IBD patients were VD-deficient (< 20
      ng/mL), respectively. In the winter/spring period, there was a significant
      correlation between sIBDQ score and VD serum concentration in UC patients (r =
      0.35, P = 0.02), with a trend towards significance in CD patients (r = 0.17, P = 
      0.06). In the winter/spring period, VD-insufficient patients (< 30 ng/mL) had a
      significantly lower mean sIBDQ score than VD-sufficient patients; this was true
      of both UC (48.3 +/- 2.3 vs 56.7 +/- 3.4, P = 0.04) and CD (55.7 +/- 1.25 vs 60.8
      +/- 2.14, P = 0.04) patients. In all analyzed scenarios (UC/CD, the summer/autumn
      period and the winter/spring period), health related quality of life was the
      highest in patients with VD serum concentrations of 50-59 ng/mL. Supplementation 
      with a median of 800 IU/d VD day did not influence VD serum concentration or the 
      sIBDQ score. CONCLUSION: VD serum concentration correlated with health related
      quality of life in UC and CD patients during the winter/spring period.

AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a leading form of inflammatory bowel disease that
      involves chronic relapsing or progressive inflammation. As a significant
      proportion of UC patients treated with conventional therapies do not achieve
      remission, there is a pressing need for the development of more effective
      therapies. The human gut contains a large, diverse, and dynamic population of
      microorganisms, collectively referred to as the enteric microbiota. There is a
      symbiotic relationship between the human host and the enteric microbiota, which
      provides nutrition, protection against pathogenic organisms, and promotes immune 
      homeostasis. An imbalance of the normal enteric microbiota composition (termed
      dysbiosis) underlies the pathogenesis of UC. A reduction of enteric microbiota
      diversity has been observed in UC patients, mainly affecting the
      butyrate-producing bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, which can
      repress pro-inflammatory cytokines. Many studies have shown that enteric
      microbiota plays an important role in anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory
      activities, which can benefit UC patients. Therefore, manipulation of the
      dysbiosis is an attractive approach for UC therapy. Various therapies targeting a
      restoration of the enteric microbiota have shown efficacy in treating patients
      with active and chronic forms of UC. Such therapies include fecal microbiota
      transplantation, probiotics, prebiotics, antibiotics, helminth therapy, and
      dietary polyphenols, all of which can alter the abundance and composition of the 
      enteric microbiota. Although there have been many large, randomized controlled
      clinical trials assessing these treatments, the effectiveness and safety of these
      bacteria-driven therapies need further evaluation. This review focuses on the
      important role that the enteric microbiota plays in maintaining intestinal
      homeostasis and discusses new therapeutic strategies targeting the enteric
      microbiota for UC.

TI  - Human gut dendritic cells drive aberrant gut-specific t-cell responses in
      ulcerative colitis, characterized by increased IL-4 production and loss of IL-22 
      and IFNgamma.
PG  - 2299-307
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000223 [doi]
AB  - : The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease is incompletely understood but
      results from a dysregulated intestinal immune response to the luminal microbiota.
      CD4 T cells mediate tissue injury in the inflammatory bowel disease-associated
      immune response. Dendritic cells (DC) generate primary T-cell responses and
      mediate intestinal immune tolerance to prevent overt inflammation in response to 
      the gut microbiota. However, most information regarding function of intestinal DC
      has come from mouse models, and information in humans is scarce. We show here
      that intestinal DC subsets are skewed in ulcerative colitis (UC) in humans, with 
      a loss of CD103 lymph-node homing DC; this intestinal DC subset preferentially
      generates regulatory T cells in mice. We show infiltrates of DC negative for
      myeloid marker CD11c, with enhanced expression of Toll-like receptors for
      bacterial recognition. After mixed leukocyte reaction, DC from the inflamed UC
      colon had an enhanced ability to generate gut-specific CD4 T cells with enhanced 
      production of interleukin-4 but a loss of interferon gamma and interleukin-22
      production. Conditioning intestinal DC with probiotic strain Lactobacillus casei 
      Shirota in UC partially restored their normal function indicated by reduced
      Toll-like receptor 2/4 expression and restoration of their ability to imprint
      homing molecules on T cells and to generate interleukin-22 production by
      stimulated T cells. This study suggests that T-cell dysfunction in UC is driven
      by DC. T-cell responses can be manipulated indirectly through effects of
      bacterial conditioning on gut DC with implications for immunomodulatory effects
      of the commensal microbiota in vivo. Manipulation of DC to allow generation of
      DC-specific therapy may be beneficial in inflammatory bowel disease.

PG  - e112154
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0112154 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Dietary factors have been indicated to influence the pathogenesis and 
      nature course of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) with their wide variances. The
      aim of the study was to assess the prevalence and clinical significance of 14
      serum food specific immunoglobulin G (sIgG) antibodies in patients with IBD.
      METHODS: This retrospective study comprised a total of 112 patients with IBD,
      including 79 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 33 with ulcerative colitis (UC).
      Medical records, clinical data and laboratory results were collected for
      analysis. Serum IgG antibodies against 14 unique food allergens were detected by 
      semi-quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Food sIgG
      antibodies were detected in 75.9% (60/79) of CD patients, 63.6% (21/33) of UC
      patients and 33.1% (88/266) of healthy controls (HC). IBD patients showed the
      significantly higher antibodies prevalence than healthy controls (CD vs. HC, P = 
      0.000; UC vs. HC, P = 0.001). However no marked difference was observed between
      CD and UC groups (P = 0.184). More subjects were found with sensitivity to
      multiple antigens (>/= 3) in IBD than in HC group (33.9% vs.0.8%, P = 0.000). Egg
      was the most prevalent food allergen. There was a remarkable difference in the
      levels of general serum IgM (P = 0.045) and IgG (P = 0.041) between patients with
      positive and negative sIgG antibodies. Patients with multiple positive allergens 
      (>/= 3) were especially found with significant higher total IgG levels compared
      with sIgG-negative patients (P = 0.003). Age was suggested as a protective factor
      against the occurrence of sIgG antibodies (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The study
      demonstrates a high prevalence of serum IgG antibodies to specific food allergens
      in patients with IBD. sIgG antibodies may potentially indicate disease status in 
      clinical and be utilized to guide diets for patients.

AB  - In this paper a review of the researches on the role of Escherichia coli strain
      Nissle 1917 (EcN) in gastrointestinal diseases was presented. EcN is a
      non-pathogenic strain of the Enterobacteriaceae family, which has probiotic
      properties. In a number of studies conducted among humans and experimental
      animals the application of EcN in treatment of gastrointestinal diseases was
      observed. Most studies about EcN has been devoted to this organism efficacy in
      ulcerative colitis treatment. Comparable results were obtained, by citied
      authors, in the treatment (sustaining remission) of EcN and mesalazine in
      ulcerative colitis. Moreover, this probiotic therapy, compared to placebo,
      contributes to obtaining a faster remission and improvement of intestinal
      histopathology. The use of EcN in Crohn's disease has not been the subject of as 
      many studies as in the case of ulcerative colitis. Assessing the importance of
      EcN in treatment of other gastrointestinal disorders, authors of the studies
      observed, that in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, who receiving this
      probiotic there was a pain, nausea and bloating reduction. In studies conducted
      among children a positive impact of EcN in prevention and treatment of diarrhea
      was demonstrated. Similar results were obtained in studies conducted in
      experimental animals. Based on the presented review it can be concluded that the 
      strain of Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 is useful in treatment of gastrointestinal
      diseases, especially in treatment of ulcerative colitis. This probiotic may
      constitute a part of treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and diarrhea. The
      effectiveness of this strain in treatment of Crohn's disease is not clearly
      established and further research are require.

TI  - Managing osteoporosis in ulcerative colitis: something new?
PG  - 14087-98
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i39.14087 [doi]
AB  - The authors revise the latest evidence in the literature regarding managing of
      osteoporosis in ulcerative colitis (UC), paying particular attention to the
      latest tendency of the research concerning the management of bone damage in the
      patient affected by UC. It is wise to assess vitamin D status in ulcerative
      colitis patients to recognize who is predisposed to low levels of vitamin D,
      whose deficiency has to be treated with oral or parenteral vitamin D
      supplementation. An adequate dietary calcium intake or supplementation and
      physical activity, if possible, should be guaranteed. Osteoporotic risk factors, 
      such as smoking and excessive alcohol intake, must be avoided. Steroid has to be 
      prescribed at the lowest possible dosage and for the shortest possible time.
      Moreover, conditions favoring falling have to been minimized, like carpets, low
      illumination, sedatives assumption, vitamin D deficiency. It is advisable to
      assess the fracture risk in all UC patient by the fracture assessment risk tool
      (FRAX((R)) tool), that calculates the ten years risk of fracture for the
      population aged from 40 to 90 years in many countries of the world. A high risk
      value could indicate the necessity of treatment, whereas a low risk value
      suggests a follow-up only. An intermediate risk supports the decision to
      prescribe bone mineral density (BMD) assessment and a subsequent patient
      revaluation for treatment. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry bone densitometry can
      be used not only for BMD measurement, but also to collect data about bone quality
      by the means of trabecular bone score and hip structural analysis assessment.
      These two indices could represent a method of interesting perspectives in
      evaluating bone status in patients affected by diseases like UC, which may
      present an impairment of bone quality as well as of bone quantity. In literature 
      there is no strong evidence for instituting pharmacological therapy of bone
      impairment in UC patients for clinical indications other than those that are also
      applied to the patients with osteoporosis. Therefore, a reasonable advice is to
      consider pharmacological treatment for osteoporosis in those UC patients who
      already present fragility fractures, which bring a high risk of subsequent
      fractures. Therapy has also to be considered in patients with a high risk of
      fracture even if it did not yet happen, and particularly when they had long
      periods of corticosteroid therapy or cumulative high dosages. In patients without
      fragility fractures or steroid treatment, a medical decision about treatment
      could be guided by the FRAX tool to determine the intervention threshold. Among
      drugs for osteoporosis treatment, the bisphosphonates are the most studied ones, 
      with the best and longest evidence of efficacy and safety. Despite this, several 
      questions are still open, such as the duration of treatment, the necessity to
      discontinue it, the indication of therapy in young patients, particularly in
      those without previous fractures. Further, it has to be mentioned that a
      long-term bisphosphonates use in primary osteoporosis has been associated with an
      increased incidence of dramatic side-effects, even if uncommon, like
      osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical sub-trochanteric and diaphyseal femoral
      fractures. UC is a long-lasting disease and the majority of patients is
      relatively young. In this scenario primary prevention of fragility fracture is
      the best cost-effective strategy. Vitamin D supplementation, adequate calcium
      intake, suitable physical activity (when possible), removing of risk factors for 
      osteoporosis like smoking, and avoiding falling are the best medical acts.

TI  - Polyphenolic extracts from cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) protect colonic
      myofibroblasts (CCD18Co cells) from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced
      inflammation--modulation of microRNA 126.
PG  - 146-54
LID - 10.1039/c4fo00459k [doi]
AB  - Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) is a drought tolerant crop with several agronomic
      advantages over other legumes. This study evaluated varieties from four major
      cowpea phenotypes (black, red, light brown and white) containing different
      phenolic profiles for their anti-inflammatory property on non-malignant colonic
      myofibroblasts (CCD18Co) cells challenged with an endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, 
      LPS). Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay on the LPS-stimulated
      cells revealed antioxidative potential of black and red cowpea varieties.
      Real-time qRT-PCR analysis in LPS-stimulated cells revealed down-regulation of
      proinflammatory cytokines (IL-8, TNF-alpha, VCAM-1), transcription factor
      NF-kappaB and modulation of microRNA-126 (specific post-transcriptional regulator
      of VCAM-1) by cowpea polyphenolics. The ability of cowpea polyphenols to modulate
      miR-126 signaling and its target gene VCAM-1 were studied in LPS-stimulated
      endothelial cells transfected with a specific inhibitor of miR-126, and treated
      with 10 mg GAE/L black cowpea extract where the extract in part reversed the
      effect of the miR-126 inhibitor. This suggests that cowpea may exert their
      anti-inflammatory activities at least in part through induction of miR-126 that
      then down-regulate VCAM-1 mRNA and protein expressions. Overall, Cowpea therefore
      is promising as an anti-inflammatory dietary component.

TI  - Recombinant Clostridium difficile toxin B induces endoplasmic reticulum stress in
      mouse colonal carcinoma cells.
PG  - 973-81
LID - 10.1093/abbs/gmu091 [doi]
AB  - Clostridium difficile is the main cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and
      pseudomembranous colitis in humans and animals. Its pathogenicity is primarily
      linked to the secretion of two exotoxins (TcdA and TcdB). Although great progress
      in the toxic mechanism of TcdA and TcdB has been achieved, there are many
      conflicting reports about the apoptotic mechanism. More importantly, apoptotic
      endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been reported in cells treated with Shiga
      toxins-another kind of cytotoxins that can cause diarrhea and colitis. Herein we 
      checked whether TcdB can induce ER stress. The results showed that recombinant
      TcdB (rTcdB) activated molecular markers of unfolded protein response, suggesting
      that rTcdB induced ER stress in CT26 cells. However, rTcdB did not induce the
      up-regulation of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), a classic mediator of apoptotic
      ER stress, but it activated the precursor of cysteine aspartic acid-specific
      protease 12 (caspase-12), a controversial mediator of apoptotic ER stress.
      Besides, glucosyltransferase activity-deficient mutant recombinant TcdB induced
      ER stress, though it has no cytotoxic or cytopathic effect on CT26 cells.
      Altogether, these data demonstrated that ER stress induced by rTcdB is
      glucosyltransferase-independent, indicating that ER stress induced by rTcdB is
      non-apoptotic. This work also offers us a new insight into the molecular
      mechanism of CHOP protein expression regulation and the role of CHOP expression
      in ER stress.

TI  - Lactobacillus helveticus SBT2171 inhibits lymphocyte proliferation by regulation 
      of the JNK signaling pathway.
PG  - e108360
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0108360 [doi]
AB  - Lactobacillus helveticus SBT2171 (LH2171) is a lactic acid bacterium with high
      protease activity and used in starter cultures in the manufacture of cheese. We
      recently reported that consumption of cheese manufactured using LH2171 alleviated
      symptoms of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. In this study, 
      we have examined whether LH2171 itself exerts an inhibitory effect on the
      excessive proliferation of lymphocytes. We found that LH2171 inhibited the
      proliferation of LPS-stimulated mouse T and B cells, and the human lymphoma cell 
      lines, Jurkat and BJAB. Cell cycle analysis showed an accumulation of
      LH2171-treated BJAB cells in the G2/M phase. Further, phosphorylation of c-Jun
      N-terminal kinase (JNK) and c-Jun was reduced by LH2171 in BJAB cells.
      Subsequently, expression of cell division cycle 2 (CDC2), regulated by the JNK
      signaling pathway and essential for G2/M phase progression, was inhibited by
      LH2171. It was also demonstrated that intraperitoneal administration of LH2171
      strongly alleviated symptoms of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice. These
      findings suggest that LH2171 inhibits the proliferation of lymphocytes through a 
      suppression of the JNK signaling pathway and exerts an immunosuppressive effect
      in vivo.

AB  - Whole-grain foods such as oats may protect against colorectal cancer and have
      benefits on inflammatory bowel disease and coeliac disease. The present study
      aimed to systematically review the literature describing intervention studies
      that investigated the effects of oats or oat bran on risk factors for bowel
      disease. A literature search was conducted using Embase, Medline and the Cochrane
      library, which identified 654 potential articles. Thirty-eight articles
      describing twenty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Two studies carried
      out in participants with a history of colorectal adenomas found no effects of
      increased oat-bran intake on indirect risk makers for colorectal cancer. One of
      two interventions with oat bran in patients with ulcerative colitis showed small 
      improvements in the patients' conditions. Most of the eleven studies carried out 
      in adults with coeliac disease showed no negative effects of uncontaminated oat
      consumption. The fourteen studies carried out in volunteers with no history of
      bowel disease suggest that oats or oat bran can significantly increase stool
      weight and decrease constipation, but there is a lack of evidence to support a
      specific effect of oats on bowel function compared with other cereals. A
      long-term dietary intake of oats or oat bran could benefit inflammatory bowel
      disorders, but this remains to be proven. A protective effect on colorectal
      adenoma and cancer incidence has not yet been convincingly shown. The majority of
      patients with coeliac disease could consume up to 100 g/d of uncontaminated oats,
      which would increase the acceptability of, and adherence to, a gluten-free diet.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diet may have a role in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease.
      In previous studies, the associations between increased intakes of carbohydrates,
      sugar, starch, and inflammatory bowel disease are inconsistent. However, few
      prospective studies have investigated the associations between these
      macronutrients and incident Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC).
      METHODS: A total of 401,326 men and women were recruited between 1991 and 1998.
      At recruitment, dietary intakes of carbohydrate, sugar, and starch were measured 
      using validated food frequency questionnaires. The cohort was monitored
      identifying participants who developed incident CD or UC. Cases were matched with
      4 controls, and odds ratios were calculated for quintiles of total carbohydrate, 
      sugar, and starch intakes adjusted for total energy intake, body mass index, and 
      smoking. RESULTS: One hundred ten participants developed CD, and 244 participants
      developed UC during follow-up. The adjusted odds ratio for the highest versus the
      lowest quintiles of total carbohydrate intake for CD was 0.87, 95% CI = 0.24 to
      3.12 and for UC 1.46, 95% CI = 0.62 to 3.46, with no significant trends across
      quintiles for either (CD, P trend = 0.70; UC, P trend = 0.41). Similarly, no
      associations were observed with intakes of total sugar (CD, P trend = 0.50; UC, P
      trend = 0.71) or starch (CD, P trend = 0.69; UC, P trend = 0.17). CONCLUSIONS:
      The lack of associations with these nutrients is in agreement with many
      case-control studies that have not identified associations with CD or UC. As
      there is biological plausibility for how specific carbohydrates could have an
      etiological role in inflammatory bowel disease, future epidemiological work
      should assess individual carbohydrates, although there does not seem to be a
      macronutrient effect.

      against Clostridium difficile toxin.
PG  - 570-5; discussion 576
LID - 10.1097/TA.0000000000000378 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence and severity of Clostridium difficile colitis have
      increased dramatically in the last decade. Disease severity is related to C.
      difficile virulence factors, including toxins A and B, as well as the patient's
      immune status. The intestinal mucus is an important component of innate barrier
      function in the intestine. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is a key constituent of the
      intestinal mucus barrier, and exogenous PC administration has had therapeutic
      efficacy in patients with ulcerative colitis. We studied the protective function 
      of exogenous PC on C. difficile toxin effects on the intestinal barrier in vitro.
      METHODS: Mucus-producing (HT29-MTX strain) and non-mucus-producing (HT29 strain) 
      intestinal epithelial monolayers were cocultured with PC and C. difficile toxin A
      added to the apical media. Basal chamber culture supernatants were subsequently
      obtained, and tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 6 were quantitated by
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In other experiments, HT29 toxin A uptake,
      intestinal monolayer permeability, necrosis, and actin microfilament disruption
      were determined. RESULTS: There was a threefold to fourfold decrease in tumor
      necrosis factor and interleukin 6 levels and similar decreases in toxin A uptake 
      and permeability changes in intestinal epithelial cells with mucus or PC versus
      control. Intestinal epithelial cell necrosis was reduced by more than 50% with
      either mucus or PC versus control. The integrity of HT29 cell cytoskeleton was
      demonstrated by both the mucus layer of the HT29-MTX strain and by exogenous PC
      administration by phalloidin staining of actin microfilaments. CONCLUSION: PC
      supplementation was effective in improving intestinal barrier defense against C. 
      difficile toxin A challenge. PC administration may be a useful therapeutic
      adjunct in severe cases of C. difficile colitis or in patients who do not improve
      with conventional treatment.

      cross-sectional study.
PG  - 1628-35

AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease that causes
      gastrointestinal lesions, bleeding, diarrhoea and nutritional complications.
      Insufficient nutrient intake can additionally deteriorate nutritional status. The
      present cross-sectional study aimed to determine whether UC patients adhere to
      national dietary guidelines and to assess their dietary habits. An online
      questionnaire (n 93) was used to assess health-related conditions, current
      nutritional knowledge, professional dietary guidance and food avoidance. A 24 h
      dietary recall (n 81) was used to assess nutrient intakes, which were then
      compared with the national recommended intake values. The results showed that the
      nutritional knowledge of participants was limited with unofficial sources being
      used, including websites. Numerous food groups, predominantly fibre-rich foods
      and fruit and vegetables, were largely avoided by the participants. Almost half
      of the study population eliminated foods such as dairy products to alleviate
      symptoms, possibly unnecessarily. Energy intakes were significantly (P< 0.05)
      lower than the national recommended intake values in women aged 18-65 years and
      men aged 18-60 years. Fat intake exceeded the national recommended intake values 
      (P< 0.0001), at the expense of carbohydrate and fibre intakes, which were
      significantly (P< 0.005) lower than the national recommended intake values.
      Protein intake was significantly high in women aged 19-50 years (P< 0.00) and men
      aged 19-50 years (P< 0.005). Vitamin C, vitamin B12 and Ca intake levels were
      overachieved by all participants (P< 0.001), while women aged 19-50 years did not
      achieve their dietary Fe reference nutrient intake levels (P< 0.001).
      Osteopaenia, osteoporosis and anaemia were reported by 12, 6 and 31 % of the
      participants, respectively. Findings indicate that food avoidance may contribute 
      to nutrient deficiencies in UC patients. Low intakes of these food groups,
      especially during remission, are preventing patients from adhering to dietary
      guidelines.

TI  - The use of probiotics in IBD and IBS.
PG  - 491-500
AB  - While the role of microflora is well established in the development of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBS); data is still emerging regarding IBS as the
      knowledge on brain-gut interaction grows. For both patient groups multiple
      efficacious treatments exist, but there are still unmet needs as long term
      disease control remains an issue. Given the importance of the microbiome on the
      development of the immune system and the interaction between the microbiome and
      the host organism, this "route" is being examined increasingly as a therapeutic
      possibility in both pathologies with variable results. We here provide a short
      overview on the existing data, meta-analysis and single studies, on probiotic
      treatment in both diseases.

TI  - Antibiotics, probiotics and prebiotics in IBD.
PG  - 83-100
LID - 10.1159/000360713 [doi]
AB  - The dysbiosis theory of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) posits that there is an 
      alteration in the gut microbiome as an important underpinning of disease
      etiology. It stands to reason then, that administering agents that could impact
      on the balance of microbes on the gut could be impactful on the course of IBD.
      Herein is a review of the controlled trials undertaken to assess the use of
      antibiotics that would kill or suppress potentially injurious microbes,
      probiotics that would overpopulate the gut with potentially beneficial microbes
      or prebiotics that provide a metabolic substrate that enhances the growth of
      potentially beneficial microbes. With regard to antibiotics, the best data are
      for the use of nitroimadoles postoperatively in Crohn's disease (CD) to prevent
      disease recurrence. Otherwise, the data are limited with the regard to any
      lasting benefit of antibiotics sustaining remission in either CD or ulcerative
      colitis (UC). A recent meta-analysis concluded that antibiotics are superior to
      placebo at inducing remission in CD or UC, although the meta-analysis grouped a
      variety of antibiotics with different spectra of activity. Despite the absence of
      robust clinical trial data, antibiotics are widely used to treat perineal
      fistulizing CD and acute and chronic pouchitis. Probiotics have not been shown to
      have a beneficial role in CD. However, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 has
      comparable effects to low doses of mesalamine in maintaining remission in UC.
      VSL#3, a combination of 8 microbes, has been shown to have an effect in inducing 
      remission in UC and preventing pouchitis. Prebiotics have yet to be shown to have
      an effect in any form of IBD, but to date controlled trials have been small. The 
      use of antibiotics should be balanced against the risks they pose. Even
      probiotics may pose some risk and should not be assumed to be innocuous
      especially when ingested by persons with a compromised epithelial barrier.
      Prebiotics may not be harmful but may cause gastrointestinal side effects.
      Finally, the timing of ingestion of antibiotics and other dietary factors that
      may function as prebiotics, especially in early childhood, may be critical in
      shaping the gut microbiome and ultimately predisposing to or preventing IBD.
      Finding ways to impact on the gut microbiome to alter the course of IBD makes
      good sense, but should be undertaken in the setting of rigorously performed
      controlled trials to ensure that the interventions are truly effective and well
      tolerated.

AB  - Abundant clinical and experimental evidence supports a role for resident
      microbiota in Crohn's disease and pouchitis, and probably in ulcerative colitis
      (UC). These disorders occur in areas of highest bacterial concentrations.
      Pouchitis and Crohn's colitis respond to antibiotics, while pouchitis and UC can 
      be treated with probiotics. Serologic markers recognizing intestinal bacteria and
      yeast are present in the majority of Crohn's disease patients and may predict
      disease aggressiveness. Abnormal profiles of fecal and mucosally associated
      enteric bacteria (dysbiosis) occur in Crohn's disease, UC, pouchitis and
      experimental enterocolitis, with a proliferation of aggressive species that
      promote experimental colitis and a corresponding decrease in protective bacterial
      subsets. Many of these protective bacteria produce short-chain fatty acids,
      including butyrate, that promote epithelial barrier function, inhibit effector
      immune responses and induce regulatory T cell subsets. Furthermore, certain
      Clostridia species stimulate regulatory T cells that can inhibit intestinal
      inflammation. Animal models of chronic, immune-mediated enterocolitis
      convincingly demonstrate that enteric resident bacteria stimulate effector immune
      cells in susceptible hosts and that a subset of enteric bacteria has particularly
      aggressive activities, with host and bacterial specificity. Recent studies
      suggest parallel and perhaps complementary roles for enteric viruses, which have 
      only very recently been identified.

AB  - Increased understanding of the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs)
      has led to new therapeutic strategies. One of these is to target the molecules
      that regulate interactions between leukocytes and endothelial cells at sites of
      inflammation (mainly leukocyte integrins and endothelial cell adhesion molecules 
      of the immunoglobulin superfamily). These molecules have been validated as
      therapeutic targets for IBD; several have shown efficacy, and 2 have been
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of IBD. Natalizumab,
      the first anti-integrin antibody tested for treatment of IBD, blocks the alpha4
      subunit. Although it is effective, its clinical use has been limited by its
      association with risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Other,
      allegedly more selective drugs that affect leukocyte recruitment in the
      gastrointestinal tract have been developed or are under investigation and could
      increase safety. These include vedolizumab and AMG 181 (antibodies against
      alpha4beta7), etrolizumab (anti-beta7), and PF-00547659 (anti-mucosal vascular
      addressin cell adhesion molecule 1). Other agents have been developed to block
      alpha4 (the small molecule AJM300), CCR9 (the small molecule CCX282-B), and
      CXCL10 (the antibody eldelumab). We review the scientific rationale for
      inhibiting interactions between leukocytes and endothelial cells to reduce
      intestinal inflammation and analyze the clinical studies that have been performed
      to test these new molecules, with particular attention to safety. We propose an
      evidence-based clinical positioning of this class of drugs.

TI  - Distinct patterns of IgG and IgA against food and microbial antigens in serum and
      feces of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - e106750
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0106750 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with a defective
      intestinal barrier and enhanced adaptive immune responses against commensal
      microbiota. Immune responses against food antigens in IBD patients remain poorly 
      defined. METHODS: IgG and IgA specific for food and microfloral antigens (wheat
      and milk extracts; purified ovalbumin; Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis 
      lysates; mannan from Saccharomyces cerevisiae) were analyzed by ELISA in the
      serum and feces of patients with Crohn's disease (CD; n = 52 for serum and n = 20
      for feces), ulcerative colitis (UC; n = 29; n = 17), acute
      gastroenteritis/colitis (AGE; n = 12; n = 9) as well as non-inflammatory controls
      (n = 61; n = 39). RESULTS: Serum anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) 
      and anti-B. fragilis IgG and IgA levels were increased in CD patients whereas
      antibody (Ab) levels against E. coli and food antigens were not significantly
      different within the patient groups and controls. Subgroup analysis revealed that
      CD patients with severe diseases defined by stricturing and penetrating lesions
      have slightly higher anti-food and anti-microbial IgA levels whereas CD and UC
      patients with arthropathy have decreased anti-food IgG levels. Treatment with
      anti-TNF-alpha Abs in CD patients was associated with significantly decreased
      ASCA IgG and IgA and anti-E. coli IgG. In the feces specific IgG levels against
      all antigens were higher in CD and AGE patients while specific IgA levels were
      higher in non-IBD patients. Anti-food IgG and IgA levels did not correlate with
      food intolerance. SUMMARY: In contrast to anti-microbial Abs, we found only minor
      changes in serum anti-food Ab levels in specific subgroups of IBD patients. Fecal
      Ab levels towards microbial and food antigens show distinct patterns in controls,
      CD and UC patients.

TI  - Intestinal microbiota, probiotics and prebiotics in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 11505-24
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i33.11505 [doi]
AB  - It has been presumed that aberrant immune response to intestinal microorganisms
      in genetically predisposed individuals may play a major role in the pathogenesis 
      of the inflammatory bowel disease, and there is a good deal of evidence
      supporting this hypothesis. Commensal enteric bacteria probably play a central
      role in pathogenesis, providing continuous antigenic stimulation that causes
      chronic intestinal injury. A strong biologic rationale supports the use of
      probiotics and prebiotics for inflammatory bowel disease therapy. Many probiotic 
      strains exhibit anti-inflammatory properties through their effects on different
      immune cells, pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion depression, and the induction
      of anti-inflammatory cytokines. There is very strong evidence supporting the use 
      of multispecies probiotic VSL#3 for the prevention or recurrence of postoperative
      pouchitis in patients. For treatment of active ulcerative colitis, as well as for
      maintenance therapy, the clinical evidence of efficacy is strongest for VSL#3 and
      Escherichia coli Nissle 1917. Moreover, some prebiotics, such as germinated
      barley foodstuff, Psyllium or oligofructose-enriched inulin, might provide some
      benefit in patients with active ulcerative colitis or ulcerative colitis in
      remission. The results of clinical trials in the treatment of active Crohn's
      disease or the maintenance of its remission with probiotics and prebiotics are
      disappointing and do not support their use in this disease. The only exception is
      weak evidence of advantageous use of Saccharomyces boulardii concomitantly with
      medical therapy in maintenance treatment.

TI  - Carnosic acid suppresses colon tumor formation in association with antiadipogenic
      activity.
PG  - 2274-85
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201400293 [doi]
AB  - SCOPE: This study determined the efficacy of carnosic acid (CA) for suppressing
      colon carcinogenesis associated with excess adiposity. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cell 
      growth regulation by CA was evaluated in HT-29 colon adenocarcinoma cells
      cocultured with 3T3-L1 adipocytes. To determine the in vivo efficacies, male A/J 
      mice were divided into four groups and fed one of the following experimental
      diets for 11 wk: 15% fat, 45% fat, 45% fat + 0.01% CA, or 45% fat + 0.02% CA.
      Azoxymethane was administered at the beginning of experimental diet and two
      cycles of dextran sodium sulfate were supplied 1 wk after the azoxymethane
      injection. The proliferation of HT-29 cells cocultured with 3T3-L1 cells was
      significantly higher than proliferation of control cells (p < 0.05). CA treatment
      suppressed the growth of cocultured HT-29 cells through cell cycle arrest and
      enhanced apoptosis by inhibiting leptin receptor (Ob-R) signaling, including Akt 
      and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. CA
      supplementation in vivo decreased the number of colon tumors and reduced
      circulating concentrations of leptin, adiponectin, insulin, and insulin-like
      growth factor 1. Colonic expression of Ob-R, insulin receptor (IR), p-Akt, p-ERK,
      B-cell lymphoma extra large (Bcl-xL), and cyclinD1 protein was also suppressed in
      animals fed CA. CONCLUSION: CA appears to alleviate adipocity-related
      acceleration of colon tumor formation.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and relapsing inflammatory disorder
      of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and currently no curative treatment is
      available. Mangiferin, a natural glucosylxanthone mainly from the fruit, leaves
      and stem bark of a mango tree, has a strong anti-inflammatory activity. We sought
      to investigate whether mangiferin attenuates inflammation in a mouse model of
      chemically induced IBD. Pre-administration of mangiferin significantly attenuated
      dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced body weight loss, diarrhea, colon shortening
      and histological injury, which correlated with the decline in the activity of
      myeloperoxidase (MPO) and the level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in
      the colon. DSS-induced degradation of inhibitory kappaBalpha (IkappaBalpha) and
      the phosphorylation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) p65 as well as the mRNA
      expression of pro-inflammatory mediators (inducible NO synthase (iNOS),
      intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), TNF-alpha, interleukin-1beta
      (IL-1beta) and IL-6) in the colon were also downregulated by mangiferin
      treatment. Additionally, the phosphorylation/activation of DSS-induced
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) proteins was also inhibited by mangiferin
      treatment. In accordance with the in vivo results, mangiferin exposure blocked
      TNF-alpha-stimulated nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB in RAW264.7 mouse
      macrophage cells. Transient transfection gene reporter assay performed in
      TNF-alpha-stimulated HT-29 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells indicated that
      mangiferin inhibits NF-kappaB transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent
      manner. The current study clearly demonstrates a protective role for mangiferin
      in experimental IBD through NF-kappaB and MAPK signaling inhibition. Since
      mangiferin is a natural compound with little toxicity, the results may contribute
      to the effective utilization of mangiferin in the treatment of human IBD.

AB  - Chlorogenic acid (CHA) is an antioxidant polyphenol prevalent in human diet, with
      coffee, fruits, and vegetables being its main source. Effects of CHA and CHA
      metabolites were evaluated on the IL-8 production in human intestinal Caco-2
      cells induced by combined stimulation with tumour necrosis factor alpha
      (TNFalpha) and H2O2. CHA and caffeic acid (CA) inhibited TNFalpha- and
      H2O2-induced IL-8 production. We also examined the in vivo effects of CHA and CA 
      using dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. CHA attenuated
      DSS-induced body weight loss, diarrhea, fecal blood, and shortening of colon and 
      dramatically improved colitis histological scores. Furthermore, increases in the 
      mRNA expression of colonic macrophage inflammatory protein 2 and IL-1beta, which 
      were induced by DSS, were significantly suppressed by CHA supplementation. These 
      results suggest that dietary CHA use may aid in the prevention of intestinal
      inflammatory conditions.

TI  - Non-pulmonary allergic diseases and inflammatory bowel disease: a qualitative
      review.
PG  - 11023-32
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i32.11023 [doi]
AB  - While the etiological underpinnings of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are
      highly complex, it has been noted that both clinical and pathophysiological
      similarities exist between IBD and both asthma and non-pulmonary allergic
      phenomena. In this review, several key points on common biomarkers,
      pathophysiology, clinical manifestations and nutritional and probiotic
      interventions for both IBD and non-pulmonary allergic diseases are discussed.
      Histamine and mast cell activity show common behaviors in both IBD and in certain
      allergic disorders. IgE also represents a key immunoglobulin involved in both IBD
      and in certain allergic pathologies, though these links require further study.
      Probiotics remain a critically important intervention for both IBD subtypes as
      well as multiple allergic phenomena. Linked clinical phenomena, especially
      sinonasal disease and IBD, are discussed. In addition, nutritional interventions 
      remain an underutilized and promising therapy for modification of both allergic
      disorders and IBD. Recommending new mothers breastfeed their infants, and
      increasing the duration of breastfeeding may also help prevent both IBD and
      allergic diseases, but requires more investigation. While much remains to be
      discovered, it is clear that non-pulmonary allergic phenomena are connected to
      IBD in a myriad number of ways and that the discovery of common immunological
      pathways may usher in an era of vastly improved treatments for patients.

TI  - PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales and Gastrointestinal Worry Scales in
      pediatric patients with functional and organic gastrointestinal diseases in
      comparison to healthy controls.
PG  - 363-78
LID - 10.1007/s11136-014-0781-x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to compare the gastrointestinal (GI)
      symptoms and worry of pediatric patients with functional GI disorders (FGIDs) and
      organic GI diseases to healthy controls utilizing the Pediatric Quality of Life
      Inventory (PedsQL) Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales for patient
      self-reports ages 5-18 years and parent proxy-reports for ages 2-18 years. The
      secondary objective was to compare FGIDs and organic GI diseases to each other.
      METHODS: The PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales were completed in 
      a 9-site study by 587 pediatric patients with GI disorders and 685 parents of
      patients. Patients had physician-diagnosed GI disorders (chronic constipation,
      functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia,
      Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease). Ten
      Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales measuring Stomach Pain, Stomach Discomfort When 
      Eating, Food and Drink Limits, Trouble Swallowing, Heartburn and Reflux, Nausea
      and Vomiting, Gas and Bloating, Constipation, Blood, and Diarrhea were
      administered along with two Gastrointestinal Worry Scales. Five hundred and
      thirteen healthy children and 337 parents of healthy children completed the
      PedsQL Gastrointestinal Scales in an Internet panel survey. RESULTS: The PedsQL
      Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales distinguished between pediatric
      patients with FGIDs and organic GI diseases in comparison with healthy controls, 
      supporting known-groups validity. Patients with FGIDs reported more GI symptoms
      and worry than patients with organic GI diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The PedsQL
      Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales may be utilized as common metrics
      across pediatric patient groups with FGIDs and organic GI diseases and healthy
      samples to measure GI-specific symptoms in clinical research and practice.

AB  - A 2011 outbreak of hemorrhagic colitis, which resulted in the death of two
      individuals, was associated with contaminated strawberries. A study was conducted
      to identify antimicrobial washes effective at reducing E. coli O157:H7 and
      Salmonella enterica from the surface of fresh whole strawberries during
      two-minute immersion washes. Twenty-seven antimicrobial treatments were tested.
      Vacuum perfusion was applied to strawberries during chlorine and peracetic acid
      treatments to promote infiltration of sanitizer into porous strawberry tissue.
      Strawberries were inoculated to 7.1logCFU/strawberry with a seven-strain
      bacterial composite, consisting of three strains of E. coli O157:H7 and four
      serovars of Salmonella enterica. Berries were air-dried for 2h and immersed in
      circulating antimicrobial solutions for 120s at 22 degrees C. Four treatments
      reduced >/=3.0logCFU/strawberry, including (a) 1% acetic acid+1% H2O2, (b) 30%
      ethanol+1% H2O2, (c) 90ppm peracetic acid, and (d) 1% lactic acid+1% H2O2. Two
      additional treatments that reduced 2.8logCFU/strawberry were (a) 40% ethanol, and
      (b) 1% each of phosphoric+fumaric acids. Eight treatments reduced
      2.0-2.6logCFU/strawberry. Five treatments reduced <1.45CFU/strawberry, including 
      (a) 1% citric acid, (b) 1% lactic acid, (c) 1% acetic acid, (d) 0.5% each of
      acetic+citric acids and (e) 0.5% each of acetic+lactic acids. The use of vacuum
      perfusion with 200ppm chlorine or 90ppm peracetic acid did not reduce greater
      populations of pathogens than did the same treatments without vacuum perfusion.
      Fourteen treatments reduced no more pathogens (p<0.05) than did sterile deionized
      water. Results from this study provide some options for end-point decontamination
      of strawberries for retail operations just prior to serving to customers.

TI  - Short-chain fructo-oligosaccharide and inulin modulate inflammatory responses and
      microbial communities in Caco2-bbe cells and in a mouse model of intestinal
      injury.
PG  - 1725-33
LID - 10.3945/jn.114.195081 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have focused on the ability of prebiotics to prevent
      pathogen-induced cellular changes or alter the composition of the intestinal
      microbiota in complimentary relevant cell and animal models of inflammatory bowel
      disease. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine if pretreatment 
      with inulin and a short-chain fructo-oligosaccharide (sc-FOS) prevents
      enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 infection in Caco2-bbe
      epithelial cells and what effect 10% wt:v sc-FOS or inulin has on C57BL/6 mice
      under sham conditions or pretreatment with prebiotics before Citrobacter
      rodentium infection (10(8) colony-forming units). METHODS: Actin rearrangement
      and tight junction protein (zona occludin-1) were examined with
      immunofluorescence. Barrier function was assessed by a fluorescent probe and by
      measuring transepithelial electrical resistance (TER). Alterations in cytokine
      gene expression and microbiome were assessed with quantitative reverse
      transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridization.
      Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were measured by GC. RESULTS: sc-FOS added to
      monolayers altered actin polymerization without affecting TER or permeability to 
      a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) probe, whereas inulin increased TER (P <
      0.005) and altered actin arrangement without affecting FITC permeability. Neither
      prebiotic attenuated EHEC-induced decreases in barrier function. Prebiotics
      increased interleukin 10 (Il10) and transforming growth factor-beta (Tgfbeta)
      cytokine responses alone (P < 0.05) or with EHEC O157:H7 infection (P < 0.05) in 
      vitro. Increases in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (Tnfalpha) (P < 0.05) and
      decreases in chemokine CXC motif ligand 8 (Cxcl8) (P < 0.05) expression were
      observed with prebiotic treatment prior to EHEC infection. No differences were
      noted in barrier function or cytokine responses in the absence or presence of C. 
      rodentium in vivo. Alterations in microbiome were evident at 6 d and 10 d
      postinfection in treatment groups, but a change in C. rodentium load was not
      observed. Inulin and sc-FOS (P < 0.05) increased fecal SCFAs in the absence of
      infection. CONCLUSION: This study provides new insights as to how prebiotics act 
      in complementary in vitro and in vivo models of intestinal injury.

TI  - Homocysteine in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 189-92
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hyperhomocysteinemia seems to be a common phenomenon in both patients
      with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Many factors including deficiencies 
      of cobalamin, folate and pyridoxine, smoking habits, alcohol and coffee intake,
      some medications and age may predispose subjects to hyperhomocysteinemia. The
      study aimed to evaluate homocysteine levels in an inflammatory bowel disease
      cohort as dependent of life style and disease activity. METHODS: 85 consecutive
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease (38 with Crohn's disease and 47 with
      ulcerative colitis) and 65 control subjects were included in the prospective
      study. The following parameters were analyzed: disease activity, duration of the 
      disease, location of pathological changes, presence of complications, current
      medications, past surgical procedures, smoking history, concomitant diseases,
      biochemical parameters and plasma homocysteine levels. RESULTS: Mild
      hyperhomocysteinemia was found in 16 patients with Crohn's disease (42%), 19
      patients with ulcerative colitis (40%) and 19 patients in the control group (29%)
      (p = 0.59). There was not any significant correlation between homocysteine level 
      and disease activity. Only folic acid supplementation and gender affected
      homocysteine level. Folic acid intake led to reduction of homocysteine levels in 
      all groups of patients (11.8 micromol/l vs. 8.33 miccromol/l, p = 0.0065 in
      Crohn's disease patients and 10.94 micromol/l vs. 7.78 micromol/l, p = 0.0069 in 
      ulcerative colitis patients). CONCLUSION: Homocysteine level in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease is mostly normal or slightly elevated. Disease
      activity does not have an impact on homocysteine level. Folic acid is the most
      important factor having an influence on homocysteine level in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Gut microbiota and inflammatory bowel disease: the role of antibiotics in disease
      management.
PG  - 7-19
LID - 10.3810/pgm.2014.07.2779 [doi]
AB  - Imbalances in the composition and number of bacteria in the gut microbiota have
      been implicated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and modulation of the gut
      microbiota by probiotics and antibiotics in IBD has been an active area of
      research, with mixed results. This narrative review summarizes the findings of
      relevant publications identified using the PubMed database. Although antibiotics 
      have been associated with an increased risk of IBD development and flares,
      several meta-analyses demonstrate that antibiotics are efficacious for the
      induction of remission and treatment of flares in patients with IBD. Data
      supporting their use include a large number of antibiotic studies in Crohn's
      disease and evidence suggests antibiotics are efficacious in both Crohn's disease
      and ulcerative colitis, although there are fewer studies of the latter. For
      Crohn's disease, antibiotics have been shown to be useful for the induction of
      remission and in the postoperative management of patients undergoing surgery.
      Additionally, patients with fistulizing disease, particularly perianal, can
      benefit from antibiotics administered short term. Both antimicrobials and
      probiotics have been shown to be useful for the treatment of pouchitis.
      Additional randomized controlled trials are needed to further elucidate the role 
      of bacteria in IBD and to better inform clinicians about appropriate antibiotic
      therapies.

      and practice.

AB  - It is important to have clear goals for treating inflammatory bowel disease in
      clinical practice and in research. Conventional end points for trials in
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease have been based on composite indices, such
      as the Mayo Clinic Score and the Crohn's Disease Activity Index; these indices
      incorporate symptoms, signs, and findings from laboratory tests and sometimes
      endoscopic assessments. Although definitions of clinical response and remission
      have been based on these indices for regulatory purposes, they are difficult to
      apply to practice because they are complex and not intuitive to clinicians. This 
      has caused a disconnect between clinical trials and practice. Recently, the use
      of composite indices in trials has been reevaluated in Food and Drug
      Administration-sponsored Gastroenterology Regulatory Endpoints and the
      Advancement of Therapeutics workshops due to concerns about the validity of the
      indices. Alternative measures of outcome and definitions of response are being
      developed. Patient-reported outcomes are psychometric instruments created and
      defined by patients to quantify symptoms. A combination of end points, comprising
      patient-reported outcomes and objective evaluation of inflammation by endoscopy, 
      offers a clinically meaningful and scientifically valid alternative to existing
      composite indices. Unlike composite indices, response definitions based on
      endoscopy and patient-reported outcomes can be readily applied in practice. This 
      convergence of outcome assessment in clinical trials and practice could expedite 
      implementation of "treat-to-target" algorithms, in which therapy is progressively
      intensified until a specific treatment goal is reached. This approach could
      improve patient care by reducing rates of disease-related complications, surgery,
      and hospitalization.

TI  - Small-molecule screening identifies inhibition of salt-inducible kinases as a
      therapeutic strategy to enhance immunoregulatory functions of dendritic cells.
PG  - 12468-73
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1412308111 [doi]
AB  - Genetic alterations that reduce the function of the immunoregulatory cytokine
      IL-10 contribute to colitis in mouse and man. Myeloid cells such as macrophages
      (MPhis) and dendritic cells (DCs) play an essential role in determining the
      relative abundance of IL-10 versus inflammatory cytokines in the gut. As such,
      using small molecules to boost IL-10 production by DCs-MPhis represents a
      promising approach to increase levels of this cytokine specifically in gut
      tissues. Toward this end, we screened a library of well-annotated kinase
      inhibitors for compounds that enhance production of IL-10 by murine
      bone-marrow-derived DCs stimulated with the yeast cell wall preparation zymosan. 
      This approach identified a number of kinase inhibitors that robustly up-regulate 
      IL-10 production including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs 
      dasatinib, bosutinib, and saracatinib that target ABL, SRC-family, and numerous
      other kinases. Correlating the kinase selectivity profiles of the active
      compounds with their effect on IL-10 production suggests that inhibition of
      salt-inducible kinases (SIKs) mediates the observed IL-10 increase. This was
      confirmed using the SIK-targeting inhibitor HG-9-91-01 and a series of structural
      analogs. The stimulatory effect of SIK inhibition on IL-10 is also associated
      with decreased production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-12,
      and TNF-alpha, and these coordinated effects are observed in human DCs-MPhis and 
      anti-inflammatory CD11c(+) CX3CR1(hi) cells isolated from murine gut tissue.
      Collectively, these studies demonstrate that SIK inhibition promotes an
      anti-inflammatory phenotype in activated myeloid cells marked by robust IL-10
      production and establish these effects as a previously unidentified activity
      associated with several FDA-approved multikinase inhibitors.

TI  - Food antigen-induced immune responses in Crohn's disease patients and
      experimental colitis mice.
PG  - 394-405
LID - 10.1007/s00535-014-0981-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Crohn's disease (CD), the involvement of food antigens in immune
      responses remains unclear. The objective of this study was to detect immune
      responses against food antigens in CD patients and examine the mechanism in a
      mouse model of colitis. METHODS: We enrolled 98 CD patients, 50 ulcerative
      colitis patients, and 52 healthy controls (HCs) to compare the levels of serum
      immunoglobulin (Ig)Gs against 88 foods. The presence of serum IgGs against foods 
      was also examined in interleukin (IL)-10 knockout (KO) mice in which CD4(+) T
      cell activation by antigenic food protein was assessed. Mice transferred with
      IL-10 KO cells received diets with or without food antigens, and the development 
      of colitis was evaluated. RESULTS: The prevalence of IgGs against various foods, 
      especially vegetables, grains, and nuts, was significantly higher in CD patients 
      than in HCs. Similarly, the prevalence of IgGs against food proteins was higher
      in IL-10 KO mice than in BALB/c mice. Beta-conglycinin, identified as an
      antigenic food proteins in IL-10 KO mice, induced CD4(+) T cell production of
      interferon-gamma and IL-17 through dendritic cell antigen presentation.
      Elimination of the food antigens ameliorated the development of colitis in mice
      without altering the composition of their intestinal microbiota. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      CD colitis mice, intestinal inflammation via CD4(+) T cell hyperactivation was
      induced by food antigens associated with high serum IgG levels and was
      ameliorated by the elimination of food antigens. This disrupted immunological
      tolerance to food antigen, which might act as an exacerbating factor, remains to 
      be elucidated in CD patients.

TI  - Smoking cessation alters intestinal microbiota: insights from quantitative
      investigations on human fecal samples using FISH.
PG  - 1496-501
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000129 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There has been a dramatic increase in investigations on the potential
      mechanistic role of the intestinal microbiota in various diseases and factors
      modulating intestinal microbial composition. We recently reported on intestinal
      microbial shifts after smoking cessation in humans. In this study, we aimed to
      conduct further microbial analyses and verify our previous results obtained by
      pyrosequencing using a direct quantitative microbial approach. METHODS: Stool
      samples of healthy smoking human subjects undergoing controlled smoking cessation
      during a 9-week observational period were analyzed and compared with 2 control
      groups, ongoing smoking and nonsmoking subjects. Fluorescence in situ
      hybridization was applied to quantify specific bacterial groups. RESULTS:
      Intestinal microbiota composition was substantially altered after smoking
      cessation as characterized by an increase in key representatives from the phyla
      of Firmicutes (Clostridium coccoides, Eubacterium rectale, and Clostridium leptum
      subgroup) and Actinobacteria (HGC bacteria and Bifidobacteria) as well as a
      decrease in Bacteroidetes (Prevotella spp. and Bacteroides spp.) and
      Proteobacteria (beta- and gamma-subgroup of Proteobacteria). CONCLUSIONS: As
      determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization, an independent direct
      quantitative microbial approach, we could confirm that intestinal microbiota
      composition in humans is influenced by smoking. The characteristics of observed
      microbial shifts suggest a potential mechanistic association to alterations in
      body weight subsequent to smoking cessation. More importantly, regarding
      previously described microbial hallmarks of dysbiosis in inflammatory bowel
      diseases, a variety of observed microbial alterations after smoking cessation
      deserve further consideration in view of the divergent effect of smoking on the
      clinical course of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Ulcerative colitis as a polymicrobial infection characterized by sustained broken
      mucus barrier.
PG  - 9468-75
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i28.9468 [doi]
AB  - To reduce medication for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), we need to
      establish the etiology of UC. The intestinal microbiota of patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been shown to differ from that of healthy
      controls and abundant data indicate that it changes in both composition and
      localization. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is significantly higher in
      IBD patients compared with controls. Probiotics have been investigated for their 
      capacity to reduce the severity of UC. The luminal surfaces of the
      gastrointestinal tract are covered by a mucus layer. This normally acts as a
      barrier that does not allow bacteria to reach the epithelial cells and thus
      limits the direct contact between the host and the bacteria. The mucus layer in
      the colon comprises an inner layer that is firmly adherent to the intestinal
      mucosa, and an outer layer that can be washed off with minimal rinsing. Some
      bacteria can dissolve the protective inner mucus layer. Defects in renewal and
      formation of the inner mucus layer allow bacteria to reach the epithelium and
      have implications for the causes of colitis. In this review, important elements
      of UC pathology are thought to be the intestinal bacteria, gut mucus, and the
      mucosa-associated immune system.

TI  - Amelioration of colitis in mouse model by exploring antioxidative potentials of
      an indigenous probiotic strain of Lactobacillus fermentum Lf1.
PG  - 206732
LID - 10.1155/2014/206732 [doi]
AB  - Based on the preliminary screening of eight indigenous putative probiotic
      Lactobacilli, Lactobacillus fermentum Lf1 was selected for assessing its
      antioxidative efficacy in DSS colitis mouse model based on its ability to enhance
      the expression of "Nrf2" by 6.43-fold and malondialdehyde (MDA) inhibition by
      78.1 +/- 0.24% in HT-29 cells under H2O2 stress. The Disease Activity Index and
      histological scores of Lf1-treated mice were lower than the control group.
      However, expression of "Nrf2" was not observed in Lf1-treated mice. A significant
      increase in the expression of antioxidative enzymes such as SOD2 and TrxR-1 was
      recorded in both of the groups. The expression of SOD2 was significantly
      downregulated in colitis-induced mice by -100.00-fold relative to control group, 
      and the downregulation was considerably reduced to -37.04-fold in colitis Lf1
      treatment group. Almost, a similar trend was recorded in case of "thioredoxin"
      expression, though "CAT" was refractile to expression. The Lf1-treated group had 
      decreased malondialdehyde level as compared to colitis control (37.92 +/- 6.31
      versus 91.13 +/- 5.76 muM/g). These results point towards Lf1-induced activation 
      of the antioxidant enzyme system in the mouse model and its prospects to be
      explored as a new strategy for IBD management.

TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus attenuates downregulation of DRA function and
      expression in inflammatory models.
PG  - G623-31
LID - 10.1152/ajpgi.00104.2014 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics, including Lactobacilli, are commensal bacteria that have been used in
      clinical trials and experimental models for the prevention and treatment of
      diarrheal disorders. Our previous studies have shown that Lactobacillus
      acidophilus (LA) and its culture supernatant (CS) stimulated Cl(-)/HCO3 (-)
      exchange activity, acutely via an increase in the surface levels of downregulated
      in adenoma (DRA, SLC26A3) and in long-term treatments via increasing its
      expression involving transcriptional mechanisms. However, the role of LA in
      modulating DRA activity under inflammatory conditions is not known. Current in
      vitro studies using human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells examined the
      efficacy of LA or its CS in counteracting the inhibitory effects of
      interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) on Cl(-)/HCO3 (-) exchange activity. Pretreatment of
      cells with LA or LA-CS for 1 h followed by coincubation with IFN-gamma
      significantly alleviated the inhibitory effects of IFN-gamma on Cl(-)/HCO3 (-)
      exchange activity. In the in vivo model of dextran sulfate sodium-induced
      experimental colitis (3% in drinking water for 7 days) in C57BL/6J mice,
      administration of live LA (3 x 10(9) colony-forming units) via oral gavage
      attenuated colonic inflammation. LA administration also counteracted the
      colitis-induced decrease in DRA mRNA and protein levels. Efficacy of LA or its
      secreted soluble factors in alleviating inflammation and inflammation-associated 
      dysregulation of DRA activity could justify their therapeutic potential in
      inflammatory diarrheal diseases.

TI  - The role of vitamin D in gastrointestinal inflammation.
PG  - 909-23
LID - 10.1586/17474124.2014.925796 [doi]
AB  - The emerging role of vitamin D as a regulator of both innate and adaptive immune 
      responses has encouraged the investigation of its role in the pathogenesis of a
      variety of autoimmune conditions including the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD),
      Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Animal models consistently demonstrate
      that vitamin D significantly impacts on the modulation of astrointestinal
      inflammation, while epidemiological and observational data show an inverse
      relationship between vitamin D status and the onset/progression of Crohn's
      disease as well as the development of colorectal cancer. As vitamin D
      supplementation is readily available, at low cost, it is a very attractive
      potential therapeutic option. The biological plausibility for a role for vitamin 
      D in inflammation modulation, the potential genetic links associated with vitamin
      D metabolism and the clinical aspects for it in IBD will be discussed.

PG  - 1481-6
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000055 [doi]
AB  - Pouchitis is a common complication seen in patients with ulcerative colitis who
      undergo total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis. Bacteria seem to
      play an important role in the development of pouchitis, although this role is not
      well defined. Because technology has advanced, we are able to apply molecular
      techniques to describe the structure and function of the pouch microbial
      community. In recent years, several studies have been performed comparing the
      pouch microbiota in patients with ulcerative colitis with healthy pouches and
      pouchitis. Many of these studies have suggested that pouchitis is characterized
      by dysbiosis and/or decreased microbial diversity. There has not been a clear
      pattern identifying a pathogenic organism or a group of organisms responsible for
      pouchitis. This review summarizes recent studies exploring the pouch microbiota
      in health and disease, the relationship of bacterial metabolites and pouchitis,
      and the role of antibiotics and probiotics for the treatment and prevention of
      pouchitis.

TI  - Diet, microbiota, and inflammatory bowel disease: lessons from Japanese foods.
PG  - 409-15
LID - 10.3904/kjim.2014.29.4.409 [doi]
AB  - The incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) including
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease are rapidly increasing in Western countries 
      and in developed Asian countries. Although biologic agents targeting the immune
      system have been effective in patients with IBD, cessation of treatment leads to 
      relapse in the majority of patients, suggesting that intrinsic immune
      dysregulation is an effect, not a cause, of IBD. Dramatic changes in the
      environment, resulting in the dysregulated composition of intestinal microbiota
      or dysbiosis, may be associated with the fundamental causes of IBD. Japan now has
      upgraded water supply and sewerage systems, as well as dietary habits and
      antibiotic overuse that are similar to such features found in developed Western
      countries. The purpose of this review article was to describe the association of 
      diet, particularly Japanese food and microbiota, with IBD.

TI  - Microscopic colitis: a review.
PG  - 957-64

AB  - AIM: In recent years, microscopic colitis has been increasingly diagnosed. This
      review was carried out to evaluate demographic factors for microscopic colitis
      and to perform a systematic assessment of available treatment options. METHOD:
      Relevant publications up to December 2013 were identified following searches of
      PubMed and Google Scholar using the key words 'microscopic colitis', 'collagenous
      colitis' and 'lymphocytic colitis'. Two-hundred and forty-eight articles were
      identified. RESULTS: The term microscopic colitis includes lymphocytic colitis
      and collagenous colitis. Both have common clinical symptoms but are well defined 
      histopathologically. The clinical course is usually benign, but serious
      complications, including death, may occur. A peak incidence from 60 to 70 years
      of age with a female preponderance is observed. Although most cases are
      idiopathic, associations with autoimmune disorders, such as coeliac disease and
      hypothyroidism, as well as with exposure to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
      and proton-pump inhibitors, have been observed. The incidence and prevalence of
      microscopic colitis is rising and good-quality epidemiological research is
      needed. Treatment is currently largely based on anecdotal evidence and on results
      from limited clinical trials of budesonide. Long-term follow-up of these patients
      is not well established. CONCLUSION: The review synthesizes work on the
      definition of microscopic colitis and the relationship between collagenous and
      lymphocytic colitis. It reviews the international epidemiology and work on
      aetiology. In addition, it critically considers the efficacy of a range of
      treatments.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Colonic fermentation in patients with UC in remission was compared
      with that in matched healthy subjects on habitual diets and when dietary fibre
      was increased. DESIGN: Fibre intake, faecal output of fibre (measured as
      non-starch polysaccharide (NSP)), starch, microbiota and fermentation products,
      and whole gut transit time (WGTT) were assessed in association with habitual diet
      and when dietary intake of wheat bran (WB)-associated fibre and high
      amylose-associated resistant starch (RS) was increased in an 8-week, randomised, 
      single-blind, cross-over study. RESULTS: Despite a tendency to lower habitual
      fibre intake in UC patients, faecal NSP and starch concentrations were threefold 
      higher than in controls, whereas concentrations of phenols and short-chain fatty 
      acids, pH and WGTT were similar. Increasing RS/WB intake was well tolerated. In
      controls (n=10), it more than doubled faecal NSP and starch excretion (p=0.002
      for both), had no effect on NSP usage and reduced WGTT (p=0.024). In UC patients 
      (n=19), high intake of RS/WB tended to normalise gut transit, but did not
      increase the proportion of NSP fermented. Increasing intake of RS/WB had little
      effect on faecal fermentation patterns or the structure of the microbiota.
      However, faeces from the UC cohort had lower proportions of Akkermansia
      muciniphila and increased diversity within Clostridium cluster XIVa compared to
      controls. CONCLUSIONS: Gut fermentation of NSP and starch is diminished in
      patients with UC. This cannot be explained by abnormal gut transit and was not
      corrected by increasing RS/WB intake, and may be due to abnormal functioning of
      the gut microbiota. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Australian New Zealand Clinical

TI  - Lactobacillus casei and bifidobacterium lactis supplementation reduces tissue
      damage of intestinal mucosa and liver after 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid
      treatment in mice.
PG  - 251-61
AB  - Probiotics (PB) are living microorganisms that act as a commensal population in
      normal intestines and confer numerous beneficial effects on the host. The
      introduction of probiotics in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      prolongs remission. The aim of this study was to investigate the intestinal and
      hepatic effects of PB supplementation in an experimental IBD model in mice
      induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). In the first step of the
      experimental procedure, CD-1 male mice, 5 to 6 weeks old, were randomly divided
      into 3 groups and inoculated intrarectally with, respectively, saline, alcohol,
      or TNBS to assess the experimental IBD model. In the second step, mice treated,
      or not, with TNBS inoculation, were treated with PB (Lactobacillus Casei,
      Bifidobacterum Lactis) for 1, 2 or 3 weeks, on a daily basis. Large bowel (colon 
      and rectum) and liver were processed for histological alterations, according to a
      scoring system. Large bowel was also assessed for apoptosis by TUNEL assay. TNBS 
      induced, as expected, severe damage and inflammation in the large bowel,
      including nuclear alterations and apoptosis, and, to a lesser extent, to the
      liver. Administration of PB determined significant reduction of both histological
      alterations and apoptosis. PB administration in advance protects from
      inflammation. In conclusion, supplementation with Lactobacillus casei,
      Bifidobacterum lactis PB is able to ameliorate the colitis by reversing the
      histological changes caused by TNBS in mice. Experimentation in human subjects in
      needed to prove their efficacy in reducing histological alterations that may be
      present in subjects with IBD.

LID - 10.1155/2014/351204 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an autoimmune disease characterized by a
      chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract mucosa and is related to an
      abnormal immune response to commensal bacteria. Our aim of the present work has
      been to explore the levels of antibodies (IgG and IgA) raised against
      extracellular proteins produced by LAB and its association with IBD. We analyzed,
      by Western-blot and ELISA, the presence of serum antibodies (IgA and IgG)
      developed against extracellular protein fractions produced by different food
      bacteria from the genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. We used a sera
      collection consisting of healthy individuals (HC, n = 50), Crohn's disease
      patients (CD, n = 37), and ulcerative colitis patients (UC, n = 15). Levels of
      IgA antibodies developed against a cell-wall hydrolase from Lactobacillus casei
      subsp. rhamnosus GG (CWH) were significantly higher in the IBD group (P < 0.002; 
      n = 52). The specificity of our measurements was confirmed by measuring IgA
      antibodies developed against the CWH peptide 365-VNTSNQTAAVSAS-377. IBD patients 
      appeared to have different immune response to food bacteria. This paper sets the 
      basis for developing systems for early detection of IBD, based on the association
      of high levels of antibodies developed against extracellular proteins from food
      and probiotic bacteria.

      difficile-induced IL-8 production by colonic epithelial cells.
PG  - 177
LID - 10.1186/1471-2180-14-177 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile is the main cause of hospital-acquired diarrhea
      and colitis known as C. difficile-associated disease (CDAD).With increased
      severity and failure of treatment in CDAD, new approaches for prevention and
      treatment, such as the use of probiotics, are needed. Since the pathogenesis of
      CDAD involves an inflammatory response with a massive influx of neutrophils
      recruited by interleukin (IL)-8, this study aimed to investigate the probiotic
      effects of Lactobacillus spp. on the suppression of IL-8 production in response
      to C. difficile infection. RESULTS: We screened Lactobacillus conditioned media
      from 34 infant fecal isolates for the ability to suppress C. difficile-induced
      IL-8 production from HT-29 cells. Factors produced by two vancomycin-resistant
      lactobacilli, L. rhamnosus L34 (LR-L34) and L.casei L39 (LC-L39), suppressed the 
      secretion and transcription of IL-8 without inhibiting C. difficile viability or 
      toxin production. Conditioned media from LR-L34 suppressed the activation of
      phospho-NF-kappaB with no effect on phospho-c-Jun. However, LC-L39 conditioned
      media suppressed the activation of both phospho-NF-kappaB and phospho-c-Jun.
      Conditioned media from LR-L34 and LC-L39 also decreased the production of C.
      difficile-induced GM-CSF in HT-29 cells. Immunomodulatory factors present in the 
      conditioned media of both LR-L34 and LC-L39 are heat-stable up to 100 degrees C
      and > 100 kDa in size. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that L. rhamnosus L34 and
      L. casei L39 each produce factors capable of modulating inflammation stimulated
      by C. difficile. These vancomycin-resistant Lactobacillus strains are potential
      probiotics for treating or preventing CDAD.

TI  - Influence of exclusive enteral nutrition therapy on visceral fat in patients with
      Crohn's disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mesenteric fat plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's
      disease (CD), and a higher ratio of visceral fat area (VFA) to subcutaneous fat
      area (SFA) is related to complicated disease status. Exclusive enteral nutrition 
      (EEN) is an effective treatment option for patients with CD, and the aims of this
      study were to assess the effects of EEN on abdominal fat in patients with CD.
      METHODS: Patient data were obtained from a prospectively maintained database. The
      SFA and VFA were measured in 38 patients with CD before and after 8-week EEN
      therapy, and the mesenteric fat index (MFI), defined as the ratio of VFA to SFA, 
      was calculated. The correlations between MFI and CD activity index and C-reactive
      protein level were also evaluated. RESULTS: The median age of the patients in our
      study was 29 years, and the median duration of disease was 3.05 years. Both VFA
      (P = 0.029) and MFI (P = 0.021) were significantly decreased in patients after
      EEN, but no significant change was observed in SFA (P = 0.335). MFI was
      significantly correlated with CD activity index (r = 0.523, P = 0.001) and
      C-reactive protein (r = 0.634, P < 0.0001) in patients with active CD before EEN,
      although no positive correlations were observed in patients after EEN treatment. 
      CONCLUSIONS: EEN induction therapy was associated with a significant decrease in 
      VFA in patients with CD, and MFI was significantly correlated with CD activity
      index and C-reactive protein in active CD. Thus, our data reveal additional
      beneficial therapeutic mechanisms of enteral nutrition treatment in CD.

TI  - Ciprofloxacin and probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle add-on treatment in active
      ulcerative colitis: a double-blind randomized placebo controlled clinical trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel
      disease. The probiotic bacterium Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) has been used
      to maintain and induce clinical remission in UC. Our aim was to test the effect
      of Ciprofloxacin and/or orally administered EcN as add-on to conventional
      therapies in patients with active UC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our single center
      double-blinded randomized placebo controlled study included patients with a
      Colitis Activity Index (CAI) score of at least 6. Patients were randomized to
      Ciprofloxacin or placebo for 1week followed by EcN or placebo for 7weeks. All 4
      treatments were given as add-on treatments. RESULTS: One hundred subjects with
      active UC were recruited. In the per-protocol analysis we, surprisingly, found
      that in the group receiving placebo/EcN fewer patients, 54%, reached remission
      compared to the group receiving placebo/placebo, 89%, p<0.05. Among patients
      treated with Cipro/placebo and Cipro/EcN, 78% and 66% reached remission,
      respectively. Furthermore, the group receiving placebo/EcN had the largest number
      of withdrawals, 11 of 25 (44%), compared to 15 of 75 (20%) in any of the other
      groups, p<0.05. Indication of lack of mucosal healing was found in the group
      treated with placebo/Nissle, since only 4 (29%) of the 14 patients, who completed
      the study, reported no blood in stools at week 12 (p<0.02), compared to 63%, 67% 
      and 65% in groups treated with Cipro/Nissle, Cipro/placebo and placebo/placebo,
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that there is no benefit in the use
      of E. coli Nissle as an add-on treatment to conventional therapies for active
      ulcerative colitis. Furthermore, treatment with E. coli Nissle without a previous
      antibiotic cure resulted in fewer patients reaching clinical remission.

TI  - Modulating the microbiota in inflammatory bowel diseases: prebiotics, probiotics 
      or faecal transplantation?
PG  - 490-7
LID - 10.1017/S0029665114000639 [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are the two major phenotypes of 
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) which constitute a spectrum of chronic,
      debilitating diseases characterised by a relapsing inflammation of the intestinal
      mucosal lining. Evidence from a variety of disciplines implicates the intestinal 
      microbiota in the pathogenesis of idiopathic IBD and their complications,
      including pouchitis. Many studies have reported a dysbiosis in IBD, characterised
      by a decrease in diversity, a decreased abundance of some dominant commensal
      members (such as Clostridium IV and XIVa) and an increase in detrimental bacteria
      (such as sulphate reducing bacteria and Escherichia coli). Therapies such as
      prebiotics and probiotics aim to selectively manipulate the intestinal microbiota
      and have been evaluated as an attractive therapeutic option with few side
      effects. The multispecies product VSL#3 was found effective in preventing and
      maintaining remission in pouchitis, whereas both VSL#3 and E. coli Nissle were
      effective in maintaining remission in UC. A more drastic approach to restore the 
      composition of the microbiota and correct the underlying imbalance is a faecal
      microbiota transplantation (FMT). FMT has been successfully applied to treat
      patients with even recalcitrant Clostridium difficile infection. Particularly in 
      UC, the majority of studies suggest that FMT may be an effective treatment option
      although the evidence is still limited. It is anticipated that our increasing
      knowledge on the composition and function of the intestinal microbiota components
      will allow in the future for a better selection of highly performing bacteria
      with specific functions required for specific benefits.

      Minas Frescal cheese commercialized in Goiania, GO.
PG  - 7-10
AB  - Escherichia coli O157:H7 has been incriminated in food poisoning outbreaks and
      sporadic cases of hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome in many
      countries. Considering the high susceptibility of Minas Frescal cheese to
      contamination by E. coli O157:H7, the aim of this study was to determine the
      occurrence of this pathogen through PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) and ELISA
      (VIDAS ECO O157((R)), bioMerieux, Lyon, France) test. Thirty cheese samples
      manufactured by artisan farmhouse producers were collected from open-air markets 
      in Goiania and thirty from industries under Federal Inspection located in Goias
      State which trade their products in supermarkets in Goiania. E. coli O157:H7 was 
      detected in 6.67% samples collected in open air markets using ELISA, and 23,33%
      with PCR. The pathogen was not detected in samples from industries under Federal 
      Inspection.

TI  - A prospective, randomized, controlled, exploratory study of comprehensive dietary

PG  - 910-7
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0000000000000127 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The impact of food on relapse in ulcerative colitis has not been
      clearly defined. The aim of this prospective, randomized-controlled study was to 
      evaluate the impact of comprehensive dietary guidelines on the clinical course of
      the disease and quality of life in patients with ulcerative colitis. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: Patients were allocated randomly to an intervention or a control
      group. Participants in the intervention group were provided dietary guidelines in
      the form of an educational booklet that was recommended for use for 4-6 weeks
      during disease flare, that patients eat little and often (four to six times a
      day), drink adequate fluids, decrease excess intake of fat, decrease simple
      carbohydrates and decrease high-fibre foods during flare.Validated and
      study-designed questionnaires were used to compare patients' perceived quality of
      life, colitis activity scores and eating habits before and following the dietary 
      advice provided. RESULTS: Overall, 112 patients completed the study. Study
      participants were asked to complete the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire 
      and Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index together with the Food Frequency
      Questionnaire at 0, 6 and 24 weeks. At 24 weeks, there was a mean reduction in
      the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index score in the intervention group
      compared with an increase in the score in the control group [-1.304 (P=0.0108)
      vs. 0.875 (P=0.0249)]. There was a mean increase in the Inflammatory Bowel
      Disease Questionnaire score in the intervention group compared with a reduction
      in the score in the control group [7.17 (P=0.126) vs. -3.44 (P=0.205)]. A total
      of 69% of patients in the intervention group found the dietary advice
      significantly or moderately helpful. CONCLUSION: The study suggests that there is
      likely to be a link between the dietary advice provided and symptomatic
      improvement. The effect of diet may not occur through the addition or the
      elimination of single nutrients; rather, each food consumed combines many
      nutrients that allow for a synergistic or an antagonistic action when present in 
      a certain composition.

TI  - Variable access to quality nutrition information regarding inflammatory bowel
      disease: a survey of patients and health professionals and objective examination 
      of written information.
PG  - 2501-12
LID - 10.1111/hex.12219 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) report a range of
      nutritional and dietary problems and high-quality written information should be
      available on these. There is little research investigating the availability and
      quality of such information for patients with IBD. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed
      the type and quality of written information on nutrition and diet available to
      patients with IBD and the opinions of patients and health professionals. SETTING 
      AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-two patients with IBD were recruited from a large
      gastroenterology outpatient centre in England. One hundred dietitians from across
      the United Kingdom were also recruited. METHODS: Face-to-face surveys were
      conducted with patients with IBD. Questions regarding the use, format and
      usefulness of dietary information received were probed. Dietitians were surveyed 
      regarding written dietary information used in clinical practice. Samples of
      IBD-specific dietary information used across the UK were objectively assessed
      using two validated tools. MAIN RESULTS: The majority of patients rated written
      information as 'good' or 'very good', with the most useful information relating
      to 'general diet and IBD'. Forty-nine (49%) dietitians reported gaps in written
      information available for patients with IBD. Fifty-three different samples of
      IBD-specific information sheets were returned, with widely variable objective
      quality ratings. Commercially produced written information scored greater than
      locally produced information (BMA tool, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patient access to
      high-quality, written, IBD-specific dietary information is variable. IBD-specific
      written nutrition information needs to be developed in accordance with validated 
      tools to empower patients, encourage self-management and overcome nutritional
      implications of IBD.

LID - 10.1021/ja503450q [doi]
AB  - The gene cluster responsible for synthesis of the unknown molecule "colibactin"
      has been identified in mutualistic and pathogenic Escherichia coli. The pathway
      endows its producer with a long-term persistence phenotype in the human bowel, a 
      probiotic activity used in the treatment of ulcerative colitis, and a
      carcinogenic activity under host inflammatory conditions. To date, functional
      small molecules from this pathway have not been reported. Here we implemented a
      comparative metabolomics and targeted structural network analyses approach to
      identify a catalog of small molecules dependent on the colibactin pathway from
      the meningitis isolate E. coli IHE3034 and the probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917. The
      structures of 10 pathway-dependent small molecules are proposed based on
      structural characterizations and network relationships. The network will provide 
      a roadmap for the structural and functional elucidation of a variety of other
      small molecules encoded by the pathway. From the characterized small molecule
      set, in vitro bacterial growth inhibitory and mammalian CNS receptor antagonist
      activities are presented.

TI  - [Saccharomyces boulardii in the treatment and prevention of antibiotic-associated
      diarrhea].
PG  - 18-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) is the most frequent side effect
      of antibiotic therapy. Clinical signs and symptoms comprise mild and
      self-limiting courses of diarrhea as well as life threatening courses like
      pseudomembranous colitis or toxic megacolon. Therapy is symptomatic,
      antidiarrheal drugs like Saccharomyces boulardii are the therapy of choice.
      METHOD: Available studies on S. boulardii in the prevention of AAD are presented 
      as a review. RESULTS: In 14 out of 17 studies including 4,627 patients the
      administration of S. boulardii achieved a protective effect between 43.7% and
      87.3%. A meta-analysis (5 studies, 1,076 patients) showed a significant reduction
      of the risk to develop an AAD from 17.2% to 6.7%,in a furthermeta-analysis (4
      studies on eradication of H. pylori, 1,215 patients) the significant
      reductionwasfrom 12.2% to 5.6%. CONCLUSIONS: There is very good evidence for the 
      yeast S. boulardii to be effective in the prevention of AAD especially in
      hospitalized adults. The simultaneous administration of S. boulardii to
      antibiotics resulted in a significant reduction to develop AAD by more than half.

TI  - Maintenance of optimal vitamin D status in children and adolescents with
      inflammatory bowel disease: a randomized clinical trial comparing two regimens.
PG  - 3408-17
LID - 10.1210/jc.2013-4218 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Vitamin D promotes bone health and regulates the immune system, both
      important actions for pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
      The supplementation dose that would maintain optimal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D
      concentration (25OHD >/= 32 ng/mL) is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the
      study was to compare two supplementation regimens' efficacy and safety in
      maintaining optimal 25OHD in children with IBD. DESIGN: This was a randomized,
      not blinded, controlled trial. SETTING: The trial was conducted in the Boston
      Children's Hospital Clinical and Translational Study Unit. PARTICIPANTS:
      Sixty-three patients, aged 8-18 years with IBD and baseline 25OHD greater than 20
      ng/mL were enrolled; 48 completed the study, and one withdrew for adverse events.
      INTERVENTION: Arm A received 400 IU of oral vitamin D2 daily (n = 32). Arm B
      received 1000 IU daily in the summer/fall and 2000 IU in the winter/spring (n =
      31). MAIN OUTCOME: The main outcome was the probability of maintaining 25OHD of
      32 ng/mL or greater in all trimonthly visits for 12 months. RESULTS: Three
      participants in arm A (9.4%) and three in arm B (9.7%) achieved the primary
      outcome (P = .97). The incidence of adverse events, all minor, did not differ.
      More participants in arm A developed C-reactive protein level of 1 mg/dL or
      greater (31% vs 10%, P = .04) and IL-6 greater than 3 pg/mL (54% vs 27%, P =
      .05). CONCLUSIONS: Daily oral vitamin D2 doses up to 2000 IU were inadequate to
      maintain optimal 25OHD but were well tolerated. The finding of lower incidence of
      elevated inflammatory markers and cytokines among participants receiving higher
      vitamin D2 doses merits further study.

PG  - 1562-7
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000084 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: VSL#3 is a probiotic mix preparation reported to be effective in the 
      treatment of mild to moderately active ulcerative colitis. We aimed to perform a 
      systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis of studies on its
      efficacy. METHODS: The searched databases included PubMed, Scopus, and
      ScienceDirect. The Mantel-Haenszel method was used to pool the effect- ize across
      studies, and the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of
      experiencing a specific outcome were calculated. RESULTS: Five studies with 441
      patients were identified. The pooled remission rate was 49.4% (95% CI,
      42.7-56.1). Only 3 low risk of bias studies with 319 patients met the inclusion
      criteria for further analysis. A total of 162 patients received 3.6 x 10 CFU/d
      VSL#3, and 157 patients received placebo. A total of 95% of patients received
      concomitant therapies with 5-ASA and/or immunomodulators. The Ulcerative Colitis 
      Disease Activity Index was used to define response and remission. A >50% decrease
      in the Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index was achieved in 44.6% of the
      VSL#3-treated patients versus 25.1% of the patients given placebo (P = 0008; OR, 
      2.793; 95% CI, 1.375-5.676; number needed to treat = 4-5). The response rate was 
      53.4% in VSL#3-treated patients versus 29.3% in patients given placebo (P < 0001;
      OR, 3.03; 95% CI, 1.89-4.83; number needed to treat = 3-4). The remission rate
      was 43.8% in VSL#3-treated patients versus 24.8% in patients given placebo (P =
      0007; OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.48-3.88; number needed to treat = 4-5). No serious side 
      effects were reported. CONCLUSIONS: VSL#3, when added to conventional therapy at 
      a daily dose of 3.6 x 10 CFU/d, is safe and more effective than conventional
      therapy alone in achieving higher response and remission rates in mild to
      moderately active ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Pancreatitis-associated protein has no additional value as a marker of disease
      activity in a real-life cohort of IBD patients.
PG  - 902-9
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0000000000000141 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Monitoring of mucosal inflammation in inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) is of major importance. New noninvasive markers for intestinal
      inflammation are needed. Previous studies have reported that
      pancreatitis-associated protein (PAP) correlates with clinical activity in IBD
      subgroups. Our aim was to investigate the correlation of serum and fecal PAP with
      clinical and biochemical parameters of disease activity in a real-life IBD
      cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred and five consecutive IBD patients were 
      enrolled. Clinical disease activity was scored by the Harvey-Bradshaw Index or
      the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index; also, C-reactive protein (CRP),
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and fecal calprotectin were determined. As
      surrogate for endoscopy, a combination score of clinical indices with CRP or
      calprotectin was used to define active disease. Fecal and serum PAP were measured
      by ELISA. RESULTS: The median serum and fecal PAP did not differ in Crohn's
      disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) patients with active compared with
      inactive disease according to clinical activity indices. Defining active disease 
      by a combination score of Harvey-Bradshaw Index of more than 4 and CRP of more
      than 5 mg/l or calprotectin more than 250 microg/g, serum PAP (P=0.01), but not
      fecal PAP (P=0.32), was significantly higher in active than inactive CD patients.
      Area under the curve of the corresponding receiver operating curve (ROC) was
      0.64. No differences were found in serum or fecal PAP levels using the
      combination score for active disease in UC. CONCLUSION: Serum but not fecal PAP
      was higher in active compared with nonactive CD and may reflect mucosal
      inflammation in CD, but not in UC. However, the accuracy of serum PAP for the
      diagnosis of active disease was poor, and therefore, serum PAP does not seem to
      have additional value compared with the current noninvasive markers.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) with its two major forms Crohn's disease (CD)
      and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic relapsing disorders leading to
      inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Although the precise aetiology of IBD
      remains unclear, several factors are believed to contribute to disease
      pathogenesis. Among these, the role of the intestinal microbiota has become more 
      and more appreciated. Evidence from experimental and clinical studies strongly
      suggests that chronic intestinal inflammation results from a dysregulated immune 
      response towards components of the microbiota in genetically susceptible hosts.
      The growing perception of the microbiota as a major driver of disease
      pathogenesis raises the question, if the intestinal microbiota can be used as a
      therapeutic target in CD. Based on what we know about host microbiota
      interactions in health and disease, the objective of this review is to address
      the question if the microbiota holds the key to the future therapy in CD.

AB  - The mucus layer coating the gastrointestinal tract serves as the first line of
      intestinal defense against infection and injury. Probiotics promote mucin
      production by goblet cells in the intestine. p40, a Lactobacillus rhamnosus
      GG-derived soluble protein, has been shown to transactivate the EGF receptor
      (EGFR) in intestinal epithelial cells, which is required for inhibition of
      apoptosis and preservation of barrier function in the colon, thereby ameliorating
      intestinal injury and colitis. Because activation of EGFR has been shown to
      up-regulate mucin production in goblet cells, the purpose of this study was to
      investigate the effects and mechanisms of p40 regulation of mucin production. p40
      activated EGFR and its downstream target, Akt, in a concentration-dependent
      manner in LS174T cells. p40 stimulated Muc2 gene expression and mucin production 
      in LS174T cells, which were abolished by inhibition of EGFR kinase activity,
      down-regulation of EGFR expression by EGFR siRNA transfection, or suppression of 
      Akt activation. Treatment with p40 increased mucin production in the colonic
      epithelium, thus thickening the mucus layer in the colon of wild type, but not of
      Egfr(wa5) mice, which have a dominant negative mutation in the EGFR kinase
      domain. Furthermore, inhibition of mucin-type O-linked glycosylation suppressed
      the effect of p40 on increasing mucin production and protecting intestinal
      epithelial cells from TNF-induced apoptosis in colon organ culture. Thus, these
      results suggest that p40-stimulated activation of EGFR mediates up-regulation of 
      mucin production, which may contribute to the mechanisms by which p40 protects
      the intestinal epithelium from injury.

TI  - Steps toward harmonization for clinical development of medicines in pediatric
      ulcerative colitis-a global scientific discussion, part 2: data extrapolation,
      trial design, and pharmacokinetics.
PG  - 684-8
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000322 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To facilitate global drug development, the International Pediatric
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease Working Group (i-IBD Working Group) discussed data
      extrapolation, trial design, and pharmacokinetic (PK) considerations for drugs
      intended to treat pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC), and considered possible
      approaches toward harmonized drug development. METHODS: Representatives from the 
      US Food and Drug Administration, European Medicines Agency, Health Canada, and
      the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency of Japan convened monthly to
      explore existing regulatory approaches, reviewed the results of a literature
      search, and provided perspectives on pediatric UC drug development based on the
      available medical literature. RESULTS: Although pediatric UC, when compared with 
      UC in adults, has a similar disease progression and response to intervention, the
      similarity of the exposure-response relation has not been adequately established.
      Consequently, clinical endpoints should be selected to optimally assess efficacy 
      in children. The inclusion of a placebo control in pediatric trials to assure
      assay sensitivity may be appropriate under limited circumstances. In clinical
      studies, although the drug under investigation could provide possible direct
      benefit, placebo treatment should present no more than a minor increase over
      minimal risk to children with UC. CONCLUSIONS: Partial extrapolation of efficacy 
      from informative adult studies may be appropriate. Placebo-controlled efficacy
      trials are scientifically and ethically appropriate for pediatric UC given
      appropriate patient selection and the use of early escape. Clinical studies in
      pediatric UC may include initial dose-finding studies and exposure-response
      modeling followed by an efficacy and safety study to further explore the
      exposure-response relation.

PG  - 679-83
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000306 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: There is a pressing need for drug development in pediatric ulcerative
      colitis (UC). Lack of scientific consensus on efficacy endpoints and disease
      outcome assessments presents a hurdle for global drug development in pediatric
      UC. Scientists from 4 regulatory agencies convened an International Inflammatory 
      Bowel Disease Working Group (i-IBD Working Group) to harmonize present thinking
      about various aspects of drug development in pediatric UC globally. METHODS: The 
      i-IBD Working Group was convened in 2012 by scientists from the US Food and Drug 
      Administration, European Medicines Agency, Health Canada, and the Pharmaceuticals
      and Medical Devices Agency of Japan. The members of this group considered reasons
      for differences in their acceptance of efficacy endpoints and disease activity
      indices used in pediatric UC, reviewed the available literature, and developed
      consensus opinions regarding approaches for evaluating outcomes in pediatric UC
      trials. RESULTS: There is lack of harmonization in using efficacy endpoint and
      outcome assessments including disease activity indices to assess clinical benefit
      in pediatric UC trials. Many disease activity indices have been developed, but
      their biometric properties, such as responsiveness, reliability, and validity,
      have not been properly validated. Biomarkers, such as fecal calprotectin and
      lactoferrin, are being investigated for their potential as noninvasive surrogate 
      endpoints in UC. CONCLUSIONS: Consensus on the efficacy endpoints, disease
      activity indices, and outcome assessments is needed for globalization of
      pediatric UC trials. The i-IBD Working Group offers several perspectives to
      facilitate harmonization across regions. The development of noninvasive
      biomarkers as reliable surrogate endpoints needs to be explored further.

AB  - Deletion of cellular isoform of prion protein (PrP(C)) increases neuronal
      predisposition to damage by modulating apoptosis and the negative consequences of
      oxidative stress. In vivo studies have demonstrated that PrP(C)-deficient mice
      are more prone to seizure, depression, and induction of epilepsy and experience
      extensive cerebral damage following ischemic challenge or viral infection. In
      addition, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of PrP(C) reduces brain damage in
      rat models of cerebral ischemia. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis,
      PrP(C)-deficient mice reportedly have a more aggressive disease onset and less
      clinical improvement during the chronic phase than wild-type mice mice. In mice
      given oral dextran sulfate, PrP(C) has a potential protective role against
      inflammatory bowel disease. PrP(C)-deficient mice demonstrate significantly
      greater increases in blood glucose concentrations after intraperitoneal injection
      of glucose than wild-type mice. Further in vivo challenges to PrP gene-deficient 
      models and conditional knockout models with siRNA and in vivo administration of
      PrP-ligating agents may assist in refining knowledge of the lymphoid function of 
      PrP(C) and predicting the effects of anti-PrP treatment on the immune system.
      Together, these findings indicate that PrP(C) may have multiple neuroprotective
      and anti-inflammatory roles, which explains why this protein is so widely
      expressed.

      antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis in animals and humans.
      Antibiotic-associated diseases may be treated with probiotics, and interest is
      increasing in such uses of probiotics. This study investigated the effect of
      Lactobacillus strains on the quorum-sensing signals and toxin production of C.
      difficile. In addition, an in vivo experiment was designed to assess whether
      Lactobacillus acidophilus GP1B is able to control C. difficile-associated
      disease. Autoinducer-2 activity was measured for C. difficile using the Vibrio
      harveyi coupled bioluminescent assay. Cell extract (10mug/mL) of L. acidophilus
      GP1B exhibited the highest inhibitory activity among 5 to 40mug/mL cell-extract
      concentrations. Real-time PCR data indicated decreased transcriptional levels in 
      luxS, tcdA, tcdB, and txeR genes in the presence of 10mug/mL of cell extract of
      L. acidophilus GP1B. Survival rates at 5d for mice given the pathogen alone with 
      L. acidophilus GP1B cell extract or L. acidophilus GP1B were 10, 70, and 80%,
      respectively. In addition, the lactic acid-produced L. acidophilus GP1B exhibits 
      an inhibitory effect against the growth of C. difficile. Both the L. acidophilus 
      GP1B and GP1B cell extract have significant antipathogenic effects on C.
      difficile.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Osteomalacia is a metabolic bone disorder characterized by impaired
      mineralization of the bone matrix. Vitamin D deficiency due to malabsorption
      syndromes may cause osteomalacia. This is a case of a patient with a 6-year
      history of seronegative spondyloarthropathy associated with Crohn's disease who
      was admitted to our outpatient clinic with symptoms of osteomalacia.
      INTRODUCTION: Osteomalacia is a metabolic bone disease characterized by an
      impaired mineralization of the bone matrix, frequently caused by disorders in
      vitamin D or phosphate metabolism. Vitamin D deficiency due to malabsorption
      syndromes (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, and
      jejuno-ileal bypass for obesity) may cause osteomalacia. CASE REPORT: A
      43-year-old male presented with fatigue, low back pain, and morning stiffness. He
      had a 6-year history of seronegative spondyloarthropathy associated with Crohn's 
      disease. Laboratory findings revealed low serum calcium, low 25-hydroxy vitamin
      D3, normal phosphorus, elevated parathyroid hormone, and alkaline phosphatase
      levels. Radiographs revealed grade IV sacroiliitis and Looser zones. He was
      diagnosed with osteomalacia due to the malabsorption of vitamin D. His symptoms
      and signs were relieved with supplements of vitamin D and calcium. CONCLUSIONS:
      Osteomalacia should be considered in differential diagnosis when assessing low
      back pain in the patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Vitamin D
      deficiency should be treated with vitamin D supplementation in patients with
      Crohn's disease to prevent osteomalacia.

TI  - Treatment of abdominal pain in irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 1193-205
LID - 10.1007/s00535-014-0966-7 [doi]
AB  - Functional abdominal pain in the context of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a
      challenging problem for primary care physicians, gastroenterologists and pain
      specialists. We review the evidence for the current and future
      non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment options targeting the central
      nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. Cognitive interventions such as
      cognitive behavioral therapy and hypnotherapy have demonstrated excellent results
      in IBS patients, but the limited availability and labor-intensive nature limit
      their routine use in daily practice. In patients who are refractory to first-line
      therapy, tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) and selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors are both effective to obtain symptomatic relief, but only TCAs have
      been shown to improve abdominal pain in meta-analyses. A diet low in fermentable 
      carbohydrates and polyols (FODMAP) seems effective in subgroups of patients to
      reduce abdominal pain, bloating, and to improve the stool pattern. The evidence
      for fiber is limited and only isphagula may be somewhat beneficial. The efficacy 
      of probiotics is difficult to interpret since several strains in different
      quantities have been used across studies. Antispasmodics, including peppermint
      oil, are still considered the first-line treatment for abdominal pain in IBS.
      Second-line therapies for diarrhea-predominant IBS include the non-absorbable
      antibiotic rifaximin and the 5HT3 antagonists alosetron and ramosetron, although 
      the use of the former is restricted because of the rare risk of ischemic colitis.
      In laxative-resistant, constipation-predominant IBS, the chloride-secretion
      stimulating drugs lubiprostone and linaclotide, a guanylate cyclase C agonist
      that also has direct analgesic effects, reduce abdominal pain and improve the
      stool pattern.

TI  - Biological agents for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis: a
      systematic review and network meta-analysis.
PG  - 704-11
LID - 10.7326/M13-2403 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biological agents are emerging treatment options for the management
      of ulcerative colitis (UC). PURPOSE: To assess the comparative efficacy and harm 
      of biological agents in adult patients with moderately to severely active UC who 
      are naive to biological agents. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane
      Library from inception through December 2013, without language restrictions, and 
      ClinicalTrials.gov, European Medicines Agency, and U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration Web sites. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized, placebo-controlled or
      head-to-head trials assessing biological agents as induction or maintenance
      therapy for moderately to severely active UC. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers
      independently abstracted study data and outcomes and rated each trial's risk of
      bias. DATA SYNTHESIS: There were no head-to-head trials. There were 7
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that were rated as low risk of bias and
      showed that all biological agents (adalimumab, golimumab, infliximab, and
      vedolizumab) resulted in more clinical responses, clinical remissions, and
      mucosal healings than placebo for induction therapy. The results of network
      meta-analysis suggested that infliximab is more effective to induce clinical
      response (odds ratio, 2.36 [95% credible interval, 1.22 to 4.63]) and mucosal
      healing (odds ratio, 2.02 [95% credible interval, 1.13 to 3.59]) than adalimumab.
      No other indirect comparison reached statistical significance. For maintenance, 6
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that were rated high risk of bias showed 
      that all biological agents have greater clinical efficacy than placebo. The
      occurrence of adverse events was not different between biological agents and
      placebo. LIMITATION: Few trials, no head-to-head comparisons, and inadequate
      follow-up in maintenance trials. CONCLUSION: Biological agents are effective
      treatments for UC, but head-to-head trials are warranted to establish the best
      therapeutic option.

TI  - Intraepithelial lymphocyte eotaxin-2 expression and perineural mast cell
      degranulation differentiate allergic/eosinophilic colitis from classic IBD.
PG  - 300-7
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000432 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Allergic colitis shows overlap with classic inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). Clinically, allergic colitis is associated with dysmotility and
      abdominal pain, and mucosal eosinophilia is characteristic. We thus aimed to
      characterise mucosal changes in children with allergic colitis compared with
      normal tissue and classic IBD, focusing on potential interaction between
      eosinophils and mast cells with enteric neurones. METHODS: A total of 15 children
      with allergic colitis, 10 with Crohn disease (CD), 10 with ulcerative colitis
      (UC), and 10 histologically normal controls were studied. Mucosal biopsies were
      stained for CD3 T cells, Ki-67, eotaxin-1, and eotaxin-2. Eotaxin-2, IgE, and
      tryptase were localised compared with mucosal nerves, using neuronal markers
      neurofilament protein, neuron-specific enolase, and nerve growth factor receptor.
      RESULTS: Overall inflammation was greater in patients with CD and UC than in
      patients with allergic colitis. CD3 T-cell density was increased in patients with
      allergic colitis, similar to that in patients with CD but lower than in patients 
      with UC, whereas eosinophil density was higher than in all other groups.
      Eotaxin-1 and -2 were localised to basolateral crypt epithelium in all specimens,
      with eotaxin-1+ lamina propria cells found in all of the colitis groups.
      Eotaxin-2+ intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) density was significantly higher in
      allergic colitis specimens than in all other groups. Mast cell degranulation was 
      strikingly increased in patients with allergic colitis (12/15) compared with that
      in patients with UC (1/10) and CD (0/1). Tryptase and IgE colocalised on enteric 
      neurons in patients with allergic colitis but rarely in patients with IBD.
      CONCLUSIONS: Eotaxin-2+ IELs may contribute to the periepithelial eosinophil
      accumulation characteristic of allergic colitis. The colocalisation of IgE and
      tryptase with mucosal enteric nerves is likely to promote the dysmotility and
      visceral hyperalgesia classically seen in allergic gastrointestinal inflammation.

      diseases collectively referred to as eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders,
      which includes eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), gastritis, enteritis, and colitis.
      EGE is less common than EoE and involves a different site of disease but
      otherwise shares many common features with EoE. The clinical manifestations of
      EGE are protean and can vary from nausea and vomiting to protein-losing
      enteropathy or even bowel obstruction requiring surgery. Although systemic
      corticosteroids are an effective treatment for EGE, their use results in
      substantial corticosteroid toxicity. Accordingly, there is a great need for
      improved therapies for these patients.

TI  - Faecal metabolite profiling identifies medium-chain fatty acids as discriminating
      compounds in IBD.
PG  - 447-58

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteria play a role in the onset and perpetuation of intestinal
      inflammation in IBD. Compositional alterations may also change the metabolic
      capacities of the gut bacteria. OBJECTIVE: To examine the metabolic activity of
      the microbiota of patients with Crohn's disease (CD), UC or pouchitis compared
      with healthy controls (HC) and determine whether eventual differences might be
      related to the pathogenesis of the disease. METHODS: Faecal samples were obtained
      from 40 HC, 83 patients with CD, 68 with UC and 13 with pouchitis. Disease
      activity was assessed in CD using the Harvey-Bradshaw Index, in UC using the UC
      Disease Activity Index and in pouchitis using the Pouchitis Disease Activity
      Index. Metabolite profiles were analysed using gas chromatography-mass
      spectrometry. RESULTS: The number of metabolites identified in HC (54) was
      significantly higher than in patients with CD (44, p<0.001), UC (47, p=0.042) and
      pouchitis (43, p=0.036). Multivariate discriminant analysis predicted HC, CD, UC 
      and pouchitis group membership with high sensitivity and specificity. The levels 
      of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs: pentanoate, hexanoate, heptanoate, octanoate 
      and nonanoate), and of some protein fermentation metabolites, were significantly 
      decreased in patients with CD, UC and pouchitis. Hexanoate levels were inversely 
      correlated to disease activity in CD (correlation coefficient=-0.157, p=0.046),
      whereas a significant positive correlation was found between styrene levels and
      disease activity in UC (correlation coefficient=0.338, p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS:
      Faecal metabolic profiling in patients with IBD relative to healthy controls
      identified MCFAs as important metabolic biomarkers of disease-related changes.

TI  - PedsQL gastrointestinal symptoms module: feasibility, reliability, and validity.
PG  - 347-55
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000414 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to report on the measurement
      properties of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Gastrointestinal
      Symptoms Module for patients with functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders
      (FGIDs) and organic GI diseases, hereafter referred to as "GI disorders," for
      patient self-report ages between 5 and 18 and parent proxy-report for ages
      between 2 and 18 years. METHODS: The 74-item PedsQL GI Module and 23-item PedsQL 
      Generic Core Scales were completed in a 9-site study by 584 patients and 682
      parents. Patients had physician-diagnosed GI disorders (such as chronic
      constipation, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, functional
      dyspepsia, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease).
      RESULTS: Fourteen unidimensional scales were derived measuring stomach pain,
      stomach discomfort when eating, food and drink limits, trouble swallowing,
      heartburn and reflux, nausea and vomiting, gas and bloating, constipation, blood,
      diarrhea, worry, medicines, and communication. The PedsQL GI Module Scales
      evidenced excellent feasibility, excellent reliability for the Total Scale Scores
      (patient self-report alpha = 0.97, parent proxy-report alpha = 0.97), and
      good-to-excellent reliability for the 14 individual scales (patient self-report
      alpha = 0.67-0.94, parent proxy-report alpha = 0.77-0.95). Intercorrelations with
      the Generic Core Scales supported construct validity. Individual Symptoms Scales 
      known-groups validity across 7 GI disorders was generally supported. Factor
      analysis supported the unidimensionality of the individual scales. CONCLUSIONS:
      The PedsQL GI Module Scales demonstrated acceptable-to-excellent measurement
      properties and may be used as common metrics to compare GI-specific symptoms in
      clinical research and practice both within and across patient groups for FGIDs
      and organic GI diseases.

TI  - Combined probiotic bacteria promotes intestinal epithelial barrier function in

LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i16.4636 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To investigate the protective effects of combinations of probiotic (Bifico) 
      on interleukin (IL)-10-gene-deficient (IL-10 KO) mice and Caco-2 cell monolayers.
      METHODS: IL-10 KO mice were used to assess the benefits of Bifico in vivo. IL-10 
      KO and control mice received approximately 1.5 x 10(8) cfu/d of Bifico for 4 wk. 
      Colons were then removed and analyzed for epithelial barrier function by Ussing
      Chamber, while an ELISA was used to evaluate proinflammatory cytokines. The colon
      epithelial cell line, Caco-2, was used to test the benefit of Bifico in vitro.
      Enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC) and the probiotic mixture Bifico, or
      single probiotic strains, were applied to cultured Caco-2 monolayers. Barrier
      function was determined by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance and
      tight junction protein expression. RESULTS: Treatment of IL-10 KO mice with
      Bifico partially restored body weight, colon length, and epithelial barrier
      integrity to wild-type levels. In addition, IL-10 KO mice receiving Bifico
      treatment had reduced mucosal secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and
      interferon-gamma, and attenuated colonic disease. Moreover, treatment of Caco-2
      monolayers with Bifico or single-strain probiotics in vitro inhibited EIEC
      invasion and reduced the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. CONCLUSION:
      Bifico reduced colon inflammation in IL-10 KO mice, and promoted and improved
      epithelial-barrier function, enhanced resistance to EIEC invasion, and decreased 
      proinflammatory cytokine secretion.

AB  - Accumulating evidence implicates defective innate immunity in the pathogenesis of
      Crohn's disease (CD). Ineffectual NOD2 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain
      2) is the most common susceptibility gene contributing to CD. Vitamin D (vD), a
      potent modulator of innate and adaptive immunity, induces NOD2 gene expression
      and its downstream function. We hypothesized that the hormonal form of vD (1,25D)
      could beneficially modulate innate immune function in CD. Using peripheral
      mononuclear cells and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs) from CD, it was
      found that 1,25D decreased Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced cytokine production
      and enhanced cytokine levels induced by muramyl dipeptide (MDP), the NOD2 ligand.
      1,25D increased the synergistic effect provided by NOD2 and TLR co-activation on 
      interleukin (IL)-10, IL-23, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Whereas 
      1,25D inhibits Mo-DC TLR-induced cytokines, co-stimulation of NOD2 results in
      increased IL-10 and IL-23. IL-12p70 was completely abrogated by 1,25D. 1,25D
      similarly modulated cytokine production by immune cells in ulcerative colitis
      patients and healthy controls. Mo-DCs from CD patients heterozygous for NOD2
      mutations had a response similar to those from patients without NOD2 mutations.
      Immune cells from patients homozygous for the 1007 fs mutation were unresponsive 
      to MDP and 1,25D. Our in vitro data support 1,25D as a potential modulator of
      immunity. However, these results cannot be extrapolated to CD patients without
      further controlled studies.

TI  - Intestinal anti-inflammatory effects of oligosaccharides derived from lactulose
      in the trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid model of rat colitis.
PG  - 4285-97
LID - 10.1021/jf500678p [doi]
AB  - Intestinal microbiota modulation is becoming an interesting approach to manage
      inflammatory bowel disease and can be achieved by the administration of
      prebiotics. Previous studies showed the intestinal anti-inflammatory effects of
      the prebiotic lactulose. The aim of the present study was to test the
      preventative effects of oligosaccharides derived from lactulose with prebiotic
      properties (OsLu) in the trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid model of rat colitis and
      compare them with those of lactulose. Both treatments modified bacterial profile 
      in intestinal contents, increasing the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli counts and
      up-regulating the production of short-chain fatty acids, although OsLu generated 
      a larger amount. OsLu also inhibited to a greater extent different
      pro-inflammatory markers such as interleukins (IL) 1, 6, 12, and 23 and
      chemokines (MCP-1 and CINC-1). However, both prebiotics equally restored colonic 
      epithelial integrity, evaluated both with a histological score (OsLu, 9.8 +/-
      2.2; and lactulose, 12.1 +/- 2.1, vs colitic control, 27.3 +/- 3.3) and by
      measuring several key proteins of the mucosal barrier (MUC-2, MUC-3, and TTF-3). 
      OsLu effect was also associated with an inhibition of iNOS expression and a
      reduction of Th17 cell activity in the inflamed tissue that facilitated the
      intestinal mucosa barrier recovery. In conclusion, OsLu showed a better
      anti-inflammatory profile than lactulose in this model of experimental colitis.

TI  - Nicotinamide treatment ameliorates the course of experimental colitis mediated by
      enhanced neutrophil-specific antibacterial clearance.
PG  - 1474-90
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201300818 [doi]
AB  - SCOPE: In previous studies, we could show that the B vitamin nicotinamide (NAM)
      enhanced antimicrobial activity of neutrophils. Here, we assessed the effects of 
      NAM in two models of experimental colitis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Colitis was
      induced in C57BL/6 mice either by oral infection with Citrobacter rodentium or by
      DSS (dextran sodium sulphate) administration, and animals were systemically
      treated with NAM. Ex vivo bacterial clearance was assessed in murine and human
      whole blood, as well as isolated human neutrophils. In C. rodentium-induced
      colitis, NAM treatment resulted in markedly decreased systemic bacterial
      invasion, histological damage and increased fecal clearance of C. rodentium by up
      to 600-fold. In contrast, NAM had no effect when administered to
      neutrophil-depleted mice. Ex vivo stimulation of isolated human neutrophils, as
      well as murine and human whole blood with NAM led to increased clearance of C.
      rodentium and enhanced expression of antimicrobial peptides in neutrophils.
      Moreover, NAM treatment significantly ameliorated the course of DSS colitis, as
      assessed by body weight, histological damage and myeloperoxidase activity.
      CONCLUSION: Pharmacological application of NAM mediates beneficial effects in
      bacterial and chemically induced colitis. Future studies are needed to explore
      the clinical potential of NAM in the context of intestinal bacterial infections
      and human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

AB  - Although epidemiologic and experimental evidence strongly implicates chronic
      inflammation and dietary fats as risk factors for cancer, the mechanisms
      underlying their contribution to carcinogenesis are poorly understood. Here we
      present genetic evidence demonstrating that deletion of peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARdelta) attenuates colonic inflammation
      and colitis-associated adenoma formation/growth. Importantly, PPARdelta is
      required for dextran sodium sulfate induction of proinflammatory mediators,
      including chemokines, cytokines, COX-2, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), in vivo. We 
      further show that activation of PPARdelta induces COX-2 expression in colonic
      epithelial cells. COX-2-derived PGE2 stimulates macrophages to produce
      proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines that are responsible for recruitment of 
      leukocytes from the circulation to local sites of inflammation. Our results
      suggest that PPARdelta promotes colonic inflammation and colitis-associated tumor
      growth via the COX-2-derived PGE2 signaling axis that mediates cross-talk between
      tumor epithelial cells and macrophages.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although rectal bleeding in infancy (RBI) is not a rare phenomenon,
      the clinical course of RBI is not fully understood. METHODS: To investigate the
      outcome and pathogenesis of RBI, especially when concomitant with
      food-protein-induced proctocolitis (FPIP) and neonatal transient eosinophilic
      colitis (NTEC), 22 neonates with rectal bleeding with FPIP and NTEC from January 
      2008 to June 2012 were enrolled and their clinical course and mechanisms of
      inflammation were examined. RESULTS: Thirteen infants showed rectal bleeding
      after feeding and were diagnosed with FPIP, and nine infants showed rectal
      bleeding before feeding and were diagnosed with NTEC. Elevated peripheral white
      blood cell (12,685 +/- 3754/mul and 30,978 +/- 16,166/mul) and eosinophil (1084
      +/- 816/mul and 4456 +/- 3341/mul) were confirmed in FPIP and NTEC, respectively.
      Colonoscopy revealed nodular lymphoid hyperplasia, a pale mucosal surface and
      oozing with diffuse infiltration of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and eosinophils in 
      both groups. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed
      enhanced expression of the interleukin-6, CCL11, and CXCL13 genes, where CXCL13
      expression was more prominent in FPIP. Mucosal infiltration by CD3- and
      immunoglobulin-A- but not immunoglobulin-E-positive cells was confirmed. Among
      them, only one infant with FPIP developed milk allergy, whereas none with NTEC
      had developed milk allergy at the age of 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: FPIP in infancy and
      NTEC are similar diseases and interleukin-6, CCL11, and CXCL13 may play a major
      role in the pathogenesis of rectal bleeding. Although the involvement of allergic
      reaction is possible, milk allergy was not a common outcome after 1 year of
      follow up.

      delivering in situ IL-10 as a therapy to treat low-grade colon inflammation.
PG  - 1611-21
LID - 10.4161/hv.28549 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a gastrointestinal disorder characterized by
      chronic abdominal pain, discomfort, and bloating. Interestingly, there is now
      evidence of the presence of a low-grade inflammatory status in many IBS patients,
      including histopathological and mucosal cytokine levels in the colon, as well as 
      the presence of IBS-like symptoms in quiescent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 
      The use of a genetically engineered food-grade bacterium, such as Lactococcus
      lactis, secreting the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 has been proven by many
      pre-clinical studies to be a successful therapy to treat colon inflammation. In
      this study, we first reproduced the recovery-recurrence periods observed in
      IBS-patients in a new chronic model characterized by 2 episodes of
      DiNitro-BenzeneSulfonic-acid (DNBS)-challenge and we tested the effects of a
      recombinant strain of L. lactis secreting IL-10 under a Stress-Inducible
      Controlled Expression (SICE) system. In vivo gut permeability, colonic serotonin 
      levels, cytokine profiles, and spleen cell populations were then measured as
      readouts of a low-grade inflammation. In addition, since there is increasing
      evidence that gut microbiota tightly regulates gut barrier function, tight
      junction proteins were also measured by qRT-PCR after administration of
      recombinant L. lactis in DNBS-treated mice. Strikingly, oral administration of L.
      lactis secreting active IL-10 in mice resulted in significant protective effects 
      in terms of permeability, immune activation, and gut-function parameters.
      Although genetically engineered bacteria are, for now, used only as a
      "proof-of-concept," our study validates the interest in the use of the novel SICE
      system in L. lactis to express therapeutic molecules, such as IL-10, locally at
      mucosal surfaces.

TI  - Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin in blood in children with inflammatory
      bowel disease.
PG  - 1883-9
LID - 10.1111/jgh.12597 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a 25 kDa
      glycoprotein present in the bodily fluids and tissues. It is secreted by
      neutrophils, epithelial cells, hepatocytes and adipocytes, and its expression is 
      highly increased in response to cellular stress. The role of NGAL in the
      pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease including Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis in children has thus far not been studied. METHODS: The
      following groups of children were included: (i) inflammatory bowel disease group,
      n = 36, aged from 1 to 18 years with Crohn's disease (n = 19) and ulcerative
      colitis (n = 17); (ii) control group, n = 126; and (iii) disease control group, n
      = 27, without inflammatory bowel disease, with a food and/or inhalant allergy.
      RESULTS: Healthy children aged from 1 to 8 years exhibited lower NGAL level than 
      those of 9 to 18 years old (39.0; 18.1-83.7 ng/mL vs 57.6; 28.7-107 ng/mL, P =
      0.001). In the younger, but not in the older children, the serum NGAL level
      correlated with their age, r = 0.334, P = 0.001. In children with inflammatory
      bowel disease, serum NGAL level was higher (108; 37.3-245 ng/mL) than in healthy 
      (42.0; 18.1-107 ng/mL) and allergic, noninflammatory bowel disease children
      (49.3; 19.3-107 ng/mL), P = 0.001. Serum NGAL levels in Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis children did not correlate with age, gender, disease activity,
      and indices of the inflammation. CONCLUSION: Serum NAGL levels are highly
      elevated in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in children compared to the
      healthy control group. Systematic studies are needed to explain the role of this 
      protein in the inflammatory bowel disease.

AB  - Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) are important food-borne pathogens 
      associated with cases of diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic
      syndrome (HUS). E. coli O157:H7 is the dominant serotype in Argentina and also in
      Neuquen Province, in which HUS incidence is above the national average, with a
      maximum of 28.6 cases per 100,000 children less than 5 years old reported in
      1998. The aim of this study was to characterize a collection of 70 STEC O157
      strains isolated from patients with diarrhea and HUS treated in the province of
      Neuquen, Argentina, between 1998 and 2011. All strains harbored eae, ehxA,
      rfbO157, and fliCH7 genes, and stx2a/stx2c (78.7%) was the predominant genotype. 
      A total of 64 (91.4%) STEC O157 strains belonged to the hypervirulent clade 8
      tested using both 4 and 32 SNP typing schemes. The strains showed the highest
      values reported in the literature for 6 of the 7 virulence determinants described
      in the TW14359 O157 strain associated with the raw spinach outbreak in the U.S.
      in 2006. Clade 8 strains were strongly associated with two of them: ECSP_3286,
      factor encoding an outer membrane protein that facilitates the transport of the
      heme complex (P=0.001), and in particular extracellular factor ECSP_2870/2872,
      coding proteins related to adaptation to plant hosts (P=0.000004). The q933
      allele, which has been related to high toxin production, was present in 97.1% of 
      the strains studied for the anti-terminator Q gene. In summary, this study
      describes, for the first time in Argentina, the almost exclusive circulation of
      strains belonging to the hypervirulent clade 8, and also the presence of putative
      virulence factors in higher frequencies than those reported worldwide. These data
      may help to understand the causes of the particular epidemiological situation
      related to HUS in Neuquen Province.

PG  - 570-1
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2014.34 [doi]
AB  - Based on the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS),
      the FDA and Hoffman La Roche issued warnings of a possible causal association
      between isotretinoin and inflammatory bowel disease. While scientists studied the
      association, trial lawyers used the courts to award large sums of money to
      plaintiffs despite the absence of clear scientific evidence of a causal effect.
      In this Issue of the Journal, a well-designed, large pharmaco-epidemiologic study
      shows no association. The story of isotretinoin highlights the problems that
      occur when the FAERS is used in litigation prior to further study and scientific 
      analysis.

TI  - Selenium and selenoproteins in inflammatory bowel diseases and experimental
      colitis.
PG  - 1110-9
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000020 [doi]
AB  - Inadequate dietary intake of the essential trace element selenium (Se) is thought
      to be a risk factor for several chronic diseases associated with oxidative stress
      and inflammation. Biological actions of Se occur through low-molecular weight
      metabolites and through selenoproteins. Several key selenoproteins including
      glutathione peroxidases; selenoproteins M, P, and S; and selenium-binding protein
      1 have been detected in the intestine. Interestingly, Se and antioxidant
      selenoproteins are known to modulate differentiation and function of immune cells
      and contribute to avoid excessive immune responses. This review discusses the
      role of Se and intestinal selenoproteins in inflammatory bowel diseases, based on
      data from human, animal, and in vitro studies. In humans, Se deficiency is
      commonly observed in patients with Crohn's disease. In animal models of
      experimental colitis, the Se status was negatively correlated with the severity
      of the disease. While the cause-effect relationship of these observations remains
      to be clarified, the beneficial outcome of dietary Se supplementation and an
      optimization of selenoprotein biosynthesis in murine inflammatory bowel disease
      models have led to investigations of targets and actions of Se in the
      gastrointestinal tract. The Se status affects gene expression, signaling
      pathways, and cellular functions in the small and large intestine as well as the 
      gut microbiome composition. This data, particularly from animal experiments, hold
      promise that adequate dietary Se supply may counteract chronic intestinal
      inflammation in humans.

TI  - Saccharomyces cerevisiae fungemia, a possible consequence of the treatment of
      Clostridium difficile colitis with a probioticum.
PG  - 143-6
AB  - The yeast Saccharomyces boulardii is a biotherapeutic agent used for the
      prevention and treatment of several gastrointestinal diseases, such as diarrhoea 
      caused by Clostridium difficile, in addition to the antibiotic therapy. In this
      study we report a case of Saccharomyces cerevisiae fungemia in a patient with
      Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD) treated orally with S.
      boulardii in association with vancomycin. The identification of the S. cerevisiae
      was confirmed by molecular technique. Fungemia is a rare, but a serious
      complication to treatment with probiotics. We believe it is important to remind
      the clinicians of this risk when prescribing probiotics, especially to
      immunocompromised patients.

AB  - Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is an emerging disorder characterized by
      intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms related to the ingestion of
      gluten-containing food in non-celiac patients. Its prevalence has been estimated 
      to be six to ten-times higher than that of celiac disease (CD). A gluten-free
      diet is the most widely recommended therapy, but the causative agent remains
      unknown and there are no consensus diagnostic criteria. Recent studies on NCGS
      have included patients with possibly overlooked minor CD and diarrhea-predominant
      irritable bowel syndrome without self-reported gluten intolerance, but showing a 
      response to a gluten-free diet. Furthermore, FODMAPs (Fermentable
      Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides And Polyols) have recently been 
      postulated as the culprit component for NCGS in wheat, instead of gluten. This
      review updates evidence on the pathophysiology of NCGS and the efficacy of
      different dietary interventions in its treatment, stressing the need for proper
      screening for CD before a diagnosis of NCGS is made.

LID - 10.4161/gmic.28622 [doi]
AB  - Under conventional conditions, mice deficient in core 1-derived O-glycans (TM-IEC
      C1galt1(-/-)), which have a defective mucus layer, experienced spontaneous
      inflammation of the colon. Analysis of fecal bacterial populations by
      pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene showed that disease in conventional TM-IEC
      C1galt1(-/-) was associated with shifts in the microbiota manifested by increases
      in Lactobacillus and Clostridium species, and decreases in unclassified
      Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae. Under germ-free (GF) conditions, TM-IEC
      C1galt1(-/-) presented decreased goblet cells, but did not develop inflammation. 
      Monoassociation of GF TM-IEC C1galt1(-/-) revealed that bacterial species differ 
      significantly in their ability to induce inflammatory changes. Bacteroides
      thetaiotaomicron caused inflammation, while Lactobacillus johnsonii (enriched
      during colitis) did not. These observations demonstrate that not all microbiota
      shifts that correlate with disease contribute to pathogenesis.

AB  - The gut microbiota plays important roles in the development of the host immune
      system. We have previously shown that a combination of 46 strains of commensal
      Clostridia isolated from conventionally reared mice can induce the accumulation
      of CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells in the mouse colonic lamina propria. 
      Subsequently, we succeeded in isolating and selecting 17 strains of Clostridia
      from a healthy human fecal sample that can significantly increase the number and 
      function of colonic Treg cells in colonized rodents, thereby attenuating symptoms
      of experimental allergic diarrhea and colitis. Here we characterize each of the
      17 strains of human-derived Clostridia in terms of sensitivity to antibiotics and
      ability to produce short chain fatty acids and other metabolites, and discuss
      their potential as biotherapeutics to correct dysbiosis and treat
      immune-inflammatory diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: The adhesion molecule expression and matrix
      metalloproteinases (MMPs) are proposed to be major factors for intestinal injury 
      mediated by T cells in (IBD) and are up-regulated in intestinal mucosa of IBD
      patients. To investigate the effect of vitamin D derivatives on adhesion
      molecules and MMPs in colonic biopsies of IBD patients. METHODS: Biopsies from
      inflamed and non-inflamed tract of terminal ileum and colon and PBMC from the
      same IBD patients were cultured with or without vitamin D derivatives. MMP
      activity and adhesion molecule levels were determined. RESULTS: 1,25(OH)2D3 and
      ZK 191784 significantly decrease ICAM-1 protein levels in the biopsies obtained
      only from the inflamed region of intestine of UC patients, while MAdCAM-1 levels 
      decrease in the presence of 1,25(OH)2D3 in the non-inflamed region, and, in the
      presence of ZK, in the inflamed one. In CD patients 1,25(OH)2D3 and ZK decrease
      ICAM-1 and MAdCAM-1 in the biopsies obtained from the non-inflamed and inflamed
      regions, with the exception of ICAM-1 in the inflamed region in the presence of
      1,25(OH)2D3. The expression of MMP-9, MMP-2, and MMP-3 decreases in the presence 
      of vitamin D derivatives in UC and CD with the exception of 1,25(OH)2D3 that does
      not affect the levels of MMP-9 and MMP-2 in CD. Vitamin D derivatives always
      affect MMP-9, MMP-2 and ICAM-1 in PBMC of UC and CD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Based 
      on the increased expression of ICAM-1, MAdCAM-1 and MMP-2,-9,-3 in IBD, our study
      suggests that vitamin D derivatives may be effective in the management of these
      diseases.

AB  - To achieve immune homeostasis in such a harsh environment as the intestinal
      mucosa, both active and quiescent immunity operate simultaneously. Disruption of 
      gut immune homeostasis leads to the development of intestinal immune diseases
      such as colitis and food allergies. Among various intestinal innate immune cells,
      mast cells (MCs) play critical roles in protective immunity against pathogenic
      microorganisms, especially at mucosal sites. This suggests the potential for a
      novel MC-targeting type of vaccine adjuvant. Dysregulated activation of MCs also 
      results in inflammatory responses in mucosal compartments. The regulation of this
      yin and yang function of MCs remains to be elucidated. In this review, we focus
      on the roles of mucosal MCs in the regulation of intestinal allergic reaction,
      inflammation and their potential as a new target for the development of mucosal
      adjuvants.

      ameliorates dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis in mice.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) severely affects the quality of life of
      patients. At present, there is no clinical solution for this condition;
      therefore, there is a need for innovative therapies for IBD. Hepatocyte growth
      factor (HGF) exerts various biological activities in various organs. However, a
      clinically applicable and effective HGF-based therapy for IBD has yet to be
      developed. In this study, we examined the therapeutic effect of injecting an
      adenoviral vector encoding the human HGF gene (Ad.HGF) into the hindlimbs of mice
      with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. Plasma levels of circulating
      human HGF (hHGF) were measured in injected mice. The results showed that weight
      loss and colon shortening were significantly lower in Ad.HGF-infected mice as
      compared to control (Ad.LacZ-infected) colitic mice. Additionally, inflammation
      and crypt scores were significantly reduced in the entire length of the colon,
      particularly in the distal section. This therapeutic effect was associated with
      increased cell proliferation and an antiapoptotic effect, as well as a reduction 
      in the number of CD4+ cells and a decreased CD4/CD8 ratio. The levels of
      inflammatory, as well as Th1 and Th2 cytokines were higher in Ad.HGF-infected
      mice as compared to the control colitic mice. Thus, systemically circulating hHGF
      protein, produced by an adenovirally transduced hHGF gene introduced at distal
      sites in the limbs, significantly ameliorated DSS-induced colitis by promoting
      cell proliferation (i.e., regeneration), preventing apoptosis, and
      immunomodulation. Owing to its clinical feasibility and potent therapeutic
      effects, this method may be developed into a clinical therapy for treating IBD.

AB  - Escherichia coli O157, a foodborne pathogen of major concern for public health,
      has been associated with numerous outbreaks of haemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic
      uremic syndrome worldwide. Human infection with E. coli O157 has been primarily
      associated with the food-chain transmission route. This transmission route
      commonly elicits a multi-faceted adaptive stress response of E. coli O157 for an 
      extended period of time prior to human infection. Several recent research
      articles have indicated that E. coli O157:H7 has evolved unique survival
      characteristics which can affect the epidemiology and ecology of this zoonotic
      pathogen. This review article summarizes the recent knowledge of the molecular
      responses of E. coli O157 to the most common stressors found within the human
      food chain, and further emphasizes the influence of these stressors on the
      epidemiology and ecology of E. coli O157.

TI  - Development of a self-efficacy scale for adolescents and young adults with
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 29-32
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000357 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) self-management fits well 
      within a social-cognitive framework. At the heart of social-cognitive theory is
      self-efficacy, a set of beliefs about one's ability to perform certain tasks.
      Self-efficacy is a strong predictor of health outcomes in chronic diseases and
      could serve as an intermediary outcome measure of self-management for pediatric
      IBD. The aim of this preliminary study was to develop items for the design of a
      self-efficacy scale specifically for adolescents and young adults with IBD.
      METHODS: Survey development is an iterative process. As defined by the US Food
      and Drug Administration guidelines for developing a patient-reported outcome
      measurement, the first step of this process is to obtain patient input. Using
      qualitative research methods, adolescents and young adults were recruited from an
      outpatient pediatric gastroenterology clinic to participate in a semistructured
      interview. Transcriptions of the recorded interviews were reviewed for themes
      related to self-efficacy around disease management. A consensus panel of
      gastroenterologists and health psychologists reviewed the initially constructed
      items. Those specific items were then reviewed and adjusted by a panel of
      participants for content and understandability using cognitive interview methods.
      The resulting 13-item scale is presented here. RESULTS: Nineteen patients and 5
      parents participated in the study. The study sample was 42% girls, 79% whites,
      74% had Crohn disease, and 79% had not required surgery. Median age was 15 years 
      (range 10-22 years). Theme analysis and expert review yielded 13 items across 4
      theoretical domains: managing medical care, managing daily life with IBD,
      managing emotions, and managing the future with IBD. CONCLUSIONS: A 13-item
      disease-specific scale has been developed based on patient input to assess
      self-efficacy around self-management in adolescents with IBD. Efforts to validate
      this newly designed scale are presently under way.

TI  - Colonic expression of the peptide transporter PEPT1 is downregulated during
      intestinal inflammation and is not required for NOD2-dependent immune activation.
PG  - 671-84
LID - 10.1097/01.MIB.0000443336.71488.08 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: PEPT1 was proposed to be expressed only in inflamed colonic tissues
      in which it could contribute to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) development by
      transporting bacterial peptides, such as muramyl dipeptide (MDP), that activate
      intracellular pattern recognition receptors, such as the nucleotide-binding and
      oligomerization domain 2. To better define the pathological relevance of this
      transporter, we analyzed PEPT1 expression during intestinal inflammation and
      studied the susceptibility of Pept1-deficient (Pept1) mice to experimental
      colitis. METHODS: Wild-type and Pept1 mice were treated with dextran sulfate
      sodium and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid to induce colitis, and MDP-induced
      cytokine expression was studied in colonic tissue cultures. PEPT1 expression was 
      characterized in mouse models of Crohn's disease-like ileitis (Tnf) or colitis
      (Il-10, Il-10XTlr2) and endoscopic tissue samples from descending colon of
      patients with IBD (n = 11) and controls (n = 17). Moreover, the prevalence of the
      PEPT1 single-nucleotide polymorphism rs2297322 was tested in German patients with
      IBD (n = 458) and controls (n = 452). RESULTS: PEPT1 expression was consistently 
      reduced under condition of acute or chronic experimental inflammation. Wild-type 
      and Pept1 mice revealed comparable susceptibility to dextran sulfate
      sodium-induced and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis, and
      MDP-induced cytokine expression was PEPT1-independent. PEPT1 expression levels
      were also decreased in descending colon of patients with IBD during acute
      inflammation, but the rs2297322 single-nucleotide polymorphism was not associated
      with IBD susceptibility in the German cohort. CONCLUSIONS: PEPT1 expression is
      reduced during intestinal inflammation and PEPT1 is neither required for
      MDP-induced immune response nor is the PEPT1 rs2297322 single-nucleotide
      polymorphism associated with IBD susceptibility in our German cohort. These data 
      strongly argue against a primary role of PEPT1 in the initiation or progression
      of IBD.

AB  - Multiple locus variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) analysis (MLVA) has become 
      a reliable tool, able to establish genetic relationships for epidemiological
      surveillance and molecular subtyping of pathogens such as verotoxigenic
      Escherichia coli (VTEC). This emerging pathogen whose primary reservoir is the
      cattle causes severe disease in humans, such as hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic
      uremic syndrome. With the aim of comparing a recently proposed MLVA assay with
      that used routinely in our laboratory, we analyzed a set of VTEC isolates (n =
      72) obtained from meat using both assays. All samples could be typed by the new
      MLVA assay, and an increase in the number of distinct profiles (31-43) was
      observed. However, intraserotype resolution was not significantly enhanced; thus,
      the incorporation of more VNTR loci is still needed to achieve a greater
      discrimination among non-O157:H7 serotypes.

AB  - The evolving understanding of the role of the microbiome and environmental

      interesting and potentially powerful tool in the treatment of disease. However,
      at this time, evidence is limited but anecdotal reports of success abound. There 
      is a bewildering array of new diets being tried by patients in an attempt to
      control diseases. This review attempts to summarize the most common diets for the
      treating physician.

AB  - Studies of the roles of microbial communities in the development of inflammatory 
      bowel disease (IBD) have reached an important milestone. A decade of genome-wide 
      association studies and other genetic analyses have linked IBD with loci that
      implicate an aberrant immune response to the intestinal microbiota. More
      recently, profiling studies of the intestinal microbiome have associated the
      pathogenesis of IBD with characteristic shifts in the composition of the
      intestinal microbiota, reinforcing the view that IBD results from altered
      interactions between intestinal microbes and the mucosal immune system. Enhanced 
      technologies can increase our understanding of the interactions between the host 
      and its resident microbiota and their respective roles in IBD from both a
      large-scale pathway view and at the metabolic level. We review important
      microbiome studies of patients with IBD and describe what we have learned about
      the mechanisms of intestinal microbiota dysfunction. We describe the recent
      progress in microbiome research from exploratory 16S-based studies, reporting
      associations of specific organisms with a disease, to more recent studies that
      have taken a more nuanced view, addressing the function of the microbiota by
      metagenomic and metabolomic methods. Finally, we propose study designs and
      methodologies for future investigations of the microbiome in patients with
      inflammatory gut and autoimmune diseases in general.

TI  - Restriction of dairy products; a reality in inflammatory bowel disease patients.
PG  - 575-81
LID - 10.3305/nh.2014.29.3.7124 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Calcium deficiency is considered a risk factor for the development 
      of osteoporosis in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Various dietary
      restrictions, including milk products are reported by these patients. OBJECTIVE: 
      To evaluate dairy product and dietary calcium intake by IBD patients. METHODS:
      This cross-sectional study enrolled 65 outpatients with IBD recruited from one
      reference center for IBD. A semi-structured questionnaire (to collect
      demographic, socioeconomic and clinical data) and a quantitative food frequency
      questionnaire were administered. With regard to clinical data, we evaluated the
      anthropometric nutritional status, the disease classification, the disease
      activity index and the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Self-reported
      modifications in the use of dairy products were evaluated. RESULTS: The IBD
      patients' ages ranged from 20-75 years and 67.0% were diagnosed with ulcerative
      colitis. The majority (64.7%) reported restricting dairy products. The frequency 
      of gastrointestinal symptoms was higher among the Crohn's disease patients who
      restricted dairy products than among those with no restrictions (100% vs 42.9%; p
      = 0.013); this result was not observed among the UC (ulcerative colitis)
      patients. Disease activity was also more frequent in the IBD patients who
      restricted dairy products than in those with no restrictions (23.8% vs 4.5%; p = 
      0.031), and among the UC patients, extensive disease was more common in the
      patients who restricted dairy products than in those with no restrictions (42.9% 
      vs 20.0%; p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Restricting dairy products is common among IBD
      patients, possibly due to disease activity, the presence of gastrointestinal
      symptoms and the extension of the disease.

AB  - The global prevalence of Fe deficiency is high and a common corrective strategy
      is oral Fe supplementation, which may affect the commensal gut microbiota and
      gastrointestinal health. The aim of the present study was to investigate the
      impact of different dietary Fe concentrations on the gut microbiota and gut
      health of rats inoculated with human faecal microbiota. Rats (8 weeks old, n 40) 
      were divided into five (n 8 each) groups and fed diets differing only in Fe
      concentration during an Fe-depletion period (12 weeks) and an Fe-repletion period
      (4 weeks) as follows: (1) Fe-sufficient diet throughout the study period; (2)
      Fe-sufficient diet followed by 70 mg Fe/kg diet; (3) Fe-depleted diet throughout 
      the study period; (4) Fe-depleted diet followed by 35 mg Fe/kg diet; (5)
      Fe-depleted diet followed by 70 mg Fe/kg diet. Faecal and caecal samples were
      analysed for gut microbiota composition (quantitative PCR and pyrosequencing) and
      bacterial metabolites (HPLC), and intestinal tissue samples were investigated
      histologically. Fe depletion did not significantly alter dominant populations of 
      the gut microbiota and did not induce Fe-deficiency anaemia in the studied rats. 
      Provision of the 35 mg Fe/kg diet after feeding an Fe-deficient diet
      significantly increased the abundance of dominant bacterial groups such as
      Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium cluster IV members compared with that of an
      Fe-deficient diet. Fe supplementation increased gut microbial butyrate
      concentration 6-fold compared with Fe depletion and did not affect histological
      colitis scores. The present results suggest that Fe supplementation enhances the 
      concentration of beneficial gut microbiota metabolites and thus may contribute to
      gut health.

AB  - Oligosaccharides represent a significant fraction of breast milk, reaching up to 
      20 g/l in early milk. Human milk oligosaccharides comprise close to 200
      structures, which are not absorbed by the intestinal tissue and have no
      nutritional value for the breastfed infant. Early studies conducted around 1930
      already attributed a prebiotic activity to milk oligosaccharides by showing their
      stimulatory effects on the growth of specific intestinal microbiota. In addition,
      milk oligosaccharides contribute to the defence against enteric pathogens by
      acting as soluble decoys preventing the adhesion of viruses and bacteria to their
      carbohydrate mucosal receptors. The structural complexity of milk
      oligosaccharides hampers the assignment of specific functions to single
      carbohydrates. The application of mouse models allows the investigation of unique
      milk oligosaccharides in the context of intestinal microbiota and mucosal
      immunity. In this respect, our recent work has demonstrated that uptake of the
      milk oligosaccharide 3-sialyllactose increases the inflammatory response observed
      in different colitis models. The proinflammatory action of 3-sialyllactose was
      attributed on the one hand to the modulation of intestinal bacterial groups, and 
      on the other hand to a direct stimulatory effect on CD11c+ dendritic cells. The
      availability of pure oligosaccharides in large amounts will soon enable the study
      of these compounds in humans in the context of intestinal and metabolic disorders
      associated to various forms of dysbiosis.

AB  - The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is moving from the Crohn's Disease
      Activity Index to patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and objective measures of
      disease, such as findings from endoscopy. PROs will become an important aspect of
      assessing activity of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and for labeling specific 
      drugs for this disease. PROs always have been considered in the management of
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis, and have included
      measurements of quality of life, disability, or fatigue. Several disease-specific
      scales have been developed to assess these PROs and commonly are used in clinical
      trials. Outcomes reported by patients in clinical trials of IBD initially focused
      on quality of life, measured by the Short-Form 36 questionnaire or
      disease-specific scales such as the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire or
      its shorter version. Recently considered factors include fatigue, depression and 
      anxiety, and work productivity, as measured by the Functional Assessment Chronic 
      Illness Therapy-Fatigue, the Hospital Anxiety Depression, and the Work
      Productivity Activity Impairment Questionnaire, respectively. However, few data
      are available on how treatment affects these factors in patients with IBD.
      Although disability generally is recognized in patients with IBD, it is not
      measured. The international IBD disability index currently is being validated.
      None of the PROs currently used in IBD were developed according to FDA guidance
      for PRO development. PROs will be a major primary end point of future trials. FDA
      guidance is needed to develop additional PROs for IBD that can be incorporated
      into trials, to better compare patients' experience with different therapies.

TI  - Lactobacillus paracasei CBA L74 metabolic products and fermented milk for infant 
      formula have anti-inflammatory activity on dendritic cells in vitro and
      protective effects against colitis and an enteric pathogen in vivo.

AB  - The rapid expansion of commercially available fermented food products raises
      important safety issues particularly when infant food is concerned. In many
      cases, the activity of the microorganisms used for fermentation as well as what
      will be the immunological outcome of fermented food intake is not known. In this 
      manuscript we used complex in vitro, ex-vivo and in vivo systems to study the
      immunomodulatory properties of probiotic-fermented products (culture supernatant 
      and fermented milk without live bacteria to be used in infant formula). We found 
      in vitro and ex-vivo that fermented products of Lactobacillus paracasei CBA L74
      act via the inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine release leaving
      anti-inflammatory cytokines either unaffected or even increased in response to
      Salmonella typhimurium. These activities are not dependent on the inactivated
      bacteria but to metabolic products released during the fermentation process. We
      also show that our in vitro systems are predictive of an in vivo efficacy by the 
      fermented products. Indeed CBA L74 fermented products (both culture medium and
      fermented milk) could protect against colitis and against an enteric pathogen
      infection (Salmonella typhimurium). Hence we found that fermented products can
      act via the inhibition of immune cell inflammation and can protect the host from 
      pathobionts and enteric pathogens. These results open new perspectives in infant 
      nutrition and suggest that L. paracasei CBA L74 fermented formula can provide
      immune benefits to formula-fed infants, without carrying live bacteria that may
      be potentially dangerous to an immature infant immune system.

TI  - Identification of a probiotic bacteria-derived activator of the aryl hydrocarbon 
      receptor that inhibits colitis.
PG  - 460-5
LID - 10.1038/icb.2014.2 [doi]
AB  - The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) recognizes environmental xenobiotics and is
      originally thought to be involved in the metabolism (detoxification) of the
      substances. Recently, AhR is highlighted as an important regulator of
      inflammation. Notably, accumulating evidence suggests that activation of the AhR 
      suppresses inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Therefore, non-toxic AhR
      activators become attractive drug candidates for IBD. This study identified
      1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (DHNA), a precursor of menaquinone (vitamin K2)
      abundantly produced by Propionibacterium freudenreichii ET-3 isolated from
      Swiss-type cheese, as an AhR activator. DHNA activated the AhR pathway in human
      intestinal epithelial cell line Caco2 cells and in the mouse intestine. Oral
      treatment of mice with DHNA induced anti-microbial proteins RegIIIbeta and gamma 
      in the intestine, altered intestinal microbial flora and inhibited dextran sodium
      sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis, which recapitulated the phenotypes of AhR
      activation in the gut. As DHNA is commercially available in Japan as a prebiotic 
      supplement without severe adverse effects, DHNA or its derivatives might become a
      promising drug candidate for IBD via AhR activation. The results also implicate
      that intestinal AhR might act not only as a sensor for xenobiotics in diet and
      water but also for commensal bacterial activity because DHNA is a precursor of
      vitamin K2 produced by vitamin K2-synthesizing commensal bacteria as well as
      propionic bacteria. Hence, DHNA might be a key bacterial metabolite in the
      host-microbe interaction to maintain intestinal microbial ecosystem.

AB  - This study was conducted to investigate serum amino acids profile in dextran
      sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, and impacts of graded dose of arginine or
      glutamine supplementation on the colitis. Using DSS-induced colitis model, which 
      is similar to human ulcerative colitis, we determined serum profile of amino
      acids at day 3, 7, 10 and 12 (5 days post DSS treatment). Meanwhile, effects of
      graded dose of arginine (0.4%, 0.8%, and 1.5%) or glutamine (0.5%, 1.0% and 2.0%)
      supplementation on clinical parameters, serum amino acids, colonic tight junction
      proteins, colonic anti-oxidative indicators [catalase, total superoxide dismutase
      (T-SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px)], colonic pro-inflammatory cytokines
      [interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, IL-17 and tumor necrosis factor alpha
      (TNF-alpha)] in DSS-induced colitis were fully analyzed at day 7 and 12.
      Additionally, the activation of signal transduction pathways, including nuclear
      factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK),
      phosphoinositide-3-kinases (PI3K)/PI3K-protein kinase B (Akt), and myosin light
      chain kinase (MLCK)-myosin light chain (MLC20), were analyzed using
      immunoblotting. Serum amino acids analysis showed that DSS treatment changed the 
      serum contents of amino acids, such as Trp, Glu, and Gln (P<0.05). Dietary
      arginine or glutamine supplementation had significant (P<0.05) influence on the
      clinical and biochemical parameters (T-SOD, IL-17 and TNF-alpha) in colitis
      model. These results were associated with colonic NF-kappaB, PI3K-Akt and MLCK
      signaling pathways. In conclusion, arginine or glutamine could be a potential
      therapy for intestinal inflammatory diseases.

      affect the inflammasome in intestinal epithelial cells.
PG  - 110-8
LID - 10.1159/000357521 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The probiotic bacterial strain Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) is 
      used for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC), diarrhea and constipation. Its
      beneficial effects in the treatment of UC have been demonstrated in several
      controlled clinical studies; however, the mechanism of action on the cellular
      level is still not completely clear. The intracellular pattern recognition
      receptor NLRP3 is expressed in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC), activates
      caspase-1 within the inflammasome complex and has been implicated to play a role 
      in the etiology of inflammatory bowel diseases. METHODS: Probiotic EcN and
      commensal E. coli K12 were applied to IEC in vitro. Inflammasome activation,
      interleukin (IL)-18 release and caspase-1 activation were determined by
      coimmunoprecipitation, Western blot and ELISA. Apoptosis was investigated by
      Western blot. RESULTS: Incubation of Caco-2 cells with EcN resulted in lower
      inflammasome activation and subsequent secretion of mature IL-18 as compared to
      the commensal strain K12. Induction of apoptosis as determined by cleavage of
      caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase were lower in EcN-stimulated cells.
      Autophagy was induced by both bacterial strains, but to a higher extent by K12.
      CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that genetically very similar E. coli strains
      differ markedly in their ability to activate the inflammasome.

      is a major cause of morbidity and increased health care costs. C difficile
      infection follows disruption of the indigenous gut microbiota by antibiotics.
      Antibiotics create an environment within the intestine that promotes C difficile 
      spore germination, vegetative growth, and toxin production, leading to epithelial
      damage and colitis. Studies of patients with C difficile infection and animal
      models have shown that the indigenous microbiota can inhibit expansion and
      persistence of C difficile. Although the specific mechanisms of these processes
      are not known, they are likely to interfere with key aspects of the pathogen's
      physiology, including spore germination and competitive growth. Increasing our
      understanding of how the intestinal microbiota manage C difficile could lead to
      better means of controlling this important nosocomial pathogen.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Inorganic nitrate and nitrite have emerged as alternative substrates 
      for nitric oxide (NO) generation in the gastrointestinal tract, and have shown to
      be protective against drug-induced gastric injury. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the preventive and therapeutic effects of nitrate and nitrite in a
      model of experimental colitis. METHODS: Colitis was induced in mice by
      administrating dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) with concurrent administration of
      nitrite (1 mM) or nitrate (10 mM) in the drinking water for 7 days. A therapeutic
      approach was also investigated by initiating nitrite treatment 3 days after
      DSS-induced colitis. Clinical and inflammatory markers were assessed and the
      colonic mucus thickness was measured in vivo. The effect of nitrite on wound
      healing was evaluated using colon epithelial cells. RESULTS: Concurrent
      administration of DSS and nitrite (1 mM) alleviated inflammation as determined by
      reduced disease activity index score (DAI) and increased colon length, while
      nitrate (10 mM) only reduced the DAI-score. Nitrite also displayed therapeutic
      effects by ameliorating established colonic inflammation with reduced colonic
      expression of iNOS and improving histopathology. DSS-induced decrease in colonic 
      mucus thickness was completely prevented by nitrite administration. In addition, 
      goblet cell abundance was lower by DSS treatment, but was increased by addition
      of nitrite. Further studies using colon epithelial cells revealed an NO-dependent
      improvement in wound healing with nitrite administration. CONCLUSION: Nitrite
      exerts both preventive and therapeutic effects in colonic inflammation. The
      protective effects involve preservation of an intact adherent mucus layer and
      regulation of epithelial cell restitution.

TI  - Probiotic treatments for induction and maintenance of remission in inflammatory
      bowel diseases: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
PG  - 1-13
LID - 10.1007/s12328-013-0440-8 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics have been used for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).
      However, the effects of probiotics on the induction and maintenance of remission 
      in ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) still remain controversial.
      This systematic review verified the findings of high-quality randomized
      controlled trials (RCTs) which investigated the therapeutic effects of probiotics
      on IBD. After the quality assessment, 20 RCTs which investigated the effects of
      probiotics on the induction or maintenance of remission in IBD were identified.
      From the results of the validation of these RCTs, beneficial effects of probiotic
      treatments to improve the response rate and remission rate on the remission
      induction therapies [risk ratio (RR) 1.81; 95 % confidence interval (CI)
      1.40-2.35 and RR 1.56; 95 % CI 0.95-2.56, respectively] were verified.
      Furthermore, probiotic treatments exhibited effects equal to mesalazine on the
      maintenance of remission in UC (RR 1.00; 95 % CI 0.79-1.26). In contrast, no
      significant effect of probiotic treatments was shown in either the induction or
      maintenance of remission in CD. Because there were many variations in the
      conditions among these studies, a further analysis evaluating the effects of
      probiotic treatments in IBD is needed to clarify the optimal probiotics and
      treatment regimens for each condition or population in IBD patients.

TI  - Advantages and pitfalls in the application of mixed-model association methods.
PG  - 100-6
LID - 10.1038/ng.2876 [doi]
AB  - Mixed linear models are emerging as a method of choice for conducting genetic
      association studies in humans and other organisms. The advantages of the
      mixed-linear-model association (MLMA) method include the prevention of false
      positive associations due to population or relatedness structure and an increase 
      in power obtained through the application of a correction that is specific to
      this structure. An underappreciated point is that MLMA can also increase power in
      studies without sample structure by implicitly conditioning on associated loci
      other than the candidate locus. Numerous variations on the standard MLMA approach
      have recently been published, with a focus on reducing computational cost. These 
      advances provide researchers applying MLMA methods with many options to choose
      from, but we caution that MLMA methods are still subject to potential pitfalls.
      Here we describe and quantify the advantages and pitfalls of MLMA methods as a
      function of study design and provide recommendations for the application of these
      methods in practical settings.

PG  - 63-6
AB  - The arm of this review was to help general pediatricians and primary care
      physicians in diagnosing and managing cow's milk protein allergy in exclusively
      breast-fed infants. Allergic proctocolitis is a cause of rectal bleeding in
      exclusively breast-fed infants aged from 1 to 6 months.It is due to cow's milk
      protein transferred via breast milk. Diagnosis is based on clinical features and 
      recovery after dietetic therapy. Rectal bleeding generally resolves within 72-96 
      hours of cow's milk protein maternal avoidance. Most infants tolerate cow's milk 
      by their first birthday.

TI  - Fiber in the treatment and maintenance of inflammatory bowel disease: a
      systematic review of randomized controlled trials.
PG  - 576-86
LID - 10.1097/01.MIB.0000437984.92565.31 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dietary fiber may favorably influence fermentation, gastrointestinal 
      inflammation, and disease progression in Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis
      (UC), and pouchitis and offer an attractive therapeutic addition to
      pharmacological treatment. This systematic review appraised data from randomized 
      controlled trials of fiber in the management of inflammatory bowel disease.
      METHODS: The review followed Cochrane and PRISMA recommendations. Seven
      electronic databases were searched along with hand searching and contacting
      experts. Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials of the effects of
      fiber on clinical endpoints (primarily disease activity for treatment or
      maintenance) or physiological outcomes in patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease. RESULTS: In total, 23 randomized controlled trials fulfilled the
      inclusion criteria (UC, 10; Crohn's disease, 12; and pouchitis, 1) recruiting
      1296 patients. In UC, 3/10 studies reported fiber supplementation to benefit
      disease outcomes. In Crohn's disease, 0/12 studies and in pouchitis 1/1 study
      reported a benefit on disease activity. Despite this, a number of studies
      reported favorable intragroup effects on physiological outcomes including fecal
      butyrate, fecal calprotectin, inflammatory cytokines, microbiota, and
      gastrointestinal symptom indices. Meta-analysis was not possible. CONCLUSIONS:
      There is limited weak evidence for the efficacy of fiber in improving disease
      outcomes in UC and pouchitis. The potential antiinflammatory role of fiber is
      intriguing and merits further investigation in adequately powered clinical
      trials. Excluding overt gastrointestinal obstruction, there was no evidence that 
      fiber intake should be restricted in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

AB  - Curcumin is a phytocompound found in the root of turmeric, a common herbal
      ingredient in many Asian cuisines. The compound contains anti-inflammatory
      activity, which is mediated through an up-regulation of adiponectin and reduction
      of leptin. Consumption of curcumin was shown to prevent some deteriorative
      conditions caused by inflammation, such as ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid
      arthritis and esophagitis, and so on. Inflammation-associated cardiovascular
      conditions such as atherosclerosis are common in diabetes patients. The
      anti-inflammation effect of curcumin might be beneficial to prevent such
      condition in these patients. We aim to evaluate an antiatherosclerosis effect of 
      curcumin in diabetes patients. Effects of curcumin on risk factors for
      atherosclerosis were investigated in a 6-month randomized, double-blinded and
      placebo-controlled clinical trial that included subjects diagnosed with type 2
      diabetes. An atherosclerosis parameter, the pulse wave velocity, and other
      metabolic parameters in patients treated with placebo and curcumin were compared.
      Our results showed that curcumin intervention significantly reduced pulse wave
      velocity, increased level of serum adiponectin and decreased level of leptin.
      These results are associated with reduced levels of homeostasis model
      assessment-insulin resistance, triglyceride, uric acid, visceral fat and total
      body fat. In summary, a 6-month curcumin intervention in type 2 diabetic
      population lowered the atherogenic risks. In addition, the extract helped to
      improve relevant metabolic profiles in this high-risk population.

AB  - Gut microbiota is more and more important since metagenomic research have brought
      new knowledge on this topic especially for human health. Firstly, gut microbiota 
      is a key element for our organism he lives in symbiosis with. Secondly, it
      interacts favorably with many physiological functions of our organism. Thirdly,
      at the opposite, it can be an active participant in intestinal pathologies linked
      to a dysbiosis mainly in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn disease
      or ulcerative colitis but also in obesity, metabolic syndrome, and more prudently
      in autism and behavioral disorders. In order to keep a good health, it is
      essential to protect our gut microbiota as soon as our young age and maintain it 
      healthy. Face to a more and more important number of publications for treating
      certain digestive diseases with fecal microbial transplantation, it needs to be
      very careful and recommend further studies in order to assess risks and define
      standardized protocols. Gut microbiota metabolic capacities towards xenobiotics
      need to be developed, and we must take an interest in the modifications they
      induce on medicinal molecules. On the other hand, it is essential to study the
      potent effects of pesticides and other pollutants on microbiota functions.

      distribution and Shiga toxin genotype.

LID - 10.1099/mic.0.073437-0 [doi]
AB  - Shiga toxin (stx)-producing Escherichia coli O157 : H7 is a prominent food-borne 
      pathogen. Symptoms in human infections range from asymptomatic to haemorrhagic
      colitis and haemolytic uraemic syndrome, and there is a need for methods that
      yield information that can be used to better predict clinical and epidemiological
      outcomes. IS629 is an insertion sequence notable for its prevalence and variable 
      distribution in the chromosome of E. coli O157 : H7, which has been exploited for
      subtyping and strain characterization. In particular, IS629 distribution is
      closely aligned with the major phylogenetic lineages that are known to be
      distinctive in their genome structure and virulence potential. In the present
      study, a comprehensive subtyping method in which IS629-typing was combined with
      stx genotyping was developed using a conventional PCR approach. This method
      consisted of a set of 32 markers based on the unique distribution of IS629 in the
      three major phylogenetic lineages of E. coli O157 : H7 and six additional markers
      to determine the stx genotype, a key virulence signature associated with each
      lineage. The analysis of IS629 loci variation with the 32 markers allowed us to
      determine the IS629 distribution profile (IDP), phylogenetic lineage and genetic 
      relatedness of the 31 E. coli O157 : H7 strains examined. An association between 
      IDP typing and stx genotype was observed. The use of both IDP and the stx
      genotype for strain characterization provided confirmative and complementary data
      in support of lineage placement of closely related strains. In addition,
      IS629/stx profiles were in agreement with strain segregation based on LSPA-6
      (lineage-specific polymorphism assay) and PFGE subtyping, demonstrating its
      potential as a subtyping and strain tracking method.

TI  - Detailed assessment of nutritional status and eating patterns in children with
      gastrointestinal diseases attending an outpatients clinic and contemporary
      healthy controls.
PG  - 700-6
LID - 10.1038/ejcn.2013.286 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: In the era of modern multidisciplinary clinical
      management, very little is known about the prevalence and presentation of
      malnutrition in children with gastrointestinal disorders (GastroD) particularly
      employing composite, global measures of nutritional status. SUBJECTS/METHODS:
      Anthropometry, body composition, dietary intake, eating habits and grip strength 
      were assessed with bedside methods in 168 patients from outpatient
      gastroenterology clinics (n, median (IQR) years; Crohn's disease (CD): n=53, 14.2
      (11.6:15.4); ulcerative colitis (UC): n=27, 12.2 (10.7:14.2); coeliac disease:
      n=31, 9.3 (7.5:13.6); other GastroD: n=57, 9.8 (7.2:13.8)) and compared with 62
      contemporary healthy controls (n, median (IQR): 9.8 (6.9:13.8)) and the results
      of the recent UK, National Diet and Nutritional Survey (NDNS). RESULTS: Children 
      with CD had lower BMI z-scores than controls (median (IQR): -0.3 (-0.9:0.4) vs
      0.3 (-0.6:1.4); P=0.02) but only 2% were classified as thin (BMI z-score <-2
      s.d.). The prevalence of obesity in children with UC was 19%, 6% in CD, 11% in
      children with other GastroD and 15% in controls. No difference was found in grip 
      strength measurement between groups. Except for CD children, the proportion of
      patients with suboptimal micronutrient intake was similar to that of controls and
      the cohort of children from the latest NDNS. A higher proportion of children with
      CD had suboptimal intake for riboflavin, vitamin B6 and calcium and consumed
      significantly more meat products, juices (including carbonated drinks),
      spreads/jams and crisps and savoury snacks and significantly fewer portions of
      dairy, fish, fruits and vegetables compared with healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS:
      GastroD affect children's body composition, growth, strength, dietary intake and 
      eating habits, particularly CD, but to a lesser extent than expected.

LID - 10.1007/s10238-013-0270-5 [doi]
AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) is characterized by chronic inflammation of the colonic
      mucosa. Administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to animals is a frequently
      used model to mimic human colitis. Deregulation of the immune response to the
      enteric microflora or pathogens as well as increased intestinal permeability have
      been proposed as disease-driving mechanisms. To enlarge the understanding of the 
      pathogenesis, we have studied the effect of DSS on the immune system and gut
      microbiota in mice. Intestinal inflammation was verified through histological
      evaluation and myeloperoxidase activity. Immunological changes were assessed by
      flow cytometry in spleen, Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes and through 
      multiplex cytokine profiling. In addition, quantification of the total amount of 
      bacteria on colonic mucosa as well as the total amount of lactobacilli,
      Akkermansia, Desulfovibrio and Enterobacteriaceae was performed by the use of
      quantitative PCR. Diversity and community structure were analysed by terminal
      restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) patterns, and principal
      component analysis was utilized on immunological and T-RFLP patterns. DSS-induced
      colitis show clinical and histological similarities to UC. The composition of the
      colonic microflora was profoundly changed and correlated with several alterations
      of the immune system. The results demonstrate a relationship between multiple
      immunological changes and alterations of the gut microbiota after DSS
      administration. These data highlight and improve the definition of the
      immunological basis of the disease and suggest a role for dysregulation of the
      gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of colitis.

PG  - 63-75
LID - 10.1017/S1466252313000170 [doi]
AB  - Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) strains are food-borne pathogens
      that are an important public health concern. STEC infection is associated with
      severe clinical diseases in human beings, including hemorrhagic colitis (HC) and 
      hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which can lead to kidney failure and death.
      Cattle are the most important STEC reservoir. However, a number of STEC outbreaks
      and HUS cases have been attributed to pork products. In swine, STEC strains are
      known to be associated with edema disease. Nevertheless, the relationship between
      STEC of swine origin and human illness has yet to be determined. This review
      critically summarizes epidemiologic and biological studies of swine STEC. Several
      epidemiologic studies conducted in multiple regions of the world have
      demonstrated that domestic swine can carry and shed STEC. Moreover, animal
      studies have demonstrated that swine are susceptible to STEC O157:H7 infection
      and can shed the bacterium for 2 months. A limited number of molecular
      epidemiologic studies, however, have provided conflicting evidence regarding the 
      relationship between swine STEC and human illness. The role that swine play in
      STEC transmission to people and the contribution to human disease frequency
      requires further evaluation.

TI  - Myroides pelagicus from the gut of Drosophila melanogaster attenuates
      inflammation on dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Probiotics are live microorganisms that confer a health
      benefit on the host when administered in adequate amounts. In the present study, 
      the putative probiotic strain was identified from the gut of Drosophila
      melanogaster and assessed for its protective effect in inflammatory bowel
      disease. METHODS: Active probiotics were screened from the Drosophila
      melanogaster gut by the selection criteria of gastric juice tolerance,
      hydrophobic property, antimicrobial potential, adhesion, and invasion properties.
      The active probiotics were identified by 16s rDNA sequencing and the effect of
      these active probiotics was evaluated in a Dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced 
      mice model by estimating inflammatory markers and histopathological changes.
      RESULTS: Nine Gram-positive and bile salt tolerant bacterial isolates were
      obtained from the gut samples. The isolates PTH 2, PTH 4, and PTH 7 clearly
      showed significant activity in antimicrobial potential, hydrophobic (>74%)
      property, and intestinal juice tolerance. Among these, PTH 7 was selected for
      further studies due to its significant low-invasion ability and it proved capable
      of reducing the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. The 16s rDNA studies
      revealed that PTH 7 was Myroides pelagicus. Administration of M. pelagicus to the
      DSS-induced colitic animals significantly suppressed myeloperoxidase, ALP, and
      malondialdehyde levels, and also lowered levels of proinflammatory cytokine
      expression. Further, the recovery from the disease by the probiotic treatment was
      supported by histopathological and macroscopic observation. The treated animals
      did not show any adverse signs in their physiology or behavior. CONCLUSION:
      Myroides pelagicus successfully prohibited inflammatory markers and acted as a
      potent probiotic. Future studies with this stain might prove its efficacy as a
      drug for the management of colitis.

AB  - In the United States, it is estimated that non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing
      Escherichia coli (STEC) cause more illnesses than STEC O157:H7, and the majority 
      of cases of non-O157 STEC infections are due to serogroups O26, O45, O103, O111, 
      O121, and O145, referred to as the top six non-O157 STEC. The diseases caused by 
      non-O157 STEC are generally milder than those induced by O157 STEC; nonetheless, 
      non-O157 STEC strains have also been associated with serious illnesses such as
      hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome, as well as death. Ruminants,
      particularly cattle, are reservoirs for both O157 and non-O157 STEC, which are
      transmitted to humans by person-to-person or animal contact and by ingestion of
      food or water contaminated with animal feces. Improved strategies to control STEC
      colonization and shedding in cattle and contamination of meat and produce are
      needed. In general, non-O157 STEC respond to stresses such as acid, heat, and
      other stresses induced during food preparation similar to O157 STEC. Similar to
      O157:H7, the top six non-O157 STEC are classified as adulterants in beef by the
      USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service, and regulatory testing for these
      pathogens began in June 2012. Due to the genetic and phenotypic variability of
      non-O157 STEC strains, the development of accurate and reliable methods for
      detection and isolation of these pathogens has been challenging. Since the
      non-O157 STEC are responsible for a large portion of STEC-related illnesses, more
      extensive studies on their physiology, genetics, pathogenicity, and evolution are
      needed in order to develop more effective control strategies.

TI  - Effect of zinc supplementation on superoxide dismutase activity in patients with 
      ulcerative rectocolitis.
PG  - 1434-7
LID - 10.3305/nh.2015.31.3.8402 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ulcerative rectocolitis is characterized by diffuse mucosal
      inflammation and oxidative stress. Thus, the organism activates the antioxidant
      defence system in an attempt to reduce the excessive production of reactive
      oxygen species or neutralize them. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the effect of 
      zinc supplementation on the activity of the enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) in 
      patients with ulcerative rectocolitis. METHODS: The study included 24 patients,
      aged between 20 and 59 years and diagnosed with ulcerative rectocolitis, in the
      remission stage of the disease, who were divided into two groups: experimental - 
      deficient in zinc (n=12) and control - normal or high zinc (n=12). Only the first
      group underwent supplement intervention, in the form of zinc gluconate (30 mg
      Zn/day), taken daily in the morning, fasted for 60 days. Plasma and erythrocyte
      zinc concentrations were determined by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer.
      The erythrocyte SOD activity was determined in vitro according to the methodology
      recommended by the manufacturer Randox. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Zinc
      supplementation caused a significant increase in the plasma concentrations of the
      mineral, and showed a significant reduction in erythrocyte zinc, remaining within
      normal limits. The SOD activity was high in patients of both the experimental and
      control groups, with no difference after supplementation. CONCLUSION: This study 
      demonstrates that zinc supplementation improves the homeostatic condition of the 
      mineral, with no change in SOD activity, as a marker of oxidative stress in
      patients with ulcerative rectocolitis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The phenolic compounds present in olive leaves (Olea europaea L.)
      confer benefits to the human health. OBJECTIVES: To review the scientific
      literature about the benefits of the polyphenols of olive leaves to human health.
      METHOD: Literature review in the LILACS-BIREME, SciELO and MEDLINE databases for 
      publications in English, Portuguese and Spanish with the descriptors "Olea
      europaea", "olive leaves", "olive leaf", "olive leaves extracts", "olive leaf
      extracts", "phenolic compounds", "polyphenols", "oleuropein", "chemical
      composition", and "health". There were identified 92 articles, but only 38
      related to the objectives of the study and 9 articles cited in the works were
      included due to their relevance. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The phenolic compounds
      present in olive leaves, especially the oleuropein, are associated to
      antioxidant, antihypertensive, hypoglycemic, hypocholesterolemic and
      cardioprotective activity. Furthermore, studies associate the oleuropein to an
      anti-inflammatory effect in trauma of the bone marrow and as a support in the
      treatment of obesity.

      stationary-phase cells.
PG  - 595-600
LID - 10.1016/j.bmcl.2013.12.015 [doi]
AB  - Current antibiotics for treating Clostridium difficile infections (CDI), that is,
      metronidazole, vancomycin and more recently fidaxomicin, are mostly effective but
      treatment failure and disease relapse remain as significant clinical problems.
      The shortcomings of these agents are attributed to their low selectivity for C.
      difficile over normal gut microflora and their ineffectiveness against C.
      difficile spores. This Letter reports that certain diarylacylhydrazones
      identified during a high-throughput screening/counter-screening campaign show
      selective activity against two Clostridium species (C. difficile and Clostridium 
      perfringens) over common gut commensals. Representative examples are shown to
      possess activity similar to vancomycin against clinical C. difficile strains and 
      to kill stationary-phase C. difficile cells, which are responsible for spore
      production. Structure-activity relationships with additional synthesised
      analogues suggested a protonophoric mechanism may play a role in the observed
      activity/selectivity and this was supported by the well-known protonophore
      carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) showing selective
      anti-Clostridium effects and activity similar to diarylacylhydrazones against
      stationary-phase C. difficile cells. Two diarylacylhydrazones were shown to be
      non-toxic towards human FaDu and Hep G2 cells indicating that further studies
      with the class are warranted towards new drugs for CDI.

TI  - The role of total parenteral nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease: current
      aspects.
PG  - 3-14
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2013.860557 [doi]
AB  - Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) represents a therapeutic modality that could
      save the life of a patient with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) facing severe
      nutritional problems, by restoring the patient's impaired nutritional status. TPN
      does not compete with enteral nutrition (EN), the latter being the first choice
      for all patients having anatomically intact and functionally normal digestive
      tract. TPN allows bowel rest while supplying adequate calorific intake and
      essential nutrients, and removes antigenic mucosal stimuli. The value of TPN in
      malnourished patients with intestinal failure due to CD is beyond doubt. However,
      it is difficult to suggest TPN as a sole treatment for active CD. An increased
      rate of remission could not be expected by applying TPN. The utility of TPN is
      restricted to certain cases involving efforts to close enterocutaneous or other
      complicated fistulas in patients with fistulizing CD, the treatment of short
      bowel syndrome following extensive resections for CD, or when EN is impractical
      for other reasons. There are no advantages of TPN therapy over EN therapy
      regarding fistula healing. TPN has no influence on the surgical intervention rate
      and little benefit by bypassing the intestinal passage could be expected. Also
      TPN shows no advantage if the disease is chronically active. However, an optimal 
      supply of nutrients improves bowel motility, intestinal permeability and
      nutritional status, and reduces inflammatory reactions. TPN might be associated
      with an increased risk of adverse events, although TPN undertaken by experienced 
      teams does not cause more complications than does EN.

TI  - Altered human gut dendritic cell properties in ulcerative colitis are reversed by
      Lactobacillus plantarum extracellular encrypted peptide STp.
PG  - 1132-43
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201300596 [doi]
AB  - SCOPE: The human/microbiota cross-talk is partially mediated by bacteria-derived 
      peptides like Serine-Threonine peptide (STp), which is resistant to gut
      proteolysis, is found in the human healthy colon and induces regulatory
      properties on gut dendritic cells (DCs); here we characterized human gut DC in
      ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and studied the effect of STp on their
      properties. METHODS AND RESULTS: Human colonic DC from healthy controls and UC
      patients were isolated, conditioned for 24 h +/- STp and characterized by flow
      cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy. Expression of immature 
      DC markers DC-SIGN and ILT3, and Toll-like receptors were increased on gut UC-DC.
      Langerin (involved in phagocytosis), lymph node homing marker CCR7, and
      activation markers CD40/CD80/CD86 were decreased in UC. Gut DC had restricted
      stimulatory capacity for T-cells in UC. Conditioning of DC with STp in vitro
      reduced Toll-like receptor expression, increased CD40 and CD80 expression, and
      restored their stimulatory capacity. CONCLUSION: Colonic DCs display an abnormal 
      immature phenotype in UC, which was partially restored following STp treatment.
      Bacteria-derived metabolites, like STp, seem to have a role in gut homeostasis
      that is missing in UC so they might lead a new era of probiotic products setting 
      the basis for nondrug dietary therapy in inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Environmental factors in a population-based inception cohort of inflammatory
      bowel disease patients in Europe--an ECCO-EpiCom study.

LID - S1873-9946(13)00410-8 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is
      increasing in Eastern Europe possibly due to changes in environmental factors
      towards a more "westernised" standard of living. The aim of this study was to
      investigate differences in exposure to environmental factors prior to diagnosis
      in Eastern and Western European IBD patients. METHODS: The EpiCom cohort is a
      population-based, prospective inception cohort of 1560 unselected IBD patients
      from 31 European countries covering a background population of 10.1 million. At
      the time of diagnosis patients were asked to complete an 87-item questionnaire
      concerning environmental factors. RESULTS: A total of 1182 patients (76%)
      answered the questionnaire, 444 (38%) had Crohn's disease (CD), 627 (53%)
      ulcerative colitis (UC), and 111 (9%) IBD unclassified. No geographic differences
      regarding smoking status, caffeine intake, use of oral contraceptives, or number 
      of first-degree relatives with IBD were found. Sugar intake was higher in CD and 
      UC patients from Eastern Europe than in Western Europe while fibre intake was
      lower (p<0.01). Daily consumption of fast food as well as appendectomy before the
      age of 20 was more frequent in Eastern European than in Western European UC
      patients (p<0.01). Eastern European CD and UC patients had received more
      vaccinations and experienced fewer childhood infections than Western European
      patients (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In this European population-based inception
      cohort of unselected IBD patients, Eastern and Western European patients differed
      in environmental factors prior to diagnosis. Eastern European patients exhibited 
      higher occurrences of suspected risk factors for IBD included in the Western
      lifestyle.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Fatigue, weakness and musculoskeletal manifestations are
      associated with IBD. An impaired nutritional status and a reduced physical
      activity can contribute to these clinical outcomes, impacting quality of life and
      increasing disability. This study aims to assess muscle strength and lower limb
      physical performance in female UC patients, taking into consideration disease
      activity, body composition and habitual physical activity. METHODS: A
      case-control study was performed including 23 UC female outpatients and 23 age-
      and BMI-matched healthy women as controls. Quadriceps strength (QS), handgrip
      strength (HGS), physical performance based measures (five repetitions sit-up test
      and 4meter gait speed test), body composition (bioelectrical impedance analysis, 
      anthropometry), and habitual physical activity (HPA) levels were assessed.
      RESULTS: UC group had decreased QS (-6%; P=0.012), slower sit-up test (-32%;
      P=0.000), slower gait speed (-17% P=0.002) and decreased HPA level (-30%,
      P=0.001) compared with controls. No difference in HGS was observed between
      groups. Logistic regression showed that UC was an independent factor for
      decreased QS and slower sit-up test, while HPA was a protective factor for
      impaired gait speed. Multivariate linear regression showed that BMI was
      independently associated with an improved QS and slower sit-up test in the UC
      group. CONCLUSION: Women with UC had decreased lower limb strength and mobility
      limitations, which were associated with BMI and the level of physical activity.
      Early evaluation of nutritional status and performance of the lower limbs could
      identify UC patients with pre-clinical disability who may benefit from earlier
      health lifestyle modifications.

TI  - Polymorphisms in the sodium-dependent ascorbate transporter gene SLC23A1 are
      associated with susceptibility to Crohn disease.
PG  - 378-83
LID - 10.3945/ajcn.113.068015 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are 2 common
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) associated with intestinal inflammation and
      tissue damage. Oxidative stress is suggested to play a major role in the
      initiation and progression of IBD. Vitamin C (ascorbate, ascorbic acid)
      supplementation has reduced oxidative stress in persons with IBD. The role of
      ascorbate transporters in IBD remains to be determined. SLC23A1 is a major
      ascorbate transporter in the intestinal tract, and some of its genetic variants
      have been associated with severely decreased ascorbate transport and lower
      systemic concentrations. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether common 
      genetic variants in the vitamin C transporter SLC23A1 are associated with the
      risk of IBD. DESIGN: Genomic DNA samples from patients with CD (n = 162) and UC
      (n = 149) from the Manitoba IBD Cohort Study and ethnically matched controls (n =
      142) were genotyped for 3 SLC23A1 polymorphisms (rs6596473, rs33972313, and
      rs10063949) by using TaqMan assays. RESULTS: Variation at rs10063949 (G allele
      for heterozygote and homozygote) was associated with increased susceptibility to 
      CD (OR: 2.54; 95% CI: 1.38, 4.66; OR: 4.72; 95% CI: 2.53, 8.81; P < 0.0001;
      respectively). A strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) was observed across the
      SLC23A1 region (variation rs6596473 with rs10063949) for CD and UC (D' = 0.94 and
      0.96, respectively). The risk alleles confirmed a haplotype (CGG) that is carried
      more in CD patients (65.3%, P < 0.0001) than in controls (43.5%). CONCLUSIONS: A 
      genetic variant (rs10063949-G) in the SLC23A1 ascorbate transporter locus was
      identified and is associated with an increased risk of CD in a white Canadian IBD
      cohort. The presented evidence that SLC23A1 variations can modulate the risk of
      CD has implications for understanding ascorbate transport in CD patients and
      provides a novel opportunity toward individualized nutritional therapy for
      patients carrying the disease-associated genotype.

TI  - Effect of probiotics on inducing remission and maintaining therapy in ulcerative 
      colitis, Crohn's disease, and pouchitis: meta-analysis of randomized controlled
      trials.
PG  - 21-35
LID - 10.1097/01.MIB.0000437495.30052.be [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Whether probiotics are beneficial at all stages of treatment in
      inflammatory bowel disease or superior to placebo remains controversial. METHODS:
      Two reviewers independently selected randomized controlled trials comparing
      probiotics with controls in inflammatory bowel disease and extracted data related
      to remission/response rates, relapse rates, and adverse events. Subanalyses were 
      also performed. RESULTS: Twenty-three randomized controlled trials with a total
      of 1763 participants met the inclusion criteria. From the meta-analysis,
      probiotics significantly increase the remission rates in patients with active
      ulcerative colitis (UC) (P = 0.01, risk ratio [RR] = 1.51). The remission rates
      were significantly higher in patients with active UC treated with probiotics than
      placebo (P < 0.0001, RR = 1.80). Unfortunately, subgroup analysis found that only
      VSL#3 significantly increased the remission rates compared with controls in
      patients with active UC (P = 0.004, RR = 1.74). Interestingly, VSL#3 (P <
      0.00001, RR = 0.18) also significantly reduced the clinical relapse rates for
      maintaining remission in patients with pouchitis. No significantly different
      adverse events were detected between probiotics and controls in the treatment of 
      UC (P = 0.94, RR = 0.99) or CD (P = 0.33, RR = 0.87). CONCLUSIONS: Administration
      of probiotics results in additional benefit in inducing remission of patients
      with UC. VSL#3 are beneficial for maintaining remission in patients with
      pouchitis. And, probiotics can provide the similar effect as 5-aminosalicylic
      acid on maintaining remission of UC, although no additional adverse events
      presented.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The present review will highlight recent advances in the
      knowledge of emerging pathogens causing infectious colitis and provide a
      description of the most important food-borne outbreaks. RECENT FINDINGS:
      Outbreaks of enteric disease caused by Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., and
      Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) continue to surprise with new
      epidemiological findings or changing virulence characteristics. These pathogens
      evolve to exploit novel opportunities for spread and transmission, such as fresh 
      produce within the food chain, and generate new public health challenges. Organic
      sprouts were recently considered as the source responsible for a large German
      disease outbreak comprising 3842 patients. The outbreak strain was identified as 
      an enteroaggregative STEC O104:H4 (EAggC), a rare hybrid pathogen that harbours
      the phage encoded Shiga toxin gene and antibiotic resistance in an EAggEC
      background. Clostridium difficile PCR ribotype 078 is emerging across Europe,
      causing severe disease outside healthcare facilities as well as disease in farm
      animals, indicating that the species border has been crossed. Although the global
      impact of cryptosporidiosis is less pronounced, these organisms have been
      responsible for large outbreaks of infectious diarrhoea, often not reported.
      Invasive listeriosis is a serious food-borne illness and was found recently in 28
      US states affecting 147 patients, associated with eating contaminated cantaloupe.
      Outbreaks of gastroenteritis caused by Listeria monocytogenes are most likely
      severely underestimated. Centralized surveillance of food-borne enteropathogens
      is essential for the early detection of disease outbreaks and for the
      organization of an immediate and appropriate response. SUMMARY: An improved
      understanding of the pathogenesis, pathology and epidemiology of emerging
      enteropathogens causing infectious colitis will provide new approaches for
      disease prevention and control.

      and human IBD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease with
      increasing incidence in children. Current medications have potentially serious
      side effects, hence increasing interest in alternative therapies. We previously
      developed an herbal formula, FAHF-2, based on a classical traditional Chinese
      herbal formula Wu Mei Wan that has long been used in China to treat colitis. We
      investigated FAHF-2's potential anti-inflammatory effects. METHODS: FAHF-2
      efficacy was tested in vivo in the CD45RbRAG1 transfer colitis model. Weight
      loss, colonic histology, and cytokine production from mesenteric lymph nodes were
      assessed. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and colonic biopsies
      were obtained from children newly diagnosed with CD and controls and cultured
      with or without FAHF-2. Cytokine levels were measured by multiplex immunoassay.
      The effect of FAHF-2 on TNF-alpha-producing cells was determined by flow
      cytometry. NF-kappaB signaling was investigated in human lamina propria
      mononuclear cells upon FAHF-2 treatment by In-Cell Western. RESULTS:
      FAHF-2-treated mice had decreased weight loss, improved histology, and reduced
      TNF-alpha, IL-17, IL-6, and IFN-gamma production. In vitro treated PBMCs produced
      less TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and IL-12. FAHF-2 reduced the TNF-alpha-producing
      monocytes and T cells. Inflamed CD biopsies produced less TNF-alpha, IL-17, IL-6,
      and IL-1beta. These effects are because of decreased NF-kappaB activation.
      CONCLUSIONS: FAHF-2 inhibited both adaptive and innate immune proinflammatory
      cytokine responses in PBMCs and inflamed CD mucosa due in part to blockage of
      NF-kappaB activation. FAHF-2 was effective in halting progression of colitis in a
      murine model. This study shows that FAHF-2 has potential as a novel treatment of 
      CD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin D insufficiency has been suggested to be associated with high
      risk of Crohn's disease (CD). In France, where food fortification is limited, the
      major source of vitamin D is through sun exposure. The aim of this work was to
      analyze the relationship between residential sun exposure and the risk of
      incident CD or ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: The E3N cohort consists of women
      living in France, aged 40 to 65 years and free of major diseases at inclusion in 
      1990. Among the 91,870 women included in the study, we identified 123 incident
      cases (45 CD, 71 UC, and 7 indeterminate colitis). To assess residential sun
      exposure, we used a database containing mean daily ultraviolet radiation (UVR)
      dose for each French county. The relationship between residential sun exposure
      and risk of incident inflammatory bowel diseases was explored using Cox models.
      RESULTS: Higher levels of residential sun exposure were associated with a
      significant decreased risk of CD (hazard ratio [HR] for the third versus the
      first tertile of UVR dose, 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.23-1.01; P for
      trend = 0.04), but not of UC (HR, 1.21; CI, 0.61-2.11). In women with available
      data on dietary vitamin D intake, we observed a lower risk of CD with higher
      residential UVR (HR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.11-0.80; P for trend = 0.01). Dietary
      vitamin D intake was neither associated with the risk of CD (HR, 0.41; 95% CI,
      0.14-1.24; P for trend = 0.14) nor UC (HR, 1.61; CI, 0.61-4.23). CONCLUSIONS: In 
      this prospective cohort of women, high residential sunlight exposure was
      associated with decreased incidence of CD, but not UC.

TI  - The crystal structure of shiga toxin type 2 with bound disaccharide guides the
      design of a heterobifunctional toxin inhibitor.
PG  - 885-94
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M113.518886 [doi]
AB  - Shiga toxin type 2 (Stx2a) is clinically most closely associated with
      enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7-mediated hemorrhagic colitis that sometimes
      progresses to hemolytic-uremic syndrome. The ability to express the toxin has
      been acquired by other Escherichia coli strains, and outbreaks of food poisoning 
      have caused significant mortality rates as, for example, in the 2011 outbreak in 
      northern Germany. Stx2a, an AB5 toxin, gains entry into human cells via the
      glycosphingolipid receptor Gb3. We have determined the first crystal structure of
      a disaccharide analog of Gb3 bound to the B5 pentamer of Stx2a holotoxin. In this
      Gb3 analog,-GalNAc replaces the terminal-Gal residue. This co-crystal structure
      confirms previous inferences that two of the primary binding sites identified in 
      theB5 pentamer of Stx1 are also functional in Stx2a. This knowledge provides a
      rationale for the synthesis and evaluation of heterobifunctional antagonists for 
      E. coli toxins that target Stx2a. Incorporation of GalNAc Gb3 trisaccharide in a 
      heterobifunctional ligand with an attached pyruvate acetal, a ligand for human
      amyloid P component, and conjugation to
      poly[acrylamide-co-(3-azidopropylmethacrylamide)] produced a polymer that
      neutralized Stx2a in a mouse model of Shigatoxemia.

LID - 10.1007/s00005-013-0261-y [doi]
AB  - Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS; recurrent aphthous ulcers; canker sores)
      belongs to the group of chronic, inflammatory, ulcerative diseases of the oral
      mucosa. Up to now, the etiopathogenesis of this condition remains unclear; it is,
      however, considered to be multifactorial. The results of currently performed
      studies indicate that genetically mediated disturbances of the innate and
      acquired immunity play an important role in the disease development. Factors that
      modify the immunologic response in RAS include: food allergies, vitamin and
      microelement deficiencies, hormonal and gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., celiac 
      disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis), some viral and bacterial
      infections, mechanical injuries and stress. In this paper, we presented the main 
      etiopathogenetic factors of RAS with a special emphasis on the mechanisms of the 
      immune response modification. Moreover, we discussed the crucial clinical
      symptoms and types of RAS together with epidemiologic data based on the current
      medical literature reports and our own observations.

TI  - Dietary arachidonic and oleic acid intake in ulcerative colitis etiology: a
      prospective cohort study using 7-day food diaries.
PG  - 11-8
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0b013e328365c372 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dietary fatty acids may be involved in the etiology of ulcerative
      colitis (UC). Arachidonic acid (AA), an n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid, is a
      precursor of the proinflammatory cytokines prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4,
      and its metabolism is competitively inhibited by oleic acid (OA). This study
      aimed to prospectively investigate whether AA is positively and OA is negatively 
      associated with incident UC development, using data from 7-day food diaries.
      METHODS: A total of 25 639 men and women, aged between 40 and 79 years, from
      Norfolk, UK, were recruited into the prospective European Prospective
      Investigation into Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk cohort between 1993 and 1997. At
      baseline, participants completed 7-day food diaries, checked by nutritionists
      using a database containing 11 000 foods and 55 000 portion sizes. The cohort was
      monitored until June 2004 to identify participants who developed UC. Each patient
      was matched for age and sex with four controls, and conditional logistic
      regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios for AA and OA intakes, and 
      UC association. RESULTS: Of the participants, 26 (58% men) developed incident UC 
      (53% left sided) after a median follow-up time of 3.8 years (0.5-8.3 years). The 
      highest AA tertile was positively associated with an odds ratio of 6.09 [95%
      confidence interval (CI) 1.05-35.23], with a trend across tertiles [odds ratio
      (OR) 2.43, 95% CI 1.06-5.61, P=0.04]. The highest tertile of OA intake was
      inversely associated with a 0.03 OR for UC (95% CI 0.002-0.56) and an inverse
      trend (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.10-0.90, P=0.03). CONCLUSION: Dietary AA was positively 
      and OA was inversely associated with UC development, with large effect sizes in a
      dose-dependent manner. This supports roles for measuring these nutrients in
      future etiological studies and modifying intake in future interventional studies 
      in patients with established disease.

AB  - Omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) have well documented
      anti-inflammatory properties, and consequently therapeutic potential in chronic
      inflammatory diseases. Here we discuss the effects of n-3 PUFAs on various
      inflammatory pathways and how this leads to alterations in the function of
      inflammatory cells, most importantly endothelial cells and leukocytes. Strong
      evidence indicates n-3 PUFAs are beneficial as a dietary supplement in certain
      diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis; however for other conditions such as
      asthma, the data are less robust. A clearer understanding of the pharmacology of 
      n-3 PUFAs will help to establish targets to modulate chronic inflammatory
      diseases.

AB  - Probiotic microorganisms have historically been used to rebalance disturbed
      intestinal microbiota and to diminish gastrointestinal disorders, such as
      diarrhea or inflammatory bowel diseases (e.g., Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis). Recent studies explore the potential for expanded uses of probiotics on
      medical disorders that increase the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases
      and diabetes, such as obesity, hypercholesterolemia, arterial hypertension, and
      metabolic disturbances such as hyperhomocysteinemia and oxidative stress. This
      review aims at summarizing the proposed molecular and cellular mechanisms
      involved in probiotic-host interactions and to identify the nature of the
      resulting beneficial effects. Specific probiotic strains can act by modulating
      immune response, by producing particular molecules or releasing biopeptides, and 
      by modulating nervous system activity. To date, the majority of studies have been
      conducted in animal models. New investigations on the related mechanisms in
      humans need to be carried out to better enable targeted and effective use of the 
      broad variety of probiotic strains.

AB  - We report the case of a 69-year-old man who presented with acute kidney injury in
      the setting of community-acquired Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea and
      biopsy-proven acute oxalate nephropathy. We discuss potential mechanisms,
      including increased colonic permeability to oxalate. We conclude that C
      difficile-associated diarrhea is a potential cause of acute oxalate nephropathy.

TI  - Role of probiotics in the management of pouchitis.
PG  - 4561-4
AB  - The concept that the gut microbiota plays a major role in the development of
      pouchitis in ulcerative colitis patients after restorative proctocolectomy with
      ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, is widely accepted and supported by a widespread
      use of some antibiotics (metronidazole and/or ciprofloxacin, rifaximin) to treat 
      this condition. A possible, safer therapeutic alternative is represented by
      probiotics. To date the controlled studies addressing the possible efficacy of
      probiotic agents in the treatment of active pouchitis are few and inconclusive.
      By contrast the prophylactic use of a probiotic mixture (VSL #3) appears to be
      able to prevent development of pouchitis. The most convincing results have been
      observed in the maintenance of remission, where the probiotic mixture has been
      found, in most of the performed controlled trials, significantly effective in
      preventing pouchitis recurrence.

TI  - Probiotics in the management of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 4556-60
AB  - Probiotics are nowadays frequently used by patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease, however literature data are conflicting related to their importance. In 
      mild to moderate ulcerative colitis probiotics can be used effectively in
      induction and maintaining remission, and prevention of pouchitis. As the other
      side of the shield, there is not sufficient evidence to support the use of
      probiotics in daily clinical practice in Crohn's disease. The aim of the present 
      review is to provide help for clinicians about the probiotic use in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease. The comparison of literature data is limited by the
      large number of probiotic strains, various combined preparations, and different
      doses applied in the clinical studies. Small number of comparable protocols and
      lack of standardization encumber the analysis of study results.

TI  - Exogenous pigment in Peyer patches of children suspected of having IBD.
PG  - 477-80
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000221 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The base of human Peyer patches of the terminal ileum has been noted 
      to contain black granular pigment deposits, composed of titanium dioxide and
      aluminosilicate, which are food additives typically present in a Western diet,
      and pharmaceuticals. In the present study, we investigated the distribution of
      exogenous pigment throughout the gastrointestinal tract of children suspected of 
      having inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the correlation between their age and
      the presence and amount of pigment in Peyer patches, and its relation to
      pediatric IBD. METHODS: Biopsies (upper and lower gastrointestinal tract) from
      children suspected of having IBD who underwent endoscopy, were reassessed by a
      blinded, expert pathologist. The amount of pigment in biopsies was scored using a
      semiquantitative scale (range 0 to +++). RESULTS: A total of 151 children were
      included: 62 with Crohn disease (CD), 26 with ulcerative colitis, and 63 with
      non-IBD. In 63 children (42%), deposits of black pigment were found only in
      biopsies from the terminal ileum, located in Peyer patches. A significant
      correlation was found between increasing age and the amount of pigment (P =
      0.004). Pigment deposits were found significantly less in the patients with CD
      compared with those in patients with ulcerative colitis and those with non-IBD
      (26% vs 62% and 49%, P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: These results provide support for
      the hypothesis that the amount of pigment, only present in Peyer patches in the
      terminal ileum, becomes denser with increasing age. Absence of pigment in Peyer
      patches in a higher number of patients with CD suggests that microparticles may
      have become involved in the inflammatory process, possibly because of disrupted
      autophagy.

TI  - Vitamin D and Crohn's disease in the adult patient: a review.
PG  - 438-58
LID - 10.1177/0148607113506013 [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) is characterized as a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory
      disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. Current consensus surrounding the cause
      of the disease suggests a complex interplay between genetic susceptibility, the
      intestinal microbiome and environmental factors, leading to the aberrant Th1 and 
      Th17 immune cell mediated response. Vitamin D deficiency is common in CD
      patients, and long-standing deficiency has been associated with reduced bone
      mineral density (BMD). Accumulating evidence now suggests that in addition to
      maintaining skeletal integrity, vitamin D also plays an integral role in
      regulating the general immune response, a function employed via its genomic
      actions on the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The VDR is expressed in all immune cells
      and both directly and indirectly targeted by the bioactive form of vitamin D,
      1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]2D). Impaired regulation or deficiency of the
      vitamin has been linked to the promotion of self-reactive T cell development,
      loss of immune tolerance to self-structures, and experimental colitis in animal
      models, whereas the subsequent administration of the vitamin in these models
      resulted in the improvement of immune-mediated symptoms. In addition, low vitamin
      D has been associated with disease activity in CD patients, and supplementation
      appears to be beneficial in improving clinical scores and reducing inflammation. 
      Therefore, the primary aims of this article were to review the molecular evidence
      supporting the immunoregulatory roles of vitamin D and its supplementation in the
      CD patient, based on existing literature. The physiological processes, accepted
      serum concentration values, and its well-recognized role in bone health were also
      summarized.

TI  - Treatment of bone loss in osteopenic patients with Crohn's disease: a
      double-blind, randomised trial of oral risedronate 35 mg once weekly or placebo, 
      concomitant with calcium and vitamin D supplementation.
PG  - 1424-30
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2013-305523 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Osteoporosis and fractures are frequently encountered in patients with
      Crohn's disease. In order to prevent fractures, treatment with bone protecting
      drugs appears warranted early in the course of bone disease when bone loss is not
      yet prominent. We therefore aimed to demonstrate a beneficial effect on bone
      density of the bisphosphonate risedronate in osteopenic Crohn's disease patients.
      METHODS: This double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial of risedronate
      with calcium and vitamin D supplementation was performed in osteopenic Crohn's
      disease patients. Patients were treated for 2 years with follow-up after 3 and
      after every 6 months. Disease characteristics and activity and bone turnover
      markers were assessed at all visits; dual x-ray absorptiometry was performed at
      baseline, 12 and 24 months; radiographs of the spine at baseline and 24 months.
      RESULTS: Of 132 consenting patients, 131 were randomised (67 placebo and 64
      risedronate). Patient characteristics were similar in both groups, although the
      risedronate group was slightly heavier (body mass index 24.3 vs 23.0 kg/m(2)).
      Bone mineral density at lumbar spine increased 0.04 g/cm(2) on average in the
      risedronate group versus 0.01 g/cm(2) in the placebo group (p=0.007). The mean
      increase in total hip bone mineral density was 0.03 versus 0.01 g/cm(2),
      respectively (p=0.071). Fracture prevalence and incidence were similar. Change of
      T-scores and concentrations of bone turnover markers were consistent with a
      beneficial effect of risedronate when compared with placebo. The effect of
      risedronate was primarily demonstrated in the first 12 months of treatment. No
      serious unexpected suspected adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: A
      24-month treatment course with risedronate 35 mg once weekly, concomitant with
      calcium and vitamin D supplementation, in osteopenic Crohn's disease patients
      improved bone density at lumbar spine. NTR 163 Dutch Trial Register.

TI  - Sphingomyelin and phosphatidylcholine contrarily affect the induction of
      apoptosis in intestinal epithelial cells.
PG  - 782-98

AB  - SCOPE: The major alimentary sources for the plasma membrane lipid sphingomyelin
      (SM) are dairy products, eggs, and meat. We recently reported that the SM
      metabolite ceramide induces cathepsin D mediated apoptosis in murine intestinal
      epithelial cells (IECs) and increases inflammation in acute colitis. We
      investigated the impact of SM and phosphatidylcholine on apoptosis in human IECs 
      and point out BH3-interacting death agonist (BID) as link between cathepsin D and
      apoptosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: HT-29 and isolated human IECs were stimulated
      with SM or phosphatidylcholine. SM treatment resulted in increased apoptosis.
      Phosphatidylcholine showed contrary effects. Western revealed higher amounts of
      cathepsin D and BID activation upon lipid stimulation. Western blotting revealed 
      BID activation through SM in both an induced and a spontaneous mouse model of
      colitis. CONCLUSION: Dietary phospholipids may induce or abolish apoptosis in
      IECs and seem to play a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases. 
      This nutritional factor might be considered when evaluating the pathogenesis of
      inflammatory bowel diseases. Effects of SMase- and SM treatment on inflammation
      in dextran sulfate sodium induced animal models of colitis and in vitro
      experiments are discussed as controversial. Variable sources of SM, feeding
      techniques, and mouse strains might play a role.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the literature for clinical data on infants with allergic or
      eosinophilic colitis. DATA SOURCE: MEDLINE search of all indexes was performed
      using the words "colitis or proctocolitis and eosinophilic" or "colitis or
      proctocolitis and allergic" between 1966 and February of 2013. All articles that 
      described patients' characteristics were selected. DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 770
      articles were identified, of which 32 met the inclusion criteria. The 32 articles
      included a total of 314 infants. According to the available information, 61.6% of
      infants were male and 78.6% were younger than 6 months. Of the 314 patients,
      49.0% were fed exclusively breast milk, 44.2% received cow's milk protein, and
      6.8% received soy protein. Diarrheal stools were described in 28.3% of patients. 
      Eosinophilia was found in 43.8% (115/263) of infants. Colonic or rectal biopsy
      showed infiltration by eosinophils (between 5 and 25 per high-power field) in
      89.3% (236/264) of patients. Most patients showed improvement with the removal of
      the protein in cow's milk from their diet or the mother's diet. Allergy challenge
      tests with cow's milk protein were cited by 12 of the 32 articles (66 patients). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Eosinophilic colitis occurs predominantly in the first six months of
      life and in males. Allergy to cow's milk was considered the main cause of
      eosinophilic colitis. Exclusion of cow's milk from the diet of the lactating
      mother or from the infant's diet is generally an effective therapeutic measure.

PG  - 12-7

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Presently, there is no consensus on endpoint measures to assess
      clinical outcomes for pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC). This study reviewed the 
      endpoints used in the registration trials of approved drugs for pediatric UC.
      METHODS: The primary efficacy endpoints of all registration trials completed from
      1950 to 2008 that led to Food and Drug Administration approval for indications in
      pediatric and adult UC were reviewed. RESULTS: Colazal and Remicade have been
      approved for pediatric UC indication, and clinical response was used as a primary
      endpoint in these registration trials. The clinical response in the adult Colazal
      trials was defined as a reduction of rectal bleeding and improvement in at least 
      one of the other assessed symptoms (stool frequency, patient functional
      assessment, abdominal pain, sigmoidoscopic grade, and physician's global
      assessment) assessed by the Sutherland UC Activity Index. The pediatric Colazal
      trial defined clinical response using the Modified Sutherland UC Activity Index, 
      which excluded abdominal pain and functional assessment. Both adult and pediatric
      Remicade trials used clinical response defined by the Mayo score as the primary
      endpoint. The Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index was used to measure
      various secondary endpoints in the pediatric Remicade trial. CONCLUSIONS:
      Pediatric-specific endpoints were used, but outcome measures and definition of
      clinical response were not consistent in pediatric UC trials. Consensus on the
      definition of successful treatment outcome (clinical response and/or remission)
      and collaboration in the development of well-defined and reliable measures of
      signs and symptoms for use in conjunction with endoscopic parameters of mucosal
      healing will facilitate pediatric drug development.

AB  - Patients have strong beliefs about the role of diet in the cause of inflammatory 
      bowel disease (IBD) and in exacerbating or alleviating ongoing symptoms from IBD.
      The rapid increase in the incidence and prevalence of IBD in recent decades
      strongly suggests an environmental trigger for IBD, one of which may be dietary
      patterns. There are several pathways where diet may influence intestinal
      inflammation, such as direct dietary antigens, altering the gut microbiome, and
      affecting gastrointestinal permeability. However, data that altering diet can
      change the natural history of IBD are scarce, and evidence-based dietary
      guidelines for patients with IBD are lacking. Patients, therefore, seek
      nonmedical resources for dietary guidance, such as patient support groups and
      unverified sources on the Internet. The aim of this review is to identify
      patient-targeted dietary recommendations for IBD and to critically appraise the
      nutritional value of these recommendations. We review patient-targeted dietary
      information for IBD from structured Internet searches and popular defined diets. 
      Patient-targeted dietary recommendations focus on food restrictions and are
      highly conflicting. High-quality dietary intervention studies are needed to
      facilitate creation of evidence-based dietary guidelines for patients with IBD.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Osteopenia and increased risk for fractures in IBD result from
      several factors. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the dietary intake of calcium
      in IBD patients. METHODS: A 22-item quantitative validated frequency food
      questionnaire was used for quantifying dietary calcium in relation to gender and 
      age, in 187 IBD patients, 420 normal- and 276 diseased controls. STATISTICAL
      ANALYSIS: Mann-Whitney, chi-square- and T-tests. RESULTS: The mean calcium intake
      was 991.0 +/- 536.0 (105.8% Recommended Daily Allowances) and 867.6 +/- 562.7 SD 
      mg/day (93.8% RDA) in healthy and diseased controls, and 837.8 +/- 482.0 SD
      mg/day (92.7% RDA) in IBD, P<0.001. Calcium intake was high in celiac disease
      (1165.7 +/- 798.8 SD mg/day, 120% RDA), and non-significantly lower in ulcerative
      colitis than in Crohn's disease (798.7 +/- 544.1 SD mg/day vs 881.9 +/- 433.0).
      CD and UC females, but not males, had a mean calcium intake well under RDA. In
      all study groups the intake was lower in patients believing that consumption of
      lactose-containing food induced symptoms, versus those who did not (105.8% vs
      114.3% RDA in normal controls; 100.4% vs 87.6% RDA in IBD). CONCLUSIONS: Diet in 
      IBD patients contained significantly less calcium than in healthy controls.
      Gender and age, more than diagnosis, are central in determining inadequate
      calcium intake, more so in IBD. Self-reported lactose intolerance, leading to
      dietary restrictions, is the single major determinant of low calcium intake.
      Inadequate calcium intake is present in one third of IBD patients and represents 
      a reversible risk factor for osteoporosis, suggesting the need for tailored
      nutritional advice in IBD.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Emerging evidence supports an immunologic role for
      25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Here we
      examined if pretreatment vitamin D status influences durability of anti-tumor
      necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha therapy in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) or
      ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: All IBD patients who had plasma 25(OH)D level
      checked <3 months prior to initiating anti-TNF-alpha therapy were included in
      this retrospective single-center cohort study. Our main predictor variable was
      insufficient plasma 25(OH)D (<30 ng/mL). Cox proportional hazards model adjusting
      for potential confounders was used to identify the independent effect of
      pretreatment vitamin D on biologic treatment cessation. RESULTS: Our study
      included 101 IBD patients (74 CD; median disease duration 9 years). The median
      index 25(OH)D level was 27 ng/mL (interquartile range, 20-33 ng/mL). One-third of
      the patients had prior exposure to anti-TNF-alpha therapy. On multivariate
      analysis, patients with insufficient vitamin D demonstrated earlier cessation of 
      anti-TNF-alpha therapy (hazard ratio [HR], 2.13; 95% confidence interval [CI],
      1.03-4.39; P = .04). This effect was significant in patients who stopped
      treatment for loss of response (HR, 3.49; 95% CI, 1.34-9.09) and stronger for CD 
      (HR, 2.38; 95% CI, 0.95-5.99) than UC (P = NS). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest
      that vitamin D levels may influence durability of anti-TNF-alpha induction and
      maintenance therapy. Larger cohort studies and clinical trials of supplemental
      vitamin D use with disease activity as an end point may be warranted.

TI  - Impact of CYP3A5 genetic polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics and short-term
      remission in patients with ulcerative colitis treated with tacrolimus.
PG  - 60-6
LID - 10.1111/jgh.12361 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: The pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus (Tac) differ among
      individuals, and genetic polymorphisms of cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 3A4, CYP3A5, and
      ABCB1 are thought to be involved. The aim of this study was to clarify whether
      these genetic polymorphisms affect the pharmacokinetics of Tac in patients with
      ulcerative colitis. METHODS: The subjects in this study were 45 patients with
      moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis who were resistant to other therapies and
      were treated with Tac. The subjects were tested for genetic polymorphisms of
      CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and ABCB1, and the relationship between Tac pharmacokinetics and 
      the remission rate was investigated. RESULTS: Of the 45 subjects, 24 (53.3%) were
      CYP3A5 expressers (Exp), and 21 (46.7%) were non-expressers (Non-Exp). The trough
      level and the dose-adjusted trough level on days 2-5 were significantly higher in
      the Non-Exp group than in the Exp group (10.16 +/- 5.84 vs 4.47 +/- 2.50 ng/mL, P
      < 0.0001, 139.36 +/- 77.43 vs 61.37 +/- 41.55 ng/mL per mg/kg/day, P < 0.0001).
      The percentage of patients achieving the optimal trough level on days 2-5 was
      significantly higher in the Non-Exp group than in the Exp group (40.0% vs 4.3%, P
      = 0.01). This trend was also observed on days 7-10. On multivariate analysis,
      factors associated with achievement of the optimal trough level were food
      non-intake and Non-Exp of CYP3A5. The remission rate was significantly higher in 
      the Non-Exp group than in the Exp group (47.6% vs 16.7%, P = 0.046). CONCLUSIONS:
      CYP3A5 genetic polymorphisms affected the pharmacokinetics of Tac, so that the
      short-term clinical remission rate was different between Exp and Non-Exp of
      CYP3A5.

TI  - A decrease of the butyrate-producing species Roseburia hominis and
      Faecalibacterium prausnitzii defines dysbiosis in patients with ulcerative
      colitis.
PG  - 1275-83
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2013-304833 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacteria play an important role in the onset and perpetuation of
      intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Unlike in Crohn's
      disease (CD), in which dysbiosis has been better characterised, in ulcerative
      colitis (UC), only small cohorts have been studied and showed conflicting data.
      Therefore, we evaluated in a large cohort if the microbial signature described in
      CD is also present in UC, and if we could characterise predominant dysbiosis in
      UC. To assess the functional impact of dysbiosis, we quantified the bacterial
      metabolites. DESIGN: The predominant microbiota from 127 UC patients and 87 age
      and sex-matched controls was analysed using denaturing gradient gel
      electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis. Differences were quantitatively validated using 
      real-time PCR. Metabolites were quantified using gas chromatography-mass
      spectrometry. RESULTS: Based on DGGE analysis, the microbial signature previously
      described in CD was not present in UC. Real-time PCR analysis revealed a lower
      abundance of Roseburia hominis (p<0.0001) and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii
      (p<0.0001) in UC patients compared to controls. Both species showed an inverse
      correlation with disease activity. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) were reduced in
      UC patients (p=0.014), but no direct correlation between SCFA and the identified 
      bacteria was found. CONCLUSIONS: The composition of the fecal microbiota of UC
      patients differs from that of healthy individuals: we found a reduction in R
      hominis and F prausnitzii, both well-known butyrate-producing bacteria of the
      Firmicutes phylum. These results underscore the importance of dysbiosis in IBD
      but suggest that different bacterial species contribute to the pathogenesis of UC
      and CD.

TI  - In vitro batch cultures of gut microbiota from healthy and ulcerative colitis

AB  - Imbalances in gut microbiota composition during ulcerative colitis (UC) indicate 
      a role for the microbiota in propagating the disorder. Such effects were
      investigated using in vitro batch cultures (with/without mucin, peptone or
      starch) inoculated with faecal slurries from healthy or UC patients; the growth
      of five bacterial groups was monitored along with short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)
      production. Healthy cultures gave two-fold higher growth and SCFA levels with up 
      to ten-fold higher butyrate production. Starch gave the highest growth and SCFA
      production (particularly butyrate), indicating starch-enhanced saccharolytic
      activity. Sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) were the predominant bacterial group
      (of five examined) for UC inocula whereas they were the minority group for the
      healthy inocula. Furthermore, SRB growth was stimulated by peptone presumably due
      to the presence of sulphur-rich amino acids. The results suggest raised SRB
      levels in UC, which could contribute to the condition through release of toxic
      sulphide.

AB  - The gut mucosal immune system is considered to play an important role in
      counteracting potential adverse effects of food-derived antigens including
      nanovesicles. Whether nanovesicles naturally released from edible fruit work in a
      coordinated manner with gut immune cells to maintain the gut in a noninflammatory
      status is not known. Here, as proof of concept, we demonstrate that
      grapefruit-derived nanovesicles (GDNs) are selectively taken up by intestinal
      macrophages and ameliorate dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced mouse colitis.
      These effects were mediated by upregulating the expression of heme oxygenase-1
      (HO-1) and inhibiting the production of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha in intestinal
      macrophages. The inherent biocompatibility and biodegradability, stability at
      wide ranges of pH values, and targeting of intestinal macrophages led us to
      further develop a novel GDN-based oral delivery system. Incorporating
      methotrexate (MTX), an anti-inflammatory drug, into GDNs and delivering the
      MTX-GDNs to mice significantly lowered the MTX toxicity when compared with free
      MTX, and remarkably increased its therapeutic effects in DSS-induced mouse
      colitis. These findings demonstrate that GDNs can serve as immune modulators in
      the intestine, maintain intestinal macrophage homeostasis, and can be developed
      for oral delivery of small molecule drugs to attenuate inflammatory responses in 
      human disease.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dietary fats influence intestinal inflammation and regulate mucosal
      immunity. Data on the association between dietary fat and risk of Crohn's disease
      (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are limited and conflicting. METHODS: We
      conducted a prospective study of women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study
      cohorts. Diet was prospectively ascertained every 4 years using a validated
      semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Self-reported CD and UC were
      confirmed through medical record review. We examined the effect of
      energy-adjusted cumulative average total fat intake and specific types of fat and
      fatty acids on the risk of CD and UC using Cox proportional hazards models
      adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: Among 170,805 women, we confirmed
      269 incident cases of CD (incidence 8/100,000 person-years) and 338 incident
      cases of UC (incidence 10/100,000 person-years) over 26 years and 3,317,338
      person-years of follow-up. Cumulative energy-adjusted intake of total fat,
      saturated fats, unsaturated fats, n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)
      were not associated with risk of CD or UC. However, greater intake of long-chain 
      n-3 PUFAs was associated with a trend towards lower risk of UC (HR 0.72, 95% CI
      0.51 to 1.01). In contrast, high long-term intake of trans-unsaturated fatty
      acids was associated with a trend towards an increased incidence of UC (HR 1.34, 
      95% CI 0.94 to 1.92). CONCLUSIONS: A high intake of dietary long-chain n-3 PUFAs 
      may be associated with a reduced risk of UC. In contrast, high intake of
      trans-unsaturated fats may be associated with an increased risk of UC.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease: etiology, pathogenesis and current therapy.
PG  - 1082-96
AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) constitute the two major groups 
      of idiopathic disorders in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Environmental
      factors, genetic factors and immune responses have been considered as the major
      etiology of IBD. Despite the diversified pathogenesis of the disease, no
      guaranteed curative therapeutic regimen has been developed so far. This review
      summarizes the knowledge on the pathophysiology and current treatment approaches 
      of IBD. Since IBD is caused by excessive and tissue- disruptive inflammatory
      reactions of the gut wall, down-regulation of the immune responses may allow the 
      damaged mucosa to heal and reset the physiological functions of the gut back to
      normal. Current pharmacotherapy through modulation of neutrophil-derived factors,
      cytokines, adhesion molecules and reactive oxygen/nitrogen metabolites has been
      utterly described. Categories of treatment modalities include corticosteroids,
      aminosalicylates, immunomodulators, antibiotics, probiotics, and a series of
      unique novel agents. The use of anti-tumor necrosis factor monoclonal antibody
      (Infliximab), recombinant anti-inflammatory cytokines and related gene therapy
      has been covered. In addition, discussions on dietary supplementation and heparin
      treatment are also included. The anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory potential
      of investigational agents such as nicotine and the filtered protective compounds 
      from tobacco smoke, as well as active herbal medicinal compounds were tested in
      our previous experimental works, whereas promising findings have been presented
      here. With the discovery of novel target-oriented agents, more effective and
      relatively harmless approaches of IBD therapy could be established to achieve a
      curative outcome. Indeed, more experimental and clinical studies are needed to
      confirm the relevance of these therapies.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and relapsing inflammatory
      condition of the gastrointestinal tract. The two main forms of IBD are Crohn's
      disease and ulcerative colitis. According to the recent concept the disease is
      caused by a combination of factors, including genetics, immune dysregulation,
      barrier dysfunction and the change in microbial flora. Environmental factors,
      such as changes in diet, antibiotic use, smoking or improved domestic hygiene
      (e.g. eradication of intestinal helminths) probably contribute to the development
      and increased prevalence of IBD. Dysregulation of mucosal immunity in IBD causes 
      an overproduction of inflammatory cytokines which resulted in uncontrolled
      intestinal inflammation. Based on extensive research over the last decade,
      besides the conventional therapy, there are several novel pathways and specific
      targets, on which focus new therapeutics. New therapeutics aim 1./ to correct
      genetic susceptibility by stimulating NOD2 expression, TLR3 signaling or
      inhibition of TLR4 pathway, 2./ to restore the immune dysregulation by inhibition
      of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-13, IL-17, IL-18, IL-21), Th1 
      polarisation (IL-2, IL-12, IL-23, IFN-gamma ), T-cell activation, leukocyte
      adhesion, as well as by immunostimulation (GM-CSF, G-CSF) and anti-inflammatory
      cytokines (IL-10, IL-11, IFN-beta-1a), 3./ to restore mucosal barrier function
      and stimulate mucosal healing by different growth factors, such as GH, EGF, KGF, 
      TGF-beta, VEGF, 4./ to restore the normal bacterial flora by antibiotics,
      probiotics. However, in spite of these numerous potential targets, the true value
      and clinical significance of most of the new biologics and molecules are not
      clear yet.

PG  - 1149-55
AB  - A growing body of experimental and clinical evidence supports the hypothesis that
      the intestinal microbiota markedly influences function and the structure of the
      mucosal lining. Intestinal microbiota can potentially cause damage to the mucosa 
      either directly by releasing toxins or indirectly by causing a detrimental immune
      response. Probiotic bacteria have been defined as live microorganisms, which when
      consumed in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit for the host. In recent
      years, the therapeutic and preventive application of probiotics for several
      gastrointestinal and liver disorders has received increasing attention.
      Probiotics appear to be beneficial for premature infants who suffer necrotizing
      enterocolitis. The effectiveness of certain probiotics as treatment for
      infectious and antibioticassociated diarrhea in adults and for allergic disorders
      in children has been supported by clinical studies; however, the potential
      mechanism( s) remains to be studied. Experimental studies and clinical trials for
      probiotic treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have yielded conflicting
      results. Daily intake of selected probiotics was effective in the prevention of
      ulcerative colitis and the attenuation of the active onset of Crohn's disease or 
      ulcerative colitis but others failed to show a beneficial effect. The combination
      of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces boulardi and the treatment with 
      Escherichia coli Nissle were found beneficial in inducing and maintaining
      remission of disease activity of gut inflammation and moderately severe
      ulcerative colitis. Probiotic bacteria were considered in some studies as a safe 
      adjuvant when added to triple eradication therapy against the symptoms induced by
      the major gastric pathogen, Helicobacter pylori. This review attempted to
      overview these new exciting advances in the role of these microbes in the
      pathogenesis, management and treatment of gastrointestinal disorders.

AB  - Approaches for management of Clostridium difficile infection continually evolve
      as research reveals shifts in epidemiology, microbial pathogenesis, disease
      severity states, and response to therapy. These new discoveries significantly
      impact diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, given the high morbidity associated
      with this common nosocomial infectious diarrhea. Critically ill patients are at
      an increased risk of developing diarrheal illness like C. difficile and
      succumbing to potentially fatal complications of this infection. Early diagnosis 
      of severe disease state may improve patient outcomes. In this article, we review 
      treatment strategies and new approaches for the management of C. difficile in
      critically ill patients.

TI  - Lactobacillus GG-fermented milk prevents DSS-induced colitis and regulates
      intestinal epithelial homeostasis through activation of epidermal growth factor
      receptor.
PG  - 105-15
LID - 10.1007/s00394-013-0506-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fermented milk is considered one of the best sources for efficient
      consumption of probiotic strains by hosts to promote good health. The purpose of 
      this study was to investigate the effects of orally administering LGG-fermented
      milk (LGG milk) on intestinal inflammation and injury and to study the mechanisms
      of LGG milk's action. METHODS: LGG milk and non-LGG-fermented milk (non-LGG milk)
      were administered through gavage to mice before and during dextran sodium sulfate
      (DSS)-induced intestinal injury and colitis. Inflammatory/injury score and colon 
      length were assessed. Intestinal epithelial cells were treated with the soluble
      fraction of LGG milk to detect its effects on the epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR) and its downstream target, Akt activation, cytokine-induced
      apoptosis, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced disruption of tight junctions.
      RESULTS: LGG milk treatment significantly reduced DSS-induced colonic
      inflammation and injury, and colon shortening in mice, compared to that in
      non-LGG milk-treated and -untreated mice. The soluble fraction of LGG milk, but
      not non-LGG milk, stimulated the activation of EGFR and Akt in a
      concentration-dependent manner, suppressed cytokine-induced apoptosis, and
      attenuated H2O2-induced disruption of tight junction complex in the intestinal
      epithelial cells. These effects of LGG milk were blocked by the EGFR kinase
      inhibitor. LGG milk, but not non-LGG milk, contained two soluble proteins, p40
      and p75, that have been reported to promote survival and growth of intestinal
      epithelial cells through the activation of EGFR. Depletion of p40 and p75 from
      LGG milk abolished the effects of LGG milk on prevention of cytokine-induced
      apoptosis and H2O2-induced disruption of tight junctions. CONCLUSIONS: These
      results suggest that LGG milk may regulate intestinal epithelial homeostasis and 
      potentially prevent intestinal inflammatory diseases through activation of EGFR
      by LGG-derived proteins.

TI  - Clostridium difficile colitis: review of the therapeutic approach.
PG  - 385-94
LID - 10.1097/MJT.0b013e318245992d [doi]
AB  - Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the leading cause of
      antibiotic-associated and nosocomial infectious diarrhea. Presenting as
      clostridium difficile colitis, it is a significant cause of morbidity and
      mortality. Metronidazole is regarded as the agent of choice for CDl therapy and
      also for the first recurrence in most patients with mild to moderate CDI.
      Vancomycin is recommended as an initial therapy for patients with severe CDI.
      With recent Food and Drug Administration-approval fidaxomicin is available for
      clinical use and is as effective as vancomycin with lower relapse rates.
      Rifaximin and fecal bacteriotherapy are alternative approaches in patients with
      severe or refractory CDI, before surgical intervention. Antibiotic research is
      ongoing to add potential new drugs such as teicoplanin, ramoplanin, fusidic acid,
      nitazoxanide, rifampin, bacitracin to our armamentarium. Role of toxin-binding
      agents is still questionable. Monoclonal antibody and intravenous immunoglobulin 
      are still investigational therapies that could be promising options. The ongoing 
      challenges in the treatment of CDI include management of recurrence and presence 
      of resistance strains such as NAP1/BI/027, but early recognition of surgical
      candidates can potentially decrease mortality in CDI.
