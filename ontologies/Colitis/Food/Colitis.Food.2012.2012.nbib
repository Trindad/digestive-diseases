TI  - Nutrition in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease: is it useful for prevention
      and therapy?
PG  - 983-90
AB  - Countless studies aiming to discover the cause and cure of inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) have been conducted over the years world-wide. Food nutrients were 
      believed to play a certain role in the causation of the disease, in conjunction
      with genetic, immunologic, environmental and other factors (especially intestinal
      microbiota). Various nutrients were found to be involved, sometimes with
      controversial results, possibly pertaining to geographic regions. Nutrition has
      to be especially considered in children as disease itself and/or the medication
      can severely impair normal growth and development, sometimes with permanent
      long-term sequels. We reviewed the data on the possible roles of diet in
      preventing the disease and relapses. We emphasize the crucial importance of
      enteral nutrition in inducing and maintaining the remission of Crohn's disease,
      according to the existing consensuses (benefits, indications, routes of
      administration, types of formula, duration, results). We also present data on
      parenteral nutrition in pediatric IBD, with current updates from literature.

TI  - Innate immunity modulation by the IL-33/ST2 system in intestinal mucosa.
PG  - 142492
LID - 10.1155/2013/142492 [doi]
AB  - Innate immunity prevents pathogens from entering and spreading within the body.
      This function is especially important in the gastrointestinal tract and skin, as 
      these organs have a large surface contact area with the outside environment. In
      the intestine, luminal commensal bacteria are necessary for adequate food
      digestion and play a crucial role in tolerance to benign antigens. Immune system 
      damage can create an intestinal inflammatory response, leading to chronic disease
      including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an IBD of
      unknown etiology with increasing worldwide prevalence. In the intestinal mucosa
      of UC patients, there is an imbalance in the IL-33/ST2 axis, an important
      modulator of the innate immune response. This paper reviews the role of the
      IL-33/ST2 system in innate immunity of the intestinal mucosa and its importance
      in inflammatory bowel diseases, especially ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Anti-inflammatory Lactobacillus rhamnosus CNCM I-3690 strain protects against
      oxidative stress and increases lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans.
PG  - e52493
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0052493 [doi]
AB  - Numerous studies have shown that resistance to oxidative stress is crucial to
      stay healthy and to reduce the adverse effects of aging. Accordingly, nutritional
      interventions using antioxidant food-grade compounds or food products are
      currently an interesting option to help improve health and quality of life in the
      elderly. Live lactic acid bacteria (LAB) administered in food, such as
      probiotics, may be good antioxidant candidates. Nevertheless, information about
      LAB-induced oxidative stress protection is scarce. To identify and characterize
      new potential antioxidant probiotic strains, we have developed a new functional
      screening method using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as host. C. elegans
      were fed on different LAB strains (78 in total) and nematode viability was
      assessed after oxidative stress (3 mM and 5 mM H(2)O(2)). One strain, identified 
      as Lactobacillus rhamnosus CNCM I-3690, protected worms by increasing their
      viability by 30% and, also, increased average worm lifespan by 20%. Moreover,
      transcriptomic analysis of C. elegans fed with this strain showed that increased 
      lifespan is correlated with differential expression of the DAF-16/insulin-like
      pathway, which is highly conserved in humans. This strain also had a clear
      anti-inflammatory profile when co-cultured with HT-29 cells, stimulated by
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, and co-culture systems with HT-29 cells and DC in the
      presence of LPS. Finally, this Lactobacillus strain reduced inflammation in a
      murine model of colitis. This work suggests that C. elegans is a fast, predictive
      and convenient screening tool to identify new potential antioxidant probiotic
      strains for subsequent use in humans.

      farms].
PG  - 312-23
AB  - Verocytotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC) is associated with outbreaks and
      sporadic cases of hemorrhagic colitis (HC) and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS),
      the most severe form of these human diseases. In Argentina HUS is endemic, with
      500 new cases per year and an incidence of 17/100,000 in children under 5 years
      of age. VTEC O157:H7 is the most frequently isolated serotype, although there are
      non-O157 serotypes that have been associated with human disease. VTEC produces
      verocytotoxins and accessory virulence factors such as intimin, an
      enterohemolysin and an autoagglutinating protein called Saa. Cattle are VTEC
      carriers and several studies in Argentina have confirmed that bovines are the
      main reservoir of serotypes O157:H7 and non-O157, many of them involved in HUS
      and HC worldwide. Transmission of VTEC to humans occurs through consumption of
      undercooked meat, vegetables and water contaminated by feces of carriers,
      person-to-person and contaminated environment contact. Dairy farms can contribute
      to the risk of VTEC infection in humans through the consumption of raw milk,
      dairy products, and contaminated meat from dairy cattle and through contamination
      of the dairy environment. There is wide distribution and high prevalence of VTEC 
      serotypes in dairy cattle in Argentina; therefore, it is important to improve the
      measures of control and management and to prevent the transmission of VTEC
      strains among animals, environment and humans.

PG  - 1745-52
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2012-303611 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Many species within the phylum Firmicutes are thought to exert
      anti-inflammatory effects. We quantified bacteria belonging to the genus
      Butyricicoccus in stools of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's
      disease (CD). We evaluated the effect of Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum in a rat
      colitis model and analysed the ability to prevent cytokine-induced increases in
      epithelial permeability. DESIGN: A genus-specific quantitative PCR was used for
      quantification of Butyricicoccus in stools from patients with UC or CD and
      healthy subjects. The effect of B pullicaecorum on trinitrobenzenesulfonic
      (TNBS)-induced colitis was assessed and the effect of B pullicaecorum culture
      supernatant on epithelial barrier function was investigated in vitro. RESULTS:
      The average number of Butyricicoccus in stools from patients with UC and CD in
      active (UC: 8.61 log10/g stool; CD: 6.58 log10/g stool) and remission phase (UC: 
      8.69 log10/g stool; CD: 8.38 log10/g stool) was significantly lower compared with
      healthy subjects (9.32 log10/g stool) and correlated with disease activity in CD.
      Oral administration of B pullicaecorum resulted in a significant protective
      effect based on macroscopic and histological criteria and decreased intestinal
      myeloperoxidase (MPO), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin
      (IL)-12 levels. Supernatant of B pullicaecorum prevented the loss of
      transepithelial resistance (TER) and the increase in IL-8 secretion induced by
      TNFalpha and interferon gamma (IFN gamma) in a Caco-2 cell model. CONCLUSIONS:
      Patients with inflammatory bowel disease have lower numbers of Butyricicoccus
      bacteria in their stools. Administration of B pullicaecorum attenuates
      TNBS-induced colitis in rats and supernatant of B pullicaecorum cultures
      strengthens the epithelial barrier function by increasing the TER.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of probiotics in
      various areas of gastrointestinal (GI) health. Probiotics are defined as live
      microorganisms that provide beneficial health effects on the host when
      administered in adequate amounts. Various probiotics have been shown to suppress 
      bacterial growth, modulate the immune system and improve intestinal barrier
      function. However, despite several studies with promising results, most trials
      are small and many have substantial methodological limitations. However, with
      better targeting and appropriate randomised controlled trials, this area may soon
      yield important therapeutic strategies to optimise GI health. Here, we review the
      current knowledge of probiotics of relevance to luminal GI health.

AB  - Since the 1980s, EnterohaemorrhagicEscherichia coli (EHEC) have been recognised
      as emergent pathogens causing foodborne outbreaks. The latest one is the E. coli 
      O104:H4 outbreak which occurred in Germany in May 2011 then in France. In France,
      the surveillance of EHEC infections is based on surveillance of hemolytic-uremic 
      syndrome (HUS) in children under 15 years old. The average annual incidence is
      0.8/100,000 children under 15 years old with a predominance of the O157:H7
      serotype. EHEC are one of the six clinical pathovars of E. coli defined by their 
      capacity to produce Shiga-toxins and for that reason, are part of a larger group 
      called: Shigatoxin-producingE. coli (STEC). EHEC are a cause of different
      troubles ranging from mild diarrhea to haemorrhagic colitis which might be
      complicated by HUS in young children and thrombocytopenic thrombotic purpura in
      adults. The reservoir of EHEC is mainly the intestinal tract of ruminants: EHEC
      are transmitted via ingestion of contaminated food or water, person-to-person
      contact, direct animal contact and exposure to the environment. The diagnosis of 
      the EHEC infections relies on isolation of STEC in stool samples or detection of 
      genes encoding for Shiga-toxins. Treatment is mainly symptomatic. Use of
      antibiotics is controversial because the risk of HUS could be increased (release 
      of toxins).

TI  - Expression and release of leptin and proinflammatory cytokines in patients with
      ulcerative colitis and infectious diarrhea.
PG  - 471-81
AB  - Leptin plays not only an important role in regulation of food intake, but also in
      the mechanism of inflammation. The universal presence of leptin in the cells of
      immune system and its secretion by these cells caused increasing interest in the 
      role of this hormone in ulcerative colitis (UC). We determined the role of leptin
      in 80 patients, aged from 18 to 69 years, including 50 patients with active UC
      and 30 patients with infectious diarrhea. The tests were performed within 48
      hours of the first symptoms, in the period of remission of UC and 8 weeks after
      resolution of infectious diarrhea. Endoscopy was performed in each patient, and
      the biopsy samples were taken for the assessments of expression of mRNA for
      leptin, IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha by RT-PCR and Western blot. Blood tests
      included concentrations of leptin, IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha. In addition, the
      plasma levels of leptin, IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha were assessed by ELISA.
      Serum concentrations of leptin was significantly increased in patients with
      exacerbation of UC over that in patients with UC in remission. The serum leptin
      concentration was significantly higher in patients with infectious diarrhea, than
      the patients that recovered from infectious diarrhea. The leptin protein was
      overexpressed in the biopsy samples of the mucosa of large intestine compared to 
      those with exacerbation of UC, and in patients after successful recovery from
      infectious diarrhea. The leptin mRNA was overexpressed in patients with
      infectious diarrhea compared with that in the group of patients after successful 
      recovery from this condition. Serum concentrations of leptin failed to correlate 
      with severity of exacerbation of UC and with extent of intestinal inflammatory
      lesions in patients with UC. However, the correlation was observed between serum 
      concentrations of leptin in patients with exacerbation of UC and serum
      concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and TNF-alpha. We conclude
      that 1) the increased leptin in exacerbated UC is related to the increased serum 
      proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels; 2) In patients
      with infectious diarrhea, the concentrations of leptin in intestinal mucosa
      correlates with serum concentrations of cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha
      and with an increased expression of leptin mRNA in intestinal mucosa but not with
      alterations in serum levels of this hormone; 3) leptin may serve as useful
      predictive marker of inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

PG  - 1261-87
LID - 10.3390/toxins4111261 [doi]
AB  - Food-borne diseases are estimated at 76 million illnesses and 5000 deaths every
      year in the United States with the greatest burden on young children, the elderly
      and immunocompromised populations. The impact of efficient food distribution
      systems and a truly global food supply ensures that outbreaks, previously
      sporadic and contained locally, are far more widespread and emerging pathogens
      have far more frequent infection opportunities. Enterohemorrhagic E. coli is an
      emerging food- and water-borne pathogen family whose Shiga-like toxins induce
      painful hemorrhagic colitis with potentially lethal complications of hemolytic
      uremic syndrome (HUS). The clinical manifestations of Shiga toxin-induced HUS
      overlap with other related syndromes yet molecular mechanisms differ
      considerably. As discussed herein, understanding these differences and the novel 
      properties of the toxins is imperative for clinical management decisions, design 
      of appropriate animal models, and choices of adjunctive therapeutics. The
      emergence of new strains with rapidly aggressive virulence makes clinical and
      research initiatives in this field a high public health priority.

TI  - DHA-enriched fish oil targets B cell lipid microdomains and enhances ex vivo and 
      in vivo B cell function.
PG  - 463-70
LID - 10.1189/jlb.0812394 [doi]
AB  - DHA is a n-3 LCPUFA in fish oil that generally suppresses T lymphocyte function. 
      However, the effect of fish oil on B cell function remains relatively
      understudied. Given the important role of B cells in gut immunity and increasing 
      human fish oil supplementation, we sought to determine whether DFO leads to
      enhanced B cell activation in the SMAD-/- colitis-prone mouse model, similar to
      that observed with C57BL/6 mice. This study tested the hypothesis that DHA from
      fish oil is incorporated into the B cell membrane to alter lipid microdomain
      clustering and enhance B cell function. Purified, splenic B cells from DFO-fed
      mice displayed increased DHA levels and diminished GM1 microdomain clustering.
      DFO enhanced LPS-induced B cell secretion of IL-6 and TNF-alpha and increased
      CD40 expression ex vivo compared with CON. Despite increased MHCII expression in 
      the unstimulated ex vivo B cells from DFO-fed mice, we observed no difference in 
      ex vivo OVA-FITC uptake in B cells from DFO or CON mice. In vivo, DFO increased
      lymphoid tissue B cell populations and surface markers of activation compared
      with CON. Finally, we investigated whether these ex vivo and in vivo observations
      were consistent with systemic changes. Indeed, DFO-fed mice had significantly
      higher plasma IL-5, IL-13, and IL-9 (Th2-biasing cytokines) and cecal IgA
      compared with CON. These results support the hypothesis and an emerging concept
      that fish oil enhances B cell function in vivo.

TI  - [Quantity of Desulfovibrios and analysis of intestinal microbiota diversity in
      health and intestinal disease people in Wuxi, Jiangsu province].
PG  - 1033-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This paper provides an overview of Desulfovibrio (DSV) incidence and
      its effect on bacterial diversity in human gastrointestinal tract of four groups:
      ulcerative colitis (UC), colorectal cancer (CRC), polypus (PP) and the healthy
      control (H). METHODS: Real time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) assays
      were used to enumerate DSV in gastrointestinal tract of 58 subjects. Diversity of
      gut microbiota was analyzed by PCR-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis
      (PCR-DGGE) and 16S rRNA V3 sequencing. RESULTS: RT-PCR detected DSV in all
      samples. Significantly increased numbers of DSV were observed for UC and PP
      groups compared with CRC and H groups. No significant difference was observed for
      CRC and H groups with gene copy numbers of DSV. Alterations of DSV and gut
      microbiota were observed in disease groups. CONCLUSION: We found that quantity
      and diversity of DSV are significantly increased in UC and PP compared to
      controls. The increased numbers of DSV in disease groups suggests a possible
      harmful role.

AB  - Escherichia coli O157:H7 is a notorious pathogen often contracted by intake of
      contaminated water or food. Infection with this agent is associated with a broad 
      spectrum of illness ranging from mild diarrhea and hemorrhagic colitis to the
      potentially fatal hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Treating E. coli O157:H7
      infection with antimicrobial agents is associated with an increased risk of
      severe sequelae such as HUS. The difficulty in treating this bacterium using
      conventional modalities of antimicrobial agent administration has sparked an
      interest in investigating new therapeutic approaches to this bacterium. These
      approaches have included the use of probiotic agents and natural products with
      variable success rates. In addition, novel modalities and regimen of
      antimicrobial agent administration have been assessed in an attempt at decreasing
      their association with aggravating infection outcomes.

TI  - Reduced bone breakage and increased bone strength in free range laying hens fed
      omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplemented diets.
PG  - 578-86
LID - 10.1016/j.bone.2012.11.003 [doi]
LID - S8756-3282(12)01345-2 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are the
      immediate precursors to a number of important mediators of immunity, inflammation
      and bone function, with products of omega-6 generally thought to promote
      inflammation and favour bone resorption. Western diets generally provide a 10 to 
      20-fold deficit in omega-3 PUFAs compared with omega-6, and this is thought to
      have contributed to the marked rise in incidence of disorders of modern human
      societies, such as heart disease, colitis and perhaps osteoporosis. Many of our
      food production animals, fed on grains rich in omega-6, are also exposed to a
      dietary deficit in omega-3, with perhaps similar health consequences. Bone
      fragility due to osteoporotic changes in laying hens is a major economic and
      welfare problem, with our recent estimates of breakage rates indicating up to 95%
      of free range hens suffer breaks during lay. METHODS: Free range hens housed in
      full scale commercial systems were provided diets supplemented with omega-3 alpha
      linolenic acid, and the skeletal benefits were investigated by comparison to
      standard diets rich in omega-6. RESULTS: There was a significant 40-60% reduction
      in keel bone breakage rate, and a corresponding reduction in breakage severity in
      the omega-3 supplemented hens. There was significantly greater bone density and
      bone mineral content, alongside increases in total bone and trabecular volumes.
      The mechanical properties of the omega-3 supplemented hens were improved, with
      strength, energy to break and stiffness demonstrating significant increases.
      Alkaline phosphatase (an osteoblast marker) and tartrate-resistant acid
      phosphatase (an osteoclast marker) both showed significant increases with the
      omega-3 diets, indicating enhanced bone turnover. This was corroborated by the
      significantly lower levels of the mature collagen crosslinks, hydroxylysyl
      pyridinoline, lysyl pyridinoline and histidinohydroxy-lysinonorleucine, with a
      corresponding significant shift in the mature:immature crosslink ratio.
      CONCLUSIONS: The improved skeletal health in laying hens corresponds to as many
      as 68million fewer hens suffering keel fractures in the EU each year. The
      biomechanical and biochemical evidence suggests that increased bone turnover has 
      enhanced the bone mechanical properties, and that this may suggest potential
      benefits for human osteoporosis.

AB  - Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders or eosinophilic digestive disorders
      encompass a spectrum of rare gastrointestinal disorders that includes
      eosinophilic esophagitis, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, and eosinophilic colitis.
      Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is a rare inflammatory disease characterized by
      eosinophilic infiltration of the gastrointestinal tract. The clinical
      manifestations include anemia, dyspepsia, and diarrhea. Endoscopy with biopsy
      showing histologic evidence of eosinophilic infiltration is considered definitive
      for diagnosis. Corticosteroid therapy, food allergen testing, elimination diets, 
      and elemental diets are considered effective treatments for eosinophilic
      gastroenteritis. The treatment and prognosis of eosinophilic gastroenteritis is
      determined by the severity of the clinical manifestations. We describe a
      24-year-old woman with eosinophilic gastroenteritis presenting as epigastric pain
      with a history of severe iron deficiency anemia, asthma, eczema, and allergic
      rhinitis, and we review the literature regarding presentation, diagnostic
      testing, pathophysiology, predisposing factors, and treatment recommendations.

TI  - Stenting of stenotic mesenteric arteries for symptomatic chronic mesenteric
      ischemia.
PG  - 425-31
LID - 10.1024/0301-1526/a000232 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We report the results of our single center series of patients with
      chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) to determine the role of stenting in the
      management of patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all
      patients with CMI treated endovascularly with stent revascularisation from
      January 2008 to January 2011.CMI diagnosis was made according to clinical
      symptoms, including postprandial abdominal pain, food fear, and weight loss.
      Additionally, the diagnosis was confirmed by duplex ultrasonography and/or
      computed tomography angiography and/or contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance
      angiography. RESULTS: All 45 patients presented with typical CMI symptoms: 45/45 
      (100 %) had postprandial pain, 31/45 (68.8 %) had a weight loss of more than 10
      kilograms, and 11/45 (24.4 %) suffered from ischemic colitis combined with lower 
      gastrointestinal bleeding. In three patients occlusion could not be crossed,
      therefore considered as technical failure. A total of 55 arteries were stented in
      the remaining 42 patients. Nineteen patients underwent SMA stenting alone, eight 
      underwent celiac stenting, alone and three patients underwent stenting of
      inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) alone. We performed combined stenting of the
      celiac artery and superior mesenteric artery in ten patients, and one patient
      underwent a combined stenting of the celiac artery and the IMA. All three
      mesenteric arteries were stented in only one patient. Primary technical success
      was achieved in 42/45 (94.8 %) patients. Clinical symptom relief was achieved in 
      39/45 (86.6 %) patients with abdominal pain. Increased body weight was observed
      in 28/31 (90.3 %) patients with an average weight gain of 8.8 kilograms (5 - 12
      kilograms), and 10/11 (90.9 %) patients recovered from ischaemic colitis/lower
      gastrointestinal bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Stent revascularisation can be considered
      as the first-line therapy for patients with chronic mesenteric ischemia.

TI  - Mushroom Ganoderma lucidum prevents colitis-associated carcinogenesis in mice.
PG  - e47873
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0047873 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies suggest that mushroom intake is inversely
      correlated with gastric, gastrointestinal and breast cancers. We have recently
      demonstrated anticancer and anti-inflammatory activity of triterpene extract
      isolated from mushroom Ganoderma lucidum (GLT). The aim of the present study was 
      to evaluate whether GLT prevents colitis-associated carcinogenesis in mice.
      METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Colon carcinogenesis was induced by the food-borne
      carcinogen (2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazol[4,5-b]pyridine [PhIP]) and
      inflammation (dextran sodium sulfate [DSS]) in mice. Mice were treated with 0,
      100, 300 and 500 mg GLT/kg of body weight 3 times per week for 4 months. Cell
      proliferation, expression of cyclin D1 and COX-2 and macrophage infiltration was 
      assessed by immunohistochemistry. The effect of GLT on XRE/AhR, PXR and rPXR was 
      evaluated by the reporter gene assays. Expression of metabolizing enzymes CYP1A2,
      CYP3A1 and CYP3A4 in colon tissue was determined by immunohistochemistry. GLT
      treatment significantly suppressed focal hyperplasia, aberrant crypt foci (ACF)
      formation and tumor formation in mice exposed to PhIP/DSS. The anti-proliferative
      effects of GLT were further confirmed by the decreased staining with Ki-67 in
      colon tissues. PhIP/DSS-induced colon inflammation was demonstrated by the
      significant shortening of the large intestine and macrophage infiltrations,
      whereas GLT treatment prevented the shortening of colon lengths, and reduced
      infiltration of macrophages in colon tissue. GLT treatment also significantly
      down-regulated PhIP/DSS-dependent expression of cyclin D1, COX-2, CYP1A2 and
      CYP3A4 in colon tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that GLT could be
      considered as an alternative dietary approach for the prevention of
      colitis-associated cancer.

PG  - 5573-85
LID - 10.1021/pr300637d [doi]
AB  - Microbial metabolism of proteins and amino acids by human gut bacteria generates 
      a variety of compounds including phenol, indole, and sulfur compounds and
      branched chain fatty acids, many of which have been shown to elicit a toxic
      effect on the lumen. Bacterial fermentation of amino acids and proteins occurs
      mainly in the distal colon, a site that is often fraught with symptoms from
      disorders including ulcerative colitis (UC) and colorectal cancer (CRC). In
      contrast to carbohydrate metabolism by the gut microbiota, proteolysis is less
      extensively researched. Many metabolites are low molecular weight, volatile
      compounds. This review will summarize the use of analytical methods to detect and
      identify compounds in order to elucidate the relationship between specific
      dietary proteinaceous substrates, their corresponding metabolites, and
      implications for gastrointestinal health.

PG  - 158ra144

AB  - Elafin, a natural protease inhibitor expressed in healthy intestinal mucosa, has 
      pleiotropic anti-inflammatory properties in vitro and in animal models. We found 
      that mucosal expression of Elafin is diminished in patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD). This defect is associated with increased elastolytic
      activity (elastase-like proteolysis) in colon tissue. We engineered two
      food-grade strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to express and deliver Elafin to
      the site of inflammation in the colon to assess the potential therapeutic
      benefits of the Elafin-expressing LAB. In mouse models of acute and chronic
      colitis, oral administration of Elafin-expressing LAB decreased elastolytic
      activity and inflammation and restored intestinal homeostasis. Furthermore, when 
      cultures of human intestinal epithelial cells were treated with LAB secreting
      Elafin, the inflamed epithelium was protected from increased intestinal
      permeability and from the release of cytokines and chemokines, both of which are 
      characteristic of intestinal dysfunction associated with IBD. Together, these
      results suggest that oral delivery of LAB secreting Elafin may be useful for
      treating IBD in humans.

AB  - Definitive curative strategies for inflammatory bowel disease remain challenging 
      for physicians and patients. For decades, probiotic organisms have been used in
      various gastrointestinal diseases. Only recently has comprehension of the
      pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease developed to the point where the
      significance of the host gastrointestinal microbial population is seen to have
      marked influence on the initiation and ongoing inflammatory processes of Crohn
      disease and ulcerative colitis. Well-designed, large randomized controlled trials
      using probiotics in patients with inflammatory bowel disease are required for
      probiotics to become mainstream therapy.

AB  - Clostridium difficile colitis is the most common gastrointestinal infection,
      exceeding all other gastrointestinal infections combined. There has been a
      dramatic increase in Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) worldwide during the
      past decade. Antibiotic therapy is a trigger precipitating antibiotic-associated 
      diarrhea (AAD), which may lead to CDI. The antibiotic alters the protective,
      diverse bacteria allowing pathogenic bacteria to cause disease. Probiotics have
      been effective in reducing AAD and preventing CDI.

PG  - 198-201
LID - 10.3109/08923973.2012.734511 [doi]
AB  - Allergic colitis (AC) typically develops in the first weeks or months of life and
      is characterized by the presence of red blood in the stools of healthy breastfed 
      or formula fed infants. In this paper, we describe a case of rectal bleeding in
      monozygotic preterm twins that was resolved with the introduction of a cow's milk
      protein-free diet (CMPFD). The occurrence of this disorder in monozygotic twins
      raises the question as to whether the underlying abnormality in the immune
      regulation, which leads to poor acquisition of tolerance to cow's milk proteins, 
      might be inherited or environmentally acquired. The case also highlights the use 
      of the probiotic Lactobacillus GG (LGG) in the treatment of allergic colitis.

TI  - The microbiome and inflammatory bowel disease: is there a therapeutic role for
      fecal microbiota transplantation?
PG  - 1452-9
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2012.93 [doi]
AB  - One hypothesis for the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease is that an altered 
      or pathogenic microbiota causes inflammation in a genetically susceptible
      individual. Understanding the microbiota's role in the pathogenesis of the
      disease could lead to new IBD treatments aimed at shifting the bacteria in the
      gut back to eubiosis. Probiotics have some efficacy in the treatment of
      ulcerative colitis (UC), but our current repertoire is limited in potency. Fecal 
      microbiota therapy (FMT) is an emerging treatment for several gastrointestinal
      and metabolic disorders. It has demonstrated efficacy in treating refractory
      Clostridium difficile infection, and there are case reports of FMT successfully
      treating UC. Further clinical studies are justified, and could be complemented by
      mouse models of fecal transplantation, in which variables can be controlled and
      manipulated.

TI  - T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas reported to the FDA AERS with tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors: results of the REFURBISH study.
PG  - 99-105
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2012.334 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) with tumor necrosis factor
      alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors is unclear, whether related to concomitant
      thiopurines usage or due to the underlying inflammatory disease. We sought to
      review all cases of T-cell NHL reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      in patients receiving TNF-alpha inhibitors for all approved indications and
      examine the risk of T-cell NHL with TNF-alpha inhibitors in comparison with the
      use of thiopurines in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: The FDA Adverse 
      Event Reporting System (AERS) was queried for all lymphomas following treatment
      with the following TNF-alpha inhibitors: infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab,
      etanercept, and their trade names. Full reports for T-cell NHL cases were
      identified using the Freedom of Information Act. In addition, T-cell NHL reported
      in patients IBD with the use of the thiopurines-azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine,
      and their trade names were also collected. A search of MEDLINE was performed for 
      additional T-cell NHL with TNF-alpha inhibitors or thiopurines, not reported to
      the FDA but available in published literature. The histological subtypes of
      T-cell NHL reported with TNF-alpha inhibitors were compared with reported
      subtypes in Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) -17 registry.
      Reported risk of T-cell NHL in IBD with TNF-alpha inhibitors, thiopurines, or
      concomitant use was calculated using Fisher's exact test using 5-aminosalicylates
      as control drugs. RESULTS: A total of 3,130,267 reports were downloaded from the 
      FDA AERS (2003-2010). Ninety-one cases of T-cell NHL with TNF-alpha inhibitors
      were identified in the FDA AERS and nine additional cases were identified on
      MEDLINE search. A total of 38 patients had rheumatoid arthritis, 36 cases had
      Crohn's disease, 11 had psoriasis, 9 had ulcerative colitis, and 6 had ankylosing
      spondylitis. Sixty-eight of the cases (68%) involved exposure to both a TNF-alpha
      inhibitor and an immunomodulator (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate,
      leflunomide, or cyclosporine). Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) was the most
      common reported subtype, whereas mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome and HSTCL were
      identified as more common with TNF-alpha-inhibitor exposure compared with SEER-17
      registry. Nineteen cases of T-cell NHL with thiopurines were identified in the
      FDA AERS and one additional case on MEDLINE. Reported risk of T-cell NHL was
      higher with TNF-alpha inhibitor use in combination with thiopurines (95%
      confidence interval (CI) 4.98-354.09; P<0.0001) and thiopurines alone (95% CI
      8.32-945.38; P<0.0001) but not with TNF-alpha inhibitor use alone (95% CI
      0.13-10.61; P=1.00). CONCLUSIONS: Risk of T-cell NHL is increased with TNF-alpha 
      inhibitor use in combination with thiopurines but not with TNF-alpha inhibitors
      alone.

TI  - [Probiotics have a limited role in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease].
PG  - A5206
AB  - Probiotics are frequently prescribed for the treatment of inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). However, supporting evidence for the use of probiotics in IBD is
      scarce. Most studies are limited by design or do not show that probiotic
      treatment is effective. Only a few randomised controlled trials have demonstrated
      any beneficial effect of probiotic use in IBD; namely, the use of VSL#3 in
      patients with pouchitis and ulcerative colitis. So far, the efficacy of
      probiotics in the treatment of Crohn's disease has not been clearly demonstrated.
      Furthermore, issues pertaining to their mechanisms of action, dosages and dosing 
      intervals, safety, and health insurance coverage are currently unresolved. Given 
      the limited body of evidence of their efficacy from controlled trials and the
      many unanswered questions on probiotic treatment, we recommend following the
      evidence obtained from well-designed randomised controlled trials and only
      prescribing probiotic treatment (e.g. VSL #3) for the prevention of pouchitis and
      the treatment of patients with mildly active ulcerative colitis.

AB  - Ginger is a commonly used spice with anti-inflammatory potential. Colitis is the 
      common pathological lesion of inflammatory bowel diseases. In this study, we
      investigated the therapeutic effects of ginger and its component zingerone in
      mice with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis. Ginger and
      zingerone ameliorated TNBS-induced colonic injury in a dose-dependent manner.
      Pathway analysis of ginger- and zingerone-regulated gene expression profiles
      showed that ginger and zingerone significantly regulated cytokine-related
      pathways. Network analysis showed that nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and
      interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) were key molecules involved in the expression of
      ginger- and zingerone-affected genes. Ex vivo imaging and immunohistochemical
      staining further verified that ginger and zingerone suppressed TNBS-induced
      NF-kappaB activation and IL-1beta protein level in the colon. In conclusion,
      ginger improved TNBS-induced colitis via modulation of NF-kappaB activity and
      IL-1beta signalling pathway. Moreover, zingerone might be the active component of
      ginger responsible for the amelioration of colitis induced by TNBS.

TI  - Effect of exclusive enteral nutrition on gut microflora function in children with
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1454-9
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2012.703234 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is a first-line treatment in
      children with active Crohn's disease (CD) but is seldom used in adults with
      active disease. The mode of action of EEN in suppressing mucosal inflammation is 
      not fully understood, but modulation of intestinal microflora activity is one
      possible explanation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of
      6-week EEN in children with active CD, with special reference to intestinal
      microflora function. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fecal samples from 18 children (11
      boys, 7 girls; median age 13.5 years) with active CD (13 children with small
      bowel/colonic and 5 with perianal disease) were analyzed for short chain fatty
      acid (SCFA) pattern as marker of gut microflora function. The children were
      studied before and after EEN treatment. Results from 12 healthy teenagers were
      used for comparison. RESULTS: Eleven (79%) of the children with small
      bowel/colonic CD responded clinically positively to EEN treatment showing
      decreased levels of pro-inflammatory acetic acid as well as increased
      concentrations of anti-inflammatory butyric acids and also of valeric acids,
      similar to the levels in healthy age-matched children. In children with active
      perianal CD, however, EEN had no positive effect on clinical status or
      inflammatory parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The authors present new data supporting the
      hypothesis that the well-documented anti-inflammatory effect of EEN in children
      with active small bowel/colonic CD is brought about by modulation of gut
      microflora activity, resulting in an anti-inflammatory SCFA pattern. By contrast,
      none of the children with perianal disease showed clinical or biochemical
      improvement after EEN treatment.

TI  - Diet-induced dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota and the effects on immunity
      and disease.
PG  - 1095-119
AB  - The gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota is the collection of microbes which reside
      in the GI tract and represents the largest source of non-self antigens in the
      human body. The GI tract functions as a major immunological organ as it must
      maintain tolerance to commensal and dietary antigens while remaining responsive
      to pathogenic stimuli. If this balance is disrupted, inappropriate inflammatory
      processes can result, leading to host cell damage and/or autoimmunity. Evidence
      suggests that the composition of the intestinal microbiota can influence
      susceptibility to chronic disease of the intestinal tract including ulcerative
      colitis, Crohn's disease, celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome, as well as
      more systemic diseases such as obesity, type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes.
      Interestingly, a considerable shift in diet has coincided with increased
      incidence of many of these inflammatory diseases. It was originally believed that
      the composition of the intestinal microbiota was relatively stable from early
      childhood; however, recent evidence suggests that diet can cause dysbiosis, an
      alteration in the composition of the microbiota, which could lead to aberrant
      immune responses. The role of the microbiota and the potential for diet-induced
      dysbiosis in inflammatory conditions of the GI tract and systemic diseases will
      be discussed.

      disease: results of a cross-sectional study in Norway.
PG  - 1436-47
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2012.725092 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the proportion of complementary and alternative medicine 
      (CAM) use in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and to identify
      demographic and clinical factors that are associated with CAM use. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: In this cross-sectional study design, patients with confirmed diagnosis 
      of ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD), and >/=18 years old,
      attending outpatient clinics at 14 hospitals in Norway were eligible to complete 
      questionnaires including demographics, clinical variables, and the International 
      CAM Questionnaire (I-CAM-Q). RESULTS: Of 460 patients included in the study, 430 
      had evaluable questionnaires (response rate 93%). Forty-nine percent (95% CI:
      44-54) had used some type of CAM within the past 12 months. CAM services were
      utilized by 27% (95% CI: 23-31) of the patients, 21% (95% CI: 16-23) reported use
      of CAM products, and 28% (95% CI: 23-31) used CAM self-help practices. The most
      common pattern of CAM use was to combine CAM services and CAM products.
      Significantly, more UC patients (56%) than CD patients (44%) reported CAM use, p 
      = 0.03. In UC, only the presence of at least one comorbid condition was directly 
      related to CAM use. In CD, being a woman, being aged 31-50 years, having a higher
      education level, and experiencing adverse drug reactions from IBD medication were
      factors independently associated with the use of CAM. CONCLUSION: Use of CAM was 
      common among IBD patients attending outpatient clinics. Both demographic and
      clinical factors were associated to CAM use, but the factors differed in their
      significance for UC and CD.

TI  - The etiology of small and fresh rectal bleeding in not-sick neonates: should we
      initially suspect food protein-induced proctocolitis?
PG  - 1845-9
LID - 10.1007/s00431-012-1825-2 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: This study was performed to identify the cause and frequency of food 
      protein-induced proctocolitis (FPIPC) in not-sick neonates with small and fresh
      rectal bleeding and to verify the effectiveness of oral food elimination and
      challenge test (ECT) as a diagnostic method of FPIPC. We prospectively analyzed
      neonates with small and fresh rectal bleeding who were clinically normal. We
      investigated age at symptom onset, feeding at onset of bleeding, the time of
      bleeding disappearance, stool smear and culture, endoscopic findings, and
      histopathologies in the biopsy specimens of 16 not-sick neonates. We performed
      food ECT in cases with over 4 days of persistent rectal bleeding in the absence
      of any other etiology. In 16 not-sick neonates with rectal bleeding, the median
      age at symptom onset was 8.5 (1-43) days. Endoscopic abnormalities were observed 
      in all 16 patients, and in 10 cases satisfying the pathological guidelines for
      FPIPC, two (12.5 %) were confirmed as FPIPC by food ECT. In the other 14 (87.5 %)
      cases, rectal bleeding spontaneously disappeared after on average at 4 (1-8) days
      and thus was diagnosed as idiopathic neonatal transient colitis (INTC).
      CONCLUSIONS: FPIPC is rare as a cause of small and fresh rectal bleeding in
      not-sick newborns and most of cases proved to be INTC. Although clinical findings
      are suspected as its symptoms and histological results satisfy its diagnostic
      criteria, FPIPC should be carefully confirmed through food ECT.

TI  - Gram-negative bacteria account for main differences between faecal microbiota
      from patients with ulcerative colitis and healthy controls.
PG  - 287-97
LID - 10.3920/BM2012.0018 [doi]
AB  - Detailed knowledge about the composition of the intestinal microbiota may be
      critical to unravel the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC), a human chronic 
      inflammatory bowel disease, since the intestinal microbes are expected to
      influence some of the key mechanisms involved in the inflammatory process of the 
      gut mucosa. The aim of this study was to investigate the faecal microbiota in
      patients either with UC in remission (n=6) or with active disease (n=6), and in
      healthy controls (n=6). The composition of Gram-negative bacteria and
      Gram-positive bacteria was examined. Antigenic structures of Gram-negative
      bacteria such as lipopolysaccharides have been related to the inflammatory
      responses and pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. Dice cluster analysis
      and principal component analysis of faecal microbiota profiles obtained by
      denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and quantitative PCR, respectively,
      revealed that the composition of faecal bacteria from UC patients with active
      disease differed from the healthy controls and that this difference should be
      ascribed to Gram-negative bacteria. The analysis did not show any clear grouping 
      of UC patients in remission. Even with the relatively low number of subjects in
      each group, we were able to detect a statistically significant
      underrepresentation of Lactobacillus spp. and Akkermansia muciniphila in UC
      patients with clinically active disease compared to the healthy controls. In line
      with previous communications, we have shown that the microbiota in UC patients
      with active disease differ from that in healthy controls. Our findings indicate
      that alterations in the composition of the Gram-negative bacterial population, as
      well as reduced numbers of lactobacilli and A. muciniphila may play a role in UC.

AB  - The essential micronutrient zinc has long been known to be a functional component
      of diverse structural proteins and enzymes. More recently, important roles for
      free or loosely bound intracellular zinc as a signaling factor have been
      reported. Insufficient zinc intake was shown to exacerbate symptoms in mouse
      models of inflammation such as experimental colitis, while zinc supplementation
      was found to improve intestinal barrier function. Herein, we provide evidence
      that intracellular zinc is essential for maintaining intestinal epithelial
      integrity when cells are exposed to the inflammatory cytokine Tumor Necrosis
      Factor (TNF)alpha. Using the human intestinal Caco-2/TC7 cell line as an in vitro
      model, we demonstrate that depletion of intracellular zinc affects
      TNFalpha-triggered signaling by shifting intestinal cell fate from survival to
      death. The mechanism underlying this effect was investigated. We show that
      TNFalpha promotes a zinc-dependent survival pathway that includes modulation of
      gene expression of transcription factors and signaling proteins. We have
      identified multiple regulatory steps regulated by zinc availability which include
      the induction of cellular Inhibitor of APoptosis (cIAP2) mRNA, possibly through
      activation of Nuclear Factor-Kappa B (NF-kappaB), as both nuclear translocation
      of the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB and up-regulation of cIAP2 mRNA were impaired
      following zinc depletion. Moreover, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein level
      was profoundly reduced by zinc depletion. Our results provide a possible
      molecular explanation for the clinical observation that zinc supplements
      ameliorate Crohn's disease symptoms and decrease intestinal permeability in
      experimental colitis.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome; update on pathophysiology and management.
PG  - 313-22
AB  - The description of the de novo development of irritable bowel syndrome following 
      an episode of bacterial gastroenteritis (pos-infectious irritable bowel syndrome)
      illustrated the potential for a luminal factor (a bacterial pathogen) to cause
      this common gastrointestinal ailment. As a consequence of these and other
      observations, as well as results of experiments involving animal models, the
      enteric flora and the immune response that it generates in the host have,
      somewhat surprisingly, come centre-stage in irritable bowel syndrome research,
      given their potential to induce the pathophysiological changes that are
      associated with irritable bowel syndrome. While evidence for immune dysfunction
      both in the mucosa and systemically continues to accumulate, methodological
      limitations have hampered a full delineation of the nature of the microbiota in
      irritable bowel syndrome. The latter is eagerly awaited and may yet provide a
      firm rationale for the use of certain probiotics and antibiotics in irritable
      bowel syndrome, whose benefits have now been described with some consistency.
      Despite its prevalence, there is a striking lack of effective therapeutic options
      for irritable bowel syndrome. While there is reason for optimism in the
      management of irritable bowel syndrome with several promising new agents
      currently undergoing clinical trials, confirmation of the efficacy and safety of 
      these agents in wider patient populations is awaited. A clearer understanding of 
      the physiopathologic mechanisms underlying irritable bowel syndrome, as well as
      of interrelationships between irritable bowel syndrome and other gastrointestinal
      and non-gastrointestinal disorders, will likely be required before effective drug
      therapies can be found.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
      disease are chronically relapsing, immune-mediated disorders of the
      gastrointestinal tract. A major challenge in the treatment of IBD is the
      heterogenous nature of these pathologies. Both, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
      disease are of multifactorial etiology and feature a complex interaction of host 
      genetic susceptibility and environmental factors such as diet and gut microbiota.
      Genome-wide association studies identified disease-relevant single-nucleotide
      polymorphisms in approximately 100 genes, but at the same time twin studies also 
      clearly indicated a strong environmental impact in disease development. However, 
      attempts to link dietary factors to the risk of developing IBD, based on
      epidemiological observations showed controversial outcomes. Yet, emerging
      high-throughput technologies implying complete biological systems might allow
      taking nutrient-gene interactions into account for a better classification of
      patient subsets in the future. In this context, 2 new scientific fields,
      "nutrigenetics" and "nutrigenomics" have been established. "Nutrigenetics,"
      studying the effect of genetic variations on nutrient-gene interactions and
      "Nutrigenomics," describing the impact of nutrition on physiology and health
      status on the level of gene transcription, protein expression, and metabolism. It
      is hoped that the integration of both research areas will promote the
      understanding of the complex gene-environment interaction in IBD etiology and in 
      the long-term will lead to personalized nutrition for disease prevention and
      treatment. This review briefly summarizes data on the impact of nutrients on
      intestinal inflammation, highlights nutrient-gene interactions, and addresses the
      potential of applying "omic" technologies in the context of IBD.

PG  - 94-101
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic disease that
      characteristically has a relapsing and remitting course. Probiotics might
      possibly induce remission in the treatment of active UC. Aims of our study were
      to assess the efficacy of VSL#3 on clinical response and colonic tissue cytokine 
      concentration changes in patients with active UC. METHODS: Twenty-four eligible
      patients with mild to moderate UC received open-label VSL#3 4 sachets daily in 2 
      divided doses for 8 weeks. The disease activity pre- and post-VSL#3 therapy was
      assessed by ulcerative colitis disease activity score and colonic tissue cytokine
      profiling done at baseline and at week 8. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (mean
      age, 43.7 years; range, 20-70 years; male/female, 15/9) were enrolled and 2
      patients did not have the final endoscopic assessment. A total of 22 patients
      were analyzed. Intent to treat analysis demonstrated remission in 45.8% of
      subjects (n=11); partial response in 20.8% (n=5); no change or worse in 25.0%
      (n=6) of subjects. The mean ulcerative colitis disease activity index (UCDAI)
      scores decreased from 7.09+/-1.81 to 1.45+/-1.29 in patients with a remission
      (p<0.001). The mean endoscopic scores had also significantly decreased from
      1.91+/-0.54 to 0.63+/-0.50 in patients with a remission (p<0.001). The
      concentrations of colonic cytokines did not change significantly during treatment
      in patients with a remission. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that VSL#3 is
      effective in achieving clinical responses and remissions in patients with mild-to
      moderately active UC, further supporting the potential role in UC therapy.

AB  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), a subset of Shiga toxin producing E.
      coli (STEC) is associated with a spectrum of diseases that includes diarrhea,
      hemorrhagic colitis and a life-threatening hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS).
      Regardless of serotype, Shiga toxins (Stx1 and/or Stx2) are uniformly expressed
      by all EHEC, and so exploitable targets for laboratory diagnosis of these
      pathogens. In this study, a sandwich ELISA for determination of Shiga toxin (Stx)
      was developed using anti-Stx2B subunit antibodies and its performance was
      compared with that of the Vero cell assay and a commercial immunoassay kit.
      Chicken IgY was used as capture antibody and a HRP-conjugated rabbit IgG as the
      detection antibody. The anti-Stx2B IgY was harvested from eggs laid by hens
      immunized with a recombinant protein fragment. Several parameters were tested in 
      order to optimize the sandwich ELISA assay, including concentration of
      antibodies, type and concentration of blocking agent, and incubation
      temperatures. Supernatants from 42 STEC strains of different serotypes and stx
      variants, including stx(2EDL933), stx(2vha), stx(2vhb), stx(2g), stx(1EDL933),
      and stx(1d) were tested. All Stx variants were detected by the sandwich ELISA,
      with a detection limit of 115 ng/ml Stx2. Twenty three strains negative for stx
      genes, including different bacteria species, showed no activity in Vero cell
      assay and produced negative results in ELISA, except for two strains. Our results
      show that anti-Stx2B IgY sandwich ELISA could be used in routine diagnosis as a
      rapid, specific and economic method for detection of Shiga toxin-producing E.

TI  - Fatal foodborne Clostridium perfringens illness at a state psychiatric
      hospital--Louisiana, 2010.
PG  - 605-8
AB  - Clostridium perfringens, the third most common cause of foodborne illness in the 
      United States (1), most often causes a self-limited, diarrheal disease lasting
      12-24 hours. Fatalities are very rare, occurring in <0.03% of cases (1). Death
      usually is caused by dehydration and occurs among the very young, the very old,
      and persons debilitated by illness (2). On May 7, 2010, 42 residents and 12 staff
      members at a Louisiana state psychiatric hospital experienced vomiting, abdominal
      cramps, and diarrhea. Within 24 hours, three patients had died. The three
      fatalities occurred among patients aged 41-61 years who were receiving
      medications that had anti-intestinal motility side effects. For two of three
      decedents, the cause of death found on postmortem examination was necrotizing
      colitis. Investigation by the Louisiana Office of Public Health (OPH) and CDC
      found that eating chicken served at dinner on May 6 was associated with illness. 
      The chicken was cooked approximately 24 hours before serving and not cooled in
      accordance with hospital guidelines. C. perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) was
      detected in 20 of 23 stool specimens from ill residents and staff members.
      Genetic testing of C. perfringens toxins isolated from chicken and stool
      specimens was carried out to determine which of the two strains responsible for
      C. perfringens foodborne illness was present. The specimens tested negative for
      the beta-toxin gene, excluding C. perfringens type C as the etiologic agent and
      implicating C. perfringens type A. This outbreak underscores the need for strict 
      food preparation guidelines at psychiatric inpatient facilities and the potential
      risk for adverse outcomes among any patients with impaired intestinal motility
      caused by medications, disease, and extremes of age when exposed to C.
      perfringens enterotoxin.

TI  - [Staphylococcal food poisoning and MRSA enterocolitis].
PG  - 1362-5
AB  - Staphylococcal food poisoning is a gastrointestinal illness. It is caused by
      eating foods contaminated with enterotoxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus.
      The enterotoxins are fast acting, sometimes causing illness within one to six
      hours. Patients typically experience nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, and
      diarrhea. Diagnosis of staphylococcal food poisoning is generally based only on
      the symptoms of patients. The treatments for these patients are rest and plenty
      of fluids. Antibiotics are not useful in treating this illness. On the other
      hand, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) enteritis and colitis
      caused by microbial substitution with administration of antibiotics is aggressive
      and sick with severe diarrhea. The treatment of those patients are as follows;
      antibiotics now in use are stopped and oral administration of vancomycin is
      started as soon as possible.

TI  - Chios mastic fractions in experimental colitis: implication of the nuclear factor
      kappaB pathway in cultured HT29 cells.
PG  - 974-83
LID - 10.1089/jmf.2012.0018 [doi]
AB  - The Pistacia lentiscus tree gives a resinous exudate called Chios mastic (CM)
      rich in triterpenoids. CM can be fractionated into acidic and neutral fractions
      (AF and NF, respectively). Oleanolic acid (OA) is a major triterpenic acid in CM 
      with several antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. We have recently shown
      that CM is beneficial in experimental colitis in the form of powder mixture with 
      inulin, as supplied commercially. However, the bioactive fraction or compound of 
      CM is unidentified. Thus, based on the hypothesis that terpenoids exhibit
      functional activities via distinguishable pathways, we fractionated CM and
      applied different fractions or individual OA in experimental colitis.
      Furthermore, we investigated the mechanism underlying this effect in human colon 
      epithelial cells. CM powder mixture (100 mg/kg of body weight) or the respective 
      CM powder mixture components (i.e., inulin, AF, NF, or OA) were individually
      administered in trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-treated rats. Colonic damage was
      assessed microscopically, and levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), 
      interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1were measured. A
      model of inflammation in co-cultured human colon epithelial HT29 cells and
      monocytes/macrophages was established. Lactate dehydrogenase release and levels
      of TNF-alpha, IL-8, and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65 were measured. In
      vivo, histological amelioration of colitis and significant regulation in
      inflammation occurred with CM powder mixture, even at the mRNA level. Although no
      histological improvement was observed, AF and NF reduced levels of inflammatory
      markers. Inulin was ineffective. In vitro, CM treatment down-regulated IL-8 and
      NF-kappaB p65. Neither fractions nor OA was the bioactive component solely. Most 
      probably, the entire CM rather than its individual fractions reduces inflammation
      via NF-kappaB regulation.

      colitis - an open pilot study.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A significant fraction of patients with ulcerative colitis
      (UC) is not sufficiently controlled with conventional therapy or suffers from
      therapy related side effects. Anthocyanins, highly abundant in bilberries
      (Vaccinium myrtillus), were shown to have antioxidative and anti-inflammatory
      effects. We aimed to explore the therapeutic potential of bilberries in active
      UC. METHODS: In an open pilot trial with a total follow-up of 9 weeks the effect 
      of a daily standardized anthocyanin-rich bilberry preparation was tested in 13
      patients with mild to moderate UC. Clinical, biochemical, endoscopic and
      histologic parameters were assessed. RESULTS: At the end of the 6 week treatment 
      interval 63.4% of patients achieved remission, the primary endpoint, while 90.9% 
      of patients showed a response. In all patients a decrease in total Mayo score was
      detected (mean: 6.5 and 3.6 at screening and week 7, respectively; p<0.001).
      Fecal calprotectin levels significantly decreased during the treatment phase
      (baseline: mean 778 mug/g, range 192-1790 mug/g; end of treatment: mean 305
      mug/g, range <30-1586 mug/g; p=0.049), including 4 patients achieving
      undetectable levels at end of treatment. A decrease in endoscopic Mayo score and 
      histologic Riley index confirmed the beneficial effect. However, an increase of
      calprotectin levels and disease activity was observed after cessation of bilberry
      intake. No serious adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first
      report on the promising therapeutic potential of a standardized anthocyanin-rich 
      bilberry preparation in UC in humans. These results clearly indicate a
      therapeutic potential of bilberries in UC. Further studies on mechanisms and
      randomized clinical trials are warranted.

TI  - Impact of environmental and dietary factors on the course of inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 3814-22
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v18.i29.3814 [doi]
AB  - Besides their possible effects on the development of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD), some environmental factors can modulate the clinical course of both
      ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). This review is mainly devoted
      to describing the current knowledge of the impact of some of these factors on the
      outcome of IBD, with special emphasis on smoking and diet. Although the impact of
      smoking on the susceptibility to develop CD and UC is firmly established, its
      influence on the clinical course of both diseases is still debatable. In CD,
      active smoking is a risk factor for postoperative recurrence. Beyond this
      clinical setting, smoking cessation seems to be advantageous in those CD patients
      who were smokers at disease diagnosis, while smoking resumption may be of benefit
      in ex-smokers with resistant UC. The role of dietary habits on the development of
      IBD is far from being well established. Also, food intolerances are very
      frequent, but usually inconsistent among IBD patients, and therefore no general
      dietary recommendations can be made in these patients. In general, IBD patients
      should eat a diet as varied as possible. Regarding the possible therapeutic role 
      of some dietary components in IBD, lessons should be drawn from the investigation
      of the primary therapeutic effect of enteral nutrition in CD. Low-fat diets seem 
      to be particularly useful. Also, some lipid sources, such as olive oil,
      medium-chain triglycerides, and perhaps omega-3 fatty acids, might have a
      therapeutic effect. Fermentable fiber may have a role in preventing relapses in
      inactive UC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment resistant chronic pouchitis causes significant morbidity.
      Elemental diet is effective treatment for Crohn's disease. Since pouchitis shares
      some similarities to Crohn's disease we hypothesised that elemental diet may be
      an effective treatment. METHOD: Seven pouchitis patients (with ulcerative
      colitis) were studied. All had active pouchitis with a pouch disease activity
      index (PDAI) >/=7. Exclusion criteria were recent NSAIDs, antibiotics or
      probiotics. Sufficient elemental diet to achieve energy requirements was
      provided. Flexible-pouchoscopy was performed, and the Cleveland Global Quality of
      Life score (CGQoL), Pouch Disease Activity Index (PDAI) and BMI were recorded at 
      baseline and following 28 days of elemental diet. Faecal samples were also
      collected at these time points and analysed for major bacterial groups using
      culture independent fluorescence in situ hybridisation. Data were analysed using 
      Wilcoxon's signed-rank test. RESULTS: Following 28 days of exclusive elemental
      diet, median stool frequency decreased from 12 to 6 per day (p=0.028), median
      clinical PDAI decreased from 4 to 1 (p=0.039). There was no significant
      difference in quality of life scores or PDAI before and following treatment.
      There was a trend towards an increase in the concentration of Clostridium
      coccoides-Eubacterium rectale (median 7.9 to 8.5 log(1)(0)/g, p=0.08) following
      exclusive elemental diet. CONCLUSION: Treatment with four weeks elemental diet
      appeared to improve the symptoms of chronic pouchitis in some patients but is not
      an effective strategy for inducing remission. Although a potential symptom
      modifier, elemental diet cannot be recommended for the routine treatment of
      active pouchitis.

TI  - The PepT1-transportable soy tripeptide VPY reduces intestinal inflammation.
PG  - 1753-63
LID - 10.1016/j.bbagen.2012.07.007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammation of the
      gastrointestinal tract. The peptide transporter PepT1 is responsible for the
      intestinal uptake of dietary peptides, and its expression in the gastrointestinal
      tract is up-regulated during intestinal inflammation, indicating that PepT1 may
      be a promising target for IBD therapeutics. METHODS: The transport of soy-derived
      di- and tripeptides across Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells was examined, and
      the anti-inflammatory effects of the transported peptide VPY were evaluated in
      vitro in Caco-2 and THP-1 macrophages, and in vivo in a mouse model of
      DSS-induced colitis. RESULTS: VPY inhibited the secretion of IL-8 and TNF-alpha, 
      respectively, from Caco-2 and THP-1 cells. VPY transport and anti-inflammatory
      activity in Caco-2 cells was reduced in the presence of Gly-Sar, indicating this 
      activity was mediated by PepT1. In mice, VPY treatment reduced DSS-induced
      colitis symptoms and weight loss, improved colon histology, reduced MPO activity,
      and decreased gene expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-6, 
      IL-1beta, IFN-gamma and IL-17 in the colon. CONCLUSIONS AND GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE:
      VPY is a novel PepT1 substrate that can inhibit the production of
      pro-inflammatory mediators in vitro in intestinal epithelial and immune cells,
      and reduce the severity of colitis in mice by down-regulating the expression of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines in the colon, suggesting that VPY may be promising for
      the treatment of IBD.

TI  - Curcumin, an active component of turmeric in the prevention and treatment of
      ulcerative colitis: preclinical and clinical observations.
PG  - 1109-17
LID - 10.1039/c2fo30097d [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) comprising of ulcerative colitis (UC) and
      Crohn's disease (CD) is a major ailment affecting the small and large bowel. In
      clinics, IBD is treated using 5-amninosalicylates, antibiotics, the steroids and 
      immunomodulators. Unfortunately, the long term usages of these agents are
      associated with undue side effects and compromise the therapeutic advantage.
      Accordingly, there is a need for novel agents that are effective, acceptable and 
      non toxic to humans. Preclinical studies in experimental animals have shown that 
      curcumin, an active principle of the Indian spice turmeric (Curcuma longa Linn)
      is effective in preventing or ameliorating UC and inflammation. Over the last few
      decades there has been increasing interest in the possible role of curcumin in
      IBD and several studies with various experimental models of IBD have shown it to 
      be effective in mediating the inhibitory effects by scavenging free radicals,
      increasing antioxidants, influencing multiple signaling pathways, especially the 
      kinases (MAPK, ERK), inhibiting myeloperoxidase, COX-1, COX-2, LOX, TNF-alpha,
      IFN-gamma, iNOS; inhibiting the transcription factor NF-kappaB. Clinical studies 
      have also shown that co-administration of curcumin with conventional drugs was
      effective, to be well-tolerated and treated as a safe medication for maintaining 
      remission, to prevent relapse and improve clinical activity index. Large
      randomized controlled clinical investigations are required to fully understand
      the potential of oral curcumin for treating IBD.

TI  - Use of exclusive enteral nutrition in paediatric Crohn's disease in The
      Netherlands.
PG  - 263-70
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2012.07.001 [doi]
LID - S1873-9946(12)00312-1 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A six-week course of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is
      recommended as first treatment in active paediatric Crohn's disease (CD). We
      aimed to assess short-term and long-term outcome of EEN, and to identify
      predictive factors of treatment success. METHODS: The medical records of newly
      diagnosed paediatric CD patients initiating EEN as remission induction therapy
      between January 2008 and October 2011 were retrospectively studied. Treatment
      outcome was assessed using a previously described pattern recognition model.
      RESULTS: 77 CD patients (median age 13.9 years, 57% male) initiated a six-week
      course of EEN, combined with azathioprine maintenance treatment in 92%. Patients 
      received EEN as either hyperosmolar sip feeds or polymeric formula by nasogastric
      tube. In patients completing a six-week course of EEN (n=58), complete remission 
      was achieved in 71%, partial remission in 26%, and no response in 3%. Complete
      remission rates were higher in children presenting with isolated ileal/ileocaecal
      disease and malnutrition. Nineteen patients discontinued EEN before the intended 
      treatment period due to worsening of symptoms (n=9) or adherence issues (n=10).
      Non-adherence occurred more often in older children, females, children from
      non-Dutch parents, and patients taking hyperosmolar sip feeds compared with
      polymeric formula by nasogastric tube. The likelihood of relapsing disease within
      the first year after EEN treatment was 59%. CONCLUSION: A six-week course of EEN 
      is effective in newly diagnosed paediatric CD, with response rates that seem to
      be influenced by disease location and nutritional status, but not by type of
      formula. Non-adherence occurs frequently and limits the success of this treatment
      in everyday clinical practice.

TI  - Arvelexin inhibits colonic inflammation by suppression of NF-kappaB activation in
      dextran sulfate sodium-induced mice and TNF-alpha-induced colonic epithelial
      cells.
PG  - 7398-407
LID - 10.1021/jf3009553 [doi]
AB  - Recently, we reported the anti-inflammatory effects of arvelexin isolated from
      Brassica rapa in macrophages. In the present study, the effects of arvelexin were
      investigated in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model and in
      a cellular model. In the DSS-induced colitis model, arvelexin significantly
      reduced the severity of colitis, as assessed by disease activity, colonic damage,
      neutrophil infiltration, and levels of colonic iNOS. Moreover, arvelexin
      inhibited the expressions of IL-8, IP-10, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 in HT-29 colonic
      epithelial cells. Arvelexin also inhibited the TNF-alpha-induced adhesion of U937
      monocytic cells to HT-29 cells. Furthermore, arvelexin reduced p65 NF-kappaB
      subunit translocation to the nucleus and IkappaBalpha degradation in the colonic 
      tissues and in TNF-alpha-induced HT-29 cells. These results demonstrate that the 
      ameliorative effects of arvelexin on colonic injury are mainly related to its
      ability to inhibit the inflammatory responses via NF-kappaB inactivation, and
      support its possible therapeutic role in colitis.

AB  - IBD is a chronic and relapsing inflammatory disorder of the gut that demands
      long-lasting treatment targeting both flare-up periods and maintenance of
      remission. Oral systemic steroids have been used to induce remission in patients 
      with active IBD for over 50 years due to their potent anti-inflammatory effects. 
      The efficacy of systemic steroids in this setting has been largely demonstrated. 
      However, the wide range of adverse events associated with these drugs has
      prompted the development of equally effective but less toxic steroid compounds.
      Currently, topically acting oral steroids are an important therapeutic option for
      Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and microscopic colitis, being oral
      budesonide and oral beclomethasone established elements of the IBD armamentarium.
      At present, oral budesonide is the first-line therapy to induce remission in
      microscopic colitis and mild to moderate ileocaecal CD patients and oral
      beclomethasone is effective treating mild to moderate UC patients with left-sided
      or extensive disease. This review aims at evaluating the current role of these
      compounds in IBD clinical practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Reducing symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) by
      dietary supplements represents more than ever an attractive clinical approach.
      Since the use of spore forming bacteria may offer interesting advantages, the aim
      of the study was to address the anti-inflammatory potential of Bacillus >subtilis
      strain PB6 (ATCC - PTA 6737) spores, provided as a powder preparation. METHODS:
      The immunomodulatory potential of strain PB6 was first characterized in vitro on 
      human immunocompetent cells for both the commercial spore powder (Anaban) and two
      phenotypic variants of the vegetative form. Assessment of the in vivo
      anti-inflammatory capacity of the standard spore powder and a variant spore
      powder preparation was performed using a mouse model of acute, TNBS-induced
      colitis. Performance was compared with the drug prednisolone, and was based on
      blinded macroscopic and histological scores, blood inflammatory markers and
      measurements of infiltration of mucosal neutrophils. RESULTS: Strain PB6 induced 
      substantial levels of IL-10 but very low levels of IL-12, TNFalpha and IFNgamma
      on human PBMC. Both spore powders prevented colitis as shown by significant
      reductions of near all inflammatory read-outs. CONCLUSION: B. subtilis strain
      PB6, provided as a preparation of spores, shows pre-clinical anti-inflammatory
      effects, suggesting further evaluation in a clinical intervention trial, e.g.
      with IBD type patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Decreased bone mineral density (BMD) is common in Crohn's
      disease (CD) patients. This paper reports on the prevalence of decreased BMD in a
      referral cohort study of CD-patients next to the change of BMD over time in
      relation with CD-associated clinical characteristics. METHODS: 205 CD patients of
      a referral hospital were enrolled between January1998-January 2010 when
      measurement of BMD by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was available. Follow-up
      DXA scan was performed in subjects with known risk factors besides Crohn
      indicative for low BMD. Treatment of CD patients was according to a protocol
      which is comparable to the current (inter)national guidelines. In osteopenic
      patients, supplemental vitamin D (800 IU) and Calcium (500-1000 mg) were
      prescribed. RESULTS: Mean BMD at baseline was 0.97 +/- 0.16 gram/cm(2) in lumbar 
      spine and 0.87 +/- 0.12 gram/cm(2) in the total hip. At baseline, higher age and 
      low Body Mass Index (BMI), were negatively correlated with BMD. Eighty-four
      patients underwent a second BMD assessment with a median interval period of 4
      years (IQR 3-6). A mean annual increase of +0.76% (95%CI: -2.63%; +3.87%) in
      lumbar spine and +0.43% (95%CI: -2.65% ; +1.11%) in total hip was observed.
      CONCLUSIONS: Higher age, male sex, low BMI, and a higher age at diagnosis of CD
      were associated with low BMD. Follow-up of BMD in CD patients showed a
      contraintuitive small increase of BMD at lumbar spine and total hip in CD
      patients only using supplemental vitamin D and calcium next to strict treatment
      of CD.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To identify environmental risk factors for developing
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children <15 years of age. METHODS: IBD
      patients and randomly selected healthy controls from a well defined geographical 
      area in Denmark were prospectively recruited in the period 1.1.2007-31.12.2009.
      Data regarding socioeconomic status, area of residence, living conditions,
      infections and diet were obtained by a questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 118 IBD
      patients (59 Crohn's disease (CD), 56 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 3 IBD
      unclassified (IBDU)) and 477 healthy controls filled out the questionnaire. The
      response rates were 91% in patients and 45% in controls, respectively. Several
      risk factors for IBD were identified: IBD in first degree relatives (IBD: OR
      (odds ratio): 6.1 (95%CI: 2.5-15.0), CD (OR: 6.8 (2.3-20.2)) and UC (OR: 6.1
      (2.3-16.0))); bedroom sharing (IBD: OR: 2.1 (1.0-4.3), CD (OR: 3.6 (1.3-9.4)));
      high sugar intake (IBD: OR: 2.5 (1.0-6.2), CD (OR: 2.9 (1.0-8.5))); prior
      admission to a hospital for gastrointestinal infections (IBD: 7.7 (3.1-19.1), CD 
      (7.9 (2.5-24.9)) and UC (7.4 (2.5-21.6))); stressful events (IBD: 1.7 (1.0-2.9)).
      Protective factors were daily vs. less than daily vegetable consumption (CD: 0.3 
      (0.1-1.0), UC (0.3 (0.1-0.8))) and whole meal bread consumption (IBD: OR: 0.5
      (0.3-0.9), CD (0.4 (0.2-0.9))). An increased risk of diagnosis of CD compared to 
      UC was shown for patients living in more urban areas (OR: 1.3 (1.1-1.6)).
      CONCLUSION: We identified several risk and protective factors for developing IBD.
      Studies on the influence of environmental factors are important in our
      understanding of aetiology and phenotypes of paediatric IBD.

AB  - The probiotic Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 (EcN) is one of the few
      probiotics licensed as a medication in several countries. Best documented is its 
      effectiveness in keeping patients suffering from ulcerative colitis (UC) in
      remission. This might be due to its ability to induce the production of human
      beta-defensin 2 (HBD2) in a flagellin-dependent way in intestinal epithelial
      cells. In contrast to ulcerative colitis, for Crohn's disease (CD) convincing
      evidence is lacking that EcN might be clinically effective, most likely due to
      the genetically based inability of sufficient defensin production in CD patients.
      As a first step in the development of an alternative approach for the treatment
      of CD patients, EcN strains were constructed which were able to produce human
      alpha-defensin 5 (HD5) or beta-defensin 2 (HBD2). For that purpose,
      codon-optimized defensin genes encoding either the proform with the signal
      sequence of human alpha-defensin 5 (HD5) or the gene encoding HBD2 with or
      without the signal sequence were cloned in an expression vector plasmid under the
      control of the T7 promoter. Synthesis of the encoded defensins was shown by
      Western blots after induction of expression and lysis of the recombinant EcN
      strains. Recombinant mature HBD2 with an N-terminal His-tag could be purified by 
      Ni-column chromatography and showed antimicrobial activity against E. coli,
      Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes. In a second
      approach, that part of the HBD2 gene which encodes mature HBD2 was fused with the
      yebF gene. The resulting fusion protein YebFMHBD2 was secreted from the encoding 
      EcN mutant strain after induction of expression. Presence of YebFMHBD2 in the
      medium was not the result of leakage from the bacterial cells, as demonstrated in
      the spent culture supernatant by Western blots specific for beta-galactosidase
      and maltose-binding protein. The dialyzed and concentrated culture supernatant
      inhibited the growth of E. coli, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium and L.
      monocytogenes in radial diffusion assays as well as in liquid culture. This
      demonstrates EcN to be a suitable probiotic E. coli strain for the production of 
      certain defensins.

AB  - In vitro and animals models have long been used to study human diseases and
      identify novel therapeutic approaches that can be applied to combat these
      conditions. Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are the two main entities of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). There is an intricate relationship between IBD 
      features in human patients, in vitro and animal colitis models, mechanisms and
      possible therapeutic approaches in these models, and strategies that can be
      extrapolated and applied in humans. Malnutrition, particularly protein-energy
      malnutrition and vitamin and micronutrient deficiencies, as well as dysregulation
      of the intestinal microbiota, are common features of IBD. Based on these
      observations, dietary supplementation with essential nutrients known to be in
      short supply in the diet in IBD patients and with other molecules believed to
      provide beneficial anti-inflammatory effects, as well as with probiotic organisms
      that stimulate immune functions and resistance to infection has been tested in
      colitis models. Here we review current knowledge on nutritional and probiotic
      supplementation in in vitro and animal colitis models. While some of these
      strategies require further fine-tuning before they can be applied in human IBD
      patients, their intended purpose is to prevent, delay or treat disease symptoms
      in a non-pharmaceutical manner.

      proteomic inflammation profile in patients with ulcerative colitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate diagnostic and monitoring tools for ulcerative colitis (UC) 
      are missing. Our aim was to describe the proteomic profile of UC and search for
      markers associated with disease exacerbation. Therefore, we aimed to characterize
      specific proteins associated with inflamed colon mucosa from patients with acute 
      UC using mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. METHODS: Biopsies were
      sampled from rectum, sigmoid colon and left colonic flexure from twenty patients 
      with active proctosigmoiditis and from four healthy controls for proteomics and
      histology. Proteomic profiles of whole colonic biopsies were characterized using 
      2D-gel electrophoresis, and peptide mass fingerprinting using matrix-assisted
      laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was
      applied for identification of differently expressed protein spots. RESULTS: A
      total of 597 spots were annotated by image analysis and 222 of these had a
      statistically different protein level between inflamed and non-inflamed tissue in
      the patient group. Principal component analysis clearly grouped non-inflamed
      samples separately from the inflamed samples indicating that the proteomic
      signature of colon mucosa with acute UC is strong. Totally, 43 individual protein
      spots were identified, including proteins involved in energy metabolism
      (triosephosphate isomerase, glycerol-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase, alpha enolase and
      L-lactate dehydrogenase B-chain) and in oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase,
      thioredoxins and selenium binding protein). CONCLUSIONS: A distinct proteomic
      profile of inflamed tissue in UC patients was found. Specific proteins involved
      in energy metabolism and oxidative stress were identified as potential candidate 
      markers for UC.

TI  - Intestinal microbiota and secretory immunoglobulin A in feces of exclusively
      breast-fed infants with blood-streaked stools.
PG  - 657-63

AB  - Episodes of blood-streaked stools are not uncommon in exclusively breast-fed
      infants under 6 months of age. Such bleeding is thought to be associated with
      food protein-induced proctocolitis, however the pathomechanism remains unclear.
      The aim of this study was to investigate intestinal microbiota and secretory
      immunoglobulin A in the feces of exclusively breast-fed infants with
      blood-streaked stools. Fecal specimens from 15 full-term infants with
      blood-streaked stools and 15 breast-fed healthy infants were studied and the
      results compared. All infants had been delivered vaginally and exclusively
      breast-fed. The fecal microbiota were investigated by phylogenetic analysis
      combined with culture methods for some bacterial species, and feces were assessed
      for the presence of fecal secretory immunoglobulin A by enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay. Phylogenetic cluster analysis revealed four major clusters
      of fecal bacteria, cluster A being found only in healthy infants. The Bacteroides
      fragilis group was observed more frequently in controls than in patients (P <
      0.05). In the controls, the predominant species belonging to the
      Enterobacteriaceae group was Escherichia coli, whereas in the patients it was
      Klebsiella (P < 0.05). Concentrations of secretory immunoglobulin A were high in 
      one third of the healthy controls. In conclusion, the pathomechanism of rectal
      bleeding in exclusively breast-fed infants may be related to differences in the
      composition of their intestinal flora.

TI  - Molecular characterization reveals three distinct clonal groups among clinical
      shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli strains of serogroup O103.
PG  - 2894-900
AB  - Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is one of the most important groups
      of food-borne pathogens, and STEC strains belonging to the serotype O103:H2 can
      cause diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, and hemolytic-uremic syndrome in humans.
      STEC O103:non-H2 strains are also sometimes isolated from human patients, but
      their genetic characteristics and role in significant human enteric disease are
      not yet understood. Here, we investigated 17 STEC O103:non-H2 strains, including 
      O103:H11, O103:H25, O103:HUT (UT [untypeable]), and O103:H- (nonmotile) isolated 
      in Japan, and their characteristics were compared to those of STEC O103:H2 and
      other serotype STEC strains. Sequence analyses of fliC and eae genes revealed
      that strains possessed any of the following combinations: fliC-H2/eae-epsilon,
      fliC-H11/eae-beta1, and fliC-H25/eae-theta, where fliC-H2, -H11, and -H25
      indicate fliC genes encoding H2, H11, and H25 flagella antigens, respectively,
      and eae-epsilon, -beta1, and -theta indicate eae genes encoding epsilon, beta1,
      and theta subclass intimins, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on the
      sequences of seven housekeeping genes demonstrated that the O103:H11/[fliC-H11]
      and O103:H25/[fliC-H25] strains formed two distinct groups, different from that
      of the O103:H2/[fliC-H2] strains. Interestingly, a group consisting of O103:H11
      strains was closely related to STEC O26:H11, which is recognized as a most
      important non-O157 serotype, suggesting that the STEC O103:H11 and STEC O26:H11
      clones evolved from a common ancestor. The multiplex PCR system for the rapid
      typing of STEC O103 strains described in the present study may aid clinical and
      epidemiological studies of the STEC O103:H2, O103:H11, and O103:H25 groups. In
      addition, our data provide further insights into the high variability of STEC
      stains with emerging new serotypes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In normal mucosa, intestinal lamina propria macrophages (IMACs)
      maintain tolerance against food antigens and the commensal bacterial flora.
      Several mechanisms have been identified that mediate tolerance. The
      ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is a large multiprotein complex that degrades
      cellular proteins. As the UPS may modulate immune functions of IMACs, we
      performed a detailed investigation of UPS expression and function under normal
      conditions and in cells derived from patients suffering from inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). METHODS: IMACs were isolated from intestinal mucosa. mRNA
      expression of macrophages differentiated in vitro (i.v. MACs) and IMACs was
      compared by Affymetrix(R) oligonucleotide arrays. Quantitative Taqman-PCR was
      performed on five exemplary proteasomal and five ubiquitinylation genes each.
      Proteins were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Proteasome
      function was assessed by a fluorimetric test. RESULTS: Affymetrix analysis showed
      downregulation of mRNA expression of almost all represented proteasomal and of 22
      ubiquitination-associated genes in IMACs as compared to i.v. MACs and monocytes. 
      By quantitative PCR, up to tenfold higher mRNA expression of 10 exemplary genes
      of the UPS (UBE2A, UBE2D2, UBE2L6, USP14, UBB and ATPase2, beta2, beta5,
      beta2i/MECL-1, beta5i/LMP7) was demonstrated in i.v. MACs as compared to IMACs.
      Immunohistochemistry and Western blots confirmed these findings in intestinal
      mucosa of controls and patients suffering from diverticulitis. In contrast, a
      significant increase in protein amounts was found in mucosa of patients with IBD.
      CONCLUSION: Reduced expression of subunits of the UPS in IMACs of normal mucosa
      supports the concept of the presence of a nonreactive, anergic macrophage
      phenotype in the gut under normal conditions. Reinduction in IMACs of IBD mucosa 
      reflects activated IMACs which can present antigenic peptides and thus support
      inflammation.

TI  - Microscopic colitis: Current status, present and future challenges: statements of
      the European Microscopic Colitis Group.
PG  - 932-45
AB  - Microscopic colitis (MC) is an inflammatory bowel disease presenting with
      chronic, non-bloody watery diarrhoea and few or no endoscopic abnormalities. The 
      histological examination reveals mainly two subtypes of MC, lymphocytic or
      collagenous colitis. Despite the fact that the incidence in MC has been rising
      over the last decades, research has been sparse and our knowledge about MC
      remains limited. Specialists in the field have initiated the European Microscopic
      Colitis Group (EMCG) with the primary goal to create awareness on MC. The EMCG is
      furthermore a forum with the intention to promote clinical and basic research. In
      this article statements and comments are given that all members of the EMCG have 
      considered being of importance for a better understanding of MC. The paper
      focuses on the newest updates in epidemiology, symptoms and diagnostic criteria, 
      pathophysiology and highlights some unsolved problems. Moreover, a new treatment 
      algorithm is proposed on the basis of new evidence from well-designed, randomized
      control trials.

TI  - Campylobacter jejuni-mediated induction of CC and CXC chemokines and chemokine
      receptors in human dendritic cells.
PG  - 2929-39
LID - 10.1128/IAI.00129-12 [doi]
AB  - Campylobacter jejuni is a leading worldwide bacterial cause of human diarrheal
      disease. Although the specific molecular mechanisms of C. jejuni pathogenesis
      have not been characterized in detail, host inflammatory responses are thought to
      be major contributing factors to the resulting typical acute colitis. The
      intestinal mucosal chemokine response is particularly important in the initial
      stages of bacterium-induced gut inflammation. Chemokines attract blood phagocytes
      and lymphocytes to the site of infection and regulate immune cell maturation and 
      the development of localized lymphoid tissues. The production of chemokines by
      dendritic cells (DCs) following Campylobacter infection has not yet been
      analyzed. In the current study, we infected human monocyte-derived DCs with C.
      jejuni to examine the production of key proinflammatory chemokines and chemokine 
      receptors. The chemokines, including CC families (macrophage inflammatory protein
      1alpha [MIP-1alpha], MIP-1beta, RANTES) and CXC families (growth-related oncogene
      alpha [GRO-alpha], IP-10, and monokine induced by gamma interferon [MIG]), were
      upregulated in Campylobacter-infected DCs. Chemokine receptors CCR6 and CCR7,
      with roles in DC trafficking, were also induced in Campylobacter-infected DCs.
      Further, Campylobacter infection stimulated the phosphorylation of P38, P44/42,
      and stress-activated protein kinase/Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK)
      mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in DCs. NF-kappaB activation was
      specifically involved in chemokine induction in DCs infected with C. jejuni.
      Additionally, STAT3 was significantly increased in Campylobacter-infected DCs
      compared to that in uninfected DCs. These results suggest that DCs play a
      significant role in the initiation and modulation of the inflammatory response by
      enlisting monocytes, neutrophils, and T lymphocytes during human intestinal
      infection with Campylobacter.

PG  - 75-8
LID - 10.1097/MAJ.0b013e31824c07e8 [doi]
AB  - Infliximab has well-established complications including injection site and
      allergic reactions, cytopenias, induction of autoimmune and demyelinating
      diseases and malignancy, especially lymphoma. Pulmonary complications are well
      documented and include serious respiratory infections from tuberculosis, fungal
      and opportunistic pathogens. This has prompted a Food and Drug Administration
      black-box warning recommending close surveillance for these diseases. Nonspecific
      interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP) secondary to tumor necrosis factor-alpha
      inhibitor (TNF-alpha) therapy is less well described. Rarely, TNF-alpha inhibitor
      therapy has been reported to cause NSIP when used in conjunction with other
      immunosuppressive agents. Literature search revealed 12 independent patients with
      presumed infliximab-induced NSIP in 8 separate publications; all patients were on
      concomitant steroid sparing immunosuppressive agents, complicating cause and
      effect. The authors report a case in which infliximab is surmised to cause NSIP
      in the absence of other steroid sparing immunosuppressants in a young female with
      ulcerative colitis. Of importance, the patient was taking no additional steroid
      sparing immunomodulating agents. The diagnosis was based on clinical presentation
      and radiologic and histopathological data. Cessation of infliximab and high-dose 
      steroid therapy resulted in complete resolution of the patient's presenting signs
      and symptoms.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) encompassed several chronic inflammatory
      disorders leading to damage of the gastrointestinal tract (GI). The 2 principal
      forms of these disorders are ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD).
      Bacteria are involved in the etiology of IBD, and the genetic susceptibility,
      environmental factors, and lifestyle factors can affect the individual's
      predisposition to IBD. The review discusses the potential role of environmental
      factors such as diet and microbiota as well as genetics in the etiology of IBD.
      It is suggested that microbial ecosystem in the human bowel colonizing the gut in
      many different microhabitats can be influence by diet, leading to formation of
      metabolic processes that are essential form the bowel metabolism.

AB  - On April 6, 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved vandetanib
      (Caprelsa tablets; AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP) for the treatment of
      symptomatic or progressive medullary thyroid cancer in patients with
      unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic disease. Vandetanib is the first
      drug approved for this indication, and this article focuses on the basis of
      approval. Approval was based on the results of a double-blind trial conducted in 
      patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma. Patients were randomized 2:1 to
      vandetanib, 300 mg/d orally (n = 231), or to placebo (n = 100). The primary
      objective was demonstration of improvement in progression-free survival (PFS)
      with vandetanib compared with placebo. Other endpoints included evaluation of
      overall survival and objective response rate. The PFS analysis showed a marked
      improvement for patients randomized to vandetanib (hazard ratio = 0.35; 95%
      confidence interval, 0.24-0.53; P < 0.0001). The objective response rate for the 
      vandetanib arm was 44% compared with 1% for the placebo arm. The most common
      grade 3 and 4 toxicities (>5%) were diarrhea and/or colitis, hypertension and
      hypertensive crisis, fatigue, hypocalcemia, rash, and corrected QT interval (QTc)
      prolongation. This approval was based on a statistically significant and
      clinically meaningful improvement in PFS. Given the toxicity profile, which
      includes prolongation of the QT interval and sudden death, only prescribers and
      pharmacies certified through the vandetanib Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategy
      Program are able to prescribe and dispense vandetanib. Treatment-related risks
      should be taken into account when considering the use of vandetanib in patients
      with indolent, asymptomatic, or slowly progressing disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel disease, a chronic inflammation of the
      intestinal tract, presents in two variations, Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn's
      disease (CD). Given that treatment of CD differs from UC, a single test that
      provided strong diagnostic ability would offer great clinical value. Two previous
      studies have indicated that CD can be distinguished from UC, and that both can be
      distinguished from non-IBD-type gastrointestinal disease, based on urinary and
      faecal metabolite profiling. METHODS: Analysis of healthy as well as CD and UC
      patients attending an IBD clinic was performed. IBD patients were classified into
      two groups (CD or UC) based on chart review of clinical, endoscopic, and
      histological assessment. Urine samples were obtained and analyzed using nuclear
      magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy combined with targeted profiling
      techniques, followed by univariate and multivariate statistical analysis.
      RESULTS: Based on urinary metabolomics, individuals with IBD could be
      differentiated from healthy. Major differences between IBD and healthy included
      TCA cycle intermediates, amino acids, and gut microflora metabolites. Comparison 
      of CD and UC patients revealed discrimination, but removal of patients with the
      surgical intervention confounder revealed that CD could not be discriminated from
      UC. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the potential for metabolomics to
      distinguish IBD from the healthy state but shows that careful consideration must 
      be given to establishing disease-representative cohorts that are free of
      confounding factors.

PG  - S240-52
LID - 10.1017/S0007114512001626 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIM: Despite their well known anti-inflammatory actions, the
      clinical usefulness of omega-3 PUFA in inflammatory bowel disease is
      controversial. We aimed to systematically review the available data on the
      performance of omega-3 PUFA as therapeutic agents in these patients. METHODS:
      Electronic databases were systematically searched for RCT of fish oil or omega-3 
      PUFA therapy in both active and inactive ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease,
      without limitation on either the length of therapy or the form it was given,
      including nutritional supplements and enteral formula diets. Eligible articles
      were assessed for methodological quality on the basis of the adequacy of the
      randomisation process, concealment of allocation, blinding of intervention and
      outcome, possible biases, and completeness of follow-up. The five-point Oxford
      quality score was calculated. RESULTS: A total of 19 RCT were finally selected
      for this review. Overall, available data do not allow to support the use of
      omega-3 PUFA supplementation for the treatment of both active and inactive
      inflammatory bowel disease. Negative results are quite consistent in trials
      assessing the use of omega-3 PUFA to maintain disease remission, particularly
      ulcerative colitis, and to a lesser extent Crohn's disease. Trials on their use
      in active disease do not allow to draw firm conclusions mainly because the
      heterogeneity of design (ulcerative colitis) or their short number (Crohn's
      disease). In most trials, the appropriateness of the selected placebo is
      questionable. CONCLUSION: The present systematic review does not allow to make
      firm recommendations about the usefulness of omega-3 PUFA in inflammatory bowel
      disease.

TI  - Management of immune-related adverse events and kinetics of response with
      ipilimumab.
PG  - 2691-7
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2012.41.6750 [doi]
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies directed against the immune checkpoint protein cytotoxic
      T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4; CD152)-ipilimumab and tremelimumab-have been
      investigated in metastatic melanoma and other cancers and have shown promising
      results. Recently, ipilimumab was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration
      for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. We review the literature on managing
      the adverse effects and kinetics of tumor regression with ipilimumab and provide 
      guidelines on their management. During treatment with these antibodies, a unique 
      set of adverse effects may occur, called immune-related adverse events (irAEs).
      These include rashes, which may rarely progress to life-threatening toxic
      epidermal necrolysis, and colitis, characterized by a mild to moderate, but
      occasionally also severe and persistent diarrhea. Hypophysitis, hepatitis,
      pancreatitis, iridocyclitis, lymphadenopathy, neuropathies, and nephritis have
      also been reported with ipilimumab. Early recognition of irAEs and initiation of 
      treatment are critical to reduce the risk of sequelae. Interestingly, irAEs
      correlated with treatment response in some studies. Unique kinetics of response
      have been observed with CTLA-4 blockade with at least four patterns: (1) response
      in baseline lesions by week 12, with no new lesions seen; (2) stable disease,
      followed by a slow, steady decline in total tumor burden; (3) regression of tumor
      after initial increase in total tumor burden; and (4) reduction in total tumor
      burden during or after the appearance of new lesion(s) after week 12. We provide 
      a detailed description of irAEs and recommendations for practicing oncologists
      who are managing them, along with the unusual kinetics of response associated
      with ipilimumab therapy.

AB  - Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157:H7
      and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are key elements in
      preventing resultant life-threatening illnesses, such as hemorrhagic colitis,
      hemolytic uremic syndrome, and septicemia. In this report, we describe the use of
      surface plasmon resonance (SPR) for the biodetection of pathogenic bacteria,
      using bacteriophages as the recognition elements. T4 bacteriophages were used to 
      detect E. coli, while a novel, highly specific phage was used to detect MRSA. We 
      found that the system permits label-free, real-time, specific, rapid and
      cost-effective detection of pathogens, for concentrations of 10(3) colony forming
      units/milliliter, in less than 20 min. This system promises to become a
      diagnostic tool for bacteria that cause major public concern for food safety,
      bioterrorism, and nosocomial infections.

TI  - Structure-function relationships of human milk oligosaccharides.
PG  - 383S-91S
LID - 10.3945/an.111.001404 [doi]
AB  - Human milk contains more than a hundred structurally distinct oligosaccharides.
      In this review, we provide examples of how the structural characteristics of
      these human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) determine functionality. Specific
      alpha1-2-fucosylated HMO have been shown to serve as antiadhesive antimicrobials 
      to protect the breast-fed infant against infections with Campylobacter jejuni,
      one of the most common causes of bacterial diarrhea. In contrast,
      alpha1-2-fucosylation may abolish the beneficial effects of HMO against Entamoeba
      histolytica, a protozoan parasite that causes colitis, acute dysentery, or
      chronic diarrhea. In a different context, HMO need to be both fucosylated and
      sialylated to reduce selectin-mediated leukocyte rolling, adhesion, and
      activation, which may protect breast-fed infants from excessive immune responses.
      In addition, our most recent data show that a single HMO that carries not 1 but 2
      sialic acids protects neonatal rats from necrotizing enterocolitis, one of the
      most common and often fatal intestinal disorders in preterm infants.
      Oligosaccharides currently added to infant formula are structurally different
      from the oligosaccharides naturally occurring in human milk. Thus, it appears
      unlikely that they can mimic some of the structure-specific effects of HMO.
      Recent advances in glycan synthesis and isolation have increased the availability
      of certain HMO tri- and tetrasaccharides for in vitro and in vivo preclinical
      studies. In the end, intervention studies are needed to confirm that the
      structure-specific effects observed at the laboratory bench translate into
      benefits for the human infant. Ultimately, breastfeeding remains the number one
      choice to nourish and nurture our infants.

AB  - Probiotics are organisms which provide a desired and beneficial effect on human
      health. With recent evidence implicating a disruption in the balance of the
      gastrointestinal microbiome and intestinal immunity as a potential trigger for
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), there has been growing interest in using
      probiotics as an adjunct to standard anti-inflammatory and immune suppressing
      therapy. Animal models describe potential and plausible mechanisms of action for 
      probiotics to counter inflammation of colonic mucosa. Although there are
      insufficient data to recommend probiotics in ulcerative colitis or Crohn's
      disease, good evidence supports the use of specific probiotics for maintenance of
      remission in pouchitis. Although there are limited regulatory standards for the
      agents, probiotics are relatively safe with minimal reported side effects or
      contraindications. More rigorous studies need to be published supporting efficacy
      and safety of these agents before they become a mainstay of IBD medical
      treatment.

TI  - Prolongation of carrageenan-induced inflammation in human colonic epithelial
      cells by activation of an NFkappaB-BCL10 loop.
PG  - 1300-7
LID - 10.1016/j.bbadis.2012.05.001 [doi]
AB  - Carrageenan, a sulfated polysaccharide that is widely used as a food additive,
      induces inflammatory responses in animal models and human cells. The
      carrageenan-induced inflammatory cascades involve toll-like receptor (TLR)4- and 
      B-cell leukemia/lymphoma (BCL)10-dependent activation of NF-kappaB, leading to
      increased IL-8 production. Translocations involving BCL10 in the
      mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas are associated with
      constitutive activation of NF-kappaB. This report presents a mechanism by which
      carrageenan exposure leads to prolonged activation of both BCL10 and NF-kappaB in
      human colonic epithelial cells. Study findings demonstrate that nuclear RelA and 
      RelB bind to an NF-kappaB binding motif in the BCL10 promoter in human colonic
      epithelial NCM460 and HT-29 cells. In vitro oligonucleotide binding assay,
      non-radioactive gel shift assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
      indicate binding of RelA and RelB to the BCL10 promoter. Prolonged inflammation
      follows activation of the BCL10-NFkappaB inflammatory loop in response to
      carrageenan, shown by increased BCL10, RelA, and IL-8 for 36 to 48h and increased
      RelB for 24h following withdrawal of carrageenan after 12h. In contrast, exposure
      to dextran sulfate sodium, which does not cause inflammation through TLR4 and
      BCL10 in the colonic epithelial cells, did not provoke prolonged activation of
      inflammation. The carrageenan-enhanced BCL10 promoter activity was blocked by
      caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) and MB-132 which inhibit NF-kappaB
      activation. These results indicate that NF-kappaB binding to the BCL10 promoter
      can lead to prolonged activation of the carrageenan-induced inflammatory cascade 
      by a transcriptional mechanism involving an NF-kappaB-BCL10 loop.

AB  - Symptomatic diverticular disease has a high prevalence in countries with a
      western lifestyle. Besides antibiotics for acute diverticulitis there are no
      established medical interventions to prevent or to treat symptomatic diverticular
      disease. Due to its broad spectrum of anti-inflammatory activities, mesalazine is
      a candidate for the treatment of symptomatic diverticular disease. A review of
      the literature shows that randomized open studies using various treatment designs
      suggest a protective role of mesalazine in preventing recurrences of
      diverticulitis. Currently, 5 randomized placebo-controlled trials are active
      which will clarify the role of mesalazine to prevent recurrence of diverticulitis
      in the near future. Several randomized uncontrolled studies suggest that
      mesalazine improves symptoms in patients with symptomatic uncomplicated
      diverticular disease. The analysis of secondary end points from two randomized
      placebo-controlled trials suggests that mesalazine improves symptoms in
      diverticular disease although both studies failed to show a statistically
      significant advantage for mesalazine for the primary study end point. In
      segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis no prospective systematic
      studies are available. However, several case reports show a high efficacy of
      mesalazine in segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis.

AB  - Psoriasis and inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis) are among the immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. This group includes
      approximately 80 disorders, some of which can at times be associated in a single 
      patient. In psoriasis, Crohn's disease may be observed slightly more frequently, 
      but ulcerative colitis and celiac disease are also an issue. The underlying
      relations between these disorders comprise: i) genetic data obtained by
      genome-wide association studies that show the involvement of shared predisposing 
      loci and/or genes, for example, in innate immunity; ii) immunological data: these
      disorders share inflammation effector mechanisms, particularly the activation
      pathway of Th17 lymphocytes, which explains the efficacy of anti-TNF antibodies
      and anti-IL-12/23; and iii) environmental co-factors such as smoking, possibly
      certain food proteins (gliadin, etc.), and bacterial infections that are probably
      decisive elements in the genesis of these diseases.

AB  - The widely used food additive carrageenan (CGN) has been shown to induce
      intestinal inflammation, ulcerative colitis-like symptoms, or neoplasm in the gut
      epithelia in animal models, which are also clinical features of human
      inflammatory bowel disease. In this study, the effects of CGN on pro-inflammatory
      transcription factors NF-kappaB and early growth response gene 1 product (EGR-1) 
      were evaluated in terms of human intestinal epithelial barrier integrity. Both
      pro-inflammatory transcription factors were elevated by CGN and only NF-kappaB
      activation was shown to be involved in the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokine
      interleukin-8. Moreover, the integrity of the in vitro epithelial monolayer under
      the CGN insult was maintained by both activated pro-inflammatory transcription
      factors NF-kappaB and EGR-1. Suppression of NF-kappaB or EGR-1 aggravated barrier
      disruption by CGN, which was associated with the reduced gene expression of tight
      junction component zonula occludens 1 and its irregular localization in the
      epithelial monolayer.

TI  - Advances in inflammatory bowel diseases in children.
PG  - 257-70
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic gastrointestinal condition that
      burdens the lives of many children around the world. It is characterized by
      chronic gastrointestinal inflammation. Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis
      and IBD-unknown are the three types of this disease. The management of children
      with inflammatory bowel disease is complex and requires skill, knowledge and
      experience with current advances in the field. Over the past several years, there
      have been a number of achievements and progress made in the care and management
      of this disorder. The diagnostic tools have greatly improved. The therapeutic
      armamentarium has expanded. The genetics of IBD has become more detailed and the 
      role of the gut microbiome has been better defined. The evolution of biological
      agents has revolutionized the way we approach this disease. This review
      highlights the recent advances in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease and
      provides an overview for clinicians caring for children with this disorder.

PG  - 1355-69
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2012.05104.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diarrhoea is a common occurrence in association with antibiotic
      administration. Earlier studies and meta-analyses have suggested that probiotic
      administration reduces the incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD).
      AIM: To estimate the reduction in risk of AAD with administration of probiotics
      in randomised placebo-controlled trials and to identify factors associated with
      such reduction. METHODS: Meta-analysis of randomised, double-blinded,
      placebo-controlled trials including patients treated with antibiotics and
      administered a probiotic for at least the duration of the antibiotic treatment.
      The outcome was incidence of diarrhoea irrespective of the presence of
      Clostridium difficile or the development of pseudomembranous colitis.
      Meta-analysis and meta-regression methods were used to synthesise data and to
      assess influence of: mean age, duration of antibiotics, risk of bias and
      incidence of diarrhoea in the placebo group on outcomes. Subgroup analyses
      explored effects of different probiotic species, patient populations and
      treatment indications. RESULTS: A total of 34 studies were included with 4138
      patients. The pooled relative risk (RR) for AAD in the probiotic group vs.
      placebo was 0.53 (95% CI 0.44-0.63), corresponding to a number needed to treat
      (NNT) of 8 (95% CI 7-11). The preventive effect of probiotics remained
      significant when grouped by probiotic species, population age group, relative
      duration of antibiotics and probiotics, study risk of bias and probiotic
      administered. The pooled RR for AAD during treatment for Helicobacter pylori (H. 
      pylori) was 0.37 (95% CI 0.20-0.69), corresponding to a NNT of 5 (95% CI 4-10).
      CONCLUSIONS: This updated meta-analysis confirms earlier results supporting the
      preventive effects of probiotics in AAD.

AB  - The intestinal microbiota has been linked to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD),
      and oral treatment with specific bacteria can ameliorate IBD. One bacterial
      mixture, VSL#3, containing Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Streptococcus, was
      clinically shown to reduce inflammation in IBD patients and normalize intestinal 
      levels of IP-10, a lymphocyte-recruiting chemokine, in a murine colitis model. We
      identified Lactobacillus paracasei prtP-encoded lactocepin as a protease that
      selectively degrades secreted, cell-associated, and tissue-distributed IP-10,
      resulting in significantly reduced lymphocyte recruitment after intraperitoneal
      injection in an ileitis model. A human Lactobacillus casei isolate was also found
      to encode lactocepin and degrade IP-10. L. casei feeding studies in a murine
      colitis model (T cell transferred Rag2(-/-) mice) revealed that a prtP-disruption
      mutant was significantly less potent in reducing IP-10 levels, T cell
      infiltration and inflammation in cecal tissue compared to the isogenic wild-type 
      strain. Thus, lactocepin-based therapies may be effective treatments for
      chemokine-mediated diseases like IBD.

AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD), collectively referred to as
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are chronic inflammatory disorders that can
      affect the gastrointestinal tract of children and adults. Like other autoimmune
      processes, the cause(s) of these disorders remain unknown but likely involves
      some interplay between genetic vulnerability and environmental factors. Children,
      in particular with UC or CD, can present to their primary care providers with
      similar symptoms, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and bloody
      stool. Although UC and CD are more predominant in adults, epidemiologic studies
      have demonstrated that a significant percentage of these patients were diagnosed 
      during childhood. The chronic nature of the inflammatory process observed in
      these children and the waxing and waning nature of their clinical symptoms can be
      especially disruptive to their physical, social, and academic development. As
      such, physicians caring for children must consider these diseases when evaluating
      patients with compatible symptoms. Recent research efforts have made available a 
      variety of more specific and effective pharmacologic agents and improved
      endoscopic and radiologic assessment tools to assist clinicians in the diagnosis 
      and interval assessment of their patients with IBD; however, as the level of
      complexity of these interventions has increased, so too has the need for
      practitioners to become familiar with a wider array of treatments and the risks
      and benefits of particular diagnostic testing. Nonetheless, in most cases, and
      especially when frequent visits to subspecialty referral centers are not
      geographically feasible, primary care providers can be active participants in the
      management of their pediatric patients with IBD. The goal of this article is to
      educate and assist pediatricians and adult gastroenterology physicians caring for
      children with IBD, and in doing so, help to develop more collaborative care plans
      between primary care and subspecialty providers.

TI  - Probiotics in the management of inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review
      of intervention studies in adult patients.
PG  - 803-23

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Mounting evidence suggests an important role for the intestinal
      microbiota in the chronic mucosal inflammation that occurs in inflammatory bowel 
      disease (IBD), and novel molecular approaches have further identified a dysbiosis
      in these patients. Several mechanisms of action of probiotic products that may
      interfere with possible aetiological factors in IBD have been postulated.
      OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to discuss the rationale for probiotics in IBD and
      to systematically review clinical intervention studies with probiotics in the
      management of IBD in adults. METHODS: A systematic search was performed in PubMed
      up to 1 October 2011, using defined keywords. Only full-text papers in the
      English language addressing clinical outcomes in adult patients were included.
      The 41 eligible studies were categorized on disease type (ulcerative colitis [UC]
      with/without an ileo-anal pouch and Crohn's disease [CD]) and disease activity.
      Pooled odds ratios were only calculated per probiotic for a specific patient
      group when more than one randomized controlled trial was available. RESULTS: Well
      designed randomized controlled trials supporting the application of probiotics in
      the management of IBD are still limited. Meta-analyses could only be performed
      for a limited number of studies revealing overall risk ratios of 2.70 (95% CI
      0.47, 15.33) for inducing remission in active UC with Bifido-fermented milk
      versus placebo or no additive treatment (n = 2); 1.88 (95% CI 0.96, 3.67) for
      inducing remission in active UC with VSL#3 versus placebo (n = 2); 1.08 (95% CI
      0.86, 1.37) for preventing relapses in inactive UC with Escherichia coli Nissle
      1917 versus standard treatment (n = 3); 0.17 (95% CI 0.09, 0.33) for preventing
      relapses in inactive UC/ileo-anal pouch anastomosis (IPAA) patients with VSL#3
      versus placebo; 1.21 (95% CI 0.57, 2.57) for preventing endoscopic recurrences in
      inactive CD with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG versus placebo (n = 2); and 0.93 (95%
      CI 0.63, 1.38) for preventing endoscopic recurrences in inactive CD with
      Lactobacillus johnsonii versus placebo (n = 2). CONCLUSION: Further well designed
      studies based on intention-to-treat analyses by several independent research
      groups are still warranted to support the promising results for E. coli Nissle in
      inactive UC and the multispecies product VSL#3 in active UC and inactive pouch
      patients. So far, no evidence is available to support the use of probiotics in
      CD. Future studies should focus on specific disease subtypes and disease
      location. Further insight into the aetiology of IBD and the mechanisms of
      probiotic strains will aid in selecting probiotic strains for specific disease
      entities and disease locations.

      diseases.

LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201100630 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), Crohn's disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis 
      (UC) are chronic inflammatory conditions, which are increasing in incidence,
      prevalence, and severity, in many countries. While there is genetic
      susceptibility to IBD, the probability of disease development is modified by
      diet, lifestyle, and endogenous factors, including the gut microbiota. For
      example, high intakes of mono- and disaccharides, and total fats consistently
      increases the risk developing both forms of IBD. High vegetable intake reduces
      the risk of UC, whereas increased fruit and/or dietary fiber intake appears
      protective against CD. Low levels of certain micronutrients, especially vitamin
      D, may increase the risk of both diseases. Dietary patterns may be even more
      important to disease susceptibility than the levels of individual foods or
      nutrients. Various dietary regimes may modify disease symptoms, in part through
      their actions on the host microbiota. Both probiotics and prebiotics may modulate
      the microflora, and reduce the likelihood of IBD regression. However, other
      dietary factors affect the microbiota in different ways. Distinguishing cause
      from effect, and characterizing the relative roles of human and microbial genes, 
      diet, age of onset, gender, life style, smoking history, ethnic background,
      environmental exposures, and medications, will require innovative and
      internationally integrated approaches.

TI  - Salmonella transiently reside in luminal neutrophils in the inflamed gut.
PG  - e34812
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0034812 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Enteric pathogens need to grow efficiently in the gut lumen in order 
      to cause disease and ensure transmission. The interior of the gut forms a complex
      environment comprising the mucosal surface area and the inner gut lumen with
      epithelial cell debris and food particles. Recruitment of neutrophils to the
      intestinal lumen is a hallmark of non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica infections in
      humans. Here, we analyzed the interaction of gut luminal neutrophils with S.
      enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Tm) in a mouse colitis model. RESULTS: Upon S.
      Tm(wt) infection, neutrophils transmigrate across the mucosa into the intestinal 
      lumen. We detected a majority of pathogens associated with luminal neutrophils 20
      hours after infection. Neutrophils are viable and actively engulf S. Tm, as
      demonstrated by live microscopy. Using S. Tm mutant strains defective in tissue
      invasion we show that pathogens are mostly taken up in the gut lumen at the
      epithelial barrier by luminal neutrophils. In these luminal neutrophils, S. Tm
      induces expression of genes typically required for its intracellular lifestyle
      such as siderophore production iroBCDE and the Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 
      encoded type three secretion system (TTSS-2). This shows that S. Tm at least
      transiently survives and responds to engulfment by gut luminal neutrophils.
      Gentamicin protection experiments suggest that the life-span of luminal
      neutrophils is limited and that S. Tm is subsequently released into the gut
      lumen. This "fast cycling" through the intracellular compartment of gut luminal
      neutrophils would explain the high fraction of TTSS-2 and iroBCDE expressing
      intra- and extracellular bacteria in the lumen of the infected gut. CONCLUSION:
      In conclusion, live neutrophils recruited during acute S. Tm colitis engulf
      pathogens in the gut lumen and may thus actively engage in shaping the
      environment of pathogens and commensals in the inflamed gut.

      research, and goals.
PG  - 962-74
LID - 10.3945/jn.112.158147 [doi]
AB  - First defined in the mid-1990s, prebiotics, which alter the composition and
      activity of gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota to improve health and well-being,
      have generated scientific and consumer interest and regulatory debate. The Life
      Sciences Research Organization, Inc. (LSRO) held a workshop, Prebiotics and the
      Health Benefits of Fiber: Future Research and Goals, in February 2011 to assess
      the current state of the science and the international regulatory environment for
      prebiotics, identify research gaps, and create a strategy for future research. A 
      developing body of evidence supports a role for prebiotics in reducing the risk
      and severity of GI infection and inflammation, including diarrhea, inflammatory
      bowel disease, and ulcerative colitis as well as bowel function disorders,
      including irritable bowel syndrome. Prebiotics also increase the bioavailability 
      and uptake of minerals and data suggest that they reduce the risk of obesity by
      promoting satiety and weight loss. Additional research is needed to define the
      relationship between the consumption of different prebiotics and improvement of
      human health. New information derived from the characterization of the
      composition and function of different prebiotics as well as the interactions
      among and between gut microbiota and the human host would improve our
      understanding of the effects of prebiotics on health and disease and could assist
      in surmounting regulatory issues related to prebiotic use.

TI  - Decreased mucosal sulfide detoxification is related to an impaired butyrate
      oxidation in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 2371-80
LID - 10.1002/ibd.22949 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Defective detoxification of sulfides leads to damage to the mucosa
      and may play a role in the etiology of ulcerative colitis (UC). The colonic
      mucosal thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (TST) enzyme removes H(2) S by conversion
      to the less toxic thiocyanate. In this study we measured colonic mucosal TST
      enzyme activity and gene expression in UC and controls. In addition, the
      influence of sulfides on butyrate oxidation was evaluated. METHODS: Colonic
      mucosal biopsies were collected from 92 UC patients and 24 controls. TST activity
      was measured spectrophotometrically. To assess gene expression, total RNA from
      biopsies was used for quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain
      reaction (RT-PCR). In 20 UC patients, gene expression was reassessed after their 
      first treatment with infliximab. To evaluate the effect of sulfides on butyrate
      oxidation, biopsies were incubated with 1.5 mM NaHS. RESULTS: TST enzyme activity
      and gene expression were significantly decreased in UC patients vs. controls (P <
      0.001). UC patients, classified into disease activity subgroups, showed a
      significantly decreased TST activity and gene expression in the subgroups as
      compared to healthy subjects (P < 0.05 for all). In 20 patients, gene expression 
      was reassessed after their first infliximab therapy. In responders to infliximab,
      a significant increase in TST gene expression was observed. However, TST mRNA
      levels did not return to control values after therapy in the responders. In
      controls, but not in UC, sulfide significantly decreased butyrate oxidation.
      CONCLUSIONS: We found an impaired detoxification mechanism of sulfide at TST
      protein and RNA level in UC. Inflammation was clearly associated with the
      observed TST deficiency.

TI  - Peracetylated (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (AcEGCG) potently suppresses dextran
      sulfate sodium-induced colitis and colon tumorigenesis in mice.
PG  - 3441-51
LID - 10.1021/jf300441p [doi]
AB  - Previous studies reported that peracetylated (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate
      (AcEGCG) has antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory activities. Here, we
      evaluated the chemopreventive effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of
      dietary administration of AcEGCG and EGCG in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced
      colitis in mice. The mice were fed a diet supplemented with either AcEGCG or EGCG
      prior to DSS induction. Our results indicated that AcEGCG administration was more
      effective than EGCG in preventing the shortening of colon length and the
      formation of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) and lymphoid nodules (LN) in mouse colon
      stimulated by DSS. Our study observes that AcEGCG treatment inhibited histone 3
      lysine 9 (H3K9) acetylation but did not affect histone acetyltransferase (HAT)
      activity and acetyl- CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300 levels. In addition,
      pretreatment with AcEGCG decreased the proinflammatory mediator levels by
      down-regulating of PI3K/Akt/NFkappaB phosphorylation and p65 acetylation. We also
      found that treatment with AcEGCG increased heme oxygenase-1(HO-1) expression via 
      activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK)1/2 signaling
      and acetylation of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), thereby abating DSS-induced
      colitis. Moreover, dietary feeding with AcEGCG markedly reduced colitis-driven
      colon cancer in mice. Taken together, these results demonstrated for the first
      time the in vivo chemopreventive efficacy and molecular mechanisms of dietary
      AcEGCG against inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and potentially colon cancer
      associated with colitis. These findings provide insight into the biological
      actions of AcEGCG and might establish a molecular basis for the development of
      new cancer chemopreventive agents.

PG  - 139-48
LID - 10.3810/hp.2012.02.954 [doi]
AB  - Clostridium difficile has become an increasingly important nosocomial pathogen
      and is one of the most common causes of hospital-acquired diarrhea. The incidence
      of C difficile infection (CDI) is increasing worldwide. Overuse of antibiotics is
      felt to be a major contributing factor leading to the increased incidence of CDI.
      The clinical manifestations of CDI vary from a mild form of the disease to
      fulminant diarrhea, leading to significant patient morbidity and mortality. The
      increasing incidence of CDI has a major impact on increasing health care costs.
      This article will summarize the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical
      manifestations, laboratory diagnosis, and treatment options for CDI, as well as
      infection-control measures for the prevention of CDI.

TI  - Comparison between a bovine and a human enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli
      strain of serogroup O26 by suppressive subtractive hybridization reveals the
      presence of atypical factors in EHEC and EPEC strains.
PG  - 132-9
LID - 10.1111/j.1574-6968.2012.02542.x [doi]
AB  - Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) strains are responsible for food
      poisoning in humans in developed countries via consumption of vegetal and animal 
      foodstuffs contaminated by ruminant feces. The clinical conditions caused by EHEC
      strains vary from undifferentiated diarrhea to hemorrhagic colitis with, in a few
      cases, the appearance of the hemolytic uremic syndrome, which can lead to death. 
      Most EHEC strains can be found in the gut of healthy ruminants, but some of the
      strains, belonging to O26, O111, O118 serogroups, for example, are also
      responsible for digestive disorders in calves. The aim of this research was to
      study the genomic differences between two EHEC strains of serogroup O26 isolated 
      from a young calf and a human with diarrhea, to identify specific sequences of
      the bovine strain that could be implicated in initial adherence or host
      specificity. No sequence implicated in host specificity was found during our
      study. Finally, several factors, not usually present in EHEC strains of serogroup
      O26, were identified in the bovine strain. One of them, the PAI I(CL3) locus
      initially presented as a marker for LEE-negative VTEC strains, was found in 11.3%
      of EPEC and EHEC strains.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Physical activity is important for muscle and bone strength 
      in the growing child and may be impaired in paediatric patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) even during quiescent disease. The SenseWearPro(2) armband
      allows to measure physical activity under everyday life conditions. METHODS:
      Thirty-nine IBD patients (27 Crohn's disease, 12 ulcerative colitis, 24 boys) in 
      remission (n=26) or with only mild disease activity (n=13) were compared to 39
      healthy age and sex-matched controls. Body weight, height, body mass index (BMI),
      lean body mass as phase angle alpha (determined by bioelectrical impedance
      analysis), and dynamometric grip force were expressed as age- and sex-related
      Z-scores. SenseWearPro(2) armbands were applied for three consecutive days to
      record number of steps, duration of physical activity and sleeping time. Quality 
      of life was assessed with the German KINDL and IMPACT III questionnaires, energy 
      intake with prospective food protocols. Differences between patients and
      pair-matched controls were analysed by paired t-test. RESULTS: Patients showed
      lower Z-scores for phase angle alpha (difference -0.72; 95% CI [-1.10; -0.34])
      and lower grip strength (-1.02 [-1.58; -0.47]) than controls. They tended towards
      lesser number of steps per day (-1339 [-2760; 83]) and shorter duration of
      physical activity (-0.44 h [-0.94; 0.06]), particularly in females and patients
      with mild disease. Quality of life and energy intake did not differ between
      patients and controls. CONCLUSION: In spite of quiescent disease lean body mass
      and physical activity were reduced. Interventions to encourage physical activity 
      may be beneficial in this lifelong disease.

TI  - Prevention of postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 637-46
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2011.12.006 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Up to 75% of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) will have intestinal 
      resection during their life. Most patients will, however, develop postoperative
      recurrence (endoscopic, clinical or surgical). Several medical and surgical
      strategies have been attempted to prevent postoperative recurrence. This review
      evaluates the efficacy of different drug regimens and surgical techniques in the 
      prevention of clinical, endoscopic and surgical postoperative recurrence of CD.
      METHODS: A literature search for randomized controlled trials on medical or
      surgical interventions was performed. The endpoints for efficacy were clinical,
      endoscopic and surgical recurrence. Meta-analyses were performed in case two or
      more RCTs evaluated the same drug or surgical technique. RESULTS: Mesalamine is
      more effective in preventing clinical recurrence than placebo (P=0,012), as well 
      as nitroimidazolic antibiotics at one year follow-up (P<0.001) and thiopurines
      (P=0.018). Nitroimidazolic antibiotics are also more effective than placebo in
      preventing endoscopic recurrence (P=0.037), as well as thiopurines (P=0.015) and 
      infliximab (P=0.006). Budenoside, probiotics, Interleukin-10 nor any of the
      different surgical procedures showed any significant difference compared to
      placebo in postoperative recurrence rates of CD. CONCLUSION: Among the different 
      drug regimens and surgical techniques, only thiopurines and nitroimidazolic
      antibiotics are able to reduce postoperative clinical as well as endoscopic
      recurrence of CD. Mesalamine and infliximab also seem to be superior to placebo
      in preventing clinical recurrence and endoscopic recurrence, respectively. There 
      is a paucity of trials evaluating long-term follow-up and prevention of surgical 
      recurrence of CD.

TI  - Risedronate improves bone mineral density in Crohn's disease: a two year
      randomized controlled clinical trial.
PG  - 777-86
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2012.01.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with Crohn's disease have an increased frequency of
      osteopenia and osteoporosis. This randomized, controlled, double-blind study
      assessed the efficacy of risedronate versus placebo in treating low bone mineral 
      density (BMD) in patients with Crohn's disease. METHODS: 88 Crohn's disease
      outpatients with BMD T-score<-1.0 by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry were
      randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups for the two year study duration:
      one group received risedronate 35 mg weekly while another received placebo. Both 
      groups received daily calcium (Ca; 500 mg) and vitamin D (D; 400 IU)
      supplementation. Percent change in BMD relative to baseline was compared between 
      the two therapies at 12 and 24 months. RESULTS: Using intent-to-treat analysis,
      at 12 months, risedronate+Ca+D increased BMD, relative to baseline, more than
      placebo+Ca+D in the femoral trochanter (1.4+/-3.4% vs -0.1+/-3.1%; p=0.03) and
      total hip (1.1+/-2.7% vs -0.1+/-2.5%;p=0.04). This trend in greater BMD continued
      for the 24 month duration of the study. There was no difference between the two
      treatment groups for changes in spine BMD. Subgroup analysis revealed that
      risedronate+Ca+D resulted in significantly better improvement in femoral
      trochanter BMD in non-smokers (p=0.01), males (p=0.01), those with a history of
      corticosteroid use in the preceding year (p=0.01), and current users of
      immunosuppressants (p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Risedronate, in addition to daily
      calcium and vitamin D supplementation, is superior to calcium and vitamin D alone
      in improving femoral trochanter and total hip BMD in patients with Crohn's
      disease.

TI  - Vitamin D as a therapy for colitis: a systematic review.
PG  - 405-11
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2012.01.007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: The effect of vitamin D supplementation on immune disorders
      has been a topical research focus. The aim of this systematic review was to
      examine the current evidence of the effect of vitamin D supplementation as a
      therapy for colitis. METHODS: The following databases were searched: MEDLINE,
      Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Knowledge, Cinicaltrials.gov and the Cochrane Central
      Register of Controlled Trials using the terms 'inflammatory bowel disease'
      'Crohn's disease' 'ulcerative colitis' 'colitis' [and] 'vitamin D'. Both human
      and animal studies published in English language were examined. The reference
      lists of included studies and review articles were manually searched for any
      relevant studies. RESULTS: Four studies were included in this systematic review. 
      All reported an improvement in disease activity with vitamin D supplementation.
      The only high quality human study reported a non-significant reduction of relapse
      rate for Crohn's disease. No major adverse effects of vitamin D supplementation
      were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is some evidence that supplemental
      vitamin D, as an adjunctive treatment, may help in controlling colitis, this
      evidence is not enough to justify using vitamin D in treating inflammatory bowel 
      disease (IBD). Large high quality placebo-controlled randomised controlled trials
      are needed to explore a possible benefit of using vitamin D in treating IBD.

TI  - Management of inflammatory bowel disease with vitamin D: beyond bone health.
PG  - 397-404
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2011.10.015 [doi]
AB  - A relationship between vitamin D and several disorders, including Crohn's disease
      (CD), has recently been proposed. Vitamin D appears to have several important
      actions beyond the maintenance of bone health, including various effects on the
      immune system. Vitamin D deficiency has been implicated in the development of CD,
      and its analogues may have a role in the treatment of CD. Current research also
      suggests a role for vitamin D in counteracting some IBD-specific complications,
      including osteopenia, colorectal neoplasia, and depression. There remains a need 
      for prospective studies to further delineate these relationships. Given current
      evidence and the apparent safety of vitamin D supplementation, it appears
      reasonable to screen for and treat vitamin D deficiency in patients with IBD.

      changes of intestinal flora in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). During
      enterohepatic circulation, the intestinal micro flora cause 7
      alpha-dehydroxylation of cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA),
      yielding deoxycholic acid(DCA) and lithocholic acid, respectively. The aim of the
      present study was to investigate the effects of probiotics in patients with UC by
      examining changes of the serum BA profile. METHODOLOGY: Twenty-seven patients
      were divided into the following 2 groups based on endoscopic findings: Fifteen
      patients with distal UC (dUC group) and 12 patients with pancolitis (pUC group). 
      After treatment with mesalazine or salazosulfapyridine (5-ASA), all patients
      achieved remission. Then they were given 5-ASA plus the probiotic Clostridium
      butyricum Miyairi (3.0 g/day) for 4 weeks. RESULTS: After 4 weeks of probiotic
      treatment, %CDCA was significantly higher and %DCA was significantly lower in the
      pUC group than in the HV group. In contrast, the dUC group showed no significant 
      differences of %CDCA or %DCA from the HV group after 4 weeks. CONCLUSIONS:
      Probiotic therapy restored intestinal flora involved in 7 alpha-dehydroxylation
      in the dUC group, but not in the pUC group.

TI  - Characterization of a probiotic-derived soluble protein which reveals a mechanism

      diseases.
PG  - 25-8

AB  - The beneficial effects of probiotics have been demonstrated in many diseases,
      such as inflammatory bowel disease. The known mechanisms for probiotic action
      include blocking pathogenic bacterial effects, enhancing the innate immunity and 
      decreasing pathogen-induced inflammation, and promoting intestinal epithelial
      cell survival, barrier function, and protective responses. We purified and cloned
      a Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG)-derived soluble protein, p40. This protein
      ameliorated cytokine-induced apoptosis in intestinal epithelial cells through
      activation of the EGF receptor and its down-stream target, Akt. By using special 
      hydrogel beads to protect p40 from degradation, we showed that p40 reduced
      intestinal epithelial apoptosis and preserved barrier function in the colon
      epithelium in an EGF receptor-dependent manner, thereby preventing and treating
      intestinal inflammation in mouse models of colitis. Further works regarding
      structural analysis of p40, regulation of EGF receptor activation and
      immunoregulatory effects by p40 are discussed. These results may provide insights
      into the clinical application of probiotics for intestinal inflammatory
      disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been
      conducted to determine therapeutic efficacy of the biological agents for the
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). However, the external validity of findings
      from RCTs might be compromised by their stringent selection criteria. We
      investigated the proportion of patients encountered during routine clinical
      practice who would qualify for enrollment into a pivotal RCT of biological agents
      for IBD. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of adult patients
      with moderate-severe IBD who presented to a tertiary referral center. Inclusion
      and exclusion criteria were extracted from published RCTs of biologics approved
      by the Food and Drug Administration and applied to the study population. RESULTS:
      Only 31.1% of 206 patients with IBD (34% with Crohn's disease [CD], 26% with
      ulcerative colitis) would have been eligible to participate in any of the
      selected RCTs. Patients would have been excluded because they had stricturing or 
      penetrating CD, took high doses of steroids, had comorbidities or prior exposure 
      to biologics, or received topical therapies. Of the trial-ineligible patients
      with ulcerative colitis, 23.3% had colectomies, and 31.7% received infliximab,
      with a 63.2% response rate. Approximately half (49.4%) of the 82 trial-ineligible
      patients with CD received biological therapies, with lower response rates (60%)
      than trial-eligible patients (89%; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with
      moderate-severe IBD evaluated in an outpatient practice would not qualify for
      enrollment in a pivotal RCT of biological reagents; this finding raises important
      questions about their therapeutic efficacy beyond the clinical trial populations.
      Additional evaluation of the transparency of RCT design and selection criteria is
      needed to determine whether trial results can be generalized to the population.

AB  - Adverse reactions to cow's milk in the first year of life occur in 2-7%. There is
      an increase in the incidence of cow's milk protein allergy (CMA) in newborn
      population including premature infants. We report two cases of CMA in preterm
      twins. The first one developed recurrent episodes of proctocolitis and the second
      one two necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) -like episodes. Our cases demonstrate
      different clinical presentations of the same disease and add to literature the
      peculiarity of the early onset, the recurrence of episodes of enterocolitis
      associated with increasing systemic eosinophilia and episodes clinically and
      radiologically mimicking NEC.

TI  - Prevalence and genetic characteristics of Shigatoxigenic Escherichia coli from
      patients with diarrhoea in Maasailand, Kenya.
PG  - 102-8
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Shigatoxigenic Escherichia coli strains are food-borne bacterial
      pathogens that may cause haemorrhagic colitis (HC) in humans which can lead to
      life-threatening systemic complication, including haemolytic uremic syndrome
      (HUS). This study aimed to characterize and analyze virulence properties of
      pathogenic E. coli isolates among patients with diarrhoea from a Maasai community
      in Kenya. METHODOLOGY: Stool samples from 380 patients of all ages from the
      Kajiado and Narok districts of Kenya were investigated for the presence of
      enteric bacterial pathogens by conventional and molecular methods. RESULTS:
      Bacterial diarrhoea was diagnosed in 141/380 (37.1%) cases, of which
      enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) compromised 29.8%, shigatoxigenic E. coli (STEC)
      24.1%, enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) 14.2%, enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC)
      12.8% and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) 3.5%. Gene analysis for STEC virulence 
      factors showed that 52.9% isolates carried stx1, 29.4% possessed stx2, 14.7%
      carried both stx1 and stx2, and 2.9% had stx2e. 23.5% isolates carried
      enterohaemolysin and 20.5% isolates possessed the Intimin gene. From 9 strains
      that exhibited adherence, 7 contained both Intimin and Haemolysin genes.
      Infections with Intimin-positive STEC strains (46%) were more frequent in
      patients with bloody diarrhoea, especially in children under 5 years of age,
      whereas Intimin-negative STEC infections dominated in adults. CONCLUSION:
      Although STEC infection as a cause of bloody diarrhoea has not attracted much
      attention as a medical problem in Kenya, our findings indicate that this is a
      problem that must be investigated. The 24.1% isolation rate of STEC among the
      Maasai is one of the highest reported rates worldwide.

PG  - 182-8
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2011.08.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Vitamin D deficiency impacts on bone health and has
      potential new roles in inflammation. We aimed to determine the prevalence of and 
      risk factors for vitamin D deficiency and to explore vitamin D supplement usage
      in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) in an outpatient setting, compared with
      controls. METHODS: Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations were
      measured by radioimmunoassay in 151 participants, comprising 81 CD patients and
      70 age-, sex- and socio-economic status-matched healthy controls. Levels of
      25(OH)D <50 nmol/L were classed as deficient. Data on vitamin supplement usage
      were recorded for all participants at interview. RESULTS: Vitamin D deficiency
      was common in patients with CD (63%) and significantly higher in winter than
      summer (68% v 50%; p<0.001, chi(2)). Notably, the deficiency rate remained high
      even in summer (50%). On regression analysis, 25(OH)D levels were inversely
      associated with winter season. Disease-specific factors for lower serum 25(OH)D
      levels were longer disease duration and smoking. Overall, 43% of patients
      reported using a vitamin D-containing supplement, primarily at low dosages
      (200-400 IU/d); however, this level of supplement did not prevent deficiency. For
      the majority of CD patients, 25(OH)D remained below optimal levels proposed to
      confer bone and immune health benefits. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency was
      common in patients with CD and associated with longstanding disease, smoking and 
      winter. While over 40% of patients used a vitamin D-containing supplement, the
      dosages were inadequate to prevent deficiency. Appropriate vitamin D screening
      and supplementation should be considered in the context of health promotion of
      outpatients with CD.

TI  - Role of serological markers of activated eosinophils in inflammatory bowel
      diseases.
PG  - 393-7
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0b013e328350f91f [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Activated eosinophils can infiltrate the intestinal mucosa in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and eosinophils are also
      implicated in the histological damage seen in allergic diseases. AIM: To assess, 
      in a group of patients with IBD in remission or with a mild disease activity,
      whether serological markers of eosinophil activation, eosinophil cationic protein
      (ECP) and eosinophil protein X (EPX), are related to evidence of IgE
      hypersensitivity and to the eosinophilia in gut mucosa. METHODS: Sixty-one
      patients with IBD (21 Crohn's disease and 40 ulcerative colitis) in remission or 
      with a mild disease activity were screened for IgE hypersensitivity and
      serological levels of ECP and EPX. Colonic biopsies were taken to assess mucosal 
      eosinophilic infiltration. RESULTS: Skin prick test were positive in 31.1% of the
      patients with IBD, showing skin reactions to food allergens in 17.7%. Skin prick 
      test findings were unrelated to ECP or EPX levels, or to clinical activity or
      eosinophil counts in the gut mucosa. A significant correlation was found between 
      ECP and EPX levels (r=0.77; P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: Serological ECP and EPX
      findings did not correlate with IgE hypersensitivity findings or eosinophilic
      colonic infiltration in patients with IBD in remission or with mild disease
      activity. The role of eosinophils in IBD needs to be better characterized in the 
      colonic mucosa, instead of relying on serological tests.

TI  - Probiotics as an alternative strategy for prevention and treatment of human
      diseases: a review.
PG  - 79-89
AB  - Probiotics are live microbial food supplements or their components, which have
      been shown to have beneficial effects on human health. Probiotics can be
      bacteria, molds, or yeasts, but most of them fall into the group known as lactic 
      acid bacteria and are normally consumed in the form of yogurt, fermented milk, or
      other fermented foods. Data from clinical trials have shown contrasting effects
      and should be interpreted with caution. A large variety of potential beneficial
      effects have been reported including improvement of intestinal tract health,
      enhancing the immune system, reducing symptoms of lactose intolerance, decreasing
      the prevalence of allergy in susceptible individuals, reducing risk of certain
      cancers, treating colitis, lowering serum cholesterol concentrations, reducing
      blood pressure in hypertensives, and improving female urogenital infections and
      Helicobacter pylori infections. The aim of this article is to present a review of
      the current expanding knowledge of applications of utilizing probiotic
      microorganisms in the prevention and treatment of several diseases.

TI  - Inulin and fructo-oligosaccharides have divergent effects on colitis and

AB  - Modulation of intestinal microbiota by non-digestible carbohydrates may reduce
      inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of the present study
      was to assess the effects of inulin and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) on
      intestinal microbiota and colitis in HLA-B27 transgenic rats, a well-validated
      rodent model for IBD. In this study, 4-week-old rats were fed 8 g/kg body weight 
      inulin or FOS for 12 weeks, or not. Faeces were collected at 4 and 16 weeks of
      age; and caecal samples were collected at necropsy. The effects of inulin and FOS
      on chronic intestinal inflammation were assessed using a gross gut score,
      histology score and levels of mucosal IL-1beta. Intestinal microbiota were
      characterised by quantitative PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
      Colitis was significantly reduced in all FOS-fed rats compared to the control
      diet, whereas inulin decreased chronic intestinal inflammation in only half the
      number of animals. Quantitative analysis of caecal microbiota demonstrated that
      inulin increased the numbers of total bacteria and the
      Bacteroides-Prevotella-Porphyromonas group, FOS increased bifidobacteria, and
      both fructans decreased Clostridium cluster XI. In the faecal samples, both
      inulin and FOS decreased total bacteria, Bacteroides-Prevotella-Porphyromonas
      group, and Clostridium clusters XI and XIVa. FOS increased Bifidobacterium spp., 
      and mediated a decrease of gene copies of Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridium
      difficile toxin B in faeces. SCFA concentrations in the faecal and caecal samples
      were unaffected by the diets. In conclusion, FOS increased the abundance of
      Bifidobacterium spp., whereas both fructans reduced Clostridium cluster XI and C.
      difficile toxin gene expression, correlating with a reduction of chronic
      intestinal inflammation.

TI  - Aluminum as an adjuvant in Crohn's disease induction.
PG  - 231-8
LID - 10.1177/0961203311430090 [doi]
AB  - Alum (AlK(SO(4))(2)) is an adjuvant commonly utilized in vaccines, and is a
      ubiquitous element used extensively in contemporary life. Food, air, water,
      waste, the earth's surface, and pharmaceuticals all represent pathways of
      aluminum (Al) exposure. Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic relapsing intestinal
      inflammation in genetically susceptible individuals and is caused by yet
      unidentified environmental factors. Al is a potential factor for the induction of
      inflammation in CD, and its immune activities share many characteristics with the
      immune pathology of CD: many luminal bacterial or dietary compounds can be
      adsorbed to the metal surface and induce Th1 profile cytokines, shared
      cytokines/chemokines, co-stimulatory molecules, and intracellular pathways and
      stress-related molecular expression enhancement, affecting intestinal macrobiota,
      trans-mural granuloma formation, and colitis induction in an animal CD model. The
      inflammasome plays a central role in Al mode of action and in CD pathophysiology.
      It is suggested that Al adjuvant activity can fit between the aberrations of
      innate and adaptive immune responses occurring in CD. The CD mucosa is confronted
      with numerous inappropriate bacterial components adsorbed on the Al compound
      surface, constituting a pro-inflammatory supra-adjuvant. Al fits the diagnostic
      criteria of the newly described autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by
      adjuvants. If a cause and effect relationship can be established, the
      consequences will greatly impact public health and CD prevention and management.

TI  - A double, long polar fimbria mutant of Escherichia coli O157:H7 expresses Curli
      and exhibits reduced in vivo colonization.
PG  - 914-20
LID - 10.1128/IAI.05945-11 [doi]
AB  - Escherichia coli O157:H7 causes food and waterborne enteric infections that can
      result in hemorrhagic colitis and life-threatening hemolytic uremic syndrome.
      Intimate adherence of the bacteria to intestinal epithelial cells is mediated by 
      intimin, but E. coli O157:H7 also possess several other putative adhesins,
      including curli and two operons that encode long polar fimbriae (Lpf). To assess 
      the importance of Lpf for intestinal colonization, we performed competition
      experiments between E. coli O157:H7 and an isogenic DeltalpfA1 DeltalpfA2 double 
      mutant in the infant rabbit model. The mutant was outcompeted in the ileum,
      cecum, and midcolon, suggesting that Lpf contributes to intestinal colonization. 
      In contrast, the DeltalpfA1 DeltalpfA2 mutant showed increased adherence to
      colonic epithelial cells in vitro. Transmission electron microscopy revealed
      curli-like structures on the surface of the DeltalpfA1 DeltalpfA2 mutant, and the
      presence of curli was confirmed by Congo red binding, immunogold-labeling
      electron microscopy, immunoblotting, and quantitative real-time reverse
      transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) measuring csgA expression. However, deletion of csgA,
      which encodes the major curli subunit, does not appear to affect intestinal
      colonization. In addition to suggesting that Lpf can contribute to EHEC
      intestinal colonization, our observations indicate that the regulatory pathways
      governing the expression of Lpf and curli are interdependent.

TI  - Milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor 8 is decreased in intestinal epithelium 
      of ulcerative colitis patients and thereby causes increased apoptosis and
      impaired wound healing.
PG  - 497-506
LID - 10.2119/molmed.2011.00369 [doi]
AB  - Milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor 8 (MFG-E8) plays an important role in
      maintaining intestinal barrier homeostasis and accelerating intestinal
      restitution. However, studies of MFG-E8 expression in humans with ulcerative
      colitis are lacking. We examined MFG-E8 expression in colonic mucosal biopsies
      from ulcerative colitis patients and healthy controls (n = 26 each) by real-time 
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Western blot analysis and
      immunohistochemistry. MFG-E8 mRNA and protein expression was lower in ulcerative 
      colitis patients than in controls. MFG-E8 expression was inversely correlated
      with mucosal inflammatory activity and clinical disease activity in patients.
      MFG-E8 was present in human intestinal epithelial cells both in vivo and in
      vitro. Apoptosis induction was also detected in the intestinal epithelium of
      ulcerative colitis patients by terminal-deoxynucleoitidyl transferase mediated
      nick-end labeling assay. We used lentiviral vectors encoding human MFG-E8
      targeting short hairpin RNA to obtain MFG-E8 knockdown intestinal epithelia cell 
      clones. MFG-E8 knockdown could promote apoptosis in intestinal epithelial cell
      lines, accompanied by a decrease in level of the antiapoptotic protein B-cell
      lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) and induction of the proapoptotic protein BCL2-associated
      protein X (BAX). The addition of recombinant human MFG-E8 led to decreased BAX
      and cleaved caspase-3 levels and induction of BCL-2 level in intestinal epithelia
      cells. MFG-E8 knockdown also attenuated wound healing on scratch assay of
      intestinal epithelial cells. The mRNA level of intestinal trefoid factor 3, a
      pivotal factor in intestinal epithelial cell migration and restitution, was
      downregulated with MFG-E8 knockdown. In conclusion, we demonstrated that
      decreased colonic MFG-E8 expression in patients with ulcerative colitis may be
      associated with mucosal inflammatory activity and clinical disease activity
      through basal cell apoptosis and preventing tissue healing in the pathogenesis of
      ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens M1 isolated from milk kefir grains ameliorates
      experimental colitis in vitro and in vivo.
PG  - 63-74
LID - 10.3168/jds.2011-4696 [doi]
AB  - Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens M1, isolated from and identified in Taiwanese milk 
      kefir grain, has demonstrated immune-modulating activity. In the present study,
      we further investigated the effects of Lb. kefiranofaciens M1 on intestinal
      epithelial cells in vitro and on dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in 
      vivo. The possible mechanisms regarding the cytokine products and intestinal
      epithelial barrier restoration as well as the putative receptor for the
      protective effects of Lb. kefiranofaciens M1 were investigated. In vitro results 
      indicated that Lb. kefiranofaciens M1 could strengthen the epithelial barrier
      function in vitro by increasing the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) 
      and significantly upregulated the level of the chemokine CCL-20 at both the
      apical and basolateral sites. The in vivo effects of Lb. kefiranofaciens M1 on
      the regulation of intestinal physiology indicate that this strain could
      ameliorate DSS-induced colitis with a significant attenuation of the bleeding
      score and colon length shortening. Production of proinflammatory cytokines was
      decreased and that of the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 was increased in the
      DSS-treated mice given Lb. kefiranofaciens M1. The putative receptor for the
      protective effects of Lb. kefiranofaciens M1 was toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2),
      which was involved in probiotic-induced cytokine production in vitro and in
      attenuation of the bleeding score and colon length shortening in vivo. In this
      study, the kefir lactobacillus Lb. kefiranofaciens M1 clearly demonstrated an
      anticolitis effect. Based on these results, Lb. kefiranofaciens M1 has the
      potential to be applied in fermented dairy products as an alternative therapy for
      intestinal disorders.

TI  - Glucans from the edible mushroom Pleurotus pulmonarius inhibit colitis-associated
      colon carcinogenesis in mice.
PG  - 504-18
LID - 10.1007/s00535-011-0514-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We have recently demonstrated that polysaccharides from fruiting body
      extract (FBE) or mycelia extract (ME) of the edible mushroom Pleurotus
      pulmonarius exert antiproliferative effects in intestinal cells and an
      anti-inflammatory effect in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse model of acute
      colitis. The aim of this study was to assess the role of fungal FBE and ME in
      colon carcinogenesis. METHODS: In vitro, human colorectal cancer cells were
      treated with FBE and ME and analyzed for inflammation response, for markers of
      apoptosis, and for cell-cycle progression. In vivo, FBE and ME were tested in a
      mouse model of colitis-associated colorectal carcinogenesis induced by cyclic
      treatments with DSS and azoxymethane. Treated mice were fed a daily diet
      containing 2 or 20 mg FBE or ME per mouse for 80 days. RESULTS: In vitro, FBE and
      ME induced apoptosis in a dose-responsive manner and modulated the expression of 
      Bcl-2, Bax, and cytochrome c, and blocked tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF)-alpha-induced inhibitor of nuclear factor (NF) (Ikappa)-Balpha degradation 
      and NF-kappaB nuclear translocation. In vivo, dietary administration of FBE and
      ME significantly reduced the formation of aberrant crypt foci, which precedes
      colorectal cancer, and of microadenomas. The treatments significantly lowered the
      expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and increased the number of
      cells undergoing apoptosis in the colon. Additionally, FBE and ME inhibited the
      expression of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha in colonic tissue.
      CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that P. pulmonarius FBE and ME inhibit
      colitis-associated colon carcinogenesis induced in mice through the modulation of
      cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and inhibition of inflammation.

      rectal enema in children with active distal ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 327-34

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intestinal microbiota manipulation, one of the pathogenetic
      components of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), has become an attractive therapy 
      for ulcerative colitis (UC). AIM: To assess in children with active distal UC the
      effectiveness of Lactobacillus (L) reuteri ATCC 55730 enema on inflammation and
      cytokine expression of rectal mucosa. METHODS: A total of 40 patients (median
      age: 7.2 years range 6-18) with mild to moderate UC were enrolled in a
      prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled study. They received an enema
      solution containing 10(10) CFU of L. reuteri ATCC 55730 or placebo for 8 weeks,
      in addition to oral mesalazine. Clinical endoscopic and histological scores as
      well as rectal mucosal expression levels of IL-10, IL-1beta, TNFalpha and IL-8
      were evaluated at the beginning and at the end of the trial. RESULTS: Thirty-one 
      patients accomplished the trial (17 males, median age 13 year, range 7-18). Mayo 
      score (including clinical and endoscopic features) decreased significantly in the
      L. reuteri group (3.2 +/- 1.3 vs. 8.6 +/- 0.8, P < 0.01) compared with placebo
      (7.1 +/- 1.1 vs. 8.7 +/- 0.7, NS); furthermore, histological score significantly 
      decrease only in the L. reuteri group (0.6 +/- 0.5 vs. 4.5 +/- 0.6, P < 0.01)
      (placebo: 2.9 +/- 0.8 vs. 4.6 +/- 0.6, NS). At the post-trial evaluation of
      cytokine mucosal expression levels, IL-10 significantly increased (P < 0.01)
      whereas IL-1beta, TNFalpha and IL-8 significantly decreased (P < 0.01) only in
      the L. reuteri group. CONCLUSIONS: In children with active distal ulcerative
      colitis, rectal infusion of L. reuteri is effective in improving mucosal
      inflammation and changing mucosal expression levels of some cytokines involved in
      the mechanisms of inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - The potential for probiotic manipulation of the gastrointestinal microbiome.
PG  - 192-201
LID - 10.1016/j.copbio.2011.11.004 [doi]
AB  - Multiple internal and external sites of the healthy human body are colonized by a
      diversity of symbiotic microbes. The microbial assemblages found in the intestine
      represent some of the most dense and diverse of these human-associated
      ecosystems. Unsurprisingly, the enteric microbiome, that is the totality of
      microbes, their combined genomes, and their interactions with the human body, has
      a profound impact on physiological aspects of mammalian function, not least, host
      immune response. Lack of early-life exposure to certain microbes, or shifts in
      the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiome have been linked to the
      development and progression of several intestinal and extra-intestinal diseases, 
      including childhood asthma development and inflammatory bowel disease. Modulating
      microbial exposure through probiotic supplementation represents a long-held
      strategy towards ameliorating disease via intestinal microbial community
      restructuring. This field has experienced somewhat of a resurgence over the past 
      few years, primarily due to the exponential increase in human microbiome studies 
      and a growing appreciation of our dependence on resident microbiota to modulate
      human health. This review aims to review recent regulatory aspects related to
      probiotics in food. It also summarizes what is known to date with respect to
      human gastrointestinal microbiota - the niche which has been most extensively
      studied in the human system - and the evidence for probiotic supplementation as a
      viable therapeutic strategy for modulating this consortium.

TI  - Relevance of protein fermentation to gut health.
PG  - 184-96
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201100542 [doi]
AB  - It is generally accepted that carbohydrate fermentation results in beneficial
      effects for the host because of the generation of short chain fatty acids,
      whereas protein fermentation is considered detrimental for the host's health.
      Protein fermentation mainly occurs in the distal colon, when carbohydrates get
      depleted and results in the production of potentially toxic metabolites such as
      ammonia, amines, phenols and sulfides. However, the effectivity of these
      metabolites has been established mainly in in vitro studies. In addition, some
      important bowel diseases such as colorectal cancer (CRC) and ulcerative colitis
      appear most often in the distal colon, which is the primary site of protein
      fermentation. Finally, epidemiological studies revealed that diets rich in meat
      are associated with the prevalence of CRC, as is the case in Western society.
      Importantly, meat intake not only increases fermentation of proteins but also
      induces increased intake of fat, heme and heterocyclic amines, which may also
      play a role in the development of CRC. Despite these indications, the
      relationship between gut health and protein fermentation has not been thoroughly 
      investigated. In this review, the existing evidence about the potential toxicity 
      of protein fermentation from in vitro animal and human studies will be
      summarized.

TI  - VSL#3 probiotics regulate the intestinal epithelial barrier in vivo and in vitro 
      via the p38 and ERK signaling pathways.
PG  - 202-8
LID - 10.3892/ijmm.2011.839 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics can play a role in enhancing intestinal barrier function. However, the
      underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. The aim of this study was to
      examine the effects of VSL#3 probiotics on colonic epithelium permeability, tight
      junction protein expression and MAPKs signaling pathways in vivo and in vitro. In
      vivo, acute colitis was induced by administration of 3.5% dextran sodium sulfate 
      for 7 days. Rats in two groups were treated with either 15 mg VSL#3 or placebo
      via a gastric tube once daily after induction of colitis. Tight junction protein 
      expression and the MAPKs signaling pathways were studied by immunohistochemistry 
      and immunoblotting. In vitro, HT-29 cells were exposed to TNF-alpha for up to 48 
      h with or without pre-treatment with a p38 MAPK inhibitor, an ERK inhibitor or a 
      JNK inhibitor. Then tight junction proteins and the phosphorylation of MAPKs were
      examined in the presence or absence of VSL#3. In vivo, VSL#3 probiotics
      significantly ameliorated the disease activity index from Day 4 onward. In acute 
      colitis rats, decreased expression of the tight junction proteins were observed, 
      whereas VSL#3 therapy prevented these changes and increased the expression of
      phosphorylated p38 (P-p38), and of phosphorylated ERK (P-ERK). In vitro, tight
      junction proteins, P-p38 and P-ERK in the VSL#3 group were significantly higher
      than in the control and TNF-alpha groups. The p38 MAPK inhibitor and the ERK
      inhibitor could effectively prevent this effect. VSL#3 probiotics protected the
      epithelial barrier and increased the tight junction protein expression in vivo
      and in vitro by activating the p38 and ERK signaling pathways.

LID - 10.1016/j.jnutbio.2011.05.012 [doi]
AB  - The common food additive kappa-carrageenan (kappa-CGN) is a sulfated
      polysaccharide that resembles chondroitin-4-sulfate (C4S) and dermatan sulfate
      (DS). All have a sulfate group on C4 of a glycoside (galactose for CGN and
      N-acetylgalactosamine for C4S), and the sulfate-bearing glycoside is linked in a 
      beta-1,4-configuration to an unsulfated, six-carbon sugar (galactose for CGN,
      glucuronate for C4S and iduronate for DS). The enzyme arylsulfatase B (ARSB;
      N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfate) is the highly selective enzyme that removes the 
      four-sulfate group from the nonreducing terminus of C4S and DS, thereby
      regulating subsequent degradation. In this report, kappa-CGN is shown to be a
      substrate for recombinant human ARSB (rhARSB). Sulfate was generated from both
      C4S and kappa-CGN following incubation with rhARSB. Exposure of human colonic
      epithelial cells to kappa-CGN, but not to C4S, produced reactive oxygen species
      (ROS) and increased interleukin (IL)-8 secretion. The ROS production from
      kappa-CGN was reduced by exposure to rhARSB, but increased by competition from
      C4S or DS, but not from chondroitin-6-sulfate. Prior treatment of either lambda- 
      or iota-CGN with rhARSB had no impact on ROS, IL-8 or inorganic sulfate
      production, demonstrating a specific effect of the molecular configuration of
      kappa-CGN. By mimicry of C4S and DS and by interaction with ARSB, kappa-CGN can
      directly interfere with the normal cellular functions of C4S, DS and ARSB. Since 
      C4S and DS are present in high concentration in tissues, the impact of kappa-CGN 
      exposure may be due to some extent to interference with the normal biological
      functions of ARSB, C4S and DS.

TI  - A rapid procedure for the detection and isolation of enterohaemorrhagic
      Escherichia coli (EHEC) serogroup O26, O103, O111, O118, O121, O145 and O157
      strains and the aggregative EHEC O104:H4 strain from ready-to-eat vegetables.
PG  - 19-30

AB  - Human infections with Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli strains (EHEC) as
      agents of Haemorrhagic Colitis (HC) and Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome (HUS) are
      frequently associated with the consumption of EHEC contaminated foodstuffs of
      different origins. EHEC O26, O103, O111, O118, O121, O145 and O157 strains are
      responsible for the majority of HC and HUS cases worldwide. In May 2011, the
      emerging aggregative EHEC O104:H4 strain caused a large outbreak with high HUS
      incidence in northern Germany. Contaminated sprouted seeds were suspected to be
      the vehicles of transmission. The examination of vegetables retailed for raw
      consumption revealed low numbers of E. coli (<100 cfu/g) together with high
      titres of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas (approx. 5.6 x 10(7) cfu/g).
      Specific methods of EHEC detection adapted to vegetables are not yet published.
      Therefore, we have developed a rapid and sensitive method for detecting low EHEC 
      contamination in vegetables (1-10 cfu/25 g) with artificially EHEC contaminated
      ready-to-eat salads. A 6-hour enrichment period in BRILA-broth was sufficient to 
      detect 1-10 EHEC from spiked samples after plating 0.1 ml portions of enrichment 
      culture on selective TBX-agar and CHROMagar STEC plates that were incubated at 44
      degrees C overnight. Unlike EHEC strains, the growth of bacteria of the plant
      flora was substantially inhibited at 44 degrees C. DNA for real-time PCR
      detection of EHEC characteristic genes (stx(1), stx(2), eae, ehxA, and O-antigen 
      associated) was prepared with bacteria grown on TBX-agar plates. The storage of
      EHEC inoculated salad samples for 72 h at 6 degrees C resulted in a significant
      reduction (mean value 14.6%) of detectable EHEC, suggesting interference of EHEC 
      with the resident plant microflora. CHROMagar STEC was evaluated as a selective
      medium for the detection of EHEC strains. Growth on CHROMagar STEC was closely
      associated with EHEC O26:[H11], O111:[H8], O118:H16, O121:[H19], O145:[H28],
      O157:[H7] and aggregative EHEC O104:H4 strains and with the presence of the terB 
      gene (tellurite resistance). TerB sequences were found in 87.2% of 235 EHEC but
      only in only 12.5% of 567 non-EHEC strains. EHEC strains which did not grow on
      CHROMagar STEC were negative for terB as frequently observed with EHEC O103:H2
      (52.9%) and sorbitol-fermenting O157:NM strains (100%). The enrichment and
      detection method was applied in the examination of sprouted seeds incriminated as
      vehicles in the EHEC O104:H4 outbreak in Germany. Aggregative EHEC O104:H4 could 
      be detected and isolated from a sample of sprouted seeds which was suspected as
      vector of transmission of EHEC O104 to humans.

TI  - Diet and risk of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 185-94
LID - 10.1016/j.dld.2011.10.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A better understanding of the environmental factors leading to
      inflammatory bowel disease should help to prevent occurrence of the disease and
      its relapses. AIM: To review current knowledge on dietary risk factors for
      inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: The PubMed, Medline and Cochrane Library
      were searched for studies on diet and risk of inflammatory bowel disease.
      RESULTS: Established non-diet risk factors include family predisposition,
      smoking, appendectomy, and antibiotics. Retrospective case-control studies are
      encumbered with methodological problems. Prospective studies on European cohorts,
      mainly including middle-aged adults, suggest that a diet high in protein from
      meat and fish is associated with a higher risk of inflammatory bowel disease.
      Intake of the n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid may confer risk of
      ulcerative colitis, whereas n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may be protective. No
      effect was found of intake of dietary fibres, sugar, macronutrients, total
      energy, vitamin C, D, E, Carotene, or Retinol (vitamin A) on risk of ulcerative
      colitis. No prospective data was found on risk related to intake of fruits,
      vegetables or food microparticles (titanium dioxide and aluminium silicate).
      CONCLUSIONS: A diet high in protein, particular animal protein, may be associated
      with increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease and relapses. N-6
      polyunsaturated fatty acids may predispose to ulcerative colitis whilst n-3
      polyunsaturated fatty acid may protect. These results should be confirmed in
      other countries and in younger subjects before dietary counselling is recommended
      in high risk subjects.

TI  - Loop-mediated isothermal amplification assays for detecting shiga toxin-producing
      Escherichia coli in ground beef and human stools.
PG  - 91-7
LID - 10.1128/JCM.05612-11 [doi]
AB  - Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), encompassing E. coli O157 and
      non-O157 STEC, is a significant cause of food-borne illnesses and deaths in the
      United States and worldwide. Shiga toxins (encoded by stx) and intimin (encoded
      by eae) are important virulence factors for STEC strains linked to severe human
      illnesses such as hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic-uremic syndrome. In this
      study, the stx(1), stx(2), and eae genes were chosen as targets to design
      loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays for the rapid, specific,
      sensitive, and quantitative detection of STEC strains. The assay performances in 
      pure culture and spiked ground beef and human stools were evaluated and compared 
      with those of quantitative PCR (qPCR). No false-positive or false-negative
      results were observed among 90 bacterial strains used to evaluate assay
      specificity. The limits of detection for seven STEC strains of various serogroups
      (O26, O45, O103, O111, O121, O145, and O157) were approximately 1 to 20
      CFU/reaction in pure culture and 10(3) to 10(4) CFU/g in spiked ground beef,
      which were comparable to the results of qPCR. Standard curves generated suggested
      good linear relationships between STEC cell numbers and LAMP turbidity signals.
      When applied in ground beef samples spiked with two low levels (1 to 2 and 10 to 
      20 CFU/25 g) of STEC cultures, the LAMP assays achieved accurate detection after 
      6 to 8 h enrichment. The assays also consistently detected STEC in human stool
      specimens spiked with 10(3) or 10(4) CFU/0.5 g stool after 4 h enrichment, while 
      qPCR required 4 to 6 h. In conclusion, the LAMP assays developed in this study
      may facilitate rapid and reliable identification of STEC contaminations in
      high-risk food commodities and also facilitate prompt diagnosis of STEC
      infections in clinical laboratories.

LID - 10.1016/j.tim.2011.09.004 [doi]
AB  - Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) mutants of lactobacilli suppress inflammation in animal
      models of experimental colitis. The fact that a single mutation of an
      administered Lactobacillus strain can result in enhanced probiotic efficacy is
      surprising given the genetic diversity and complexity of the intestinal niche,
      but at the same time exciting from a microbiological, immunological and
      gastroenterological point of view. In this Opinion article, we discuss the
      possible impacts of LTA modification in probiotic bacteria in the context of the 
      current knowledge regarding the proinflammatory capacity of LTA,
      structure-activity relationships of LTA, intestinal LTA recognition in healthy
      and colitis conditions and anti-inflammatory molecules of lactobacilli.

TI  - Functional analysis of colonic bacterial metabolism: relevant to health?
PG  - G1-9
LID - 10.1152/ajpgi.00048.2011 [doi]
AB  - With the use of molecular techniques, numerous studies have evaluated the
      composition of the intestinal microbiota in health and disease. However, it is of
      major interest to supplement this with a functional analysis of the microbiota.
      In this review, the different approaches that have been used to characterize
      microbial metabolites, yielding information on the functional end products of
      microbial metabolism, have been summarized. To analyze colonic microbial
      metabolites, the most conventional way is by application of a hypothesis-driven
      targeted approach, through quantification of selected metabolites from
      carbohydrate (e.g., short-chain fatty acids) and protein fermentation (e.g.,
      p-cresol, phenol, ammonia, or H(2)S), secondary bile acids, or colonic enzymes.
      The application of stable isotope-labeled substrates can provide an elegant
      solution to study these metabolic pathways in vivo. On the other hand, a top-down
      approach can be followed by applying metabolite fingerprinting techniques based
      on (1)H-NMR or mass spectrometric analysis. Quantification of known metabolites
      and characterization of metabolite patterns in urine, breath, plasma, and fecal
      samples can reveal new pathways and give insight into physiological regulatory
      processes of the colonic microbiota. In addition, specific metabolic profiles can
      function as a diagnostic tool for the identification of several gastrointestinal 
      diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Nevertheless, future
      research will have to evaluate the relevance of associations between metabolites 
      and different disease states.

TI  - PedsQL gastrointestinal symptoms module item development: qualitative methods.
PG  - 664-71
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e31823c9b88 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of the present qualitative study was to develop the
      items and support the content validity for the Pediatric Quality of Life
      Inventory (PedsQL) Gastrointestinal Symptoms Module for pediatric patients with
      functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders and organic GI diseases, hereafter
      referred to as GI disorders. METHODS: The iterative process included multiphase
      qualitative methods. A literature review of GI disorders was conducted to
      generate domains for the focus interviews. Six pediatric gastroenterologists with
      extensive clinical experience in GI disorders provided expert opinion regarding
      the conceptual framework. A total of 98 participants, 46 pediatric patients ages 
      5 to 18, and 52 parents of patients ages 2 to 18 with physician-diagnosed GI
      disorders (chronic constipation, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel
      syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease [Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis],
      gastroesophageal reflux disease), participated in the focus interviews and
      cognitive interviewing phases, including think-aloud and cognitive debriefing
      protocols. RESULTS: Eleven domains were derived from the qualitative methods
      involving patient and parent interviews and expert opinion, with content
      saturation achieved, resulting in 76 items. The 11 domains consisted of items
      measuring stomach pain, stomach upset, food and drink limits, trouble swallowing,
      heartburn and reflux, gas and bloating, constipation, diarrhea, worry, medicines,
      and communication. CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative methods involving pediatric patients 
      and their parents in the item generation process support the content validity for
      the new PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms Module. The PedsQL Gastrointestinal
      Symptoms Module is undergoing national multisite field testing as the next
      iterative phase.

TI  - Induction of dsRNA-activated protein kinase links mitochondrial unfolded protein 
      response to the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation.
PG  - 1269-1278
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2011-300767 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) feature multiple cellular stress
      responses, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) unfolded protein responses
      (UPRs). UPRs represent autoregulatory pathways that adjust organelle capacity to 
      cellular demand. A similar mechanism, mitochondrial UPR (mtUPR), has been
      described for mitochondria. ER UPR in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs)
      contributes to the development of intestinal inflammation, and since
      mitochondrial alterations and dysfunction are implicated in the pathogenesis of
      IBDs, the authors characterised mtUPR in the context of intestinal inflammation. 
      METHODS: Truncated ornithine transcarbamylase was used to selectively induce
      mtUPR in a murine IEC line. Dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) was administered to PKR
      (double-stranded-RNA-activated protein kinase) knockout mice to induce IEC stress
      in vivo and to test for their susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis. Expression
      levels of the mitochondrial chaperone chaperonin 60 (CPN60) and PKR were
      quantified in IECs from patients with IBDs and from murine models of colitis
      using immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Selective mtUPR
      induction by truncated ornithine transcarbamylase transfection triggered the
      phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 2alpha and cJun
      through the recruitment of PKR. Using pharmacological inhibitors and small
      inhibitory RNA, the authors identified mtUPR-induced eIF2alpha phosphorylation
      and transcription factor activation (cJun/AP1) as being dependent on the
      activities of the mitochondrial protease ClpP and the cytoplasmic kinase PKR.
      Pkr(-/-) mice failed to induce CPN60 in IECs upon DSS treatment at early time
      points and subsequently showed an almost complete resistance to DSS-induced
      colitis. Under inflammatory conditions, primary IECs from patients with IBDs and 
      two murine models of colitis exhibited a strong induction of the mtUPR marker
      protein CPN60 associated with enhanced expression of PKR. CONCLUSION: PKR
      integrates mtUPR into the disease-relevant ER UPR via eIF2alpha phosphorylation
      and AP1 activation. Induction of mtUPR and PKR was observed in IECs from murine
      models and patients with IBDs. The authors' results indicate that PKR might link 
      mitochondrial stress to intestinal inflammation.

TI  - Impaired butyrate oxidation in ulcerative colitis is due to decreased butyrate
      uptake and a defect in the oxidation pathway.
PG  - 1127-36
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21894 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In ulcerative colitis (UC) butyrate metabolism is impaired due to a
      defect in the butyrate oxidation pathway and/or transport. In the present study
      we correlated butyrate uptake and oxidation to the gene expression of the
      butyrate transporter SLC16A1 and the enzymes involved in butyrate oxidation
      (ACSM3, ACADS, ECHS1, HSD17B10, and ACAT2) in UC and controls. METHODS: Colonic
      mucosal biopsies were collected during endoscopy of 88 UC patients and 20
      controls with normal colonoscopy. Butyrate uptake and oxidation was measured by
      incubating biopsies with (14) C-labeled Na-butyrate. To assess gene expression,
      total RNA from biopsies was used for quantitative reverse-transcription
      polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In 20 UC patients, gene expression was
      reassessed after treatment with infliximab. RESULTS: Butyrate uptake and
      oxidation were significantly decreased in UC versus controls (P < 0.001 for
      both). Butyrate oxidation remained significantly reduced in UC after correction
      for butyrate uptake (P < 0.001), suggesting that the butyrate oxidation pathway
      itself is also affected. Also, the mucosal gene expression of SLC16A1, ACSM3,
      ACADS, ECHS1, HSD17B10, and ACAT2 was significantly decreased in UC as compared
      with controls (P < 0.001 for all). In a subgroup of patients (n = 20), the gene
      expression was reassessed after infliximab therapy. In responders to therapy, a
      significant increase in gene expression was observed. Nevertheless, only ACSM3
      mRNA levels returned to control values after therapy in the responders groups.
      CONCLUSIONS: The deficiency in the colonic butyrate metabolism in UC is initiated
      at the gene expression level and is the result of a decreased expression of
      SLC16A1 and enzymes in the beta-oxidation pathway of butyrate.

TI  - Pathogenesis of Shiga-toxin producing escherichia coli.
PG  - 67-103
LID - 10.1007/82_2011_176 [doi]
AB  - Shiga toxin (Stx)-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) are food-borne pathogens that
      cause hemorrhagic colitis and a serious sequela, the hemolytic uremic syndrome
      (HUS). The largest outbreaks of STEC are due to a single E. coli serotype,
      O157:H7, although non-O157 serotypes also cause the same diseases. Two
      immunologically distinct Stxs are found in E. coli, Stx1 and Stx2. The Stxs are
      AB(5) toxins that halt protein synthesis in the host cell, a process that may
      lead to an apoptotic cell death. Stx-mediated damage to renal glomerular
      endothelial cells is hypothesized as the precipitating event for HUS. A subset of
      STEC referred to as the enterohemorrhagic E. coli has the capacity to intimately 
      attach to and efface intestinal epithelial cells, a pathology called the A/E
      lesion. The A/E lesion is mediated by the adhesin intimin, its bacterially
      encoded receptor, Tir, and effectors secreted through a type III secretion
      system. The proteins needed for the A/E lesion are encoded within a large
      pathogenicity island called the locus of enterocyte effacement or LEE. There are 
      several animal models for STEC infection, but no one model fully represents the
      spectrum of STEC illness. Currently there is no cure for STEC infection, and
      therapies are based mainly on alleviating symptoms. However, chimeric or
      humanized monoclonal antibodies have been developed that neutralize the Stxs, and
      those therapies may be able to prevent the development of HUS in an STEC-infected
      patient.

TI  - How patients view probiotics: findings from a multicenter study of patients with 
      inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 138-44
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0b013e318225f545 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) have access to a growing number of probiotic products marketed to 
      improve digestive health. It is unclear how patients make decisions about
      probiotics and what role they expect their gastroenterologists to play as they
      consider using probiotics. Understanding patients' knowledge, attitudes and
      expectations of probiotics may help gastroenterologists engage patients in
      collaborative discussions about probiotics. STUDY: Focus groups were conducted
      with patients with IBD and IBS at the Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic, and Johns
      Hopkins University. Inductive analytic methods were used to identify common
      themes and draw interpretations from focus group narratives. RESULTS: One hundred
      thirty-six patients participated in 22 focus groups between March and August
      2009. Patients viewed probiotics as an appealing alternative to pharmaceutical
      drugs and understood probiotics as a more "natural," low-risk therapeutic option.
      Many patients were hesitant to use them without consulting their
      gastroenterologists. Patients would weigh the risks and benefits of probiotics,
      their disease severity and satisfaction with current treatments when considering 
      probiotic use. CONCLUSIONS: Patients are interested in probiotics but have many
      unanswered questions about their use. Our findings suggest that patients with IBD
      and IBS will look to gastroenterologists and other clinicians as trustworthy
      advisors regarding the utility of probiotics as an alternative or supplement to
      pharmaceutical drugs. Gastroenterologists and other clinicians who care for
      patients with these diseases should be prepared to discuss the potential benefits
      and risks of probiotics and assist patients in making informed decisions about
      their use.

TI  - Bovine lactoferrin induces interleukin-11 production in a hepatitis mouse model
      and human intestinal myofibroblasts.
PG  - 343-51
LID - 10.1007/s00394-011-0219-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Orally administered bovine lactoferrin (bLF) exerts an anti-inflammatory
      effect on hepatitis and colitis animal models. To investigate the mechanism
      underlying the action of bLF, we explored the expression of inflammation-related 
      factors in the intestine of a hepatitis mouse model after the oral administration
      of bLF and in several human intestinal cell lines treated with bLF. METHODS: The 
      effects of bLF on the expression of interleukin-11 (IL-11) and bone morphogenetic
      protein 2 (BMP2) in the intestinal mucosa of a hepatitis mouse model as well as
      in cell cultures of human intestinal epithelial cells, myofibroblasts, and
      monocytes were examined using the real-time reverse transcription polymerase
      chain reaction. Epithelial cells and myofibroblasts were also cocultured using
      transwells. bLF transport, and IL-11 and BMP2 induction, as well as the
      interactions between the two cell types, were then analyzed after bLF treatment. 
      RESULTS: In vivo, oral bLF administration increased the production of IL-11 and
      BMP2 in intestinal specimens. In vitro, bLF only stimulated the production of
      IL-11 in human intestinal myofibroblasts; i.e., it had no effect on BMP2
      production in any cell type. In the transwell cocultures, bLF passed through the 
      epithelium and directly stimulated IL-11 production in the myofibroblasts on the 
      basolateral side. The IL-11 produced in the myofibroblasts subsequently acted
      protectively on the epithelial cells of the coculture. CONCLUSIONS: bLF
      upregulated the activity of anti-inflammatory factors, such as IL-11, in the
      intestine of a hepatitis mouse model and human intestinal myofibroblasts.

TI  - The immunomodulatory properties of viable Lactobacillus salivarius ssp.
      salivarius CECT5713 are not restricted to the large intestine.
PG  - 365-74
LID - 10.1007/s00394-011-0221-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to better characterise the biological effects 
      of Lactobacillus salivarius ssp. salivarius CECT5713, a probiotic with
      immunomodulatory properties. METHODS: Live or dead probiotic was assayed in the
      TNBS model of rat colitis to determine whether viability was a requisite to exert
      the beneficial effects. In vitro studies were also performed in Caco-2 cells to
      evaluate its effects on epithelial cell recovery and IL-8 production. Finally,
      the probiotic was assayed in the LPS model of septic shock in mice to establish
      its effects when there is an altered systemic immune response. RESULTS: The
      viability of the probiotic was required for its anti-inflammatory activity. The
      probiotic inhibited IL-8 production in stimulated Caco-2 cells and facilitated
      the recovery of damaged intestinal epithelium. In LPS-treated mice, the probiotic
      inhibited the production of TNFalpha in plasma and lungs and increased the
      hepatic glutathione content. These effects were associated with an improvement in
      the altered production of the T-cell cytokines in splenocytes, by reducing IL-2
      and IL-5 and by increasing IL-10. Finally, it reduced the increased plasma IgG
      production in LPS-treated mice. CONCLUSION: The anti-inflammatory effects of
      viable L. salivarius ssp. salivarius CECT5713 are not restricted to the
      gastrointestinal tract.

TI  - Fecal bacteriotherapy for ulcerative colitis: patients are ready, are we?
PG  - 676-84
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21775 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fecal bacteriotherapy (FB) has been proposed as a safe and effective 
      alternative treatment for a number of gastrointestinal conditions including
      ulcerative colitis (UC). We performed a qualitative study to explore the
      attitudes and concerns of adult patients and parents of children with UC
      regarding FB as a potential treatment. METHODS: We conducted six focus groups for
      adult patients with UC and parents of children with UC or indeterminate colitis. 
      Participants were asked about their perceptions of and interest in FB as a
      treatment for UC. Sessions were recorded, transcribed, and reviewed to identify
      domains, themes, and major concepts. RESULTS: The focus groups included 15 adult 
      patients and seven parents of children with colitis. We identified five major
      domains pertaining to FB: impressions of treatment, benefits, risks, potential
      mechanisms, and social concerns. All but one participant expressed interest in FB
      and several wished it were already available. Participants compared FB to
      probiotics, felt it was "natural," easier than current therapies, and with donor 
      screening would be safe. Although initial distaste and the "yuck factor" were
      uniformly mentioned, these concerns were outweighed by perceived benefits.
      CONCLUSION: This is the first study to examine important ethical and social
      issues surrounding FB as a treatment for UC. Given adequate supporting research, 
      donor selection, and screening, adult patients and parents of children with UC
      will consider FB and are eager for it to become available. These findings have
      important implications for future microbiome-based treatments.

      disease: a one-year prospective follow-up study.
PG  - 718-24
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21785 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to longitudinally study serum homocysteine 
      levels in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) in
      relation to disease activity and B vitamin status. METHODS: In all, 98
      consecutive adult patients (age 25-55 years) with CD (n = 70) and UC (n = 28)
      were enrolled and assessed at three timepoints over 1 year. RESULTS: There were
      no significant differences in levels of homocysteine, B vitamins, or dietary
      intake by disease type, disease activity, or across visits. 13% of all
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients had elevated homocysteine at least once
      during the study. Nine patients with CD had fluctuating homocysteine levels
      during the study but these were inconsistent, ranging from within normal range to
      elevated levels in any individual. Six of these nine patients were persistently
      in remission. 30% of all IBD patients had vitamin B6 deficiency, 11% had vitamin 
      B12 deficiency, and one patient (CD) had folate deficiency. All vitamins showed a
      significant correlation between intake and serum levels (B6; r = 0.46, P < 0.001,
      B12; r = 0.42, P < 0.001, and folate; r = 0.26, P = 0.008). There was an inverse 
      relationship between serum homocysteine in the blood and serum vitamin B12 (r =
      -0.241, P = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Serum homocysteine was mostly normal in patients
      with IBD and changed minimally over time. There was no association between
      disease activity and elevation of serum homocysteine. 30% of patients have
      vitamin B6 deficiency but vitamin B6 is not associated with elevated
      homocysteine. The routine measurement of homocysteine is not warranted.

TI  - Prevalence and management of anemia in children, adolescents, and adults with
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 513-9
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21740 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are
      more likely to have Crohn's disease (CD) than ulcerative colitis (UC) and their
      disease tends to be more extensive and severe than in adults. We hypothesized
      that the prevalence of anemia would therefore be greater in children and
      adolescents than in adults attending IBD outpatient clinics. METHODS: Using the
      WHO age-adjusted definitions of anemia we assessed the prevalence, severity,
      type, and response to treatment of anemia in patients attending pediatric,
      adolescent, and adult IBD clinics at our hospital. RESULTS: The prevalence of
      anemia was 70% (41/59) in children, 42% (24/54) in adolescents, and 40% (49/124) 
      in adults (P < 0.01). Overall, children (88% [36/41]) and adolescents (83%
      [20/24]) were more often iron-deficient than adults (55% [27/49]) (P < 0.01).
      Multivariate logistic regression showed that both active disease (odds ratio
      [OR], 4.7 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5, 8.8) and attending the pediatric
      clinic (OR 3.7; 95% CI, 1.6, 8.4) but not the adolescent clinic predicted iron
      deficiency anemia. Fewer iron-deficient children (13% [5/36]) than adolescents
      (30% [6/20]) or adults (48% [13/27]) had been given oral iron (P < 0.05); none
      had received intravenous iron compared with 30% (6/20) adolescents and 41%
      (11/27) adults (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Anemia is even more common in children 
      than in older IBD patients. Oral iron was given to half of adolescents and adults
      but, despite similar tolerance and efficacy, only a quarter of children with
      iron-deficient anemia. Reasons for the apparent underutilization of iron therapy 
      include a perceived lack of benefit and concerns about side effects, including
      worsening of IBD activity.

TI  - Modified apple polysaccharide prevents against tumorigenesis in a mouse model of 
      colitis-associated colon cancer: role of galectin-3 and apoptosis in cancer
      prevention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common and preventable
      cancers. Regular consumption of apples is conducive to reduction in CRC risk. AIM
      OF THE STUDY: To evaluate effects of modified apple polysaccharide (MAP) on
      tumorigenesis in a mouse model of colitis-associated colon cancer. METHODS: One
      hundred male ICR mice were administered with 1, 2-dimethyl-hydrazine (DMH) and
      dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Forty mice were given no further treatment, the
      rest were fed basal diet blended with three different doses of MAP; 2.5, 5, and
      10% (20 mice in each group). RESULTS: MAP significantly protected ICR mice
      against DMH/DSS-induced tumorigenesis. The incidence of tumor development was 90%
      (18/20) in the mice treated with DMH/DSS, but that was reduced to 25% (5/20), 15%
      (3/20), and 5% (1/20), respectively, in the mice treated with basal diets plus
      2.5, 5, and 10% of MAP. Study of apoptosis of colonic epithelial cells revealed
      that MAP moderately increased apoptosis, suggesting that the anti-tumor potency
      of MAP was probably attributed to its ability to induce apoptosis. Western blot
      analysis demonstrated that carbohydrate-binding protein galectin-3 changed in
      both the nucleus and the cytoplasm during the process from colitis to colon
      cancer in the model. And MAP could inhibit the binding of galectin-3 to its
      ligand: this is, at least in part, the possible mechanism of MAP by enhancing
      apoptosis and preventing tumorigenesis. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that MAP 
      has a potential role in clinical prevention and treatment for colon cancer.
