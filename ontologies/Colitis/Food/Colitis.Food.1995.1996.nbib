TI  - Failure of added dietary gluten to induce small intestinal histopathological
      changes in patients with watery diarrhea and lymphocytic colitis.
PG  - 436-9
AB  - Lymphocytic colitis is a form of microscopic colitis usually characterized by
      watery diarrhea and often associated with biopsy-defined celiac disease. Two
      patients with lymphocytic colitis and normal small intestinal biopsies who were
      administered 40 g of added dietary gluten for four consecutive weeks are
      presented. Small intestinal biopsies from multiple sites in the proximal small
      bowel were done after three and four weeks to determine whether pathological
      changes in latent celiac disease could be induced in these patients with a high
      gluten-containing diet. In addition, colorectal biopsies were done to determine
      whether the colitis was sensitive to oral gluten. No alterations in the small
      intestinal biopsies were detected in either patient and no changes occurred in
      colitis severity. Although microscopic forms of colitis have been linked to
      celiac disease, this study indicates that lymphocytic colitis is a heterogeneous 
      clinicopathological disorder that, in some patients, is independent of any
      gluten-induced intestinal pathological changes.

TI  - Culturing enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli in the presence and absence of
      glucose as a simple means of evaluating the acid tolerance of stationary-phase
      cells.
PG  - 4009-13
AB  - Prior growth of seven enterohemorrhagic and one nonenterohemorrhagic strains of
      Escherichia coli in tryptic soy broth with (TSB+G) and without (TSB-G) 1% glucose
      was evaluated for its effect on acid tolerance. The final pHs of 18-h TSB+G and
      TSB-G cultures were 4.6 to 5.2 and 6.9 to 7.0, respectively. Cells were then
      transferred to brain heart infusion broth adjusted to pH 2.5 or 3.0 with HCl,
      incubated at 37 degrees C for up to 7 h, and assayed periodically for viable
      populations with brain heart infusion and MacConkey agars. All enterohemorrhagic 
      strains were acid resistant (< 0.5 log decline after 7 h) when initially cultured
      in TSB+G, but substantial differences in acid tolerance were observed among
      strains cultured in TSB-G (log declines ranged from < 0.3 to > 3.8). The results 
      indicated that prior growth in a medium with and without a fermentable
      carbohydrate is a convenient way to studying the induction of acid tolerance,
      that acid inactivation is preceded by a period of acid injury, and that
      pH-independent and pH-dependent stationary-phase acid tolerance phenotypes may
      exist among strains of enterohemorrhagic E. coli.

PG  - 491-5
AB  - Ten infants with colitis due to milk protein allergy, presenting as hematochezia,
      whose symptoms did not resolve with the use of hydrolyzed cow-milk-based
      formulas, were treated with a modular lamb-meat-based formula (LOP). The patients
      were followed up for 3 months to 5 years. Prompt resolution of symptoms was
      achieved. In three patients, increased levels of creatinine and blood urea
      nitrogen and mild metabolic acidosis were noted, all returning to normal after
      the protein intake was lowered. All patients had normal growth. Seven patients
      were able to tolerate cow milk protein or soy at age 9-15 months. The LOP formula
      is well tolerated and is a safe alternative formula for infants allergic to cow
      milk hydrolysate formula.

TI  - Increased oxidative stress and decreased antioxidant defenses in mucosa of
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 2078-86
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by chronic intestinal
      inflammation whose cellular components are capable of oxidative respiratory
      bursts that may result in tissue injury. Mucosal biopsies were analyzed for
      protein carbonyl content (POPs), DNA oxidation products
      [8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG)], reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs),
      trace metals (copper, zinc, and iron) and superoxide dismutase (Cu-Zn SOD). In
      Crohn's disease biopsies, there was an increase in ROIs, POPs, 8-OHdG, and iron, 
      while decreased copper and Cu-Zn SOD activity were found in inflamed tissues
      compared to controls. For ulcerative colitis, there was an increase in ROIs,
      POPs, and iron in inflamed tissue compared to controls, while decreased zinc and 
      copper were observed. An imbalance in the formation of reactive oxygen species
      and antioxidant micronutrients may be important in the pathogenesis and/or
      perpetuation of the tissue injury in IBD and may provide a rationale for
      therapeutic modulation with antioxidants.

TI  - Polymerase chain reaction for detecting Escherichia coli O157: H7.
PG  - 103-13
AB  - Escherichia coli O157:H7 is known as an important cause of hemorrhagic colitis
      and hemolytic uremic syndrome. Real-time procedures that are sensitive for
      detecting small populations of this bacterium in food are lacking and needed. An 
      expression library was constructed by ligation of BamHI-EcoRI DNA fragments of E.
      coli O157:H7 to plasmid vector pUC19 and transformation of recombinant plasmids
      to E. coli JM109. A clone that contained a specific DNA fragment of E. coli
      O157:H7 was identified by colony immunoblot assay using monoclonal antibody MAb
      4E8C12 that uniquely links to E. coli O157:H7 and a few other serotypes of
      verotoxin-producing E. coli. The DNA sequence of the clone consisted of 110 bp of
      5' region of enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) eae gene and a 688 bp DNA fragment 
      adjacent to 5' end of the eae gene, including an unknown function gene encoding
      156 amino acids. A pair of oligonucleotide primers was synthesized based on the
      sequence of the 688 bp fragment. The primers were used in a polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) to amplify a target DNA of 633 bp. The primers amplified 1 ng of
      DNA from 67 strains of E. coli O157:H7, two strains of E. coli O157:NM, and 7 of 
      11 E. coli O55:H7 and O55:NM strains, but not 50 ng of DNA from 34 strains of 29 
      other E. coli serotypes and 25 strains of 8 other bacterial species. Annealing
      temperatures from 60 to 63 degrees C could be used for the PCR without loss of
      specificity. The minimum amount of target DNA detected by the PCR was 5 pg. When 
      a boiling method and GeneReleaser were used, the PCR was able to detect as few as
      25 and 38 CFU of E. coli O157:H7, respectively, in 3 h.

PG  - 205-9
AB  - For many microorganisms, including Clostridium difficile, mucosal association is 
      an important factor influencing intestinal colonisation and subsequent infection.
      Inhibition of adhesion of C. difficile to intestinal mucosa could be a new
      promising strategy for prevention and treatment of antibiotic-associated
      diarrhoea. We investigated the possibilities of influencing the adhesion of C.
      difficile by xylitol and bovine colostrum whey. Caco-2 cells and C. difficile
      cells were incubated with 1%, 5% and 10% solutions of xylitol and colostrum. Our 
      study revealed that both xylitol and colostrum inhibited the adhesion of C.
      difficile to Caco-2 cells. Inhibition by xylitol was dose-dependent. When
      compared to the control, the count of adherent C. difficile decreased 3.4 times
      when treated with 1% xylitol, 12 times when 5% xylitol was applied, and 18.7
      times when treated with 10% xylitol. The inhibition of adherence by colostrum was
      partially dose-dependent: 3.1 times in the case of 1%, and 5.5 times in the cases
      of 5% and 10% colostrum. Further experimental and clinical studies are needed for
      the application of xylitol and colostrum in the treatment and prophylaxis of
      pseudomembraneous colitis.

TI  - Molecular microbiological investigation of an outbreak of hemolytic-uremic
      syndrome caused by dry fermented sausage contaminated with Shiga-like
      toxin-producing Escherichia coli.
PG  - 1622-7
AB  - Shiga-like toxin-producing Escherichia coli (SLTEC) strains are a diverse group
      of organisms which are known to cause diarrhea and hemorrhagic colitis in humans.
      This can lead to potentially fatal systemic sequelae, such as hemolytic-uremic
      syndrome (HUS). Strains belonging to more than 100 different O:H serotypes have
      been associated with severe SLTEC disease in humans, of which only O157 strains
      (which are uncommon in Australia) have a distinguishable cultural characteristic 
      (sorbitol negative). During an outbreak of HUS in Adelaide, South Australia, a
      sensitive PCR assay specific for Shiga-like toxin genes (slt) was used to test
      cultures of feces and suspected foods. This enabled rapid confirmation of
      infection and identified a locally produced dry fermented sausage (mettwurst) as 
      the source of infection. Cultures of feces from 19 of 21 HUS patients and 7 of 8 
      mettwurst samples collected from their homes were PCR positive for slt-I and
      slt-II genes. SLTEC isolates belonging to serotype O111:H- was subsequently
      isolated from 16 patients and 4 mettwurst samples. Subsequent restriction
      fragment length polymorphism analysis of chromosomal DNA from these isolates with
      slt-specific probes indicated that at least three different O111:H- genotypes
      were associated with the outbreak. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of genomic
      DNA restricted with XbaI showed that two of these restriction fragment length
      polymorphism types were closely related, but the third was quite distinct.
      However, SLTEC strains of other serotypes, including O157:H-, were also isolated 
      from some of the HUS patients.

TI  - Trophic factors for the gastrointestinal tract.
PG  - 265-85
AB  - GI trophic factors that influence the coordinated pre- and postnatal growth and
      development of the GI tract have been identified. Studies in animals and humans
      demonstrate that GI trophic factors can initiate cellular growth and expression
      of differentiated function, and they are important in adaptation and repair
      following injury. Systemically as well as enterally administered growth factors
      can stimulate GI growth and maturation, suggesting that trophic factors in the
      serum of neonates may modulate GI growth via receptors on the serosal membranes
      of enterocytes. GI trophic factors may be synthesized endogenously or provided
      postnatally in milk. GI trophic factors in human milk play an important role in
      regulating the adaptive functional changes that accompany the transition to
      postnatal enteral feedings. Although human milk growth factors do not appear to
      be essential for infant survival, the elevated risk of gastrointestinal-related
      illnesses in formula-fed as compared with breast-fed infants (diarrhea,
      necrotizing enterocolitis, colitis, Crohn's disease) suggest that bioactive
      compounds in human milk contribute to the apparent protective effect of breast
      feeding. GI trophic factors have the potential to be used therapeutically to
      enhance GI maturation and repair following injury. These applications may be
      particularly useful in the premature or postsurgical infant. Several issues
      require further research, including (1) the mechanism of action, (2) the efficacy
      of oral versus systemic administration, (3) characterization of the complex
      interactions between the various growth factors, because some appear to act
      synergistically, (4) the effect of exogenously administered growth factors on
      endogenous production of that factor, its receptor, or other growth factors, (5) 
      the effect of growth factors upon tissues not directly associated with the GI
      tract, and (6) the determination of safe and effective upper limits.

TI  - Characterisation of inorganic microparticles in pigment cells of human gut
      associated lymphoid tissue.
PG  - 390-5
AB  - Macrophages at the base of human gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), become
      loaded early in life with dark granular pigment that is rich in aluminium,
      silicon, and titanium. The molecular characteristics, intracellular distribution,
      and source of this pigment is described. Laser scanning and electron microscopy
      showed that pigmented macrophages were often closely related to collagen fibres
      and plasma cells in GALT of both small and large intestine and contained numerous
      phagolysosomes, previously described as granules, that are rich in electron dense
      submicron sized particles. Morphological assessment, x ray microanalysis, and
      image electron energy loss spectroscopy showed three distinct types of
      microparticle: type I - spheres of titanium dioxide, 100-200 nm diameter,
      characterised as the synthetic food-additive polymorph anatase; type II -
      aluminosilicates, < 100-400 nm in length, generally of flaky appearance, often
      with adsorbed surface iron, and mostly characteristic of the natural clay mineral
      kaolinite; and type III - mixed environmental silicates without aluminium,
      100-700 nm in length and of variable morphology. Thus, this cellular pigment that
      is partly derived from food additives and partly from the environment is composed
      of inert inorganic microparticles and loaded into phagolysosomes of macrophages
      within the GALT of all human subjects. These observations suggest that the
      pathogenicity of this pigment should be further investigated since, in
      susceptible individuals, the same intracellular distribution of these three types
      of submicron particle causes chronic latent granulomatous inflammation.

PG  - R26-33
AB  - We have reviewed all general outbreaks of infection due to Vero cytotoxin
      producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) O157 reported in England and Wales from 1992 to
      1994. One hundred and seventy-three people were affected in 18 outbreaks,
      compared with 76 people in seven outbreaks in the preceding three years (1989 to 
      1991). Outbreaks occurred throughout England and Wales. Thirty-eight per cent of 
      cases were admitted to hospital, 21% developed haemolytic uraemic syndrome, and
      3% died. VTEC O157 infection causes particular concern because of its serious
      complications--haemorrhagic colitis and haemolytic uraemic syndrome, its capacity
      to spread from person to person as well as by food and water, and its reservoir
      in dairy and beef cattle.

TI  - Meat grinders and molecular epidemiology: two supermarket outbreaks of
      Escherichia coli O157:H7 infection.
PG  - 480-3
AB  - Between 23 June and 15 July 1994, 21 cases (19 primary and 2 secondary) of
      Escherichia coli O157:H7 infection were identified in the Bethel, Connecticut,
      area. Three pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns from 15 isolates (I,
      n = 13; II, n = 2; and III, n = 1) were observed. A case-control study that
      excluded secondary cases and patients with PFGE II and III patterns (n = 16)
      demonstrated that consumption of food from one supermarket was associated with
      illness (15/16 cases vs. 31/47 geographically matched controls, odds ratio [OR]
      undefined, lower 95% confidence interval OR = 1.45, P = .018). No one food was
      associated with illness. Inspection of the supermarket revealed deficiencies in
      hygiene and meat handling practices. The 2 cases with PFGE II ate raw beef and
      raw lamb from a second supermarket. These outbreaks demonstrate the value of PFGE
      in supporting epidemiologic investigations and the potential for outbreaks
      arising from retail outlets.

AB  - Infections with verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli and (VTEC), and
      especially with serotype O157, are the main cause of haemolytic-uraemic syndrome 
      (HUS) in children in the Netherlands. 8% of the patients infected develop HUS;
      the incidence is 2/105/year in children under 5 years. The infection may be
      asymptomatic, but may also lead to mild to haemorrhagic diarrhoea and to
      haemorrhagic colitis. Up to 10% of the patients die in the acute phase of the
      disease and in up to another 10% the renal damage does not resolve completely. In
      1993 bovine meat samples examined by polymerase chain reaction revealed VTEC in
      16% of the cases; however none of the isolated serotypes was known to be
      pathogenic in humans. Epidemiological investigations are being carried out in the
      cattle population. Verocytotoxins are exotoxins that bind to surface receptors on
      cells after which part of the toxin is internalized where it inhibits protein
      synthesis. The functional receptor is glycosphingolipid globotriaosylceramide, a 
      molecule normally only expressed in the renal glomeruli of children under three
      years of age.

TI  - [Infectious diarrhea in the aged].
PG  - 184-8
AB  - Infectious diarrhoea in the elderly is associated with high morbidity and
      mortality and need early diagnosis and treatment. Polypathology, malnutrition,
      polytherapy, length of stay in the hospital and residence in nursing-home
      contribute to the increasing incidence and gravity of these diseases with aging. 
      Viral gastroenteritis is responsible for epidemic in nursing-home residents.
      Bacterial gastrointestinal infections are primarily caused by enterotoxigenic
      agents inducing sporadic or epidemic infections food poisoning. Older adults are 
      more particularly exposed to antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Clostridium
      difficle has been increasingly recognized as a cause of pseudomembranous colitis 
      in elderly and is associated with increased mortality. The approach to an old
      patient with suspected infectious diarrhoea should be to eliminate the likely
      noninfectious causes, to detect immediate complications due to hydroelectrolytic 
      loss, to initiate early appropriated oral rehydration therapy so as to prevent
      dehydratation, to avoid the use of antimotility drugs, and to evaluate and to
      take over nutritional consequences of diarrhoea.

TI  - Nutrition and gastrointestinal disease.
PG  - 52-9
AB  - Nutrition and intestinal function are intimately interrelated. The chief purpose 
      of the gut is to digest and absorb nutrients in order to maintain life.
      Consequently, chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disease commonly results in
      malnutrition and increased morbidity and mortality. For example, studies have
      shown that 50-70% of adult patients with Crohn's disease were weight-depleted and
      75% of adolescents growth-retarded. On the other hand, chronic malnutrition
      impairs digestive and absorptive function because food and nutrients are not only
      the major trophic factors to the gut but also provide the building blocks for
      digestive enzymes and absorptive cells. For example, recent studies of ours have 
      shown that a weight loss of greater than 30% accompanying a variety of diseases
      was associated with a reduction in pancreatic enzyme secretion of over 80%,
      villus atrophy and impaired carbohydrate and fat absorption. Finally, specific
      nutrients can induce disease, for example, gluten-sensitive enteropathy, whilst
      dietary factors such as fibre, resistant starch, short-chain fatty acids,
      glutamine and fish-oils may prevent gastrointestinal diseases such as
      diverticulitis, diversion colitis, ulcerative colitis, colonic adenomatosis and
      colonic carcinoma. The role of dietary antigens in the aetiology of Crohn's
      disease is controversial, but controlled studies have suggested that elemental
      diets may be as effective as corticosteroids in inducing a remission in patients 
      with acute Crohn's disease. In conclusion, nutrition has both a supportive and
      therapeutic role in the management of chronic gastrointestinal diseases. With the
      development of modern techniques of nutritional support, the morbidity and
      mortality associated with chronic GI disease can be reduced. On the other hand,
      dietary manipulation may be used to treat to prevent specific GI disorders such
      as coeliac disease, functional bowel disease, Crohn's disease and colonic
      neoplasia. The future development of nutria-pharmaceuticals is particularly
      attractive in view of their low cost and wide safety margins.

PG  - 21-4
AB  - In the last years, we have appreciated a descending number of classic enteral
      food-protein intolerance and cases of colitis related to food proteins are
      increasing. In this study, 20 cases of food protein colitis (mainly related to
      cow's milk) are reviewed and clinical, endoscopic and histological aspects are
      analyzed. We found that the age at the time of the first consultation was
      approximately 1.5 months, with males predominating. The main symptom was bloody
      diarrhoea. Other causes such as perianal fissure or infectious gastroenteritis
      were excluded. The infants were fed breast milk and/or cow's milk formula. Some
      patients had low hemoglobin, but low serum albumin was infrequent. The
      colonoscopy showed erythema and, in some cases, loss of vascular pattern,
      ulcerations or bleeding. The main histological finding was an increased number of
      eosinophils. There was a favorable response to the dietary change. After 6
      months, all of the provocations done were negative. We conclude that food-protein
      intolerance is one of the most probable causes of bloody stools in a young
      infant. Colonoscopy and a histopathological study of at least three biopsy pieces
      are necessary for the diagnosis. The treatment is the exclusion of the offending 
      protein from the diet.

TI  - Short-chain fatty acids in the human colon: relation to gastrointestinal health
      and disease.
PG  - 132-48
AB  - Fermentation, the process whereby anaerobic bacteria break down carbohydrates to 
      short-chain (C2-C6) fatty acids (SCFAs), is an important function of the large
      bowel. SCFAs constitute approximately two-thirds of the colonic anion
      concentration (70-130 mmol/l), mainly as acetate, propionate, and butyrate.
      Gastroenterologists have, in spite of these facts, addressed this scientific
      field surprisingly late, in contrast to veterinarians, for whom the fermentative 
      production of SCFAs has been acknowledged as a principal mechanism of intestinal 
      digestion in plant-eating animals for decades. Interest in the effects of SCFA
      production on the human organism has been growing rapidly in the last 10 years,
      because gastrointestinal functions and beneficial effects are associated with
      these acids. SCFAs are of major importance in the understanding of the
      physiological function of dietary fibre and their possible role for colonic
      neoplasia. SCFA production and absorption are closely related to the nourishment 
      of the colonic mucosa and sodium and water absorption, and mechanisms of
      diarrhoea. Patients with severe malabsorption compensate by the fermentation of
      otherwise osmotic active saccharides to SCFAs, which are readily absorbed and
      used as energy fuels in the organism. SCFA production from dietary carbohydrates 
      is a mechanism whereby considerable amounts of calories can be salvaged in
      short-bowel patients with remaining colonic function if dietary treatment is
      adjusted. SCFA enemas are a new and promising treatment modality for patients
      with ulcerative colitis. The effect has been attributed to the oxidation of SCFAs
      in the colonocytes. An impressive number of papers have described the effects of 
      butyrate on various cell functions, the significance of which is still unknown.
      Up until now, attention has been related especially to cancer prophylaxis and
      treatment. Diminished production of SCFAs appears to be involved in
      antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, diversion colitis, and possibly in pouchitis.
      The interaction between bacterial fermentation, ammonia metabolism, and bacterial
      growth and protein synthesis appears to be the main mechanism of action of
      lactulose treatment in hepatic coma. Pathological and extremely high rates of
      saccharide fermentation explain the severe deterioration in patients with
      D-lactate acidosis. Hence, this scientific field has come late to clinical
      working gastroenterologists, but as work is progressing the production of SCFAs
      in the large bowel becomes involved in several well-known intestinal disorders.

TI  - [Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases and nutrition].
PG  - 14S-24S
AB  - The etiology of inflammatory bowel disease is still unknown. Several potential
      mechanisms are discussed. The etiological and therapeutic importance of nutrition
      is controversial. Though changes in dietary habits and incidence of inflammatory 
      bowel disease during the last century were in parallel, no specific nutritional
      factor has been isolated. No dietary prophylaxis of inflammatory bowel disease is
      yet known; all dietary therapies in inflammatory bowel disease aim to improve
      nutritional support and to diminish inflammation by bowel rest. Children and
      adolescents gain in weight and height. Total parenteral nutrition will not
      substantially reduce disease activity and operation rates. Total parenteral
      nutrition can only be recommended in ulcerative colitis patients with severe
      disease in the initial phase and in Crohn's patients with severe malnutrition and
      intestinal complications. Enteral nutrition support is less effective in
      ulcerative colitis than in Crohn's disease. Reported remission rates on enteral
      nutrition are 25% for ulcerative colitis and up to 80% for Crohn. However, in
      active Crohn's disease enteral nutrition is less effective than standard therapy 
      with methylprednisolone and sulfasalizine. It is generally believed that
      nutrition therapy in combination with drugs is the best treatment modality. There
      is no evidence to support the importance of any combination of the formula diets 
      such as elemental, oligopeptide, or polymeric formulations. Administration of
      formula diets by nasogastric tubes all show similar remission rates. Whether
      newer diets supplemented with arginine, glutamine, omega-3-fatty acids or short
      chain fatty acids increase remission rates is not known. Further studies in this 
      field are warranted.

PG  - 1902-6
AB  - There is a body of clinical, epidemiological, biologic, histological and
      therapeutic data suggesting that type I hypersensitivity plays a role in the
      pathogenesis and maintenance of ulcerative colitis. Contradictory evidence from
      different studies on the pathogenic mechanisms may simply mean that there is not 
      one but several types of ulcerative colitis. Chronic inflammation of the
      intestine would cover a heterogeneous group of conditions. Genetic susceptibility
      controlling one of more anomalies of the immune system would be triggered by
      external factors such as respiratory or food allergies, viral or bacterial
      infections or other factors including smoking or stress. The wide range of
      factors involved would explain the variety of findings reported by different
      groups searching for a single pathogenic mechanism. Finally, as emphasized by
      other authors, screening for subgroups of patients with allergy among the
      ulcerative colitis population would be useful in adapting treatment and
      developing a more specific therapeutic strategy not only for acute phases but
      perhaps also for preventive treatment.

TI  - Death of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 in real mayonnaise and
      reduced-calorie mayonnaise dressing as influenced by initial population and
      storage temperature.
PG  - 4172-7
AB  - This study was undertaken to determine the survivability of low-density
      populations (10(0) and 10(2) CFU/g) of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7
      inoculated into real mayonnaise and reduced-calorie mayonnaise dressing and
      stored at 20 and 30 degrees C, temperatures within the range used for normal
      commercial mayonnaise distribution and storage. Inactivation patterns at 5
      degrees C and inactivation of high-inoculum populations (10(6) CFU/g) were also
      determined. The pathogen did not grow in either mayonnaise formulation,
      regardless of the inoculum level or storage temperature. Increases in storage
      temperature from 5 to 20 degrees C and from 20 to 30 degrees C resulted in
      dramatic increases in the rate of inactivation. Populations of E. coli O157:H7 in
      the reduced-calorie and real formulations inoculated with a population of 0.23 to
      0.29 log10 CFU/g and held at 30 degrees C were reduced to undetectable levels
      within 1 and 2 days, respectively; viable cells were not detected after 1 day at 
      20 degrees C. In mayonnaise containing an initial population of 2.23 log10 CFU/g,
      viable cells were not detected after 4 days at 30 degrees C or 7 days at 20
      degrees C; tolerance was greater in real mayonnaise than in reduced-calorie
      mayonnaise dressing stored at 5 degrees C. The tolerance of E. coli O157:H7
      inoculated at the highest population density (6.23 log 10 CFU/g) was less in
      reduced-calorie mayonnaise dressing than in real mayonnaise at all storage
      temperatures. In reduced-calorie mayonnaise dressing and real mayonnaise
      initially containing 2.23 log10 CFU/g, levels were undetectable after 28 and 58
      days at 5 degrees C, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - The value of an elimination diet in the management of patients with ulcerative
      colitis.
PG  - 1176-9
AB  - Debate exists about the role of diet in both the aetiology and the management of 
      ulcerative colitis. To examine the latter, a group of patients with documented
      ulcerative colitis was studied at the Groote Schuur Hospital Gastro-intestinal
      Clinic. A total of 18 subjects, 9 female and 9 male, were randomised into active 
      or control groups and followed up weekly for 6 weeks. Subjects in the control
      group were asked to document but not alter their intake of food and drink. Those 
      in the experimental group had their diets systematically manipulated to exclude
      foods that appeared to provoke symptoms. The symptoms, sigmoidoscopy and biopsy
      findings of all subjects were compared before and after. 'Remission' was defined 
      as the passage of normal stools with absence of rectal bleeding. 'Improvement'
      was defined as a decrease in the number of diarrhoeal stools and/or a diminution 
      of rectal bleeding. At the end of the trial the diet group displayed
      significantly fewer symptoms than did the controls (P = 0.009; Fisher's exact
      test). Sigmoidoscopic findings improved in 8 subjects in the diet group compared 
      with 2 of the controls. Histological findings improved in 3 of the diet group as 
      well as in 3 of the controls. There were no foods that provoked symptoms in all
      patients, though spiced and curried foods and fruits, especially grapes, melon
      and the citruses, commonly caused diarrhoea. In only 2 patients were symptoms
      reproduced consistently on reintroduction of a particular food, pork in 1 case
      and yellow cheese in another.

TI  - Therapeutic efficacy of cyclic home elemental enteral alimentation in Crohn's
      disease: Japanese cooperative Crohn's disease study.
PG  - 91-4
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) often flares up and requires frequent hospitalization and/or
      surgery. Cyclic home elemental enteral alimentation (C-HEEA) was developed to
      prevent flare-up of CD and to minimize patient hospitalization. However, its
      therapeutic efficacy has not been studied in a large patient population.
      Therefore, questionnaires were sent to members of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease 
      (IBD) Research Group of Japan to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of C-HEEA and 
      to define the factors that may affect the efficacy of the treatment. Data for 410
      patients (C-HEEA-treated n = 322; drug-treated n = 88) were collected from 29
      institutions and analysis showed the following results. The cumulative remission 
      and non-hospitalization rates of the C-HEEA treated group were significantly
      higher than the rates of the drug-treated group in all patients and in those with
      ileitis and ileo-colitis (P < 0.0001, P < 0.001, and P < 0.01, respectively), but
      no significant difference was noted in patients with colitis. Cumulative
      remission and non-hospitalization rates were also influenced by the daily calorie
      content of the elemental diet (ED); more than 1200 kcal of the ED per day was
      found to be more effective than lower amounts to maintain remission and to
      prevent hospitalization. The therapeutic efficacy of C-HEEA was shown to be
      superior to that of drug treatment in patients with CD with ileal involvement,
      and it is suggested that more than 1200kcal per day should be supplied by the ED 
      to enhance its therapeutic efficacy.

PG  - 9-12
AB  - The etiology of ulcerative colitis is essentially unknown. A hospital-based
      case-control study examined the risk of ulcerative colitis in relation to dietary
      and other factors. Recruited at 20 hospitals across the nation were 101
      ulcerative colitis patients who were 10-39 years old at the time of disease onset
      and whose disease had been diagnosed within the past 3 years. One hundred and
      forty-three control subjects were also examined. Information on factors was
      obtained by using a self-administered questionnaire. Combined consumption of
      western foods (bread for breakfast, butter, margarine, cheese, meats, and ham/
      sausage) was significantly related to an increased risk of ulcerative colitis
      (trend P = 0.04). Of the six food items of the western food group, margarine was 
      positively and significantly associated with ulcerative colitis (trend P =
      0.005), and bread for breakfast tended to be positively associated with the risk 
      (trend P = 0.07). No appreciable association was found for the consumption of
      Japanese foods, vegetables and fruits, confectionery, or soft drinks. Compared
      with lifelong nonsmokers, current smokers had a decreased risk, and former
      smokers had an increased risk. This study confirmed a protective association
      between smoking and ulcerative colitis, and suggested that margarine or
      chemically modified fat may play an etiological role in the development of
      ulcerative colitis.

      occurrence. The Epidemiology Group of the Research Committee of Inflammatory
      Bowel Disease in Japan.
PG  - 5-8
AB  - Epidemiological studies of ulcerative colitis (UC) have been conducted once every
      year since 1973 in Japan. The number of participating hospitals in 1429 and they 
      are distributed throughout Japan. A total number of 10819 patients diagnosed with
      UC have been registered, including 197 patients with a positive family history.
      In this present study, genetic or environmental factors that may be operative in 
      the development of UC were investigated. After 1966, the annual incidence of UC
      increased rapidly, to a peak in 1974, tending to remain at the same level since
      1975. Since 1975, the daily intake of dairy products and meat increased,
      paralleling the increase in the incidence of UC. The trends of the increase in
      the incidence of UC and the increase in the daily intake of meat were very
      similar. The tendency for UC to occur in families was high, especially in
      first-degree relatives, and the age at onset of UC in patients where there was
      familial occurrence was younger. There was no difference in HLA antigens between 
      UC patients with familial occurrence and the unaffected relatives studied. It is 
      presumed that not only genetic factors but also environmental factors may be
      operative in the development of UC.

PG  - 320-1
AB  - Escherichia coli O157:H7 is an emerging cause of food-borne illness. This
      bacterial pathogen, most commonly transmitted by undercooked ground beef, causes 
      hemorrhagic colitis. It has been associated with the hemolytic uremic syndrome
      and death, mostly in children and the elderly. This article describes three
      patients treated for sporadic cases of Escherichia coli O157:H7-associated
      hemorrhagic colitis at Charleston Area Medical Center over a three-week period.

TI  - Escherichia coli O157:H7 infection in humans.
PG  - 698-714
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the clinical relevance of Escherichia coli O157:H7
      infection, including the epidemiology of the infection and its clinical
      presentations, pathogenesis, microbiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. 
      DATA SOURCES: Articles on E. coli O157:H7 were identified through MEDLINE and the
      bibliographies of relevant articles. STUDY SELECTION: All articles and case
      reports describing E. coli O157:H7 and its infection were selected. DATA
      EXTRACTION: The data were abstracted without judgments about study design. Data
      quality and validity were assessed by independent author reviews. DATA SYNTHESIS:
      Infection with E. coli O157:H7 presents with a wide spectrum of clinical
      manifestations, including asymptomatic carriage, nonbloody diarrhea, hemorrhagic 
      colitis, the hemolytic-uremic syndrome, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. 
      Not only is E. coli O157:H7 an important agent for hemorrhagic colitis, it is
      also one of the leading causes of bacterial diarrhea. Patients at extremes of age
      have an increased risk for infection and associated complications. Transmission
      of E. coli O157:H7 is primarily food-borne. Undercooked meat is the most common
      culprit, and secondary person-to-person spread is also important. The organism
      produces at least two Shiga-like toxins that differ antigenically,
      physicochemically, immunologically, and in their biological effects. These toxins
      are thought to have direct pathogenic significance in E. coli O157:H7 infection. 
      This infection is usually diagnosed from a positive stool culture, from the
      presence of Shiga-like toxins, or both. Timely collection (within 7 days of
      illness onset) of a stool sample for culture is imperative for a high recovery
      rate. Treatment is primarily supportive and includes the management of
      complications as necessary. Antibiotic therapy has not been proved beneficial.
      Important public health measures include educating the public on the danger of
      eating undercooked meat, increasing physician awareness of E. coli O157:H7
      infection, and mandating case reporting. CONCLUSIONS: Infection with E. coli
      O157:H7 presents with many clinical manifestations and should be included in the 
      differential diagnosis for any patient with new-onset bloody diarrhea.
      Development of the hemolytic-uremic syndrome or thrombotic thrombocytopenic
      purpura should raise strong suspicion of E. coli O157:H7 infection and should
      lead to prompt evaluation. If infection is confirmed, it should be reported to
      public health officials.

AB  - Seafaring personnel are exposed in their everyday life and work to factors of
      ship environment contributing to the development of hypomotor intestinal
      dyskinesias, colitis, proctitis, proctosigmoiditis, hemorrhoids. Rations for
      seafaring personnel are deficient in food fibre: 11 g per twenty-four hours, with
      the norm being 40-70 g per twenty-four hours. A positive result was achieved in
      the study of the action of a concentrate of food fibre prepared from wheat bran
      by special methods in patients with hemorrhoids. The above concentrate can be
      recommended for prevention and dietotherapy of hemorrhoidal disorders of the

TI  - Nutritional considerations in inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 597-611
AB  - Although many foods have been suggested to play a role in the cause of IBD, there
      are not yet definitive data to support diet as a cause of either CD or UC.
      Malnutrition is a common occurrence in IBD, and this must be considered in the
      treatment of these diseases. Nutritional support in IBD has limited use as
      primary therapy (Table 2). Even though parenteral and enteral nutrition have been
      associated with remission, relapse frequently occurs when normal food intake is
      resumed. Likewise, fistulae may resolve with aggressive, nutritional therapy, but
      they frequently recur with reinstitution of food. In short bowel syndrome caused 
      by extensive intestinal resection performed in CD, parenteral nutrition provides 
      an important mode of therapy. In addition, perioperative use of nutritional
      support may decrease the incidence of postoperative complications in patients who
      are malnourished. Nutritional support in pediatric patients with CD who have
      growth failure has been effective in stimulating growth.

TI  - Comparison of an elemental with a hydrolysed whey formula in intolerance to cows'
      milk.
PG  - 211-5
AB  - In a double blind study, 40 infants with cows' milk intolerance of various causes
      were randomised to receive a nutritionally complete formula in which nitrogen was
      supplied either as whey hydrolysate or amino acids. The median age of infants was
      10 weeks (range 36 weeks' gestation to 108 weeks' postnatal age). After a median 
      follow up period of 25 weeks there was no significant difference in dietary
      intake between the formulas. Twenty four weeks after entry, weight and weight for
      length improved equally on both formulas. Plasma albumin improved significantly
      on the hydrolysed whey formula but not in the amino acid group. Both milks were
      palatable and normal intakes of formula were maintained. Biochemical and
      haematological indices remained within normal limits. There was no difference in 
      stool frequency and vomiting between the two formulas. Two infants developed a
      probable allergic colitis while receiving hydrolysed whey. Amino acid formula may
      have a role in the management of atopic infants with severe cows' milk
      intolerance who have already reacted to whey or casein hydrolysate formula.

TI  - Excretion of amino acid residues from diets based on wheat flour or oat bran in
      human subjects with ileostomies.
PG  - 596-604
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The effect of consumption of a wheat-flour bread-based low-fibre diet
      (7.8 g/day fibre; 1.0 portion) or the same diet in which the wheat bread was
      exchange for a bread based on oat bran with a high fibre content (31.9 g/day
      fibre; 1.0 portion) on the ileal excretion of amino acid residues and crude
      protein was studied. DESIGN: The study was performed as a cross-over design.
      SETTING: The subjects were studied as outpatients except on the sampling days
      when all subjects were admitted to the research ward and stayed in a nearby
      patient hotel overnight. SUBJECTS: Seven men and three women, all
      proctocolectomised for ulcerative colitis, volunteered to participate in the
      study. One female subject was withdrawn from the study because of inflammation of
      the ileal stoma. INTERVENTIONS: During each dietary period of 3 weeks, food and
      excreta were collected and analysed on days 3 and 17. RESULTS: No significant
      differences in excretion of crude protein or amino acids (free and bound) were
      found between the two sampling days. Intake as well as excretion of all analysed 
      amino acids was higher during the high-fibre diet period, although the relative
      proportion of amino acids was comparable in the two diets and their corresponding
      ileal effluents. Aspartic acid, glycine, threonine, alanine and serine were found
      in considerably higher relative proportions in the effluents from the subjects
      when they consumed each of the two diets than their concentrations in the diets. 
      The apparent digestibilities were significantly (P < 0.05) lower for all analysed
      amino acids during the high-fibre diet period. Aspartic acid (10.7%), alanine
      (9.9%) and glycine (8.5%) showed a more pronounced decrease than the mean
      decrease in amino acid digestibility (6.6%) when subjects consumed the high-fibre
      diet. CONCLUSION: Intake of the oat bran high-fibre diet resulted in
      significantly lower amino acid and crude protein digestibility. The relative
      amino acid proportions in the diets and their corresponding excretas were,
      however, comparable for the two diets.

TI  - Excretion of amino acid residues from diets based on low-fibre wheat or
      high-fibre rye bread in human subjects with ileostomies.
PG  - 589-95
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The effect of consumption of a wheat-flour bread-based low-fibre diet
      (13.6 g/day fibre per portion) or a rye bran bread and whole-grain rye
      crispbread-based high-fibre diet (43.5 g/day fibre per portion) on the ileal
      excretion of amino acid residues and crude protein was studied. DESIGN: The study
      was performed as a cross-over design. SETTING: The subjects were studied as
      outpatients except on the sampling days when all subjects were admitted to the
      research ward and stayed in a nearby patient hotel overnight. SUBJECTS: Six men
      and two women, all proctocolectomised for ulcerative colitis, volunteered to
      participate in the study. INTERVENTIONS: During each dietary period of 3 weeks,
      food and excreta were collected and analysed on days 3, 17 and 18. RESULTS: The
      excretion of crude protein and amino acids (free and bound) was generally higher 
      during the high-fibre diet period, although the relative proportion of amino
      acids was similar in the ileal effluents from the two diets. The apparent
      digestibilities of crude protein and all amino acids except histidine, tyrosine
      and proline were significantly (P < 0.05) lower during the high-fibre diet
      period. CONCLUSION: It was indicated that the effect of the high-fibre rye-based 
      diet was a generally impaired ileal amino acid absorption.

TI  - Molecular epidemiology of Escherichia coli O157:H7 by restriction fragment length
      polymorphism using Shiga-like toxin genes.
PG  - 2150-4
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess a simplified method for interstrain
      differentiation of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and other Shiga-like toxin-producing 
      E. coli (SLTEC) strains. A method based on the use of nucleic acid probes from
      Shiga-like toxin (SLT) I and II structural genes was used to generate restriction
      fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns of SLTEC strains, (SLT-RFLP
      patterns) resulting from digestion of isolated genomic DNA with four different
      restriction enzymes (BamHI, EcoRI, HindIII, and PvuII) used separately. A total
      of 165 SLTEC strains from clinical, food, and environmental sources, including
      O157:H7 isolates from four food-borne outbreaks in Canada and the United States, 
      were analyzed in the study. SLT-RFLP demonstrated that E. coli O157:H7 strains
      from each food-borne outbreak had the same unique SLT-RFLP pattern. Fifty-two
      SLT-RFLP types were found among 96 E. coli O157:H7 isolates from sporadic cases
      of hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome in Washington state. The use
      of the SLT probes proved to be a very powerful method for interstrain
      differentiation of SLTEC strains. Although the use of each of the enzymes alone
      did not give enough differentiative power to be used in epidemiological studies, 
      the combination of patterns generated by two restriction enzymes (EcoRI and
      PvuII, used separately) provided the desired sensitivity for such studies. The
      results clearly demonstrate the usefulness of the method for studying the
      molecular epidemiology of E. coli O157:H7. The method is also suitable for
      establishing an epidemiological database, in terms of both sensitivity and ease
      of compilation and interpretation of results.

TI  - [Milk feeding of infants and cow's milk protein hypersensitivity].
PG  - 526-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cow milk protein intolerance (CMPI) is characterized by a wide range 
      of symptoms and signs affecting the gastro-intestinal tract, the respiratory
      system and the skin. A better definition, a stricter application of diagnostic
      criteria and critical evaluation of certain immunologic correlates can contribute
      to a better understanding and preventive treatment of this entity. POPULATION AND
      METHODS: Two hundred-seventeen infants with CMPI seen between January 1980 and
      December 1993 were included in the study. They were classified into two groups:
      1) acute reaginic CMPI (type I): 125 infants and 2) CMP enteropathy or colitis
      (type III or IV): 92 infants, according to classical diagnostic criteria. Careful
      investigation concerning the type of milk feeding (breast or artificial) proposed
      prior to clinical manifestations was performed. RESULTS: Among the 125 infants
      (aged 3 to 20 weeks) with acute reaginic CMPI, 121 (97%) had been breast-fed with
      a sudden weaning; 30 of these infants had also received one to three formula
      bottles during the first 3 days of life and 14 certainly had not received such
      formula bottles. Among the 92 infants with CMPI, type III or IV, 33 (38%) had
      been exclusively breast-fed, a figure quite similar to the breast feeding
      incidence in our region. CONCLUSIONS: These results clearly show the importance
      of breast-feeding in the personal history of CMPI. Acute reaginic type of CMPI is
      favored by early ingestion of formula bottles in breast-fed infants and by early 
      sudden weaning. Hypoallergenic formula in five cases was unable to protect
      infants against further allergic manifestation.

PG  - 521-7
AB  - Since the early 1970s there has been considerable debate over the role of
      nutritional support in the treatment of patients with acute inflammatory bowel
      disease. The role of enteral feeding as a primary therapeutic option in patients 
      with acute Crohn's disease remains controversial. This article reviews the role
      of nutritional support both as an adjunct to standard medical therapy and as a
      primary therapeutic option.

PG  - S242-50
AB  - Clostridia are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in humans and
      animals. Some of the most common clostridial infections are those of the gut. The
      primary infections in humans are Clostridium perfringens food poisoning and
      Clostridium difficile-mediated antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis. Less
      common but important infections include non-food poisoning C. perfringens
      nosocomial diarrhea and C. perfringens type C necrotizing jejunitis (pig-bel). C.
      perfringens is also the dominant cause of gastrointestinal infections in animals,
      although Clostridium septicum causing braxy in sheep, Clostridium colinum causing
      ulcerative enteritis is avian species, and Clostridium spiroforme causing
      enterotoxemia in rabbits are important exceptions.

TI  - Prevalence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 in a survey of dairy
      herds.
PG  - 1290-3
AB  - The prevalence of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in dairy herds is poorly understood,
      even though young dairy animals have been reported to be a host. From February to
      May 1993, 662 fecal samples from 50 control herds in 14 states, and from June to 
      August 1993, 303 fecal samples from 14 case herds in 11 states were collected for
      isolation of E. coli O157:H7. Case herds were those in which E. coli O157:H7 was 
      isolated from preweaned calves in a previous U.S. Department of Agriculture
      study, whereas control herds from which E. coli O157:H7 had not been isolated
      previously were randomly selected from the same states as case herds. Among the
      control herds, E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from 6 of 399 calves (1.5%) that were
      between 24 h old and the age of weaning and from 13 of 263 calves (4.9%) that
      were between the ages of weaning and 4 months. Eleven of 50 control herds (22%)
      were positive. Among the case herds, E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from 5 of 171
      calves (2.9%) that were between 24 h old and the age of weaning and from 7 of 132
      calves (5.3%) that were between the ages of weaning and 4 months. Seven of 14
      case herds (50%) were positive. Sixteen of 31 isolates were obtained by direct
      plating, with populations ranging from 10(3) to 10(5) CFU/g. Fifteen of 31
      isolates were isolated by enrichment only. Nineteen of the isolates produced both
      verocytotoxin 1 (VT-1) and VT-2, whereas 12 produced VT-2 only.

TI  - Intense nutritional support in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 843-52
AB  - The value of intense nutritional support in inflammatory bowel disease is still
      debated. Claims have been made that total enteral nutrition is as effective as
      total parental nutrition. In this review, the use of parenteral and enteral
      nutritional support as primary therapy in patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease has been critically evaluated. Most studies have been uncontrolled and
      nonrandomized with short-term follow-up. The literature does suggest, however,
      that intense nutritional support may have an adjunctive role to drug therapy in
      achieving remission in Crohn's disease, especially in corticosteroid-refractory
      patients. Nutritional support has a lesser role in chronic ulcerative colitis,
      except for assistance in pre- and postoperative management. The data do not
      support one variety of nutritional support over another, although enteral support
      should be used if possible, as it is less costly and potentially less
      complicated.

TI  - Experimental studies on the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of 5-aminosalicylic
      acid-O-sulfate following local and systemic application.
PG  - 300-3
AB  - 5-Aminosalicylic acid-O-sulfate (5-ASA sulfate), a new agent for the treatment of
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease of the large intestine, was investigated
      for its pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties, following local and
      systemic application. 5-ASA sulfate can be considered as a non-toxic agent after 
      single oral intake in rats (14-day LD50 > 6000 mg/kg b.w.). Oral application of
      2500 mg 5-ASA sulfate/kg b.w./d for 28 days to rats resulted in significantly
      increased body weight gain and food and water consumption. Alanine
      aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase values were elevated in high-dosed
      (2500 mg/kg b.w./d p.o.) males. Relative liver weights were significantly
      increased in high-dosed males and females and the macroscopical inspection
      revealed thickened liver margins. The no-effect level following 28 days of oral
      application to rats was determined as 500 mg 5-ASA sulfate/kg b.w./d. In acute
      local tolerance studies in rabbits, 5-ASA sulfate is rated as non-irritant to the
      skin and the eye. After a single oral administration of 1800 mg 5-ASA sulfate to 
      5 healthy human test subjects, 5-ASA sulfate was almost completely metabolized by
      all test subjects within 3 days; mean urinary and faecal excretion of unchanged
      5-ASA sulfate amounted to only 6.7% of the administered dose. A high faecal
      excretion of the active metabolite 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) (21.2% of the
      administered dose) and a low urinary excretion (1.4% of the administered dose)
      were observed.

AB  - There are two major types of adverse reactions in infant formulas: (1) formula
      allergy/hypersensitivity, which is an immunologic response, and (2) formula
      intolerance, which is a nonimmunologic response. Formula intolerance can occur in
      infants with an underlying congenital or acquired enzyme deficiency
      (disaccharidase deficiency, galactosemia, hereditary fructose intolerance). The
      clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of both reactions are reviewed in
      this article. The appropriateness of the use of a variety of infant formulas is
      discussed. Guidelines for the prevention of allergic disease are described as
      well.

AB  - Malnutrition is common in inflammatory bowel disease; deficiencies of multiple
      micronutrients and macronutrients can present a diagnostic and therapeutic
      challenge to the clinician. Enteral and parenteral nutrition have been used as
      adjunctive therapy to correct or prevent malnutrition in inflammatory bowel
      disease. In addition, some authors have advocated enteral and parenteral
      nutrition as primary therapy of acute inflammatory bowel disease. The efficacy of
      these nutritional therapies in the management of Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis is reviewed.

TI  - [Enterotoxigenic, verotoxigenic, and necrotoxigenic Escherichia coli in food and 
      clinical samples. Role of animals as reservoirs of strains pathogenic for
      humans].
PG  - 97-110
AB  - Toxigenic Escherichia coli of human and animal origin have been classified into
      three categories: enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), verotoxigenic E. coli (VTEC),
      and necrotoxigenic E. coli (NTEC), ETEC are a major cause of infant diarrhoea in 
      less-developed countries and frequently cause colibacillosis in domestic animals.
      Human ETEC strains may synthesize LT-I and/or STa enterotoxins and they may
      possess the colonization factors CFA/I to CFA/IV; porcine strains synthesize
      LT-I, STa and/or STb, and possess the colonization antigens K88, P987, K99 or
      F41; and bovine strains are usually STa producers harbouring on the bacterial
      surface K99 or F41 colonization factors. There is a high host-specificity,
      because of that ETEC from animals are not pathogen for humans. VTEC strains may
      produce three mainly types of verotoxins (VT1, VT2, VT2vp1) that are functionally
      and structurally related to the shiga toxin. The VTEC of human and bovine origins
      produce VT1, VT2 or both, whereas VT2vp1 is elaborated by E. coli that cause
      edema disease in swine. The VTEC strains belonging mainly to serotypes O157:H7 or
      H-, O26:H11 and O111:H-, are now considered to be the major cause of two human
      syndromes of hitherto unknown cause: hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic
      syndrome. Most outbreaks of VTEC infection occurred in USA, Canada and United
      Kingdom during the last ten years and have been linked to consumption of
      undercooked ground beef, and, to a lesser extent, to the drinking of
      unpasteurized milk. Thus, the principal reservoir of VTEC is the intestinal tract
      of cattle. By contrast, it is presumed that human beings are the major reservoir 
      of ETEC, and that contaminated water is a principal vehicle for transmission of
      ETEC infections. NTEC strains are able to elaborate two types of cytotoxic
      necrotizing factors (CNF1 and CNF2). Strains of human origin usually produce
      CNF1, whereas bovine NTEC generally synthesize CNF2. NTEC strains are not
      responsible for food-associated outbreaks of gastroenteritis, but CNF1 and CNF2
      are very good markers of the source of food contamination.

TI  - Prospective study of physical activity and the risk of symptomatic diverticular
      disease in men.
PG  - 276-82
AB  - The relationship between physical activity and risk of symptomatic diverticular
      disease has not been investigated directly. This association was examined in a
      prospective cohort of 47,678 American men, 40 to 75 years of age, and free of
      diagnosed diverticular disease, colon or rectal polyp, ulcerative colitis, and
      cancer before 1988. During four years of follow up, 382 newly diagnosed cases of 
      symptomatic diverticular disease were documented. After adjustment for age,
      energy adjusted dietary fibre, and energy adjusted total fat, overall physical
      activity was inversely associated with the risk of symptomatic diverticular
      disease (for highest versus lowest extremes, relative risk (RR) = 0.63 (95%
      confidence interval (CI) 0.45, 0.88). Most of the inverse association was
      attributable to vigorous activity, for extreme categories RR = 0.60 (95% CI 0.41,
      0.87). For activity that was not vigorous the RR was 0.93 (95% CI 0.67, 1.69).
      Several specific activities were inversely associated with the risk of
      diverticular disease, but jogging and running combined was the only individual
      activity that was statistically significant (p for trend = 0.03). For men in the 
      lowest quintile for dietary fibre intake and total physical activity (compared
      with those in the opposite extreme), the RR was 2.56 (95% CI 1.36, 4.82).
      Physical activity, along with a high fibre diet, may be an important factor in
      the prevention of symptomatic diverticular disease.

TI  - [Development of Wernicke's encephalopathy during the period of oral food intake
      after a subtotal colectomy for ulcerative colitis].
PG  - 169-74
AB  - A 61-year-old woman was hospitalized because of ulcerative colitis which had
      caused fever, vomiting and diarrhea since June 16, 1992. Then she developed toxic
      megacolon, and was transferred to our hospital on the 1st of July and underwent
      subtotal colectomy the same day. After surgery, she received intravenous
      hyperalimentation (IVH) which contained 1,000 Kcal/day without vitamin
      supplementation. From the 8th to the 13th post-operative days, she took 3/4 or
      more of the liquid diet which contained 1,050 Kcal, protein 35 g, carbohydrate
      166 g and vitamin B1 0.59 mg per day. From the 14th to the 23rd post-operative
      days, she ate 4/5 or more of the oral diet which contained 1,700 Kcal/day,
      protein 68 g, carbohydrate 236 g and vitamin B1 0.93 mg per day. During the 7th
      to the 23rd day, the IVH was reduced to 800 Kcal and then 500 Kcal per day. She
      talked less on the 19th post-operative day, and in a few days, her level of
      consciousness began to decline progressively. On the 27th post-operative day,
      neurological examinations revealed the following: semi-coma, almost fixed pupils 
      which were 3 mm in diameter, absent doll's eye movement to all directions,
      flaccid extremities with abolished deep tendon reflexes. Pertinent abnormalities 
      on laboratory data at that time consisted of hemoglobin 7.8 g/dl and serum total 
      protein 5.4 g/dl. Lumbar puncture revealed normal cerebrospinal fluid under
      normal opening pressure. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) taken on the
      27th post-operative day demonstrated, on T2-weighted images, symmetrical high
      intensity lesions in the periventricular areas of the third and fourth
      ventricles, and periaqueductal area of the midbrain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

TI  - Lessons learned in the management of hemolytic uremic syndrome in children.
PG  - 158-63
AB  - Escherichia coli O.157:H7 is a serious and common human pathogen that can cause
      diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, and the hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). During a 
      massive outbreak of infection with E coli O157:H7 in January 1993 in Washington
      State, more than 600 people, mostly children, acquired symptomatic infection, and
      37 were hospitalized with HUS at Children's Hospital and Medical Center in
      Seattle, and six at other hospitals in Washington. Twenty-one (57%) required
      dialysis. Nineteen (51%) had significant extrarenal pathology: gastrointestinal
      in 14 patients (38%), cardiovascular in 13 (35%), pulmonary in 9 (24%), and
      neurological in 6 (16%). Most patients were managed nonoperatively, but three
      required total abdominal colectomy and one a left colectomy. No child had
      perforation. Three patients died, all of whom had multisystem disease. The
      authors recommend (1) that all patients with bloody diarrhea undergo
      microbiological evaluation for E coli O157:H7 before any surgical intervention;
      (2) avoidance of antibiotics and antimotility agents in patients with proven or
      suspected infection with E coli O157:H7 until the safety and efficacy of such
      interventions have been established in controlled trials; (3) that patients with 
      E coli O157:H7 infections be evaluated for microangiopathic changes consistent
      with HUS in the week after onset of diarrhea; (4) nasogastric suction for severe 
      symptoms, and frequent abdominal evaluations, tests (electrolytes/amylase), and
      roentgenograms to exclude treatable abdominal disorders; and (5) institution of
      hemodialysis for oliguria/anuria, acidosis, or rising creatinine. The authors
      recommend surgical exploration for toxic megacolon, colonic perforation, acidosis
      unresponsive to dialysis, or recurrent signs of obstruction or colonic stricture.

TI  - Antibodies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and the apparent influence
      of medications.
PG  - 143-54
AB  - Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are known to have increased
      antibodies to several food and bacterial antigens. To assess selected isotype
      contributions in greater detail, we examined the concentrations of IgA, IgG, IgE,
      and IgG4 antibodies to five selected antigens, two of bacterial and three of food
      origin. Thirty patients with IBD and thirty matched healthy controls were
      studied. Most antibodies were increased in IBD patients compared to controls.
      Statistically significant increases were more frequent in Crohn's disease (CD)
      than in ulcerative colitis (UC). An unexpected finding was that IBD patients
      treated with sulfasalazine had statistically higher levels of most IgA antibodies
      than healthy controls, while steroid treated patients had lower levels. These
      findings suggest differing effects on the immune systems of IBD patients by each 
      of these commonly used drugs.

TI  - Dietary habits as risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 47-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the influence of dietary factors in Italian patients with
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. DESIGN: We studied dietary habits
      immediately prior to the onset of disease in 104 patients enrolled in a
      prospective, epidemiological study of the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease
      in Italy. METHODS: Each patient was interviewed using a recall questionnaire to
      provide information on the daily intake of nutrients. The differences in diet
      between patients and healthy subjects matched for age, sex and city of residence 
      were determined. RESULTS: Our data confirm that patients with Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis have a high intake of total carbohydrate, starch and refined
      sugar. This resulted in a significantly higher relative risk (P < 0.001) in both 
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease patients. Total protein intake was
      significantly higher in ulcerative colitis, but not in Crohn's disease patients, 
      than in controls. Fibre consumption did not differ between patients and controls.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that carbohydrate consumption is significantly
      higher in IBD patients than in healthy controls. Ulcerative colitis patients also
      consumed more total protein than controls. The pathogenetic significance of these
      findings, however, remains unclear.

TI  - Escherichia coli O157:H7: clinical, diagnostic, and epidemiological aspects of
      human infection.
PG  - 1-8; quiz 9-10
AB  - E. coli O157:H7 is one of many E. coli organisms that contain genes encoding one 
      or more toxins similar in structure and function to Shiga toxin. E. coli O157:H7 
      is the most frequently isolated diarrheagenic type of E. coli isolated in North
      America today; this pathogen can cause serious, even fatal disease. Syndromes
      caused by E. coli O157:H7 include diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, and HUS. Poorly 
      cooked ground beef has been the most frequently implicated vehicle of
      transmission, but additional vehicles are being identified. Treatment consists of
      rehydration during hemorrhagic colitis and support of the patient during the
      multiple systemic complications of HUS. A policy of routine screening for E. coli
      O157:H7 in clinical microbiology laboratories, without reliance on the physician 
      to request that this organism be sought or the technician to notice blood in the 
      stool, is the most effective way to find cases. Timely and accurate diagnosis can
      prevent secondary transmission, avert unnecessary and possibly dangerous
      procedures and/or therapies, and detect continuing outbreaks. SLTEC strains other
      than E. coli O157:H7 may cause diseases similar to or less severe than those
      caused by E. coli O157:H7. At present, however, screening for such pathogens in
      clinical laboratories is too labor-intensive to be practical. Education and
      legislation should promote safe food-preparation and food-handling practices.
      Research should be directed at reducing the carriage of E. coli O157:H7 at its
      bovine source, minimizing the microbial content of food and water, and averting
      systemic microangiopathic hemolytic anemia after infection with this pathogen.

TI  - Allergic gastroenteropathy in children.
PG  - 5-12; quiz 12-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the pathogenesis, symptoms, and treatment of
      gastrointestinal disorders linked to immunopathologic reactions associated with
      the ingestion of food antigens in infancy and childhood. DATA SOURCES: A
      computerized MEDLINE search was performed for the following topics: allergic
      colitis, allergic proctitis, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, eosinophilic colitis, 
      cow milk intolerance, protein losing enteropathy, and malabsorption. This search 
      was restricted to the English language and human subjects. Articles published
      between 1960 and 1993 were included as references. The textbooks which were used 
      as references include: (1) Walker WA, et al, eds. Pediatric gastrointestinal
      disease; pathophysiology, diagnosis, management, Philadelphia: BC Decker, 1991;
      (2) Wyllie R, et al, eds. Pediatric gastrointestinal disease; pathophysiology,
      diagnosis, management, Philadelphia: WB Saunders, 1993; (3) Targan SR, et al,
      eds. Immunology & immunopathology of liver and gastrointestinal tract.
      Igaku-Shoin, 1991; (4) Goldman H, et al, eds. Pathology of the gastrointestinal
      tract. Philadelphia: WB Saunders, 1992. CONCLUSION: The symptoms of allergic
      gastroenteropathy may be those of classic allergic reactions or present as
      symptom complexes that may include diarrhea, malabsorption, and protein-losing
      enteropathy. The immunopathogenesis of allergic gastroenteropathy is complex and 
      is still not clearly understood. As our understanding of the gastrointestinal
      mucosal system evolves, we should be able to manage and care for the infants and 
      children who suffer from this group of disorders better.
