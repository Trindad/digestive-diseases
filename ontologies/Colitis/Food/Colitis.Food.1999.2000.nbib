TI  - Starches, resistant starches, the gut microflora and human health.
PG  - 25-37
AB  - Starches are important as energy sources for humans and also for their
      interactions with the gut microflora throughout the digestive tact. Largely,
      those interactions promote human health. In the mouth, less gelatinised starches 
      may lower risk of cariogensis. In the large bowel, starches which have escaped
      small intestinal digestion (resistant starch), together with proteins, other
      undigested carbohydrates and endogenous secretions are fermented by the resident 
      microflora. The resulting short chain fatty acids contribute substantially to the
      normal physiological functions of the viscera. Specific types of resistant starch
      (e.g. the chemically modified starches used in the food industry) may be used to 
      manipulate the gut bacteria and their products (including short chain fatty
      acids) so as to optimise health. In the upper gut, these starches may assist in
      the transport of probiotic organisms thus promoting the immune response and
      suppressing potential pathogens. However, it appears unlikely that current
      probiotic organisms can be used to modulate large bowel short chain fatty acids
      in adults although resistant starch and other prebiotics can do so. Suggestions
      that starch may exacerbate certain conditions (such as ulcerative colitis)
      through stimulating the growth of certain pathogenic organisms appear to be
      unfounded. Short chain fatty acids may modulate tissue levels and effects of
      growth factors in the gut and so modify gut development and risk of serious
      disease, including colo-rectal cancer. However, information on the relationship
      between starches and the microflora is relatively sparse and substantial
      opportunities exist both for basic research and food product development.

      ulcerative colitis to 9 widely used antibiotics. Biosporin action against these
      strains was also studied and a comparison of biosporin and antibiotics actions on
      the same strain was performed. The high degree of bacilli antagonism to
      polyresistant S. aureus strains has been revealed. The clear advantage of the
      therapeutic complex including biosporin as the most effective complex for growth 
      inhibition and elimination of S. aureus from the contents of large intestine has 
      been established.

TI  - Responses of people with inflammatory bowel disease to foods consumed.
PG  - 160-7
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the reactions of people with IBD to foods
      consumed. A database was created to capture the season of data collection, the
      disease, the food, and the subject's reaction to each food. A 122-item food list 
      was used. Sixty patients with IBD (n = 33 persons with Crohn's disease, n = 27
      persons with ulcerative colitis) completed the questionnaire about foods and
      their reactions to the foods in the fall and spring representing summer and
      winter consumption. Foods that made the subjects feel better and worse were
      identified. Although the original purpose of the study was to assess people with 
      IBD as a group, it became apparent that reactions to foods were different
      according to whether a subject had Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Failure
      to distinguish between the two diseases and use only the pooled data made the
      data meaningless. The importance of this finding and themes related to foods that
      had a positive or negative effect on the subjects is discussed in this article.

TI  - In vitro and in vivo effects of gliotoxin, a fungal metabolite: efficacy against 
      dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis in rats.
PG  - 2327-36
AB  - Gliotoxin is a fungal metabolite that has immunosuppressive properties. First, we
      determined if gliotoxin could inhibit cytokine production from macrophage and
      colonic epithelial cell lines, as well as whether it inhibited nuclear
      factor-kappa B in these same cell types. Second, we evaluated whether gliotoxin
      could reduce dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis in rats. A disease activity
      index, myeloperoxidase activity, and cytokine levels were evaluated on either day
      7 or 21. In both cell lines, gliotoxin dose dependently inhibited cytokine
      production and nuclear factor-kappa B. On day 21, gliotoxin significantly reduced
      disease activity (diarrhea and bloody stools) in rats. On day 7, gliotoxin
      treatment significantly improved various indices of colitis, including colonic
      cytokine levels. Decreased food consumption and weight gain was evident with a
      larger dose of gliotoxin. In summary, gliotoxin, a nuclear factor-kappa B
      inhibitor, effectively reduced dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis in rats.
      However, gliotoxin exhibited a narrow therapeutic to toxicity ratio in these
      rats.

TI  - [Parenteral nutrition: indications and techniques].
PG  - 652-8
AB  - Parenteral nutrition corrects for or prevents malnutrition in patients with acute
      or chronic bowel disease. Whether acute (a few days to a few weeks) or chronic (a
      few weeks to several years), there are two pathophysiological mechanisms of bowel
      disease leading to malnutrition: motricity disorders and defective absorption.
      Total parenteral nutrition has to be prescribed in three situations: occlusive
      intestinal stenosis, pseudo-obstruction with complete food intolerance,
      clinically or endoscopically severe colitis. The indication for total parenteral 
      nutrition to allow the intestine to "rest" is indicated in case of digestive
      fistulae with a high flow and for inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease,
      irradiated bowel disease). In other cases, parenteral nutrition can be used as a 
      complement to poorly tolerated or quantitatively insufficient oral or enteral
      nutrition to maintain the patient's nutritional status or correct for
      malnutrition. Peripheral (<3 weeks) or central (>3 weeks) parenteral nutrition,
      like all types of nutritional support, must be complete and conducted according
      to a rigorous written protocol specific for each indication, particularly acute
      versus chronic intestinal disease, in order to avoid iatrogenic and metabolic
      risks. This goal can be best achieved by developing a nutritional team within
      each hospital. Two other important goals are to enhance the efficacy of the
      nutritional support and to avoid inappropriate prescriptions, notably for
      parenteral administration. Such an approach allows a better risk/benefit ratio
      evaluated with nutritional standards. These are the prerequisites for nutritional
      therapy to be recognized as a major discipline in medicine.

PG  - 757-62
AB  - Virulence factors of Verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) strains isolated
      from hamburgers and ground beef were studied in Argentina by PCR. Their virulence
      profiles were correlated with those corresponding to strains isolated from calves
      and adult cattle. Most virulent profiles (VTs+ eae+ Mp+) were present in E. coli 
      from healthy and diarrheic calves corresponding to O5:H-, O5:H27, O20:H?,
      O26:H11, O38:H?, O103:H-, O103:H2, O111:H-, O118:H16, O165:H-serotypes. The
      presence of the eae gene was significantly more frequent among VTEC strains
      isolated from calves (20/26; 76%) than from adult cattle (1/39; 2.5%) (p <
      0.005). VT2+ eae- E. coli was prevalent in foods and adult cattle at
      slaughterhouse. The prevalence of the eae gene was similar between VTEC strains
      isolated from meat (0/21) and adult cattle (1/39; 2.5%) which constitutes the
      main population processed at slaughterhouses in Argentina. Serotyping showed that
      VTEC strains were distributed among 31 serotypes, some of which (O20:H19,
      O91:H21, O113:H21, O116:H21, O117:H7, O171:H2, OX3:H21) were shared between
      bovine and food strains. These O serogroups have been isolated from cases of
      haemorrhagic colitis (HC) and haemolyticuraemic syndrome (HUS) in humans in
      several continental European countries. This study confirms the role of cattle as
      a reservoir of many VTEC serotypes other than O157:H7 and represents a base for
      future diagnostic, prevention and control strategies of EHEC in this country. In 
      addition, this study affirms the advantages of PCR-based screening of E. coli
      isolates given the finding of so many verotoxin-producing strains.

AB  - Mild or severe episodes of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) are common side
      effects of antibiotic therapy. The incidence of AAD differs with the antibiotic
      and varies from 5 to 25%. The major form of intestinal disorders is the
      pseudomembranous colitis associated with Clostridium difficile which occurs in
      10-20% of all AAD. In most cases of AAD discontinuation or replacement of the
      inciting antibiotic by another drug with lower AAD risk can be effective. For
      more severe cases involving C. difficile, the treatment of diarrhea requires an
      antibiotic treatment, with glycopeptides (vancomycin) or metronidazole. Another
      approach to AAD treatment or prevention is based on the use of non-pathogenic
      living organisms, capable of re-establishing the equilibrium of the intestinal
      ecosystem. Several organisms have been used in treatment or prophylaxis of AAD
      such as selected strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus,
      Bifidobacterium longum, and Enterococcus faecium. Another biotherapeutic agent, a
      non-pathogenic yeast, Saccharomyces boulardii has been used. In animal models of 
      C. difficile colitis initiated by clindamycin, animals treated with S. boulardii 
      (at end of vancomycin therapy) had a significant decrease in C. difficile
      colony-forming units, and of toxin B production. In several clinical randomised
      trials (versus placebo), S. boulardii has demonstrated its effectiveness by
      decreasing significantly the occurrence of C. difficile colitis and preventing
      the pathogenic effects of toxins A and B of C. difficile. It has been shown to be
      a safe and effective therapy in relapses of C. difficile colitis. A good response
      has been seen in children with AAD, treated by S. boulardii only. In ICUs
      prevention of AAD remains based on limitation of antibiotic overuse and spread of
      C. difficile or other agents of AAD should be prevented by improved hygiene
      measures (single rooms, private bathrooms for patients, use of gloves and hand
      washing for personnel). In addition the increasing use of biotherapeutic agents
      such as S. boulardii should permit the prevention of the major side effect of
      antibiotics, i.e. AAD in at risk patients.

TI  - Specific detection of bifidobacterium strains in a pharmaceutical probiotic
      product and in human feces by polymerase chain reaction.
PG  - 391-9
AB  - For PCR specific detection of the strains Bifidobacterium longum Y 10, B.
      infantis Y 1 and B. breve Y 8 used in a new probiotic product (VSL-3),
      strains-specific rDNA primers have been developed. Spacer regions between the 16S
      and 23S rRNA genes (ITS) of the three strains were amplified by PCR with
      conserved primers and the nucleotide sequence of these ITSs were determined. On
      the basis of their comparison with the rDNA sequences retrieved from GenBank, we 
      designed new primers which specifically recognize the species B. breve and the
      two strains B. infantis Y 1 and B. breve Y 8. Specificity of these primers was
      confirmed through the analysis of 60 bifidobacteria strains belonging to the more
      representative human species. The feasibility of this PCR method was investigated
      in commercial VSL-3 product and fecal samples collected from 4 patients affected 
      by inflammatory bowel deseases and two healthy subjects before and after the
      VSL-3 administration. By PCR analysis of different VSL-3 commercial batches we
      were successful in differentiating and quantifying the strains B. longum Y 10, B.
      infantis Y 1 and B. breve Y 8. B. infantis Y 1 and B. breve Y 8 could be detected
      at high concentration in fecal specimens of both patients and subjects treated
      with the probiotic preparation, showing a different colonization behaviour. Seven
      days after the VSL-3 treatment suspension, no patients and subjects harbored B.
      infantis Y 1 and B. breve Y 8, indicating a transient presence of these exogenous
      strains.

TI  - Contribution of dietary protein to sulfide production in the large intestine: an 
      in vitro and a controlled feeding study in humans.
PG  - 1488-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hydrogen sulfide is a luminally acting, bacterially derived cell
      poison that has been implicated in ulcerative colitis. Sulfide generation in the 
      colon is probably driven by dietary components such as sulfur-containing amino
      acids (SAAs) and inorganic sulfur (eg, sulfite). OBJECTIVE: We assessed the
      contribution of SAAs from meat to sulfide production by intestinal bacteria with 
      use of both a model culture system in vitro and an in vivo human feeding study.
      DESIGN: Five healthy men were housed in a metabolic suite and fed a sequence of 5
      diets for 10 d each. Meat intake ranged from 0 g/d with a vegetarian diet to 600 
      g/d with a high-meat diet. Fecal sulfide and urinary sulfate were measured in
      samples collected on days 9 and 10 of each diet period. Additionally, 5 or 10 g
      bovine serum albumin or casein/L was added to batch cultures inoculated with
      feces from 4 healthy volunteers. Concentrations of sulfide, ammonia, and
      Lowry-reactive substances were measured over 48 h. RESULTS: Mean (+/-SEM) fecal
      sulfide concentrations ranged from 0.22 +/- 0.02 mmol/kg with the 0-g/d diet to
      3.38 +/- 0.31 mmol/kg with the 600-g/d diet and were significantly related to
      meat intake (P: < 0.001). Sulfide formation in fecal batch cultures supplemented 
      with both bovine serum albumin and casein correlated with protein digestion, as
      measured by the disappearance of Lowry-reactive substances and the appearance of 
      ammonia. CONCLUSION: Dietary protein from meat is an important substrate for
      sulfide generation by bacteria in the human large intestine.

TI  - Rationale for the luminal provision of butyrate in intestinal diseases.
PG  - 164-71
AB  - Short chain fatty acids (SCFA), especially butyrate, play central metabolic roles
      in maintaining the mucosal barrier in the gut. A lack of SCFA, leading to
      endogenous starvation of enterocytes, may be the cause of ulcerative colitis and 
      other inflammatory conditions. The main source of SCFA is dietary fibre, but they
      can also be derived from structured lipids, e. g. tributyrin. Once absorbed by
      non-ionic diffusion or carrier-mediated anion exchanges, SCFA are either used
      locally as fuel for the enterocytes or enter the portal bloodstream. Butyrate has
      been shown to increase wound healing and to reduce inflammation in the small
      intestine. In the colon, butyrate is the dominant energy source for epithelial
      cells and affects cellular proliferation and differentiation by yet unknown
      mechanisms. Recent data suggest that the luminal provision of butyrate may be an 
      appropriate means to improve wound healing in intestinal surgery and to
      ameliorate symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases.

TI  - Clinical pharmacokinetics of slow release mesalazine.
PG  - 85-97
AB  - Slow release oral mesalazine (Pentasa) contains microgranules covered by a
      semipermeable ethylcellulose membrane. The microgranules continuously release
      their content from duodenum to ileum in a pH- and time-dependent way. About 75%
      of the microgranules pass into the colon, where further release is slower. This
      release pattern does not appear to be affected by food, diarrhoea or the
      simultaneous use of H2 antagonists. Rectal forms of mesalazine deliver active
      drug directly to the rectum and left colon. Plasma concentrations of mesalazine
      and its metabolite acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid after oral or local
      administration are the result of systemic absorption and hepatic metabolism by
      N-acetyltransferase. Most studies report maximal plasma concentrations of less
      than 1 mg/L after oral administration of slow release mesalazine, much lower than
      those observed after uncoated mesalazine but generally higher than after
      azo-bound drugs such as sulfasalazine. Urinary recovery is an indicator of
      absorption and metabolism, and is lower after rectal administration (10 to 30%)
      than after oral administration (30 to 40%). Faecal recovery after oral
      administration of slow or delayed release mesalazine is lower than with azo-bound
      drugs. Mesalazine acts locally after absorption by colonic and ileal mucosa. Mean
      steady-state concentrations of 25.7+/-2.2 microg/kg wet weight are found in
      ileocolonic biopsy specimens from patients with irritable bowel syndrome treated 
      for 1 week with slow release mesalazine 1.5 g/day. Intramucosal concentrations
      after slow release mesalazine differ little between healthy individuals and
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Although significant differences are
      found between the various aminosalicylates in release patterns and the resulting 
      pharmacokinetic parameters, no differences in therapeutic effects have been found
      in comparative studies. High doses of oral mesalazine (2 to 4 g/day) are more
      effective than lower doses in the treatment of patients with mild to moderate
      active ulcerative colitis. High doses (4 g/day) are also effective in the
      treatment of Crohn's disease, predominantly in patients with ileitis. In
      contrast, no dose ranging effects were demonstrated with local treatment forms:
      mesalazine 1g enema seems sufficient for patients with distal colitis. Higher
      serum concentrations and urinary recoveries after the administration of slow or
      delayed release mesalazine compared with azo-bound drugs suggest a higher risk
      for renal adverse effects, although the reported occurrence is extremely low.
      Although preliminary data support an association between mucosal concentrations
      of mesalazine and its clinical activity, further studies are needed to correlate 
      the effects of this drug with its pharmacokinetic parameters.

TI  - [Eosinophilic colitis caused by allergy to cow's milk protein].
PG  - 167-75
AB  - Eosinophilic colitis is one of the clinical manifestations of allergy to cow's
      milk during the first year of life. We report a series of 9 infants who, under 9 
      months of age and while clinically well, presented rectal bleeding of variable
      magnitude, with or without diarrhea, shortly after a cow's milk-based formula was
      initiated (n = 6); yet, 3 cases received only breast feeding. Bleeding
      disappeared in all patients after milk withdrawal from the diet. Challenges were 
      planned after 12 months of treatment; three patients have not yet reached this
      moment, 3 had a negative challenge at 12, 18 and 28 months of age and are on a
      complete diet, and 3 are still on cow's milk free diet because ingestion of milk 
      at 12, 18 and 25 months still induced rectal bleeding. This series of patients
      gathered in 3 years, follows the trend reported in many countries that there is a
      relative increase of patients diagnosed with allergy conditions early in life.

TI  - Gastric emptying rate of solids is reduced in a group of ileostomy patients.
PG  - 1285-92
AB  - Feedback inhibition from the colon acts as a potent inhibitor of gastrointestinal
      motility via an array of gut peptides and neural pathways. The effect of total
      colonectomy on gastric emptying was assessed in five healthy ileostomy patients
      (<5 cm ileal resection) and five matched controls. Each subject consumed two
      isoenergetic test meals of contrasting fat-carbohydrate ratio in random order.
      Emptying of solids was measured using the [13C]octanoic acid breath test, and
      liquid emptying was assessed after oral dosing with paracetamol. Ileostomist
      subjects exhibited an increased half-emptying time for solids (P = 0.047), which 
      included components of an increased gastric lag time (P = 0.004) and a reduction 
      in the linear emptying rate (P = 0.003). There was no difference in the pattern
      of liquid emptying between subject groups. In conclusion, the gastric emptying
      rate of solids was reduced in ileostomy patients compared with controls.

TI  - [Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis. When bacteria attack the intestinal
      wall....].
PG  - 48-51
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are clinical entities
      characterized by spontaneous relapses and are thought to be caused in large part 
      by a dysregulated immune response to inflammatory stimuli. Specific infectious
      agents or antigens inducing or perpetuating inflammation, however, are not known.
      Recent results in contrast support the hypothesis, that the normal intestinal
      flora plays a central role in the pathogenesis of both diseases. Studies
      performed with E. coli Nissle 1917 demonstrated that this bacterium can
      positively affect the course of disease in UC and CD patients. The clinical
      efficacy of probiotics can yield valuable information about disease pathogenesis 
      and, as a modification of current standard therapy, opens new and interesting
      therapeutic alternatives.

TI  - Haemolytic uraemic syndrome.
PG  - 243-52
AB  - Diarrhoea-associated haemolytic uraemic syndrome develops in about 5 to 10% of
      children with haemorrhagic colitis due to Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157:H7 and 
      is a common cause of acute renal failure in childhood. Endothelial cell damage,
      white blood cell activation and platelet-endothelial cell interactions are
      important in the pathogenesis. Meticulous supportive care, with attention to
      nutrition and fluid, and electrolyte balance, is important. Dialysis is necessary
      in many children. Public health follow-up is important to minimise the spread of 
      E. coli O157:H7, which is transmitted by person-to-person, as well as through
      contaminated food products. 20-year follow-up studies report that 75% of children
      recover without any clinically significant long term sequelae. Chronic renal
      failure is reported in about 5% of children.

TI  - Allergic colitis presenting in the first day of life: report of three cases.
PG  - 195-7
AB  - Allergic colitis can occur within hours of birth and should be considered in the 
      differential diagnosis of any newborn in whom hematochezia develops. This
      diagnosis should be considered after excluding infectious and anatomic disorders 
      common to this age group. The diagnosis is supported by the healthy appearance of
      affected infants and specific proctosigmoidoscopic and histopathologic findings. 
      Infants with allergic colitis usually respond to withdrawal of the offending
      antigen, by the use of hydrolyzed cow's milk protein formula or more elemental
      formulas, or if the infant has been breast fed, by the strict removal of the
      offending antigen from the breast-feeding mother's diet.

TI  - Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 target Peyer's patches in humans and 
      cause attaching/effacing lesions in both human and bovine intestine.
PG  - 377-81
AB  - BACKGROUND: Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) constitute a significant
      risk to human health worldwide, and infections, particularly with serogroup
      O157:H7, are associated with consumption of a variety of food and water vehicles,
      particularly food of bovine origin. EHEC cause acute gastroenteritis, bloody
      diarrhoea, and haemorrhagic colitis; up to 10% of cases develop severe
      complications, including the haemolytic uraemic syndrome, with a 5% case
      fatality. A virulence characteristic of enteropathogenic E coli, the
      attaching/effacing lesion, is considered to be important in EHEC. However,
      although EHEC produce this lesion on cultured human cells, this has not been
      demonstrated on human intestinal mucosal surfaces. In addition, the initial
      site(s) of colonisation of EHEC in humans is not known. AIMS: To assess the
      association of EHEC O157:H7 with paediatric and bovine intestine using in vitro
      organ culture and determine if attaching/effacing lesions occur. METHODS:
      Ultrastructural analysis of in vitro intestinal organ cultures of human small and
      large intestine was used to investigate adhesion of O157:H7 EHEC to intestinal
      surfaces. Bovine intestinal organ culture was used to examine the pathology
      produced by the same EHEC strain in cattle. RESULTS: The study showed that EHEC
      O157:H7 adhered to human intestinal mucosa. Binding and attaching/effacing lesion
      formation of O157:H7 in humans was restricted to follicle associated epithelium
      of Peyer's patches. The same strain caused attaching/effacing lesions on bovine
      mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: O157:H7 targets follicle associated epithelium in humans
      where it causes attaching/effacing lesions. The same human isolate can cause
      attaching/effacing lesions in cattle, indicating that similar pathogenic
      mechanisms operate across human and bovine species

TI  - Oral bacteriotherapy as maintenance treatment in patients with chronic pouchitis:
      a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 305-9
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Pouchitis is the major long-term complication after ileal
      pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis. Most patients have relapsing
      disease, and no maintenance treatment study has been performed. We evaluated the 
      efficacy of a probiotic preparation (VSL#3) containing 5 x 10(11) per gram of
      viable lyophilized bacteria of 4 strains of lactobacilli, 3 strains of
      bifidobacteria, and 1 strain of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus
      compared with placebo in maintenance of remission of chronic pouchitis. METHODS: 
      Forty patients in clinical and endoscopic remission were randomized to receive
      either VSL#3, 6 g/day, or an identical placebo for 9 months. Patients were
      assessed clinically every month and endoscopically and histologically every 2
      months or in the case of a relapse. Fecal samples were collected for stool
      culture before and after antibiotic treatment and each month during maintenance
      treatment. RESULTS: Three patients (15%) in the VSL#3 group had relapses within
      the 9-month follow-up period, compared with 20 (100%) in the placebo group (P <
      0.001). Fecal concentration of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and S. thermophilus 
      increased significantly from baseline levels only in the VSL#3-treated group (P <
      0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that oral administration of this new
      probiotic preparation is effective in preventing flare-ups of chronic pouchitis.

TI  - [Brucellosis presenting as acute abdomen].
PG  - 276-8, 339
AB  - Usually symptoms of brucellosis are nonspecific and characterized by a wide range
      of complaints. Although the disease in Israel is almost exclusively food borne
      (caused by Brucella melitensis in unpasteurized goat milk products) so the main
      route of infection is the gastrointestinal tract, but gastrointestinal
      complications are rare, and only sporadic cases of ileitis or colitis have been
      described. We present a 43-year-old woman with an acute abdomen, probably due to 
      diverticulitis. It was diagnosed only after blood cultures were positive for
      Brucella melitensis. We believe that its protean manifestations should be
      considered in addition to the other bizarre presentations of this disease,
      important in our region.

TI  - Allergy and mucosal eosinophil infiltrate in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 624-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data on allergy in ulcerative colitis (UC) have led to conflicting
      conclusions without proving any causal association. In this report we have
      investigated the presence of allergy and its possible relation with chronic
      colonic inflammation in patients with UC. METHODS: Fifty UC patients underwent
      clinical, endoscopic, and histologic evaluations. The allergologic study included
      family/personal history; prick/patch exposition to airborne, food, and contact
      allergens; total serum IgE; and quantification of eosinophils in peripheral blood
      and intestinal mucosa. Diagnosis of rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and asthma was
      confirmed by specific provocation tests. Fifty healthy subjects were studied as
      control group. RESULTS: A higher prevalence of allergic symptoms was found in
      patients (56%) and their first-degree relatives (52%) than in controls (18% and
      26%) (P < 0.0001; P = 0.008). In patients skin tests showed increased rates of
      immediate (54%) and delayed-type (20%) hypersensitivity compared with controls
      (30% and 6%) (P= 0.01; P= 0.03). Diagnosis of allergic IgE-mediated disease was
      made in 19 cases and 6 controls (P= 0.01), and allergic contact dermatitis in 10 
      and 3, respectively (P= 0.03). IgE levels were higher in UC patients than in
      controls (P=0.02). No dose-response relationship was found between degree of
      colonic tissue eosinophilia and clinical. endoscopic, and histologic disease
      severity. The degree of colonic tissue eosinophilia was higher in the presence of
      skin reactivity to food allergens. CONCLUSIONS: UC patients frequently show
      several markers of allergy. In particular, our data suggest an association
      between ulcerative colitis, tissue eosinophilia, and type-I allergy.

TI  - Proposed association between ileoanal j-pouch perforation and rapid consumption
      of a high-calorie, high-fiber meal: report of two cases.
PG  - 1008-11
AB  - PURPOSE: We report two cases of ileoanal J-pouch rupture after rapid consumption 
      of high-fiber, high-calorie meals. METHOD: We review the food intake,
      presentation, laboratory and radiographic data, and course of two patients who
      developed ileoanal J-pouch perforation after rapid consumption of meals rich in
      fiber or calories or both. The potential association between food consumption and
      rupture is explored. RESULTS: The authors propose that the rapid ingestion of a
      high-fiber, high-calorie meal may lead to an acute intraluminal pressure
      elevation or a closed-loop obstruction. These effects may be the basis for an
      association between food ingestion patterns and perforation at the distal
      transection site in an ileoanal J-pouch. CONCLUSION: The authors hypothesize that
      the rapid ingestion of a high-fiber, high-calorie meal may be associated with
      J-pouch perforation. Further investigative efforts are needed to confirm this
      association and to evaluate whether a causal relationship is present. If
      causality is established, physicians may develop a higher index of suspicion for 
      pouch rupture in patients who present with abdominal disturbances after the rapid
      ingestion of a high-fiber, high-calorie meal.

TI  - The antioxidant/anticancer potential of phenolic compounds isolated from olive
      oil.
PG  - 1235-47
AB  - In our ongoing studies on the chemoprevention of cancer we have a particular
      interest in the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet, of which olive oil is 
      a major component. Recent studies have shown that extravirgin olive oil contains 
      an abundance of phenolic antioxidants including simple phenols (hydroxytyrosol,
      tyrosol), aldehydic secoiridoids, flavonoids and lignans (acetoxypinoresinol,
      pinoresinol). All of these phenolic substances are potent inhibitors of reactive 
      oxygen species attack on, e.g. salicylic acid, 2-deoxyguanosine. Currently there 
      is growing evidence that reactive oxygen species are involved in the aetiology of
      fat-related neoplasms such as cancer of the breast and colorectum. A plausible
      mechanism is a high intake of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids which are
      especially prone to lipid peroxidation initiated and propagated by reactive
      oxygen species, leading to the formation (via alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes
      such as trans-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal) of highly pro-mutagenic exocyclic DNA adducts.
      Previous studies have shown that the colonic mucosa of cancer patients and those 
      suffering from predisposing inflammatory conditions such as ulcerative colitis
      and Crohn's disease generates appreciably higher quantities of reactive oxygen
      species compared with normal tissue. We have extended these studies by developing
      accurate high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods for the
      quantitation of reactive oxygen species generated by the faecal matrix. The data 
      shows that the faecal matrix supports the generation of reactive oxygen species
      in abundance. As yet, there is a dearth of evidence linking this capacity to
      actual components of the diet which may influence the colorectal milieu. However,
      using the newly developed methodology we can demonstrate that the antioxidant
      phenolic compounds present in olive oil are potent inhibitors of free radical
      generation by the faecal matrix. This indicates that the study of the
      inter-relation between reactive oxygen species and dietary antioxidants is an
      area of great promise for elucidating mechanisms of colorectal carcinogenesis and
      possible future chemopreventive strategies.

TI  - Comprehensive nutritional status in recently diagnosed patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease compared with population controls.
PG  - 514-21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Malnutrition is observed frequently in patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD). Knowledge of the nutritional status in patients with
      recently diagnosed IBD is limited. The aim of this study was to establish a
      comprehensive picture of the nutritional status in recently diagnosed IBD
      patients. SUBJECTS: Sixty-nine IBD patients (23 Crohn's disease (CD) and 46 with 
      ulcerative colitis (UC)) within 6 months of diagnosis and 69 age- and sex-matched
      population controls were included in the study. METHODS: The nutritional status
      was assessed by: (1) body composition (anthropometry and dual-energy X-ray
      absorptiometry); (2) dietary intake (dietary history); (3) biochemical indexes of
      nutrition; and (4) muscle strength (isokinetic dynamometer). RESULTS: Body weight
      and body mass index were significantly lower in UC patients compared with
      controls. The mean daily intake of carbohydrates was significantly higher in CD
      patients and the intakes of protein, calcium, phosphorus, and riboflavin were
      significantly lower in UC patients compared with controls, respectively. Serum
      concentrations of several nutrients (beta-carotene, magnesium, selenium and zinc)
      were significantly lower in UC patients compared with controls. Serum vitamin B12
      concentration was significantly lower in CD patients. Muscle strength did not
      significantly differ between IBD patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study
      showed that the nutritional status of IBD patients was already affected
      negatively at time of diagnosis. It needs to be elucidated whether nutritional
      supplementation in recently diagnosed IBD patients may improve the clinical
      course of the disease.

TI  - Methods for the detection and isolation of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia
      coli.
PG  - 133S-143S
AB  - Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) are an important cause of
      haemorrhagic colitis and the diarrhoea-associated form of the haemolytic uraemic 
      syndrome. Of the numerous serotypes of E. coli that have been shown to produce
      Shiga toxin (Stx), E. coli O157:H7 and E. coli O157:NM (non-motile) are most
      frequently implicated in human disease. Early recognition of STEC infections is
      critical for effective treatment of patients. Furthermore, rapid microbiological 
      diagnosis of individual patients enables the prompt notification of outbreaks and
      implementation of control measures to prevent more cases. Most human infections
      caused by STEC have been acquired by the consumption of contaminated foods,
      especially those of bovine origin such as undercooked ground beef and
      unpasteurized cows' milk, and by person-to-person contacts. To identify the
      reservoirs of STEC and the routes of transmission to man, sensitive methods are
      needed as these pathogens may only be present in food, environmental and faecal
      samples in small numbers. In addition, sensitive and rapid detection methods are 
      necessary for the food industry to ensure a safe supply of foods. Sensitive
      methods are also needed for surveillance programmes in risk assessment studies,
      and for studies on survival and growth of STEC strains. Cultural methods for the 
      enrichment, isolation and confirmation of O157 STEC are still evolving. Several
      selective enrichment media have been described, of which modified tryptone soy
      broth with novobiocin and modified E. coli broth with novobiocin, seem to be the 
      most appropriate. These media are minimally-selective broths that give a somewhat
      limited differential specificity favouring isolation of O157 STEC, as opposed to 
      other Gram-negative bacteria, in the sample. An incubation temperature of 41-42
      degrees C further enhances selectivity. The occurrence of heat-, freeze-, acid-
      or salt-stressed STEC in foods means that it is important to be able to detect
      cells that are in a stressed state, as STEC generally have a very low infectious 
      dose, and injured cells mostly retain their pathogenic properties. For the
      isolation of stressed O157 STEC, pre-enrichment in a non-selective broth is
      necessary. The most widely used plating medium for the isolation of typical
      sorbitol-non-fermenting strains of STEC of serogroup O157 is sorbitol MacConkey
      agar with cefixime and tellurite (CT-SMAC). As some STEC strains are sensitive
      for tellurite and/or are sorbitol-fermenting, the use of a second isolation
      medium, such as one of the newer chromogenic media, is recommended.
      Immunomagnetic separation (IMS) following selective enrichment, and subsequent
      spread-plating of the concentrated target cells onto CT-SMAC agar, appears to be 
      the most sensitive and cost-effective method for the isolation of E. coli O157
      from raw foods. IMS increases sensitivity by concentrating E. coli O157 relative 
      to background microflora, which may overgrow or mimic O157 STEC cells on
      selective agars. While cultural isolation of O157 STEC from foods and faeces is
      time-consuming, labour-intensive and hence, costly, rapid immunological detection
      systems have been developed which significantly reduce the analysis time. These
      methods include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), colony immunoblot
      assays, direct immunofluorescent filter techniques, and several immunocapture
      techniques. Both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies specific for the O and H
      antigens are used for these methods. Many of these test systems are able to
      detect less than one O157 STEC cell g(-1) of raw meat after overnight enrichment.
      Presumptive results are available after just one day, but need to be completed
      with the isolation of the organisms. The primary use of these procedures is
      therefore to identify food and faecal samples that possibly contain O157 STEC.

TI  - Ruminant gastrointestinal cell proliferation and clearance of Escherichia coli
      O157:H7.
PG  - 3808-14
AB  - Human infections with Escherichia coli O157:H7 cause hemorrhagic colitis that can
      progress to a life-threatening sequelae. The most common mode of disease
      transmission is ingestion of contaminated bovine food products, and it is well
      established that E. coli O157:H7 is a transient member of the bovine microbiota. 
      However, the conditions that induce acquisition and subsequent clearance of this 
      bacterium from the ruminant gastrointestinal tract (GIT) are not understood.
      Evidence that the rates of epithelial cell proliferation in the lower GIT of
      cattle are associated with the duration animals remained E. coli O157:H7 culture 
      positive is presented. Cattle with slower rates of intestinal cell proliferation 
      in the cecum and the distal colon were culture positive significantly longer than
      cohort cattle with faster cell proliferation rates. Cell death rates (apoptotic
      indices) between the short- and long-term culture-positive animals were not
      different. Typical grain-based finishing diets and forage-based growing diets did
      not effect GIT cell proliferation or the duration animals remained E. coli
      O157:H7 culture positive. To identify a dietary intervention that would effect
      GIT cell proliferation, we used sheep as a model ruminant. A fasting-refeeding
      regime that increased the rate of GIT cell proliferation was developed. The
      fasting-refeeding protocol was used in cattle to test the hypothesis that feeding
      interventions that increase the rate of GIT cell proliferation induce the
      clearance of E. coli O157:H7 from the bovine GIT.

TI  - Probiotics and inflammatory bowel disease: is there a scientific rationale?
PG  - 107-15
AB  - Most conventional forms of drug therapy suppress or modify the host
      immunoinflammatory response and neglect the other contributor to disease
      pathogenesis-the environmental microflora. Probiotics are live microbial food
      ingredients that alter the enteric microflora and have a beneficial effect on
      health. The rationale for using probiotics in IBD is mainly based on evidence
      from human studies and experimental animal models implicating intestinal bacteria
      in the pathogenesis of these disorders. The relationship between bacteria and
      intestinal inflammation is complex and does not appear to reflect a simple cause 
      and effect. Similarly, the field of probiotics is complex and in need of rigorous
      research. Until the indigenous flora are better characterized and mechanisms of
      probiotic action defined, the promise of probiotics in IBD is unlikely to be
      fulfilled. Because of strain-specific variability and clinical and therapeutic
      heterogeneity within Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, it cannot be assumed
      that a given probiotic is equally suitable for all individuals. Although
      preliminary results of probiotic therapy in animal models and humans with
      ulcerative colitis and pouchitis have been encouraging, their efficacy in
      treatment or maintenance of remission of Crohn's disease remains to be clarified.
      However, the circumstantial evidence for some form of biotherapeutic modification
      of the enteric flora in Crohn's disease seems compelling. In the future,
      probiotics may offer a simple adjunct to conventional therapy with the emphasis
      on diet shifting from one of nutritional replenishment alone to a more functional
      role.

TI  - Allergy and the gut.
PG  - 270-83
AB  - There have frequently been doubts as to the relevance of food allergy, in
      particular as far as the involvement of the intestinal tract is concerned.
      Several studies, however, have confirmed the existence of allergic reactions in
      the gut, with an estimated prevalence of about 1-2% in adults. Clinical symptoms 
      are unspecific and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, cramping and
      diarrhea. Intestinal mast cells, as well as intestinal eosinophils, have been
      shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of food-allergy-related enteropathy. In 
      addition to classical IgE-dependent degranulation, further agonists have been
      demonstrated for mast cell activation, for example IL-4. The methods used to
      confirm the diagnosis of intestinal allergy are still insufficient. Until now,
      blinded oral challenge procedures with food antigens have been accepted as the
      'gold standard' in diagnosing food allergy, although these tests have practical
      problems. Therefore, new test systems have been developed, such as endoscopic
      provocation tests, that may improve diagnostic procedures. Elimination diet still
      presents the main basis of therapy. Aspects to be focused on in the future are
      the role fo IgE-independent allergic mechanisms in intestinal allergy, the impact
      of cross-reactivity with other allergens and the relationship to other
      inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac
      disease and irritable bowel syndrome.

TI  - Food induced stimulation of the antisecretory factor can improve symptoms in
      human inflammatory bowel disease: a study of a concept.
PG  - 824-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antisecretory factor (AF), a 41 kDa cloned and sequenced protein,
      suppresses intestinal inflammation and hypersecretion in animals. Endogenous AF
      production can be induced by dietary modifications in several animal species, and
      this feed has been shown to reduce the incidence of diarrhoeal disease in weaning
      piglets. The role of AF in intestinal disease in humans is not known. AIMS: To
      study the effects of hydrothermally processed cereals, optimised for AF induction
      in animals, added to the diet of patients with longstanding symptoms of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). PATIENTS: Fifty three patients with IBD
      (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) were entered into the study, and 50
      completed follow up. The experimental group consisted of 16 females (mean age 50 
      (SEM 5) years) and 10 males (41 (4) years) and the placebo group of 12 women (41 
      (4) years old) and 12 men (51 (5) years). METHODS: Patients were randomised to
      receive either hydrothermally processed cereals (active treatment) or the same
      amount of ordinary cereals (placebo treatment) for four weeks in a double blind
      study design. Baseline diet and medications remained unchanged. Bowel symptoms,
      plasma levels of AF, and colonic biopsies were evaluated before and after
      treatment. RESULTS: The active treatment significantly improved subjective
      ratings of clinical symptoms and increased plasma AF levels compared with
      placebo. Plasma lipid levels were unaffected. CONCLUSION: Hydrothermally
      processed cereals can induce AF production in human IBD. This increase in
      endogenous AF activity is associated with clinical improvement. Further studies
      are warranted to clarify the exact role of AF in human intestinal disease.

TI  - Distal proctocolitis and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs): the mucosal
      effect in situ.
PG  - 68-76
AB  - It has been postulated that patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) have altered
      reactivity of gut-associated lymphoid tissue. In such cases there is intense
      infiltration of the mucosa with immune competent cells and associated tissue
      damage. We have shown previously that the dietary supplementation with the n-3
      polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and
      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) results in significant systemic immune suppression.
      The aim of this study, therefore, was to evaluate the in situ effect of n-3 PUFAs
      on distal proctocolitis. Each patient received either fish oil extract (EPA 3.2
      g, DHA 2.4 g) (n = 9) or sunflower oil (n = 9) daily in a double blind manner for
      six months. Monthly assessment included: (1) disease activity using clinical,
      sigmoidoscopic, and histological scores and (2) immunohistochemical analysis
      (immunoglobulins, CD profiles) of rectal biopsy specimens (before and after six
      months supplementation) using monoclonal antibodies and quantitative
      computer-assisted video image analysis. Prior to receiving supplementation,
      patients with proctocolitis (n = 18) showed significantly higher numbers of cells
      expressing CD3 (pan T cells) and HLA-DR and IgM containing cells compared with
      non-colitic controls (n = 8). Six months supplementation with n-3 PUFAs resulted 
      in significant reduction in the number of cells expressing CD3 and HLA and the
      percentage of cells containing IgM. There was no significant change in the CD20
      nor the percentage of IgG or IgA containing cells in either group of patients
      with procto-colitis. In patients receiving n-3 PUFA supplementation, there was
      improvement in the disease activity and histological scores, compared with
      pretreatment evaluation. This study has demonstrated both evidence of suppression
      of in situ immune reactivity and concurrent reduction in disease activity in
      patients with proctocolitis receiving n-3 PUFA supplementation. This may have
      important implication for therapy in patients with ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Deficiency of epithelial basement membrane laminin in ulcerative colitis affected
      human colonic mucosa.
PG  - 39-48
AB  - Imbalances in epithelium-matrix interactions have been discussed as a
      pathomechanism in ulcerative colitis, causing a colonic mucosal barrier
      dysfunction. Laminin, the major noncollagenous component of the basement
      membrane, plays a role in epithelial basal lamina formation and promotes
      differentiation of human enterocytes. We therefore investigated the distribution 
      of laminin in ulcerative colitis affected colonic tissues. Tissue specimens from 
      both affected and nonaffected colonic regions were obtained from ten patients
      with ulcerative colitis during colonoscopies or operations. Healthy tissue from
      five patients with colorectal cancer was used as control. After histological
      classification, the localization and distribution of the basement membrane
      associated extracellular matrix proteins were determined by immunohistochemistry.
      Paraffin-embedded sections were incubated with antibodies against laminin and
      type IV and V collagen. No positive immunoreactivity against laminin was found in
      most of the epithelial basement membranes surrounding the crypts in affected
      colonic tissues, without involvement of the subendothelial structures. In
      contrast, a type IV and V collagen accumulation occurred in all these tissue
      samples. The lack of laminin in combination with an overexpression of type IV and
      V collagen, as reported for the first time in this paper, leads to changes in
      basement membrane structure. These findings indicate that the three-dimensional
      network of the colonic epithelial basement membrane and its function are
      seriously disturbed in exacerbating ulcerative colitis. This provides new
      insights into the importance of cell-matrix interactions for physiological and
      pathological mechanisms in the etiology of ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Diet as a risk factor for the development of ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1008-13
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Dietary factors have been considered as a possible risk factor for
      ulcerative colitis (UC). However, available data are inconsistent. The aim of the
      present study was to evaluate the etiological role of dietary factors in the
      development of UC. METHODS: Recently diagnosed (<6 Months) UC patients (n = 43)
      and age- and gender-matched population controls (n = 43) were studied in a
      case-control design. The crosscheck dietary history method was used to assess
      dietary intake of 5 yr before the study. Adipose tissue fatty acid composition
      was used as a biomarker of long-term fat intake. Conditional logistic
      regression-derived odds ratios (OR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used 
      for statistical analysis. Dietary intake ORs were adjusted for energy intake.
      RESULTS: High intakes of monounsaturated fat (OR: 33.9 [95% CI 2.6-443.1]),
      polyunsaturated fat (OR: 5.1 [95% CI 1.0-26.7]), and vitamin B6 (OR: 6.9 [95% CI 
      1.6-30.7]) were associated with an increased risk to develop UC. No other
      significant associations were found with UC risk. CONCLUSIONS: High intakes of
      mono- and polyunsaturated fat and vitamin B6 may enhance the risk of developing
      UC. Whether this observation is a true risk factor in the development of UC or
      rather a reflection of a certain dietary lifestyle needs to be investigated.

TI  - Will recommended changes in fat and fibre intake affect cholesterol absorption
      and sterol excretion? An ileostomy study.
PG  - 306-13
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study cholesterol absorption and excretion in ileostomy subjects
      with different intakes of saturated fat and dietary fibre. DESIGN: Short-term
      experimental study, with four controlled diets in repeated measurements. SETTING:
      Out-patients at metabolic-ward kitchen. SUBJECTS: Nine healthy volunteers with
      conventional ileostomy after colectomy because of ulcerative colitis.
      INTERVENTIONS: Four diet periods, each of 3 days duration: high saturated fat and
      low dietary fibre (STAND); reduced saturated fat (RESAT); high saturated fat and 
      high fibre (FATFIB); and reduced saturated fat and high fibre (RESATFIB). MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Absorption of cholesterol, and ileal excretion of cholesterol, 
      bile acids, fat and energy. Differences between diets evaluated with Friedman's
      two-way analysis of variance by rank sum with Bonferroni adjustment, and post hoc
      differences assessed by rank sum comparison. RESULTS: RESAT and RESATFIB reduced 
      fractional cholesterol absorption by 7% and 10%; RESATFIB and FATFIB increased
      net cholesterol excretion by 46% and 54% respectively. Further, RESATFIB
      increased net sterol excretion by 18%, all compared to STAND (P<0.05 for all).
      All three intervention diets contained more phytosterols than STAND (P<0.05), and
      the phytosterol content was inversely correlated to fractional cholesterol
      absorption (r=-0.77, P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Current nutrition recommendations to
      reduce saturated fat and increase dietary fibre affect sterol excretion
      additively. The effect on cholesterol absorption might be partly explained by the
      content of dietary plant sterols. SPONSORSHIP: Supported by grants from the
      Gothenburg Medical Society, grant numbers 94/086 and 99/082, and by the
      University of Gothenburg.

TI  - Unexpected childhood death due to hemolytic uremic syndrome.
PG  - 90-2
AB  - Two cases of unexpected childhood death due to hemolytic uremic syndrome are
      reported. A 21-month-old girl who was discovered dead in bed following a short
      illness was found at autopsy to have overwhelming sepsis resulting from
      transmural colitis. Escherichia coli serotype 0157A was isolated from the
      intestine, and renal changes of hemolytic uremic syndrome were found. A
      4-year-old girl died suddenly in hospital from intracranial hemorrhage while
      being treated for hemolytic uremic syndrome-related renal failure. Culture of
      urine and feces grew verocytotoxin producing E. coli. These cases demonstrate
      that hemolytic uremic syndrome may be a rare cause of unexpected childhood death 
      and that the diagnosis may not be established prior to autopsy. Postmortem
      culture of tissues and fluids in cases of suspected sepsis in children may be
      essential in establishing this diagnosis, because histologic evaluation may be
      compromised by profound sepsis and tissue putrefaction. Accuracy in diagnosis may
      have significant public health and medicolegal consequences.

TI  - Short-chain fatty acid in the human colon. Relation to inflammatory bowel
      diseases and colon cancer.
PG  - 149-58
AB  - Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are the end products of anaerobic bacteria break 
      down of carbohydrates in the large bowel. This process, namely fermentation, is
      an important function of the large bowel; SCFAs, mainly acetate, propionate and
      butyrate account for approximately 80% of the colonic anion concentration and are
      produced in nearly constant molar ratio 60:25:15. Among their various properties,
      SCFAs are readily absorbed by intestinal mucosa, are relatively high in caloric
      content, are metabolized by colonocytes and epatocytes, stimulate sodium and
      water absorption in the colon and are trophic to the intestinal mucosa. While the
      fermentative production of SCFAs has been acknowledged as a principal mechanism
      of intestinal digestion in ruminants, the interest in the effects of SCFAs
      production on the human organism has been raising in the last ten years. SCFAs
      are of major importance in understanding the physiological function of dietary
      fibers and their possible role in intestinal neoplasia. SCFAs production and
      absorption are closely related to the nourishment of colonic mucosa, its
      production from dietary carbohydrates is a mechanism whereby considerable amounts
      of calories can be produced in short-bowel patients with remaining colonic
      function and kept on an appropriate dietary regimen. SCFAs enemas or oral
      probiotics are a new and promising treatment for ulcerative colitis. The effects 
      have been attributed to the oxidation of SCFAs in the colonocytes and to the
      ability of butyrate to induce enzymes (i.e. transglutaminase) promoting mucosal
      restitution. Evidence is mounting regarding the effects of butyrate on various
      cell functions the significance of which needs further considerations. Up until
      now, attention has been related especially to cancer prophylaxis and treatment.
      This article briefly reviews the role of SCFAs, particularly butyrate, in
      intestinal mucosal growth and potential clinical applications in inflammatory and
      neoplastic processes of the large bowel.

TI  - [Gastrointestinal diseases associated with HIV infection].
PG  - 57-63
AB  - A clinical studies were carried out on gastrointestinal diseases associated with 
      HIV infection. During the 6 years between January 1993 and December 1998, 71 HIV 
      infected cases visited to Yokohama Municipal Citizen's hospital, and 26 of them
      developed gastrointestinal complications during the course of their illness. They
      consisted of 24 males and 2 females, with the mean age of 44.7 years and the
      medial value of 42.5 years. Of the 26 patients, 21 were Japanese, and the
      remaining 5 were Southeast Asian. The mean CD4 count was 143/microliter and the
      medial value was 32/microliter at the time of development of complications.
      Gastrointestinal complications were esophageal candidiasis in 6 patients,
      cytomegalovirus (CMV) gastritis and gastric Kaposi's sarcoma in 1 patient each,
      amebiasis in 8 patients, infectious colitis in 11 patients, and asymptomatic
      pathogen carriers in 3 patients. Esophageal and gastric complications were common
      in patients with low count of CD4, and endoscopy was useful for diagnosis.
      Amebiasis developed even in patients with normal CD4 and was common in males with
      experience in homosexual contact. It seems that homosexual contact acquire not
      only HIV infection but also Entamoeba histolytica through sexual contact.
      Protozoan and acid-fast bacteria were detected at high rate in patients with
      infectious colitis and asymptomatic pathogen carriers. Besides food-born
      infections, imported infections were seen in foreign and Japanese patients who
      had traveled abroad. The gastrointestinal diseases associated with HIV infections
      for the most part were opportunistic infections or tumors but imported,
      food-born, and sexually transmitted infections were also observed. It seems
      necessary to take into consideration of varying background of patients in the
      treatment of gastrointestinal diseases associated with HIV infections.

TI  - Treatment of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 90-100
AB  - The treatment of Crohn's disease depends on disease location and disease
      activity. It can be divided into medical and surgical treatment. While surgery is
      reserved for complications such as abscesses or failure of pharmacological
      treatment (fistulae, perianal disease, or strictures) medical treatment aims at
      induction and maintenance of remission. In order to achieve these goals
      supportive and therapeutic strategies must be used. Supportive measures include
      substitution of vitamins, particularly fat-soluble vitamins, and minerals in
      deficiencies due to resection or disease involvement of the small bowel. All
      patients on long-term steroids should receive calcium and vitamin D in order to
      prevent osteoporosis. Therapeutic options include drug treatment
      (corticosteroids, antibiotics, salicylates, and immunosuppressives), nutrition
      (parenteral or enteral), and endoscopy (dilatation of strictures). Depending on
      disease location different pharmacologic preparations of salicylates or
      corticosteroids should be used, e.g., enemas for distal colitis. The most potent 
      drugs for long-term control are immunosuppressive agents, particularly
      azathioprine. It is the most widely investigated immunosuppressive agent in
      Crohn's disease and should be the first line treatment for patients with steroid 
      refractory, chronic steroid dependent, fistulating, and stenosing courses. In the
      future, more potent drugs and better risk stratification criteria should improve 
      the treatment of Crohn's disease.

TI  - Dietary resistant starch and chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 201-11
AB  - These studies were performed to test the benefit of resistant starch on
      ulcerative colitis via prebiotic and butyrate effects. Butyrate, propionate, and 
      acetate are produced in the colon of mammals as a result of microbial
      fermentation of resistant starch and other dietary fibers. Butyrate plays an
      important role in the colonic mucosal growth and epithelial proliferation. A
      reduction in the colonic butyrate level induces chronic mucosal atrophy.
      Short-chain fatty acid enemas increase mucosal generation, crypt length, and DNA 
      content of the colonocytes. They also ameliorate symptoms of ulcerative colitis
      in human patients and rats injected with trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS).
      Butyrate, and also to a lesser degree propionate, are substrates for the aerobic 
      energy metabolism, and trophic factors of the colonocytes. Adverse butyrate
      effects occur in normal and neoplastic colonic cells. In normal cells, butyrate
      induces proliferation at the crypt base, while inhibiting proliferation at the
      crypt surface. In neoplastic cells, butyrate inhibits DNA synthesis and arrests
      cell growth in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The improvement of the
      TNBS-induced colonic inflammation occurred earlier in the resistant starch
      (RS)-fed rats than in the RS-free group. This benefit coincided with activation
      of colonic epithelial cell proliferation and the subsequent restoration of
      apoptosis. The noncollagenous basement membrane protein laminin was regenerated
      initially in the RS-fed group, demonstrating what could be a considered lower
      damage to the intestinal barrier function. The calculation of intestinal
      short-chain fatty acid absorption confirmed this conclusion. The uptake of
      short-chain fatty acids in the colon is strongly inhibited in the RS-free group, 
      but only slightly reduced in the animals fed with RS. Additionally, RS enhanced
      the growth of intestinal bacteria assumed to promote health. Further studies
      involving patients suffering from ulcerative colitis are necessary to determine
      the importance of RS in the therapy of a number of intestinal diseases and the
      maintenance of health.

TI  - Hepatotoxicity due to troglitazone: report of two cases and review of adverse
      events reported to the United States Food and Drug Administration.
PG  - 272-6
AB  - Two patients (a 48-year-old woman and a 62-year-old man) developed clinical and
      laboratory signs of hepatotoxicity due to troglitazone (Rezulin), a
      thiazolidinedione used in treatment of diabetes mellitus. There was no clear
      clinical evidence of drug allergy, although the woman experienced colitis before 
      the onset of recognized hepatotoxicity. Liver biopsies showed bridging necrosis
      and fibrosis in the woman and hepatitis with granuloma formation in the man. The 
      abnormalities in liver chemistries resolved promptly upon cessation of the drug. 
      Cases involving 46 patients reported to the United States Food and Drug
      Administration are also reviewed. Troglitazone is a useful new oral
      antihyperglycemic agent, but in about 1.9% of patients hepatotoxicity has
      occurred, which may be severe and even fatal. Frequent monitoring of serum liver 
      chemistries in patients taking the drug is essential.

      disease and ulcerative colitis].
PG  - 31-3
AB  - Ovalbumin loading enzyme immunoassay was made in 44 patients with ulcerative
      colitis (UC) and 8 patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Enhanced intestinal
      permeability for macromolecules was found in 87.5 and 65.9% of patients with CD
      and UC, respectively. Blood serum of UC patients suffering from combination of
      food intolerance with dysbacteriosis contained ovalbumin in amounts exceeding
      those in patients without the above disorders 3.4 times (p < 0.05). No
      significant relationship existed between UC patients' high intestinal
      permeability and such indices as age, duration of the disease, intestinal lesion 
      extension, administration of corticosteroids. It was found desirable to include
      ovalbumin intestinal permeability test in examination of UC and CD patients to
      differentiate treatment policy.

TI  - Food-induced eosinophilic proctocolitis.
PG  - S58-60
AB  - Food-induced eosinophilic proctocolitis appears in the first 2 months of life
      with blood-tinged stools. Aside from occasional apparent pain on defecation and a
      few infants with moderate eczema, systemic features are absent. Indeed, aside
      from the diaper, the infant is generally described as well. Thus, in contrast to 
      the infant with enterocolitis, features such as emesis, failure to thrive,
      significant anemia, and dramatic diarrhea are not seen. In contrast to infants
      with the other food-induced inflammatory diseases of the bowel, most symptomatic 
      infants are exclusively breast fed. Proctoscopic examination reveals focal
      erythema, erosions, and/or the nodularity of lymphoid nodular hyperplasia of the 
      rectosigmoid. Biopsies of the rectum and lower sigmoid reveal a characteristic
      infiltration of the mucosa and lamina propria with eosinophils, usually in excess
      of 6 to 10 per high powered field. Elimination of the offending protein from the 
      diet of the infant, through use of an extensively hydrolyzed casein-based formula
      or the elimination of the protein from the diet of the mother of the
      breast-feeding infant, leads to clinical resolution of the bleeding within 72 to 
      96 hours. By 1 year of age the infants routinely tolerate an unrestricted diet,
      and the long term prognosis is excellent.

TI  - Probiotics and inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - S19-21
AB  - The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases remains elusive. However, the
      resident luminal bacteria seem to be an important factor in their development and
      chronicity. There is evidence to suggest that inflammatory bowel diseases may
      represent an aggressive immunological response to the resident luminal flora,
      rather than an alteration in the normal flora. In prior research, probiotic
      bacteria were effective in managing certain acute diarrheal diseases, and
      investigators reported that certain Lactobacilli strains seem to have protective 
      immunomodulating and bowel flora manipulating properties. We report the results
      of recent studies with probiotics in animal models, in which promising effects
      for the treatment of chronic inflammatory bowel disease, pouchitis, and
      ulcerative colitis were observed. Future research may clarify a precise role for 
      probiotic bacteria in managing chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.

TI  - The effect of probiotics on Clostridium difficile diarrhea.
PG  - S11-3
AB  - Clostridium difficile is the leading cause of nosocomially acquired intestinal
      infection in the United States, affecting virtually all cases of pseudomembranous
      colitis and up to 20% of cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Even after
      receiving antibiotic treatment with either metronidazole or vancomycin, 20% of
      patients will have recurrent Clostridium difficile diarrhea. An innovative
      approach to the problem involves the introduction of competing, nonpathogenic
      (probiotic) organisms into the intestinal tract to restore microbial balance. The
      theoretical premise behind this approach is that the protective intestinal
      microflora is damaged by antibiotic treatment; the initial antibiotic exposure
      thus leaves the host susceptible to colonization and subsequent infection by
      Clostridium difficile. A so-called "second-hit" to the intestinal microflora
      occurs when the infected host is treated with flagyl or vancomycin, further
      destroying susceptible bacterial flora. Probiotic agents, such as Lactobacillus
      GG and Saccharomyces boulardii, have been studied for the treatment of
      Clostridium difficile. We are currently running a prospective, randomized,
      placebo-controlled trial of Lactobacillus GG in combination with standard
      antibiotics for the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection. Although it is 
      too early to draw statistically significant conclusions, two patterns seem to be 
      emerging: Lactobacillus GG is effective in reducing the 3-wk recurrence rate of
      Clostridium difficile, and patients feel better when taking Lactobacillus GG, as 
      compared with the placebo, with early disappearance of abdominal cramps and
      diarrhea. In conclusion, the use of probiotics for the treatment of primary and
      recurrent Clostridium difficile diarrhea looks promising. Patients seem to have
      less recurrent Clostridium difficile diarrhea and early symptomatic improvement
      when using the probiotic Lactobacillus GG.

TI  - Probiotics and gastrointestinal health.
PG  - S2-4
AB  - Evidence for positive health benefits of Lactobacilli applies to only a few
      strains used for commercial applications. It is generally agreed that a probiotic
      must be capable of colonizing the intestinal tract to influence human health;
      this requirement disqualifies many of the strains currently used in fermented
      dairy products. Lactobacillus GG, a variant of L. casei sps rhamnosus, has been
      studied extensively in adults and children. When consumed as a dairy product or
      as a lyophilized powder, LGG colonizes the gastrointestinal tract for 1-3 days in
      most individuals and up to 7 days in about 30% of subjects. Traveler's diarrhea, 
      antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and relapsing Clostridium difficile colitis are
      improved with LGG. In infantile diarrhea, the severity and duration of the attack
      is reduced. LGG-fermented milk lessens the intestinal permeability defects caused
      by exposure to cows milk or rotavirus infection. LGG has proven beneficial
      effects on intestinal immunity. It increases the numbers of IgA and other
      immunoglobulin-secreting cells in the intestinal mucosa. LGG stimulates local
      release of interferon. It facilitates antigen transport to underlying lymphoid
      cells, which serves to increase antigen uptake in Peyer's patches. LGG also acts 
      as an immunoadjuvant for oral vaccines. In an animal model of colon cancer, LGG
      reduced the incidence of chemically induced tumors in the large bowel of rodents.
      Extensive safety testing has shown no pathogenic potential in humans or animals. 
      Probiotic cultures of Lactobacilli have the potential to bring substantial health
      benefits to the consumer. The purported benefits for any probiotic must pass the 
      highest standards of scientific scrutiny before the claims can be accepted.

      study, and future research.
PG  - 55-63
AB  - Few clinical studies suggest a significant influence of diet or nutritional
      supplementation on ulcerative colitis. One reason is that ulcerative colitis,
      like many chronic diseases, is multifactorial. This article will describe and
      review the relevant literature on ulcerative colitis, including studies of (1)
      diet and intravenous therapy, (2) nutritional status and nutritional
      supplementation, and (3) bowel flora and immune function and their influences.
      Also, results of a retrospective chart review study that was done at a
      complementary medicine office will be presented. Finally, suggestions for future 
      research will be discussed based on a nutritional model of ulcerative colitis.
      Taken together, it is hoped that these areas will clarify the current status of
      ulcerative colitis research and promote the types of investigations that are
      necessary to establish the validity of nutritional influences on ulcerative
      colitis as well as the mechanisms that are involved.

TI  - Polyunsaturated fatty acids and inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 339S-42S
LID - 10.1093/ajcn/71.1.339s [doi]
AB  - The rationale for supplementation with n-3 fatty acids to promote the health of
      the gastrointestinal tract lies in the antiinflammatory effects of these lipid
      compounds. The first evidence of the importance of dietary intake of n-3
      polyunsaturated fatty acids was derived from epidemiologic observations of the
      low incidence of inflammatory bowel disease in Eskimos. The aim of this paper was
      to briefly review the literature on the use of n-3 fatty acids in inflammatory
      bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease), the results of which are
      controversial. The discrepancies between studies may reside in the different
      study designs used as well as in the various formulations and dosages used, some 
      of which may lead to a high incidence of side effects. Choosing a formulation
      that lowers the incidence of side effects, selecting patients carefully, and
      paying strict attention to experimental design are critical when investigating
      further the therapeutic potential of these lipids in inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - [Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 infection].
PG  - 613-8
AB  - Infections in the digestive tract are due to multiple organism, which cause
      different syndromes. Escherichia coli O157:H7, already identified as a human
      pathogen in 1982, has been recognised as a major public health issue, being
      responsible for sporadic and epidemic cases of haemorrhagic colitis, often
      associated, in children and elderly, with the haemolytic uraemic syndrome. E.
      coli O157:H7 infection may occur everywhere, but is more frequent in North
      Europe, Canada, USA, Argentina and Japan, with annual incidence rates of 8 per
      100,000 population. In Italy until 1997 the Italian National Institute of Health 
      has identified 196 cases of haemolytic uraemic syndrome, in addition, an outbreak
      caused by E. coli O157:H7 occurred in 1993. In Italy the incidence of the
      haemolytic uraemic syndrome is 4-5 times lower than in Great Britain, Germany and
      other European countries. E. coli infection is more frequently associated with
      the ingestion of food from bovine and sheep origin and with infected water. The
      clinical spectrum includes an asymptomatic infection, non bloody diarrhoea,
      haemorrhagic colitis, haemolytic uraemic syndrome. When the E. coli infection is 
      suspected, it is necessary to isolate the bacterium in a specialised laboratory. 
      Treatment is essentially supportive in order to control anaemia and to maintain
      an adequate fluid and electrolyte balance, if necessary with the use of dialysis.
      The use of antimicrobial agents is currently under debate as there are
      controversial data on the risk of developing haemolytic uraemic syndrome.

TI  - Cysteinyl leukotrienes mediate histamine hypersensitivity ex vivo by increasing
      histamine receptor numbers.
PG  - 685-92
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hyperresponsiveness to histamine is a key feature of a variety of
      pathological conditions, including bronchial asthma, food allergy, colitis
      ulcerosa, and topical allergic disorders. Cells isolated from hyperresponsive
      individuals do not display exaggerated histamine responses ex vivo and thus the
      molecular mechanisms underlying histamine responsiveness remain obscure.
      Importantly, several in vivo observations implicate cysteinyl leukotrienes as
      possible mediators of increased histamine responses. We decided to investigate
      whether cysteinyl leukotrienes enhance the cellular reaction to histamine in cell
      types involved in pathological and immunological histamine hyperresponsiveness,
      as this might provide an in vitro system for studying histamine responsiveness
      and could shed light on the underlying molecular mechanisms. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Histamine responsiveness was determined by measuring histamine-induced
      prostaglandin E(2) production. Scatchard analysis was performed to determine the 
      number of histamine H(1) receptors. Mouse macrophages, primary isolated human
      peripheral blood monocytes, and human umbilical smooth muscle cells were
      investigated before and after cysteinyl leukotriene stimulation. RESULTS: In all 
      three cell types tested, cysteinyl leukotrienes instantaneously enhanced
      histamine-induced prostaglandin E(2) production. This increase in prostaglandin
      E(2) production coincided with the immediate and transient appearance of
      additional H(1) receptors on the plasma membrane. CONCLUSIONS: Cysteinyl
      leukotrienes prime histamine responses by recruiting additional histamine
      receptors in immunologically relevant cell types in vitro.

TI  - [The occurrence of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli in humans and animals].
PG  - 671-8
AB  - Shiga toxin (Stx)-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) can cause haemorrhagic
      colitis and the diarrhoea-associated form of the haemolytic-uraemic syndrome in
      humans. The main cause of STEC infections in humans is the consumption of
      contaminated food. Both sporadic cases and outbreaks of STEC infections are
      mainly associated with the consumption of undercooked (minced) beef (mainly
      hamburgers) and unpasteurized milk. Therefore cattle are regarded as the primary 
      reservoir of STEC. In this article the occurrence of STEC infections in humans
      and the occurrence of STEC in food and food-producing animals in the Netherlands 
      are discussed, followed by a brief discussion of possible ways to prevent STEC
      infections in humans.

      O157:H7.
PG  - 625-9
AB  - An epidemic of enterohemorrhagic colitis caused by Escherichia coli O157:H7
      (EHEC-O157) occurred in a nursery school in a rural area of Japan in September
      1996. The EHEC-O157 were isolated both from patients and houseflies collected at 
      the school. The flies were suspected to be mechanical vectors of the pathogen.
      Feeding experiments of EHEC-O157 to houseflies showed that the ingested bacteria 
      were harbored in the intestine of flies and continued to be excreted at least for
      3 days after feeding. Scanning electron microscopy showed that a large number of 
      EHEC-O157 adhered to the surface of the housefly mouthparts and actively
      proliferated in the minute spaces of the labellum. Food masses containing
      EHEC-O157 in the fly intestine were completely surrounded by a peritrophic
      membrane during digestion and discharged rapidly. The persistence of bacteria in 
      the intestine and feces is mainly a result of proliferation in the mouthparts and
      accumulation in the crop. Our results strongly suggest that houseflies are not
      simple mechanical vectors of EHEC. The epidemiologic potential of houseflies to
      disseminate EHEC-O157 may be greater than initially suspected.

PG  - 71S-80S
AB  - Energy-protein malnutrition and the sub-clinical deficiencies of vitamins and
      trace elements, are frequent findings in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, 
      and these may negatively influence the clinical course of these diseases. In
      general, the majority of the patients with ulcerative colitis and uncomplicated
      Crohn's disease can ingest a normal diet that is well balanced and without any
      restrictions. The intolerance to specific foods is rare in Crohn's disease and
      the application of exclusion diets in a routine manner is not indicated. When the
      nutritional status cannot be adequately maintained with normal ingestion, the use
      of artificial nutrition is indicated. Enteral nutrition is the first choice
      nutritional support system if the gastrointestinal tract is accessible and at
      least partially functional. In Crohn's disease enteral nutrition could have a
      specific anti-inflammatory effect ("primary treatment"), and it has been
      suggested that this could be effective to induce the clinical remission of the
      activity bouts of the disease. Some types of dietary fiber could be effective in 
      the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Initial studies suggest their usefulness in 
      maintaining the remission of the disease.

      medicine and food industry].
PG  - 507-15
AB  - Escherichia coli O157:H7 is now recognised as an important human pathogen.
      Illness caused by E. coli O157:H7 infection can range from self limited, watery
      diarrhea to life-threatening manifestations such as hemorrhagic colitis,
      hemolytic uremic syndrome or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. The mode of
      transmission is primarily through food (e.g. undercooked minced beef products,
      especially beef burgers, raw cows' milk and cheese, contaminated pasteurised milk
      and untreated water.). Studies to date indicate that cattle is an important
      reservoir of the organism. Public health measures to control VTEC infection are
      broadly similar to the measures needed to control other gastro-intestinal
      infections. Because of the potential low infection dose, laboratory diagnosis of 
      O157 VTEC in food samples has developed over recent years with the use of liquid 
      enrichment and the development of methods such as immunomagnetic separation. VTEC
      of other serogroups than O157 have no reliable biochemical, serological or
      morphological characteristics (other than VT production itself) to distinguish
      them from commensal E. coli. Thus to detect VTEC other than O157 and phenotypic
      variants of E. coli O157 in food, we have to use methods for detection of
      verocytotoxin production and VT genes.

TI  - Physiological and anti-inflammatory roles of dietary fiber and butyrate in
      intestinal functions.
PG  - S70-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated the effects of pectin, a soluble dietary fiber, on
      the morphological parameters of the small intestine. In addition, we tested the
      effects of butyrate enemas on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced experimental
      colitis. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were fed an elemental diet containing 2.5%
      pectin for 14 days, and several parameters were then determined. DSS-induced
      colitis was evoked by the oral administration of water containing 3% DSS for 10
      days. The butyrate enema (3 mL of 100 mmol/L butyrate per day) was begun 7 days
      before the DSS treatment. Interleukin (IL)-8 secretion in the human intestinal
      epithelial cell line HT-29 was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
      (ELISA). RESULTS: Pectin feeding induced a significant increase in the villus
      height and crypt depth in the small intestine. These effects correlated with a
      significant increase in plasma enteroglucagon levels. Pretreatment with a
      butyrate enema significantly blocked the development of DSS-induced experimental 
      colitis. In the in vitro experiment, sodium butyrate dose-dependently inhibited
      tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced IL-8 secretion in HT-29 cells.
      CONCLUSIONS: A trophic effect due to dietary fiber was directly observed. The
      generation of short-chain fatty acids and the induction of enteroglucagon release
      might play an important role in this process. Butyrate, one of the major
      metabolites of dietary fiber, exerted a potent anti-inflammatory effect both in
      vivo and in vitro. Dietary fiber may therefore play important roles in the
      regulation of normal and pathological conditions in the intestine.

TI  - Essential fatty acids in health and chronic disease.
PG  - 560S-569S
LID - 10.1093/ajcn/70.3.560s [doi]
AB  - Human beings evolved consuming a diet that contained about equal amounts of n-3
      and n-6 essential fatty acids. Over the past 100-150 y there has been an enormous
      increase in the consumption of n-6 fatty acids due to the increased intake of
      vegetable oils from corn, sunflower seeds, safflower seeds, cottonseed, and
      soybeans. Today, in Western diets, the ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids ranges
      from approximately 20-30:1 instead of the traditional range of 1-2:1. Studies
      indicate that a high intake of n-6 fatty acids shifts the physiologic state to
      one that is prothrombotic and proaggregatory, characterized by increases in blood
      viscosity, vasospasm, and vasoconstriction and decreases in bleeding time. n-3
      Fatty acids, however, have antiinflammatory, antithrombotic, antiarrhythmic,
      hypolipidemic, and vasodilatory properties. These beneficial effects of n-3 fatty
      acids have been shown in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease,
      hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and, in some patients with renal disease,
      rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease, and chronic obstructive 
      pulmonary disease. Most of the studies were carried out with fish oils
      [eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)]. However,
      alpha-linolenic acid, found in green leafy vegetables, flaxseed, rapeseed, and
      walnuts, desaturates and elongates in the human body to EPA and DHA and by itself
      may have beneficial effects in health and in the control of chronic diseases.

TI  - Impact on the composition of the faecal flora by a new probiotic preparation:
      preliminary data on maintenance treatment of patients with ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1103-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) oral compounds are the
      standard maintenance treatment for ulcerative colitis in remission, some patients
      cannot use them because of side-effects. Clinical and experimental observations
      have suggested the potential role of probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease
      therapy. AIM: To evaluate the effects on intestinal microflora and the clinical
      efficacy of a new probiotic preparation in patients with ulcerative colitis in
      remission. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with ulcerative colitis,
      intolerant or allergic to 5-ASA, have been treated with a new probiotic
      preparation (VSL#3, CSL, Milan, Italy) containing 5x10(11) cells/g of 3 strains
      of bifidobacteria, 4 strains of lactobacilli and 1 strain of Streptococcus
      salivarius ssp. thermophilus. Two doses of 3 g were administered o.d. for 12
      months. Faecal samples for stool culture were obtained from the patients at the
      beginning of the trial and after 10, 20, 40, 60, 75, 90 days, 12 months and at 15
      days after the end of the treatment. The following bacterial groups have been
      evaluated in the faeces: total aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, enterococci,
      Streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, Bacteroides,
      clostridia, coliforms. Patients were assessed clinically every two months, and
      assessed endoscopically at 6 and 12 months or in relapse. RESULTS: Faecal
      concentrations of Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus, lactobacilli and
      bifidobacteria increased significantly in all patients, compared to their basal
      level, from the 20th day of treatment (P<0.05) and remained stable throughout the
      study. Concentrations of Bacteroides, clostridia, coliforms, total aerobic and
      anaerobic bacteria did not change significantly during treatment (P = N.S.).
      Fifteen of 20 treated patients remained in remission during the study, one
      patient was lost to follow up, while the remaining relapsed. No significant
      side-effects have been reported. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that this
      probiotic preparation is able to colonize the intestine, and suggest that it may 
      be useful in maintaining the remission in ulcerative colitis patients intolerant 
      or allergic to 5-ASA. Controlled trials are warranted to confirm these
      preliminary results.

TI  - Non-pathogenic Escherichia coli versus mesalazine for the treatment of ulcerative
      colitis: a randomised trial.
PG  - 635-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis has been suggested to be caused by infection and
      there is circumstantial evidence linking Escherichia coli with the condition. Our
      aim was to find out whether the administration of a non-pathogenic strain of E.
      coli (Nissle 1917) was as effective as mesalazine in preventing relapse of
      ulcerative colitis. We also examined whether the addition of E. coli to standard 
      medical therapy increased the chance of remission of active ulcerative colitis.
      METHODS: This was a single-centre, randomised, double-dummy study in which 120
      patients with active ulcerative colitis were invited to take part. 116 patients
      accepted; 59 were randomised to mesalazine and 57 to E. coli. All patients also
      received standard medical therapy together with a 1-week course of oral
      gentamicin. After remission, patients were maintained on either mesalazine or E. 
      coli and followed up for a maximum of 12 months. A two-stage, conditional,
      intention-to-treat analysis was done. FINDINGS: 44 (75%) patients in the
      mesalazine group attained remission compared with 39 (68%) in the E. coli group. 
      Mean time to remission was 44 days (median 42) in the mesalazine group and 42
      days (median 37) for those treated with E. coli. In the mesalazine group, 32
      (73%) patients relapsed compared with 26 (67%) in the E. coli group. Mean
      duration of remission was 206 days in the mesalazine group (median 175) and 221
      days (median 185) in the E. coli group. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that 
      treatment with a non-pathogenic E. coli has an equivalent effect to mesalazine in
      maintaining remission of ulcerative colitis. The beneficial effect of live E.
      coli may provide clues to the cause of ulcerative colitis.

TI  - The relationship between habits of food consumption and reported reactions to
      food in people with inflammatory bowel disease--testing the limits.
PG  - 69-83
AB  - Anecdotally, people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) report that some foods 
      make them feel better and some foods make them feel worse. This paper reports
      about the relationship between food habits and reactions to foods in people with 
      IBD. A database was designed to incorporate the date of data collection, the IBD 
      disease, food habits, the quantity consumed and a response rating of the
      subjects' reactions to each food. For each of 122 foods, subjects were asked
      simultaneously about these five categories. Thirty three subjects with Crohn's
      disease and 27 with ulcerative colitis completed the questionnaire in two
      seasons. The focus of the examination was directed to the upper and lower limit
      of reactions to foods. Foods that affect people negatively and foods that affect 
      people positively were identified in relation to habits of consumption. Foods
      that affect people negatively were among those never consumed while foods that
      affect people positively were among the regularly consumed foods. Findings
      included an increased number of foods that caused problems for people with
      Crohn's disease when compared with people with ulcerative colitis. Problems with 
      chocolate, dairy products, fats and artificial sweeteners were documented in both
      groups of IBD. A standard food list generated without the input of individuals
      with a chronic illness may be inadequate to collect data about their consumption 
      since many of the foods on the list were reportedly never consumed and there may 
      be other foods not on the list that are consumed by this chronically ill
      population.

TI  - Human intestinal mast cells produce IL-5 in vitro upon IgE receptor cross-linking
      and in vivo in the course of intestinal inflammatory disease.
PG  - 1496-503
AB  - IL-5, known to be produced by T lymphocytes and eosinophils, is a key regulator
      of intestinal diseases such as parasitosis or eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Here 
      we examined if mast cells contribute to the IL-5 production in human intestinal
      mucosa. The number of IL-5-positive lamina propria cells was substantially higher
      in patients with intestinal inflammatory diseases (5.3 +/- 4.6%, n = 17) compared
      to healthy controls (0.5 +/- 0.9%, n = 8, p < 0.01). In patients, the
      IL-5-positive cells were eosinophils (70 +/- 13%) and mast cells (29 +/- 14%),
      whereas in controls all IL-5-positive cells were eosinophils. IL-5-positive T
      cells were not detected, likely because they do not store IL-5. In vitro studies 
      with isolated human intestinal mast cells and eosinophils showed that mast cells 
      do not produce IL-5 constitutively, but release high amounts of IL-5 (315 +/- 115
      pg/10(6) cells) following IgE receptor cross-linking, compared to activated
      eosinophils (24 +/- 5 pg/10(6) cells). Inhibitor studies suggest a regulation of 
      IL-5 production at the transcriptional level. In conclusion our data demonstrate 
      that activated mast cells are a potent source of IL-5 in the human intestinal
      mucosa.

TI  - Antitumor necrosis factor therapy for inflammatory bowel disease: a review of
      agents, pharmacology, clinical results, and safety.
PG  - 119-33
AB  - Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), a proinflammatory cytokine, plays an
      important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
      Biotechnology agents including a chimeric monoclonal anti-TNF antibody
      (infliximab), a humanized monoclonal anti-TNF antibody (CDP571), and a
      recombinant TNF receptor fusion protein (etanercept) have been used to inhibit
      TNFalpha activity. Controlled trials have demonstrated efficacy for infliximab in
      moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (CD) and fistulizing CD sufficient 
      to justify recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Additional
      trials have been completed in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Similarly, preliminary
      controlled trials have suggested efficacy for CDP571 in active CD and RA. Larger 
      controlled trials have demonstrated efficacy for etanercept in RA patients who
      have failed disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy leading to FDA
      approval for RA. Toxicities observed with anti-TNF therapies have included
      formation of human antichimeric antibodies (HACA) with associated acute and
      delayed hypersensitivity infusion reactions, human antihuman antibodies (HAHAs), 
      and formation of autoantibodies with rare instances of drug-induced lupus.
      Several cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma also has been described. Future studies
      should evaluate optimal timing and duration of anti-TNF therapy, the utility of
      adjuvant medical treatments during anti-TNF therapy, and evaluate long-term
      safety and efficacy of the various anti-TNF agents.

TI  - Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in Japanese patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease: prevalence and recognition of putative antigens.
PG  - 1304-12
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to investigate the prevalence of antineutrophil
      cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) in Japanese patients with ulcerative colitis (UC)
      and Crohn's disease (CD), and the putative antigens recognized by perinuclear
      staining pattern ANCA (p-ANCA)-positive sera. METHODS: Sera from UC (n = 52) and 
      CD (n = 43) patients, and from healthy controls (n = 74) were studied. The
      indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) method was used for the detection of ANCA and
      its binding pattern. p-ANCA-positive sera were studied further for putative
      antigens. ELISAs using lactoferrin (Lf), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and cathepsin G
      (Cat G) as antigens were performed. RESULTS: ANCA was positive in 40 of the 52
      (76.9%) UC (p-ANCA in 33) and in 32 of the 43 (74.4%) CD (p-ANCA in 31) patients.
      UC and CD patients showed significantly higher titers of p-ANCA than controls;
      however, no significant difference was observed between UC and CD. In UC, 23, 17,
      and nine of the 33 patients with p-ANCA-positive sera showed reactivity with Lf, 
      MPO, and Cat-G, respectively. In CD, 21, 20, and 11 of the 31 patients with
      p-ANCA-positive sera showed reactivity with Lf, MPO, and Cat-G, respectively.
      Fourteen of the UC and six of the CD patients showed reactivity with two
      different antigens, and seven of the UC and 11 of the CD patients showed
      reactivity with all three antigens. The presence of anti-Lf and anti-MPO
      antibodies was further confirmed by Western blotting. CONCLUSIONS: ANCA is useful
      in distinguishing patients with IBD from normal subjects but is not sufficient
      for the differential diagnosis of CD and UC. p-ANCA reactivity might be derived
      from the recognition of heterogeneous neutrophil-associated antigens.

TI  - Clinical experiences in Sakai City Hospital during the massive outbreak of
      enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157 infections in Sakai City, 1996.
PG  - 213-7
AB  - In the middle of July, 1996, a massive outbreak of hemorrhagic colitis (HC)
      occurred among elementary schoolchildren in Sakai city. This is the most
      widespread outbreak of O157 infection ever experienced to our knowledge. Lunch
      foods supplied in the elementary schools in Sakai were contaminated by
      Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157. One hundred and twenty-one cases developed
      hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) from 12,680 symptomatic patients, including
      putative secondary infections, and three girls died during this outbreak. Sakai
      City Hospital is one of the core medical facilities in this community; hence, 425
      children with HC were treated at the hospital. Antibiotics were used extensively 
      on all patients. Among them, 12 children developed HUS. All 425 children,
      including the patients with HUS, recovered without significant sequelae. In the
      present paper, the clinical experiences during this massive outbreak of E. coli
      O157 infection in Sakai City Hospital are described.

TI  - Local and systemic liberation of proinflammatory cytokines in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 830-5
AB  - Determination of plasma and tissue cytokine levels in inflammatory bowel disease 
      have frequently resulted in conflicting data. In the present study we determined 
      in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), the levels of the proinflammatory
      cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, interferon (IFN)-gamma, and
      tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha liberated by peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      (PBMC) and lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) after 48-hr culture with
      pokeweed mitogen (PWM). IL-1beta, IL-6, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha in the
      supernatant were detected by ELISA. Results show low basal levels of IL-1beta
      secretion by PBMC and LPMC, and a considerable increase after mitogen
      stimulation. Basal IL-6 production by PBMC was higher in UC patients than in
      controls [2029 pg/ml, CI95(-165 to 4223) vs 572 pg/ml (-383 to 1527)
      respectively, P = 0.05] and also after PWM activation [14,995 pg/ml (7759-22,230)
      vs 6598 pg/ml (3240-9956), respectively, P = 0.05]. In LPMC, no differences in
      IL-6 secretion were observed. TNF-alpha in activated PBMC of patients with UC was
      not significantly increased in relation to control (P = 0.09). No constitutive
      secretion of IFN-gamma was observed in mononuclear cells. IFN-gamma levels
      secreted by activated LPMC were lower in patients with UC than in controls [1571 
      pg/ml (-108 to 3251) vs 7953 pg/ml (3851-12,055), respectively, P = 0.03]. These 
      results suggest that IL-6, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha participate as mediators in
      the inflammatory phenomena observed in UC. Further studies are necessary to
      evaluate the role of IFN-gamma in this condition.

TI  - Changes in bacterial enzymes and PCR profiles of fecal bacteria from a patient
      with ulcerative colitis before and after antimicrobial treatments.
PG  - 637-42
AB  - A 26-year-old female patient, suffering from recurrent attacks of ulcerative
      colitis accompanied by extraintestinal symptoms (erythema nodosum and pyoderma
      gangrenosum), was evaluated for the effect of antibacterial agents on the
      intestinal bacteria and their enzymatic activities. The enzymes were assayed both
      at the onset of disease symptoms and after treatment with each of five drug
      regimens (fluconazole and cefadroxil, cefuroxime axetil and cestriaxone sodium,
      ciprofloxacin and cestriaxone sodium, ciprofloxacin alone, and ciprofloxacin,
      metronidazole, and cephalexin). The activities of azoreductase, nitroreductase,
      oxidoreductase, glucuronidase, and sulfatase were generally lower following all
      of the treatments, especially when ciprofloxacin was included. The DNA from each 
      sample was amplified by PCR, using random primers. Profiles of amplified DNA on
      agarose gels showed different patterns, indicating differences in the microflora 
      before and after the antimicrobial treatments. The clinical response to
      antibacterial therapy was consistent with the decreased bacterial enzymatic
      activities and changes in the microbial population. Ciprofloxacin, which was
      associated with the most dramatic falls in enzymatic activity, also had the best 
      clinical results. We conclude that intestinal bacteria and their enzymes play
      important roles in ulcerative colitis and that population changes can be
      monitored using PCR profiles.

      malabsorption, although fructose (17), sucrose (8) and lactulose (2) were also
      occasionally administered. One hundred eleven tests (50 percent) were positive,
      with an increase of at least 10 ppm hydrogen above the fasting level and a
      maximum value most commonly observed (42.3 percent of the time) at 3 hours
      post-administration. Only 34 patients (15.3 percent) had symptoms noted during
      the test, as compared with 185 (83.3 percent) who had experienced persistent
      intestinal problems prior to the test. Recent conditions which may have caused
      intestinal distress, such as transient disaccharidase deficiency, infections,
      surgery or other disorders like Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis or food
      poisoning, were recorded in only 14 cases. Patterns consistent with bacterial
      overgrowth of the small intestine were observed in only 3 cases. Of 111
      positives, 9 cases had increases between 10 and 20 ppm hydrogen and 7 showed the 
      increase in the 3-hour sample, possibly reflecting a delayed transit through the 
      intestine. Final diagnoses in 6 of these where information was available were for
      conditions other than malabsorption. We conclude that using a rise of 10 ppm to
      interpret a positive test does not contribute significantly to an increased
      frequency of false positives, but that patients with increases between 10 and 20 
      ppm probably are not lactase deficient.

TI  - Randomized clinical trial of Plantago ovata seeds (dietary fiber) as compared
      with mesalamine in maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis. Spanish Group for
      the Study of Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis (GETECCU).
PG  - 427-33
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Butyrate enemas may be effective in the treatment of active distal
      ulcerative colitis. Because colonic fermentation of Plantago ovata seeds (dietary
      fiber) yields butyrate, the aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and
      safety of Plantago ovata seeds as compared with mesalamine in maintaining
      remission in ulcerative colitis. METHODS: An open label, parallel-group,
      multicenter, randomized clinical trial was conducted. A total of 105 patients
      with ulcerative colitis who were in remission were randomized into groups to
      receive oral treatment with Plantago ovata seeds (10 g b.i.d.), mesalamine (500
      mg t.i.d.), and Plantago ovata seeds plus mesalamine at the same doses. The
      primary efficacy outcome was maintenance of remission for 12 months. RESULTS: Of 
      the 105 patients, 102 were included in the final analysis. After 12 months,
      treatment failure rate was 40% (14 of 35 patients) in the Plantago ovata seed
      group, 35% (13 of 37) in the mesalamine group, and 30% (nine of 30) in the
      Plantago ovata plus mesalamine group. Probability of continued remission was
      similar (Mantel-Cox test, p = 0.67; intent-to-treat analysis). Therapy effects
      remained unchanged after adjusting for potential confounding variables with a
      Cox's proportional hazards survival analysis. Three patients were withdrawn
      because of the development of adverse events consisting of constipation and/or
      flatulence (Plantago ovata seed group = 1 and Plantago ovata seed plus mesalamine
      group = 2). A significant increase in fecal butyrate levels (p = 0.018) was
      observed after Plantago ovata seed administration. CONCLUSIONS: Plantago ovata
      seeds (dietary fiber) might be as effective as mesalamine to maintain remission
      in ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Epidemic of gastrointestinal tract infection including hemorrhagic colitis
      attributable to Shiga toxin 1-producing Escherichia coli O118:H2 at a junior high
      school in Japan.
PG  - E2
AB  - BACKGROUND: An epidemic of gastrointestinal disturbances related to food
      ingestion occurred at a junior high school in Komatsu, Japan, and was caused by
      specifically Shiga toxin (Stx) 1-producing Escherichia coli O118:H2, which has
      not been reported previously in humans. No outbreak of E coli-producing Stx 1
      alone had occurred. METHODS: A total of 526 students and 35 adult staff members
      who ate the same food at lunch in the school were investigated. Questionnaires
      about food consumption at lunch were given to all 561 subjects as well as to
      clinics and hospitals that had treated 79 patients. Stool specimens from 525
      subjects, and food, water, and environmental specimens, including cooking
      utensils, were collected in an attempt to identify the pathogen. RESULTS: A total
      of 126 subjects (22.5%) developed a diarrheal illness. The pathogen was isolated 
      from the stool in 131 subjects, 49 of which were asymptomatic, and from a dipper.
      Salads served over several days were identified as high-risk from food analysis. 
      Gastrointestinal symptoms resembled those associated with previous infections of 
      Stx-producing E coli, but were mild. No cases of the hemolytic-uremic syndrome
      developed. Headache was present in 87 patients. Three patients underwent surgery 
      for acute appendicitis during this epidemic. Four of five carriers had received
      an antibiotic effective against the pathogen. CONCLUSIONS: This outbreak of E
      coli O118:H2 demonstrated the clinical and epidemiologic features of infection by
      E coli that produces Stx 1 alone. Infections with such organisms are being
      recognized increasingly, and the pattern of disease observed may differ from the 
      pattern observed with E coli O157:H7.

TI  - Effector and regulatory lymphoid cells and cytokines in mucosal sites.
PG  - 113-35
AB  - In this review, I hope to have highlighted that cytokines are of crucial
      importance in the normal homeostasis of the gut immune system, the interactions
      of the gut immune system with enteric antigens and also in tissue injury
      associated with IBD. There is evidence from a number of different systems that
      the response to nominal non-replicating antigens, administered nasally or orally,
      is skewed towards a non-Th1 type of response. To say that the response is Th2,
      Th3 or Tr is premature. IL-10 and TGF beta seem to be important in downregulating
      potentially tissue-damaging Th1 responses to the normal flora and possibly food
      antigens. However, it need to be seen whether the mouse results also apply to
      humans. A consistent pattern in disease states, whether it be human or mouse, is 
      an exaggerated Th1 type response with excess local production of IFN-gamma and
      TNF alpha, and its association with tissue injury. An important question to
      address is whether this represents a switch from the Th2, Th3, or Tr pathway
      towards a Th1 pathway, or whether the Th1 pathway is in fact always present in
      the gut, but is kept in check and non-pathogenic by regulatory cells. Equally
      important is the need to discover where regulation occurs: is it in the PP or the
      lamina propria? Intriguing results from Kronenberg and colleagues have shown that
      SCID mice reconstituted with CD45RBhi or CD45RBlo cells show no difference in the
      re-population of the gut prior to disease (ARANDA et al. 1997). The reason for
      colitis developing in those mice reconstituted with CD45RBhi cells is therefore
      more complex than merely differential re-population kinetics. No matter what the 
      outcome is, these and other related questions dealing with the induction and
      expression of mucosal T-cell responses are going to produce some surprises in the
      next few years.

TI  - Allergic colitis: a mimic of Hirschsprung disease.
PG  - 37-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: Allergy to cow milk protein is a common cause of gastrointestinal
      symptoms in infancy. Milk allergy is usually a clinical diagnosis, and thus there
      have been few reports of the radiographic findings. OBJECTIVE: To describe the
      barium enema findings of allergic colitis and differentiate them from
      Hirschsprung disease. Materials and methods. Four infants (age range 7 days-5
      weeks) with constipation underwent barium enema to exclude Hirschsprung disease. 
      Radiographic findings were correlated with the pathologic specimens from suction 
      rectal biopsy. RESULTS: All enemas revealed irregular narrowing of the rectum and
      a transition zone. Rectal biopsies in each case demonstrated ganglion cells and
      evidence of an allergic colitis, with inflammatory infiltrates in the lamina
      propria. A diagnosis of milk allergy colitis was made and symptoms resolved after
      removal of milk from the diet. CONCLUSIONS: Milk allergy is common in infancy.
      The rectum is a primary target organ, with allergic colitis often diagnosed on
      clinical grounds alone. However, a child with allergic colitis may be referred to
      radiology for barium enema, especially if constipation is present. The
      radiologist should be aware of the unique imaging findings of allergic colitis,
      so as to avoid confusion with Hirschsprung disease and perhaps an unnecessary
      rectal biopsy.
