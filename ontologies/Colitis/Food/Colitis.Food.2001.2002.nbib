TI  - [Allergic colitis: clinical and morphological aspects in infants with rectal
      bleeding].
PG  - 260-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies indicate the importance of eosinophilis infiltrated in
      the rectal mucous which jointly with the clinical features can serve to establish
      the diagnostic of allergic colitis. AIM: To describe prospectively, the clinical 
      features and morphological abnormalities of the rectal mucosa in patients with
      rectal bleeding and clinical diagnosis of cow's milk allergy. METHODS: Clinical
      features of 20 infants under 6 months of age were described. Morphological
      findings in rectal mucosa were compared with control group, with suspicion of
      congenital megacolon. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 97 +/- 47 days,
      rectal bleeding started before 120 days in 85% of them; 40% were breastfed, 60%
      cow's milk formula or both. The most striking morphological feature, in 18
      patients, was eosinophilic infiltration in the rectal mucosa. There was a
      significant statistical difference when these values were compared with control
      group. CONCLUSIONS: The increased number of eosinophils in the rectal mucosa
      represent the most important characteristic of allergic colitis, in patients
      under 6 months, with rectal bleeding, when breastfed, cow's milk formula or both.

TI  - Probiotics, infection and immunity.
PG  - 501-6
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Taking live bacteria by mouth to improve health (probiotics)
      is not intuitively rational yet it is a practice with a long history. As interest
      in the effects on health of the intestinal flora has developed, along with major 
      advances in the technology for studying it, so has come a new interest in
      establishing the true benefits of probiotic therapy. This review summarizes the
      most recent contributions to this rapidly developing area. RECENT FINDINGS:
      Probiotic bacteria, mainly bifidobacteria and lactobacilli for historical
      reasons, can prevent or ameliorate some diseases. Many empirical studies have
      been done, but work to develop the ideal characteristics of probiotics lags
      behind. Current literature covers survival of probiotics in the gut, mucosal
      adherence, antibacterial/pathogen mechanisms, effects on immune function and
      clinical studies. SUMMARY: Probiotic bacteria are effective in preventing and
      reducing the severity of acute diarrhoea in children. They are also useful in
      antibiotic associated diarrhoea but not for elimination of Helicobacter pylori.
      In inflammatory bowel disease, especially ulcerative colitis, probiotics offer a 
      safe alternative to current therapy. Probiotics have been used to prevent
      urogenital tract infection with benefit and, perhaps more intriguingly, to reduce
      atopy in children. Probiotics do not invariably work and study of mechanisms is
      urgently needed.

TI  - Intestinal microflora as a therapeutic target in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 73-7
AB  - Although the causes of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remain incompletely
      understood, increasing evidence implicates intestinal microflora in the
      pathogenesis of these disorders. Alteration of intestinal flora therefore may
      offer a plausible therapeutic approach. Although recent data support a potential 
      therapeutic role for probiotics and prebiotics in patients with IBD, such
      treatments need to be further assessed by large, double-blind controlled trials. 
      A better understanding of the intestinal microflora and the mechanisms of their
      action may help us to develop more effective treatment for IBD.

TI  - Treatment of ulcerative colitis by feeding with germinated barley foodstuff:
      first report of a multicenter open control trial.
PG  - 67-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: Germinated barley foodstuff (GBF) is a prebiotic foodstuff that
      effectively increases luminal butyrate production by stimulating the growth of
      protective bacteria. In the first pilot study, GBF has been shown to reduce both 
      clinical activity and mucosal inflammation in ulcerative colitis (UC). The aim of
      this study was to investigate the efficacy of GBF in the treatment of UC in a
      multicenter open control trial. METHODS: Eighteen patients with mildly to
      moderately active UC were divided into two groups using a random allocation
      protocol. The control group (n = 7) were given a baseline anti-inflammatory
      therapy for 4 weeks. In the GBF-treated group (n = 11), patients received 20-30 g
      GBF daily, together with the baseline treatment, for 4 weeks. The response to the
      treatments was evaluated clinically and endoscopically. Fecal microflora were
      also analyzed. RESULTS: After 4 weeks of observation, the GBF-treated group
      showed a significant decrease in clinical activity index scores compared with the
      control group (P < 0.05). No side effects related to GBF were observed. GBF
      therapy increased fecal concentrations of Bifidobacterium and Eubacterium
      limosum. CONCLUSIONS: Oral GBF therapy may have the potency to reduce clinical
      activity of UC. We believe that these results support the use of GBF
      administration as a new adjunct therapy for UC.

PG  - 196-9
AB  - The food-induced eosinophilic proctocolitis is a major cause of blood-tinged
      stools and appears in the first two months of life. The infant is generally
      described as well, but the clinical features and laboratory results are often
      nonspecific. We present an early infant with fresh blood stools at 50 days. The
      colonoscopy and biopsy of the rectum and lower sigmoid revealed lymphoid nodular 
      hyperplasia of the submucose and eosinophil infiltration (40 to 50 per high power
      field) of the lamina propria and intraepithelial. Elimination of the offending
      protein from the diet, through the use of an extensively hydrolyzed casein-based 
      formula and soy, lead to clinical resolution of bleeding at 48 hours. We made a
      review of the case.

TI  - [Diet therapy in chronic inflammatory bowel disease: results from meta-analysis
      and randomized controlled trials].
PG  - 2041-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic inflammatory bowel
      diseases of unknown etiology. Unspecific immunosuppressive therapy represents
      current standard treatment and is often associated with severe side effects.
      Several treatment regimens have been evaluated to identify alternative
      therapeutic options. Among these different diet therapies were investigated.
      Objective of this paper is to review the results of diet therapy in chronic
      inflammatory bowel disease on the basis of randomised controlled trials and
      meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. METHODS: Medline and Cochrane
      Library were searched for meta-analysis and randomised controlled trials
      investigating this question. Additionally reference lists of identified articles 
      and text books were checked for further trials. RESULTS: Four meta-analyses
      investigated the treatment of acute Crohn's disease with elemental-,
      semi-elemental-, and polymeric diets in comparison to corticosteroids or to
      another form of enteral diet. All meta-analyses show a superiority of
      corticosteroids and no difference in the effect of the compared enteral diets.
      Randomised controlled trials investigating diet therapy in ulcerative colitis
      have not been summarised in a meta-analysis yet. Eleven randomised trials were
      identified which evaluated diets in ulcerative colitis patients: Dietary
      supplementation with n-3-fatty acids (6 trials), elemental diet [2], dietary
      supplementation with dietary fiber [1], elimination diet [1], and dietary
      supplementation with olestra [1]. Only for the elimination diet a significant
      positive effect on the course of disease was found in one trial which
      investigated only 18 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Enteral nutritional therapy of acute 
      Crohn's disease is less effective than treatment with corticosteroids. In case of
      severe steroid induced side effects diet treatment can present a promising
      alternative. Superiority of one of the investigated different formulations was
      not found. Meta-analyses of randomised trials provide a clear and easy to
      understand presentation of the effect of this intervention. Eleven published
      trials investigating the effect of diets in ulcerative colitis show only for
      elimination diet a positive treatment effect. The trials do find a positive
      effect of one of the other interventions but the trials are very small and cannot
      exclude a treatment effect. Meta-analysis of these trials would be helpful for a 
      better presentation and understanding of these results.

TI  - Gastrointestinal manifestations of cow's milk allergy.
PG  - 65-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review and discuss the relationship between cow's milk allergy
      (CMA) and some gastrointestinal manifestations, such as gastroesophageal reflux, 
      constipation, food protein-induced enterocolitis, and food-induced eosinophilic
      proctocolitis, with respect to diagnostic strategies that might eliminate the
      need for a double-blind, placebo-controlled oral food challenge (DBPCFC). DATA
      SOURCES: A review of pertinent PubMed articles, published during the past 10
      years, was performed. STUDY SELECTION: To obtain positive and negative predictive
      values known as posterior probabilities and to calculate the likelihood ratio,
      only those studies including both patients and control subjects were selected for
      analysis. RESULTS: With respect to gastroesophageal reflux, a typical 24-hour
      esophageal pH monitoring pattern might obviate the performance of a DBPCFC in
      patients with symptoms of reflux suspected of having CMA, provided this pH
      pattern is confirmed in other studies. A relationship between CMA and
      constipation has been reported in only one prospective controlled study; the
      clinical and laboratory variables of perianal lesions, histologic abnormalities, 
      and signs of hypersensitivity had likelihood ratios of 2.2, 2.4, and 3.7,
      respectively, and posttest probabilities of 83, 84, and 88%, respectively.
      Therefore, a DBPCFC is warranted. In reference to food protein-induced
      enterocolitis, clinical and laboratory criteria suggested in the literature for
      defining a food challenge as positive have not been prospectively evaluated in
      the untreated state. Some simple stool tests, such as fecal tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha and alpha1-antitrypsin determination, might be candidates for
      diagnostic studies in patients with food protein-induced enterocolitis, if
      prospectively evaluated. In infants with food-induced eosinophilic proctocolitis,
      rectal biopsy invariably shows eosinophilic infiltration and thus makes
      performance of a DBPCFC unnecessary. CONCLUSION: Although the current diagnosis
      of gastrointestinal manifestations of CMA usually depends on a DBPCFC,
      investigators continue to study other options for confirming the diagnosis.

TI  - Mucosal immunity--basic principles, ontogeny, cystic fibrosis and mucosal
      vaccination.
PG  - 83-95
AB  - The mucosal immune system is an integral part of the whole-body immune system,
      however its regulation, maturation and function are to a great degree
      independent. Mucosal lymphoid tissue is the largest immune organ of the body,
      that stands in the first line of defence against foreign invaders. The goal of
      the immune system is immunity, however immunologic unresponsiveness (tolerance)
      is a key feature of the mucosal immune system, because the organism must tolerate
      thousands of ingested and inhaled harmless food and bacterial antigens. The
      phenomenon of oral tolerance is the unique feature of the mucosal immune system. 
      If abrogated, severe autoimmune diseases like Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis
      or coeliac sprue can develop. The quality of mucosal immune responses during
      newborn and infant age strongly influences the immune reactivity later in life.
      The most important factors influencing the development of mucosal immune
      reactivity are the feeding practices and microbial colonization. Manipulation of 
      the mucosal immune system offers interesting possibilities to prevent infection
      as well as autoimmune diseases directly in the affected tissue, without
      participation of the whole-body immune system. In this review we present the most
      recent basic information about the mechanisms of mucosal immunity, ontogeny of
      mucosal immunity, mucosal tolerance and immunisation and the role of mucosal
      immunity in an inherited disease in which the main battlefield is the lung
      mucosa-cystic fibrosis.

TI  - Probiotics up-regulate MUC-2 mucin gene expression in a Caco-2 cell-culture
      model.
PG  - 586-90
AB  - Enteral probiotics such as Lactobacillus casei GG (LGG) have been used in the
      treatment of a variety of intestinal disorders in infants and children, including
      diarrhea, malabsorption, and Clostridium difficile colitis. Previous studies have
      identified the gene locus for mucin (MUC-2) and its expression in Caco-2 cells.
      Others have demonstrated that mucin, located on the surface of the intestinal
      epithelium, inhibits bacterial translocation (BT). We previously demonstrated
      that both mucin and the probiotic bacterium LGG have an inhibitory effect on BT
      in both an in-vitro Caco-2 cell model and a neonatal rabbit model. We
      hypothesized that the decline in BT by LGG is mediated by up-regulation of
      epithelial MUC-2. Human enterocyte Caco-2 cells were grown to confluence and
      incubated at 37 degrees C with either medium (control group) or 10(4) or 10(8)
      LGG for 180 min. Non-adherent LGG was washed away. Caco-2 cells were then lysed, 
      purified, and quantified for MUC-2 protein and mRNA. The addition of LGG to the
      enterocyte monolayer surface resulted in significantly ( P < 0.05) increased
      MUC-2 expression compared to the untreated monolayers. Protein densities for
      MUC-2 significantly ( P < 0.05) increased with LGG. Density (expressed as ratio
      to control group) was 8.6 +/- 1.3 in the low-dose group (10(4) LGG) and 15.6 +/- 
      2.3 in the high-dose group (10(8) LGG). LGG may thus bind to specific receptor
      sites on the enterocyte and stimulate the up-regulation of MUC-2, resulting in
      increased inhibition of BT.

TI  - Identification of a novel fimbrial gene cluster related to long polar fimbriae in
      locus of enterocyte effacement-negative strains of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia 
      coli.
PG  - 6761-9
AB  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is a food-borne cause of bloody
      diarrhea and the hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) in humans. Most strains of EHEC 
      belong to a group of bacterial pathogens that cause distinctive lesions on the
      host intestine termed attaching-and-effacing (A/E) lesions. A/E strains of EHEC, 
      including the predominant serotype, O157:H7, are responsible for the majority of 
      HUS outbreaks worldwide. However, several serotypes of EHEC are not A/E pathogens
      because they lack the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island. 
      Nevertheless, such strains have been associated with sporadic cases and small
      outbreaks of hemorrhagic colitis and HUS. Of these LEE-negative organisms,
      O113:H21 is one of the most commonly isolated EHEC serotypes in many regions.
      Clinical isolates of LEE-negative EHEC typically express Shiga toxin 2 and carry 
      an approximately 90-kb plasmid that encodes EHEC hemolysin, but in the absence of
      LEE, little is known about the way in which these pathogens colonize the host
      intestine. In this study we describe the identification of a novel fimbrial gene 
      cluster related to long polar fimbriae in EHEC O113:H21. This chromosomal region 
      comprises four open reading frames, lpfA to lfpD, and has the same location in
      the EHEC O113:H21 genome as O island 154 in the prototype EHEC O157:H7 strain,
      EDL933. In a survey of EHEC of other serotypes, homologues of lpfA(O113) were
      found in 26 of 28 LEE-negative and 8 of 11 non-O157:H7 LEE-positive EHEC strains.
      Deletion of the putative major fimbrial subunit gene, lpfA, from EHEC O113:H21
      resulted in decreased adherence of this strain to epithelial cells, suggesting
      that lpf(O113) may function as an adhesin in LEE-negative isolates of EHEC.

TI  - Total N-nitroso compounds and their precursors in hot dogs and in the
      gastrointestinal tract and feces of rats and mice: possible etiologic agents for 
      colon cancer.
PG  - 3526S-3529S
LID - 10.1093/jn/132.11.3526S [doi]
AB  - We review evidence that red and processed meat are causes of colon cancer and
      that processed meat is a risk factor for childhood cancer and type 2 diabetes.
      Associations could be due to N-nitroso compounds (NOCs) derived from nitrosation 
      of NOC precursors (NOCPs). We review our survey of total NOC and NOCP content of 
      foods. Only rapidly nitrosated amines, including a glycosyl amino acid, were
      efficiently determined as NOCPs. NOCPs in hot dogs and rat feces were partly
      purified by adsorption-desorption and HPLC. After nitrosation, purified hot dog
      fractions were directly mutagenic in Ames test. The main NOCPs in these materials
      may be N-glycosyl amino acids and peptides. NOC levels in rat gastrointestinal
      tract rose steadily from stomach to feces. NOCP levels showed similar trend but
      with sharp increases from stomach to duodenum. One day after Min and C57BL/6J
      mice were fed 4% dextran sulfate sodium to induce acute colitis, fecal NOC levels
      increased 1.9-fold compared with untreated mice (P < 0.05). For 7 d Swiss mice
      received semipurified diet, 180 g beef-pork hot dogs mixed with 820 g diet or 180
      g sauteed beef mixed with 820 g diet. Fecal NOC outputs on day 7 were 3.7-5.0
      (hot dog) and 2.0-2.9 (beef) times those for control groups (P < 0.002 for
      combined groups), perhaps reflecting higher dietary NOC intakes. Feeding a
      similar hot dog mixture to mice did not affect normal 7-methyldeoxyguanosine
      level in colonic mucosal DNA. Overall, results support the hypothesis that
      colonic NOCs are a cause of colon cancer.

TI  - Dietary fiber down-regulates colonic tumor necrosis factor alpha and nitric oxide
      production in trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced colitic rats.
PG  - 3263-71
AB  - Previous studies have revealed the beneficial effects exerted by dietary fiber in
      human inflammatory bowel disease, which were associated with an increased
      production of SCFA in distal colon. The aim of the present study was to elucidate
      the probable mechanisms involved in the beneficial effects of a
      fiber-supplemented diet (5% Plantago ovata seeds) in the trinitrobenzenesulfonic 
      acid (TNBS) model of rat colitis, with special attention to its effects on the
      production of some of the mediators involved in the inflammatory response, such
      as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and nitric oxide (NO). Rats were fed
      the fiber-supplemented diet for 2 wk before TNBS colitis induction and thereafter
      until colonic evaluation 1 wk later. The results obtained showed that dietary
      fiber supplementation facilitated recovery from intestinal insult as evidenced
      both histologically, by a preservation of intestinal cytoarchitecture, and
      biochemically, by a significant reduction in colonic myeloperoxidase activity and
      by restoration of colonic glutathione levels. This intestinal anti-inflammatory
      effect was associated with lower TNFalpha levels and lower NO synthase activity
      in the inflamed colon, showing significant differences when compared with
      nontreated colitic rats. Moreover, the intestinal contents from fiber-treated
      colitic rats showed a significantly higher production of SCFA, mainly butyrate
      and propionate. We conclude that the increased production of these SCFA may
      contribute to recovery of damaged colonic mucosa because they constitute
      substrates for the colonocyte and, additionally, that they can inhibit the
      production of proinflammatory mediators, such as TNFalpha and NO.

TI  - Probiotics in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.
PG  - S78-80
AB  - Antibiotic-associated diarrhoea is a common event. In some cases, it could
      represent a life-threatening event. Clostridium difficile colitis is a further
      distinct complication of antibiotic administration. Treatment options for
      antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and Clostridium difficile colitis include
      supplementation with several types of probiotics, as overviewed in this paper.
      Three randomised, double-blind, controlled clinical trials show a therapeutic
      effect of Saccharomyces boulardii in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. The
      efficacy of Lactobacillus acidophilus and bulgaricus has also been ascertained in
      two double-blind controlled studies. Other studies focusing on Lactobacillus as a
      new preventive agent for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea are not double-blind.
      Among these, a positive effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Bifidobacterium
      longum and Enterococcus faecium SF68 has been reported. Effectiveness of
      probiotics in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea has, therefore, a consistent
      scientific rationale, however few studies have performed an assessment of
      bacterial recovery in stools, and this approach may be helpful in deciding a more
      rigorous dose standardisation.

TI  - Probiotics--role in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - S58-62
AB  - The aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease is still unclean. Whilst a specific
      pathogen agent associated with these diseases has not been found, the rationale
      for probiotic therapy in inflammatory bowel disease is based on convincing
      evidence involving intestinal bacteria in their pathogenesis. Encouraging results
      have been obtained with probiotic therapy in several animal models of
      experimental colitis. The administration of highly concentrated probiotic
      preparations represents a valid approach both for the prevention of pouchitis
      onset and relapses. The encouraging results obtained in ulcerative colitis and
      Crohn's disease need to be further assessed in large double-blind trials.

TI  - Cytoskeletal proteins and resident flora.
PG  - S34-6
AB  - Recent observations demonstrate that enteropathogenetic and enterohaemorrhagic
      bacteria, as well as other non enteropathogenetic bacteria (Listeria, Coxiella
      Burnetii), may subvert the host cell cytoskeleton. Models from enteropathogenic
      bacteria demonstrate that cytoskeletal proteins are required for bacteria binding
      to the enterocytes and that they play a role in the immune response of the host
      to intestinal bacteria. The cytoskeletal protein family Tropomyosins is present
      in all eukaryotic cells, with multiple isoforms regulated by multiple genes. Of
      the different Tropomyosin isoforms, TM5 has been shown to be expressed in colonic
      and jejunal epithelial cells, while TM1 in colonic and jejunal smooth muscle. In 
      vitro studies have shown the presence of serum and mucosal IgG against TM5 in
      almost two thirds of patients with ulcerative colitis, suggesting: a. a possible 
      autoimmune response to Tropomyosin in these patients; b. the hypothesis that the 
      development of pouchitis may be related to the expression of TM5 in the ileal
      pouch; c. the use of probiotics in the treatment of pouchitis. Overall, the new
      expression of cytoskeletal proteins on the cell surface appears to be possibly
      induced by several mechanisms, including intestinal bacteria and apoptosis. The
      expression of cytoskeletal proteins on the cell surface may induce tolerance or
      autoimmune response on target cells. Further investigations are, however needed
      on the possible role of cytoskeletal proteins in human diseases.

AB  - A series of gastro-intestinal diseases exhibits some connection with various
      cutaneous lesions. Some skin manifestations are clinically or histologically
      evocative, while others lack specificity. These manifestations can occur in overt
      digestive disease or be the clue for a silent one. A careful skin examination can
      thus reveal some inflammatory or neoplastic diseases of the gastro-intestinal
      tract, a malabsorption syndrome or food intolerance.

TI  - Gastrointestinal melatonin: localization, function, and clinical relevance.
PG  - 2336-48
AB  - The gastrointestinal tract of vertebrate species is a rich source of extrapineal 
      melatonin. The concentration of melatonin in the gastrointestinal tissues
      surpasses blood levels by 10-100 times and there is at least 400x more melatonin 
      in the gastrointestinal tract than in the pineal gland. The gastrointestinal
      tract contributes significantly to circulating concentrations of melatonin,
      especially during the daytime and melatonin may serve as an endocrine, paracrine,
      or autocrine hormone influencing the regeneration and function of epithelium,
      enhancing the immune system of the gut, and reducing the tone of gastrointestinal
      muscles. As binding sites for melatonin exhibit circadian variation in various
      species, it has been hypothesized that some melatonin found in the
      gastrointestinal tract might be of pineal origin. Unlike the photoperiodically
      regulated production of melatonin in the pineal, the release of gastrointestinal 
      melatonin seems to be related to the periodicity of food intake.
      Phylogenetically, melatonin and its binding sites were detected in the
      gastrointestinal tract of lower vertebrates, birds, and mammals. Melatonin was
      found also in large quantities in the embryonic tissue of the mammalian and avian
      gastrointestinal tract. Food intake and, paradoxically, also longterm food
      deprivation resulted in an increase of tissue and plasma concentrations of
      melatonin. Melatonin release may have a direct effect on many gastrointestinal
      tissues but may also well influence the digestive tract indirectly, via the
      central nervous system and the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. Melatonin 
      prevents ulcerations of gastrointestinal mucosa by an antioxidant action,
      reduction of secretion of hydrochloric acid, stimulation of the immune system,
      fostering epithelial regeneration, and increasing microcirculation. Because of
      its unique properties, melatonin could be considered for prevention or treatment 
      of colorectal cancer, ulcerative colitis, gastric ulcers, irritable bowel
      syndrome, and childhood colic.

TI  - Colon mucosal pathology in infants under three months of age with diarrhea
      disorders.
PG  - 387-90
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diarrhea is a common disease in infants. It may result in
      catastrophic events, especially in early infancy. Sometimes it is difficult to
      point out the diagnosis after initial examination. Sigmoidoscopy with mucosal
      biopsy may help in assessing the nature of the disease. The goals of this study
      are to evaluate the colon mucosal pathology in young infants with unknown
      diarrhea disorders and the clinical courses of different etiologies. METHODS: We 
      performed a retrospective analysis of 64 young infants (Mean +/- SD: 1.68 +/-
      1.01 months) in whom a diagnosis of unknown diarrhea disorder had been made after
      an initial investigation. All infants received fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy and
      mucosal biopsy with consent obtained. RESULTS: The appearance of the colon mucosa
      under endoscopy were: 36 (56.2%) showing edema, 30 (46.8%) showing nodularity, 23
      (35.9%) patients with focal erythema and friable mucosa, 11 (17.1%) showed
      erosion, 7 (10.9%) patients showing hemorrhage, and negative finding in one
      patient (1.6%). Colon mucosa pathologic findings were established: 40 (62.5%) had
      eosinophilic colitis (EC) and 19 (29.7%) had nonspecific colitis. The biopsies
      were normal in 5 cases; 81.5%(22/27) of patients with EC showed eosinophils in
      the stool smear which was significantly higher ( = 0.04) compared to the group II
      (9/17); 34 of 40 EC patients responded rapidly to changes in formula. CONCLUSION:
      Sigmoidoscopy and mucosal biopsy may be useful in the pathologic diagnosis of
      unknown diarrhea disorders. Eosinophilic colitis accounts for over half of very
      young infants with diarrhea disorders suggesting for allergic etiology. Patients 
      with allergic colitis may exhibit a dramatic response to elimination of the
      offending proteins from the diet.

TI  - N-3 fatty acids for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 391-5
AB  - The aim of the present paper is to briefly review the literature relating to
      clinical studies of the use of polyunsaturated long-chain fatty acids in the
      treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis and
      Crohn's disease. The reasons for the discrepancies in the findings could be
      related to the different study designs, different treatments, overlapping of
      treatment effects, as well as the variety of treatment formulations and doses
      used, which have led to results that are, in certain instances, very difficult to
      explain. Emphasis on a treatment formulation which reduces the incidence of side 
      effects, together with careful selection of patients and experimental design,
      seems to be associated with benefits, and these studies point to the therapeutic 
      potential for these lipids in the therapy of IBD. It is possible that these fatty
      acids act by reducing low-grade active inflammation rather than by preventing
      reinitiation of the inflammatory process from a truly quiescent state. Whether
      this treatment is applicable to all IBD patients has not been fully elucidated.
      Nevertheless, taken together, all these studies suggest the effectiveness of
      these new therapeutic approaches, not only when conventional treatment fails or
      when it is not possible to treat chronically, but also, in some instances, as
      first choice.

TI  - Probiotics as modulators of the gut flora.
PG  - S39-49
AB  - Probiotic ingestion can be recommended as a preventative approach to maintaining 
      the balance of the intestinal microflora and thereby enhance 'well-being'.
      Research into the use of probiotic intervention in specific illnesses and
      disorders has identified certain patient populations that may benefit from the
      approach. Undoubtedly, probiotics will vary in their efficacy and it may not be
      the case that the same results occur with all species. Those that prove most
      efficient will likely be strains that are robust enough to survive the harsh
      physico-chemical conditions present in the gastrointestinal tract. This includes 
      gastric acid, bile secretions and competition with the resident microflora. A
      survey of the literature indicates positive results in over fifty human trials,
      with prevention/treatment of infections the most frequently reported output. In
      theory, increased levels of probiotics may induce a 'barrier' influence against
      common pathogens. Mechanisms of effect are likely to include the excretion of
      acids (lactate, acetate), competition for nutrients and gut receptor sites,
      immunomodulation and the formation of specific antimicrobial agents. As such,
      persons susceptible to diarrhoeal infections may benefit greatly from probiotic
      intake. On a more chronic basis, it has been suggested that some probiotics can
      help maintain remission in the inflammatory conditions, ulcerative colitis and
      pouchitis. They have also been suggested to repress enzymes responsible for
      genotoxin formation. Moreover, studies have suggested that probiotics are as
      effective as anti-spasmodic drugs in the alleviation of irritable bowel syndrome.
      The approach of modulating the gut flora for improved health has much relevance
      for the management of those with acute and chronic gut disorders. Other target
      groups could include those susceptible to nosocomial infections, as well as the
      elderly, who have an altered microflora, with a decreased number of beneficial
      microbial species. For the future, it is imperative that mechanistic interactions
      involved in probiotic supplementation be identified. Moreover, the survival
      issues associated with their establishment in the competitive gut ecosystem
      should be addressed. Here, the use of prebiotics in association with useful
      probiotics may be a worthwhile approach. A prebiotic is a dietary carbohydrate
      selectively metabolised by probiotics. Combinations of probiotics and prebiotics 
      are known as synbiotics.

TI  - Probiotics and inflammatory bowel disease: from fads and fantasy to facts and
      future.
PG  - S5-9
AB  - Probiotic therapy is attracting the renewed interest of clinicians and basic
      investigators from a variety of traditional research disciplines. While the
      theoretical rationale for modifying the commensal flora of the gastrointestinal
      tract in specific circumstances appears sound and requires scientific pursuit,
      the field of probiotics has been clouded by exaggerated claims from some
      quarters. In general, many of the claims for therapeutic efficacy have not been
      well substantiated, but the field is now poised for evaluation within the realm
      of evidence-based medicine. Alterations in commensal bacterial flora within the
      gastrointestinal tract are associated with susceptibility to pathogens such as
      Clostridium difficile and there is persuasive evidence that the normal flora may 
      participate in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease and other chronic
      diseases in genetically susceptible individuals. This has prompted various
      strategies to fortify or otherwise modify the enteric flora by dietary
      supplements containing probiotic formulations. Detailed comparisons of probiotic 
      performance amongst different bacterial strains have not been performed in vivo
      in man or under clinical trial conditions, and the level of scientific
      characterisation of individual organisms has been variable. In addition, it
      cannot be assumed that the same probiotic is equally suitable for all
      individuals. Moreover, the heterogeneity of clinical disorders such as Crohn's
      disease and ulcerative colitis implies that strain-specific properties may be
      required for subset-specific categories of patients. While cocktails of
      probiotics offer convenience, therapeutic progress may require clarification of
      the mechanism of probiotic action and may be delayed until individual bacterial
      components have been rigorously studied. More importantly, the full potential of 
      therapeutic manipulation of the enteric flora with probiotics or other strategies
      may not be optimally realised until the composition and metabolic activities of
      the normal flora are better understood.

TI  - Response of intestinal epithelial cells to Trichuris suis excretory-secretory
      products and the influence on Campylobacter jejuni invasion under in vitro
      conditions.
PG  - 738-45
AB  - We previously developed a swine animal model in which natural host resistance to 
      Campylobacter jejuni is altered by experimental infection with low numbers of the
      nematode Trichuris suis. Pigs naturally colonized with C. jejuni experience
      colitis because of the invasion of the bacterium approximately 21 days after
      exposure to T. suis. To better understand the mechanism of T. suis-dependent C.
      jejuni colitis, we evaluated the effects of T. suis excretory-secretory products 
      (ESPs) on intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and the influence of ESP on C.
      jejuni invasion in IECs under in vitro conditions. Viability assays revealed a
      dose-dependent cytotoxic response in ESP-treated IECs, particularly IPEC-1 and
      INT407 cells. Transepithelial electrical resistance dropped significantly in
      IPEC-1 cells treated on apical and basolateral surfaces, but not in those treated
      only on apical surfaces. Using the gentamicin-killing assay, reduced numbers of
      intracellular C. jejuni were recovered from IECs treated with ESP at 1 mg
      protein/ml concentration. This observation can be at least partially explained by
      a novel antibacterial activity in ESP. Contrary to our hypothesis, ESP at
      subtoxic concentrations did not enhance invasion. In addition to mechanical
      damage from worms, these results suggest that soluble products released by T.
      suis contribute to IEC damage at the site of worm attachment.

TI  - Eosinophilic gastroenteritis: epidemiology, diagnosis and management.
PG  - 563-70
AB  - Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is a heterogeneous and uncommon disorder
      characterized by eosinophilic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tissues. The
      location and depth of infiltration determine its varied manifestations, and the
      latter is also the basis for the proposed classification into mucosal, muscular
      and serosal eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea 
      are each present in nearly 50% of the patients, with some overlap. Peripheral
      eosinophilia is seen in approximately two-thirds of patients with eosinophilic
      gastroenteritis. It is now clear that eotaxin, a specific eosinophil
      chemoattractant, plays a pivotal role in the process of eosinophil production.
      The differential diagnosis of eosinophilic gastroenteritis in children includes
      parasitic infections, inflammatory bowel disease, connective tissue diseases,
      some malignancies and adverse effects of drugs. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis
      itself has been strongly associated with food allergies, and concomitant atopic
      diseases or a family history of allergies is elicited in about 70% of cases. The 
      pediatric experience is unique with respect to recognition of distinctive
      entities such as allergic procto-colitis, almost exclusively seen in infants, and
      eosinophilic esophagitis being increasingly reported among children and young
      adults. The gold standard for diagnosis, usually demonstrated on endoscopic
      biopsies, is prominent tissue eosinophilia. However, the diagnosis may be
      obscured by the patchy nature of the disease, and muscular and serosal
      eosinophilic gastroenteritis subtypes. In the latter cases, full thickness
      biopsies would be indicated for a definitive diagnosis. There are many reports of
      successful treatment of eosinophilic gastroenteritis in children, using a variety
      of treatment regimens including elimination diets. Corticosteroids remain the
      most effective agents for controlling symptoms, but unfortunately the relapsing
      nature of the disease would mandate prolonged corticosteroid use. Reports of
      favorable responses to new leukotriene inhibitors in patients with eosinophilic
      gastroenteritis are encouraging; these responses should stimulate future research
      on the pathophysiology and management of eosinophilic gastroenteritis.

TI  - A new prebiotic from germinated barley for nutraceutical treatment of ulcerative 
      colitis.
PG  - 818-24
AB  - A germinated barley foodstuff (GBF) containing glutamine-rich protein and
      hemicellulose-rich fiber was made from brewer's spent grain, by physical
      isolation. Our previous studies demonstrated that GBF supported maintenance of
      epithelial cell populations, facilitated epithelial repair, and suppressed
      epithelial nuclear factor kappaB-DNA-binding activity through generating
      increased short-chain fatty acid (especially butyrate) production by luminal
      microflora, which includes Bifidobacterium and Eubacterium, thereby preventing
      experimental colonic injury. The fiber fraction also modulates stool water
      content because of its high water-holding capacity. The patients with mild to
      moderate active ulcerative colitis who had been unresponsive to or intolerant of 
      standard treatment received 20-30 g GBF, feeding daily in a non-randomized,
      open-label fashion. At 4 weeks, this treatment resulted in a significant clinical
      and endoscopic improvement. The improvement was associated with an increase in
      stool butyrate concentrations. These results indicate that GBF feeding is a
      potentially new, attractive prebiotic treatment in patients with ulcerative
      colitis. The potency of GBF on modulating microflora, as well as the high
      water-holding capacity, may play an important role in treatment and prolongation 
      of remission in ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Anti-inflammatory effects of enteral diet components on Crohn's disease-affected 
      tissues in vitro.
PG  - 430-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The mechanism of action of elemental diet in Crohn's disease
      treatment, is unknown. Alteration of bacterial flora, low antigenicity, low fat
      content and improvement of nutritional status are postulated to play a role in
      the anti-inflammatory effect of elemental diet. AIM: To determine whether
      elemental diet or its modifications has a direct anti-inflammatory effect on
      colonic tissue biopsies in vitro. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Colonic or ileal biopsies
      from 39 patients with inflammatory bowel disease and control patients were
      incubated for 24 hours with enteral diets in which nitrogen sources were amino
      acids as in elemental diet, casein or whey. Tissues were incubated with elemental
      diet, casein or whey, at dilutions of 1:5, 1:10 or 1:20 in Waymouth's complete
      medium; a medium control was also included. Tissue viability was assessed by
      bromodeoxyuridine uptake. Interleukin-1beta, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist
      and interleukin-10 concentrations in supernatants were measured by immunoassay
      (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). RESULTS: Incubation of tissues from Crohn's 
      disease with elemental diet resulted in an increase in the ratio of interleukin-1
      receptor antagonist/interleukin-1beta vs control statistically significant at
      1:10 (89.6+/-17 vs 45.7+/-9. 1, p<0.05). Incubation of Crohn's tissue with casein
      resulted in a significant increase of interleukin-1 receptor
      antagonist/interleukin-1beta ratio at dilutions 1:20, 1:10 and 1:5 (101.8+/-22.0,
      p=0.05, 142.8+/-24.6, p<0.05; 109.7+/-25.0, p=0.05). In ulcerative colitis tissue
      and non-inflamed non-inflammatory bowel disease control tissue, no significant
      increase in interleukin 1 receptor antagonist/interleukin-1beta ratio was seen
      after incubation with elemental diet, casein and whey. CONCLUSION: Elemental diet
      incubation increases anti-inflammatory:proinflammatory cytokine ratio in Crohn's 
      disease and this anti-inflammatory effect is not specifically due to amino acid
      composition, as diets containing casein have similar anti-inflammatory effects.

AB  - Significant advances have been made regarding our understanding of the
      etiopathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. This review focuses on the most
      recent applications of medical therapy for ulcerative colitis. Therapeutic
      approaches continue to evolve regarding inductive and maintenance strategies with
      oral and topical aminosalicylates, systemic and non-systemic corticosteroids, and
      cyclosporine and alternative immunomodulators. As further investigations continue
      to discern microbiological and immunoinflammatory targets, future therapies may
      include both probiotics and novel biological agents.

TI  - Vibrio vulnificus infection in patients with liver disease: report of five
      autopsy cases.
PG  - 88-92
AB  - Five autopsy cases of Vibrio vulnificus infection with liver disease are
      reported. All five patients ate raw seafood 24 h before the onset of illness. The
      clinical presentation was of primary septicemia, with positive cultures in both
      the blood and cutaneous lesions. Stool cultures were positive for the organism in
      one patient with gastrointestinal symptoms. Autopsy examination revealed liver
      cirrhosis in three cases and alcoholic liver disease in two; all showed portal
      hypertension. Gastrointestinal mucosal changes were seen in four patients: edema,
      hemorrhagic necrosis, and lymphocyte infiltration. One case was of an human
      immunodeficiency virus infected patient in which histology showed a rare
      intestinal disease, phlegmonous colitis. We believe this is the first description
      of a case of concomitant phlegmonous enterocolitis and V. vulnificus infection.
      Patients with liver disease should be warned about the possibility of
      life-threatening infections and complications associated with the consumption of 
      raw seafood.

TI  - Different molecular events account for butyrate-induced apoptosis in two human
      colon cancer cell lines.
PG  - 1812-8
AB  - We studied the molecular events underlying butyrate-induced apoptosis in two
      different colon cancer cell lines: Caco-2, a well defined cancer cell and RSB, a 
      cell line obtained from a colonic tumor of an ulcerative colitis patient. Caco-2 
      and RSB cells were exposed to 2, 5 and 10 mmol/L butyrate for 48 h. Caspase-1 was
      cleaved in Caco-2-cells at all butyrate concentrations, whereas in RSB-cells
      caspase-1 expression was undetectable. In RSB cells, butyrate dose-dependently
      induced caspase-3 cleavage, whereas in Caco-2-cells, butyrate up-regulated
      expression of the caspase-3 active subunit. Caspase-3-specific activity,
      cytoplasmic nucleosome concentration and growth were directly correlated with
      butyrate doses in both cell lines; however, the response was more pronounced in
      Caco-2 than in RSB cells. Expression of the cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
      (PARP) product was elevated in both cell lines at the highest butyrate
      concentration. Bak expression gradually increased as a function of butyrate
      concentrations in both cell lines. At 10 mmol/L butyrate, expression increased by
      fivefold and sevenfold in Caco-2 and RSB cells, respectively. The highest
      expression of Bcl-2 was observed in control Caco-2 cells, and expression
      decreased with increasing butyrate concentration. This effect was not observed in
      RSB cells. Inactivation of caspase-1 with Z-YVAD-FMK abrogated butyrate-induced
      apoptosis in Caco-2 but not in RSB cells. Inactivation of caspase-3 with
      Z-DVED-FMK completely inhibited butyrate-induced apoptosis in RSB cells whereas
      this effect was less pronounced in Caco-2 cells. Our data demonstrate that
      butyrate-induced apoptosis is activated via different apoptotic pathways in
      diversely stratified colon cancers.

AB  - Since 1996, we have been analyzing DNA pattern of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia
      coli(EHEC) O157: H7 isolates in Japan by the use of pulsed-field gel
      electrophoresis. The method, capable of discriminating genotypical difference of 
      the isolates, enabled us to find the contaminated food such as salmon roe which
      was the causative agent for the multiprefectual outbreaks in Japan. These
      outbreaks which we are referring as diffuse outbreaks seem to be increasing in
      number, because it reflects that some of widely distributed or mass-produced food
      products are being contaminated by pathogens such as EHEC. In order to find a
      diffuse outbreak promptly and prevent it becoming large, we are constructing a
      network, called PulseNet Japan, for sharing the results of pulsed-field gel
      electrophoresis and epidemiological information among municipal public health
      institutes and National Institute of Infectious Diseases.

TI  - Modification of enteral diets in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 457-61
AB  - The provision of food is thought to promote the maintenance of gut integrity.
      Nutrients are able to elicit and affect both systemic and mucosal immune
      responses. Enteral diet therapy has long been known to be efficacious in
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly in childhood Crohn's disease.
      However, the mechanisms of action of these diets are not clear. Nutritional
      repletion, direct effects on the gut mucosa or decreased intestinal permeability 
      have all been postulated as being important in nutritional therapy. There is some
      evidence that the enteral diet has a direct effect on the gut mucosa by reducing 
      cytokine production and the accompanying inflammation, thus leading to decreased 
      intestinal permeability. Modifications of enteral diet composition have been
      evaluated in many studies. Such modifications include fat and/or protein content 
      and the addition of bioactive peptides. The fatty acid composition of the enteral
      diet seems to have a much greater impact on its efficacy than modification of the
      N source. As specific fatty acids are precursors of inflammatory mediators
      derived from arachidonic acid, the reduction in these components may be
      beneficial in nutritional therapy for IBD. Addition of bioactive peptides to
      enteral diet formulas may also have a role; such peptides may have specific
      growth factor or anti-inflammatory actions. There is still much work to be done
      to define disease-specific enteral diet formulas that are effective as therapies 
      for both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

TI  - A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of essential fatty acid
      supplementation in the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1131-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Essential fatty acid supplementation has been found to ameliorate
      certain chronic inflammatory diseases. This effect is thought to be mediated
      through the modulation of eicosanoid synthesis. Pro-inflammatory eicosanoids have
      been implicated in ulcerative colitis. AIM: To investigate the possible
      therapeutic benefit of essential fatty acids in quiescent ulcerative colitis to
      reduce the frequency of disease relapse. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study was performed with a treatment duration of 12 months.
      Patients with quiescent disease received either trial medication (gamma-linolenic
      acid, 1.6 g, eicosapentaenoic acid, 270 mg, and docosahexaenoic acid, 45 mg, per 
      day) or placebo (sunflower oil, 500 mg/day). The primary end-point was disease
      activity, assessed by a previously validated clinical index, sigmoidoscopic
      appearance and histology. RESULTS: Sixty-three patients were randomized, 31 to
      receive essential fatty acid treatment and 32 to receive placebo. Disease relapse
      rates were similar at 12 months (placebo, 38%; essential fatty acids, 55%), as
      were changes in sigmoidoscopic grade from baseline. CONCLUSIONS: The
      supplementation of the diet with this combination of essential fatty acids does
      not prolong the period of disease remission of ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Physiological small bowel malabsorption of carbohydrates protects against large
      bowel diseases in Africans.
PG  - 249-52
AB  - In African black people there is a paucity of 'developed society' large bowel
      diseases such as diverticular disease, colorectal adenomas and carcinomas,
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Appendicitis has an incidence of about
      5-10% of the number likely to be observed in a white population. The conundrum is
      that the disparity exists despite many Africans having adopted an urbanized
      lifestyle with major changes in their dietary pattern. Dietary fiber intake,
      which was previously 30-35 g, has decreased to 12-14 g daily. Studies on small
      bowel function in black people have shown that physiological malabsorption of
      lactose, fructose, sucrose and maize (the staple food) occurs. It is hypothesized
      that the increased concentration of substrate available for fermentation in the
      colon compensates for the low dietary fiber intake, is protective to the large
      bowel and is a factor in the prevention of 'developed society' large bowel
      diseases in the African population.

TI  - Lymphonodular hyperplasia of the terminal ileum associated with colitis shows an 
      increase gammadelta+ t-cell density in children.
PG  - 667-72
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recently we reported a close association between lymphonodular
      hyperplasia (LNH) of the bulb of the duodenum and increased densities of
      intraepithelial gammadelta+ T-cells in subjects with untreated food allergies. In
      this study we sought to determine whether children with LNH of the terminal ileum
      (TI) show a similar correlation. METHODS: The mucosal specimens taken by
      colonoscopy from the TIs of 22 children with LNH of the TI without colitis, 13
      with right-sided colitis or pancolitis, nine with left-sided colitis, eight with 
      Crohn's disease, and three endoscopically healthy subjects were studied for
      T-cell subsets with monoclonal antibodies using a three-layer peroxidase staining
      method. RESULTS: LNH of the TI was found in 32 of the 55 subjects (58%). In 22 it
      was the only endoscopic finding, but in nine of 13 subjects (69%) it was related 
      to right-sided colitis or pancolitis. In patients with left-sided colitis or
      Crohn's disease it was diagnosed only rarely. In the whole study population, LNH 
      of the of the TI showed a significant association with the increment in the
      density of gammadelta+ T-cells. The subjects with LNH of the TI and colitis
      starting from the cecum showed the highest values, discriminating them
      statistically from any other study group. Accordingly their gammadelta+/CD3+
      ratio was high. Even in the subjects with LNH of the TI without colitis, the
      increment in gammadelta+ T-cells was significant as compared with the subjects
      with left-sided colitis. Upregulations of D-related expression on the mucosa of
      the TI were similar regardless of the presence of LNH or colitis or an increment 
      in gammadelta+ T-cells. CONCLUSION: Our preliminary observations showed increased
      densities of intraepithelial gammadelta+ T-cells and elevated gammadelta+/CD3+
      ratios in subjects with LNH on the mucosa of the TI, especially if related to
      colitis starting at the cecem, but not in subjects with typical left-sided
      colitis or granulomatous Crohn's disease. The study also provides further
      evidence suggesting the significance of food-borne antigens in the pathogenetic
      mechanism of right-sided colitis or pancolitis. The finding also indicates the
      significance of classifying colitis into gammadelta-positive and -negative
      diseases, and has implications for the treatment of these entities.

TI  - [Shiga toxin producing Escherichia coli infection].
PG  - 545-50
AB  - Shiga toxin producing Escherichia coli(STEC) has been recognized as an emerging
      food-borne pathogen that causes bloody diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis and
      hemolytic uremic syndrome(HUS), especially in developed countries. As the
      specific therapy for STEC infection has not been developed, currently available
      medical therapy is inadequate to prevent life-threatening complications. Here are
      described the possibilities and problems of using and developing therapies such
      as antibiotics, Synsorb-Pk and humanized anti-Stx monoclonal antibody therapy. In
      conclusion, the prevention of primary infection is thought to be the best way to 
      prevent the life-threatening complications caused by STEC, and second way is
      identification as early as possible.

TI  - [Probiotics in gastroenterology].
PG  - 197-201
AB  - Probiotics are defined as live microorganisms of human origin. Their use may
      favorably influence human health and ameliorate or prevent certain diseases.
      Prebiotics are non-digestible foodstuffs (fiber, oligofructans - "colonic
      foods"), which enter the colon and are metabolized by the probiotics. Probiotics 
      should fulfill the following criteria: Phenotypic and genotypic classification,
      no pathogenic properties, human origin, application in the living state,
      resistance to gastric acid and bile, ability to adhere to colonocytes, ability to
      colonize the gut, clinically proved favorable health-effect, and safety.
      Experimental and clinical studies supplied evidence of the possible use of
      probiotics in the following diseases: Traveler's diarrhea, antibiotic-associated 
      diarrhea, relapsing Clostridium difficile colitis, infantile diarrhea, rotavirus 
      enteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, colon cancer,
      peritonitis, acute pancreatitis, and diarrhea associated with HIV infection.
      Probiotics displayed the following effects in these studies: Involvement in
      production of essential nutrients of the colonic mucosa, beneficial effect on
      intestinal immunity, recovery of the disturbed gut mucosal barrier and prevention
      of microbial translocation, elimination of toxins and eradication of microbial
      pathogens, production of steroids from cholesterol and reduction of its pool in
      circulation, participation in regulation of intestinal functions, reduced
      incidence of chemically induced colon tumors in rodents. Probiotics open new
      therapeutic modalities in a number of diseases and it may be expected that their 
      importance will increase with growing knowledge and experience.

TI  - Dietary protein enterocolitis.
PG  - 76-9
AB  - Dietary protein enterocolitis generally presents in the 1st year of life with
      diarrhea, emesis, and irritability. When there is a delay in diagnosis,
      persistent exposure to the offending dietary antigen leads to increasing enteric 
      inflammation manifesting as bloody diarrhea, anemia, dehydration, and failure to 
      sustain normal patterns of weight gain and growth. The extent of enteric
      inflammation may be limited to mild proctitis, pancolitis, or true enterocolitis 
      with esophagitis, gastritis, enteropathy, and colitis. The offending antigen is
      usually cow's milk protein or soy protein. A significant number of the infants
      are exclusively breast fed, especially those with proctitis. In older children, a
      wide variety of dietary proteins have been implicated. The inconsistency between 
      allergists and gastroenterologists in the clinical definition of the syndrome
      remains a significant problem. To the allergist, the definition is based on
      clinical criteria, allergy testing, and response to double-blind food challenge, 
      whereas to the gastroenterologist, it is defined by histologic criteria and the
      response of clinical and histologic manifestations to elimination diets. To
      further complicate the issue, European studies have emphasized the alterations in
      enteric permeability noted in both enteropathy and enterocolitis. In an effort to
      establish a unified approach, the International Life Sciences Institute sponsored
      a workshop in late 1998, which resulted in a document entitled "Classification of
      Gastrointestinal Disease of Infants and Children Due to Adverse Immunologic
      Reactions."

TI  - Complementary practitioners' views of treatment for inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 95-100
AB  - A substantial number of patients with inflammatory bowel disease use
      complementary therapies to manage their disease, including chiropractic and
      herbal therapies. The objective of this study was to explore whether providers of
      these therapies see patients with inflammatory bowel disease and recommend
      therapies, and to determine their opinions about the treatments that they
      recommend. The study sample comprised 66 chiropractors, 19 pharmacists, 16
      herbalists and 15 health food store employees in Calgary, Alberta. A structured
      questionnaire containing two patient scenarios (a patient with active ulcerative 
      colitis and a patient with inactive Crohn's disease) was completed either by an
      in-person interview or by a mailed questionnaire. Most respondents had seen
      patients with ulcerative colitis, and at least 80% of each group except
      pharmacists (only 10%) would treat these patients or recommend treatment. Almost 
      all chiropractors used spinal manipulation, whereas herbalists and health food
      store employees suggested a wide range of different treatments. Chiropractors
      rated their treatment as moderately effective; herbalists and health food store
      employees viewed their recommendations as very effective. The results with
      respect to the second scenario were very similar. The wide range of treatment
      recommendations by practitioners, who differ greatly in terms of skills,
      knowledge and experience, has important implications for physician-patient
      communication, information provision and education regarding complementary and
      alternative therapies.

TI  - [Nutrition in chronic inflammatory bowl diseases. What your patient tolerates is 
      permitted].
PG  - 40-3
AB  - Modifying the diet can have a favorable impact on the course of chronic
      inflammatory bowel disease. In contrast, nutrition plays no major role in the
      development of the disease or in provoking an acute attack. During an acute
      attack of Crohn's disease, the application of oral (drinks) or tube feeding
      (enteral nutrition) can result in a substantial clinical improvement. The
      remission rate of this side effect-free therapy is, however, lower than that seen
      with steroids. The data available for diet therapy in ulcerative colitis are less
      unequivocal, but the effects are probably slight at best. During the remission
      phase, the patient should eat a balanced, vitamin-rich and varied normal diet
      that excludes all poorly tolerated foods: lactose intolerance in particular
      appears to be increased in patients with Crohn's disease. Known vitamin or
      mineral deficiencies should be corrected by appropriate dietary measures or
      supplementation. There is no such thing as a "Crohn's diet" or "colitis diet".
      The patient can be allowed to eat anything that is tolerated.

TI  - [The Munchausen syndrome: a diagnosis not to be forgotten in urology].
PG  - 119-21
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Among the manifestations of Munchausen's syndrome, "neurological"
      forms may exist. OBSERVATION: We present the case of a patient presenting with
      urinary retention following treatment for urinary incontinence. The patient had
      injected himself with infected urine collected from his catheter, in order to
      create septicemia. COMMENTS: Nephritic colitis, false gall stones, addition of
      fecal matter or of food and saliva in the urine or the bladder, neurogenic
      bladder and urinary infections have all been reported as possible manifestations 
      of Munchausen's syndrome. Diagnosis of this syndrome is often delayed and
      laborious, after repeated hospitalisations, examinations and often aggressive
      treatment. Its therapeutic management is difficult. Patients, despite proof, deny
      their deceit and refuse psychiatric care.

TI  - Cow's milk protein intolerance and chronic constipation in children.
PG  - 339-42
AB  - Cow's milk protein (CMP) allergy was investigated in 25 children (age-range 3
      months to 11 years) with chronic constipation. A diagnosis of constipation was
      made on the basis of a history of painful elimination of hard stools for at least
      1 month, whether or not associated with a reduced frequency of stools or soiling.
      The children were evaluated using clinical parameters and the following
      laboratory tests: total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE); specific IgE
      (radioallergosorbent test [RAST]) for whole cow's milk, alpha-lactoalbumin,
      beta-lactoglobulin, and a food group; and skin-prick tests with whole milk,
      alpha-lactoalbumin, beta-lactoglobulin, and casein. Following the evaluation, the
      children were submitted to a CMP-free diet for a period of 4 weeks. In seven
      patients (28%), constipation disappeared during the CMP-free diet and reappeared 
      within 48-72 h following challenge with cow's milk. In two infants a rectal
      biopsy revealed allergic colitis and they therefore did not undergo the
      challenge. High serum levels of total IgE were observed in five of the children
      who showed a clinical improvement (71%), a positive skin-test in two (29%), and
      detectable specific IgE in two (29%). These results suggest that CMP allergy or
      intolerance should be considered as a cause of chronic refractory constipation in
      children, although the underlying mechanism still require further investigation.

TI  - Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies, 
      and specific IgE to food allergens in children with inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 162-8
AB  - Differential diagnosis between ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD)
      is difficult in the initial phases in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel 
      diseases (IBD). This study was performed to determine the significance of
      anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae
      antibodies (ASCA) in IBD. ANCA were specified with regard to their antigenic
      specifity, significance to the diagnosis, and correlation of titer with the
      disease activity. The occurrence of food allergy was questioned, too. Serum
      samples from 44 children with UC (n = 23) or CD (n = 21) and from disease-control
      children (coeliac disease, n = 21) were analyzed for IgG ANCA, ANCA target
      antigens, IgA and IgG ASCA, and IgE to food allergens. Results show that ANCA
      occur more frequently in UC than in CD and disease-control (74, 24, and 10%,
      respectively). The presence of ANCA does not reflect disease activity. Antigenic 
      specificity does not differ in any group. IgA-ASCA are found more often in
      patients with CD (76% versus 17% in UC). The testing for both ANCA and ASCA
      enabled clear-cut differential diagnosis between UC and CD based on the high
      specificity (ANCA+ ASCA- 92.5% for UC, ANCA- ASCA+ 93.2% for CD). Specific IgE to
      food allergens were found in 8.7, 14.3, and 23.8% of patients with UC, CD, and
      coeliac disease, respectively. We conclude that combined testing of ANCA and ASCA
      represents a valuable tool in the differential diagnosis between UC and CD in
      pediatric patients, minimizing invasive diagnostic procedures. Monitoring of
      ANCA, its specificity, and titer determination does not bring more information.
      Testing for specific IgE to food allergens may be considered in individual
      patients.

TI  - Biological actions and therapeutic potential of the glucagon-like peptides.
PG  - 531-44
AB  - The glucagon-like peptides (GLP-1 and GLP-2) are proglucagon-derived peptides
      cosecreted from gut endocrine cells in response to nutrient ingestion. GLP-1 acts
      as an incretin to lower blood glucose via stimulation of insulin secretion from
      islet beta cells. GLP-1 also exerts actions independent of insulin secretion,
      including inhibition of gastric emptying and acid secretion, reduction in food
      ingestion and glucagon secretion, and stimulation of beta-cell proliferation.
      Administration of GLP-1 lowers blood glucose and reduces food intake in human
      subjects with type 2 diabetes. GLP-2 promotes nutrient absorption via expansion
      of the mucosal epithelium by stimulation of crypt cell proliferation and
      inhibition of apoptosis in the small intestine. GLP-2 also reduces epithelial
      permeability, and decreases meal-stimulated gastric acid secretion and
      gastrointestinal motility. Administration of GLP-2 in the setting of experimental
      intestinal injury is associated with reduced epithelial damage, decreased
      bacterial infection, and decreased mortality or gut injury in rodents with
      chemically induced enteritis, vascular-ischemia reperfusion injury, and dextran
      sulfate-induced colitis. GLP-2 also attenuates chemotherapy-induced mucositis via
      inhibition of drug-induced apoptosis in the small and large bowel. GLP-2 improves
      intestinal adaptation and nutrient absorption in rats after major small bowel
      resection, and in humans with short bowel syndrome. The actions of GLP-2 are
      mediated by a distinct GLP-2 receptor expressed on subsets of enteric nerves and 
      enteroendocrine cells in the stomach and small and large intestine. The
      beneficial actions of GLP-1 and GLP-2 in preclinical and clinical studies of
      diabetes and intestinal disease, respectively, has fostered interest in the
      potential therapeutic use of these gut peptides. Nevertheless, the actions of the
      glucagon-like peptides are limited in duration by enzymatic inactivation via
      cleavage at the N-terminal penultimate alanine by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DP
      IV). Hence, inhibitors of DP IV activity, or DP IV-resistant glucagon-like
      peptide analogues, may be alternative therapeutic approaches for treatment of
      human diseases.

TI  - The use of probiotics in gastrointestinal disease.
PG  - 817-22
AB  - Probiotics are living microorganisms that can affect the host in a beneficial
      manner. Prebiotics are nondigestible food ingredients that stimulate the growth
      and activity of probiotic bacteria already established in the colon. Efficacy of 
      probiotic compounds has been shown in a wide range of gastrointestinal diseases. 
      Lactobacillus GG alone, or the combination of Bifidobacterium bifidum and
      Streptococcus thermophilus, is effective in the treatment of Clostridium
      difficile, as well as in preventing the frequency and severity of infectious
      acute diarrhea in children. Prevention of antibiotic-induced diarrhea with the
      concomitant administration of either Lactobacillus GG or Saccharomyces boulardii 
      has been demonstrated. The most successful studies involve the use of
      Lactobacillus GG at a dose of 1 x 1010 viable organisms per day and the yeast
      boulardii at a dose of 1 g/day. A probiotic preparation (VSL#3 - 6 g/day) that
      uses a combination of three species of Bifidobacterium, four strains of
      Lactobacillus and one strain of Streptocccus has shown promise in maintaining
      remission in ulcerative colitis and pouchitis, as well as in preventing the
      postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease. The mechanism of action of
      probiotics may include receptor competition, effects on mucin secretion or
      probiotic immunomodulation of gut-associated lymphoid tissue. Oral administration
      of probiotic compounds has been demonstrated to be well tolerated and safe.
      However, while probiotics have the potential to improve human health and to
      prevent and treat some diseases, major improvements are needed in labelling and
      quality assurance procedures for probiotic compounds. In addition, well planned
      and controlled clinical studies are necessary to delineate fully the potential
      for probiotic compounds.

TI  - Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of Escherichia coli verotoxin-producing
      isolates from humans and pigs.
PG  - 1904-11
AB  - The aim of this study was to characterize verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli
      (VTEC) isolates obtained from humans and pigs in the same geographic areas and
      during the same period of time in order to determine whether porcine VTEC
      isolates could be related to human cases of diarrhea and also to detect the
      presence of virulence factors in these isolates. From 1,352 human and 620 porcine
      fecal samples, 11 human and 18 porcine verotoxin-positive isolates were obtained 
      by the VT immunoblot or the individual colony testing technique. In addition, 52 
      porcine VTEC strains isolated from diseased pigs at the Faculte de medecine
      veterinaire during the same period or from fecal samples collected previously
      isolated at slaughterhouses were characterized in this study. Antimicrobial
      resistance profiles were different between human and porcine isolates. In
      general, the serotypes observed in the two groups were different. No porcine
      isolate was of serotype O157:H7; however, one isolate was O91:NM, a serotype that
      has been associated with hemorrhagic colitis in humans. Also, one serotype
      (O8:H19) was found in isolates from both species; however, the O8:H19 isolates of
      the two groups were of different pathotypes. The pathotypes observed in the human
      and porcine isolates were different, with the exception of VT2vx-positive
      isolates; the serotypes of these isolates from the two groups were nevertheless
      different. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis indicated no relatedness
      between the human and porcine isolates. In conclusion, these results suggest that
      the porcine and human isolates of the present study were not genetically related.
      Most porcine VTEC isolates did not possess known virulence factors required to
      infect humans. However, certain non-O157:H7 porcine VTECs may potentially infect 
      humans.

TI  - The bacterial flora in inflammatory bowel disease: current insights in
      pathogenesis and the influence of antibiotics and probiotics.
PG  - 29-40
AB  - The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains unknown, although in
      recent years more data have become available. The contribution of genetic and
      environmental factors is evident, and the luminal bacterial flora plays a major
      role in the initiation and perpetuation of chronic IBD. Animal models of IBD have
      shown that colitis does not occur in a germ-free environment. In human IBD,
      inflammation is present in parts of the gut containing the highest bacterial
      concentrations. Moreover, the terminal ileum, caecum and rectum are areas of
      relative stasis, providing prolonged mucosal contact with luminal contents.
      Enhanced mucosal permeability may play a pivotal role in maintaining a chronic
      inflammatory state, due to a genetic predisposition or as a result of direct
      contact with bacteria or their products. A detective epithelial barrier may cause
      a loss of tolerance to the normal enteric flora. Furthermore, an increased
      mucosal absorption of viable bacteria and bacterial products is found in IBD.
      Serum and secreted antibodies are increased and mucosal T-lymphocytes that
      recognize luminal bacteria are present. However, there is evidence that the
      immune system reacts over aggressively towards the normal luminal flora rather
      than the flora being altered in IBD. Several approaches have been used in
      attempts to discover a specific microbial agent in the cause of IBD. These
      include demonstration of the presence of organisms or specific antigens in
      affected tissues, culture of microbes firm the affected tissues, demonstration of
      serological responses to several agents, and localization and detection of
      individual pathogen-specific nucleic acid sequences in affected tissue by in situ
      hybridization and polymerase chain reaction. So far, no specific micro-organism
      has been directly associated with the pathogenesis of IBD. Analysis of the
      luminal enteric flora, however, has revealed differences in the composition of
      this flora compared to healthy controls. In Crohn disease, concentrations of
      Bacteroides, Eubacteria and Peptostreptococcus are increased, whereas
      Bifidobacteria numbers are significantly reduced. Furthermore, in ulcerative
      colitis, concentrations of facultative anaerobic bacteria are increased. The
      arrival of new molecular techniques qualifying and quantifying the complex
      intestinal flora has induced a revival of interest in this microflora.
      Therapeutic approaches geared towards changing the environment at the mucosal
      border have been attempted by the use of elemental diets, total parenteral
      nutrition, surgical diversion of the faecal stream and antibiotics. Over the past
      few years, the use of probiotics in IBD and other intestinal disorders has gained
      attention. Strengthened by promising experimental data and commercial interests, 
      research in this field is rapidly expanding. Manipulation of the colonic bacteria
      with antibiotic drugs and probiotic agents may prove to be more effective and
      better tolerated than immunosuppressants in the future.

TI  - Reduced plasma antioxidant concentrations and increased oxidative DNA damage in
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1289-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress is believed to play a key role in the pathogenesis
      of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-related intestinal damage. Circulating
      antioxidants may have a role to play in preventing free radical-mediated tissue
      injury. METHODS: Plasma vitamin A, E and carotenoid concentrations, leukocytic
      genomic damage and 8-hydroxy-deoxy-guanosine (8-OHdG) concentration were
      determined in 46 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, 37 Crohn disease (CD) patients
      and 386 controls. A 20 ml blood sample was taken from each subject for
      antioxidant and 8-OHdG measurements. A food frequency questionnaire was
      administered to a sample of subjects from each group to evaluate daily intake of 
      dietary compounds. RESULTS: Antioxidant concentration was significantly reduced
      in IBD patients, particularly in those with active disease, with respect to
      controls (P < 0.0001). 8-OHdG concentrations were significantly increased in IBD 
      patients compared to controls, independent of disease activity (P < 0.05). No
      correlation was found between antioxidant and 8-OHdG concentrations. Carotenoid
      concentrations were significantly reduced in malnourished IBD patients (0.89 +/- 
      0.14 micromol/l) compared to patients with normal or high body mass index (1.83
      +/- 0.12 micromol/l; P < 0.05), independent of disease activity or extension.
      Protein, fruit and vegetable intakes of IBD patients were significantly lower
      than those of controls. CONCLUSIONS: Depletion of antioxidants is likely to be
      important in the pathophysiology of IBD: UC and CD patients show increased free
      radical peripheral leukocyte DNA damage and decreased plasma antioxidant
      defenses. These results indicate the necessity of further studies to establish
      whether optimal vitamin status may improve the clinical course of UC and CD.

TI  - Lymphonodular hyperplasia on the mucosa of the lower gastrointestinal tract in
      children: an indication of enhanced immune response?
PG  - 42-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: To discover the prevalence and significance of lymphonodular
      hyperplasia (LNH) of the lower gastrointestinal tract, the authors did a
      retrospective analysis of a consecutive series of children using colonoscopy to
      evaluate persistent and severe gastrointestinal symptoms. The authors also sought
      to discover in more detail how often subjects with LNH of the terminal ileum (TI)
      or colon show an association with food allergy (FA). METHODS: The analysis
      included a consecutive series of 140 children evaluated at the Oulu University
      Hospital using colonoscopy, which extended to the TI in 74 of these children. A
      total of 102 patients underwent gastroduodenoscopy. The disease category was
      assessed using endoscopic, histopathologic, and clinical information. To diagnose
      FA, a masked or an open food challenge was administered to all patients who
      aroused any suspicion of food-related exacerbation of symptoms. RESULTS: Of 140
      patients, LNH of the colon was diagnosed in 46 subjects, 9 of 38 patients had
      colitis, 1 of 8 patients had Crohn disease, and 36 of the remaining 94 subjects
      did not have colitis. Twelve patients of the 22 with LNH of the colon (55%)
      showed concomitant LNH on the bulb of the duodenum. Lymphonodular hyperplasia of 
      the TI was diagnosed in 53 of the 74 subjects in whom TI could be visualized. It 
      was seen in most patients without colitis (80%), in one half the subjects with
      colitis (48%), and in one quarter of those with Crohn disease (25%). Among the
      whole study group 37 (26%) could be defined as having FA. It was more prevalent
      in patients with (52%) than in those without (13%) LNH of the colon ( P < 0.001).
      The presence of LNH in the TI also showed some association with FA ( P < 0.05),
      but less than did LNH of the colon. CONCLUSION: We consider LNH on the mucosa of 
      the colon or TI common but not an innocent bystander. Significantly related to a 
      diagnosis of gastrointestinal FA in this study, it is an expression of mucosal
      immune response. If detected on the colon, FA should be considered, whereas if
      present in TI, it may be related to FA but also to a variety of other
      immunologically active disease states.

TI  - Molecular evolution of the intimin gene in O111 clones of pathogenic Escherichia 
      coli.
PG  - 479-87
AB  - Intimin is an important virulence factor in two groups of enteric pathogens:
      enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), which is a major cause of infant
      diarrhea in the developing world, and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), which has
      caused large food-borne outbreaks of hemorrhagic colitis in the United States and
      other developed countries. Intimin is encoded on a 35-kb pathogenicity island
      called the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE). At least five antigenic types
      have been described for the highly variable gene, and each type is generally
      characteristic of particular evolutionary lineages. We determined the nucleotide 
      sequences of intimin and other LEE genes in two O111 clones that have not been
      amenable to typing. The sequences from both O111:H8 and O111:H9 differed from the
      Int-beta that is typical of other clones in the same evolutionary lineage. The
      sequence from the O111:H8 strains was a mosaic of divergent segments that
      alternately clustered with Int-alpha, Int-beta, or Int-gamma. The sequence from
      the O111:H9 clone consistently showed a close relationship with that from
      E2348/69, a distantly related strain that expresses Int-alpha. The results
      suggest that there have been multiple acquisitions of the LEE in the EHEC 2/EPEC 
      2 clonal lineage, with a recent turnover in either O111:H8 or its close
      relatives. Amino acid substitutions that alter residue charge occurred more
      frequently than would be expected under random substitution in the extracellular 
      domains of intimin, suggesting that diversifying selection has promoted
      divergence in this region of the protein. An N-terminal domain that presumably
      functions in the periplasm may also be under positive selection.

TI  - Antibody response to dietary and autoantigens in G alpha i2-deficient mice.
PG  - 1421-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mice with a targeted mutation in the G protein subunit G alpha i2
      gene develop a colonic mucosal inflammation, with a highly activated B-cell
      response. We wanted to investigate whether this increased B-cell activity was
      directed against dietary antigens and/or various self tissues. METHODS: The level
      of antibodies specific for dietary (gliadin, soya and fish meal) antigens was
      measured by ELISA. Reactivity against self antigens was measured by
      immunohistochemistry on cryo-sectioned mouse and rat tissue. Sera and intestinal 
      lavages were analysed from G alpha i2-/- mice before and after development of
      colitis and in age-matched wild type litter mates. RESULTS: Titres of antibodies 
      against dietary antigens were significantly enhanced both in serum and in large
      intestinal lavages from G alpha i2-/- mice with ongoing colitis but not prior to 
      disease, as compared to wild type mice. The autoreactivity to self tissues was
      significantly increased in G alpha i2-/- mice both before and after development
      of colitis as compared to litter mate control animals. Self tissue reactivity was
      directed not only against epithelial cells of the colon, small intestine and
      gastric glands, but also against smooth muscle cells, hepatocytes, bile duct
      cells, renal tubule and collecting tubule cells of the kidney. In analogy to
      human ulcerative colitis, autoantibodies against epithelial cells, bile duct
      epithelium and neutrophil granulocytes were found. CONCLUSIONS: Earlier increase 
      in levels of autoantibodies (before onset of colitis) than of food antibodies
      (after onset of colitis) suggests the latter response to be a secondary
      phenomenon to e.g. a destroyed barrier function.

TI  - Inhibitory activity of Bifidobacterium longum HY8001 against Vero cytotoxin of
      Escherichia coli O157:H7.
PG  - 1667-73
AB  - Vero cytotoxin (VT)-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC), such as E. coli O157:H7,
      are emerging foodborne pathogens worldwide. VTs are associated with hemorrhagic
      colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome in humans. Attachment of the B subunit of
      VTs to its receptor, globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), at gut epithelium is the
      primary step and, consequently, the A subunit of VTs inhibits protein synthesis
      in the target cell. Proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1beta, up-regulate Gb3 expression, increase
      sensitivity to VTs, and enhance VT action in developing disease. Currently, there
      is a growing interest in probiotics, given the increasing occurrence of
      antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In particular, much work on bifidobacteria among
      probiotics, regarded as microorganisms targeted for technological and therapeutic
      applications, has been performed. In Korea, the neutralizing effect of the
      culture supernatant of Bifidobacterium longum HY8001, Korean isolate, against the
      VTs from E. coli O157:H7 was found. Therefore, this study focused on the raveling
      of the inhibitory effect of B. longum HY8001 against VTs, through the
      interference B subunit of VTs and Gb3 interaction. Mice were inoculated
      intragastrically with B. longum HY8001 culture supernatant before and after
      challenge with E. coli O157:H7. Control mice were inoculated intragastrically
      only with E. coli O157:H7. Cytokine, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta levels in sera and
      expression of their mRNA were decreased, and expression of Gb3 in renal tubular
      epithelial cells was reduced in mice treated with B. longum HY8001 culture
      supernatant. In competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), the
      culture supernatant of B. longum HY8001 primarily binds VTs to interfere the VTs 
      with Gb3 interaction. These results suggest that soluble substance(s) in B.
      longum HY8001 culture supernatant may have inhibitory activity on the expression 
      of Gb3, VT-Gb3 interaction, or both. Further study should be done to elucidate
      the property of soluble substances in B. longum HY8001 culture supernatant.

TI  - Localization, physiological significance and possible clinical implication of
      gastrointestinal melatonin.
PG  - 350-66
AB  - The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is a major source of extrapineal melatonin. In
      some animals, tissue concentrations of melatonin in the GIT surpass blood levels 
      by 10-100 times and the digestive tract contributes significantly to melatonin
      concentrations in the peripheral blood, particularly during the day. Some
      melatonin found in the GIT may originate from the pineal gland, as the organs of 
      the digestive system contain binding sites, which in some species exhibit
      circadian variation. Unlike the production of pineal melatonin, which is under
      the photoperiodic control, release of GI melatonin seems to be related to
      periodicity of food intake. Melatonin and melatonin binding sites were localized 
      in all GI tissues of mammalian and avian embryos. Postnatally, melatonin was
      localized in the GIT of newborn mice and rats. Phylogenetically, melatonin and
      melatonin binding sites were detected in GIT of numerous mammals, birds and lower
      vertebrates. Melatonin is probably produced in the serotonin-rich
      enterochromaffin cells (EC) of the GI mucosa and can be released into the portal 
      vein postprandially. In addition, melatonin can act as an autocrine or a
      paracrine hormone affecting the function of GI epithelium, lymphatic tissues of
      the immune system and the smooth muscles of the digestive tube. Finally,
      melatonin may act as a luminal hormone, synchronizing the sequential digestive
      processes. Higher peripheral and tissue levels of melatonin were observed not
      only after food intake but also after a long-term food deprivation. Such
      melatonin release may have a direct effect on the various GI tissues but may also
      act indirectly via the CNS; such action might be mediated by sympathetic or
      parasympathetic nerves. Melatonin can protect GI mucosa from ulceration by its
      antioxidant action, stimulation of the immune system and by fostering
      microcirculation and epithelial regeneration. Melatonin may reduce the secretion 
      of pepsin and the hydrochloric acid and influence the activity of the myoelectric
      complexes of the gut via its action in the CNS. Tissue or blood levels of
      melatonin may serve as a marker of GI lesions or tumors. Clinically, melatonin
      has a potential for a prevention or treatment of colorectal cancer, ulcerative
      colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, children colic and diarrhea.

TI  - Nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 561-9
AB  - Nutritional derangements are frequent in inflammatory bowel disease. In the past 
      year significant work has been published examining the mechanisms of impaired
      food intake in animal models of inflammatory bowel disease, which allow a better 
      understanding of these processes. Data from the same laboratory have shed further
      light on the relative role of underfeeding and inflammation on the growth
      retardation associated with intestinal inflammation. Other studies have provided 
      further data on the risk factors and predictive biomarkers of bone loss in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The potential role of enteral nutrition
      as primary therapy for Crohn's disease is particularly addressed in this review. 
      Recent contributions to the field emphasized the special importance of this
      modality of therapy in paediatric patients. The possible mechanisms for such a
      therapeutic action are not well understood. Other nutrients may have a
      therapeutic potential in inflammatory bowel disease. In particular, recent data
      on the in-vivo anti-inflammatory actions of butyrate merit special mention.
      Finally, novel nutritional therapeutic strategies for inflammatory bowel disease,
      such as transforming growth factor-beta2-enriched enteral feeding, or
      hydrothermally processed cereals have recently been explored.

TI  - Review article: the immunoregulatory cytokine interleukin-10--a therapy for
      Crohn's disease?
PG  - 1709-16
AB  - The gastrointestinal tract serves as a barrier between the host and the vast
      array of foreign antigens that are contained within its lumen. The mucosal immune
      system must balance two opposing functions: to mount an immune response to
      pathogens, whilst maintaining tolerance to antigens derived from commensal
      bacteria and food. This balance is regulated by both cellular interactions and
      the release of soluble mediators called cytokines. Diseases such as ulcerative
      colitis and Crohn's disease are characterized by alterations in the balance of
      pro-inflammatory and regulatory cytokines. Interleukin-10 is a regulatory
      cytokine which inhibits both antigen presentation and subsequent pro-inflammatory
      cytokine release. In addition, there is evidence that it promotes the formation
      of antigen-specific regulatory T-cell clones. The pivotal role played by
      interleukin-10 within the mucosal immune system is demonstrated both by the
      chronic ileocolitis that develops in gene-targeted interleukin-10 knock-out mice,
      and by its therapeutic efficacy in several animal models of colitis. However,
      trials of daily systemic interleukin-10 administration in patients with Crohn's
      disease have reported only a modest clinical response. Advances in the analysis
      of functional polymorphisms in the interleukin-10 gene may allow therapy to be
      targeted to patients who will respond. Finally, therapeutic strategies utilizing 
      gene therapy may enhance mucosal delivery and increase therapeutic response.

TI  - Delayed puberty and response to testosterone in a rat model of colitis.
PG  - R1483-91
AB  - Delayed puberty is a frequent complication of inflammatory bowel disease. The
      precise etiological mechanisms are not known. In this study, we wanted to
      determine the relative contribution of undernutrition and inflammation to delayed
      puberty and the effect of inflammation on the reproductive axis. Puberty was
      assessed in rats with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid induced-colitis, healthy
      controls, and animals pair fed to match the food intake of the colitic group. The
      response to testosterone administration was assessed in colitic rats. We found
      that induction of colitis was associated with hypophagia and reduced weight gain,
      and undernutrition in healthy females (i.e., pair fed) resulted in a delay in the
      onset (by 4.8 days, P < 0.001) and progression of puberty (normal estrous cycles 
      in 42%, P = 0.04) compared with controls. However, puberty was further delayed in
      the colitic group (1.4 days after pair fed) with the absence of normal estrous
      cycling in all rats. In males, the onset of puberty was also delayed, and weights
      of accessory sex organs were reduced compared with pair-fed controls. Plasma
      testosterone concentrations were low, and gonadotropin concentrations were normal
      in colitic rats. Testosterone treatment normalized puberty in male rats with
      colitis. In conclusion, in rats with experimental colitis, inflammation appears
      to potentiate the effect of undernutrition on puberty. The weights of secondary
      sex organs and the onset of puberty were normalized by testosterone treatment.

TI  - Current status of human parasitic infections in Taiwan.
PG  - 155-60
AB  - The eradication of the 2 mosquito-borne parasitic diseases, malaria and lymphatic
      filariasis, is one of the greatest achievements of the parasite control campaigns
      in Taiwan. Most of the soil-transmitted nematode infections, with the exception
      of pinworm infection, are currently well controlled and limited to some
      aboriginal areas. Food-borne parasitic zoonosis such as infections with
      Angiostrongylus cantonensis, Clonorchis sinensis, and Taenia saginata asiatica
      are not rare, but the former is seasonal and the latter 2 are ethnically and
      geographically associated. Intestinal protozoal infections with Giardia lamblia
      and Cryptosporidium parvum are at low levels but may be widely distributed.
      Opportunistic protozoal infections among patients with acquired immunodeficiency 
      syndrome, which included amebic colitis, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, and
      cerebral toxoplasmosis, are becoming increasingly important. The rapid increase
      in international travel and the introduction of large numbers of foreign workers 
      from other countries in Southeast Asia may change the epidemiological patterns of
      parasitic infections in Taiwan.

TI  - Viral causes of diarrhea.
PG  - 779-95
AB  - Viruses are important causes of diarrhea. In healthy adults, the main clinical
      manifestation is acute, self-limited gastroenteritis. Advances in molecular
      diagnostics have shown that epidemics of acute gastroenteritis most frequently
      are due to caliciviruses spread through contaminated food or through
      person-to-person contact. Application of similar technology is needed to make a
      definitive statement about the role of such candidate viruses as rotavirus,
      astrovirus, and adenovirus as the cause of nonepidemic acute gastroenteritis in
      adults. Rarely a previously healthy adult gets acute CMV colitis. CMV and EBV
      mainly cause diarrhea in immunocompromised patients, however. Advances in
      prophylaxis and treatment have reduced the frequency and severity of these
      diseases. Acute infantile gastroenteritis is caused by rotavirus, calcivirus,
      astrovirus, and adenovirus. These viral diseases of the gut are seen by the
      physician as routine and rare clinical problems.

TI  - [Metabolic disorders in nonspecific inflammatory bowel diseases].
PG  - 456-9
AB  - The primary function of the gastrointestinal system is to assist the intake and
      further processing of food and liquids. Besides that, it forms an anatomical
      barrier between the external environment and internal milieu. It is also highly
      important for its paracrine and endocrine function. Inflammatory bowel diseases, 
      which frequently cause a gastrointestinal failure, form a specific group. Most
      frequently it is the ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Impaired integrity
      of the gastrointestinal mucosa and failure of protective mechanisms lead to the
      increased permeability of the intestinal wall for antigens derived from food,
      saprophytic bacteria and pathogenic microorganisms. When the gastrointestinal
      failure is threatening, factors determining its residual function become more
      important. As decisive reveals the severity and location of the primary disease. 
      Previous surgeries and adaptation of the residual part of the gastrointestinal
      system are important, as well as the possibility of peroral or enteral nutrient
      intake. Depending on the presence of risk factors and the degree of residual gut 
      function, some complications can be expected: dehydration, mineral disorders,
      symptoms of protein and energy depletion, infection, and multiple organ
      dysfunction syndrome. It is highly important to decide whether the
      gastrointestinal system will be included into or excluded from the process of
      realimentation. Critically ill patients with inflammatory bowel diseases should
      be treated at an intensive care unit.

TI  - T cells of the colonic mucosa in patients with infantile colitis.
PG  - 133-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infantile colitis is a heterogeneous group of disorders, including
      enterocolitis complicating Hirschsprung disease, allergic colitis, inflammatory
      bowel disease, and Behcet syndrome. There are limited data concerning the immune 
      responses induced by the inflammation of the intestine in young infants. METHODS:
      Twenty-four colonic biopsy specimens from 12 infantile colitis patients and 12
      age-matched control patients were studied by immunohistologic methods. The
      authors compared the T cells, their subsets expressing the surface antigens CD8
      and CD4, and T-cell receptors alphabeta and deltagamma, and densities of
      mononuclear and epithelial cells expressing human leukocyte antigen class II
      antigens. RESULTS: The density of CD3+ intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) in the 
      large intestinal specimens was significantly higher (P = 0.036) in colitis
      patients than in the control group. The majority of the CD3+ IELs were
      CD8+-expressing cells, and only a minority were CD4+ cells in both groups. T-cell
      receptors alphabeta+ (P = 0.023) and deltagamma+ (P = 0.027) IELs were observed
      significantly more frequently in colitis patients than in the control group. In
      surface epithelium, delta non-disulphide-linked type T-cell receptor (deltaTCS1) 
      IELs were found strikingly more frequently (P = 0.001) in the specimens taken
      from the colitis patients. Also, the density of the deltaTCS1+ cells in crypts of
      the large intestine was significantly higher in colitis patients than in the
      control patients (P = 0.047). CONCLUSIONS: A significant increase of CD3+
      lymphocytes in the colonic epithelium of the patients with infantile colitis was 
      noted. This increase involved both T-cell receptor alphabeta-positive and
      deltagamma-positive IELs. The finding of this study supports the proposal that
      intraluminal antigens, either microbial or food derived, are important in the
      pathogenesis of colitis in young infants.

TI  - Molecular weight distribution of carrageenans studied by a combined gel
      permeation/inductively coupled plasma (GPC/ICP) method.
PG  - 763-72
AB  - Degraded carrageenan (known as poligeenan molecular weight: 20 kDa to 30 kDa)
      causes ulcerative colitis in experimental animals. In this paper, the molecular
      weight distributions of 29 samples of food-grade refined carrageenans were
      studied by high performance liquid gel permeation chromatography (GPC) directly
      connected to vacuum-ultraviolet inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission
      spectrometry (ICP) (GPC/ICP) as well as GPC/refractive index (RI) detection. All 
      samples of food-grade carrageenan had a major broad peak of high molecular weight
      which eluted at around 6.5 min in both RI and ICP mode (sulphur and carbon), and 
      each sample of them had no obvious peak of poligeenan (the detection limit was
      about 5%). The number average molecular weights of these carrageenans ranged from
      193 kDa to 324 kDa, and the weight average molecular weights ranged from 453 kDa 
      to 652 kDa based on RI data. Some samples had a few minor peaks which eluted
      around 10-12 min. These peaks came from ionic sulphate, sucrose or glucose. It
      was considered that if the data-sampling programme was improved, the GPC/ICP
      system would become a more powerful technique for evaluation of carrageenan
      samples containing ionic substances and sugar.

TI  - Probiotic bacteria enhance murine and human intestinal epithelial barrier
      function.
PG  - 580-91
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The probiotic compound, VSL#3, is efficacious as maintenance
      therapy in pouchitis and ulcerative colitis. The aim of this study was to
      determine the efficacy of VSL#3 as a primary therapy in the treatment of colitis 
      in the interleukin (IL)-10 gene-deficient mouse. Mechanisms of action of VSL#3
      were investigated in T(84) monolayers. METHODS: IL-10 gene-deficient and control 
      mice received 2.8 x 10(8) colony-forming units per day of VSL#3 for 4 weeks.
      Colons were removed and analyzed for cytokine production, epithelial barrier
      function, and inflammation. VSL#3 or conditioned media was applied directly to
      T(84) monolayers. RESULTS: Treatment of IL-10 gene-deficient mice with VSL#3
      resulted in normalization of colonic physiologic function and barrier integrity
      in conjunction with a reduction in mucosal secretion of tumor necrosis factor
      alpha and interferon gamma and an improvement in histologic disease. In vitro
      studies showed that epithelial barrier function and resistance to Salmonella
      invasion could be enhanced by exposure to a proteinaceous soluble factor secreted
      by the bacteria found in the VSL#3 compound. CONCLUSIONS: Oral administration of 
      VSL#3 was effective as primary therapy in IL-10 gene-deficient mice, and had a
      direct effect on epithelial barrier function.

TI  - Human colonic anti-secretory activity of the potent NK(1) antagonist, SR140333:
      assessment of potential anti-diarrhoeal activity in food allergy and inflammatory
      bowel disease.
PG  - 1346-54
AB  - 1. This in vitro study was designed to determine the potential use of the NK(1)
      antagonist, SR140333 as an anti-diarrhoeal treatment for food allergy or
      inflammatory bowel disease. The effect of various immune and neuronal stimuli on 
      human colonic substance P (SP) release and the effect of SR140333 on subsequently
      stimulated mucosal ion transport was investigated. 2. Submucosal and sensory
      nerve fibre stimulation using electrical field stimulation (1 ms/7 Hz/7 V) and
      capsaicin (50 microM) respectively, mast cell activation by anti-IgE (1/250
      dilution) and granulocyte stimulation using fMLP (50 microM) each released SP and
      evoked a secretory response. 3. SP and the NK(1) selective agonist, Sar-SP (0.1 -
      1000 nM) stimulated an increase in colonic secretion which was antagonized by
      SR140333 (pD'(2)=6.7 and 7.25 versus SP and Sar-SP respectively). 4. SR140333, at
      a concentration that blocked NK(1)-mediated secretion (500 nM), also reduced the 
      secretory response to both alphaIgE and capsaicin. This suggests a
      pathophysiologic role for NK(1) receptors. 5. Capsaicin evoked SP release was
      increased in tissue taken from Crohn's disease but not ulcerative colitis
      patients. The response to SP was however reduced by 70 and 89% respectively. 6.
      Mast cells and sensory afferents contribute to allergic diarrhoea. Since SR140333
      reduced the secretory response to mast cell and afferent stimulation this
      compound may be particularly useful in reducing the symptoms of food allergy.

TI  - Biological therapies for ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 205-9
AB  - Biological therapies are being increasingly investigated for the treatment of
      inflammatory bowel disease. However, a great deal more study has been devoted to 
      studies of Crohn's disease rather than ulcerative colitis. Ulcerative colitis,
      like Crohn's disease, represents an area of high clinical need, particularly for 
      those patients who have disease inadequately responsive to corticosteroids and
      5-aminosalicylates. The distinct anatomic distribution of inflammation in
      ulcerative colitis represents an important model for study, with the entire
      involved mucosa entirely accessible to endoscopy. In addition, there is an
      opportunity for local delivery of biologic agents in left-sided disease. Distinct
      pathogenetic factors in ulcerative colitis raise the possibility of therapies
      quite different from those used in Crohn's disease. This work describes the
      current state of knowledge regarding biological therapy in ulcerative colitis.
      The role of probiotic therapy, and studies of cytokine-directed therapies,
      therapies targeting adhesion and recruitment, and restitution and repair are
      described.

      current and future perspectives.
PG  - 1977-97
AB  - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are two idiopathic inflammatory disorders 
      of the GI tract. Manifestations of disease can be severe and lead to long term
      therapy with a variety of medications and/or surgery. Standard medical therapy
      consists of agents that either treat suppurative complications or modulate the
      inflammatory cascade in a nonspecific manner. Many specific chemokine and
      cytokine effectors that promote intestinal inflammation have been identified.
      Such work has led to experimental clinical trials with a variety of cytokine
      antagonists. Compounds directed against one such cytokine, tumor necrosis factor 
      alpha (TNF), have demonstrated the greatest clinical efficacy to date. This is
      consistent with scientific observations that suggest a central role for TNF in
      the inflammatory cascade. Infliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody against
      TNF that has been demonstrated to be effective for the treatment of Crohn's
      disease. Infliximab is Food and Drug Administration approved for the treatment of
      Crohn's disease. There exist several other TNF antagonists in various phases of
      investigation, including the monoclonal antibody CDP 571, the fusion peptide
      etanercept, the phosphodiesterase inhibitor oxpentifylline, and thalidomide. The 
      clinical efficacy of these agents and the role of TNF in the pathogenesis of
      inflammatory bowel disease is reviewed.

TI  - Treatment of gastrointestinal viruses.
PG  - 289-300; discussion 300-5
AB  - The most common enteric viruses responsible for diarrhoea are rotavirus, enteric 
      adenoviruses, caliciviruses including the Norwalk agent and astrovirus. These
      infections are usually mild to moderate in severity, self-limiting and of short
      duration and thus, specific antiviral therapy is not recommended. The standard
      management of these infections is restoration of fluid and electrolyte balance
      and then maintenance of hydration until the infection resolves. WHO oral
      rehydration therapy (ORT) was introduced about 30 years ago and has saved the
      lives of many infants and young children. During the last 10 years it has become 
      evident that the efficacy of ORT can be increased by reducing the osmolality of
      the WHO oral rehydration solution (ORS) to produce a relatively hypotonic
      solution. Hypotonic ORS appears to be safe and effective in all forms of acute
      diarrhoea in childhood. Complex substrate ORS, which is also usually hypotonic,
      has been shown to have increased efficacy in cholera but not in other bacterial
      or viral diarrhoeas. Nevertheless, the scientific rationale for using rice or
      resistant starch as substrate in ORS is of physiological interest. Other
      treatments such as hyperimmune bovine colostrum, probiotics and antiviral agents 
      are largely experimental and have not been introduced into routine clinical
      practice. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection of the gastrointestinal tract occurs
      mainly in the immunocompromised although it has been reported in immunocompetent 
      individuals. CMV infects both the oesophagus and colon to produce oesophagitis,
      often with discrete ulcers, and colitis, respectively. Both conditions can be
      treated with ganciclovir or foscarnet. Failure to respond to monotherapy is an
      indication to use both agents concurrently.

TI  - Isogenic strain of Escherichia coli O157:H7 that has lost both Shiga toxin 1 and 
      2 genes.
PG  - 711-7
AB  - An Escherichia coli O157:H7 strain isolated from a patient with hemorrhagic
      colitis was found to exhibit two slightly different colony morphology types on
      differential medium. Each morphological type, designated TT12A and TT12B, was
      isolated, and serological testing using various assays confirmed that both
      strains carried the O157 and the H7 antigens. Biochemical testing showed that the
      strains had identical profiles on AP120E analysis and, like typical O157:H7
      strains, did not ferment sorbitol or exhibit beta-glucuronidase activity.
      Analysis with a multiplex PCR assay showed that TT12B did not carry the gene for 
      either Shiga toxin 1 (Stx1) or Stx2, whereas these genes were present in TT12A
      and the toxins were produced. Apart from that, both strains carried the +93 gusA 
      mutation, the cluster I ehxA gene for enterohemolysin, and the eae gene for
      gamma-intimin, which are all characteristics of the O157:H7 serotype. Phenotypic 
      assays confirmed that both strains exhibited enterohemolysin activity and the
      attachment and effacing lesion on HeLa cells. Multilocus enzyme electrophoresis
      analysis showed that the strains are closely related genetically and belong in
      the same clonal group. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing of
      XbaI-digested genomic DNA revealed that the two strains differed by two bands but
      shared 90% similarity and clustered in the same clade. All other
      non-Stx-producing O157:H7 strains examined clustered in a major clade that was
      distinct from that of Stx-producing O157:H7 strains. The findings that TT12B was 
      identical to TT12A, except for Stx production, and its PFGE profile is also more 
      closely related to that of Stx-producing O157:H7 strains suggest that TT12B was
      derived from TT12A by the loss of both stx genes.

TI  - Effect of probiotics on enterocyte bacterial translocation in vitro.
PG  - 265-8
AB  - Enteral probiotics such as Lactobacillus casei GG (LGG) have been used in the
      treatment of a variety of intestinal disorders in infants and children, including
      diarrhea, malabsorption, and Clostridium difficile colitis. We have previously
      demonstrated that the probiotic bacterium LGG has an inhibitory effect on
      bacterial translocation (BT) in a neonatal rabbit model. However, this in-vivo
      model is limited for investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms
      responsible for probiotic inhibition of BT. The purpose of this study was to
      determine the efficacy of LGG in reducing the rate of Escherichia coli C25 (E.
      coli C25) translocation using an in-vitro enterocyte cell-culture model. Human
      colonic carcinoma (Caco-2) enterocytes were seeded in porous filters in the
      apical chamber of a two-chamber cell-culture system and grown for 14 days to
      confluence. The monolayers were incubated at 37 degrees C with LGG for 180 min.
      Non-adherent LGG was washed away prior to a 120-min incubation period with 10(5) 
      CFU E. coli C25. E. coli that had translocated across the enterocyte monolayer
      were quantified by growing basal-chamber media samples on gram-negative
      bacteria-specific MacConkey's agar. In order to determine monolayer integrity,
      transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was measured across Caco-2 cells
      treated with LGG and E. coli. Statistical analysis was by ANOVA with P < 0.05
      considered significant. LGG inhibited E. coli translocation at all LGG
      concentrations tested. The TEER ratio was not significantly altered by addition
      of LGG or E. coli (0.9 +/- 0.03 vs 0.8 +/- 0.05). These results demonstrate that 
      the probiotic bacterium LGG inhibits BT of E. coli C25 in a dose-dependent manner
      in an in-vitro cell-culture model. This model should be valuable in investigating
      the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the inhibition of pathological 
      enteral bacteria by probiotic agents.

PG  - 862-4
AB  - A total of 114 beef and baby beef samples were examined. The samples included
      ground baby beef, mixed ground baby beef and pork, and chopped and shaped meat.
      The samples were analyzed from 30 different grocery stores in Zagreb, Croatia.
      The object of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of Escherichia coli
      O157:H7 in the samples that can enhance the potential risk of outbreaks of
      hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome. The results in all tested
      samples of E. coli O157:H7 were negative. A single sample was positive in a latex
      agglutination test using antiserum to O157:H7. It was identified as Proteus
      vulgaris at the Pasteur Institute, Paris, France. This result correlates
      positively with cross-contamination with Yersinia enterocolitica 09, Brucella
      abortus, Salmonella type N, and Pseudomonas maltophila.

TI  - Apoptotic epithelial cells in biopsy specimens from infants with streaked rectal 
      bleeding.
PG  - 428-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: Histologic studies of rectosigmoidal mucosal biopsies of infants with
      isolated blood-streaked stool have shown many eosinophils and revealed aggregates
      of small dark granules (nuclear dust). However, no description of the nuclear
      dust has been made for this condition and the nature of the nuclear dust has not 
      been thoroughly investigated. We determined the characteristics of these
      particles in biopsies from infants with streaked rectal bleeding. METHODS:
      Nineteen infants who were younger than 6 months old and had isolated rectal
      bleeding were studied, as were six age-matched control infants. Rectosigmoidal
      mucosal biopsies were immunohistochemically assessed using anticarcinoembryonic
      antigen and macrophage-associated antibodies and examined for apoptotic cells by 
      modified in situ TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labelling. The number of
      apoptotic epithelial cells was compared between rectal bleeding and control
      groups. RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry showed that at least some of the nuclear
      dust consisted of apoptotic epithelial cells. Infants with rectal bleeding also
      showed nodular lymphoid hyperplasia (n = 16), abundant eosinophils (>20/high
      power field, n = 14) in the mucosa, and a significantly high number of apoptotic 
      epithelial cells relative to the control group. Rectal bleeding disappeared at
      6-month follow-up in 14 of 18 infants (one was lost to follow-up) who were fed a 
      different milk formula or breast-fed (their mothers were restricted from having
      cow's milk and eggs). CONCLUSIONS: The high number of apoptotic epithelial cells 
      in rectosigmoidal mucosal biopsies of infants with streaked rectal bleeding is
      probably caused by accelerated epithelial cell turnover and apoptosis.

TI  - Adaptation of bacteria to the intestinal niche: probiotics and gut disorder.
PG  - 136-45
AB  - The gastrointestinal tract is a complex ecosystem host to a diverse and highly
      evolved microbial community composed of hundreds of different microbial species. 
      The interactions that occur between this complex microbial community and the
      human host have become the focus of scientific research due to increases in the
      incidence of illnesses associated with deficient or compromised microflora (e.g.,
      gastrointestinal tract infections, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease
      and ulcerative colitis), irritable bowel syndrome, antibiotic-induced diarrhea,
      constipation, food allergies, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers).
      Effective multidisciplinary research programs now complement conventional
      microbiology with molecular ecology techniques to provide culture-independent
      analysis of the gastrointestinal ecosystem. Furthermore, as we acquire an
      understanding of gut microflora composition and processes such as intestinal
      adherence, colonization, translocation, and immunomodulation, we are also
      elucidating mechanisms by which these can be influenced. This knowledge not only 
      allows scientists to define the activities and interactions of "functional
      food"-borne beneficial bacteria in the gut, but will also provide the scientific 
      basis for the development of innovative biotechnology-based products tailored to 
      prevent specific diseases and promote overall human gastrointestinal health.

TI  - Etiology of Crohn's disease: the role of Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis.
PG  - 247-52
AB  - Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by
      transmural inflammation and granuloma formation. Several theories regarding the
      etiology of Crohn's disease have been proposed, one of which is infection with
      Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (M. paratuberculosis), which
      causes a similar disease in animals, and is present in the human food chain.
      Considerable evidence supports the presence of M. paratuberculosis in the
      intestinal tissues of many patients with Crohn's disease including culture,
      detection of homologous mycobacterial DNA, detection of the mycobacterial
      insertion sequence IS900 by both PCR and in situ hybridization in tissues, and a 
      serologic immune response to recombinant M. paratuberculosis antigens. Despite
      this evidence, and our personal belief that M. paratuberculosis is a cause of
      Crohn's disease, widespread acceptance of this hypothesis will require evidence
      that specific anti-mycobacterial chemotherapy will cure the disease.

TI  - A review of recent clinical trials of the nutritional supplement Chlorella
      pyrenoidosa in the treatment of fibromyalgia, hypertension, and ulcerative
      colitis.
PG  - 79-91
AB  - CONTEXT: It has been suggested that the consumption of natural "whole foods" rich
      in macronutrients has many healthful benefits for those who otherwise ingest a
      normal, nonvegetarian diet. One example is dietary supplements derived from
      Chlorella pyrenoidosa, a unicellular fresh water green alga rich in proteins,
      vitamins, and minerals. OBJECTIVE: To find evidence of the potential of chlorella
      dietary supplements to relieve signs and symptoms, improve quality of life, and
      normalize body functions in people with chronic illnesses, specifically
      fibromyalgia, hypertension, and ulcerative colitis. DESIGN: Double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials. SETTING: Virginia Commonwealth
      University's Medical College of Virginia. PATIENTS: Fifty-five subjects with
      fibromyalgia, 33 with hypertension, and 9 with ulcerative colitis. INTERVENTION: 
      Subjects consumed 10 g of pure chlorella in tablet form and 100 mL of a liquid
      containing an extract of chlorella each day for 2 or 3 months. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURES: For fibromyalgia patients, assessments of pain and overall quality of
      life. For hypertensive patients, measurements of sitting diastolic blood pressure
      and serum lipid levels. For patients with ulcerative colitis, determination of
      state of disease using the Disease Activity Index. RESULTS: Daily dietary
      supplementation with chlorella may reduce high blood pressure, lower serum
      cholesterol levels, accelerate wound healing, and enhance immune functions.
      CONCLUSIONS: The potential of chlorella to relieve symptoms, improve quality of
      life, and normalize body functions in patients with fibromyalgia, hypertension,
      or ulcerative colitis suggests that larger, more comprehensive clinical trials of
      chlorella are warranted.

TI  - Beneficial health effects of low-digestible carbohydrate consumption.
PG  - S23-30
AB  - Low-digestible carbohydrates represent a class of enzyme-resistant saccharides
      that have specific effects on the human gastrointestinal tract. in the small
      bowel, they affect nutrient digestion and absorption, glucose and lipid
      metabolism and protect against known risk factors of cardiovascular disease. In
      the colon they are mainly degraded by anaerobic bacteria in a process called
      fermentation. As a consequence, faecal nitrogen excretion is enhanced, which is
      used clinically to prevent or treat hepatic encephalopathy. Low-digestible
      carbohydrates are trophic to the epithelia of the ileum and colon, which helps to
      avoid bacterial translocation. Short-chain fatty acids are important fermentation
      products and are evaluated as new therapeutics in acute colitis. They are
      considered in the primary prevention of colorectal cancer. The bifidogenic effect
      of fructo-oligosaccharides merits further attention, Unfermented carbohydrates
      increase faecal bulk and play a role in the treatment of chronic functional
      constipation, symptomatic diverticulosis and, possibly, the irritable bowel
      syndrome. In conclusion, low-digestible carbohydrates may play a role in the
      maintenance of human digestive health. However, the strength of evidence differs 
      between disease entities.

TI  - Occupational mortality from inflammatory bowel disease in the United States
      1991-1996.
PG  - 1101-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The occupational distribution of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may 
      help to shed light on its yet unknown etiology. The U.S. vital statistics offer
      the opportunity to study cause of death by occupation and industry. METHODS: The 
      numbers of deaths from Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis were retrieved from
      the computerized 1991-1996 data files of the National Center for Health
      Statistics. Deaths were grouped by gender, ethnicity, disease type, occupation,
      and industry. Mortality by occupation and industry were expressed as proportional
      mortality ratio (PMR), adjusted for gender and ethnicity. RESULTS: Between 1991
      and 1996, 2399 subjects died from Crohn's disease and 2419 subjects died from
      ulcerative colitis. Significant correlations were found between the PMR values of
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease regarding their distribution by
      occupation, r = 0.36 and p < 0.05, as well as by industry, r = 0.37, p < 0.01.
      IBD mortality by occupation was significantly reduced among farmers (PMR: 70, 95%
      confidence interval [CI]: 42-97), mining machine operators (31, 95% CI: 0-74),
      and laborers (71. 95% CI: 45-98). A nonsignificant increase was found among sales
      persons (117, 95% CI: 95-139) and secretaries (122, 95% CI: 83-161). IBD
      mortality by industry was significantly reduced in agricultural production of
      livestock (39, 95% CI: 1-78), mining (46, 95% CI: 9-83), grocery stores (55, 95% 
      CI: 17-94), and work in private households (64, 95% CI: 30-97). A nonsignificant 
      increase was found in food production (128, 95% CI: 74-182), investment and
      insurance business (137, 95% CI: 77-198), and administration (122, 95% CI:
      81-163). CONCLUSIONS: IBD mortality is low in occupations associated with manual 
      work and farming and relatively high in sedentary occupations associated with
      indoor work. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis show a similar distribution.

TI  - Behaviour of the pharmaceutical probiotic preparation VSL#3 in human ileostomy
      effluent containing its own natural elements.
PG  - 23-33
AB  - The pharmaceutical probiotic VSL#3 (300 billion cfu/g lactic acid bacteria &
      bifidobacteria) was inoculated into human ileostomy effluent (HIE) to assess its 
      behaviour vs the ileo-caecal tract. Separately, yogurt bacteria (yog) and
      bifidobacteria (Bif) present in VSL#3 were also inoculated into HIE. During 37
      degrees C incubation (anaerobic condition) at zero, six and 24 hours, both cell
      growth in control HIE and indigenous Bif growth in HIE+yog were observed. Cells
      remained viable and metabolically active as shown by the increase in L(+) lactic 
      acid in HIE+VSL#3 and HIE+yog and the pH decreased (approx. 5.5 compared with the
      6.2 of control HIE). Total SCFA Short Chain Fatty Acids decreased in HIE+yog and 
      HIE+VSL#3 at 6h and in all cultures at 24h; butyric acid decreased in HIE+Bif and
      HIE+VSL#3. Generally in vivo the bacteria remain in the ileo-caecal tract no
      longer than six h, therefore VSL#3 bacteria seem able to pass this barrier
      viably, colonizing the large bowel.

TI  - Genome sequence of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.
PG  - 529-33
AB  - The bacterium Escherichia coli O157:H7 is a worldwide threat to public health and
      has been implicated in many outbreaks of haemorrhagic colitis, some of which
      included fatalities caused by haemolytic uraemic syndrome. Close to 75,000 cases 
      of O157:H7 infection are now estimated to occur annually in the United States.
      The severity of disease, the lack of effective treatment and the potential for
      large-scale outbreaks from contaminated food supplies have propelled intensive
      research on the pathogenesis and detection of E. coli O157:H7 (ref. 4). Here we
      have sequenced the genome of E. coli O157:H7 to identify candidate genes
      responsible for pathogenesis, to develop better methods of strain detection and
      to advance our understanding of the evolution of E. coli, through comparison with
      the genome of the non-pathogenic laboratory strain E. coli K-12 (ref. 5). We find
      that lateral gene transfer is far more extensive than previously anticipated. In 
      fact, 1,387 new genes encoded in strain-specific clusters of diverse sizes were
      found in O157:H7. These include candidate virulence factors, alternative
      metabolic capacities, several prophages and other new functions--all of which
      could be targets for surveillance.

TI  - Germinated barley foodstuff feeding. A novel neutraceutical therapeutic strategy 
      for ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 60-7
AB  - A germinated barley foodstuff (GBF) contained glutamine-rich protein and the
      hemicellulose-rich fiber was made from brewer's spent grain by physical isolation
      (milling and sieving). Both in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated that the
      fiber fraction of GBF supports maintenance of epithelial cell populations,
      facilitates epithelial repair, and suppresses epithelial nuclear factor kappa
      B-DNA binding activity through generating increased short-chain fatty acid
      (especially butyrate) production by luminal microflora which includes
      Bifidobacterium and Eubacterium, thereby preventing experimental colonic injury. 
      The fiber fraction also modulates stool water content by its high water-holding
      capacity. The protein fraction which contains larger glutamine prevents
      experimental small bowel injury. Based on these observations, clinical studies
      were initiated in patients with mild to moderate active ulcerative colitis. The
      patients who had been unresponsive to or intolerant of standard treatment
      received 30 grams of GBF feeding daily in a nonrandomized, open-label fashion. At
      4 weeks, this treatment resulted in a significant clinical and endoscopic
      improvement independent of disease extent. The improvement was associated with an
      increase in stool butyrate concentrations and in luminal Bifidobacterium and
      Eubacterium levels. After the end of GBF treatment the patients had an
      exacerbation of the disease. GBF was safe and well tolerated. These results
      indicate that GBF feeding is a potentially attractive treatment in patients with 
      ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Ischemic colitis during treatment with alosetron.
PG  - 557-60
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common entities observed by
      both primary care physicians and gastroenterologists. Alosetron is a potent and
      selective serotonin antagonist that recently became the first Food and Drug
      Administration-approved agent for diarrhea-predominant IBS. However, since
      approval, significant side effects have been noted with the use of alosetron
      including severe constipation, fecal impaction, and ischemic colitis. We describe
      a case of ischemic colitis in a male patient with IBS who was briefly treated
      with alosetron. Clinical, endoscopic, and pathologic features of the focal
      colitis strongly suggested ischemia. Symptoms correlated temporally with
      alosetron use, and symptoms abated with discontinuation of the drug. Endoscopic
      and pathologic resolution of the colitis were documented.

TI  - In vitro selection criteria for probiotic bacteria of human origin: correlation
      with in vivo findings.
PG  - 386S-392S
LID - 10.1093/ajcn/73.2.386s [doi]
AB  - The enteric flora comprises approximately 95% of the total number of cells in the
      human body and can elicit immune responses while protecting against microbial
      pathogens. However, the resident bacterial flora of the gastrointestinal tract
      may also be implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases such as inflammatory bowel
      disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease). The objectives of the Probiotic
      Research Group based at University College Cork were to isolate and identify
      lactic acid bacteria exhibiting beneficial probiotic traits, such as bile
      tolerance in the absence of deconjugation activity, acid resistance, adherence to
      host epithelial tissue, and in vitro antagonism of pathogenic microorganisms or
      those suspected of promoting inflammation. To isolate potentially effective
      probiotic bacteria, we screened the microbial population adhering to surgically
      resected segments of the gastrointestinal tract (the environment in which they
      may subsequently be reintroduced and required to function). In total, 1500
      bacterial strains from resected human terminal ilea were assessed. From among
      these organisms, Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salivarius strain UCC118 was
      selected for further study. In mouse feeding trials, milk-borne L. salivarius
      strain UCC118 could successfully colonize the murine gastrointestinal tract. A
      human feeding study conducted in 80 healthy volunteers showed that yogurt can be 
      used as a vehicle for delivery of strain UCC118 to the human gastrointestinal
      tract with considerable efficacy in influencing gut flora and colonization. In
      summary, we developed criteria for in vitro selection of probiotic bacteria that 
      may reflect certain in vivo effects on the host such as modulation of
      gastrointestinal tract microflora.

TI  - Genetic analysis for virulence factors in Escherichia coli O104:H21 that was
      implicated in an outbreak of hemorrhagic colitis.
PG  - 24-8
AB  - Isolates of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) of serotype O104:H21
      implicated in a 1994 outbreak of hemorrhagic colitis in Montana were analyzed for
      the presence of trait EHEC virulence markers. By using a multiplex PCR that
      specifically amplifies several genes, the O104:H21 strains were found to carry
      only the Shiga toxin 2 gene (stx2) and to express Stx2. They did not have the
      eaeA gene for gamma-intimin, which is typically found in O157:H7, or the alpha-
      or beta-intimin derivatives, which are common in other EHEC and enteropathogenic 
      E. coli serotypes. Results of the multiplex PCR also indicated that the ehxA gene
      for enterohemolysin was absent from O104:H21. This, however, was not consistent
      with the results of a phenotypic assay that showed them to be hemolytic or a PCR 
      analysis with another set of ehxA-specific primers, which indicated the presence 
      of ehxA. To resolve this discrepancy, the ehxA region in O104:H21 and O157:H7
      strains, to which the multiplex PCR primers anneal, was cloned and sequenced.
      Comparison of the sequences showed that the upstream primer binding site in the
      ehxA gene of O104:H21 was not identical to that of O157:H7. Specifically, there
      were several base mutations, including an A-to-G substitution at the 3' end of
      the primer binding site. These base mutations are presumably not unique to
      O104:H21, since other enterohemolytic serotypes were also not detected with the
      ehxA primers used in the multiplex PCR. Comparison of the ehxA sequences of
      O104:H21 strains with those of other Stx-producing E. coli strains showed that
      they more closely resembled those of O8:H19 strains, which have cluster II ehxA
      genes, than those of O157:H7 strains, which have cluster I ehxA sequences. By
      modifying the upstream ehxA primer, the multiplex PCR was able to detect ehxA
      genes in both O157:H7 and O104:H21 strains.
