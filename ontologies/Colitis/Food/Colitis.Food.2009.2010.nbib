TI  - DNFB-DNS hapten-induced colitis in mice should not be considered a model of
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 2087-101
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21586 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The dinitrofluorobenzene/dinitrosulfonic acid (DNFB/DNS) model was
      originally described as an experimental model of intestinal inflammation
      resembling human ulcerative colitis (UC). Due to the absence of acceptable UC
      experimental models for pharmacological preclinical assays, here we examine the
      immune response induced in this model. METHODS: Balb/c mice were sensitized by
      skin application of DNFB on day 1, followed by an intrarectal challenge with DNS 
      on day 5. We further expanded this model by administering a second DNS challenge 
      on day 15. The features of colonic inflammation and immune response were
      evaluated. RESULTS: The changes observed in colonic tissue corresponded, in
      comparison to the trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) colitis model, to a mild
      mucosal effect in the colon, which spontaneously resolved in less than 5 days.
      Furthermore, the second hapten challenge did not exacerbate the inflammatory
      response. In contrast to other studies, we did not observe any clear involvement 
      of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) or other Th1 cytokines during the
      initial inflammatory response; however, we found that a more Th2-humoral response
      appeared to mediate the first contact with the hapten. An increased humoral
      response was detected during the second challenge, although an increased
      Th1/Th17-cytokine expression profile was also simultaneously observed.
      CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of these results, although the DNFB/DNS model can
      display some features found in human UC, it should be considered as a model for
      the study of the intestinal hypersensitivity seen, for example, during food
      allergy or irritable bowel syndrome but not intestinal inflammation per se.

      intestinal inflammation.
PG  - 351-6
LID - 10.3920/BM2010.0034 [doi]
AB  - Soon after birth, the human gastrointestinal tract quickly becomes colonised by a
      variety of bacterial species. Throughout life the gastrointestinal tract
      continues to serve as host to a complex society of nonpathological bacteria.
      Microorganisms, such as probiotics, have the potential to modulate mucosal immune
      response and reduce gastrointestinal inflammation caused by a variety of
      infectious and allergic events. The most widely studied genera of probiotics are 
      lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. Lactobacillus rhamnosis strain ATC53103 (LGG)
      can replenish gut flora during infectious diarrhoeal episodes. This beneficial
      effect is carried over to traveller's diarrhoea and children experiencing
      antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Furthermore, LGG can reduce the risk of
      respiratory tract infections in children attending daycares and hospitals. With
      allergic disease on the rise, probiotics have the potential to positively impact 
      atopic dermatitis, asthma, and allergic rhinitis. LGG has been shown to decrease 
      the severity and delay the onset of atopic dermatitis. Additionally, LGG is
      beneficial in the treatment of allergic colitis and necrotising entercolitis.
      Some strains of probiotics appear to be useful in the treatment and/or prevention
      of allergic disease, however, caution must be used when generalising the
      effectiveness of a specific strain of organism to other organisms and other
      disease states.

TI  - [Influence of a combination of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria upon disease
      activity, stool pattern and nutritional status of ulcerative colitis patients].
PG  - 971-83
LID - S0212-16112010000600013 [pii]
AB  - UNLABELLED: A quasi-experimental clinical assay was carried out to assess the
      tolerance, safety and usefulness of a 4 lactobacili + 1 bifidobacterium
      combination as adjuvant to the pharmacological treatment of UC Ulcerative colitis
      patients differing in mucosal change. The effectiveness of the probiotic
      treatment was assessed from changes in patient's stool pattern, body composition,
      and selected biochemical indicators of disease activity and nutritional status.
      Fifty patients entered consecutively in the trial between December 2005-June 2009
      (CONTROL GROUP: 29; Treatment Group: 21). Twenty of them completed treatment with
      probiotics. Effectiveness of regular pharmacological treatment was recorded with 
      24 control patients. Thirty-six days of probiotic treatment per patient were
      accumulated. Probiotic treatment obedience rate was 99.3%. Five days of treatment
      were lost due to non-availability of the product. No adverse reactions were
      reported after probiotic treatment. Two deaths were recorded after completion of 
      the study, one on each group. Improvement in the quality of the stools [RR
      Relative risk: 1.69; 95% IC: 0.87-3.27]; frequency [RR: 1.35; 95% IC:
      0.15-11.90]; and volume [RR: 1.11; 95% IC: 0.16-7.63] was observed in treated
      patients, although biological variability prevented these trends to become
      statistically significant. Probiotic treatment also resulted in reduction of
      occurrence of nocturnal depositions [RR: 1.75; 95% IC: 0.53-5.73]. Probiotic
      treatment prevented the onset of undesirable changes in stool pattern of treated 
      patients who presented free of symptoms, but observed effect was no superior to
      that of medication administered. Probiotic treatment did not influence upon
      presence of blood in stools. Probiotic treatment also resulted in reduction of
      disease activity and ESR Erythro-sedimentation rate, respectively [Change in the 
      Clinical Activity Index: CONTROL GROUP: -1.1 +/- 3.2 vs. Treatment Group: -4.1
      +/- 3.3; p < 0.05; Change in ESR: CONTROL GROUP: 3.6 +/- 16.4 vs. Treatment
      Group: -6.7 +/- 15.6; p < 0.05]. Adjuvant probiotic treatment resulted in
      increase of body weight, at the expenses of increase of MAMC Mid-arm Muscle
      Circumference and sum of skinfolds. Probiotic effect upon body weight was not
      attributed to increased food intakes in treated patients. In spite of clinical
      heterogeneity associated to mucosal damage in UC, probiotic treatment might
      result in beneficial effects upon patient's stool pattern, body composition, and 
      selected biochemical indicators of disease activity. Invariance of food intakes
      could imply that observed changes in response variables were not the result of a 
      placebo effect of used probiotic combination.

TI  - E durans strain M4-5 isolated from human colonic flora attenuates intestinal
      inflammation.
PG  - 1676-86
LID - 10.1007/DCR.0b013e3181f4b148 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro and in vivo effects of a 
      unique high-butyrate-producing bacterial strain from human colonic flora,
      Enterococcus durans, in prevention and treatment of intestinal inflammation.
      METHODS: A compartmentalized Caco-2/leukocyte coculture model was used to examine
      the in vitro effects of E durans and its metabolite butyrate on basal and
      Escherichia coli-stimulated secretion of proinflammatory immune factors (IL-8,
      IL-6, and TNF-alpha) and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. A murine model of 
      dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis was used to examine in vivo effects of
      prevention and therapy with E durans on clinical, biochemical, and histologic
      parameters of inflammation. RESULTS: In the coculture model, treatment with E
      durans and with butyrate reduced basal as well as E coli stimulated secretion of 
      IL-8, IL-6, and TNF-alpha and increased secretion of IL-10. In the in vivo murine
      model, preventive administration of E durans significantly ameliorated clinical
      disease activity index (weight loss, fecal bleeding, and stool consistency),
      reduced myeloperoxidase concentration in colon tissue extracts, improved
      histologic scores of colonic inflammation, and inhibited colonic transcription of
      proinflammatory immune factors. The effect of therapeutic treatment alone on
      these parameters was more moderate but still significant. CONCLUSIONS: We
      conclude that E durans strain M4 to 5 and its metabolic product butyrate induce
      significant anti-inflammatory effects, mediated by regulation of pro- and
      anti-inflammatory immune factors as well as preservation of intestine epithelial 
      integrity, suggesting that this novel anti-inflammatory bacterium may be
      preferentially a useful prophylactic treatment to avoid inflammatory bowel
      disease.

TI  - Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli in children: diagnosis and clinical
      manifestations of O157:H7 and non-O157:H7 infection.
PG  - 955-9
LID - 10.1128/JCM.02119-10 [doi]
AB  - Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), a cause of food-borne colitis and 
      hemolytic-uremic syndrome in children, can be serotype O157:H7 (O157) or other
      serotypes (non-O157). E. coli O157 can be detected by culture with
      sorbitol-MacConkey agar (SMAC), but non-O157 STEC cannot be detected with this
      medium. Both O157 and non-O157 STEC can be detected by immunoassay for Shiga
      toxins 1 and 2. The objectives of this study were first to compare the diagnostic
      utility of SMAC to that of the Premier EHEC enzyme immunoassay (Meridian
      Diagnostics) for detection of STEC in children and second to compare the clinical
      and laboratory characteristics of children with serotype O157:H7 STEC and
      non-O157:H7 STEC infections. Stool samples submitted for testing for STEC between
      April 2004 and September 2009 were tested by both SMAC culture and the Premier
      EHEC assay at Children's Hospital Boston. Samples positive by either test were
      sent for confirmatory testing and serotyping at the Hinton State Laboratory
      Institute (HSLI). Chart review was performed on children with confirmed STEC
      infection. Of 5,110 children tested for STEC, 50 (0.9%) had STEC infection
      confirmed by culture; 33 were O157:H7 and 17 were non-O157:H7. The Premier EHEC
      assay and SMAC culture detected 96.0% and 58.0% of culture-confirmed STEC
      isolates (any serotype), respectively, and 93.9% and 87.9% of STEC O157:H7
      isolates, respectively. There were no significant differences in disease severity
      or laboratory manifestations of STEC infection between children with O157:H7 and 
      those with non-O157 STEC. The Premier EHEC assay was significantly more sensitive
      than SMAC culture for diagnosis of STEC, and O157:H7 and non-O157:H7 STEC caused 
      infections of similar severity in children.

PG  - 417-27
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2010.04541.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Up to one-third of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) do 
      not respond to, or are intolerant of conventional immunosuppressive drugs.
      Although biological agents are alternative treatments, they may not be suitable
      or available to some patients. AIM: To review the evidence for use of
      nonbiological drugs in the treatment of patients with IBD refractory to
      corticosteroids or thiopurines. METHODS: A literature search was performed using 
      PubMed for English language publications with predetermined search criteria to
      identify relevant studies. RESULTS: Published evidence from uncontrolled series
      and controlled clinical trials has been used to produce a practical approach
      relevant to clinical practice which incorporates the indication, optimal dose,
      and side effects of various therapies including tacrolimus, methotrexate,
      thalidomide, tioguanine, mycophenolate mofotil, leucocyte apheresis, nutritional 
      therapy, antibiotics, probiotics, allopurinol, rectal acetarsol and ciclosporin
      in the treatment of patients with refractory ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
      disease. Approaches to optimise thiopurine efficacy are also discussed.
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD refractory to corticosteroids or thiopurines may
      respond to alternative anti-inflammatory chemical molecules, but the evidence
      base for many of these alternatives is limited and further trials are needed.

TI  - Zoonotic enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli: A One Health perspective.
PG  - 221-32
AB  - Escherichia coli O157 and other enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) are food- and
      waterborne zoonotic pathogens that cause diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, and
      hemolytic uremic syndrome in humans but little or no discernible disease in their
      animal reservoirs. Like other zoonotic infections, EHEC are illustrative of the
      One Health concept as they embody the complex ecology of agricultural animals,
      wildlife, and the environment in zoonotic transmission of EHEC O157. But compared
      to the detailed epidemiological and clinical information available for EHEC
      infection in humans, there is an incomplete understanding of the ecology of EHEC 
      infection in animals and the persistence of EHEC bacteria in the environment.
      Significant aspects of the microbiology, epidemiology, and host-pathogen
      interactions of EHEC in animals remain undefined. This review highlights the
      nature of EHEC infection in humans, provides a One Health perspective on what is 
      known about EHEC in animal and environmental reservoirs, and proposes
      interventions targeted at pathways of transmission to optimize effective
      prevention and control measures.

TI  - Prevalence of anaemia in inflammatory bowel disease in Switzerland: a
      cross-sectional study in patients from private practices and university
      hospitals.
PG  - 642-8
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2010.07.008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anaemia represents a common complication of inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). Most studies on anaemia in IBD patients have been performed in
      tertiary referral centres (RC) and data from gastroenterologic practices (GP) are
      lacking. We investigated the frequency and severity of anaemia in IBD patients
      from tertiary referral centres and gastroenterologic practices compared to the
      general population. METHODS: Data were acquired from patients included in the
      Swiss IBD Cohort Study. IBD activity was evaluated by CDAI and modified Truelove 
      and Witts severity index (MTWSI). Anaemia was defined as haemoglobin </=120g/L in
      women and </=130g/L in men. RESULTS: 125 patients from RC (66 with Crohn's
      disease (CD) and 59 with ulcerative colitis (UC)) and 116 patients from GP (71 CD
      and 45 UC) were included and compared to 6074 blood donors. Anaemia was found in 
      21.2% (51/241) of the IBD patients and more frequently in patients from RC as
      compared to GP and healthy controls (28.8% vs. 12.9% vs. 3.4%; P<0.01). IBD
      patients from RC suffered more frequently from active disease compared to IBD
      patients in GP (36% vs. 23%, P=0.032). Supplementation therapy (iron, vitamin
      B12, folic acid) was performed in 40% of anaemic IBD patients in GP as compared
      to 43% in RC. CONCLUSIONS: Anaemia is a common complication in patients with IBD 
      and significantly more prevalent in patients from referral centres as compared to
      patients from gastroenterologic practices. Physicians treating IBD patients
      should pay attention to the presence of anaemia and ensure sufficient
      supplementation therapy.

TI  - New system for multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis of the
      enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli strains belonging to three major serogroups:
      O157, O26, and O111.
PG  - 569-77
LID - 10.1111/j.1348-0421.2010.00252.x [doi]
AB  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), a food- and waterborne pathogen,
      causes diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, and life-threatening HUS. MLVA is a newly
      developed and widely accepted genotyping tool. An MLVA system for EHEC O157
      involving nine genomic loci has already been established. However, the present
      study revealed that the above-mentioned MLVA system cannot analyze EHEC O26 and
      O111 isolates-the second and third most dominant EHEC serogroups in Japan,
      respectively. Therefore, with several modifications to the O157 system and the
      use of nine additional loci, we developed an expanded MLVA system applicable to
      EHEC O26, O111, and O157. Our MLVA system had a relatively high resolution power 
      for each of the three serogroups: Simpson's index of diversity was 0.991 (95% CI 
      = 0.989-0.993), 0.988 (95% CI, 0.986-0.990), and 0.986 (95% CI, 0.979-0.993) for 
      O26, O111, and O157, respectively. This system also detected outbreak-related
      isolates; the isolates collected during each of the 12 O26 and O111 outbreaks
      formed unique clusters, and most of the repeat copy numbers among the isolates
      collected during the same outbreak exhibited no or single-locus variations. These
      results were comparable to those of cluster analyses based on PFGE profiles.
      Therefore, our system can complement PFGE analysis-the current golden method.
      Because EHEC strains of three major serogroups can be rapidly analyzed on a
      single platform with our expanded MLVA system, this system could be widely used
      in molecular epidemiological studies of EHEC infections.

TI  - Probiotics and prebiotics in pediatrics.
PG  - 1217-31
LID - 10.1542/peds.2010-2548 [doi]
AB  - This clinical report reviews the currently known health benefits of probiotic and
      prebiotic products, including those added to commercially available infant
      formula and other food products for use in children. Probiotics are supplements
      or foods that contain viable microorganisms that cause alterations of the
      microflora of the host. Use of probiotics has been shown to be modestly effective
      in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in (1) treating acute viral gastroenteritis 
      in healthy children; and (2) preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea in healthy
      children. There is some evidence that probiotics prevent necrotizing
      enterocolitis in very low birth weight infants (birth weight between 1000 and
      1500 g), but more studies are needed. The results of RCTs in which probiotics
      were used to treat childhood Helicobacter pylori gastritis, irritable bowel
      syndrome, chronic ulcerative colitis, and infantile colic, as well as in
      preventing childhood atopy, although encouraging, are preliminary and require
      further confirmation. Probiotics have not been proven to be beneficial in
      treating or preventing human cancers or in treating children with Crohn disease. 
      There are also safety concerns with the use of probiotics in infants and children
      who are immunocompromised, chronically debilitated, or seriously ill with
      indwelling medical devices. Prebiotics are supplements or foods that contain a
      nondigestible food ingredient that selectively stimulates the favorable growth
      and/or activity of indigenous probiotic bacteria. Human milk contains substantial
      quantities of prebiotics. There is a paucity of RCTs examining prebiotics in
      children, although there may be some long-term benefit of prebiotics for the
      prevention of atopic eczema and common infections in healthy infants.
      Confirmatory well-designed clinical research studies are necessary.

TI  - Randomised clinical trial: herbal extract HMPL-004 in active ulcerative colitis -
      a double-blind comparison with sustained release mesalazine.
PG  - 194-202
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2010.04515.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Andrographis paniculata is an herbal mixture used to treat
      inflammatory diseases. An extract of the herb, HMPL-004, inhibits TNF-alpha and
      IL-1beta, and prevents colitis in animal models. AIM: To determine the efficacy
      and safety of HMPL-004 in patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis.
      METHODS: A randomised, double-blind, multicentre, 8-week parallel group study was
      conducted using HMPL-004 1200 mg/day compared with 4500 mg/day of slow release
      mesalazine (mesalamine) granules in patients with mild-to-moderately active
      ulcerative colitis. Disease activity was assessed at baseline and every 2 weeks
      for clinical response, and at baseline and 8 weeks by colonoscopy. RESULTS: One
      hundred and twenty patients at five centres in China were randomised and dosed.
      Clinical remission and response were seen in 21% and 76% of HMPL-004-treated
      patients, and 16% and 82% of mesalazine-treated patients. By colonoscopy,
      remission and response were seen in 28% and 74% of HMPL-004-treated patients and 
      24% and 71% of mesalazine-treated patients, respectively. There was no
      significant difference between the two treatment groups. CONCLUSION: HMPL-004 may
      be an efficacious alternative to mesalazine in ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Verocytotoxigenic (Shiga toxin-producing) Escherichia coli: virulence factors and
      pathogenicity in the farm to fork paradigm.
PG  - 357-65
LID - 10.1089/fpd.2010.0699 [doi]
AB  - Verocytotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC) are a good example of the evolution and
      emergence of pathogenic E. coli. Unknown before the late 1970s, these bacteria
      are a major cause of hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome worldwide.
      The production of verocytotoxins is the main virulence feature of VTEC but cannot
      be solely responsible for full pathogenicity. VTEC associated with severe human
      disease are usually capable of colonizing the intestinal mucosa with a
      characteristic attaching-and-effacing mechanism, genetically governed by the
      locus of enterocyte effacement, and possess other mobile genetic elements
      carrying additional virulence genes such as plasmids, phages, and pathogenicity
      islands (e.g., O-I 122). Despite the huge amount of data collected after the
      sequencing of the full genome of VTEC O157, the virulence and the evolution of
      the different VTEC serotypes have only been partially unraveled. A greater
      understanding of the factors governing the development of severe disease in
      humans and the colonization of animal hosts must be achieved before effective
      intervention strategies aimed at the reduction of the burden of infection can be 
      developed. Defining all the factors characterizing a fully pathogenic VTEC strain
      will be crucial to improve the efficacy of the diagnosis of human infections, the
      surveillance of animal reservoirs, the assessment of public health risks, and the
      development of control interventions. An overview of the VTEC virulence factors, 
      including their genetic basis and function, would start this process and is the
      objective of this article.

      the gut microbiota.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggest a link between gut microbiota and the
      development of ulcerative colitis (UC) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Our
      aim was to investigate any quantitative differences in faecal bacterial
      compositions in UC and IBS patients compared to healthy controls, and to identify
      individual bacterial species that contribute to these differences. METHODS:
      Faecal microbiota of 13 UC patients, 11 IBS patients and 22 healthy volunteers
      were analysed by PCR-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) using
      universal and Bacteroides specific primers. The data obtained were normalized
      using in-house developed statistical method and interrogated by multivariate
      approaches. The differentiated bands were excised and identified by sequencing
      the V3 region of the 16S rRNA genes. RESULTS: Band profiles revealed that number 
      of predominant faecal bacteria were significantly different between UC, IBS and
      control group (p < 10-4). By assessing the mean band numbers in UC (37 +/- 5) and
      IBS (39 +/- 6), compared to the controls (45 +/- 3), a significant decrease in
      bacterial species is suggested (p = 0.01). There were no significant differences 
      between IBS and UC. Biodiversity of the bacterial species was significantly lower
      in UC (mu = 2.94, sigma = 0.29) and IBS patients (mu = 2.90, sigma = 0.38) than
      controls (mu = 3.25, sigma = 0.16; p = 0.01). Moreover, similarity indices
      revealed greater biological variability of predominant bacteria in UC and IBS
      compared to the controls (median Dice coefficients 76.1% (IQR 70.9 - 83.1), 73.8%
      (IQR 67.0 - 77.5) and 82.9% (IQR 79.1 - 86.7) respectively). DNA sequencing of
      discriminating bands suggest that the presence of Bacteroides vulgatus, B.
      ovatus, B. uniformis, and Parabacteroides sp. in healthy volunteers distinguishes
      them from IBS and UC patients. DGGE profiles of Bacteroides species revealed a
      decrease of Bacteroides community in UC relative to IBS and controls. CONCLUSION:
      Molecular profiling of faecal bacteria revealed abnormalities of intestinal
      microbiota in UC and IBS patients, while different patterns of Bacteroides
      species loss in particular, were associated with UC and IBS.

AB  - AIMS: To investigate the effects of human gut micro-organisms on cytokine
      production by human intestinal cell lines. METHODS AND RESULTS: Quantitative
      real-time PCR assays were developed to measure the production of pro-inflammatory
      (IL-1alpha, IL-6, IL-18 and TNFalpha) and anti-inflammatory (TGF-beta1,
      TGF-beta2, TGF-beta3, IL-4 and IL-10) cytokines in HT-29 and Caco-2 cell lines.
      They were co-cultured with a range of mucosal bacteria isolated from ulcerative
      colitis patients, together with lactobacilli and bifidobacteria obtained from
      healthy people. HT-29 cells were also co-cultured with Campylobacter jejuni,
      enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), enteropathogenic E. coli and Salmonella 
      typhimurium. The majority of commensal bacteria tested suppressed the expression 
      of anti-inflammatory cytokine mRNA, increased IL-18, reduced IL-1alpha, and with 
      the exception of nonpathogenic E. coli, reduced TNF-alpha. All overtly pathogenic
      species increased both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine mRNA.
      CONCLUSION: Commensal and pathogenic species induced fundamentally different
      cytokine responses in human intestinal epithelial cell lines. SIGNIFICANCE AND
      IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Interactions between commensal bacteria tested in this study
      and the innate immune system were shown to be anti-inflammatory in nature, in
      contrast to the pathogenic organisms investigated. These data contribute towards 
      our understanding of how potential probiotic species can be used to suppress the 
      pro-inflammatory response in inflammatory bowel disease.

AB  - It is important to consider that between Jul-October 2009 in the pathologic
      center of infectious diseases (Tbilisi State Medical University Department of
      Infectious Diseases) among hospitalized patients with hemorrhagic colitis 25
      patients developed HUS syndrome. Most of patients were rural residents 20 (80%), 
      only 5 (20%) were urban. 11 (44%) patients were children, 14 (56%) were adults.
      Male and female rate was equal. All the patients related the onset of the disease
      with the consumption of notwashed raw fruits or vegetables, nonpasteurized dairy 
      products, food from street vendors, soft cheeses made from raw milk and untreated
      water in areas lacking adequate chlorination. The onset of the disease was not
      acute: low grade fever (37,5-37,8(0)C), severe diffuse pain in abdomen
      accompanied with cramps, frequent bowel movement with loose, watery stools 5-6
      times a day. On the 2-3rd days of disease condition was worsened by increased of 
      intoxication and frequent bowel movement with bloody stools about 10-15-20 times 
      a day. On the 3-4 rd days of the onset of the diarrhea developed oliguria,
      anuria, edema. Among other complications important were: polyserosit - 8 (32%),
      encephalopathy - 2 (8%), disseminated intravascular coagulation - 3 (14%), ileus 
      -1 (4%,) acute reactive phsycosis - 1 (4)%. In 15 (60%) cases became necessary to
      carry out hemodialysis. died 5 patients, lethality is - 5 (20%). Treatment
      options included: pathogenetic and symptomatic. Thus, increased rate of patients 
      in the recent years indicates to circulation of shiga-toxin producing E.Coli in
      Georgia.

TI  - An association between dietary arachidonic acid, measured in adipose tissue, and 
      ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1912-7
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2010.07.065 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Dietary arachidonic acid, an n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid
      (n-6 PUFA), might be involved in the etiology of ulcerative colitis (UC). We
      performed a prospective cohort study to determine whether high levels of
      arachidonic acid in adipose tissue samples (which reflects dietary intake) are
      associated with UC. METHODS: We analyzed data collected from 57,053 men and women
      in the EPIC-Denmark Prospective Cohort Study from 1993 to 1997. Adipose tissue
      biopsy samples were collected from gluteal regions at the beginning of the study,
      the cohort was monitored over subsequent years, and participants who developed UC
      were identified. A subcohort of 2510 randomly selected participants were used as 
      controls. Concentrations of arachidonic acid were measured in adipose tissue
      samples. In the analysis, arachidonic acid levels were divided into quartiles;
      relative risks (RR) were calculated and adjusted for smoking, use of aspirin and 
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and levels of n-3 PUFAs. RESULTS: A total
      of 34 subjects (56% men) developed incident UC at a median age of 58.8 years
      (range, 50.0-69.0 years). Those in the highest quartile for arachidonic acid
      concentrations in adipose tissue had an RR for UC of 4.16 (95% confidence
      interval [CI]: 1.56-11.04); a trend per 0.1% increase in arachidonic acid of 1.77
      in RR was observed (95% CI: 1.38-2.27). The fraction attributed the highest
      levels of arachidonic acid was 40.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with the highest
      relative concentrations of arachidonic acid in adipose tissue have a
      significantly greater risk of developing UC. Dietary modifications might
      therefore prevent UC or reduce disease symptoms.

TI  - The enteric nervous system as a regulator of intestinal epithelial barrier
      function in health and disease.
PG  - 637-51
LID - 10.1586/egh.10.51 [doi]
AB  - The intestinal epithelia proliferate and differentiate along the crypt villus
      axis to constitute a barrier cell layer separating some 10(1)(3) potentially
      harmful bacteria from a sterile mucosal compartment. Strict regulatory mechanisms
      are required to maintain a balance between the appropriate uptake of luminal food
      components and proteins, while constraining the exposure of the mucosal
      compartment to luminal antigens and microbes. The enteric nervous system is
      increasingly recognized as such a regulatory housekeeper of the epithelial
      barrier integrity, in addition to its ascribed immunomodulatory potential.
      Inflammation affects both epithelial integrity and barrier function and, in turn,
      loss of barrier function perpetuates inflammatory conditions. The observation
      that inflammatory conditions affect enteric neurons may add to the dysregulated
      barrier function in chronic disease. Here, we review the current understanding of
      the regulatory role of the nervous system in the maintenance of barrier function 
      in healthy state, or during pathological conditions of, for instance,
      stress-induced colitis, surgical trauma or inflammation. We will discuss the
      clinical potential for advances in understanding the role of the enteric nervous 
      system in this important phenomenon.

TI  - Soyasaponin I attenuates TNBS-Induced colitis in mice by inhibiting NF-kappaB
      pathway.
PG  - 10929-34
LID - 10.1021/jf102296y [doi]
AB  - Soybean, which contains soyasaponins and isoflavones as representative
      constituents, exhibits anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. To understand
      the anti-inflammatory effects of soyasaponins, we isolated soyasaponin I, a major
      constituent of soybean, and investigated the inhibitory effects on inflammatory
      markers in LPS-stimulated mouse peritoneal macrophages and
      3,4,5-trinitrobenzenosulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitic mice. Soyasaponin I,
      which exhibited lipid peroxidation-inhibitory effects in vitro, inhibited the
      production of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-1beta), inflammatory
      mediators (NO and PGE2), and inflammatory enzymes (COX-2 and iNOS) in
      LPS-stimulated peritoneal macrophages. Soyasaponin I also suppressed the
      phosphorylation of IkappaB-alpha and the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB.
      However, these soyasaponins barely inhibited mitogen-activated protein kinases.
      Oral administration of soyasaponin I (10 and 20 mg/kg) to TNBS-treated colitic
      mice significantly reduced inflammatory markers, colon length, myeloperoxidase,
      lipid peroxide (malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal), proinflammatory
      cytokines and NF-kappaB activation in the colon, as well as increased glutathione
      content, superoxide dismutase, and catalase activity. Based on these findings,
      soyasaponin I may attenuate colitis by inhibiting the NF-kappaB pathway.

TI  - Diagnosis and management of pouchitis and ileoanal pouch dysfunction.
PG  - 485-94
LID - 10.1007/s11894-010-0143-y [doi]
AB  - Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) has become
      the surgical treatment of choice for patients with medically refractory
      ulcerative colitis (UC) or UC with dysplasia and for the majority of patients
      with familial adenomatous polyposis. However, UC patients with IPAA are
      susceptible to inflammatory and noninflammatory sequelae, such as pouchitis,
      Crohn's disease of the pouch, cuffitis, and irritable pouch syndrome, in addition
      to common surgery-associated complications, which adversely affect the surgical
      outcome and compromise health-related quality of life. Pouchitis is the most
      frequent long-term complication of IPAA in patients with UC, with a cumulative
      prevalence of up to 50%. Pouchitis may be classified based on the etiology into
      idiopathic and secondary types, and the management is often different.
      Pouchoscopy is the most important tool for the diagnosis and differential
      diagnosis in patients with pouch dysfunction. Antibiotic therapy is the mainstay 
      of treatment for active pouchitis. Some patients may develop dependency on
      antibiotics, requiring long-term maintenance therapy. Although management of
      antibiotic-dependent or antibiotic-refractory pouchitis has been challenging,
      secondary etiology for pouchitis should be evaluated and modified, if possible.

AB  - Understanding the importance of the fecal microbiota has been key in
      understanding the pathophysiology of some infectious diarrheas. In addition to
      normal protective measures of bile, gastric acid, and immune response, among
      others, we now know that the healthy gut flora protects us from some infectious
      diarrheas. Antibiotic associated diarrhea (AAD) is an excellent example, as
      antibiotics perturb the normal flora; the resulting diarrhea may be due to
      changes in short chain fatty acid metabolism. A severe form of AAD is due to
      Clostridium difficile, a pathogen that can cause severe diarrhea, colitis and
      even death. Recurrent Clostridium difficile diarrhea is a difficult clinical
      problem to treat successfully because one recurrence makes further recurrences
      more likely, probably because antibiotics are still needed to treat and thus the 
      fecal flora remains abnormal. There is no single effective treatment but
      therapies include pulsed and tapered antibiotics, the probiotic Saccharomyces
      boulardii as an adjunct to antibiotics, and even fecal flora reconstitution. It
      is likely that we will learn even more in the future about the beneficial effect 
      of our microbiota.

TI  - Epidemiologic clues to inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 495-501
LID - 10.1007/s11894-010-0144-x [doi]
AB  - In this article, the recent literature exploring the epidemiology of inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) is reviewed. Epidemiologic studies present data on disease
      burden, but may also provide clues to disease etiology. The emergence of IBD in
      developing nations warrants a systematic search for environmental changes in
      those countries to explain the evolution of IBD. The hygiene hypothesis suggests 
      that an alteration in the microbial environment experienced by the host
      facilitates the evolution of chronic immune-mediated diseases. One complex
      database study suggested that areas with high species richness of human
      intestinal helminthes are areas with genetic changes in interleukin gene loci. In
      other words, over the years, the microbial ecology has affected human genetics,
      which in turn would have an impact on immune responses. Other factors affect the 
      gut microbiome, and several studies have explored the increase in incidence of
      IBD in relation to such factors as exogenous infections, use of antibiotics, and 
      diet.

AB  - The paper describes a rare manifestation of Blastocystis hominis infection in a
      3-month-old baby with food allergy that appeared as atopic dermatitis and
      coloproctitis induced by food proteins (cow's milk, hen's egg). The fact that
      food allergy may be one of the predisposing factors in the development of
      clinical manifestations of B. hominis infection is discussed. The assumption that
      the amoeboid form of blastocysts accompanies the clinical manifestation of the
      infection is confirmed.

TI  - Preventive oral treatment with resveratrol pro-prodrugs drastically reduce colon 
      inflammation in rodents.
PG  - 7365-76
LID - 10.1021/jm1007006 [doi]
AB  - There is no pharmaceutical or definitive surgical cure for inflammatory bowel
      diseases (IBDs). The naturally occurring polyphenol resveratrol exerts
      anti-inflammatory properties. However, its rapid metabolism diminishes its
      effectiveness in the colon. The design of prodrugs to targeting active molecules 
      to the colon provides an opportunity for therapy of IBDs. Herein we explore the
      efficacy of different resveratrol prodrugs and pro-prodrugs to ameliorate colon
      inflammation in the murine dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) model. Mice fed with a
      very low dose (equivalent to 10 mg for a 70 kg-person) of either
      resveratrol-3-O-(6'-O-butanoyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside (6) or
      resveratrol-3-O-(6'-O-octanoyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside (7) did not develop
      colitis symptoms and improved 6-fold the disease activity index (DAI) compared to
      resveratrol. Our results indicate that these pro-prodrugs exerted a dual effect: 
      (1) they prevented the rapid metabolism of resveratrol and delivered higher
      quantities of resveratrol to the colon and (2) they reduced mucosal barrier
      imbalance and prevented diarrhea, which consequently facilitated the action of
      the delivered resveratrol in the colon mucosa.

TI  - Probiotic and prebiotic use in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a
      case-control study.
PG  - 2099-108
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21286 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of complementary and alternative medicine in inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) has been extensively studied. However, the use of probiotics 
      and prebiotics is poorly documented, despite evidence of efficacy of particular
      probiotic strains in specific forms of IBD. METHODS: A case-control study
      comprising interviewer-administered questionnaires was conducted in IBD patients 
      and healthy controls. Data regarding use and knowledge of probiotics and
      prebiotics, demographic, and clinical information were collected. RESULTS: In
      total, 334 participants (234 IBD, 100 controls) were interviewed. Significantly
      more IBD patients than controls had ever used probiotics to manage their health
      (Crohn's disease [CD] 43%, ulcerative colitis [UC] 51%, controls 21%, P < 0.001).
      Prebiotic use was negligible. On logistic regression analysis, having UC (odds
      ratio [OR] 4.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.27-8.12) or CD (OR 3.05, 95% CI
      1.66-5.60) were the strongest predictors of probiotic use. Within IBD patients
      the strongest predictor of probiotic use was current steroid use (OR 2.4, 95% CI 
      1.11-5.18). IBD patients had greater probiotic knowledge scores than controls (P 
      = 0.003), although 20% of IBD probiotic users could not provide a definition of a
      probiotic. Less than half of IBD probiotic users discussed probiotic use with
      healthcare professionals, with commercial advertising being the primary source of
      information. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD use probiotics to manage their health
      but frequently choose strains without evidence of efficacy in IBD. Patients rely 
      on nonclinical sources of information and often do not disclose probiotic use to 
      healthcare professionals. Conventional healthcare providers should inquire about 
      probiotic use among their patients and offer evidence-based advice.

AB  - The objective of our study was to investigate the prevalence of CD4 T lymphocyte 
      subsets and their commitment to TH1 or TH2 direction in 10 infants with allergic 
      colitis (AC) and 10 healthy controls. Infants with AC presented with a higher
      ratio of naive to memory cells, lower prevalence of activated CD4CD25 cells and
      FoxP3 regulatory cells, and a shift to TH2 direction in balance compared with
      controls. These alterations are normalized upon cessation of AC symptoms on
      elemental L-amino acid formula. These findings suggest the importance of antigen 
      exposure in AC in infancy.

TI  - [Taxonomy and pathogenic mechanism of Cronobacter (Enterobacter sakazakii)--a
      review].
PG  - 841-6
AB  - Enterobacter sakazakii is an important food-borne pathogen that causes
      life-threatening meningitis and necrotizing colitis in neonates and children. In 
      2008, Enterobacter sakazakii has been reclassified as five species in a new
      genus, Cronobacter gen. nov. within the Enterobacteriaceae. There is the
      variation in virulence between species in the new genus. OmpA of Cronobacter gen.
      nov. plays a critical role in attachment to their host cell and persistence
      within macrophages. Disruption of the tight junction significantly enhances the
      efficiency of invasion. Specific probiotic strains and their combinations
      counteract adhesion of Cronobacter gen. nov to intestinal mucus. At present, very
      limited information is available regarding the pathogenesis of Cronobacter gen.
      nov. Further detailed mechanism studies on the pathogenicity are warranted.

TI  - Effect of probiotics on pro-inflammatory cytokines and NF-kappaB activation in
      ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 4145-51
AB  - AIM: To demonstrate the therapeutic effect of probiotics in patients with
      ulcerative colitis (UC), and their effect on inflammatory mediators and nuclear
      factor (NF)-kappaB activation in these patients. METHODS: Thirty patients with
      mild to moderate UC were randomly classified into two groups: sulfasalazine
      group, who received sulfasalazine 2400 mg/d; and probiotic group, who received
      sulfasalazine 2400 mg/d with probiotic. The patients were investigated before and
      after 8 wk of treatment with probiotic (Lactobacillus delbruekii and
      Lactobacillus fermentum). Colonic activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) was assayed
      with UV spectrophotometry, the colonic content of interleukin (IL)-6 was
      determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), fecal calprotectin was
      determined by ELISA, and expression of NF-kappaB p65 and tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF)-alpha proteins in colonic tissue was identified by immunohistochemistry and
      reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, respectively. RESULTS: At the
      start of the study, colonic mucosal injury and inflammation were demonstrated in 
      UC patients by hematoxylin and eosin staining, and an increase in colonic MPO
      activity, fecal calprotectin, and expression of colonic TNF-alpha and NF-kappaB
      p65 proteins. The use of probiotic for 8 wk significantly ameliorated the
      inflammation by decreasing the colonic concentration of IL-6, expression of
      TNF-alpha and NF-kappaB p65, leukocyte recruitment, as demonstrated by a decrease
      in colonic MPO activity, and the level of fecal calprotectin compared to
      sulfasalazine group and the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Oral
      supplementation with probiotics could be helpful in maintaining remission and
      preventing relapse of UC.

TI  - Rectal administration of Lactobacillus casei DG modifies flora composition and
      Toll-like receptor expression in colonic mucosa of patients with mild ulcerative 
      colitis.
PG  - 1178-87
LID - 10.1007/s10620-010-1384-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: An imbalance in gut microbiota seems to contribute to the development
      of chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, such as
      ulcerative colitis (UC). Although it has been suggested that probiotic
      supplementation is an effective approach to colitis, its effects on intestinal
      flora and on mucosal cytokine balance have never been explored. AIM: To evaluate 
      the effect of Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) DG, a probiotic strain, on
      colonic-associated microbiota, mucosal cytokine balance, and toll-like receptor
      (TLR) expression. METHODS: Twenty-six patients with mild left-sided UC were
      randomly allocated to one of three groups for an 8-week treatment period: the
      first group of 7 patients received oral 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) alone, the 
      second group of 8 patients received oral 5-ASA plus oral L. casei DG, and the
      third group of 11 patients received oral 5-ASA and rectal L. casei DG. Biopsies
      were collected from the sigmoid region to culture mucosal-associated microbes and
      to assess cytokine and TLR messenger RNA (mRNA) levels by quantitative real-time 
      polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: 5-ASA alone or together with oral L.
      casei DG failed to affect colonic flora and TLR expression in a significant
      manner, but when coupled with rectally administered L. casei DG, it modified
      colonic microbiota by increasing Lactobacillus spp. and reducing
      Enterobacteriaceae. It also significantly reduced TLR-4 and interleukin
      (IL)-1beta mRNA levels and significantly increased mucosal IL-10. CONCLUSIONS:
      Manipulation of mucosal microbiota by L. casei DG and its effects on the mucosal 
      immune system seem to be required to mediate the beneficial activities of
      probiotics in UC patients.

LID - 10.1177/0884533610373773 [doi]
AB  - Nutrition interventions play a central role in the treatment and management of
      inflammatory bowel disease in children. Malnutrition is a common presenting
      symptom in both pediatric ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and is
      associated with increased morbidity. Providing macronutrients can improve growth;
      likewise, identifying and correcting micronutrient deficiencies can improve
      comorbid conditions like osteopenia and anemia. Although many patients manipulate
      their diets to help treat their inflammatory bowel disease, only parenteral
      nutrition with bowel rest and exclusive enteral nutrition therapy have been shown
      effective for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.

AB  - Cancer treatment regimens that include radiation therapy (RT) to the abdominal
      region for cervical, ovarian, prostate, sigmoid, or colorectal cancer potentially
      disturb the colonization resistance of the indigenous gut flora, causing
      RT-induced diarrhea, enteritis, and colitis in more than 80% of patients with
      cancer. One approach for the prevention of RT-induced diarrhea is the use of
      probiotics. Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy of probiotic
      preparations VSL #3 and Lactobacillus casei DN-114 001 in decreasing the
      incidence and grade of RT-induced diarrhea. Oncology nurses and advanced practice
      clinicians are in a position to interpret research findings related to RT-induced
      diarrhea, enteritis, and colitis and to apply evidence-based practice principles 
      in patients with cancer receiving RT to promote positive outcomes.

      Syndrome in humans.
PG  - 318-29

AB  - A micro-array has been developed, based on the GeneDisc(R) array, for the genetic
      identification of 12 O-types and 7 H-types of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia
      coli (STEC) including the most clinically relevant enterohemorrhagic E. coli
      (EHEC) serotypes. The genes selected for determination of the O antigens
      (rfbE(O157), wzx(O26), wzx(O103), wbd1(O111), ihp1(O145), wzx(O121), wzy(O113),
      wzy(O91), wzx(O104), wzy(O118), wzx(O45), and wbgN(O55)) and H-types (fliC(H2),
      fliC(H7), fliC(H8), fliC(H11), fliC(H19), fliC(H21), and fliC(H28)) showed a high
      specificity and concordance with serology. The micro-array also had a high
      specificity for EHEC-associated virulence factors, including Shiga toxins 1 and 2
      (stx1 and stx2), intimin (eae), enterohemolysin (ehxA), serine protease (espP),
      catalase peroxidase (katP), the type II secretion system (etpD), subtilase
      cytotoxin (subA), autoagglutinating adhesin (Saa) and type III secreted effectors
      encoded in the genomic islands OI-122 (ent/espL2, nleB, and nleE) and OI-71
      (nleF, nleH1-2, and nleA). The eae gene was detected in all typical EHEC strains,
      and the pattern of nle genes encoded in OI-71 and OI-122 was found to be closely 
      associated with certain serotypes of typical EHEC and emerging EHEC strains.
      Virulence plasmid associated genes such as katP, espP, and etpD were more common 
      in EHEC than in STEC strains; this supports their association with virulence.
      This array constitutes a valuable approach for the identification of STEC strains
      with a high potential for human virulence.

      pathogenesis of radiation-induced enteritis and colitis.
PG  - 285-94
LID - 10.1007/s10620-010-1307-1 [doi]
AB  - Radiation therapy has become one of the most important treatment modalities for
      human malignancy, but certain immediate and delayed side-effects on the normal
      surrounding tissues limit the amount of effective radiation that can be
      administered. After exposure of the abdominal region to ionizing radiation,
      nearly all patients experience transient symptoms of irradiation of the bowel.
      Acute-phase symptoms may persist for a short time, yet long-term complications
      can represent significant clinical conditions with high morbidity. Data from both
      experimental studies and clinical trials suggest the potential benefit for
      probiotics in radiation-induced enteritis and colitis. On the other hand, it is
      well evidenced that both useful and harmful effects of therapeutic applications
      of ionizing radiation upon living systems are ascribed to free-radical
      production. Therefore, the hypothesis that probiotics reinforce antioxidant
      defense systems of normal mucosal cells exposed to ionizing radiation may explain
      to an extent their beneficial action. The aim of this review is threefold: First,
      to make a short brief into the natural history of radiation injury to the
      intestinal tract. Second, to describe the primary interaction of ionizing
      radiation at the cellular level and demonstrate the participation of free
      radicals in the mechanisms of injury and, third, to try a more profound
      investigation into the antioxidant abilities of probiotics and prebiotics based
      on the available experimental and clinical data.

TI  - Changes in colon gene expression associated with increased colon inflammation in 
      interleukin-10 gene-deficient mice inoculated with Enterococcus species.
PG  - 39
LID - 10.1186/1471-2172-11-39 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inappropriate responses to normal intestinal bacteria may be involved
      in the development of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD, e.g. Crohn's Disease
      (CD), Ulcerative Colitis (UC)) and variations in the host genome may mediate this
      process. IL-10 gene-deficient (Il10-/-) mice develop CD-like colitis mainly in
      the colon, in part due to inappropriate responses to normal intestinal bacteria
      including Enterococcus strains, and have therefore been used as an animal model
      of CD. Comprehensive characterization of changes in cecum gene expression levels 
      associated with inflammation in the Il10-/- mouse model has recently been
      reported. Our aim was to characterize changes in colonic gene expression levels
      in Il10-/- and C57BL/6J (C57; control) mice resulting from oral bacterial
      inoculation with 12 Enterococcus faecalis and faecium (EF) strains isolated from 
      calves or poultry, complex intestinal flora (CIF) collected from healthy control 
      mice, or a mixture of the two (EF.CIF). We investigated two hypotheses: (1) that 
      oral inoculation of Il10-/- mice would result in greater and more consistent
      intestinal inflammation than that observed in Il10-/- mice not receiving this
      inoculation, and (2) that this inflammation would be associated with changes in
      colon gene expression levels similar to those previously observed in human
      studies, and these mice would therefore be an appropriate model for human CD.
      RESULTS: At 12 weeks of age, total RNA extracted from intact colon was hybridized
      to Agilent 44 k mouse arrays. Differentially expressed genes were identified
      using linear models for microarray analysis (Bioconductor), and these genes were 
      clustered using GeneSpring GX and Ingenuity Pathways Analysis software.
      Intestinal inflammation was increased in Il10-/- mice as a result of inoculation,
      with the strongest effect being in the EF and EF.CIF groups. Genes differentially
      expressed in Il10-/- mice as a result of EF or EF.CIF inoculation were associated
      with the following pathways: inflammatory disease (111 genes differentially
      expressed), immune response (209 genes), antigen presentation (11 genes,
      particularly major histocompatability complex Class II), fatty acid metabolism
      (30 genes) and detoxification (31 genes). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that
      colonic inflammation in Il10-/- mice inoculated with solutions containing
      Enterococcus strains is associated with gene expression changes similar to those 
      of human IBD, specifically CD, and that with the EF.CIF inoculum in particular
      this is an appropriate model to investigate food-gene interactions relevant to
      human CD.

PG  - 250-6
LID - 10.1177/0884533610368708 [doi]
AB  - Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis has become the
      surgical treatment of choice for patients with ulcerative colitis and familial
      polyposis coli syndromes. Pouch construction uses the distal 30-40 cm of ileum,
      and there exists a potential for postoperative nutrition consequences. These
      include vitamin B(12) deficiency, iron deficiency, bile acid malabsorption, and
      abnormalities of trace elements, fluids, and electrolytes. Patients who have
      undergone an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis procedure often describe specific food 
      sensitivities that may require diet alteration, even more so than do patients
      with permanent ileostomy. There may be roles for postoperative probiotic
      supplementation in an attempt to decrease the rate of "pouchitis" and appropriate
      preoperative nutrition support to minimize the risk of perioperative
      complications.

PG  - 347-57
LID - 10.1007/s12275-010-9228-4 [doi]
AB  - Escherichia coli O157:H7, a food-borne pathogen, causes hemorrhagic colitis and
      the hemolytic-uremic syndrome. A putative virulence factor of E. coli O157:H7 is 
      a 60-MDa plasmid (pO157) found in 99% of all clinical isolates and many
      bovine-derived strains. The well characterized E. coli O157:H7 Sakai strain
      (Sakai) and its pO157-cured derivative (Sakai-Cu) were compared for phenotypic
      differences. Sakai-Cu had enhanced survival in synthetic gastric fluid, did not
      colonize cattle as well as wild-type Sakai, and had unchanged growth rates and
      tolerance to salt and heat. These results are consistent with our previous
      findings with another E. coli O157:H7 disease outbreak isolate ATCC 43894 and its
      pO157-cured (43894-Cu). However, despite the essentially sequence identical pO157
      in these strains, Sakai-Cu had changes in antibiotic susceptibility and motility 
      that did not occur in the 43894-Cu strain. This unexpected result was
      systematically analyzed using phenotypic microarrays testing 1,920 conditions
      with Sakai, 43894, and the plasmid-cured mutants. The influence of the pO157
      differed between strains on a wide number of growth/survival conditions. Relative
      expression of genes related to acid resistance (gadA, gadX, and rpoS) and
      flagella production (fliC and flhD) were tested using quantitative real-time PCR 
      and gadA and rpoS expression differed between Sakai-Cu and 43894-Cu. The
      strain-specific differences in phenotype that resulted from the loss of
      essentially DNA-sequence identical pO157 were likely due to the chromosomal
      genetic diversity between strains. The O157:H7 serotype diversity was further
      highlighted by phenotypic microarray comparisons of the two outbreak strains with
      a genotype 6 bovine E. coli O157:H7 isolate, rarely associated with human
      disease.

AB  - AIM: The aim of our study was to analyse cytokine composition of human milk and
      its relationship to the development of eosinophilic colitis (EC). METHODS:
      Cytokines were measured by ELISA method in breast milk of 20 mothers of infants
      who developed EC and 20 controls. RESULTS: We found significantly higher
      concentrations of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) (Th1 cytokine) in breast milk
      received by EC infants compared to controls (p = 0.0004). In contrary, IL-18
      (Th1-inducing cytokine) was significantly higher in breast milk received by
      healthy infants comparing to EC infants (p = 0.001). Regulatory cytokine
      transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) showed higher concentrations in
      breast milk received by healthy infants, although the difference from EC group
      was not significant (p = 0.072). CONCLUSION: The results of our study showed that
      infants with EC were receiving breast milk with a possibly risky cytokine pattern
      indicating cytokine imbalance, impaired immunoregulation and the early Th1 shift.

PG  - S6-9
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0b013e3181dd8b76 [doi]
AB  - Nutrition-related factors together with components of the gut-associated
      microbial ecosystem (gut microbiota) emerge as prime environmental triggers for
      the development and modification of lifestyle-related chronic diseases including 
      chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastro-intestinal tract such as Crohn's
      disease and ulcerative colitis. Although a variety of susceptibility genes were
      identified in genome-wide association studies, the impact of environmental
      factors in initiating or promoting the development of these complex diseases are 
      unknown. Nutrigenomics is a transdisciplinary approach to understand the subtle
      but contentious impact of nutrition and/or microbes as prime environmental
      triggers in shaping the dynamic range between health and diseases. Profiling
      technologies such as transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabonomics at the
      interface of the host's genetic make-up and its metabolic phenotype are
      implemented to identify cellular and molecular targets to develop novel
      hypothesise with respect to the functional role of diet and gut bacteria in
      modulating chronic degenerative diseases including inflammatory bowel disease.

      intestinal inflammatory activity and remission.
PG  - 49-55
LID - S0004-28032010000100009 [pii]
AB  - CONTEXT: Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory bowel disease involving
      superficial inflammation of the mucosa of the colon, rectum, and anus, sometimes 
      including the terminal ileum. When in clinical activity, the disease is
      characterized by various daily evacuations containing blood, mucus and/or pus
      alternating periods of remission. OBJECTIVE: To compare nutritional parameters
      (dietary, biochemical and anthropometric) among patients with ulcerative colitis 
      followed up on an outpatient basis over a period of 1 year and during periods of 
      intestinal inflammatory activity and remission. METHODS: Sixty-five patients were
      studied over a period of 1 year and divided into two groups: group 1 with
      inflammatory disease activity (n = 24), and group 2 without disease activity (n =
      41). Anthropometric measures, biochemical parameters, quantitative food intake,
      and qualitative food frequency were analyzed. RESULTS: A significant reduction in
      body mass index and weight and in the intake of energy, proteins, lipids,
      calcium, iron and phosphorus was observed in the group with inflammatory activity
      (group 1) when compared to the period of clinical remission. The most affected
      food groups were cereals, legumes, oils, and fats. In contrast, in group 2
      significant differences in triceps and sub scapular skin fold thickness, total
      protein, hemoglobin and hematocrit were observed between the first and final
      visit. Calcium and vitamin B6 intake, as well as the consumption of legumes, meat
      and eggs, and sugar and sweets, was significantly higher than on the first visit.
      CONCLUSION: Patients with ulcerative colitis followed up on an outpatient basis
      tend to be well nourished. However, the nutritional aspects studied tend to
      worsen during the period of inflammatory disease activity.

TI  - Treatment of relapsing mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis with the probiotic
      VSL#3 as adjunctive to a standard pharmaceutical treatment: a double-blind,
      randomized, placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 2218-27
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2010.218 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: VSL#3 is a high-potency probiotic mixture that has been used
      successfully in the treatment of pouchitis. The primary end point of the study
      was to assess the effects of supplementation with VSL#3 in patients affected by
      relapsing ulcerative colitis (UC) who are already under treatment with
      5-aminosalicylic acid (ASA) and/or immunosuppressants at stable doses. METHODS: A
      total of 144 consecutive patients were randomly treated for 8 weeks with VSL#3 at
      a dose of 3,600 billion CFU/day (71 patients) or with placebo (73 patients).
      RESULTS: In all, 65 patients in the VSL#3 group and 66 patients in the placebo
      group completed the study. The decrease in ulcerative colitis disease activity
      index (UCDAI) scores of 50% or more was higher in the VSL#3 group than in the
      placebo group (63.1 vs. 40.8; per protocol (PP) P=0.010, confidence interval
      (CI)(9)(5)(%) 0.51-0.74; intention to treat (ITT) P=0.031, CI(9)(5)(%)
      0.47-0.69). Significant results with VSL#3 were recorded in an improvement of
      three points or more in the UCDAI score (60.5% vs. 41.4%; PP P=0.017, CI(9)(5)(%)
      0.51-0.74; ITT P=0.046, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.47-0.69) and in rectal bleeding (PP
      P=0.014, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.46-0.70; ITT P=0.036, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.41-0.65), whereas
      stool frequency (PP P=0.202, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.39-0.63; ITT P=0.229, CI(9)(5)(%)
      0.35-0.57), physician's rate of disease activity (PP P=0.088, CI(9)(5)(%)
      0.34-0.58; ITT P=0.168, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.31-0.53), and endoscopic scores (PP
      P=0.086, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.74-0.92; ITT P=0.366, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.66-0.86) did not show 
      statistical differences. Remission was higher in the VSL#3 group than in the
      placebo group (47.7% vs. 32.4%; PP P=0.069, CI(9)(5)(%) 0.36-0.60; ITT P=0.132,
      CI(9)(5)(%) 0.33-0.56). Eight patients on VSL#3 (11.2%) and nine patients on
      placebo (12.3%) reported mild side effects. CONCLUSIONS: VSL#3 supplementation is
      safe and able to reduce UCDAI scores in patients affected by relapsing
      mild-to-moderate UC who are under treatment with 5-ASA and/or immunosuppressants.
      Moreover, VSL#3 improves rectal bleeding and seems to reinduce remission in
      relapsing UC patients after 8 weeks of treatment, although these parameters do
      not reach statistical significance.

AB  - Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders (EGIDs) are a diverse group of disorders 
      whose diagnosis is on the rise and are characterized by symptoms caused by
      infiltration by eosinophils of the different sections of the digestive tract.
      Although little is known of their etiology, it seems to be multifactorial.
      Alteration of the immunological capacity of the digestive mucosa is determined by
      the exposure of genetically predisposed individuals to potential airborne or food
      allergens. EGIDs are classified based on the location of the inflammatory
      response even though their symptoms, prognosis, and treatment vary considerably. 
      Eosinophilic esophagitis is the most widely recognized entity in this family and 
      is characterized by exclusive eosinophilic infiltration of the esophagus.
      Breakthroughs in understanding its etiopathogeny have been extrapolated to
      eosinophilic gastroenteritis, a rare disease identified many years ago commonly
      involving the stomach and small bowel which should be distinguished from
      hypereosinophilic syndrome. Eosinophilic colitis, which usually affects children,
      could be considered a specific non-IgE-mediated allergy to food protein. The
      physiopathological bases of these entities need to be established in order to
      define specific treatment aimed at preventing and altering their clinical
      evolution.

PG  - G999-G1008
AB  - Angiogenesis is required for wound healing and repair, but dysregulated
      angiogenesis is involved in gastrointestinal inflammation. Bacillus
      polyfermenticus (B.P.) is a probiotic bacterium clinically used for a variety of 
      intestinal disorders in East Asia. Here we investigated the effect of B.P. on
      angiogenesis of human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells (HIMECs) and
      wound healing in intestinal mucosa. Exposure of HIMECs to the conditioned medium 
      of B.P. cultures (B.P. CM) increased cell migration, permeability, and tube
      formation. Production of the proangiogenic cytokine IL-8 was increased by B.P.
      CM, and neutralizing antibodies against IL-8 or IL-8 receptor CXCR2 reduced tube 
      formation as well as actin stress fiber formation. B.P. CM also increased
      NF-kappaB activation, and inhibitors of NF-kappaB suppressed B.P. CM-induced tube
      formation and IL-8 production. Furthermore, B.P. facilitated recovery of mice
      from colitis as shown by increased body weight and reduced rectal bleeding and
      histological severity. B.P. also increased angiogenesis and mouse IL-8 production
      in the mucosal layer. Collectively, these results show that B.P. increases
      angiogenesis of HIMECs in a NF-kappaB/IL-8/CXCR2-dependent manner. Moreover, B.P.
      promotes angiogenesis in the mucosa during recovery of mice from colitis,
      suggesting that this probiotic may be clinically used to facilitate intestinal
      wound healing.

TI  - Low occurrence of Clostridium difficile in fecal samples of healthy calves and
      pigs at slaughter and in minced meat in Switzerland.
PG  - 973-5
AB  - Clostridium difficile is a cause of diarrhea and colitis in humans. The increase 
      of incidence and severity of C. difficile infections in humans in past years is
      due, at least in part, to the emergence of more virulent strains (PCR ribotypes
      027 and 078). Recent studies describe the occurrence of hypervirulent strains in 
      ground meat products. Therefore, food animals and food need to be assessed for
      their possible role as vectors of C. difficile to humans. In this pilot study,
      fecal samples of 204 calves and 165 pigs, as well as 46 minced meat products were
      investigated to determine the occurrence of C. difficile in farm animals at
      slaughter and in ground meat products at the retail level in Switzerland. C.
      difficile was isolated from only one fecal sample of a calf. All samples from
      pigs and ground meat were negative. Further characterization revealed that the
      isolated strain harbored genes for toxins A and B as well as binary toxin, and
      belonged to the ribotype 078. Based on these results, low occurrence of C.
      difficile in farm animals at slaughter and retail ground meat in Switzerland is
      postulated. However, further studies are necessary to confirm these preliminary
      data and to assess future trends.

PG  - 377-83

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin D has immune-regulatory functions in experimental colitis,
      and low vitamin D levels are present in Crohn's disease. AIM: To assess the
      effectiveness of vitamin D3 treatment in Crohn's disease with regard to improved 
      disease course. METHODS: We performed a randomized double-blind
      placebo-controlled trial to assess the benefits of oral vitamin D3 treatment in
      Crohn's disease. We included 108 patients with Crohn's disease in remission, of
      which fourteen were excluded later. Patients were randomized to receive either
      1200 IU vitamin D3 (n = 46) or placebo (n = 48) once daily during 12 months. The 
      primary endpoint was clinical relapse. RESULTS: Oral vitamin D3 treatment with
      1200 IU daily increased serum 25OHD from mean 69 nmol/L [standard deviation
      (s.d.) 31 nmol/L] to mean 96 nmol/L (s.d. 27 nmol/L) after 3 months (P < 0.001). 
      The relapse rate was lower among patients treated with vitamin D3 (6/46 or 13%)
      than among patients treated with placebo (14/48 or 29%), (P = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS:
      Oral supplementation with 1200 IE vitamin D3 significantly increased serum
      vitamin D levels and insignificantly reduced the risk of relapse from 29% to 13%,
      (P = 0.06). Given that vitamin D3 treatment might be effective in Crohn's
      disease, we suggest larger studies to elucidate this matter further.

TI  - Anti-TNF therapy in inflammatory bowel diseases: a huge review.
PG  - 233-43
AB  - Anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) agents have changed the way of treating
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) refractory to conventional medications
      (corticosteroids, immu-nomodulators). Infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab
      are more effective than placebo for induction and maintenance of remission in
      luminal Crohn's disease. Infliximab and adalimumab are also effective for
      maintenance of fistula closure in Crohn's disease. Only infliximab is Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for ulcerative colitis. Only adalimumab has
      demonstrated its efficacy in a randomized controlled trial to induce remission
      after infliximab failure in Crohn's disease. Anti-TNF therapy leads to mucosal
      healing, reduces hospitalizations and surgeries, and improves patients' quality
      of life. Safety data indicate that serious infections occur in 2-4% of patients
      treated with anti-TNF therapy, with no statistical difference when compared to
      controls. The risk of rare events such as malignancies and lymphoma, in IBD
      patients treated with anti-TNF agents, will require a longer duration of
      follow-up. Currently, the risk-benefit ratio of anti-TNF therapy supports its use
      in IBD. Several questions remain to be answered: can an indiscriminate use of
      anti-TNF agents modify the natural course of the disease, should mucosal healing 
      be used in clinical practice, and should anti-TNF therapy be used alone or in
      combination with immunomodulators in the long-term?

TI  - Effect of butyrate enemas on inflammation and antioxidant status in the colonic
      mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis in remission.
PG  - 738-44
LID - 10.1016/j.clnu.2010.04.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Butyrate, produced by colonic fermentation of dietary fibers
      is often hypothesized to beneficially affect colonic health. This study aims to
      assess the effects of butyrate on inflammation and oxidative stress in subjects
      with chronically mildly elevated parameters of inflammation and oxidative stress.
      METHODS: Thirty-five patients with ulcerative colitis in clinical remission daily
      administered 60 ml rectal enemas containing 100mM sodium butyrate (n=17) or
      saline (n=18) during 20 days (NCT00696098). Before and after the intervention
      feces, blood and colonic mucosal biopsies were obtained. Parameters of
      antioxidant defense and oxidative damage, myeloperoxidase, several cytokines,
      fecal calprotectin and CRP were determined. RESULTS: Butyrate enemas induced
      minor effects on colonic inflammation and oxidative stress. Only a significant
      increase of the colonic IL-10/IL-12 ratio was found within butyrate-treated
      patients (p=0.02), and colonic concentrations of CCL5 were increased after
      butyrate compared to placebo treatment (p=0.03). Although in general butyrate did
      not affect colonic glutathione levels, the effects of butyrate enemas on total
      colonic glutathione appeared to be dependent on the level of inflammation.
      CONCLUSION: Although UC patients in remission were characterized by low-grade
      oxidative stress and inflammation, rectal butyrate enemas showed only minor
      effects on inflammatory and oxidative stress parameters.

TI  - Some food-associated mycotoxins as potential risk factors in humans predisposed
      to chronic intestinal inflammatory diseases.
PG  - 282-94
LID - 10.1016/j.toxicon.2010.04.016 [doi]
AB  - Mycotoxins are fungal metabolites able to affect the functions of numerous
      tissues and organs in animals and humans, including intestinal and immune
      systems. However, the potential link between exposure to some mycotoxins and
      human chronic intestinal inflammatory diseases, such as celiac and Crohn's
      diseases or ulcerative colitis, has not been investigated. Instead, several
      theories based on bacterial, immunological or neurological events have been
      elaborated to explain the etiology of these pathologies. Here we reviewed the
      literature on mycotoxin-induced intestinal dysfunctions and compared these
      perturbations to the impairments of intestinal functions typically observed in
      human chronic intestinal inflammatory diseases. Converging evidence based on
      various cellular and animal studies show that several mycotoxins induce
      intestinal alterations that are similar to those observed at the onset and during
      the progression of inflammatory bowel diseases. Although epidemiologic evidence
      is still required, existing data are sufficient to suspect a role of some
      food-associated mycotoxins in the induction and/or persistence of human chronic
      intestinal inflammatory diseases in genetically predisposed patients.

LID - 10.1097/MEG.0b013e32833a6ca0 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The colonic mucus layer plays an important role in the protection
      of the intestinal epithelium and mainly consists of mucin glycoproteins
      (primarily MUC2 in the colon) trefoil factor 3 (TFF3) and secretory IgA. Butyrate
      is a major end product of fermentation of dietary fibres and is associated with
      beneficial effects on colonic health. Earlier in-vitro and animal studies showed 
      that butyrate modulates MUC2 and TFF3 expression and mucin secretion, although
      data from human studies are not yet available. METHODS: Sixteen healthy
      volunteers and 35 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients in clinical remission
      self-administered a 60 ml rectal enema containing 100 mmol/l butyrate or placebo 
      once daily for 2 and 3 weeks, respectively. After each treatment, biopsies were
      taken from the distal sigmoid for quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemical
      analysis of MUC2 and TFF3. In addition, mucosal sections were stained with high
      iron diamine-alcian blue to distinguish between sialomucins and sulphomucins. To 
      analyse total mucin secretion and secretory IgA concentrations, 24 h faeces were 
      collected during the day before the endoscopic examination. RESULTS: The butyrate
      intervention did not significantly modulate the expression of MUC2 (fold change: 
      1.04 and 1.05 in healthy volunteers and ulcerative colitis patients,
      respectively) or TFF3 (fold change: 0.91 and 0.94 in healthy volunteers and UC
      patients, respectively). Furthermore, the percentage of sialomucins, mucus
      secretion and secretory IgA concentrations were not affected by the butyrate
      intervention in both the groups. CONCLUSION: Butyrate exposure in healthy
      volunteers and UC patients in remission did not affect the measured parameters of
      the colonic mucus layer.

TI  - Probiotic properties of non-conventional lactic acid bacteria: immunomodulation
      by Oenococcus oeni.
PG  - 136-45
LID - 10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2010.04.007 [doi]
AB  - The widely used probiotic bacteria belong to the genera Lactobacillus and
      Bifidobacterium and have in most cases been isolated from the human
      gastrointestinal tract. However, other "less conventional" bacteria, from
      allochthonous or extremophilic origin, sharing similar structural or functional
      features, may also confer specific health benefits to a host. Firstly, we
      explored the in vitro immuno-modulatory or immune-stimulatory activities of 25
      wine lactic acid bacteria belonging to Oenococcus oeni and Pediococcus parvulus. 
      While cytokines released by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) stimulated
      by P. parvulus strains, showed little variation, O. oeni strains induced
      strain-specific cytokine patterns. Some O. oeni strains were then further
      analyzed under various conditions for growth, dose and culture medium. In a
      second phase, we evaluated the oral tolerance and safety of two strains of O.
      oeni in mice fed a high dose of bacteria for a week. Finally, evidence was
      gathered on the in vivo anti-inflammatory potential of a selected O. oeni strain 
      using an experimental 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis 
      mouse model. Although results did not match the anti-inflammatory levels obtained
      with certain conventional probiotics, strain IOEB 9115 significantly lowered
      colonic injury and alleviated colitis symptoms. The 'natural' tolerance towards
      acid, ethanol, and phenolic compounds of O. oeni strains combined with a
      measureable immunomodulatory potential, suggest a possible use of selected
      strains isolated from wine as live probiotics.

      Lactobacillus casei BL23 strain attenuates DSS colitis in mice.
PG  - 35-41
LID - 10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2010.03.037 [doi]
AB  - Human immune cells release large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as
      superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide via respiratory burst. In inflammatory
      bowel diseases, a sustained and abnormal activation of the immune response
      results in oxidative stress of the digestive tract and in a loss of intestinal
      homeostasis. We previously reported that heterologous production of the
      Lactobacillus plantarum manganese catalase (MnKat) enhances the survival of Lb.
      casei BL23 when exposed to oxidative stress. Anti-inflammatory effects were
      observed after Lb. casei BL23 oral administrations in moderate murine dextran
      sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis, without added effects of the MnKat
      production. Here, we evaluated the protective effects obtained by an improved
      antioxidative strategy. The Lactococcus lactis sodA gene was expressed in Lb.
      casei BL23 which acquired an efficient manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD)
      activity. The effects of Lb. casei MnSOD alone or in combination with Lb. casei
      MnKat were compared first in eukaryotic cell PMA-induced oxidative stress model
      and then in severe murine DSS-induced colitis. Based on ROS production assays as 
      well as colonic histological scores, a significant reduction of both oxidative
      stress and inflammation was observed with Lb. casei MnSOD either alone or in
      combination with Lb. casei MnKat. No added effect of the presence of Lb. casei
      MnKat was observed. These results suggest that Lb. casei BL23 MnSOD could have
      anti-inflammatory effects on gut inflammation.

PG  - 181-92
LID - S0212-16112010000200001 [pii]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease is an entity with not wellknown pathogenesis, and
      important nutritional and metabolic implications because of the high prevalence
      of malnutrition, the possible implication of dietary factors in its pathogenesis 
      and because of the hypothesis that nutritional intervention could be a primary
      treatment for the disease. Some nutrients could induce a low antigenic stimuli,
      regulate inflammatory and immunological responses and stimulate intestinal
      mucosal trophism. Present available evidence supports enteral nutrition in
      Crohn's disease as a primary treatment if treatment with steroids is not possible
      (failure or contraindication) (grade of recommendation A) or either combined
      treatment with drugs in malnourished patients or those with inflammatory bowel
      stenosis. In those patients with sustained clinical remission, no benefit of
      either enteral nutrition or supplements in the absence of nutritional deficits
      has been shown. Elemental or modified formula (glutamine, omega 3 fatty acids)
      could not be recommended. In ulcerative colitis, nutritional influence over the
      activity of the disease has not been shown, although there are some promising
      results regarding enteric coated W3 fatty acids and a possible role for
      probiotics. In the treatment and prevention of pouchitis, there could be a role
      for probiotics (VSL#3). Nutritional treatment should be considered an integral
      component in the Management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Probiotic yeasts: anti-inflammatory potential of various non-pathogenic strains
      in experimental colitis in mice.
PG  - 2134-45
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the in vitro immunomodulation capacity of various non-pathogenic
      yeast strains and to investigate the ability of some of these food grade yeasts
      to prevent experimental colitis in mice. METHODS: In vitro immunomodulation was
      assessed by measuring cytokines [interleukin (IL)-12p70, IL-10, tumor necrosis
      factor and interferon gamma] released by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      after 24 h stimulation with 6 live yeast strains (Saccharomyces ssp.) and with
      bacterial reference strains. A murine model of acute 2-4-6-trinitrobenzene
      sulfonic acid (TNBS)-colitis was next used to evaluate the distinct prophylactic 
      protective capacities of three yeast strains compared with the performance of
      prednisolone treatment. RESULTS: The six yeast strains all showed similar
      non-discriminating anti-inflammatory potential when tested on immunocompetent
      cells in vitro. However, although they exhibited similar colonization patterns in
      vivo, some yeast strains showed significant anti-inflammatory activities in the
      TNBS-induced colitis model, whereas others had weaker or no preventive effect at 
      all, as evidenced by colitis markers (body-weight loss, macroscopic and
      histological scores, myeloperoxidase activities and blood inflammatory markers). 
      CONCLUSION: A careful selection of strains is required among the biodiversity of 
      yeasts for specific clinical studies, including applications in inflammatory
      bowel disease and other therapeutic uses.

      transcriptome analysis.
PG  - S62-74
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.200900543 [doi]
AB  - Increased levels of n-6 arachidonic acid (AA), a precursor of pro-inflammatory
      eicosanoids, have been found in the colon mucosa of inflammatory bowel disease
      patients when compared with healthy subjects. The hypothesis was that dietary AA 
      would aggravate colon inflammation by changing expression of genes in
      inflammatory signaling pathways. AA-enriched diet was fed to IL10 gene-deficient 
      (Il10-/-) mice, model of a inflammatory bowel disease, and compared with Il10-/- 
      mice fed an oleic acid control diet. Effects of AA on gene expression profiles
      during colitis were examined using whole genome microarray analysis. Dietary AA
      decreased the expression levels of some colonic genes in ER stress, complement
      system, nuclear respiratory factor 2-mediated oxidative stress and positive acute
      phase response pathways compared with Il10-/- mice fed an oleic acid diet. AA
      increased the expression levels of fatty acid catabolism genes, but decreased
      that of lipid synthesis genes during colitis, likely by sterol regulatory element
      binding transcription factor 1 and target gene regulation. A link has been
      suggested between AA and reduction of intestinal fibrosis by down-regulating the 
      expression levels of pro-inflammatory and fibrotic marker genes. Contrary to the 
      hypothesis, these findings suggest that dietary AA, in the present experimental
      conditions, is not pro-inflammatory, reduces ER stress and protects colonocytes
      from oxidative stress in Il10-/- mice.

TI  - [Chronic inflammatory bowel disease: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis].
PG  - 1-9
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases comprise Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and
      indeterminate colitis, generally beginning in young subjects and increasing in
      frequency in Western countries. Despite their still unknown aetiologies, some
      pathogenic mechanisms have been elucidated after the recent discovery of numerous
      susceptibility genes and rare environmental factors. These diseases have a course
      consisting of episodes of flare-up alternating with periods of remission. Medical
      treatment for induction of a remission comprises besides aminosalicylates,
      corticosteroids including budesonide and immunosuppressive drugs, anti-TNF-alpha 
      drugs (infliximab, adalimumab) indicated in case of failure of previous
      therapies. Surgery is indicated for complications and failure of medical
      treatment.With current therapy, most of the patients are able to fulfil their
      familial, social and professional projects.

TI  - Food allergy and eosinophilic gastroenteritis and colitis.
PG  - 238-45
LID - 10.1097/ACI.0b013e32833982c3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EGE) and eosinophilic colitis
      (ECO) are two forms of chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal
      tract characterized by eosinophil accumulation in the mucosa or in deeper layers 
      of the gastrointestinal wall and associated with atopic disease. The eosinophilic
      gastrointestinal diseases broadened the spectrum of atopic gastrointestinal
      disorders formerly restricted to food allergy manifestating at the
      gastrointestinal mucosa. Their awareness increased enormously; therefore, we will
      review current knowledge about atopic gastrointestinal diseases for the
      allergologist. RECENT FINDINGS: Major attention will be drawn to the differential
      diagnosis, because symptoms of atopic gastrointestinal diseases frequently mimic 
      those of other chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) or irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS), although the diseases are distinct in their histopathology, gene 
      expression signature, response to therapy, and association with allergies. The
      pathogenesis of EGE and ECO will be described that involves environmental and
      genetic factors, particularly food antigens and expression level of interleukin
      (IL)-5 and selective chemokines. SUMMARY: Understanding symptoms and pathology of
      such disease is the basis of a rational treatment based on reduced exposure to
      offending food antigens as well as anti-inflammatory therapy. Atopic
      gastrointestinal diseases are in many cases reversible; however, chronic
      treatment is often necessary to prevent relapse.

PG  - 13
LID - 10.1186/1472-6882-10-13 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics are effective in inflammatory bowel diseases. Clinical
      effectiveness and dose dependency of E. coli Nissle (EcN) enemas were
      investigated in ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: In a double-blind study, 90
      patients with moderate distal activity in UC were randomly assigned to treatment 
      with either 40, 20, or 10 ml enemas (N = 24, 23, 23) containing 10E8 EcN/ml or
      placebo (N = 20). The study medication was taken once daily for at least 2 weeks.
      After 2, 4 and/or 8 weeks the clinical DAI was assessed together with tolerance
      to treatment. Patients who reached clinical DAI <or= 2 within that time were
      regarded as responders. RESULTS: According to ITT analysis the number of
      responders was not significantly higher in the EcN group than in the placebo
      group (p = 0.4430, 2-sided). However, the Jonckheere-Terpstra rank correlation
      for dose-dependent efficacy indicated a significant correlation of per-protocol
      responder rates (p = 0.0446, 2-sided). Time to remission was shortest with EcN 40
      ml, followed by EcN 20 ml. The number of adverse events did not differ notably.
      CONCLUSION: In contrast to ITT analysis, efficacy of rectal EcN application was
      significant in PP and points to EcN as a well tolerated treatment alternative in 
      moderate distal UC. TRIAL REGISTRATION: German Clinical Trials Register

TI  - Remission induction and maintenance effect of probiotics on ulcerative colitis: a
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 1908-15
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the induction of remission and maintenance effects of probiotics
      for ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Information was retrieved from MEDLINE, EMBASE, 
      and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. The induction of remission and
      promotion of maintenance were compared between probiotics treatment and
      non-probiotics treatment in ulcerative colitis. RESULTS: Thirteen randomized
      controlled studies met the selection criteria. Seven studies evaluated the
      remission rate, and eight studies estimated the recurrence rate; two studies
      evaluated both remission and recurrence rates. Compared with the non-probiotics
      group, the remission rate for ulcerative colitis patients who received probiotics
      was 1.35 (95% CI: 0.98-1.85). Compared with the placebo group, the remission rate
      of ulcerative colitis who received probiotics was 2.00 (95% CI: 1.35-2.96).
      During the course of treatment, in patients who received probiotics for less than
      12 mo compared with the group treated by non-probiotics, the remission rate of
      ulcerative colitis was 1.36 (95% CI: 1.07-1.73). Compared with the non-probiotics
      group, the recurrence rate of ulcerative colitis patients who received probiotics
      was 0.69 (95% CI: 2.47-1.01). In the mild to moderate group who received
      probiotics, compared to the group who did not receive probiotics, the recurrence 
      rate was 0.25 (95% CI: 0.12-0.51). The group who received Bifidobacterium bifidum
      treatment had a recurrence rate of 0.25 (95% CI: 0.12-0.50) compared with the
      non-probiotics group. CONCLUSION: Probiotic treatment was more effective than
      placebo in maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Update on the role of probiotics in the therapy of pediatric inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 47-54
AB  - Probiotics have had many applications in the past few years, and inflammatory
      conditions of the GI tract--including chronic disorders such as inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD)--have received the most attention by investigators. In fact, 
      the experimental basis to expect clinical efficacy of probiotics in IBD is quite 
      robust. In spite of this however, only minimal evidence of benefit by any
      probiotic is currently available in Crohn's disease, either in adult or in
      pediatric populations. In ulcerative colitis, on the other hand, several
      probiotic formulations and especially the proprietary preparation VSL#3 (a
      high-concentration mixture) have been found effective as adjuvant therapy, both
      in inducing and maintaining remission.

TI  - Role of the gut microbiota in defining human health.
PG  - 435-54
LID - 10.1586/eri.10.14 [doi]
AB  - The human superorganism is a conglomerate of mammalian and microbial cells, with 
      the latter estimated to outnumber the former by ten to one and the microbial
      genetic repertoire (microbiome) to be approximately 100-times greater than that
      of the human host. Given the ability of the immune response to rapidly counter
      infectious agents, it is striking that such a large density of microbes can exist
      in a state of synergy within the human host. This is particularly true of the
      distal gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which houses up to 1000 distinct bacterial
      species and an estimated excess of 1 x 10(14) microorganisms. An ever-increasing 
      body of evidence implicates the GI microbiota in defining states of health and
      disease. Here, we review the literature in adult and pediatric GI microbiome
      studies, the emerging links between microbial community structure, function,
      infection and disease, and the approaches to manipulate this crucial ecosystem to
      improve host health.

PG  - 202-5
AB  - The most common cause of ischemic colitis (IC) is a sudden and transient
      reduction in splanchnic perfusion. In the younger population, medications are an 
      increasingly recognized cause of ischemic bowel disease. Over-the-counter
      supplements may also lead to the development of ischemic colitis through similar 
      effects. We present a case of ischemic colitis in a 42-year-old active duty
      service member after using the performance-enhancing supplement, NO-Xplode. In
      this report, we review the pharmacology of this supplement and its proposed
      mechanism of injury.

TI  - Genome-wide transposon mutagenesis reveals a role for pO157 genes in biofilm
      development in Escherichia coli O157:H7 EDL933.
PG  - 2377-84
LID - 10.1128/IAI.00156-10 [doi]
AB  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7, a world-wide human food-borne
      pathogen, causes mild to severe diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, and hemolytic
      uremic syndrome. The ability of this pathogen to persist in the environment
      contributes to its dissemination to a wide range of foods and food processing
      surfaces. Biofilms are thought to be involved in persistence, but the process of 
      biofilm formation is complex and poorly understood in E. coli O157:H7. To better 
      understand the genetics of this process, a mini-Tn5 transposon insertion library 
      was constructed in strain EDL933 and screened for biofilm-negative mutants using 
      a microtiter plate assay. Ninety-five of 11,000 independent insertions (0.86%)
      were biofilm negative, and transposon insertions were located in 51 distinct
      genes/intergenic regions that must be involved either directly or indirectly in
      biofilm formation. All of the 51 biofilm-negative mutants showed reduced biofilm 
      formation on both hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces. Thirty-six genes were
      unique to this study, including genes on the virulence plasmid pO157. The type V 
      secreted autotransporter serine protease EspP and the enterohemolysin
      translocator EhxD were found to be directly involved in biofilm formation. In
      addition, EhxD and EspP were also important for adherence to T84 intestinal
      epithelial cells, suggesting a role for these genes in tissue interactions in
      vivo.

TI  - Mucosal flora in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis - an overview.
PG  - 61-71
AB  - The intestinal flora harbors varies pathogens. Clostridium perfringens (gas
      gangrene), Enterococci (endocarditis), Enterobacteriaceae (sepsis), Bacteroides
      (abscesses) are present in the large intestine of every healthy person in high
      concentrations. These bacteria are, however, separated from the colonic wall by
      an impenetrable mucus layer and are tolerated by the host. This separation is
      disturbed in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), where bacteria
      adhere to the mucosa and invade epithelial cells with concomitant inflammatory
      response. This chronic bowel inflammation can not subside as long as the mucus
      barrier remains defective. The inflammatory response interferes with the state of
      tolerance to the intestinal bacteria and leads to characteristic changes in the
      biostructure of the faecal microbiota. These changes in the biostructure of
      faecal microbiota are specific for active Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis 
      (UC) and can be longitudinally monitored. The reason for the defect of the mucus 
      barrier in IBD patients is unclear. Epidemiologic studies indicate a negative
      role of western lifestyle and foods and document the rise in the incidence of IBD
      in the industrialized countries during the 20(th) century. In parallel to this,
      detergents were introduced in households and emulsifiers were increasingly added 
      to food. The cleaning effect of these on the colonic mucus has to be
      investigated. The present contribution summarizes new data on the biostructure of
      the intestinal microbiota.

      disease.
PG  - 1696-707
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21251 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are considered important
      pharmaconutrients for modulating mucosal immunity and therapeutic responses in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We investigated the influence of 
      diet therapy involving the use of an "n-3 PUFA food exchange table" (n-3DP) on
      the fatty acid composition of the erythrocyte membranes of IBD patients and its
      remission-maintaining effects. METHODS: We analyzed the fatty acid composition of
      the erythrocyte membrane before and after n-3DP intervention in 20 initial-onset 
      IBD patients who had not undergone any dietary intervention. We then analyzed it 
      again and evaluated disease activity after 12-18 months intervention in 230 IBD
      patients (168 ulcerative colitis, 62 Crohn's disease; follow-up group) in whom
      n-3DP was introduced after remission had been achieved. The follow-up group was
      divided into remission and relapse groups. RESULTS: In the 20 initial-onset
      patients, the mean n-3/n-6 ratio significantly increased after intervention (0.41
      +/- 0.16 versus 0.70 +/- 0.20; P < 0.001). In the follow-up group the ratio in
      the remission group (n = 145) was significantly higher than that in the relapse
      group (n = 85) (0.65 +/- 0.28 versus 0.53 +/- 0.18; P < 0.001). The ratio
      significantly decreased in those who suffered a relapse after the beginning of
      treatment (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: N-3DP significantly increased the erythrocyte 
      membrane n-3/n-6 ratio in IBD patients, and this ratio was significantly higher
      in the remission group, suggesting that n-3DP alters the fatty acid composition
      of the cell membrane and influences clinical activity in IBD patients.

TI  - Dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and the aetiology of ulcerative colitis: 
      a UK prospective cohort study.
PG  - 602-6
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0b013e3283352d05 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aetiology of ulcerative colitis (UC) is largely unknown, although
      it is plausible that dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may be
      protective. Metabolites derived from n-3 PUFAs are less proinflammatory than
      those from n-6 PUFAs. Earlier, no prospective cohort studies have investigated
      this hypothesis, using dietary information collected from food diaries. The aim
      of this study was to investigate the total dietary intake of n-3 PUFAs and the
      specific n-3 PUFAs, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on
      the risk of developing incident UC. METHODOLOGY: Twenty-five thousand six hundred
      and thirty-nine participants, living in Norfolk UK, aged 45-74 years (median age 
      at recruitment of 59.2 years), completed 7-day food diaries. These were
      interpreted using a computer programme, which converted food items into
      nutrients, including n-3 PUFAs. The cohort was monitored for participants who
      developed UC. Each case was matched with four controls and an analysis performed 
      using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: In the cohort, 22 incident cases 
      of UC were identified after a median follow-up time of 4.2 years (range 1.8-8.3
      years). A statistically significant protective odds ratio (OR) for the trend
      across tertiles was found for DHA [OR = 0.43, 95% confidence interval
      (CI)=0.22-0.86, P = 0.02] and borderline statistically significant differences
      for trends for total total n-3 PUFAs (OR = 0.56, 95% CI=0.28-1.13, P = 0.10) and 
      EPA (OR = 0.53, 95% CI=0.27-1.03, P = 0.06) after adjusting for age, sex, total
      energy intake, smoking, and other fatty acids. CONCLUSION: Total dietary n-3
      PUFAs, EPA, and DHA, particularly DHA were associated with protection from UC in 
      a cohort aged over 45 years. If the association is causal, then increasing the
      population's intake of n-3 PUFAs from oily fish may help prevent UC.

LID - 10.2146/ajhp090168 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The pharmacology, uses, dosages, safety, drug interactions, and
      contraindications of probiotics are reviewed. SUMMARY: Probiotics are live
      nonpathogenic microorganisms administered to improve microbial balance,
      particularly in the gastrointestinal tract. They consist of Saccharomyces
      boulardii yeast or lactic acid bacteria, such as Lactobacillus and
      Bifidobacterium species, and are regulated as dietary supplements and foods.
      Probiotics exert their beneficial effects through various mechanisms, including
      lowering intestinal pH, decreasing colonization and invasion by pathogenic
      organisms, and modifying the host immune response. Probiotic benefits associated 
      with one species or strain do not necessarily hold true for others. The strongest
      evidence for the clinical effectiveness of probiotics has been in the treatment
      of acute diarrhea, most commonly due to rotavirus, and pouchitis. More research
      is needed to clarify the role of probiotics for preventing antibiotic-associated 
      diarrhea, Clostridium difficile infection, travelers' diarrhea, irritable bowel
      syndrome, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and vulvovaginal candidiasis.
      There is no consensus about the minimum number of microorganisms that must be
      ingested to obtain a beneficial effect; however, a probiotic should typically
      contain several billion microorganisms to increase the chance that adequate gut
      colonization will occur. Probiotics are generally considered safe and well
      tolerated, with bloating and flatulence occurring most frequently. They should be
      used cautiously in patients who are critically ill or severely immunocompromised 
      or those with central venous catheters since systemic infections may rarely
      occur. Bacteria-derived probiotics should be separated from antibiotics by at
      least two hours. CONCLUSION: Probiotics have demonstrated efficacy in preventing 
      and treating various medical conditions, particularly those involving the
      gastrointestinal tract. Data supporting their role in other conditions are often 
      conflicting.

      cases of ischemic colitis (IC) and complications of constipation (CoC) associated
      with the use of alosetron. The objectives of this study were to characterize IC
      and CoC clinical features, outcomes, and incidence rates in the new restricted
      patient population to evaluate the effectiveness of the RMP in the prevention of 
      serious outcomes. METHODS: Safety data from adverse event reporting from November
      2002 through June 2008 were reviewed for probable and possible IC and CoC using
      the US Food and Drug Administration/sponsor-defined criteria and definitions.
      Evidence for IC included medical documentation, colonoscopy, and
      sigmoidoscopy+/-biopsy. Evidence for CoC included medical history and
      confirmation from health-care professionals. RESULTS: Within the inclusion dates,
      29,072 patients received 203,939 alosetron prescriptions. Although the absolute
      numbers of IC and CoC cases have declined, the incidence rates for IC and CoC
      (0.95 and 0.36 cases per 1,000 patient-years, respectively) were similar to rates
      during the postmarketing cycle before alosetron withdrawal. In patients with
      severe IBS-D receiving alosetron (n=998) or placebo (n=411) in clinical trials
      since reintroduction, incidence rates for IC were 4 and 2 cases per 1,000
      patients, respectively. Rates for CoC were 2 and 0 cases per 1,000 patients in
      the alosetron and placebo groups, respectively. No mesenteric ischemia,
      surgeries, transfusions, or deaths occurred in patients with IC and no cases of
      CoC were associated with toxic megacolon, perforation, surgeries, transfusions,
      or deaths. IC and CoC cases were typically of short duration and all improved on 
      prompt withdrawal of alosetron. CONCLUSIONS: Serious outcomes associated with IC 
      and CoC appear to be mitigated since introduction of alosetron under the RMP.

AB  - Probiotics as dietary supplements have been readily accepted by Asian
      populations. Use of certain probiotic preparations is widespread and the number
      of clinical trials undertaken with such products is unparalleled in western
      scientific literature. One such preparation, containing a combination of
      Enterococcus faecium R0026 and Bacillus subtilis R0179, has 23 publications on
      post-market clinical studies involving over 1,800 adults. The majority of these
      publications are printed in Chinese and Korean journals. This review examines the
      clinical findings with this probiotic combination. As mono-therapy, it has been
      used to overcome symptoms associated with chronic diarrhoea and irritable bowel
      syndrome. It has been used as co-adjuvant therapy with sulfasalazine and
      mesalazine to improve remission times in mild to moderate Ulcerative Colitis and 
      to improve compliance with conventional triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori
      eradication. While the much of the data is preliminary and the study designs
      require refinement, the contribution of these trials should not be ignored. The
      information derived in this review will provide practitioners with practical
      information on appropriate applications for probiotic supplements, expected
      outcomes, dosing regimes, safety and reported adverse events. Furthermore,
      identification of problems in these trials should help researchers design better 
      clinical trials when investigating probiotic products.

TI  - Extraintestinal manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease: epidemiology,
      diagnosis, and management.
PG  - 97-114
LID - 10.3109/07853890903559724 [doi]
AB  - Abstract Extraintestinal manifestations occur rather frequently in inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD), e.g. ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The
      present paper provides an overview of the epidemiology, clinical characteristics,
      diagnostic process, and management of rheumatic, metabolic, dermatologic
      (mucocutaneous), ophthalmologic, hepatobiliary, hematologic, thromboembolic,
      urinary tract, pulmonary, and pancreatic extraintestinal manifestations related
      to IBD. Articles were identified through search of the PubMed and Embase
      databases, the Cochrane Library, and the web sites of the European Agency for the
      Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) and the US Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) (cut-off date October 2009). The search terms 'Crohn's disease',
      'inflammatory bowel disease', or 'ulcerative colitis' were combined with the
      terms 'adalimumab', 'anemia', 'arthritis', 'bronchiectasis', 'bronchitis',
      'cutaneous manifestations', 'erythema nodosum', 'extraintestinal manifestations',
      'hyperhomocysteinemia', 'infliximab', 'iridocyclitis', 'lung disease', 'ocular
      manifestations', 'osteomalacia', 'pancreatitis', 'primary sclerosing
      cholangitis', 'renal stones', 'sulfasalazine', 'thromboembolism', and
      'treatment'. The search was performed on English-language reviews, practical
      guidelines, letters, and editorials. Articles were selected based on their
      relevance, and additional papers were retrieved from their reference lists. Since
      some of the diseases discussed are uncommon, valid evidence of treatment was
      difficult to obtain, and epidemiologic data on the rarer forms of extraintestinal
      manifestations are scarce. However, updates on the pathophysiology and treatment 
      regimens are given for each of these disorders. This paper offers a current
      review of original research papers and randomized clinical trials, if any, within
      the field and makes an attempt to point out practical guidelines for the
      diagnosis and treatment of various extraintestinal manifestations related to IBD.

TI  - [Usefulness of probiotics in prevention and therapy].
PG  - 345-9
LID - 10.1055/s-0030-1249168 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics exert distinct effects on the intestinal mucosa and the immune system 
      that can be used in preventive and therapeutic settings. There is evidence to
      support the use of probiotics in necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants and
      pouchitis. Furthermore, the immunomodulatory effects of probiotics seem to
      ameliorate atopic diseases, in particular atopic dermatitis. The efficacy of
      probiotics has been shown comparable to Mesalazine regarding the maintenance of
      remission in ulcerative colitis. In addition there is evidence that probiotics
      are useful in the prevention of pouchitis or in therapy of irritable bowel
      syndrome. Recent data indicate that commensals and probiotics could play a role
      in nutrient fermentation and energy metabolism and may be helpful in the
      prevention and therapy of obesity.

TI  - Immunosuppressive effects via human intestinal dendritic cells of probiotic
      bacteria and steroids in the treatment of acute ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1286-98
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21222 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In ulcerative colitis (UC) gut bacteria drive inflammation. Bacterial
      recognition and T-cell responses are shaped by intestinal dendritic cells (DCs); 
      therapeutic effects of probiotic bacteria may relate to modulation of intestinal 
      DC. The probiotic mixture, VSL#3, increases interleukin (IL)-10 and downregulates
      IL-12p40 production by DC in vitro. We evaluated in vivo effects of oral VSL#3
      and steroids on colonic DC in patients with acute UC. METHODS: Rectal biopsies
      were obtained from patients with active UC before and after treatment with VSL#3,
      corticosteroids, or placebo, and from healthy controls. Myeloid colonic DC were
      studied from freshly isolated lamina propria cells using multicolor flow
      cytometry. Surface expression of activation markers, CD40, CD86, pattern
      recognition receptors, Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 and TLR-4 were assessed.
      Changed function was measured from ongoing intracellular IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-6,
      and IL-13 production. RESULTS: Acute UC colonic myeloid DC were producing more
      IL-10 and IL-12p40 than control DC (P = 0.01). In VSL#3-treated patients DC TLR-2
      expression decreased (P < 0.05), IL-10 production increased and IL-12p40
      production decreased (P < 0.005); 10/14 patients on VSL#3 showed a clinical
      response. Corticosteroids also resulted in increased IL-10 and reduced IL-12p40
      production by DC. Conversely, in patients on placebo, TLR-2 expression and
      intensity of staining for IL-12p40 and IL-6 increased (all P < 0.05); 5/14
      patients on placebo showed a clinical response (P = NS). CONCLUSIONS: Despite
      small numbers of human colonic DC available, we showed that treatment of UC
      patients with probiotic VSL#3 and corticosteroids induced "favorable" intestinal 
      DC function in vivo, increasing regulatory cytokines and lowering proinflammatory
      cytokines and TLR expression. These effects may contribute to therapeutic
      benefit.

TI  - Probiotics for maintaining remission of ulcerative colitis in adults.
PG  - 565-71
LID - 10.1345/aph.1M498 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate evidence for probiotic efficacy for maintaining remission 
      of ulcerative colitis (UC) in adults. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search
      (1948-November 2009) was conducted using ulcerative colitis and probiotics as
      terms for identifying pertinent studies. Search limits included English language 
      and humans. Additional information was obtained from bibliographies. STUDY
      SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Prospective trials published in English and
      conducted in adults were included. Two open-label and 3 double-blind randomized
      trials evaluated probiotic efficacy for maintaining remission of UC. Clinical and
      surrogate markers for maintaining remission of UC were assessed. DATA SYNTHESIS: 
      A relationship between immune response and gastrointestinal microbials appears to
      be involved in the mechanism of UC. Trial results comparing the probiotic
      Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 to mesalazine have reported equivalent rates of UC
      relapse. Treatment with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG strain alone or in combination
      with mesalazine resulted in a nonsignificant odds ratio decrease for relapse and 
      a significant increase in time to relapse compared to treatment with mesalazine
      alone. Additionally, bifidobacteria-fermented milk-supplemented patients had
      significant reductions in UC exacerbations when compared to nonsupplemented
      patients. Probiotics were well tolerated, with adverse event rates similar
      between treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Studies evaluating probiotics for maintaining
      remission of UC are limited by trial design and use of different probiotics with 
      variable bacterial contents. Thus, questions remain regarding optimal probiotic, 
      dosing, specific patient populations, and placement in therapy. To answer these
      questions, large, randomized, controlled trials need to be conducted before
      probiotics can be routinely recommended for maintaining remission of UC.

PG  - S228-34

AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases are the result of an abnormal immune response to
      environmental factors including the intestinal microbiota. Epithelial and immune 
      cells of the intestinal mucosa recognise specific bacterial molecules via Toll
      like and NOD like receptors and this interaction modulates the inflammatory
      response (activation of the NF-kappaB pathway). It is thus rational to try
      treatments which could modify the intestinal microbiota i.e. antibiotics, new
      substrates (prebiotics) or new micro-organisms (probiotics). We review the
      literature on existing evidence for the efficacy of probiotic strains or
      combinations in patients with pouchitis (good evidence), ulcerative colitis (fair
      evidence), and Crohn's disease (no evidence at the present time). We also discuss
      the mechanisms of action, the use of microbial agents as pharmacological vectors,
      the development of genetically modified probiotics (including a clinical pilot
      trial in patients with Crohn's disease), and safety issues.

TI  - Defensin-immunology in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - S137-44
LID - 10.1016/S0399-8320(09)73149-5 [doi]
AB  - Defensins are endogenous antibiotics with microbicidal activity against
      Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, fungi, enveloped viruses and protozoa. 
      A disturbed antimicrobial defense, as provided by Paneth- and other epithelial
      cell defensins, seems to be a critical factor in the pathogenesis of inflammatory
      bowel diseases. Conspicuously, there is a relative lack of Paneth cell
      beta-defensins HD-5 and HD-6 in ileal Crohn's disease, both in the absence of a
      pattern recognition receptor NOD2 mutation and, even more pronounced, in its
      presence. This deficit is independent of concurrent active inflammation and
      results in a diminished antibacterial killing by the mucosa. The Crohn's disease 
      mucosa has not only a significant lack in killing different Escherichia coli but 
      also an impaired ability in clearing Staphylococcus aureus as well as anaerobic
      micro-organisms. Thus, this dysfunction in antibacterial barrier seems to be
      broad and is not restricted to a single bacterial strain. In addition to directly
      controlling barrier function, Paneth cell defensins also regulate the composition
      of the bacterial stool flora. In the majority of patients, the Paneth cell
      deficiency is mediated by WNT signalling which suggests a disturbed Paneth cell
      differentiation in ileal Crohn's disease. In contrast, colonic Crohn's disease is
      characterised by an impaired induction of mucosal beta-defensins, partly due to a
      low copy number of the beta-defensin gene cluster. Therefore it seems plausible
      that bacteria take advantage of a niche formed by defensin deficiency. This would
      represent a paradigm shift in understanding Crohn's disease and provides a target
      for future therapeutic strategies.

TI  - Guidance for substantiating the evidence for beneficial effects of probiotics:
      probiotics in chronic inflammatory bowel disease and the functional disorder
      irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 690S-7S
LID - 10.3945/jn.109.113746 [doi]
AB  - Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, the 2 distinct idiopathic pathologies of 
      inflammatory bowel diseases, are spontaneously relapsing, immunologically
      mediated disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. Selected probiotics strains
      have been proven to be clinically effective in maintaining remission in patients 
      with ulcerative colitis. None of the probiotics thus far tested has been shown to
      be effective in induction of remission or in maintenance of remission in patients
      with Crohn's disease. The multispecies probiotics mixture of 8 strains seems
      effective in the maintenance of remission in pouchitis. Irritable bowel syndrome 
      is a functional bowel disorder manifested by chronic, recurring abdominal pain or
      discomfort associated with disturbed bowel habit in the absence of structural
      abnormalities likely to account for these symptoms. Recently conducted
      appropriately powered studies with different (combinations of) probiotics show
      positive results on reduction of symptoms, although a considerable placebo effect
      is also found. Mechanistic studies aimed at pathophysiological mechanisms of
      inflammatory bowel diseases can identify new targets for probiotic bacteria.

TI  - Pathogenesis of Escherichia coli O157:H7 strain 86-24 following oral infection of
      BALB/c mice with an intact commensal flora.
PG  - 131-42
LID - 10.1016/j.micpath.2010.01.003 [doi]
AB  - Escherichia coli O157:H7 is a food-borne pathogen that can cause hemorrhagic
      colitis and, occasionally, hemolytic uremic syndrome, a sequela of infection that
      can result in renal failure and death. Here we sought to model the pathogenesis
      of orally-administered E. coli O157:H7 in BALB/c mice with an intact intestinal
      flora. First, we defined the optimal dose that permitted sustained fecal shedding
      of E. coli O157:H7 over 7 days ( approximately 10(9) colony forming units). Next,
      we monitored the load of E. coli O157:H7 in intestinal sections over time and
      observed that the cecum was consistently the tissue with the highest E. coli
      O157:H7 recovery. We then followed the expression of two key E. coli O157:H7
      virulence factors, the adhesin intimin and Shiga toxin type 2, and detected both 
      proteins early in infection when bacterial burdens were highest. Additionally, we
      noted that during infection, animals lost weight and approximately 30% died.
      Moribund animals also exhibited elevated levels of blood urea nitrogen, and, on
      necropsy, showed evidence of renal tubular damage. We conclude that conventional 
      mice inoculated orally with high doses of E. coli O157:H7 can be used to model
      both intestinal colonization and subsequent development of certain
      extraintestinal manifestations of E. coli O157:H7 disease.

AB  - A 71-year-old man was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis (UC) complicated by

      steroid therapy or antibiotics. Although the patient's UC failed to respond to
      several types of induction therapy, his condition finally improved when treated
      using Bifidobacterium. Probiotics could be one of the treatment agents for
      induction of remission in UC.

TI  - Gatekeepers of intestinal inflammation.
PG  - 1-14
AB  - The intestine is subjected to a barrage of insults from food, bacterial flora,
      and pathogens. Despite this constant antigenic challenge, the mucosal tissues
      lining the intestinal tract remain largely under control. The mechanisms
      regulating the homeostatic balance in the gut have been investigated for many
      years by many groups, but the precise nature of the regulatory control remains
      elusive. In this review, we provide an overview of pathways proposed to be
      involved in dampening the inflammatory response and maintaining the homeostatic
      balance in the intestine, and how these pathways may be disrupted in ulcerative
      colitis and Crohn's disease.

TI  - Combining nutrition, food science and engineering in developing solutions to
      Inflammatory bowel diseases--omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids as an example.
PG  - 60-72
LID - 10.1039/c0fo00057d [doi]
AB  - The Inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are
      debilitating conditions, characterised by lifelong sensitivity to certain foods, 
      and often a need for surgery and life-long medication. The anti-inflammatory
      effects of long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated acids justify their inclusion in
      enteral nutrition formulas that have been associated with disease remission.
      However, there have been variable data in clinical trials to test supplementary
      omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in inducing or maintaining remission in these
      diseases. Although variability in trial design has been suggested as a major
      factor, we suggest that variability in processing and presentation of the
      products may be equally or more important. The nature of the source, and rapidity
      of getting the fish or other food source to processing or to market, will affect 
      the percentage of the various fatty acids, possible presence of heavy metal
      contaminants and oxidation status of the various fatty acids. For dietary
      supplements or fortified foods, whether the product is encapsulated or not,
      whether storage is under nitrogen or not, and length of time between harvest,
      processing and marketing will again profoundly affect the properties of the final
      product. Clinical trials to test efficacy of these products in IBD to date have
      utilised the relevant skills of pharmacology and gastroenterology. We suggest
      that knowledge from food science, nutrition and engineering will be essential to

AB  - Inflammation is part of the normal host response to infection and injury.
      However, inappropriate inflammation contributes to several diseases, including
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Both conditions
      are characterized by the excessive production of inflammatory cytokines,
      arachidonic acid (AA)-derived eicosanoids, and other inflammatory agents (e.g.,
      reactive oxygen species, adhesion molecules). By virtue of their
      anti-inflammatory action, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) may be
      beneficial in inflammatory diseases. A large body of evidence supports a
      protective effect of omega-3 PUFA in experimental animal and ex-vivo models of
      Crohn's disease (CD), Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
      Although fish oil supplementation in patients with IBD results in omega-3 PUFA
      incorporation into gut mucosal tissue and modification of inflammatory mediator
      profiles, the evidence of clinical benefits of omega-3 PUFA is weak. On the other
      hand, more convincing data support the efficacy of omega-3 PUFA in reducing pain,
      number of tender joints, duration of morning stiffness, use of non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs and improving physical performance in RA patients. In
      both IBD and RA further clinical trials with large sample size are needed to
      clarify the efficacy of omega-3 PUFA as a treatment.

AB  - The aim of the study was the evaluation of frequency and titre of IgA ASCA and
      IgG ASCA and p-ANCA, c-ANCA in children with IBD and occurrence of ASCA
      antibodies in relation to coexistence of FA. Patients and methods. The study
      comprised 95 children at the ages of 2 to 18 years. The diagnosis of IBD was
      established on the basis of Porto criteria. Tests of blood serum were performed
      in all children: IgA and IgG ASCA, p-ANCA, c-ANCA using ELISA method. Results.
      IgE-dependent FA was found in 32.5% children with UC and in 21% with CD. We did
      not observe any relation between the occurrence of FA and the frequency and ASCA 
      titre. p-ANCA were significantly more frequent in the group of children with UC. 
      The occurrence of ASCA antibodies was observed in 73.7% of children with CD,
      17.5% with UC and almost 30% with allergic colitis. Conclusions. Patients with CD
      and the presence of ASCA revealed a significantly more frequent localization of
      lesions within the small bowel and a tendency towards older age. We observed a
      connection between the occurrence of antibodies and the examined mutations of
      gene NOD2/CARD15.

AB  - Many milk-derived components have immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory
      properties, and some of these reduce intestinal inflammation when orally
      administered to animal models of colitis. However, the potential for ruminant
      milk or milk components to benefit people with intestinal inflammatory disorders 
      (such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease) has not been well-researched. This review
      describes published research into mechanisms by which ruminant milk and its
      components may have beneficial effects when consumed by people who have
      intestinal inflammation.

TI  - Starch-entrapped microspheres show a beneficial fermentation profile and decrease
      in potentially harmful bacteria during in vitro fermentation in faecal microbiota
      obtained from patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1514-24
LID - 10.1017/S0007114509993515 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this research was to test the hypothesis that starch-entrapped
      microspheres would produce favourable fermentation profiles and microbial shifts 
      during in vitro fermentation with the faecal microbiota from patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In vitro fermentation was carried out using a
      validated, dynamic, computer-controlled model of the human colon (Toegepast
      Natuurwetenschappelijk Onderzoek gastro-intestinal model-2) after inoculation
      with pooled faeces from healthy individuals, patients with inactive IBD (Crohn's 
      disease (CD)) or patients with active IBD (ulcerative colitis (UC)).
      Starch-entrapped microspheres fermented more slowly and produced more butyrate
      than fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) when fermented with the faecal microbiota from
      patients with active UC. When fermented with the microbiota from patients with
      inactive CD, starch-entrapped microspheres also fermented more slowly but
      produced similar amounts of butyrate compared with FOS. Starch-entrapped
      microspheres showed a greater ability to maintain a low pH during
      simulated-distal colon conditions compared with FOS. After fermentation with the 
      microbiota from inactive CD patients, starch-entrapped microspheres resulted in
      lower concentrations of some potentially harmful gut bacteria, included in
      Bacteroides, Enterococcus, Fusobacterium and Veillonella, compared with FOS.
      These findings suggest that slow fermenting starch-entrapped microspheres may
      induce a favourable colonic environment in patients with IBD through high
      butyrate production, maintenance of low pH in the distal colon and inhibition of 
      the growth of potentially harmful bacteria.

TI  - Impact of oral bisphenol A at reference doses on intestinal barrier function and 
      sex differences after perinatal exposure in rats.
PG  - 448-53
LID - 10.1073/pnas.0907697107 [doi]
AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA), a chemical estrogen widely used in the food-packaging industry
      and baby bottles, is recovered in human fluids (0.1-10 nM). Recent studies have
      reported that BPA is hormonally active at low doses, emphasizing the debate of a 
      risk for human health. Estrogen receptors are expressed in the colon, and
      although the major route of BPA exposure is food, the effects on gut have
      received no attention. We first examined the endocrine disrupting potency of BPA 
      on colonic paracellular permeability (CPP), experimental colitis, and visceral
      sensitivity in ovariectomized rats orally exposed to 5 mg/kg/d BPA (i.e., the no 
      observed adverse effect level), 50 microg/kg/d BPA (i.e., tolerable daily
      intake), or lower doses. BPA dose-dependently decreased basal CPP, with a
      half-maximal inhibitory dose of 5.2 microg/kg/d, 10-fold below the tolerable
      daily intake. This correlated with an increase in epithelial tight junction
      sealing, also observed in Caco-2 cells exposed to 10 nM BPA. When ovariectomized 
      rats were fed with BPA at the no observed adverse effect level, the severity of
      colitis was reduced, whereas the same dose increased pain sensitivity to
      colorectal stimuli. We then examined the impact of perinatal exposure to BPA on
      intestinal permeability and inflammatory response in the offspring. In female
      rats, but not in male rats, perinatal BPA evoked a decrease of CPP in adulthood, 
      whereas the proinflammatory response of colonic mucosa was strengthened. This
      study first demonstrates that the xenoestrogen BPA at reference doses influences 
      intestinal barrier function and gut nociception. Moreover, perinatal exposure
      promotes the development of severe inflammation in adult female offspring only.

AB  - Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) cause diarrhoea, haemorrhagic colitis 
      and the haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS). EHEC cause sporadic, epidemic, and
      occasionally fatal infections in Germany and worldwide. The most probable natural
      reservoirs of EHEC are domestic cattle (in which these organisms cause no
      disease), but wild animals also excrete EHEC asymptomatically. Humans (chiefly
      children) acquire EHEC from contact with animals (e. g. in petting zoos) or
      indirectly, by consuming food or water contaminated with these pathogens. Acid
      resistant EHEC survive the acidic human stomach, colonize the intestines, and
      produce Shiga toxins. Current models suggest that Shiga toxins preferentially
      bind to microvascular endothelial cells of the renal glomeruli and the brain and 
      inhibit protein synthesis, or possibly injure eukaryotic cells via other
      mechanisms. Resulting microangiopathy, therefore, forms the pathological basis of
      HUS. Additionally, non-Shiga toxin effectors produced by EHEC, including the
      LEE-encoded proteins, EHEC-haemolysin, cytolethal distending toxin (CDT), the
      serine protease EspP, subtilase cytotoxin, and iron-acquisition molecules are
      also postulated to play roles in virulence. Our evolving understanding of EHEC
      pathogenesis now compels us to test the hypothesis that HUS is a multifactorial
      consequence of EHEC infection, that involves not only Shiga toxins, but a
      repertoire of EHEC virulence factors that synergistically cause profound vascular
      and organ injury.

TI  - Anti-TNF antibody therapy for inflammatory bowel disease during pregnancy: a
      clinical review.
PG  - 234-41
AB  - The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; Crohn's disease, ulcerative
      colitis) is highest during the peak reproductive years, hence the increased
      concern with the safety of IBD drugs during pregnancy. Over the past 11 years,
      anti-TNF-alpha antibody therapy has emerged as a treatment approach for
      refractory IBD patients who have failed to achieve or maintain remission with
      corticosteroids and immunomodulator agents. The TNF-alpha inhibitors (anti-TNFs; 
      infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol) have proven successful in inducing
      and maintaining remission of moderate-to-severe IBD, but recommendations for the 
      use of these compounds during pregnancy have lacked consensus. Balanced against
      the potential risk of these drugs on the fetus is the well-established fact that 
      high disease activity has been found to poorly affect pregnancy outcomes in IBD, 
      and the potential use of anti-TNF agents may control disease flare and severity
      during pregnancy. Concerns regarding the effect of anti-TNFs on the pregnancy and
      fetus have been assuaged by registry data which has demonstrated an overall
      positive safety record. Both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the
      European Crohn's and Colitis Organization categorize anti-TNF agents as safe
      during pregnancy. New knowledge regarding the physiologic timing of placental
      transfer of therapeutic antibody subclasses and pegylated antibody fragments from
      the mother into the fetus has also helped to allay concerns. This review will
      examine the present state of knowledge regarding the use of anti-TNFs in pregnant
      women with IBD.

TI  - Therapeutic options to modulate barrier defects in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 450-4
LID - 10.1159/000233283 [doi]
AB  - In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), epithelial barrier function is impaired
      contributing to diarrhea by a leak flux mechanism and perpetuating inflammation
      by an increased luminal antigen uptake. This barrier of the intestinal epithelium
      is composed of the apical enterocyte membrane and the epithelial tight junction
      (TJ) and can be affected by TJ alterations, induction of epithelial apoptosis and
      appearance of gross lesions like erosions or ulcers as well as by accelerated
      transcytotic antigen uptake. TJ strands are reduced in Crohn's disease (CD) and
      strand breaks appear. Several of the 24 claudins are concerned in CD as e.g.
      claudin-2, -5 and -8. The epithelial apoptotic rate has also been shown to be
      elevated causing focal lesions. As far as regulation is concerned, Th1 cytokines 
      like TNF-alpha and interferon-gamma are important for CD, while Th2 responses are
      dominated by interleukin (IL)-13 and TNF-alpha in ulcerative colitis (UC). IL-13 
      does stimulate epithelial apoptosis as well as upregulates claudin-2 in UC.
      Together with an IL-13-dependent restitution arrest, this may explain why ulcer
      lesions are seen already early in UC but only in advanced stages of CD. Luminal
      antigen uptake occurs via TJ discontinuities, epithelial gross lesions and
      endocytotically. Therapeutically, anti-inflammatory remedies as e.g. TNF-alpha
      antibodies are most effective in improving active IBD and in parallel repairing
      barrier function. Again, this is assumed to be due to reduced cytokine release in
      active IBD, as a result of immune cell apoptosis. However, other agents can also 
      directly affect barrier function. Glutamine is discussed as a candidate for
      barrier therapy but has never been shown to have a direct barrier influence in
      CD, although it is an important metabolic fuel for enterocytes and has been shown
      to preserve barrier functions in laboratory models. Also, probiotics and TGF-beta
      and have beneficial effects in models, but no data exist on barrier repair in
      IBD. In contrast, zinc has been shown to improve barrier function in CD, although
      the inherent mechanisms are unknown. Finally, food components can strengthen the 
      epithelial barrier as for example the flavonoid quercetin which has been shown to
      upregulate claudin-4 within the epithelial TJ.

TI  - Safety of immunomodulators and biologics for the treatment of inflammatory bowel 
      disease during pregnancy and breast-feeding.
PG  - 881-95
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21154 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this article is to critically review available data regarding the
      safety of immunomodulators and biological therapies during pregnancy and
      breast-feeding in women with inflammatory bowel disease. Methotrexate and
      thalidomide can cause congenital anomalies and are contraindicated during
      pregnancy (and breast-feeding). Although thiopurines have a Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) rating D, available data suggest that these drugs are safe
      and well tolerated during pregnancy. Although traditionally women receiving
      azathioprine or mercaptopurine have been discouraged from breast-feeding because 
      of theoretical potential risks, it seems that these drugs may be safe in this
      scenario. Treatment with cyclosporine for steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis
      (UC) during pregnancy can be considered safe and effective, and the use of this
      drug should be considered in cases of severe UC as a means of avoiding urgent
      surgery. Breast-feeding is contraindicated for patients receiving cyclosporine.
      Biological therapies appear to be safe in pregnancy, as no increased risk of
      malformations has been demonstrated. Therefore, the limited clinical results
      available suggest that the benefits of infliximab and adalimumab in attaining
      response and maintaining remission in pregnant patients might outweigh the
      theoretical risks of drug exposure to the fetus. Stopping therapy in the third
      trimester may be considered, as it seems that transplacental transfer of
      infliximab is low prior to this. Certolizumab differs from infliximab and
      adalimumab in that it is a Fab fragment of an antitumor necrosis factor alpha
      monoclonal antibody, and therefore it may not be necessary to stop certolizumab
      in the third trimester. The use of infliximab is probably compatible with
      breast-feeding.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the benefits of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) in an
      extensively hydrolyzed casein formula (EHCF) in improving hematochezia and fecal 
      calprotectin over EHCF alone. STUDY DESIGN: Fecal calprotectin was compared in 30
      infants with hematochezia and 4 weeks after milk elimination with that of a
      healthy group. We also compared fecal calprotectin and hematochezia on 26
      formula-fed infants randomly assigned to EHCF with LGG (Nutramigen LGG) (EHCF +
      LGG) or without (Nutramigen) (EHCF - LGG) and on 4 breastfed infants whose
      mothers eliminated dairy. RESULTS: Fecal calprotectin in those with hematochezia 
      was significantly higher than in comparisons (mean +/- SD 325.89 +/- 152.31 vs
      131.97 +/- 37.98 microg/g stool, t = 6.79, P < .0001). At 4 weeks, fecal
      calprotectin decreased to 50% of baseline but was still significantly higher than
      in comparisons (157.5 +/- 149.13 vs 93.72 +/- 36.65 microg/g, P = .03). Fecal
      calprotectin mean decrease was significantly larger among EHCF + LGG compared
      with EHCF - LGG (-214.5 +/- 107.93 vs -112.7 +/- 105.27 microg/g, t = 2.43, P =
      .02). At 4 weeks, none of the EHCF + LGG had blood in stools, and 5/14 on EHCF - 
      LGG did (P = .002). CONCLUSION: Fecal calprotectin is elevated in infants with
      hematochezia and possible allergic colitis. EHCF + LGG resulted in significant
      improvement of hematochezia and fecal calprotectin compared with the EHCF alone.

TI  - A role for Campylobacter jejuni-induced enteritis in inflammatory bowel disease?
PG  - G1-9
LID - 10.1152/ajpgi.00193.2009 [doi]
AB  - The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis,
      are T cell-mediated diseases that are characterized by chronic, relapsing
      inflammation of the intestinal tract. The pathogenesis of IBD involves the
      complex interaction between the intestinal microflora, host genetic and immune
      factors, and environmental stimuli. Epidemiological analyses have implicated
      acute bacterial enteritis as one of the factors that may incite or exacerbate IBD
      in susceptible individuals. In this review, we examine how interactions between
      the common enteric pathogen Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni), the host intestinal
      epithelium, and resident intestinal microflora may contribute to the pathogenesis
      of IBD. Recent experimental evidence indicates that C. jejuni may permit the
      translocation of normal, noninvasive microflora via novel processes that
      implicate epithelial lipid rafts. This breach in intestinal barrier function may,
      in turn, prime the intestine for chronic inflammatory responses in susceptible
      individuals. Insights into the interactions between enteric pathogens, the host
      epithelia, and intestinal microflora will improve our understanding of disease
      processes that may initiate and/or exacerbate intestinal inflammation in patients
      with IBD and provide impetus for the development of new therapeutic approaches
      for the treatment of IBD.

AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are the two major forms of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and both diseases lead to high morbidity and
      health care costs. Complex interactions between the immune system, enteric
      commensal bacteria and host genotype are thought to underlie the development of
      IBD although the precise aetiology of this group of diseases is still unknown.
      The understanding of the composition and complexity of the normal gut microbiota 
      has been greatly aided by the use of molecular methods and is likely to be
      further increased with the advent of metagenomics and metatranscriptomics
      approaches, which will allow an increasingly more holistic assessment of the
      microbiome with respect to both diversity and function of the commensal gut
      microbiota. Studies thus far have shown that the intestinal microbiota drives the
      development of the gut immune system and can induce immune homeostasis as well as
      contribute to the development of IBD. Probiotics which deliver some of the
      beneficial immunomodulatory effects of the commensal gut microbiota and induce
      immune homeostasis have been proposed as a suitable treatment for mild to
      moderate IBD. This review provides an overview over the current understanding of 
      the commensal gut microbiota, its interactions with the mucosal immune system and
      its capacity to induce both gut homeostasis as well as dysregulation of the
      immune system. Bacterial-host events, including interactions with pattern
      recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed on epithelial cells and dendritic cells
      (DCs) and the resultant impact on immune responses at mucosal surfaces will be
      discussed.

TI  - Environmental factors affecting inflammatory bowel disease: have we made
      progress?
PG  - 215-25
LID - 10.1159/000228553 [doi]
AB  - The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is only partially
      understood; various environmental and host (e.g. genetic, epithelial, immune, and
      nonimmune) factors are involved. The critical role for environmental factors is
      strongly supported by recent worldwide trends in IBD epidemiology. One important 
      environmental factor is smoking. A meta-analysis partially confirms previous
      findings that smoking was found to be protective against ulcerative colitis and, 
      after the onset of the disease, might improve its course, decreasing the need for
      colectomy. In contrast, smoking increases the risk of developing Crohn's disease 
      and aggravates its course. The history of IBD is dotted by cyclic reports on the 
      isolation of specific infectious agents responsible for Crohn's disease or
      ulcerative colitis. The more recently published cold chain hypothesis is
      providing an even broader platform by linking dietary factors and microbial
      agents. An additional, recent theory has suggested a breakdown in the balance
      between putative species of 'protective' versus 'harmful' intestinal bacteria -
      this concept has been termed dysbiosis resulting in decreased bacterial
      diversity. Other factors such as oral contraceptive use, appendectomy, dietary
      factors (e.g. refined sugar, fat, and fast food), perinatal events, and childhood
      infections have also been associated with both diseases, but their role is more
      controversial. Nonetheless, there is no doubt that economic development, leading 
      to improved hygiene and other changes in lifestyle ('westernized lifestyle') may 
      play a role in the increase in IBD. This review article focuses on the role of
      environmental factors in the pathogenesis and progression of IBDs.

TI  - Do probiotics have a role in the management of inflammatory bowel disease?
PG  - 155-9
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease treatments have generally revolved around
      immunological manipulations to reduce inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract.
      Bacterial interactions with the gastrointestinal epithelium may be a trigger for 
      inflammatory changes which occur in the gut. Antibiotics have been shown to alter
      disease activity in Crohn's disease. Probiotics (live microorganisms)
      administered for therapeutic purposes have been proposed due to the possibility
      of their altering the interaction of the gut mucosa with enteric bacteria.
      Extensive randomized trials are lacking in this area at this time. Current trials
      indicate the possibility of maintaining remission in pouchitis (non-specific
      inflammation) and the potential for inducing and maintaining remission in
      ulcerative colitis. Trials in Crohn's disease have shown mixed results.

TI  - Evolving concepts in Clostridium difficile colitis.
PG  - 400-5
AB  - Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the most important cause of nosocomial
      diarrhea. The emergence of a hypervirulent strain and other factors including
      antibiotic overuse contribute to the increasing incidence and severity of this
      potentially lethal infection. CDI has been reported in persons previously
      considered as low risk, such as young healthy persons without exposure to health 
      care settings or antibiotics, peripartum women, and children. In patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease, the risk of C. difficile infection is even greater,
      with higher rates of hospitalization, bowel surgery, and mortality. With
      increasing incidence and severity of disease, the need for improved diagnostic,
      treatment, and infection control strategies cannot be overstated.

TI  - Diabetic diarrhea.
PG  - 354-9
AB  - Diabetic patients with diarrhea may present clinical challenges in diagnosis and 
      treatment. Particular diagnoses are more prevalent in diabetic patients than in
      the general population. Medications are often a culprit for chronic diarrhea, and
      the medication list should always be carefully scrutinized for those with
      diarrhea as a side effect. In diabetic patients, metformin is a common cause of
      diarrhea. Diabetic patients are more likely to have associated diseases (eg,
      celiac sprue and microscopic colitis) that present with diarrhea as the sole
      complaint. Ingested sugar-free foods that may contain sorbitol or other agents
      can cause diarrhea in diabetic patients. Finally, diabetic enteropathy can itself
      cause diarrhea. The various etiologies can be diagnosed with a thorough history
      and appropriate diagnostic tests. This article focuses on the etiologies of
      diarrhea that are seen with higher incidence in diabetic patients.

      inflammation in animal models -- a review.
PG  - 1281-8
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.200800576 [doi]
AB  - This review provides an overview over studies in experimental animals aimed at
      elucidating the influence of dietary constituents on colo-rectal inflammation.
      Human studies as well as in vitro investigations will not be covered. In
      experimental animals, a variety of chemical treatments and genetic modifications,
      lead to various types of gut inflammation. In a number of these models, there is 
      good evidence for an anti-inflammatory action of dietary tocopherols, certain
      polyphenols, and curcumin at relatively high oral doses. It has also been
      established, that oral application of fats and oils rich in n-3 PUFAs and/or
      conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) can attenuate certain types of colitis in
      experimental animal models. While the effect of dietary calcium on experimental
      colitis is less clear, there are hints indicating that certain high-fiber diets
      or diets rich in digestion-resistant carbohydrates ("fiber") can attenuate
      experimental colitis in animals, although contradictory results have been
      reported. In summary, the anti-inflammatory potency of dietary constituents on
      colon inflammation in experimental animals seems to be rather limited. The
      reasons for this lack of activity seem to be manifold including pharmacokinetic
      limitations and intestinal degradation of the compounds, in particular
      insufficient local, i. e., intra- or sub-mucosal levels of the effective
      compounds, and general limitations of animal models.

TI  - Probiotic-induced changes in the intestinal epithelium: implications in
      gastrointestinal disease.
PG  - 76-85
AB  - There is resurgent interest in the use of probiotics to maintain gastrointestinal
      and systemic health, driven by recent advances in knowledge of bacterial
      interactions with the epithelium and innate immune system of the intestine. The
      effects of probiotic bacteria on the intestinal epithelium and their downstream
      consequences are reviewed. Probiotics prevent pathogen adherence and invasion of 
      the epithelium, partly by blocking adherence sites but also by upregulating gene 
      expression of MUC2 and of antimicrobial peptides. Metabolic effects of probiotics
      on the intestinal epithelium include production of short chain fatty acids which 
      influence epithelial cell metabolism, turnover and apoptosis. Bacterial
      metabolism of unabsorbed dietary constituents with production of free radicals
      and phenolic metabolites can lead to DNA damage and cancer; probiotics restore
      eubiosis and potentially prevent this. Probiotics alter expression and
      redistribution of tight junction proteins and reduce intestinal permeability
      limiting absorption of noxious molecules from the gut lumen. Most studied are the
      effects of probiotics on epithelial cells which are the first line of innate
      immune-capable cells that encounter luminal flora. Probiotics, through secreted
      molecules, influence the innate inflammatory response of epithelial cells to
      stimuli from the gut lumen, and reduce mucosal inflammation. Through effects on
      dendritic, and possibly epithelial, cells they influence naive T cells in the
      lamina propria of the gut and thus influence adaptive immunity. These varied
      effects of probiotics have implications for the treatment of several
      gastrointestinal diseases including antibiotic-associated colitis, acute
      gastroenteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, colon cancer, and irritable bowel
      syndrome.

TI  - Comparison of the immunomodulatory properties of three probiotic strains of
      Lactobacilli using complex culture systems: prediction for in vivo efficacy.
PG  - e7056
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0007056 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: While the use of probiotics to treat or prevent inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) has been proposed, to this point the clinical benefits have been
      limited. In this report we analyzed the immunological activity of three strains
      of Lactobacillus to predict their in vivo efficacy in protecting against
      experimental colitis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We compared the
      immunological properties of Lactobacillus plantarum NCIMB8826, L. rhamnosus GG
      (LGG), L. paracasei B21060 and pathogenic Salmonella typhimurium (SL1344). We
      studied the stimulatory effects of these different strains upon dendritic cells
      (DCs) either directly by co-culture or indirectly via conditioning of an
      epithelial intermediary. Furthermore, we characterized the effects of these
      strains in vivo using a Dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) model of colitis. We found 
      that the three strains exhibited different abilities to induce inflammatory
      cytokine production by DCs with L. plantarum being the most effective followed by
      LGG and L. paracasei. L. paracasei minimally induced the release of cytokines,
      while it also inhibited the potential of DCs to both produce inflammatory
      cytokines (IL-12 and TNF-alpha) and to drive Th1 T cells in response to
      Salmonella. This effect on DCs was found under both direct and indirect
      stimulatory conditions - i.e. mediated by epithelial cells - and was dependent
      upon an as yet unidentified soluble mediator. When tested in vivo, L. plantarum
      and LGG exacerbated the development of DSS-induced colitis and caused the death
      of treated mice, while, conversely L. paracasei was protective. CONCLUSIONS: We
      describe a new property of probiotics to either directly or indirectly inhibit DC
      activation by inflammatory bacteria. Moreover, some immunostimulatory probiotics 
      not only failed to protect against colitis, they actually amplified the disease
      progression. In conclusion, caution must be exercised when choosing a probiotic
      strain to treat IBD.

AB  - Probiotics have been used to treat human gastrointestinal inflammations including
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the exact mechanisms by which
      probiotics act to protect against intestinal inflammation have yet to be fully
      elucidated. The aim of this study was to evaluate anti-inflammatory effects of
      Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris FC using in vivo and in vitro inflammation
      models. Colitis was induced in C57BL/6 mice by administration of 3% dextran
      sulfate sodium to drinking water. In the cellular level assessment, a gut
      inflammation model with the co-culture system consisting Caco-2 cells and
      RAW264.7 cells stimulated by LPS was used. Administration of L. lactis subsp.
      cremoris FC significantly ameliorated shortening of colon length and histological
      score of the colon in DSS-induce colitis mice. In addition, the treatment of L.
      lactis subsp. cremoris FC improved the aberrant mRNA expression in inflamed
      tissue near to control level through notable suppression of TNF-alpha (P<0.05),
      IFN-gamma (P<0.05), IL-6, iNOS, and MIP-2 mRNA expression. In addition, in a gut 
      inflammation model, treatment with L. lactis subsp. cremoris FC resulted in
      significant down-regulation of IL-8 mRNA expression in Caco-2 cells and
      inhibition of NF-kappaB nuclear translocation in RAW264.7 cells. Our findings
      indicate that administration of L. lactis subsp. cremoris FC improves negative
      effects of DSS-induced colitis in mice through the inhibition of inflammatory
      cell infiltration.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The pharmacokinetics and safety of Asacol (Tillotts Pharma AG,
      Ziefen, Switzerland), which has been used worldwide to treat ulcerative colitis
      and Crohn's disease, were studied in Japanese healthy male volunteers. METHODS:
      Drug plasma concentrations and urinary and fecal excretions after a single dose
      (400-4800 mg) and multiple doses (3600 mg/day for 7 days) were investigated.
      RESULTS: All adverse events were "not serious." The peak plasma concentration (C 
      max) was reached at 12.3-18.0 hours after a single dose, and the C max and area
      under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of mesalazine and its N-acetyl
      metabolite were proportional to the doses. The C max and AUC in non-Japanese
      subjects reported in the literature were closely correlated to findings in
      Japanese subjects, and external excretions were also similar in the Japanese and 
      non-Japanese subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Asacol was safe and well tolerated in this
      Japanese population, and the non-Japanese clinical data could be extrapolated to 
      the Japanese population.

AB  - Toll like receptors (TLR) regulate innate immune responses sensing byproducts of 
      intestinal microbiota. We examined responses to TLR agonists in children with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
      obtained from children with IBD [Crohn's disease (CD, n = 10), ulcerative colitis
      (UC, n = 10)], children with non-IgE-mediated food allergy (NFA, n = 20), and
      controls (n = 15) were tested for their production of proinflammatory and
      counter-regulatory cytokines with TLR agonists in comparison with their cytokine 
      production against milk protein and candida. IBD patients were all in the
      inactive state. IBD PBMC produced more IL-6 with all the TLR agonists tested than
      controls. CD PBMC produced more counter-regulatory cytokines with TLR agonists,
      while UC PBMC produced more IL-1ss and IL-10 with TLR 7/8 agonist than controls. 
      Cytokine production by NFA PBMC did not differ from controls. CD but not UC PBMC 
      produced more IFN-gamma and IL-17 with candida. Aberrant responses to TLR
      agonists may be associated with increase in IFN-gamma/IL-17 production against
      candida in CD children.

PG  - 653-60
LID - 10.1097/MCO.0b013e3283308dd6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To examine current evidence for dietary supplementation with
      zinc and other micronutrients for primary prevention of multiple micronutrient
      deficiencies that are known to result from therapies used in the treatment of
      gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiological
      observations and clinical findings have strengthened the concept that both
      nutritional deficiencies and nutritional excesses impair the gastrointestinal
      response(s) and alter susceptibility to inflammation and other diseases. The
      interaction of micronutrient intake, biochemical indicators of nutritional
      status, and four specific gastrointestinal inflammation states are reviewed.
      These conditions include celiac disease and concomitant micronutrient
      deficiencies resulting from the sustained adherence to a gluten-free diet;
      micronutrient nutrition as an important determinant of immunity for two major
      types of inflammatory bowel disease: ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease; and 
      HIV/AIDS-related diarrhea and concomitant micronutrient deficiencies which may be
      exacerbated by the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy. SUMMARY:
      For each inflammation 'state', enhancement of micronutrient status can improve
      immunocompetance and minimize therapeutic side-effects. The impact of
      single-micronutrient deficiencies on immune responses, and the possible impact of
      uncorrected micronutrient status are discussed.

PG  - 683-6
LID - 10.1586/eri.09.51 [doi]
AB  - Shiga toxin (Verocytotoxin)-producing Escherichia coli (STEC or VTEC) causes
      serious gastrointestinal infections in humans, including diarrhea and hemorrhagic
      colitis, and may lead to life-threatening sequelae such as the hemolytic uremic
      syndrome (HUS). The triennial 'VTEC' meetings provide a multidisciplinary forum
      for presentation of the latest research on all aspects of STEC, with sessions
      addressing epidemiology of human disease, animal reservoirs and transmission of
      STEC via the food chain, mechanisms of pathogenesis and host response, and
      control and prevention strategies. Management of patients with STEC disease can
      be challenging, particularly since conventional antibiotic therapy is
      contraindicated because it is believed to increase the risk of complications by
      promoting release of Shiga toxin by STEC in the gut. Accordingly, this report
      will focus on papers presented at the meeting that addressed development of
      alternative therapeutic strategies.

TI  - Bacillus polyfermenticus ameliorates colonic inflammation by promoting
      cytoprotective effects in colitic mice.

AB  - Although human consumption of Bacillus polyfermenticus provides several health
      benefits, the probiotic effect of this bacterium against colonic inflammation has
      not yet, to our knowledge, been studied. Therefore, we induced colitis in mice by
      oral or intrarectal administration of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) or
      trinitrobenzenosulfonic acid (TNBS), respectively, and investigated the effect of
      B. polyfermenticus on colitis. We found that mice treated with DSS or TNBS along 
      with B. polyfermenticus had reduced mortality and severity of colitis (weight
      loss, diarrhea, and mucosal damages) than mice treated with DSS or TNBS alone. B.
      polyfermenticus also reduced the expression of inflammatory molecules, including 
      chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1, intercellular adhesion molecule, and tumor
      necrosis factor-alpha, but enhanced the expression of the antiinflammatory
      cytokine interleukin-10 in the inflamed mouse colon. Moreover, B. polyfermenticus
      suppressed apoptosis both in vivo in inflamed colonic mucosa and in vitro in
      colonic epithelial cells stimulated with apoptosis-inducing agents (FasL or
      Clostridium difficile Toxin A) when the apoptotic response was determined by a
      terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay and cleavage
      of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase or caspase-3, respectively. Treating colonic
      epithelial cells with B. polyfermenticus-conditioned medium (BPCM) enhanced cell 
      proliferation and induced the phosphoinositide 3-kinases/Akt signaling pathway,
      suggesting that this bacterium can promote epithelial cell proliferation. BPCM
      also promoted the migration of colonic epithelial cells. These data suggest that 
      B. polyfermenticus ameliorates colonic inflammation by suppressing apoptosis and 
      promoting epithelial cell proliferation and migration.

PG  - 400-4
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181a0d269 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rifaximin, Food and Drug Administration approved for traveler's
      diarrhea, has been used in adult patients with active inflammatory bowel disease 
      (IBD). This retrospective review was undertaken to determine its role in the
      treatment of pediatric IBD. METHODS: A review of children with IBD, who were
      treated with rifaximin from 2005 to 2007 at our institution, was performed.
      Collected data included diagnosis, age, medication history, recent therapy,
      symptom, and interval to improvement. Response was rated as none, moderate, or
      optimum relief for each symptom. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were identified, 
      12 with Crohn disease and 11 with ulcerative colitis (UC) with a median age of 13
      years. The most common complaints were diarrhea in 20 patients (87%), abdominal
      pain in 17 (74%), and bloody stools in 15 (65%). Rifaximin was given at doses
      ranging between 10 and 30 mg/kg (Table 1). Of the 20 patients who presented with 
      diarrhea 5 (25%) had relief of diarrhea within 1 week of starting rifaximin and
      total of 12 patients (60%) experienced relief within 4 weeks. Abdominal pain
      resolved in 3 of 17 patients (17.6%) within 1 week and in 12 of 17 (70.6%) within
      4 weeks. Visible bleeding resolved in 10 of 15 patients (66.7%) within 4 weeks of
      therapy (Table 2). Analysis of concurrent medications showed 61% experienced
      relief of symptoms when addition of rifaximin was the only meaningful treatment
      change. CONCLUSIONS: Rifaximin was well-tolerated and showed favorable results.
      Larger doses of rifaximin were statistically better for abdominal pain. Further
      studies are needed to evaluate efficacy and optimal dosing of rifaximin in this
      population.

AB  - Verocytotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC), particularly serotype O157:H7, have
      recently emerged as an important group of food-borne pathogens in humans, causing
      diseases ranging from mild diarrhea to hemorrhagic colitis (HC), and
      complications such as hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic
      thrombocytopenic purpura, typically affecting children, the elderly, and
      immunocompromised patients. Since its identification as a pathogen in 1982, E.
      coli O157:H7 has been detected in many sporadic cases and outbreaks of HC and
      HUS, particularly in North America, the United Kingdom, and Japan. In Spain, VTEC
      is a relatively common cause of sporadic infection, and a total of 10 outbreaks
      have been reported to date. Thus, knowledge of the clinical and pathogenic
      aspects of these infections is of particular interest.

PG  - 505-21

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory disorder
      of the colon for which the etiology is currently unknown. At present, strategies 
      to treat UC are primarily targeted to control inflammation during active phases
      of disease as well as maintain remission during quiescence. As such, several
      unmet needs in the treatment of UC still remain. In recent years, basic research 
      has led to the recognition of several key factors in the pathogenesis of UC,
      translating into the development of several novel therapeutic agents. OBJECTIVE: 
      The aim of this study is to review emerging therapies that may advance the
      treatment and improve the overall care of UC patients. METHODS: An extensive
      literature search on published manuscripts and meeting proceedings has been
      performed to provide a comprehensive review of future drug therapies to treat UC.
      RESULTS/CONCLUSION: The translational application of new discoveries in the basic
      understanding of UC pathogenesis is continuing and critical for the development
      of novel treatment strategies. Design of novel biologic therapies to treat UC has
      the challenge of addressing potential safety issues, while more traditional drugs
      should be further developed to facilitate patient compliance to treat this
      chronic, debilitating disease.

PG  - Unit 5A.3
LID - 10.1002/9780471729259.mc05a03s14 [doi]
AB  - Escherichia coli are ubiquitous in the world, and for the most part are
      non-pathogenic and part of the normal lower gastrointestinal tract in mammals.
      However, some pathogenic isolates can cause severe disease that range from
      meningitis to hemorrhagic colitis (HC). In recent years, Shiga toxin-containing
      E. coli (STEC) have been a major cause of food borne and environmental cases of
      HC and hemolytic uremic syndrome. One STEC serotype, O157:H7, has been
      responsible for numerous food-associated outbreaks and recalls worldwide. The
      protocols in this unit will allow the reader to use real-time polymerase chain
      reaction genotyping to identify isolates that are more likely to cause disease in
      humans. The genotyping assay targets a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in
      the tir gene. The tir gene is located in a virulence operon called the locus for 
      enterocyte effacement and functions as a receptor for the tight adherence of E.
      coli O157:H7 to epithelial cells. As more genomes are sequenced, informative SNPs
      that associate with phenotypes will be identified. Identifying isolates not only 
      by their genus and species, but also by using other informative genomic traits
      will increase the general knowledge about their genetic diversity.

TI  - Gastrointestinal manifestations in primary immune disorders.
PG  - 703-11
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21040 [doi]
AB  - The gastrointestinal tract is the largest lymphoid organ in the body containing T
      and B lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Despite the fact that these 
      cells are constantly confronted with antigen primarily in the form of food and
      bacteria, immune responses in the gut are tightly regulated to maintain
      homeostasis. Without this balance of active immunity and tolerance, mucosal
      inflammation may ensue, and manifest as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis,
      pernicious anemia, or celiac sprue. Therefore, it is not unreasonable that
      inflammatory diseases of the gut are commonly encountered in patients with
      primary immune deficiencies. The exact pathogenesis of gastrointestinal diseases 
      in the setting of primary immunodeficiency remains unknown, however, both humoral
      and cell-mediated immunity appear to play a role in preventing intestinal
      inflammation. Patients presenting with atypical gastrointestinal disease and/or
      failure to respond to conventional therapy should be evaluated for an underlying 
      primary immune disorder in order to initiate appropriate treatment, such as
      immunoglobulin or in more severe cases bone marrow transplantation, to prevent
      long term complications.

      volunteers.
PG  - 256-62
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21042 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mesalamine and the probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) are both
      effective agents for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. A combined therapy may 
      have more than additive efficacy. However, mesalamine may have antimicrobial
      effects on EcN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective, randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 48 healthy volunteers took EcN in a
      run-in phase for 17 days (5-50 x 10(9) viable bacteria od). If stool samples
      became positive for EcN, volunteers received combination treatment with EcN plus 
      either mesalamine (1500 mg twice a day) or placebo for 1 week. Fecal samples were
      further tested for EcN in 2- to 3-day intervals until a maximum of 48 weeks after
      treatment. Patient diaries, blood, and urine were checked to assess safety,
      compliance, and tolerance. RESULTS: During run-in, viable EcN were detected in 45
      of the 48 volunteers (94%); 2 volunteers were positive before taking EcN. From
      days 1 to 7 of combination treatment (n = 40), the number of EcN-positive
      volunteers varied between 70% and 80% in the mesalamine group and between 85% and
      95% in the placebo group. Differences between the groups were not significant
      (normal approximation: day 3, P > 0.15; day 5, P > 0.25; day 7, P > 0.076). At
      treatment discontinuation, 16 of 20 volunteers in the mesalamine group and 15 of 
      20 volunteers in the placebo group were EcN positive, whereas this figure dropped
      continuously up to week 12 after discontinuation (mesalamine, 7 of 20; placebo, 4
      of 20). No differences between the groups were seen with regard to tolerance and 
      safety. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of EcN and mesalamine has no significant
      effect on the survival of EcN in healthy volunteers.

LID - 10.1016/j.cgh.2009.07.016 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Probiotics can maintain ulcerative colitis (UC) in remission
      effectively, but little is known of their ability to induce remission. We
      conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a 
      high-potency probiotic, VSL#3, for the treatment of mild-to-moderately active UC.
      METHODS: Adult patients with mild-to-moderate UC were assigned randomly to groups
      that were given 3.6 x 10(12) CFU VSL#3 (n = 77) or placebo (n = 70), twice daily 
      for 12 weeks. The primary end point was a 50% decrease in the Ulcerative Colitis 
      Disease Activity Index (UCDAI) at 6 weeks. The secondary end points included
      remission by 12 weeks and reduction in total individual UCDAI parameters from
      baseline at 12 weeks. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed. RESULTS: At week
      6, the percentage of patients with an improvement in UCDAI score that was greater
      than 50% was significantly higher in the group given VSL#3 (25; 32.5%) than the
      group given placebo (7; 10%) (P = .001). At week 12, there were 33 patients given
      VSL#3 (42.9%) who achieved remission, compared with 11 patients given placebo
      (15.7%) (P < .001). Furthermore, significantly more patients given VSL#3 (40;
      51.9%) achieved a decrease in their UCDAI that was greater than 3 points,
      compared with those given placebo (13; 18.6%) (P < .001). The VSL#3 group had
      significantly greater decreases in UCDAI scores and individual symptoms at weeks 
      6 and 12, compared with the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: VSL#3 is safe and
      effective in achieving clinical responses and remissions in patients with
      mild-to-moderately active UC.

TI  - Linoleic acid, a dietary n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid, and the aetiology of
      ulcerative colitis: a nested case-control study within a European prospective
      cohort study.
PG  - 1606-11
LID - 10.1136/gut.2008.169078 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Dietary linoleic acid, an n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid, is
      metabolised to arachidonic acid, a component of colonocyte membranes. Metabolites
      of arachidonic acid have pro-inflammatory properties and are increased in the
      mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis. The aim of this investigation was to 
      conduct the first prospective cohort study investigating if a high dietary intake
      of linoleic acid increases the risk of developing incident ulcerative colitis.
      DESIGN AND SETTING: Dietary data from food frequency questionnaires were
      available for 203 193 men and women aged 30-74 years, resident in the UK, Sweden,
      Denmark, Germany or Italy and participating in a prospective cohort study, the
      European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). These
      participants were followed up for the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. Each case 
      was matched with four controls and the risk of disease calculated by quartile of 
      intake of linoleic acid adjusted for gender, age, smoking, total energy intake
      and centre. RESULTS: A total of 126 participants developed ulcerative colitis
      (47% women) after a median follow-up of 4.0 years (range, 1.7-11.3 years). The
      highest quartile of intake of linoleic acid was associated with an increased risk
      of ulcerative colitis (odds ratio (OR) = 2.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) =
      1.23 to 5.07, p = 0.01) with a significant trend across quartiles (OR = 1.32 per 
      quartile increase, 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.66, p = 0.02 for trend). CONCLUSIONS: The
      data support a role for dietary linoleic acid in the aetiology of ulcerative
      colitis. An estimated 30% of cases could be attributed to having dietary intakes 
      higher than the lowest quartile of linoleic acid intake.

AB  - The term "probiotic" was first used in 1965, by Lilly and Stillwell, to describe 
      substances secreted by one organism which stimulate the growth of another. The
      use of antibiotics, immunosuppressive therapy and irradiation, amongst other
      means of treatment, may cause alterations in the composition and have an effect
      on the GIT flora. Therefore, the introduction of beneficial bacterial species to 
      GI tract may be a very attractive option to re-establish the microbial
      equilibrium and prevent disease. Prebiotic is a non-digestible food ingredient
      that confers benefits on the host by selectively stimulating one bacterium or a
      group of bacteria in the colon with probiotic properties. Both probiotics and
      prebiotics are together called as Synbiotics. Various bacterial genera most
      commonly used in probiotic preparations are Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium,
      Escherichia, Enterococcus, Bacillus and Streptococcus . Some fungal strains
      belonging to Saccharomyces have also been used. Probiotics have been shown to be 
      effective in varied clinical conditions- ranging from infantile diarrhoea,
      necrotizing enterocolitis, antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, relapsing Clostridium
      difficle colitis, Helicobacter pylori infections, inflammatory bowel disease to
      cancer, female uro-genital infection and surgical infections. Lactobacillus
      rhamnosus strain GG has proven beneficial affects on intestinal immunity. It
      increases the number of IgA and other immunoglobulins secreting cells in the
      intestinal mucosa. It also stimulates local release of interferons. It
      facilitates antigen transport to underlying lymphoid cells, which serves to
      increase antigen uptake in Peyer's patches. Probiotics are live microorganisms,
      so it is possible that they may result in infection in the host. The risk and
      morbidity of sepsis due to probiotic bacteria should be weighed against the
      potential for sepsis due to more pathological bacteria and the morbidity of
      diseases for which probiotic bacteria are being used as therapeutic agents. Also,
      future, well-designed placebo controlled studies with validated results are
      required for ascertaining the true health benefits of probiotics The important
      point in this regard is careful selection of the probiotic agent, its dose
      standardization and a thorough knowledge of its beneficial effects.

TI  - Potential for amino acids supplementation during inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 518-24
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21017 [doi]
AB  - The pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) is multifactorial and
      involves interactions of gut luminal content with mucosal barrier and especially 
      immune cells. Malnutrition is a frequent issue during IBD flares, especially in
      Crohn's disease (CD) patients, and nutritional support is frequently used to
      treat malnutrition but also in an attempt to modulate intestinal inflammation.
      The use of oral or enteral nutrition intervention in IBDs may be effective, alone
      or in combination with drugs, to achieve and maintain remission. However,
      standard diets are less effective than new-generation biotherapies and could be
      improved by supplementation with specific immunomodulatory amino acids.
      Experimental studies evaluating glutamine, the preferential substrate for
      enterocytes, are promising. Some clinical studies with oral glutamine in CD are
      until now disappointing, but new formulations and targeting could enhance
      glutamine efficacy at the site of mucosal lesions. The role of arginine, involved
      in nitric oxide and polyamines synthesis, still remains debated. However, the
      effects of these amino acids in IBD have been poorly documented in humans. Other 
      candidates like glycine, cysteine, histidine, or taurine should also be evaluated
      in the future.

TI  - Fish consumption and markers of colorectal cancer risk: a multicenter randomized 
      controlled trial.
PG  - 354-61
LID - 10.3945/ajcn.2009.27630 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diet is a major factor in the etiology of colorectal cancer, with
      high fish consumption possibly decreasing colorectal cancer risk, as was shown in
      several observational studies. To date, no intervention trials have examined the 
      possible beneficial effects of fish intake on colorectal cancer risk. OBJECTIVE: 
      The objective was to investigate the effects of a 6-mo intervention with oil-rich
      or lean fish on apoptosis and mitosis within the colonic crypt. DESIGN: In a
      multicenter, randomized, controlled intervention trial, patients with colorectal 
      polyps, inactive ulcerative colitis, or no macroscopic signs of disease were
      recruited (n = 242) and randomly allocated to receive dietary advice plus either 
      300 g oil-rich fish (salmon) per week (n = 82), 300 g lean fish (cod) per week (n
      = 78), or only dietary advice (DA) (n = 82). Apoptosis and mitosis were measured 
      in colonic biopsy samples collected before and after intervention (n = 213).
      RESULTS: The total number of apoptotic cells per crypt did not increase in the
      salmon or cod group: -0.10 (95% CI: -0.36, 0.16) and -0.06 (95% CI: -0.32, 0.20),
      respectively, compared with the DA group. The total number of mitotic cells per
      crypt decreased nonsignificantly in the salmon group (-0.87; 95% CI: -2.41, 0.68)
      and in the cod group (-1.04; 95% CI: -2.62, 0.53) compared with the DA group.
      Furthermore, the distribution of mitosis within the crypt did not significantly
      change in either group. CONCLUSION: An increase in the consumption of either
      oil-rich or lean fish to 2 portions weekly over 6 mo does not markedly change
      apoptotic and mitotic rates in the colonic mucosa. This trial was registered at
      www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00145015.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative
      colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal autoimmune condition with
      an inappropriate immune response. We investigated DNA damage induced in vitro in 
      lymphocytes from IBD patients caused by oxidative stress through H(2)O(2) and
      2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) and whether the plant flavonoids,
      quercetin and epicatechin, found in fruits, tea and soybeans could effectively
      reduce such stress. Lymphocytes from IBD patients and healthy volunteers were
      treated with 50 microg/ml H(2)O(2) or IQ in the presence of quercetin (0-250
      microg/ml) or epicatechin (0-100 microg/ml). Flavonoid supplementation (250
      microM quercetin or 100 microM epicatechin) caused an overall significant
      decrease of induced DNA damage resulting in a 48.6% (P < 0.001) reduction of
      H(2)O(2)-induced and a 43% (P < 0.001) reduction of IQ-induced DNA damage within 
      the patient groups; for the control groups, reductions in DNA damage were 35.2
      and 57.1%, respectively (both, P < 0.001). There was less induced DNA damage
      within lymphocytes from UC patients compared to CD patients for both series of
      experiments (H(2)O(2) and quercetin, IQ and epicatechin). In conclusion,
      flavonoids dramatically reduced oxidative stress in vitro in lymphocytes from IBD
      patients and healthy individuals. Thus, flavonoids could be very effective in the
      treatment of oxidative stress and encouraged in the diet of IBD patients.

PG  - 1-8

AB  - The berries of European elder are used in traditional German medicine for various
      complaints. Due to insufficient research data, elderberry fruit was not
      monographed by the German Commission E at the end of the last century. A
      comprehensive review of the literature was conducted to summarize the
      pharmacological and clinical effects of elderberry fruit. Several databases and
      other sources were searched to identify in vitro and animal studies, and clinical
      trials investigating elderberry fruit preparations. For the latter, the level of 
      evidence was evaluated as described previously. Elderberry fruit preparations may
      provide antioxidant, antiviral and antiproliferative effects in vitro. One animal
      experiment and one clinical trial were able to back the antioxidative impact in
      terms of a weak antilipidemic effect. Antibacterial and antiinflammatory effects 
      seem possible, but need further support. In rats, an aqueous elderberry fruit
      extract produced central depression and analgesia and an ethanol fruit extract
      improved acetic acid-induced colitis. Several in vitro studies together with two 
      exploratory studies in humans and one open study in chimpanzees indicate that the
      aqueous elderberry extract Sambucol may be useful for the treatment of viral
      influenza infections. These promising effects of elderberry fruit preparations
      from experimental and clinical studies should be backed by more rigorous studies 
      before these preparations are recommended in the prevention of diseases and in
      treatment schedules.

PG  - 175-82

AB  - Probiotic bacteria, commensals selected for their presumed therapeutic properties
      when ingested orally, have attracted increasing attention for their possible
      efficacy in a range of gastrointestinal disorders, including the inflammatory
      bowel diseases of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Since the barrier
      properties of the intestinal epithelium are believed to be compromised as a
      consequence (or perhaps as a cause) of intestinal inflammation, we hypothesized
      that probiotics might ameliorate such epithelial dysfunction as part of their
      spectrum of beneficial effects. We have used both cell line and animal models to 
      test this hypothesis and show that two probiotics have significant effects on
      epithelial barrier properties, both at baseline and when deranged by inflammatory
      cytokines or in the setting of inflammation in a mouse model of colitis.
      Moreover, the probiotics also normalize epithelial ion transport function, which 
      could also contribute to clinical efficacy. Overall, our studies extend the
      spectrum of functional effects attributable to probiotics, and may provide a
      rationale for their use in a range of gastrointestinal disorders associated with 
      epithelial dysfunction.

TI  - Curcumin has bright prospects for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 2087-94
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic relapsing-remitting condition that 
      afflicts millions of people throughout the world and impairs their daily
      functions and quality of life. While the aetiology of IBD is not understood well,
      it appears to be driven by inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF)-alpha. Hence, there is a strong interest in agents that can block the
      generation or actions of inflammatory cytokines. Curcumin is a bioactive
      substance present in the rhizomes of the herb "Curcuma longa" which has been used
      for centuries in Asia, both in traditional medicine and in cooking as turmeric
      which gives food an exotic natural yellow color. Further, in recent years, a
      large number of research papers have reported intriguing pharmacologic effects
      associated with curcumin. These include inhibitory effects on cyclooxygenases 1, 
      2 (COX-1, COX-2), lipoxygenase (LOX), TNF-alpha, interferon gamma (IFN-gamma),
      inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and the transcriptional nuclear factor
      kappa B (NF-kappaB), in addition to a strong anti-oxidant effect. NF-kappaB is a 
      key factor in the upregulation of inflammatory cytokines that have a high profile
      in inflammatory diseases, suggesting that curcumin could be a novel therapeutic
      agent for patients with IBD. Therefore, in recent years, the efficacy of curcumin
      has been investigated in several experimental models of IBD. The results indicate
      striking suppression of induced IBD colitis and changes in cytokine profiles,
      from the pro-inflammatory Th1 to the anti-inflammatory Th2 type. In human IBD, up
      to now, only one open study has achieved encouraging results. In this study,
      patients were given curcumin (360 mg/dose) 3 or 4 times/day for three months.
      Further, curcumin significantly reduced clinical relapse in patients with
      quiescent IBD. The inhibitory effects of curcumin on major inflammatory
      mechanisms like COX-2, LOX, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, NF-kappaB and its unrivalled
      safety profile suggest that it has bright prospects in the treatment of IBD.
      However, randomized controlled clinical investigations in large cohorts of
      patients are needed to fully evaluate the clinical potential of curcumin.

TI  - The therapeutic impact of manipulating microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 2074-86
AB  - It is well established that intestinal microbiota play an important role in the
      pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis
      and Crohn's disease. Various methods of altering the composition of intestinal
      microbiota have been examined. Recent evidence suggests that the administration
      of select prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics may improve the clinical outcome 
      of patients with IBD. In addition, IBD patients are well known to carry a higher 
      risk of developing colorectal cancer due to chronic inflammation. Therefore,
      probiotics and/or prebiotics may be appropriate treatments for prophylactic use
      due to their physiologic characteristics and lack of obvious toxicity. This
      review summarizes the current experimental and clinical knowledge about the role 
      of intestinal microbiota in IBD, the prevention of carcinogenesis related to IBD,
      and its importance as a target for new forms of neutraceutical therapy.

TI  - Targeting the human microbiome with antibiotics, probiotics, and prebiotics:
      gastroenterology enters the metagenomics era.
PG  - 2015-31
AB  - Studies of metagenomics and the human microbiome will tremendously expand our
      knowledge of the composition of microbial communities in the human body. As our
      understanding of microbial variation and corresponding genetic parameters is
      refined, this information can be applied to rational remodeling or "tailoring" of
      human-associated microbial communities and their associated functions.
      Physiologic features such as the development of innate and adaptive immunity,
      relative susceptibilities to infections, immune tolerance, bioavailability of
      nutrients, and intestinal barrier function may be modified by changing the
      composition and functions of the microbial communities. The specialty of
      gastroenterology will be affected profoundly by the ability to modify the
      gastrointestinal microbiota through the rational deployment of antibiotics,
      probiotics, and prebiotics. Antibiotics might be used to remove or suppress
      undesirable components of the human microbiome. Probiotics can introduce missing 
      microbial components with known beneficial functions for the human host.
      Prebiotics can enhance the proliferation of beneficial microbes or probiotics, to
      maximize sustainable changes in the human microbiome. Combinations of these
      approaches might provide synergistic and effective therapies for specific
      disorders. The human microbiome could be manipulated by such "smart" strategies
      to prevent and treat acute gastroenteritis, antibiotic-associated diarrhea and
      colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, necrotizing
      enterocolitis, and a variety of other disorders.

      secretion induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha in Caco-2 cells; however, the
      conditioned medium from OLL2838 did not show any effect on barrier functions. The
      in vivo effects of OLL2838 on intestinal epithelial barrier function and colonic 
      inflammation were assessed in DSS-induced colitis of BALB/c mice. Oral treatment 
      with both live and heat-killed OLL2838 suppressed weight loss and recovered colon
      length. Additionally, barrier function was restored by the administration of live
      and heat-killed OLL2838 to the DSS-treated animals, which conferred protection
      against the increase in mucosal permeability associated with DSS-induced colitis.
      This may at least partially be because of the increased expression of zonula
      occludens-1 (4.8-fold) and myosin light-chain kinase (3.1-fold) in intestinal
      epithelial cells isolated from mice of the heat-killed OLL2838 group. Therefore, 
      L. rhamnosus OLL2838 would be useful in the treatment of gastrointestinal
      diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Antibiotics and probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease: why, when, and how.
PG  - 329-33
LID - 10.1097/MOG.0b013e32832b20bf [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize recent evidence on the role of intestinal
      bacteria in inflammatory bowel diseases, and of antibiotics and probiotics in
      their treatment. The implications connected with the use of antibiotics are also 
      examined. RECENT FINDINGS: The hypothesis that Mycobacterium paratuberculosis
      could be a causative agent of Crohn's disease has not been confirmed by a large
      trial on symptomatic patients treated by a combination of antibiotics active
      against this bacterium. An increased number of adherent-invasive Escherichia coli
      have been found in the intestinal tissue of patients with Crohn's disease, but
      their role in the pathogenesis of this condition remains to be defined. The
      combination of metronidazole and azathioprine, associating the effects of a
      reduced bacterial load with immunosuppression, appears to be a therapeutic option
      to decrease the recurrence of postoperative Crohn's disease in high-risk
      patients. However, concerns are raised by the possibility that antibiotics may
      induce disease relapse due to Clostridium difficile infection. SUMMARY: Recent
      literature provides increasing support for the use of antibiotics in Crohn's
      disease, although the side effects limit their long-term use. The efficacy of
      antibiotics in ulcerative colitis is not confirmed by the available literature,
      except in severe colitis. More trials are needed to support the use of probiotics
      as therapy in inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - The gut microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1528-36
AB  - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the two principal forms of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The root causes of these chronic and acute
      immunological disorders are unclear, but intestinal microorganisms are known to
      play a key role in the initiation and maintenance of disease. However, at
      present, there is no clear evidence for a single transmissible agent being
      involved in IBD aetiology. Although marked alterations occur in faecal and
      mucosal bacterial communities in IBD, it is unclear whether they are responsible 
      for causing disease, or are due to changes in the gut environment that result
      from inflammatory reactions and extensive tissue destruction. Despite the
      involvement of microorganisms in inflammatory processes, antibiotic therapy has
      generally been unsuccessful in IBD. However, recent studies involving the use of 
      probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics suggest that there is potential for
      controlling these diseases through manipulation of the composition of the gut
      microbiota, and direct interactions with the gut immune system.

TI  - Probiotics, immune function, infection and inflammation: a review of the evidence
      from studies conducted in humans.
PG  - 1428-518
AB  - A number of studies have been performed examining the influence of various
      probiotic organisms, either alone or in combination, on immune parameters,
      infectious outcomes, and inflammatory conditions in humans. Some components of
      the immune response, including phagocytosis, natural killer cell activity and
      mucosal immunoglobulin A production (especially in children), can be improved by 
      some probiotic bacteria. Other components, including lymphocyte proliferation,
      the production of cytokines and of antibodies other than immunoglobulin A appear 
      less sensitive to probiotics. Probiotics, including lactobacilli and
      bifidobacteria, administered to children can reduce incidence and duration of
      diarrhoea, but the precise effects depend upon the nature of the condition.
      Probiotic supplementation can reduce the risk of travellers' diarrhoea in adults,
      but does not affect duration. The effect of probiotics on other infectious
      outcomes is less clear. Probiotics may benefit children and adults with irritable
      bowel syndrome and adults with ulcerative colitis; studies in Crohn's Disease are
      less clear. Probiotics have little effect in rheumatoid arthritis. Probiotic
      supplementation, especially with lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, can reduce risk
      and severity of allergic disease, particular atopic dermatitis; early
      supplementation appears to be effective. Overall, the picture that emerges from
      studies of probiotics on immune, infectious and inflammatory outcomes in humans
      is mixed and there appear to be large species and strain differences in effects
      seen. Other reasons for differences in effects seen will include dose of
      probiotic organism used, duration of supplementation, characteristics of the
      subjects studied, sample size, and technical differences in how the measurements 
      were made.

TI  - Effect of Candida colonization on human ulcerative colitis and the healing of
      inflammatory changes of the colon in the experimental model of colitis ulcerosa.
PG  - 107-18
AB  - The influence of fungal colonization on the course of ulcerative colitis (UC) has
      not been thoroughly studied. We determined the activity of the disease using
      clinical, endoscopic and histological index (IACH) criteria in UC patients with
      fungal colonization and the healing process of UC induced by an intrarectal
      administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) in rats infected with
      Candida, without and with antifungal (fluconazole) or probiotic (lacidofil)
      treatment. The intensity of the healing of the colonic lesions was assessed by
      macro- and microscopic criteria as well as functional alterations in colonic
      blood flow (CBF). Myeloperoxidase (MPO) content and plasma proinflammatory
      cytokines IL-1beta and TNF-alpha levels were evaluated. Candida more frequently
      colonized patients with a history of UC within a 5-year period, when compared
      with those of shorter duration of IBS. Among Candida strains colonizing
      intestinal mucosa, Candida albicans was identified in 91% of cases. Significant
      inhibition of the UC activity index as reflected by clinical, endoscopical and
      histological criteria was observed in the Candida group treated with fluconazole,
      when compared to that without antifungal treatment. In the animal model, Candida 
      infection significantly delayed the healing of TNBS-induced UC, decreased the CBF
      and raised the plasma IL-1beta and TNF-alpha levels, with these effects reversed 
      by fluconazole or lacidofil treatment. We conclude that 1) Candida delays healing
      of UC in both humans and that induced by TNBS in rats, and 2) antifungal therapy 
      and probiotic treatment during Candida infection could be beneficial in the
      restoration and healing of colonic damage in UC.

TI  - Rapid and sensitive detection of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli from
      nonenriched stool specimens by real-time PCR in comparison to enzyme immunoassay 
      and culture.
PG  - 2008-12
LID - 10.1128/JCM.02013-08 [doi]
AB  - Shiga toxin (Stx)-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) bacteria are a frequent cause
      of food-borne gastroenteritis, hemorrhagic colitis, and hemolytic uremic
      syndrome. Because antimicrobial agents are generally contraindicated in patients 
      infected with STEC, a sensitive and specific diagnostic test with rapid
      turnaround is essential. Current culture methods may fail to detect non-O157
      STEC. We evaluated a Stx gene real-time PCR assay using hybridization probes and 
      the LightCycler instrument with 204 prospectively collected stool specimens,
      which were also tested for Stx by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) (ProSpecT STEC; Remel,
      Lenexa, KS) and by culturing on chromogenic agar (Chromagar O157; BD BBL, Sparks,
      MD). In addition, 85 archived stool specimens previously tested for Stx (by EIA) 
      and/or E. coli O157:H7 (by culture) were tested by PCR. Sample preparation for
      PCR included mixing the stool in sterile water and extraction of nucleic acid
      using the MagNA Pure LC instrument (Roche Diagnostics). The PCR assay had 100%
      sensitivity and specificity compared to EIA and culture for specimens collected
      prospectively (4 of 204 specimens were positive) and compared to culture and/or
      EIA for archival specimens (42 of 85 specimens were positive). Both the EIA and
      PCR produced positive results from a specimen containing an O103 serotype STEC in
      the prospective specimens, and the PCR test detected three positive specimens
      that contained nonviable STEC in the archived specimens. The PCR assay
      demonstrated 100% sensitivity and specificity compared to EIA and/or culture and 
      more rapid turnaround than either EIA or culture.

      mice.
PG  - 835-41
LID - 10.1016/j.micinf.2009.04.024 [doi]
AB  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is an important food-borne pathogen,
      which causes a wide spectrum of diseases ranging from hemorrhagic colitis to
      life-threatening hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Currently, insufficient
      measures to prevent and treat EHEC infection make a vaccine against EHEC in great
      demand. EspA (E. coli secreted protein A), intimin, and Stx2 (Shiga toxin 2) are 
      three predominant virulence factors of EHEC, and each of them has proved to be
      capable of inducing partial protective immunity. In this study, we constructed a 
      trivalent recombinant protein designated EIS that is composed of EspA (E),
      C-terminal 300 amino acids of intimin (I) and B subunit of Stx2 (S), and tested
      it as vaccine using a mouse model. Our results showed that immunization of EIS
      induced strong humoral response to EspA, intimin and Stx2 and protected mice
      against the challenges with live EHEC or EHEC sonicated lysate. Moreover, it
      enhanced clearance of intestinally colonized bacteria. This work suggests that
      for EHEC vaccines using a combination of EspA, intimin and Stx2 antigens appears 
      to be more effective than using any of these immunogens alone.

TI  - Use of probiotics in the management of chemotherapy-induced diarrhea: a case
      study.
PG  - 569-70
LID - 10.1177/0148607109332004 [doi]
AB  - Gastrointestinal disturbances (particularly diarrhea) are often induced in
      response to cancer treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation. Oral
      chemotherapeutic agents can induce diarrhea by damaging the intestinal lining.
      Two common oral drugs used in cancer treatment that are known to have
      gastrointestinal side effects are capecitabine and lapatinib. In this brief
      communication, the authors discuss a case study of a stage IV breast cancer
      patient whose chemotherapy-induced diarrhea was treated successfully with a
      multispecies combination of probiotics. This is a unique study in which grade 3
      chemotherapy-induced diarrhea (characterized by 7-9 stools per day and associated
      with incontinence and abdominal cramping) was treated with only a multispecies
      combination of probiotics. Probiotics have been used to treat diarrhea in
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, and
      Crohn's disease. More recently, probiotics have been used to treat
      chemotherapy-induced diarrhea in colon cancer patients. This case study
      demonstrates that the probiotics can also be used to treat severe cases of
      chemotherapy-induced diarrhea in breast cancer patients. The use of different
      probiotics in gastrointestinal diseases is an increasingly important area of
      study, and more research into this area is needed. This study demonstrates that
      probiotics should be considered for advanced breast cancer patients with
      chemotherapy-induced diarrhea.

TI  - Outbreak of Clostridium difficile 027 infection in Vienna, Austria 2008-2009.
LID - 19186 [pii]
AB  - From November 2008 to 15 April 2009, 36 isolates of CD027 identified in Austria, 
      all originating from four hospitals in Vienna. All isolates were positive for
      toxin A, toxin B and the binary toxin, and showed a characteristic 18 bp deletion
      in the tcdC gene. Clostridium difficile is an anaerobic spore-forming bacterium. 
      Some strains may cause diarrhoea due to formation of toxins. Symptomatic C.
      difficile infection (CDI) is primarily linked with hospital admission and
      antibiotic treatment, although antibiotic exposure is neither necessary nor
      sufficient for CDI [1,2]. In Belgium, for instance, one third of CDI cases
      reported in the hospital surveillance system are not hospital-associated [3].
      Symptoms range from mild diarrhoea to serious manifestations such as
      pseudomembranous colitis, toxic megacolon or perforation of the colon. C.
      difficile challenges hygiene standards as it is forms spores. The risk of
      infection rises with increasing age, underlying disease and immunodeficiency [4].
      In recent years, a particularly virulent strain, ribotype 027 (CD027), has
      emerged in a number of countries, particularly in connection with hospital
      outbreaks, but also in community-acquired diarrhoea cases [5]. The risk of
      serious disease and death associated with CD027 exceeds that of other C.
      difficile strains. The classical CD027 is characterised - among other things - by
      an increased production of toxins A and B, production of a binary toxin and
      resistance to newer fluoroquinolones such as moxifloxacin. The first three
      Austrian cases of CD027 occurred in 2006 and in March 2008 [6,7]. Since August
      2006, the Austrian National Reference Centre for C. difficile has ribotyped
      approximately 2,700 human C. difficile isolates received from all nine Austrian
      provinces. In recent months, a drastic increase in CD027 cases has been noted,
      all originating from four hospitals in Vienna. From November 2008 to 15 April
      2009, 36 isolates of CD027 were received at the National Reference Centre. The
      Figure summarises these C. difficile 027 cases by month of reception of the
      sample at the reference centre.

      enterotoxicity.
PG  - 218-25

AB  - Clostridium difficile is responsible for a large proportion of nosocomial cases
      of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and pseudomembranous colitis. The present
      study provides evidence that yeast, beef and pork extracts, ingredients commonly 
      used to grow bacteria, can counteract C. difficile toxin A enterotoxicity in
      vitro and in vivo. In model intestinal epithelial cells the individual extracts
      could prevent the toxin A-induced decrease in epithelial barrier function and
      partially prevented actin disaggregation and cell rounding. Mice with ad libitum 
      access to individual extracts for 1 week had almost complete reduction in toxin
      A-induced fluid secretion in intestinal loops. Concomitantly, the toxin A-induced
      expression of the essential proinflammatory mediator Cox-2 was normalized.
      Moreover this protective effect was also seen when mice received only two doses
      of extract by intragastric gavage within 1 week. These results show that yeast,
      beef and pork extracts have the potential to counteract the intestinal
      pathogenesis triggered by C. difficile toxin A.

PG  - 360-70
LID - 10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.04.011 [doi]
AB  - Escherichia coli O157:H7 and other Verocytotoxin-producing E. coli (VTEC) are
      zoonotic pathogens associated with food and waterborne illness around the world. 
      E. coli O157:H7 has been implicated in large outbreaks as well as in sporadic
      cases of haemorrhagic colitis and the sometimes fatal haemolytic uremic syndrome.
      VTs produced by these bacteria are thought to damage host endothelial cells in
      small vessels of the intestine, kidney and brain resulting in thrombotic
      microangiopathy. All VTs have the same subunit structure, glycolipid cell
      receptor and inhibit protein synthesis. During VTEC infection, it is thought one 
      or more bacterial adhesins initiates colonization and establishes intimate
      attachment and is responsible for the translocation of a variety of effectors
      which alter the structure and function of host cells. VTEC are widespread in
      animals but ruminants are thought to be their natural reservoir. E. coli O157:H7 
      colonizes the terminal colon of cattle and can be shed in very large numbers by
      specific herdmates known as "supershedders". Faeces containing these organisms
      act as a source of contamination for a variety of foods and the environment. Many
      VTEC control efforts have been investigated along the "farm to fork" continuum
      including, vaccination of cattle with colonization factors, and the use of novel 
      antimicrobials, such as bacteriocins, chloral hydrate, bacteriophage and
      substances which disrupt quorum sensing. In addition, many barriers have been
      developed for use in the slaughter and food processing industry such as steam
      pasteurization and irradiation. Despite these efforts many scientific, technical 
      and regulatory challenges remain in the control and prevention of VTEC-associated
      human illness.

      colitis.
PG  - 640-5
LID - 10.1007/DCR.0b013e31819d47b5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess the feasibility and safety of undergoing
      emergency subtotal colectomy with hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery in patients 
      with severe ulcerative colitis. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 60
      patients who underwent emergency subtotal colectomy with hand-assisted
      laparoscopic technique (30 cases) or open technique (30 cases) for severe
      ulcerative colitis. RESULTS: No intraoperative complications occurred in either
      group. One patient in the laparoscopic group required conversion to open surgery.
      The median operative time was significantly longer in the laparoscopic group (242
      vs. 191 minutes; P < 0.001). The rate of early postoperative complications in the
      laparoscopic group was significantly less than that in the open group (37 percent
      vs. 63 percent; P = 0.041). In the open group, four patients required
      relaparotomy because of peritoneal abscess or strangulation ileus, whereas no
      patient required relaparotomy in the laparoscopic group (P = 0.040). In the
      laparoscopic group, the median duration of postoperative food prohibition was
      significantly shorter (4.8 vs. 5.9 days; P = 0.007), and the median length of
      hospital stay was significantly shorter (23.0 vs. 33.0 days; P = 0.001).
      CONCLUSIONS: Although the operative time was elongated in the laparoscopic group,
      intraoperative safety and postoperative recovery were satisfactory. For severe
      ulcerative colitis, hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery can be an alternative to
      conventional open surgery.

TI  - Selected topics in the evaluation of pediatric gastrointestinal mucosal biopsies.
PG  - 154-60
LID - 10.1097/PAP.0b013e3181a12dec [doi]
AB  - The practice of pediatric gastrointestinal pathology provides specific challenges
      to the pathologist. Often the clinical information accompanying a biopsy specimen
      will read simply, "failure to thrive." Other situations, such as the evaluation
      of a neonate's rectal suction biopsy for Hirschsprung disease, are notorious for 
      providing diagnostic challenges in high-pressure situations. In this review, we
      will discuss several commonly encountered situations in pediatric pathology: the 
      evaluation of pediatric esophageal eosinophilia, a child who has swallowed a non 
      food item, caustic substance, or hot liquid, the evaluation of a pediatric
      colorectal biopsy with focal active colitis, and the evaluation of rectal suction
      biopsies for Hirschsprung disease. With each topic, we will discuss a general
      approach to the case, diagnostic tips, and how to avoid commonly encountered
      pitfalls. Finally, we highlight key references pertinent to these issues that can
      he used to help convey pathologic findings to pediatric gastroenterologists.

AB  - Aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is complex and probably
      multifactorial. Nutrition has been proposed to be an important aetiological
      factor for development of IBD. Several components of the diet (such as sugar,
      fat, fibre, fruit and vegetable, protein, fast food, preservatives etc.) were
      examined as possible causative agents for IBD. According to some researchers
      infant feeding (breast feeding) may also contribute to the development of IBD.
      Though the importance of environmental factors is evidenced by the increasing
      incidence in developed countries and in migrant population in recent decades, the
      aetiology of IBD remained unclear. There are many theories, but as yet no dietary
      approaches have been proved to reduce the risk of developing IBD. The role of
      nutrition in the management of IBD is better understood. The prevention and
      correction of malnutrition, the provision of macro- and micronutrients and
      vitamins and the promotion of optimal growth and development of children are key 
      points of nutritional therapy. In active disease, the effective support of energy
      and nutrients is a very important part of the therapy. Natural and artificial
      nutrition or the combination of two can be chosen for supporting therapy of IBD. 
      The author summarises the aetiological and therapeutic role of nutrition in IBD.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The authors present evidence published during the past 2 years
      of the roles of commensal and pathogenic bacteria in the pathogenesis of the
      inflammatory bowel diseases. RECENT FINDINGS: Rodent models conclusively
      implicate commensal enteric bacteria in chronic, immune-mediated, experimental
      colitis, and genetically determined defects in bacterial killing by innate immune
      cells are found in a subset of patients with Crohn's disease. There is no
      evidence that a single pathogen, including Mycobacterium avium subspecies
      paratuberculosis, causes Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. However,
      adherent/invasive Escherichia coli are associated with ileal Crohn's disease,
      with the mechanisms and genetics of adherent/invasive E. coli virulence being
      elucidated. Molecular characterization of the microbiota in patients with
      inflammatory bowel diseases reveals decreased biodiversity of commensal bacteria,
      most notably the phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, including the clinically
      relevant Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and increased E. coli concentrations.
      VSL#3 is one probiotic preparation shown to be efficacious in certain clinical
      situations in small clinical trials. SUMMARY: Further characterization of altered
      microbiota in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases and linking dysbiosis
      with host genetic alterations in immunoregulation, innate microbial killing and
      barrier function are critical, so that individualized treatments to increase
      beneficial commensals and their metabolic products (probiotic and prebiotic
      administration) and diminish deleterious species such as adherent/invasive E.
      coli can be tailored for defined patient subsets.

TI  - Food allergy and autism spectrum disorders: is there a link?
PG  - 194-201
AB  - Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are common comorbidities in children with autism
      spectrum disorders (ASDs). Parents often attribute these GI symptoms to food
      allergy (FA), although an evaluation for IgE-mediated FA is often unrevealing.
      Our previous studies indicated a high prevalence of non-IgE-mediated FA in young 
      children with ASDs. Therefore, non-IgE-mediated FA may account for some but not
      all GI symptoms observed in children with ASDs. This raises the question of what 
      treatment measures are applicable to ASD children with GI symptoms. A wide
      variety of dietary supplements and dietary intervention measures for ASD children
      have been promoted by medical professionals practicing complementary and
      alternative medicine despite the lack of rigorous scientific validation in most
      instances. This review summarizes possible (or proposed) etiologies of GI
      symptoms in ASD children and discusses risks and possible benefits of
      intervention measures promoted by complementary and alternative practitioners,
      with emphasis on FA.

TI  - Clostridium difficile associated infection, diarrhea and colitis.
PG  - 1554-80
AB  - A new, hypervirulent strain of Clostridium difficile, called NAP1/BI/027, has
      been implicated in C. difficile outbreaks associated with increased morbidity and
      mortality since the early 2000s. The epidemic strain is resistant to
      fluoroquinolones in vitro, which was infrequent prior to 2001. The name of this
      strain reflects its characteristics, demonstrated by different typing methods:
      pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (NAP1), restriction endonuclease analysis (BI)
      and polymerase chain reaction (027). In 2004 and 2005, the US Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention (CDC) emphasized that the risk of C. difficile-associated 
      diarrhea (CDAD) is increased, not only by the usual factors, including antibiotic
      exposure, but also gastrointestinal surgery/manipulation, prolonged length of
      stay in a healthcare setting, serious underlying illness, immune-compromising
      conditions, and aging. Patients on proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have an elevated
      risk, as do peripartum women and heart transplant recipients. Before 2002, toxic 
      megacolon in C. difficile-associated colitis (CDAC), was rare, but its incidence 
      has increased dramatically. Up to two-thirds of hospitalized patients may be
      infected with C. difficile. Asymptomatic carriers admitted to healthcare
      facilities can transmit the organism to other susceptible patients, thereby
      becoming vectors. Fulminant colitis is reported more frequently during outbreaks 
      of C. difficile infection in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). C.
      difficile infection with IBD carries a higher mortality than without underlying
      IBD. This article reviews the latest information on C. difficile infection,
      including presentation, vulnerable hosts and choice of antibiotics, alternative
      therapies, and probiotics and immunotherapy. We review contact precautions for
      patients with known or suspected C. difficile-associated disease. Healthcare
      institutions require accurate and rapid diagnosis for early detection of possible
      outbreaks, to initiate specific therapy and implement effective control measures.
      A comprehensive C. difficile infection control management rapid response team
      (RRT) is recommended for each health care facility. A communication network
      between RRTs is recommended, in coordination with each country's department of
      health. Our aim is to convey a comprehensive source of information and to guide
      healthcare professionals in the difficult decisions that they face when caring
      for these oftentimes very ill patients.

TI  - Colon in food allergy.
PG  - S89-91
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181a15d1a [doi]
AB  - The colon is a site of allergic reaction to food proteins. The most common
      manifestation is allergic proctocolitis. Although frequent in infancy, it may
      also affect older children. The diagnosis of allergic proctocolitis is mainly
      based on clinical and histological grounds, but there is a risk of overdiagnosis;
      challenge is strongly recommended to avoid unnecessary and expensive formula or
      changes in maternal diet that may discourage continuation of breast-feeding. The 
      benign clinical course and the spontaneous resolution in most infants suggest the
      need for further prospective studies to validate markers that allow the
      identification of those children needing a dietary approach. It remains to be
      assessed whether lymphoid nodular hyperplasia of the colon is a manifestation of 
      food allergy. Finally, allergic proctitis may present clinically with refractory 
      constipation; the true prevalence of food allergy-related constipation remains to
      be assessed.

TI  - Nutritional aspects in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - S86-8
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181a15ca0 [doi]
AB  - Nutrition plays a role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) primarily in
      prevention and treatment of malnutrition and growth failure. Furthermore, in
      Crohn disease (CD), nutrition can induce remission, maintain remission, and
      prevent relapse. Malnutrition is common in IBD and the mechanisms involved
      include decreased food intake, malabsorption, increased nutrient loss, increased 
      energy requirements, and drug-nutrient interactions. At the time of diagnosis, up
      to 85% of pediatric patients with CD and 65% of those with ulcerative colitis
      (UC) have weight loss. Growth failure occurs in 15% to 40% of children with IBD
      and is less common in UC compared with CD, both at diagnosis and during
      follow-up. In CD, nutritional therapy with enteral formulas induces remission at 
      a rate comparable with that achieved with steroids. In adults with CD, limited
      information suggests that enteral nutrition (EN) may play a role in maintenance
      of remission. In children with CD colitis, one study suggested that children
      without colitis respond better to EN than children with colitis, and another
      study found no such difference but reported a trend toward earlier relapse in
      those with isolated colonic involvement. Finally, nutrition may play a role in
      IBD via the possible protective effect of breastfeeding against UC and CD. In
      summary, although only CD may benefit from nutrition as primary therapy for
      remission induction and possibly maintenance of remission, nutrition plays an
      important role in the prevention and treatment of malnutrition in IBD, and may
      have a protective role, via the effect of breast-feeding on disease occurrence.

TI  - The vexed relationship between Clostridium difficile and inflammatory bowel
      disease: an assessment of carriage in an outpatient setting among patients in
      remission.
PG  - 1162-9
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2009.4 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Comorbidity with Clostridium difficile may cause diagnostic delay in 
      newly presenting inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, trigger relapse in
      established disease, confound therapies, and serve as an indicator of an
      underlying defect in innate immunity. Retrospective analyses have suggested
      community acquisition; to address this we conducted a prospective analysis of C. 
      difficile carriage in IBD patients using molecular methods specifically in an
      outpatient setting. METHODS: Recruited participants had long-standing diagnoses
      of ulcerative colitis (n = 64) and Crohn's disease (n = 58), were in clinical
      remission, and had no recent exposure to antibiotics, corticosteroids,
      immunomodulatory drugs or recent hospitalization. Isolates were cultured from
      stools and confirmed by 16S sequencing. The antibiotic susceptibilities of the
      isolates were tested followed by further strain characterization by toxinotyping,
      ribotyping, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). RESULTS: The frequency
      of toxigenic C. difficile was higher in IBD patients than in healthy volunteers
      at 8.2 and 1.0%, respectively (P = 0.02 Fisher's exact test). All strains
      belonged to toxinotype 0 with rare subtypes of this group noted in five isolates 
      and represented by an altered repressor genotype. Patients harbored a diverse
      range of toxigenic ribotype groups, including those previously associated with C.
      difficile-associated disease (CDAD) (R015, R005, and R020) and the rarer types
      R062, R050, and R003. Interestingly, common nosocomial groups were not
      identified. The considerable nonclonal distribution of distinct strains was
      further demonstrated by PFGE genomic fingerprinting. None of the study subjects
      experienced a clinical episode of CDAD during a 6-month period of follow-up.
      CONCLUSIONS: Detection of C. difficile is increased in IBD outpatients in
      remission, and strain diversity is consistent with community acquisition from a
      multitude of sources.

AB  - Susceptibility to inflammatory bowel diseases depends upon interactions between
      the genetics of the individual and induction of chronic mucosal inflammation. We 
      hypothesized that administration of dietary phenolics, caffeic acid and rutin,
      would suppress upregulation of inflammatory markers and intestinal damage in a
      mouse model of colitis. Colitis was induced in C3H/ HeOuJ mice (8 weeks old, 6
      male/6 female per treatment) with 1.25% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 6 d in
      their drinking water. Rutin (1.0 mmol (524 mg)/kg in diet), caffeic acid (1.0
      mmol (179 mg)/kg in diet), and hypoxoside extract (15 mg/d, an anticolitic
      phenolic control) were fed to the mice for 7 d before and during DSS treatment,
      as well as without DSS treatment. Body weight loss was prevented by rutin and
      caffeic acid during DSS treatment. Colon lengths in mice fed caffeic acid and
      hypoxoside during DSS treatment were similar to DSS-negative control. Food intake
      was improved and myeloperoxidase (MPO) was decreased with each phenolic treatment
      in DSS-treated mice compared with DSS treatment alone. Colonic mRNA expression of
      IL-17 and iNOS were inhibited when IL-4 was increased by each phenolic treatment 
      combined with DSS, whereas CYP4B1 mRNA was increased only by caffeic acid in
      DSS-treated mice, compared with DSS treatment alone. Colonic and cecal
      histopathology scores of DSS-treated mice were significantly more severe (P <
      0.01) than in mice fed caffeic acid before and during DSS treatment, based on
      mucosal height, necrosis, edema, erosion, and inflammatory cell infiltration.
      Although both rutin and caffeic acid suppressed the expression of selected
      inflammatory markers, only caffeic acid protected against DSS-induced colitis, in
      association with normalization of CYP4B1 expression. The inhibition of
      DSS-induced colitic pathology by caffeic acid was mediated by mechanisms in
      addition to anti-inflammatory effects that deserve further study.

PG  - 91-5
LID - 10.1007/s00508-008-1127-x [doi]
AB  - Clostridium difficile is mainly considered a nosocomial pathogen associated with 
      diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis in hospitalized patients. Austrian
      hospitals reported 2761 cases of C. difficile infection (including 277 lethal
      outcomes) in 2007, compared with 777 cases (including 54 lethal outcomes) in
      2003. The occurrence of community-acquired C. difficile infection is also
      increasingly reported. Recent studies have shown the occurrence of C. difficile
      in food and animals. The aim of the present study was to determine the occurrence
      of C. difficile in food and animals in Austria. Between March and July 2008, gut 
      or fecal samples from 67 cows, 61 pigs and 59 broiler chickens were collected at 
      Austrian abattoirs. Between February and April 2008 meat samples (51 beef [25
      ground], 27 pork [17 ground] and 6 samples of chicken meat) were purchased at
      retail outlets. Of the 187 samples tested, eight yielded C. difficile: in cows
      3/67 samples (4.5%) were positive, in pigs 2/61 (3.3%), in broiler chickens 3/59 
      (5%). Six of the eight isolates yielded toxigenic C. difficile (toxins A and B): 
      2/67 (3%) cow samples, 2/61 (3.3%) pig samples, 2/59 (3.4%) chicken samples.
      Genes for the binary toxin were detected in one of the two pig isolates, a PCR
      ribotype 126 strain. None of the 84 meat samples yielded C. difficile. The
      results of this Austrian study suggest that animal reservoirs are possible
      sources, via food, of human C. difficile infection.

AB  - Differences and similarities between Escherichia coli O157:H7 isolates from beef 
      cattle and those from sporadic human outbreaks are not fully elucidated. Here, we
      compared 44 O157:H7 isolates of bovine and human origins (22 isolates of each) to
      better understand their cytotoxic potential. The Shiga toxin genes stx1, stx2, or
      both were detected in the 44 isolates, and all elicited Vero cell cytotoxicity.
      The greatest cytotoxicity was caused by bovine isolates having only stx2 and
      which represented the majority of such isolates (81.8%). However, no correlation 
      was found between the level of stx gene transcription and cytotoxicity. All human
      and bovine isolates possessed variant type stx2 and stx2c, respectively, as
      determined by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Isolates harboring
      both stx1 and stx2 genes were much more frequent in human isolates (86.4%). The
      combination stx1-stx2c found in only four bovine isolates was less cytotoxic. It 
      is clear that cytotoxicity alone cannot account for the apparent inability of
      O157:H7 bovine isolates to cause diseases in humans. We have found that
      stx1-stx2-containing or stx1-stx2c-containing isolates were less cytotoxic than
      several bovine isolates having only stx2c, suggesting that the stx gene
      combination or other virulence genes in specific genetic lineages may affect the 
      disease outcome.

TI  - Allergic proctocolitis, food-induced enterocolitis: immune mechanisms, diagnosis 
      and treatment.
PG  - 36-42
AB  - The term food allergy refers to the immune reaction (mediated by IgE or
      otherwise) that develops in response to the ingestion of a concrete type of food.
      Among the different potential manifestations of an allergic reaction, those
      exclusively affecting the gastrointestinal system are described. In recent years,
      the study of non-IgE-mediated food allergy has grown in relevance. These
      disorders are almost always of a transient nature, inherent to (though not
      exclusive of) nursing infants, and with gastrointestinal symptoms that may have
      variable repercussions upon the nutritional state of the patient. The prevalence 
      of such reactions is not known, though some studies report that up to 60 % of all
      cases of allergy to cow's milk proteins (CMPs) are due to non-IgE-mediated
      mechanisms. The latency period between the time of ingestion and the appearance
      of the first clinical manifestations is greater than in the case of IgE-mediated 
      reactions, and the underlying immunopathological mechanism has not been clearly
      established although it is accepted that T cell mediation is involved. The
      gastrointestinal problems derived from these delayed or chronic reactions
      comprise allergic proctocolitis, enterocolitis and food protein enteropathies.
      These digestive disorders tend to appear in the first months of life, and are of 
      a progressive and generally self-limiting nature, with resolution at about two
      years of age. The most commonly implicated food is milk and, in our setting,
      there have also been reports implicating fish, egg and rice although such
      reactions can be triggered by any protein introduced into the infant diet. These 
      manifestations disappear after removing the causal protein from the diet. When
      the causal proteins are CMPs, a highly hydrolysed infant formula is supplied as
      substitute, and if the latter is not tolerated, an elemental amino acid-based
      formula is prescribed.

      investigation.
PG  - 1079-86
LID - 10.1086/597399 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli O157:H7 infection often causes hemorrhagic colitis
      and hemolytic uremic syndrome. METHODS: In 2006, the Wisconsin Division of Public
      Health and the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene, in cooperation with other
      local, state, and federal partners, investigated an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7
      infection. RESULTS: In September 2006, the Wisconsin Division of Public Health
      and the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene were able to link geographically
      dispersed E. coli O157:H7 isolates recovered from the stool samples of ill
      persons, all of which had the same pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern
      (i.e., outbreak pattern). Investigators conducted a case-control study with
      control subjects (n = 86) matched to case patients (n = 49) by age, sex, and
      residential location. All case patients' onsets of illness occurred during the
      period from 20 August through 14 September 2006. Illness was associated with
      spinach consumption (matched odds ratio, 82.1; 95% confidence interval, 14.7 to
      >1000). Of the 49 case patients, 26 (53%) recalled eating brand A spinach. On
      multibrand analysis, only brand A was associated with illness (undefined matched 
      odds ratio; 95% confidence interval, 6.8-infinity). Wisconsin's agriculture
      laboratory isolated E. coli O157:H7 with the outbreak pattern from spinach in 2
      brand A packages, both produced on 15 August 2006. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid
      multijurisdictional epidemiologic and laboratory response, including timely
      pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern analysis and PulseNet posting,
      facilitated prompt voluntary recall of brand A spinach.

TI  - Risk factors for low bone mass in patients with ulcerative colitis following
      ileal pouch-anal anastomosis.
PG  - 639-46
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2008.78 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Bone mineral density (BMD) can be adversely affected by the chronic
      nature of inflammatory bowel disease. Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is the 
      surgical treatment of choice for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) who
      require proctocolectomy. There are few data on BMD in UC patients with IPAA. The 
      aim of the study was to assess the prevalence and risk factors associated with
      low BMD in UC patients after IPAA. METHODS: A total of 327 eligible patients with
      UC and IPAA from the Pouchitis Clinic were enrolled. Dual-energy X-ray
      absorptiometry was performed. Patients were classified as having normal or low
      BMD, based on the criteria by the International Society for Clinical
      Densitometry. A total of 39 demographic and clinical variables were evaluated
      with logistic regression models. RESULTS: Of 327 patients with a median of 4
      years after IPAA, 105 (32.1%) had low BMD. Fragility fracture was documented in
      11 patients (10.5%) in the low BMD group and in 13 of 222 patients (5.9%) in the 
      normal BMD group (P=0.14). In the multivariable analysis, covariate-adjusted
      factors associated with a low BMD were advanced age (odds ratio (OR) =1.64 per 5 
      years; 95% CI, 1.44-1.87), low body mass index (OR=0.43 per 5 kg/m(2); 95% CI,
      0.30-0.62), and non-use of daily calcium supplement (OR=0.53; 95% CI, 0.29-0.96).
      Pouch-associated factors were not found to be significantly associated with the
      bone loss. CONCLUSIONS: Low BMD was common in patients with UC, even after
      colectomy and IPAA. Low BMD in this patient population was associated with
      certain risk factors, some of which may be modifiable.

TI  - Is there a future for probiotics in preventing Clostridium difficile-associated
      disease and treatment of recurrent episodes?
PG  - 15-32
LID - 10.1177/0884533608329232 [doi]
AB  - Due to morbidity, mortality, and high costs associated with eradicating
      Clostridium difficile once this organism causes colitis, this bacterium has been 
      termed one of the most ecologically relevant microorganisms of the present day.
      Symptoms associated with C. difficile diarrhea often first present during or
      shortly after a course of antibiotic therapy. During the past 5 years, the
      virulence of this organism has increased. C. difficile-associated disease (CDAD) 
      has reached epidemic proportions in some hospital settings, prompting Medicare to
      propose adding CDAD to the list of hospital-acquired conditions for which
      reimbursements may be cut. Thus, it is imperative that effective preventive
      strategies be implemented in hospitals to decrease CDAD infections. It is
      plausible that probiotic supplements may offer a safe and effective means of
      preventing both initial CDAD episodes as well as CDAD recurrences. This review
      critically examines the current literature in which probiotic supplements have
      been studied for efficacy in CDAD prevention. This analysis will guide
      practitioners in applying available probiotic data to CDAD clinical scenarios and
      will assist researchers in the appropriate design of future studies as
      examination continues into the role that probiotics may have in CDAD prevention.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial on the efficacy of synbiotic versus probiotic or
      prebiotic treatment to improve the quality of life in patients with ulcerative
      colitis.
PG  - 520-5
LID - 10.1016/j.nut.2008.11.017 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Studies suggest that synbiotic therapy could prove more effective in
      the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) than therapies limited to probiotics or 
      prebiotics. This study compared the effect of each of these therapies in the
      treatment of UC. METHODS: One hundred twenty outpatients with UC were randomly
      sorted into three groups of 40 patients each for probiotic, prebiotic, or
      synbiotic therapy. The probiotic group ingested one daily capsule consisting of
      Bifidobacterium longum 2 x 10(9) colony-forming units and the prebiotic group
      ingested daily 8.0-g doses of psyllium. The synbiotic group underwent both
      treatments. All patients completed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaires
      (IBDQs) at the onset of the trial, at the 2-wk midpoint, and at the 4-wk end of
      the trial. Blood variables were also evaluated in a subset of 32 patients
      randomly selected from all groups and values were compared with IBDQ scores.
      RESULTS: Thirty-one patients in the probiotic group, 31 in the prebiotic group,
      and 32 in the synbiotic group qualified for analyses. The remaining 26 patients
      had incomplete questionnaires. Total IBDQ scores improved within groups by the
      end of the trial (probiotics 162 to 169, NS; prebiotics 174 to 182, NS;
      synbiotics 168 to 176, P = 0.03). Individual scores improved as follows:
      probiotics, emotional function (P = 0.03); prebiotics, bowel function (P = 0.04);
      and synbiotics, systemic and social functions (P = 0.008 and P = 0.02).
      C-reactive protein decreased significantly only with synbiotic therapy (from 0.59
      to 0.14 mg/dL, P = 0.04). There were no adverse events. CONCLUSION: Patients with
      UC on synbiotic therapy experienced greater quality-of-life changes than patients
      on probiotic or prebiotic treatment. These data suggest that synbiotic therapy
      may have a synergistic effect in the treatment of UC.

TI  - Post-translational inhibition of IP-10 secretion in IEC by probiotic bacteria:
      impact on chronic inflammation.
PG  - e4365
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0004365 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical and experimental studies suggest that the probiotic mixture 
      VSL#3 has protective activities in the context of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD). The aim of the study was to reveal bacterial strain-specific molecular
      mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory potential of VSL#3 in intestinal
      epithelial cells (IEC). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: VSL#3 inhibited
      TNF-induced secretion of the T-cell chemokine interferon-inducible protein
      (IP-10) in Mode-K cells. Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) cell surface proteins
      were identified as active anti-inflammatory components of VSL#3. Interestingly,
      L. casei failed to block TNF-induced IP-10 promoter activity or IP-10 gene
      transcription at the mRNA expression level but completely inhibited IP-10 protein
      secretion as well as IP-10-mediated T-cell transmigration. Kinetic studies,
      pulse-chase experiments and the use of a pharmacological inhibitor for the export
      machinery (brefeldin A) showed that L. casei did not impair initial IP-10
      production but decreased intracellular IP-10 protein stability as a result of
      blocked IP-10 secretion. Although L. casei induced IP-10 ubiquitination, the
      inhibition of proteasomal or lysosomal degradation did not prevent the loss of
      intracellular IP-10. Most important for the mechanistic understanding, the
      inhibition of vesicular trafficking by 3-methyladenine (3-MA) inhibited IP-10 but
      not IL-6 expression, mimicking the inhibitory effects of L. casei. These findings
      suggest that L. casei impairs vesicular pathways important for the secretion of
      IP-10, followed by subsequent degradation of the proinflammatory chemokine.
      Feeding studies in TNF(DeltaARE) and IL-10(-/-) mice revealed a
      compartimentalized protection of VSL#3 on the development of cecal but not on
      ileal or colonic inflammation. Consistent with reduced tissue pathology in
      IL-10(-/-) mice, IP-10 protein expression was reduced in primary epithelial
      cells. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrate segment specific effects of
      probiotic intervention that correlate with reduced IP-10 protein expression in
      the native epithelium. Furthermore, we revealed post-translational degradation of
      IP-10 protein in IEC to be the molecular mechanism underlying the
      anti-inflammatory effect.

      disease.
PG  - 142-51
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181821964 [doi]
AB  - Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic inflammatory diseases of the
      intestinal tract commonly denoted as inflammatory bowel diseases. It has been
      proposed that these diseases result from aberrant mucosal immune responses to
      nonpathogenic microbial residents of the intestines. Recently, it was established
      that continuous interactions between the innate and the adaptive intestinal
      immune cells and the microbiota are directly involved in maintaining the
      physiological noninflammatory state of the intestinal mucosa. In light of the
      complexity of this mucosal homeostasis, it is astonishing that the inflammatory
      bowel diseases are relatively rare. Recently, altered functions of the innate
      immune system have been identified. As such, both hyperresponsiveness and
      hyporesponsiveness of innate cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of
      inflammatory bowel diseases.

TI  - Effect of a probiotic preparation (VSL#3) on induction and maintenance of
      remission in children with ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 437-43
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2008.118 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Several probiotic compounds have shown promise in the therapy of
      ulcerative colitis (UC). However, a strong sustained benefit remains to be seen. 
      Uncontrolled pilot studies suggest that a probiotic preparation (VSL#3) maintains
      remission in mild to moderate UC and reduces active inflammation in adult
      patients. Aims of our prospective, 1-year, placebo-controlled, double-blind study
      were to assess the efficacy of VSL#3 on induction and maintenance of remission
      and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the probiotic preparation therapy 
      in children with active UC. METHODS: A total of 29 consecutive patients (mean
      age: 9.8 years; range: 1.7-16.1 years; female/male: 13/16) with newly diagnosed
      UC were randomized to receive either VSL#3 (weight-based dose, range: 450-1,800
      billion bacteria/day; n=14) or an identical placebo (n=15) in conjunction with
      concomitant steroid induction and mesalamine maintenance treatment. Children were
      prospectively evaluated at four time points: within 1 month, 2 months, 6 months, 
      and 1 year after diagnosis or at the time of relapse. Lichtiger colitis activity 
      index and a physician's global assessment were used to measure disease activity. 
      At baseline, within 6 months and 12 months or at the time of relapse, all
      patients were assessed endoscopically and histologically. RESULTS: All 29
      patients responded to the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) induction therapy.
      Remission was achieved in 13 patients (92.8%) treated with VSL#3 and IBD therapy 
      and in 4 patients (36.4%) treated with placebo and IBD therapy (P<0.001).
      Overall, 3 of 14 (21.4%) patients treated with VSL#3 and IBD therapy and 11 of 15
      (73.3%) patients treated with placebo and IBD therapy relapsed within 1 year of
      follow-up (P=0.014; RR=0.32; CI=0.025-0.773; NNT=2). All 3 patients treated with 
      VSL#3 and 6 of 11 (54.5%) patients treated with placebo relapsed within 6 months 
      of diagnosis. At 6 months, 12 months, or at time of relapse, endoscopic and
      histological scores were significantly lower in the VSL#3 group than in the
      placebo group (P<0.05). There were no biochemical or clinical adverse events
      related to VSL#3. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first pediatric, randomized,
      placebo-controlled trial that suggests the efficacy and safety of a highly
      concentrated mixture of probiotic bacterial strains (VSL#3) in active UC and
      demonstrates its role in maintenance of remission.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study provides population-based estimates of recent medical
      conditions, concurrent developmental disorders, and health impact and utilization
      indicators for US children with and without Down syndrome. METHODS: The sample
      included children 3 to 17 years of age in the 1997-2005 National Health Interview
      Survey Child Sample Core and specifically included 146 children with Down
      syndrome, 604 children with mental retardation but without Down syndrome, and 95 
      454 children without either condition reported. Developmental and medical
      conditions, health status, and service use were reported by parents or other
      knowledgeable caregivers. RESULTS: After adjustment for demographic factors,
      children with Down syndrome had higher odds, compared with children without
      mental retardation, of recent food/digestive allergy, frequent diarrhea/colitis, 
      > or =3 ear infections in the previous year, very recent head/chest cold, and
      developmental disabilities other than mental retardation. They had increased odds
      that approached significance for recent seizures, very recent stomach/intestinal 
      illness, and asthma. They had substantially higher rates (threefold or higher,
      compared with children without mental retardation) for nearly all health impact
      and health and special education service use measures. Of note, >25% of children 
      with Down syndrome needed help with personal care, regularly took prescription
      medications, had recently seen a medical specialist, and received physical
      therapy or related therapy. The comparison group with mental retardation without 
      Down syndrome represented many children with multiple serious disabilities who
      also had high rates of medical conditions and high levels of health impact and
      service use. CONCLUSION: These findings provide empirical, population-based data 
      to inform guidelines for frequent monitoring and support for children with Down
      syndrome.

AB  - Probiotics are defined as live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate
      amounts, confer a health benefit on the host, including the gastrointestinal
      tract. While this beneficial effect was originally thought to stem from
      improvements in the intestinal microbial balance, there is now substantial
      evidence that probiotics can also provide benefits by modulating immune
      functions. In animal models, probiotic supplementation is able to provide
      protection from spontaneous and chemically induced colitis by downregulating
      inflammatory cytokines or inducing regulatory mechanisms in a strain-specific
      manner. In animal models of allergen sensitization and murine models of asthma
      and allergic rhinitis, orally administered probiotics can strain-dependently
      decrease allergen-specific IgE production, in part by modulating systemic
      cytokine production. Certain probiotics have been shown to decrease airway
      hyperresponsiveness and inflammation by inducing regulatory mechanisms. Promising
      results have been obtained with probiotics in the treatment of human inflammatory
      diseases of the intestine and in the prevention and treatment of atopic eczema in
      neonates and infants. However, the findings are too variable to allow firm
      conclusions as to the effectiveness of specific probiotics in these conditions.

TI  - The role of the high-affinity IgE receptor, FcepsilonRI, in eosinophilic
      gastrointestinal diseases.
PG  - 159-70, xii
LID - 10.1016/j.iac.2008.09.004 [doi]
AB  - Primary eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases (EGIDs) are a heterogeneous group 
      of diseases including eosinophilic esophagitis, eosinophilic gastritis,
      eosinophilic gastroenteritis, eosinophilic enteritis, and eosinophilic colitis.
      The unifying hallmark and diagnostic marker of EGIDs is an eosinophil-rich
      inflammatory infiltrate of the GI mucosa, in the absence of known causes for
      eosinophilia. The etiology of EGIDs is not yet fully understood. The pathogenesis
      however seems to involve a complex interplay of genetic predisposition, exposure 
      to food- and environmental allergens and IgE-mediated activation of the immune
      system. Accumulating evidence relates EGIDs to the group of T-helper (Th) 2
      mediated immune disorders, like IgE-mediated allergy. In this article we discuss 
      a possible role of IgE-mediated immune-activation via the high affinity receptor 
      for IgE, FcepsilonRI, in the pathogenesis of primary EGIDs. Beyond its defined
      role in type I allergic reactions, we here hypothesize that activation of
      tetrameric FcepsilonRI on mast cells and basophils as well as trimeric
      FcepsilonRI on human eosinophils and antigen presenting cells in the
      gastrointestinal mucosa is critically involved in the pathology of EGIDs. We also
      discuss how IgE-independent triggering of FcepsilonRI could be a mechanisms
      responsible for activation of the immune system in patients with EGID.

AB  - Eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases (EGIDs) encompass a variety of disorders
      including eosinophilic esophagitis (EE), eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EG), and
      eosinophilic colitis. Although the pathogenesis of EGIDs is still poorly
      understood, dietary food antigens have been shown to cause EGIDs through several 
      short-term clinical studies. The relationship of EGIDs with food allergy points
      to a potential breach of oral tolerance in EGIDs and to a potentially important
      role played by lymphocytes in responding to the oral food antigens. This article 
      discusses the concept of oral tolerance, the available evidence for the role that
      lymphocytes play in the induction and pathogenesis of EGIDs, and the evidence for
      a potential breach in oral tolerance in EGIDs.

AB  - This article focuses on the evaluation and management of eosinophilic
      gastrointestinal diseases other than eosinophilic esophagitis. Those diseases
      include eosinophilic gastritis, gastroenteritis, enteritis, and colitis. The
      diagnosis of eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease is primarily dependent on the 
      clinical history and histopathology of multiple biopsy specimens after ruling out
      other causes of intestinal eosinophilia. The diagnosis of eosinophilic
      gastrointestinal diseases other than eosinophilic esophagitis is complicated by
      the lack of uniformly accepted diagnostic criteria. Treatment involves evaluation
      for food sensitivity, elimination diets, and the use of anti-allergy and
      anti-inflammatory medications with varying degrees of success. Little is known
      about the natural history of eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases, underscoring
      the need for long-term follow-up studies of patients with these disorders.

LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2982.2008.01217.x [doi]
AB  - In this issue of Neurogastroenterology and Motility we find three new articles on
      different aspects of ghrelin, dealing with physiological and pathophysiological
      actions of the peptide. For the reader this is food for thoughts: Does this
      peptide do everything? Ghrelin is a gut peptide hormone well established to
      stimulate motility throughout most parts of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and
      appetite. Ghrelin has been linked to various GI regulatory mechanisms, the most
      evident being hunger, over-eating and obesity. In this setting ghrelin has been
      studied under physiological conditions converging on obesity as a
      pathophysiological process where the peptide has been employed as an interesting 
      tool for studying the development of obesity. With a widespread distribution of
      ghrelin receptors on various immune cells, it has been assumed that ghrelin also 
      possesses immunoregulatory properties, thus also being of interest in intestinal 
      inflammation research. Anti-inflammatory effects of exogenous ghrelin have been
      claimed in experimental colitis in mice. Further studies on this concept using
      ghrelin gene knock-out mice, however, show an increased inflammatory activity in 
      experimental colitis in wild-type mice pointing to ghrelin as an enhancer of the 
      inflammatory course of the disease. Taken together, recent studies on ghrelin
      indicate that the peptide is not only a regulatory agent in pathophysiological
      processes, but also participates in pathological disease conditions with actions 
      that seem to even involve genetic mechanisms.

TI  - Folate concentrations in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed inflammatory
      bowel disease.
PG  - 545-50
LID - 10.3945/ajcn.2008.26576 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Folate is postulated to protect against cell injury and long-term
      risk of cancer. Folate deficiency has been shown to be associated with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, folate concentrations are poorly
      delineated in children with IBD. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare folate
      concentrations between children with newly diagnosed IBD and healthy controls.
      DESIGN: Red blood cell folate (RBCF) and whole-blood folate (WBF) concentrations 
      were measured in 78 children (mean age: 12.8 +/- 2.7 y): 22 patients with newly
      diagnosed untreated Crohn disease, 11 patients with ulcerative colitis, 4
      patients with indeterminate colitis, and 41 controls. Vitamin supplementation and
      dietary intakes determined by food-frequency questionnaire were recorded for 20
      IBD patients and 28 controls. RESULTS: RBCF concentrations were 19.4% lower in
      controls (587.0 +/- 148.6 ng/mL) than in patients (728.7 +/- 185.8 ng/mL; P =
      0.0004), and WBF concentrations were 11.1% lower in controls (218.2 +/- 49.7
      ng/mL) than in patients (245.3 +/- 59.1 ng/mL; P = 0.031). Total folate intake
      was 18.8% higher in controls (444.7 +/- 266.7 microg/d) than in IBD patients
      (361.1 +/- 230.6 microg/d), but this difference was not statistically significant
      (P = 0.264). Folate intakes were below the Recommended Dietary Allowance (200-400
      microg/d), adjusted for age and sex, in 35.4% of study subjects. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      contrast with previous evidence of folate deficiency in adult IBD patients, our
      data indicate higher folate concentrations in children with newly diagnosed
      untreated IBD than in controls. This finding was unexpected, especially in light 
      of the higher dietary folate intakes and hematocrit values in children without
      IBD. The influence of IBD therapy on folate metabolism and the long-term clinical
      implications of high RBCF and WBF concentrations at the time of IBD diagnosis
      should be explored further.

AB  - This article presents a literature review of side effects of antihelikobakter
      therapy, as well as survey data, whose goal was to determine the efficacy and
      safety of normoflorins at patients after eradication therapy of peptic ulcer. It 
      was shown that the frequency of occurrence of side effects during
      antihelikobakter therapy varies widely and can reach, according to different
      authors, from 30 to 50% of patients. In addition to allergic and toxic PE, with
      antibacterial agents allocate their influence on the microflora of the colon,
      which often leads to development of a scarce and dysbacteriosis of
      antibioticassociated colitis. Appointment of biodiesel of normoflorin after
      eradication therapy effectively suppresses clinical signs of dyspepsia as a side 
      effect of antihelikobakter therapy enhances the effectiveness of treatment of
      patients and improve their quality of life.

TI  - Probiotics for inflammatory bowel disease: a critical appraisal.
PG  - 111-4
LID - 10.1159/000268130 [doi]
AB  - The notion that the intestinal microbiota plays a key role for the development of
      intestinal inflammation, initially based on a series of clinical observations
      both in human inflammatory bowel disease and experimental colitis, has been
      reinforced by a growing body of evidence demonstrating that the abnormal
      recognition of bacterial and other microbiota antigens by the innate immune
      system is one of the earliest events in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel
      disease. In keeping with our present knowledge of inflammatory bowel disease
      pathophysiology, the search for therapeutic approaches aimed at modifying the
      composition of the intestinal microbiota to obtain new, more targeted treatments 
      for inflammatory bowel disease that are basically free of side effects has been a
      subject of intense research activity. Probiotics are defined as live organisms
      capable of conferring health benefits beyond their nutritional properties.
      Numerous micro-organisms have been evaluated to induce or maintain remission, or 
      both, in ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and pouchitis. Overall, probiotics
      have successfully demonstrated some efficacy in some inflammatory bowel disease
      scenarios. However, a critical review of the available scientific literature
      shows that: (1) in spite of great expectations, reflected by a high number of
      review and editorial articles in top journals, the number of published,
      well-designed clinical trials using probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease is
      small, often with few patients; (2) the range of microbial agents makes it
      particularly difficult to draw global conclusions; (3) the quality of the
      evidence on the efficacy of probiotics in pouchitis is clearly better than that
      in ulcerative colitis, while there is virtually no evidence of probiotic efficacy
      in Crohn's disease. The appropriate selection of probiotic agents combined with
      convincing clinical trials will determine whether probiotics can jump from
      promise to reality in inflammatory bowel disease clinical practice.

AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are the two principal forms of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Animal studies show that bacteria are involved 
      in the etiology of IBD, and much is now known about the inflammatory processes
      associated with CD and UC, as well as the underlying genetic, environmental, and 
      lifestyle issues that can affect an individual's predisposition to these
      diseases. However, while a number of candidate microorganisms have been put
      forward as causative factors in IBD, the primary etiologic agents are unknown.
      This review discusses the potential role of luminal and mucosal microbial
      communities in the etiology of IBD, and outlines studies that have been made
      using a variety of biotherapeutic therapies, involving the use of antibiotics,
      probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics.

TI  - Interventions for treating microscopic colitis: a Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel

PG  - 235-41; quiz 234, 242
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2008.16 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To conduct a systematic review to determine effective treatments for 
      patients with collagenous colitis or lymphocytic colitis, the two subtypes of
      microscopic colitis. METHODS: Relevant papers were identified via the MEDLINE,
      PUBMED, and Cochrane Collaboration databases, manual searches of the references
      of identified papers and review papers on microscopic colitis, as well as
      searches of abstracts from major gastroenterological meetings. RESULTS: All
      studies assessing treatment of microscopic colitis had relatively small sample
      sizes. A total of 10 randomized trials included patients with collagenous
      colitis. Budesonide was studied for induction of response in three trials and for
      maintenance of response in two trials. The pooled odds ratio for inducing
      clinical response with budesonide was 12.32 (95% confidence interval, CI
      5.53-27.46), and for maintaining clinical response was 8.82 (95% CI 3.19-24.37), 
      with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 2 patients for each outcome. Budesonide
      also induced and maintained histological response and was well tolerated. Bismuth
      subsalicylate, prednisolone, and mesalamine with or without cholestyramine may be
      effective, whereas Boswellia serrata extract and probiotics were ineffective for 
      treating collagenous colitis. Three randomized trials included patients with
      lymphocytic colitis. Budesonide was shown in one study to be effective for
      inducing clinical response (OR 9.00; 95% CI 1.98-40.93), with an NNT of three
      patients. Budesonide also induced histological response and was well tolerated.
      Bismuth subsalicylate and mesalamine with or without cholestyramine may be
      effective for treating lymphocytic colitis. No trials assessed maintenance of
      response in patients with lymphocytic colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Budesonide is
      effective and well tolerated for inducing and maintaining clinical and
      histological responses in patients with collagenous colitis, and for inducing
      clinical and histological responses in patients with lymphocytic colitis.
      Determining the magnitude of benefit is limited by the small sample sizes of the 
      studies. The evidence for other agents, including bismuth subsalicylate,
      prednisolone, B. serrata extract, probiotics, and mesalamine with or without
      cholestyramine is weaker. It is not clear that any of these agents induce or
      maintain actual remission of collagenous or lymphocytic colitis, as opposed to
      clinical or histological response.

      trans-cinnamaldehyde.
PG  - 146-9
LID - 10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2008.11.016 [doi]
AB  - Enterobacter sakazakii is an emerging pathogen which causes a life-threatening
      form of meningitis, necrotizing colitis and meningoencephalitis in neonates and
      children. Epidemiological studies implicate dried infant formula as the principal
      source of the pathogen. Trans-cinnamaldehyde is a major component of bark extract
      of cinnamon. It is classified as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the U.S. 
      Food and Drug Administration, and is approved for use in food (21 CFR 182.60).
      The objective of this study was to determine the antibacterial effect of
      trans-cinnamaldehyde on E. sakazakii in reconstituted infant formula. A 5-strain 
      mixture of E. sakazakii was inoculated into 10 ml samples of reconstituted infant
      formula (at 6.0 log CFU/ml) containing 0%, 0.15%, 0.3% or 0.5%
      trans-cinnamaldehyde. The samples were incubated at 37, 23, 8 or 4 degrees C for 
      0, 6, 10 and 24 h, and the surviving populations of E. sakazakii at each sampling
      time were enumerated. In addition, potential cytotoxicity of
      trans-cinnamaldehyde, if any, was determined on human embryonic intestinal cells 
      (INT-407). The treatments containing trans-cinnamaldehyde significantly reduced
      (P<0.05) the population of E. sakazakii, compared to the controls.
      Trans-cinnamaldehyde (0.5%) reduced the pathogen to undetectable levels by 4 h of
      incubation at 37 or 23 degrees C and 10 h of incubation at 8 or 4 degrees C,
      respectively. Trans-cinnamaldehyde produced no cytotoxic effects on human
      embryonic intestinal cells at the tested concentrations. Results indicate that
      trans-cinnamaldehyde could potentially be used to kill E. sakazakii in
      reconstituted infant formula, however sensory studies are warranted before
      recommending its use.

TI  - Probiotic preparation VSL#3 induces remission in children with mild to moderate
      acute ulcerative colitis: a pilot study.
PG  - 760-8
LID - 10.1002/ibd.20816 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      that has periods of exacerbated symptoms and periods that are symptom-free. The
      treatment of active UC with probiotic bacteria could possibly induce remission.
      We evaluated the clinical efficacy and safety profile of probiotic preparation
      VSL#3 in the treatment of mild to moderate acute UC in the pediatric population. 
      METHODS: Eighteen eligible patients between the ages of 3-17 with mild to
      moderate acute UC received open-label VSL#3 daily in 2 divided doses for 8 weeks.
      The disease activity pre- and post-VSL#3 therapy was assessed by the simple
      clinical colitis activity index (SCCAI); Mayo ulcerative colitis endoscopic
      score; inflammatory markers: erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive 
      protein (CRP); serum cytokine profiling; and rectal tissue microbial profiling
      done at baseline and at week 8. RESULTS: Thirteen patients completed 8 weeks of
      VSL#3 treatment and 5 patients were withdrawn due to lack of improvement.
      Remission (defined as SCCAI <or=3) was achieved in 56% of children (n = 10);
      response (decrease in SCCAI >or=2, but final score <or=5) in 6% (n = 1); and no
      change or worsening in 39% (n = 7). Post-VSL#3 treatments demonstrated a
      bacterial taxonomy change in rectal biopsy. The VSL#3 was well tolerated in
      clinical trials and no biochemical and clinical adverse effects attributed to
      VSL#3 were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of pediatric patients diagnosed
      with mild to moderate UC with VSL#3 resulted in a remission rate of 56% and a
      combined remission/response rate of 61%.

TI  - Human microbiota-secreted factors inhibit shiga toxin synthesis by
      enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.
PG  - 783-90
LID - 10.1128/IAI.01048-08 [doi]
AB  - Escherichia coli O157:H7 is a food-borne pathogen causing hemorrhagic colitis and
      hemolytic-uremic syndrome, especially in children. The main virulence factor
      responsible for the more serious disease is the Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2), which is
      released in the gut after oral ingestion of the organism. Although it is accepted
      that the amount of Stx2 produced by E. coli O157:H7 in the gut is critical for
      the development of disease, the eukaryotic or prokaryotic gut factors that
      modulate Stx2 synthesis are largely unknown. In this study, we examined the
      influence of prokaryotic molecules released by a complex human microbiota on Stx2
      synthesis by E. coli O157:H7. Stx2 synthesis was assessed after growth of E. coli
      O157:H7 in cecal contents of gnotobiotic rats colonized with human microbiota or 
      in conditioned medium having supported the growth of complex human microbiota.
      Extracellular prokaryotic molecules produced by the commensal microbiota repress 
      stx(2) mRNA expression and Stx2 production by inhibiting the spontaneous and
      induced lytic cycle mediated by RecA. These molecules, with a molecular mass of
      below 3 kDa, are produced in part by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a predominant 
      species of the normal human intestinal microbiota. The microbiota-induced stx(2) 
      repression is independent of the known quorum-sensing pathways described in E.
      coli O157:H7 involving SdiA, QseA, QseC, or autoinducer 3. Our findings
      demonstrate for the first time the regulatory activity of a soluble factor
      produced by the complex human digestive microbiota on a bacterial virulence
      factor in a physiologically relevant context.

TI  - Transforming growth factor-beta activity in commercially available pasteurized
      cow milk provides protection against inflammation in mice.
PG  - 69-75
LID - 10.3945/jn.108.092528 [doi]
AB  - Cow milk contains a large amount of an immunoregulatory cytokine, transforming
      growth factor-beta (TGFbeta). The present study investigated whether commercially
      available pasteurized cow milk retains TGFbeta activity both in vitro and in
      vivo. Some commercial cow milk increased TGFbeta/Smad-responsive reporter
      activity and induced Smad2 phosphorylation and the transcription of the
      TGFbeta/Smad target genes TGFbeta itself and Smad7 in vitro. Mice treated orally 
      with 500 microL of cow milk containing TGFbeta (3 microg/L) daily for 2 wk had
      increased phosphorylation of Smad2 and TGFbeta and Smad7 mRNA expression in the
      intestine. These mice also had significantly greater serum TGFbeta concentrations
      than the mice treated orally with PBS. Furthermore, oral administration of 500
      microL of cow milk containing TGFbeta (3 microg/L) daily for 2 wk before the
      induction of dextran sodium sulfate colitis and lipopolysaccharide-induced
      endotoxemia ameliorated tissue damage and mortality, respectively, in mice. These
      in vivo effects of cow milk were abrogated by the simultaneous administration of 
      TGFbeta type I receptor kinase inhibitor with the cow milk, and they were not
      observed after the oral administration of cow's milk containing little TGFbeta.
      In humans, 1 oral challenge of 10 mL/kg cow milk containing TGFbeta (3 microg/L) 
      increased the plasma TGFbeta concentrations at 4 h after the challenge. Thus,
      some commercially available pasteurized cow milk retains TGFbeta activity, which 
      may be able to provide protection against experimental colitis and endotoxemia
      associated with increased intestinal and circulating TGFbeta levels.

TI  - Pouchitis, similar to active ulcerative colitis, is associated with impaired
      butyrate oxidation by intestinal mucosa.
PG  - 335-40
LID - 10.1002/ibd.20768 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Healthy colonic mucosa uses butyrate as the major energy source. In
      ulcerative colitis (UC) butyrate oxidation has been shown to be disturbed, but it
      remains unclear whether this is a primary defect. The aim of this study was to
      measure mucosal butyrate oxidation in UC (involved and noninvolved colon) and in 
      pouchitis and to study the relationship with endoscopic as well as histological
      disease activity. METHODS: Butyrate oxidation was measured in 73 UC patients, 22 
      pouchitis patients, and 112 controls (95 colon, 17 ileum) by incubating biopsies 
      with 1 mM 14C-labeled Na-butyrate and measuring the released 14CO2. RESULTS:
      Compared with that in normal colon, butyrate oxidation was significantly impaired
      in endoscopically active but not in quiescent disease or uninvolved colon
      segments. The severity of the metabolic defect was related to histological
      disease activity and decreased epithelial cell height. In active pouchitis,
      butyrate oxidation was significantly decreased compared with that in normal ileum
      and excluded pouches without inflammation. The histological pouchitis score
      correlated significantly with butyrate oxidation. CONCLUSIONS: Active UC and
      pouchitis show the same inflammation-related metabolic defect. Our data suggest
      that the defect is a consequence of inflammation and that pouchitis is
      metabolically similar to active UC.

TI  - Prebiotics in chronic intestinal inflammation.
PG  - 454-62
LID - 10.1002/ibd.20737 [doi]
AB  - Prebiotics are nondigestible fermentable fibers that are reported to have health 
      benefits for the host. Older as well as more recent studies show beneficial
      effects in experimental colitis and lately also in human inflammatory bowel
      diseases (IBD), such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and chronic
      pouchitis. In this review we give an overview of the benefits of prebiotics in
      rodent IBD models and in IBD patients and discuss their possible protective
      mechanisms. Commensal intestinal bacteria induce and perpetuate chronic
      intestinal inflammation, whereas others are protective. However, most of the
      current medications are directed against the exaggerated proinflammatory immune
      response of the host, some of them toxic and costly. Feeding prebiotics changes
      the composition of the intestinal microflora toward more protective intestinal
      bacteria and alters systemic and mucosal immune responses of the host. Therapy
      for IBD targeting intestinal bacteria and their function is just emerging.
      Prebiotics have the promise to be relatively safe, inexpensive, and easy to
      administer. Unraveling their protective mechanisms will help to develop rational 
      applications of prebiotics. However, the initial promising results with dietary
      prebiotics in preclinical trials as well as small studies in human IBD will need 
      to be confirmed in large randomized controlled clinical trials.

TI  - High prevalence of vitamin K and D deficiency and decreased BMD in inflammatory
      bowel disease.
PG  - 935-42
LID - 10.1007/s00198-008-0764-2 [doi]
AB  - SUMMARY: Vitamin K and D deficiency and decreased bone mineral density (BMD) were
      highly prevalent in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially
      Crohn's disease (CD). Dietary intakes of these vitamins, however, were above the 
      Japanese adequate intakes in IBD patients, suggesting that malabsorption is the
      basis for hypovitaminosis K and D and decreased BMD. INTRODUCTION: We have
      studied the possible involvement of vitamin K and D deficiency in the
      pathogenesis of decreased BMD in IBD. METHODS: Seventy patients with IBD were
      evaluated for their BMD; plasma levels of vitamin K; phylloquinone (PK),
      menaquinone-7 (MK-7), and 25OH-D; serum PTH, protein induced by vitamin K absence
      (PIVKA-II), and undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) levels; and their food
      intake. RESULTS: Compared with ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, CD patients had 
      significantly lower plasma vitamin K and 25OH-D concentrations; significantly
      higher serum levels of PTH, PIVKA-II, and ucOC; and significantly lower BMD
      scores at almost all measurement sites. More IBD patients were vitamin K
      deficient in bone than in liver. Multiple regression analyses revealed that low
      plasma concentrations of vitamin K and 25OH-D were independent risk factors for
      low BMD and that they were associated with the patients' fat intake, but not with
      their intake of these vitamins. CONCLUSION: IBD patients have high prevalence of 
      decreased BMD and vitamin K and D deficiency probably caused by malabsorption of 
      these vitamins.

AB  - The goal was to use temporal gastrointestinal transit simulations and formulation
      to predict and provide sustained input of target-site directed oral drug delivery
      exclusively into the colon. Using mesalamine as the model drug for formulation
      coupled with stomach emptying rates (fed and unfed) plus intestinal transit times
      demonstrates concepts and provides a specific example for treatment in ulcerative
      colitis. Formulation involved extrusion and spheronization into beads which were 
      then coated with aqueous Eudragit S. Drug is released only at colonic pH and
      gastrointestinal transit predicts sustained drug input into the colon, especially
      when food effects are included.

TI  - A meta-analysis of the efficacy of sulfasalazine in comparison with
      5-aminosalicylates in the induction of improvement and maintenance of remission
      in patients with ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1157-70
LID - 10.1007/s10620-008-0481-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Historically, sulfasalazine (SSZ) and 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASAs)
      have been a mainstay of mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis (UC) remission
      induction and maintenance therapy. Considering the pivotal role of intestinal
      microbial flora in pathophysiology of UC and antimicrobial activity of
      sulfapyridine, we hypothesized that SSZ might be more effective than 5-ASAs in
      the management of UC. AIM: To compare the efficacy and tolerability of SSZ with
      each of the 5-ASAs (mesalamine, olsalazine, and balsalazide) by a meta-analysis
      technique. METHODS: Pubmed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central 
      Register of Controlled Trials were searched for studies compared efficacy and/or 
      tolerability of SSZ with 5-ASAs in the management of UC. The search terms were:
      "sulfasalazine" or "sulfasalazine" and "5-aminosalicylic acid," "mesalazine,"
      "mesalamine," "olsalazine" or "balsalazide" and "ulcerative colitis." Data were
      collected from 1966 to April 2008. There was no language restriction. "Overall
      improvement," "relapse rate," "total adverse events," and "withdrawals because of
      adverse events" were the key outcomes of interest. RESULTS: Twenty randomized
      placebo controlled trials met our criteria and were included in the
      meta-analysis. Comparison of SSZ with mesalamine yielded a nonsignificant
      relative risk (RR) of 1.04 (95% confidence interval of 0.89-1.21, P = 0.63) for
      overall improvement, a nonsignificant RR of 0.98 (95% CI 0.78-1.23, P = 0.85) for
      relapse, a nonsignificant RR of 0.76 (95% CI 0.54-1.07, P = 0.11) for any adverse
      events, and a nonsignificant RR of 0.78 (95% CI 0.46-1.3, P = 0.33) for
      withdrawals due to adverse events. Comparison of SSZ with olsalazine yielded a
      nonsignificant RR of 1.14 (95% CI 0.91-1.43, P = 0.25) for overall improvement, a
      nonsignificant RR of 0.93 (95% CI 0.77-1.12, P = 0.42) for relapse, a
      nonsignificant RR of 1.21 (95% CI 0.9-1.61, P = 0.20) for any adverse events, and
      a nonsignificant RR of 1.53 (95% CI 0.93-2.52, P = 0.09) for withdrawals due to
      adverse events. Comparison of SSZ with balsalazide yielded a nonsignificant RR of
      1.3 (95% CI 0.93-1.81, P = 0.12) for overall improvement, and a significant RR of
      0.17 (95% CI 0.06-0.49, P = 0.001) for withdrawals because of adverse events.
      CONCLUSION: SSZ does not differ from mesalamine or olsalazine in terms of
      efficacy and tolerability in UC. Withdrawal from study due to adverse events was 
      significantly lower for balsalazide compared with SSZ. Convincing conclusions on 
      the comparison of effectiveness and safety of balsalazide and SSZ in UC remains
      to be elucidated by further clinical trials. Considering the lower cost of
      treatment with SSZ and the equal rate of adverse events with other 5-ASAa, it is 
      not surprising to suggest SSZ as a first-choice treatment for UC and reserve
      5-ASAs for when SSZ intolerability occurs.

AB  - Difficulty intubation is the most common long-term complication after continent
      ileostomy, which can be associated with nipple valve slippage, parastomal hernia,
      stenosis. Diagnosis and management of a patient with nipple valve stricture and
      partial bowel obstruction associated with dietary supplement retention in the
      pouch reservoir is described. A 50-year-old female patient with ulcerative
      colitis and a 15-year history of continent ileostomy after total proctocolectomy 
      reported 5-week symptoms of abdominal pain and difficulty in intubating the
      pouch. Pill bezoar composed of dietary supplement was found in diagnostic pouch
      endoscopy. Therapeutic pouch endoscopy was performed with balloon dilation of a
      nipple valve stenosis and retrieval of 224 dietary supplement tablets. Pill
      bezoar in the pouch is rare. However, patients with continent ileostomy should be
      advised to avoid taking hard-to-dissolve foods and medications.

TI  - Peripheral cytokine profile in Chilean patients with Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 33-8
LID - 10.1684/ecn.2009.0142 [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) belong to the group of
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), with complex ethiopathogenic factors that
      include an unbalanced immune and inflammatory response to commensal and food
      antigens. The differential diagnosis between CD and UC is performed using
      clinical, endoscopic, histopathological, serological and radiological methods;
      however between 10-15% of IBD patients are diagnosed as "unclassified colitis".
      Further research into IBD is necessary in order to develop additional diagnostic 
      tools. The aim of this work was to see if the Th1, Th17 or Th2 immune pattern,
      represented by CD4+ lymphocytes producing IFN-gamma, IL-17 and IL-5 or IL-13,
      respectively (CD4/IFN-gamma+, CD4/IL-17+,CD4/IL-5+ or, CD4/IL13+), are useful
      peripheral markers which can be used to differentiate between UC and CD.
      Peripheral blood samples were taken from IBD patients from the Clinic Hospital of
      the University of Chile. The percentage of IFN-gamma-, IL-17-, IL-5- or
      IL-13-expressing CD4+ cells was determined by flow cytometry in phorbol ester-
      (PMA) and calcymycin-activated blood samples. The percentages of the CD4+ cell
      populations producing each cytokine were compared between UC and CD. IFN-gamma
      production by CD4+ lymphocytes was significantly higher in CD compared to UC and 
      the control. The percentage of IL-17-expressing cells was significantly higher in
      CD patients compared to to the control; however, there were no differences
      between UC and CD; or between UC and healthy individuals. No significant
      differences were observed between the different groups as regards the
      representative Th2 cytokines. This study suggests that, under pathogenic
      conditions, several immune profiles may be operating, in the development of IBD. 
      Although peripheral IFN-gamma and IL-17 expression, as indicators of the immune
      pattern, may help in the diagnosis of IBD, other cytokines and adaptive immune
      markers should be analyzed to allow better differentiation between the two
      entities.
