AB  - The pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) is not fully
      understood. The interaction between intestinal environmental factors of food and 
      intestinal microbes and the immunological system of hosts seems to be an
      important aspect. We have reviewed the relationship of the daily consumption of
      dietary animal meat and fats, dairy products, sugar, and other factors that may
      be linked to the occurrence of CD and UC from the literature and Japanese
      epidemiological data. In the present study, we reviewed the association between
      food and intestinal microbes and other factors contributing to the occurence of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) from epidemiological data and case-control
      studies of IBD in the literature that appeared on Medline, and assessed the
      reports of intestinal microbes involved in the occurrence of IBD. We found
      several papers describing the positive association of animal meat and sweets and 
      sugar with the occurrence of CD and UC. An analysis of Japanese epidemiological
      data suggested that the registered number of patients with CD or UC started to
      increase more than 20 years after an increased daily consumption of dietary
      animal meat and fats, and milk and dairy products, and after a decreased
      consumption of rice. Many studies implied a positive role of intestinal microbes 
      in the occurrence of IBD. Intestinal environmental factors, such as Westernized
      food and intestinal microbes, seem to be involved in the increased occurrence of 
      IBD.

TI  - Folate concentrations in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed inflammatory
      bowel disease.
PG  - 545-50
LID - 10.3945/ajcn.2008.26576 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Folate is postulated to protect against cell injury and long-term
      risk of cancer. Folate deficiency has been shown to be associated with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, folate concentrations are poorly
      delineated in children with IBD. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare folate
      concentrations between children with newly diagnosed IBD and healthy controls.
      DESIGN: Red blood cell folate (RBCF) and whole-blood folate (WBF) concentrations 
      were measured in 78 children (mean age: 12.8 +/- 2.7 y): 22 patients with newly
      diagnosed untreated Crohn disease, 11 patients with ulcerative colitis, 4
      patients with indeterminate colitis, and 41 controls. Vitamin supplementation and
      dietary intakes determined by food-frequency questionnaire were recorded for 20
      IBD patients and 28 controls. RESULTS: RBCF concentrations were 19.4% lower in
      controls (587.0 +/- 148.6 ng/mL) than in patients (728.7 +/- 185.8 ng/mL; P =
      0.0004), and WBF concentrations were 11.1% lower in controls (218.2 +/- 49.7
      ng/mL) than in patients (245.3 +/- 59.1 ng/mL; P = 0.031). Total folate intake
      was 18.8% higher in controls (444.7 +/- 266.7 microg/d) than in IBD patients
      (361.1 +/- 230.6 microg/d), but this difference was not statistically significant
      (P = 0.264). Folate intakes were below the Recommended Dietary Allowance (200-400
      microg/d), adjusted for age and sex, in 35.4% of study subjects. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      contrast with previous evidence of folate deficiency in adult IBD patients, our
      data indicate higher folate concentrations in children with newly diagnosed
      untreated IBD than in controls. This finding was unexpected, especially in light 
      of the higher dietary folate intakes and hematocrit values in children without
      IBD. The influence of IBD therapy on folate metabolism and the long-term clinical
      implications of high RBCF and WBF concentrations at the time of IBD diagnosis
      should be explored further.

PG  - S47-9
LID - 10.1038/mi.2008.52 [doi]
AB  - Immune homeostasis at mucosal level results from controlled response to
      intestinal luminal antigens. Recent insights into the nature of inflammatory
      bowel diseases, derived mainly from studies of experimental models of colonic
      inflammation, strongly suggest that they can result from a loss of immune
      tolerance to antigens in the bacterial microflora. Investigations of the
      regulatory mechanisms operating at the mucosal level suggest that regulatory
      cells reactive to the intestinal microflora might play a role in cross-reactive
      protection toward different antigens. Expansion of microflora-reactive regulatory
      cells by probiotic administration is able to protect from experimental colitis.
      Characterization of regulatory cells in response to normal commensal flora, the
      basis of their development and the role of innate immunity in this process might 
      contribute to the understanding of the development of inflammatory bowel
      diseases.

TI  - Inactivation of Enterobacter sakazakii in reconstituted infant formula by
      trans-cinnamaldehyde.
PG  - 146-9
LID - 10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2008.11.016 [doi]
AB  - Enterobacter sakazakii is an emerging pathogen which causes a life-threatening
      form of meningitis, necrotizing colitis and meningoencephalitis in neonates and
      children. Epidemiological studies implicate dried infant formula as the principal
      source of the pathogen. Trans-cinnamaldehyde is a major component of bark extract
      of cinnamon. It is classified as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the U.S. 
      Food and Drug Administration, and is approved for use in food (21 CFR 182.60).
      The objective of this study was to determine the antibacterial effect of
      trans-cinnamaldehyde on E. sakazakii in reconstituted infant formula. A 5-strain 
      mixture of E. sakazakii was inoculated into 10 ml samples of reconstituted infant
      formula (at 6.0 log CFU/ml) containing 0%, 0.15%, 0.3% or 0.5%
      trans-cinnamaldehyde. The samples were incubated at 37, 23, 8 or 4 degrees C for 
      0, 6, 10 and 24 h, and the surviving populations of E. sakazakii at each sampling
      time were enumerated. In addition, potential cytotoxicity of
      trans-cinnamaldehyde, if any, was determined on human embryonic intestinal cells 
      (INT-407). The treatments containing trans-cinnamaldehyde significantly reduced
      (P<0.05) the population of E. sakazakii, compared to the controls.
      Trans-cinnamaldehyde (0.5%) reduced the pathogen to undetectable levels by 4 h of
      incubation at 37 or 23 degrees C and 10 h of incubation at 8 or 4 degrees C,
      respectively. Trans-cinnamaldehyde produced no cytotoxic effects on human
      embryonic intestinal cells at the tested concentrations. Results indicate that
      trans-cinnamaldehyde could potentially be used to kill E. sakazakii in
      reconstituted infant formula, however sensory studies are warranted before
      recommending its use.

LID - 10.1016/j.nutres.2008.02.005 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn
      disease (CD), is a disorder characterized by diffuse inflammation of the
      gastrointestinal tract. The immune response and inflammation are mediated by
      polyunsaturated fatty acids and influenced by dietary fats and lipid metabolism. 
      This study examined the qualitative and quantitative fat intake of IBD patients
      and healthy controls on plasma phospholipid and erythrocyte membrane phospholipid
      (EMP) fatty acid content. Measurement of the fatty acid composition of plasma
      phospholipid and EMP were performed in 29 UC patients, 20 CD patients, and 31
      healthy controls. Anthropometric characteristics and data on dietary intake were 
      also collected. We observed significantly lower lipid intake in UC and CD
      patients vs controls. The UC and CD patients had significantly higher levels of
      linoleic acid in their EMP than did controls. There were no significant
      differences in the levels of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, but there were
      significantly higher levels of the n-6 in the EMP of UC and CD patients compared 
      with controls. The significant differences persisted after the data were adjusted
      for potential confounders and lipid intake. Higher levels of linoleic acids and
      n-6 fatty acids, which are involved in production of proinflammatory mediators,
      were found in IBD patients compared with controls, thereby implicating n-6 fatty 
      acids in the pathophysiology of the disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to determine gender-related and city- and
      countryside-related differences of ulcerative colitis in a Chinese population,
      and to determine information on the role of lifestyle in the onset of ulcerative 
      colitis. METHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis established
      between Jan 2000 and Dec 2007 were investigated according to the age, gender and 
      inductive factors of onset. Assessment of living condition of the patients was
      performed according to the place of living: city or countryside. Statistical
      analysis was performed using the chi-square test. RESULTS: A total of 293
      ulcerative colitis patients were involved in the study. The onset age of the
      rural patients was earlier than that of the urban patients (p=0.00295), while
      there was no difference in onset age between male and female patients
      (p=0.067995). Some inductive factors, such as psychological stress, fatigue, cold
      catching, and spicy or unwashed food, may contribute to the progress of
      ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSION: Both gender-related and city- and
      countryside-related differences were found in the expression of ulcerative
      colitis in the Chinese population. Lifestyle factors such as psychological stress
      and fatigue may contribute to the expression of ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Rationale for probiotic treatment strategies in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 337-55
LID - 10.1586/17474124.2.3.337 [doi]
AB  - Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis, are recurrent and aggressive inflammatory disorders that are most likely
      the result of an overly aggressive immune response to ubiquitous intestinal
      antigens in a genetically susceptible host. Despite decades of intense research, 
      our knowledge of factors causing IBD remains incomplete and, therefore,
      conventional therapy to induce and maintain remission works in a symptomatic
      fashion, merely suppressing the immune response. Probiotic bacteria have long
      been known to confer health benefits, especially with regard to intestinal
      disorders. Although there is mounting evidence from in vitro and animal
      experiments supporting the use of probiotics in IBD, clinical trials have not
      provided definite evidence for the therapeutic effect of probiotic therapy in IBD
      to date. This is with the notable exception of pouchitis and the maintenance of
      remission in ulcerative colitis, whereas Crohn's disease and active ulcerative
      colitis do not seem amenable to probiotic intervention. The next 5 years will see
      more trials targeting specific clinical settings using tailor-made probiotic
      combinations, taking into account our increasing knowledge of individual
      probiotic properties and the diversity of these microorganisms.

TI  - Human microbiota-secreted factors inhibit shiga toxin synthesis by
      enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.
PG  - 783-90
LID - 10.1128/IAI.01048-08 [doi]
AB  - Escherichia coli O157:H7 is a food-borne pathogen causing hemorrhagic colitis and
      hemolytic-uremic syndrome, especially in children. The main virulence factor
      responsible for the more serious disease is the Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2), which is
      released in the gut after oral ingestion of the organism. Although it is accepted
      that the amount of Stx2 produced by E. coli O157:H7 in the gut is critical for
      the development of disease, the eukaryotic or prokaryotic gut factors that
      modulate Stx2 synthesis are largely unknown. In this study, we examined the
      influence of prokaryotic molecules released by a complex human microbiota on Stx2
      synthesis by E. coli O157:H7. Stx2 synthesis was assessed after growth of E. coli
      O157:H7 in cecal contents of gnotobiotic rats colonized with human microbiota or 
      in conditioned medium having supported the growth of complex human microbiota.
      Extracellular prokaryotic molecules produced by the commensal microbiota repress 
      stx(2) mRNA expression and Stx2 production by inhibiting the spontaneous and
      induced lytic cycle mediated by RecA. These molecules, with a molecular mass of
      below 3 kDa, are produced in part by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a predominant 
      species of the normal human intestinal microbiota. The microbiota-induced stx(2) 
      repression is independent of the known quorum-sensing pathways described in E.
      coli O157:H7 involving SdiA, QseA, QseC, or autoinducer 3. Our findings
      demonstrate for the first time the regulatory activity of a soluble factor
      produced by the complex human digestive microbiota on a bacterial virulence
      factor in a physiologically relevant context.

TI  - Transforming growth factor-beta activity in commercially available pasteurized
      cow milk provides protection against inflammation in mice.
PG  - 69-75
LID - 10.3945/jn.108.092528 [doi]
AB  - Cow milk contains a large amount of an immunoregulatory cytokine, transforming
      growth factor-beta (TGFbeta). The present study investigated whether commercially
      available pasteurized cow milk retains TGFbeta activity both in vitro and in
      vivo. Some commercial cow milk increased TGFbeta/Smad-responsive reporter
      activity and induced Smad2 phosphorylation and the transcription of the
      TGFbeta/Smad target genes TGFbeta itself and Smad7 in vitro. Mice treated orally 
      with 500 microL of cow milk containing TGFbeta (3 microg/L) daily for 2 wk had
      increased phosphorylation of Smad2 and TGFbeta and Smad7 mRNA expression in the
      intestine. These mice also had significantly greater serum TGFbeta concentrations
      than the mice treated orally with PBS. Furthermore, oral administration of 500
      microL of cow milk containing TGFbeta (3 microg/L) daily for 2 wk before the
      induction of dextran sodium sulfate colitis and lipopolysaccharide-induced
      endotoxemia ameliorated tissue damage and mortality, respectively, in mice. These
      in vivo effects of cow milk were abrogated by the simultaneous administration of 
      TGFbeta type I receptor kinase inhibitor with the cow milk, and they were not
      observed after the oral administration of cow's milk containing little TGFbeta.
      In humans, 1 oral challenge of 10 mL/kg cow milk containing TGFbeta (3 microg/L) 
      increased the plasma TGFbeta concentrations at 4 h after the challenge. Thus,
      some commercially available pasteurized cow milk retains TGFbeta activity, which 
      may be able to provide protection against experimental colitis and endotoxemia
      associated with increased intestinal and circulating TGFbeta levels.

TI  - Detection of shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC) in diarrhoeagenic stool &
      meat samples in Mangalore, India.
PG  - 271-7
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC) are causative
      agents of bloody diarrhoea, haemorrhagic colitis (HC) and haemolytic uraemic
      syndrome (HUS). Humans acquire infections primarily through contaminated beef. In
      India, STEC has not been implicated as a major cause of diarrhoea. Hence,
      isolation of STEC from diarrhoeagenic stool samples of patients and beef samples 
      marketed through retail outlets was attempted in Mangalore, India. METHODS:
      Diarrhoeagenic stool samples (n = 192) and meat samples (n = 103) were screened
      for STEC, using conventional culture methods and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
      from December 2003 to 2006 in the department of Microbiology, Kasturba Medical
      College, Mangalore. All the E. coli isolates were subjected to antibiotic
      susceptibility testing and serotyping. RESULTS: Of the 40 eae positive E. coli
      isolates from meat sample, one was positive for all the STEC genes, namely stx1, 
      stx2, rfb O157 and EHEC hlyA. This isolate belonged to O157 serogroup. Of the 110
      eae positive E. coli isolated from stool samples, two were positive for EHEC hlyA
      and belonged to serogroup O8 and one was positive for bfp gene and found to be of
      O6 serogroup. Among the 192 stool enrichment broths tested, 160 were positive for
      eae gene, of which two were EHEC hlyA positive and one was bfp gene positive.
      Among the 103 meat enrichment cultures, 90 were positive for eae gene and one
      among them was positive for all the STEC genes. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Our 
      results showed a low incidence of STEC and high prevalence of eae positive E.
      coli other than STEC in stool and meat samples. A low positivity was observed for
      PCR performed directly on stool and meat samples. However, PCR on enrichment
      cultures gave better results. Since E. coli O157 was isolated and detected by PCR
      in one of the meat samples, this organism may be of public health significance. A
      study on a large sample may provide some answer.

TI  - Effects of a supplementary diet with specially processed cereals in patients with
      short bowel syndrome.
PG  - 1085-93
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0b013e328303c00a [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Short bowel syndrome patients frequently experience impaired
      health-related quality of life. This syndrome is also associated with increased
      costs for the individuals concerned and the community. Intake of specially
      processed cereals has been demonstrated to decrease intestinal secretion. This
      study evaluates the effect of a supplementary diet with specially processed
      cereals compared with nonprocessed cereals. METHODS: This investigation is a
      randomized double-blind, cross-over multicentre prospective study of 26
      intestinal resected out patients, considered as short bowel syndrome patients.
      The patients were divided into groups A or B, in accordance with the first
      allocated treatment. Subgroup analyses of the underlying diagnoses and type of
      surgical procedure were performed. The studied parameters were faecal volume,
      nocturnal stools, abdominal pain/discomfort, health-related quality of life,
      peripheral blood tests and anthropometric data. RESULTS: In both groups, intake
      of nonprocessed cereals significantly decreased the faecal volume. The subgroup
      analyses of patients with a history of ulcerative colitis (compared with Crohn's 
      disease) and nonileostomy-operated procedure (compared with ileostomi-operated
      procedure) showed significantly decreased faecal volume during nonprocessed
      cereals intake. Peripheral blood tests, quality of life and anthropometry were
      not affected. CONCLUSION: In this study, nonprocessed cereals seemed to be as
      effective as specially processed cereals in decreasing faecal volume in general
      and especially in ulcerative colitis patients (mainly operated with nonileostomy 
      techniques). Our results indicate that use of supplementary cereals is safe for
      this group of patients, but should optimally include evaluation of the underlying
      diagnosis and the surgical method used.

TI  - A short-oligonucleotide microarray that allows improved detection of
      gastrointestinal tract microbial communities.
PG  - 195
LID - 10.1186/1471-2180-8-195 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The human gastrointestinal (GI) tract contains a diverse collection
      of bacteria, most of which are unculturable by conventional microbiological
      methods. Increasingly molecular profiling techniques are being employed to
      examine this complex microbial community. The purpose of this study was to
      develop a microarray technique based on 16S ribosomal gene sequences for rapidly 
      monitoring the microbial population of the GI tract. RESULTS: We have developed a
      culture-independent, semi-quantitative, rapid method for detection of gut
      bacterial populations based on 16S rDNA probes using a DNA microarray. We
      compared the performance of microarrays based on long (40- and 50-mer) and short 
      (16-21-mer) oligonucleotides. Short oligonucleotides consistently gave higher
      specificity. Optimal DNA amplification and labelling, hybridisation and washing
      conditions were determined using a probe with an increasing number of nucleotide 
      mismatches, identifying the minimum number of nucleotides needed to distinguish
      between perfect and mismatch probes. An independent PCR-based control was used to
      normalise different hybridisation results, and to make comparisons between
      different samples, greatly improving the detection of changes in the gut
      bacterial population. The sensitivity of the microarray was determined to be 8.8 
      x 104 bacterial cells g-1 faecal sample, which is more sensitive than a number of
      existing profiling methods. The short oligonucleotide microarray was used to
      compare the faecal flora from healthy individuals and a patient suffering from
      Ulcerative Colitis (UC) during the active and remission states. Differences were 
      identified in the bacterial profiles between healthy individuals and a UC
      patient. These variations were verified by Denaturing Gradient Gel
      Electrophoresis (DGGE) and DNA sequencing. CONCLUSION: In this study we
      demonstrate the design, testing and application of a highly sensitive, short
      oligonucleotide community microarray. Our approach allows the rapid
      discrimination of bacteria inhabiting the human GI tract, at taxonomic levels
      ranging from species to the superkingdom bacteria. The optimised protocol is
      available at: http://www.ifr.ac.uk/safety/microarrays/#protocols. It offers a
      high throughput method for studying the dynamics of the bacterial population over
      time and between individuals.

LID - 10.1089/fpd.2008.0130 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the main virulence factors produced by Shiga toxin-producing
      Escherichia coli is the Shiga toxin (Stx), which is encoded on lambdoid phages
      (Stx phage). In Norway, an outbreak of hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic
      syndrome (HUS) caused by E. coli O103:H25 was reported during the winter of 2006,
      but stx(2)-positive isolates were only retrieved from two human samples. METHODS:
      Isolates of E. coli O103:H25 from patients with HUS in Norway, including sporadic
      cases and the outbreak cases, were investigated for the presence of phages
      encoding stx(2). The induced Stx phages were characterized morphologically and
      genetically, and the host susceptibility for these phages of various E. coli O103
      isolates, including O103:H25 stx(2) negative isolates from the outbreak, was
      tested by a plaque assay. RESULTS: The Stx2 phages in this study are very closely
      related in terms of morphology, sequence identity, and host infectivity. There
      may be a conserved phage within the E. coli O103:H25 population. CONCLUSIONS: It 
      is proposed that the Stx2 phage, present in the environment either as free phage 
      particles or within a limited pool of Stx-producing E. coli O103 strains, have
      infected or integrated in the stx(2)-negative E. coli O103:H25 isolates from the 
      Norwegian outbreak.

PG  - 1829-37
LID - 10.1517/13543780802514500 [doi]
AB  - Collagenous and lymphocytic colitis are the two recognized major presentations of
      microscopic colitis. Both diseases present with chronic watery diarrhea and a
      chronic inflammatory infiltrate in the colonic mucosa without specific endoscopic
      abnormalities, and hence diagnosis is established by histology. Recent
      epidemiological studies suggest that microscopic colitis may affect as many
      patients as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. The cause of these diseases is
      unknown; however, several lines of evidence support the hypothesis of mucosal
      injury from an unknown agent in the fecal stream. Due to the lack of disease
      causality, therapeutic management of microscopic colitis is now directed
      primarily at symptoms' resolution or improvement. Based on current evidence, oral
      budesonide represents an effective treatment option for patients with microscopic
      colitis to achieve and maintain remission. Other anti-inflammatory drugs such as 
      mesalazine or bismuth subsalicylate are now under evaluation. The optimal
      long-term management strategy of microscopic colitis, however, remains an
      unsolved issue.

AB  - Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7, a primary enteric pathogen,
      has been implicated in a wide spectrum of food/water-borne infectious diseases
      such as hemorrhagic colitis (HC) and hemolyticuremic syndrome (HUS). Effective
      treatments for EHEC O157:H7 induced disease are not available yet. Shiga-toxin 2 
      (Stx2) has been related to clinical manifestations of HUS, suggesting its
      critical role in pathology following infection with EHEC O157:H7. Here we report 
      the development of four anti-Stx2-Monoclonal antibodies (McAbs) (5F3and 5C11 for 
      Stx2A, and 1A4 and 1A5 for Stx2B), all of which have strong immunogenicity and
      neutralization activities in vitro and in vivo. The full-length cDNA coding for
      anti-Stx2A McAb, 5F3, was cloned and an engineered antibody was developed whose
      therapeutic effects were evaluated. Our data indicate that the engineered scFv
      together with two new McAbs may be applicable for the prevention and therapy of
      EHEC induced pathology.

TI  - Optimizing conventional therapy for inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 585-90
AB  - Recently, conventional therapies for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have not
      received the same amount of attention as biologic therapies, yet they remain the 
      backbone of therapy for IBD because of their efficacy, safety, and relatively low
      cost. Advances in efficacy and safety continue because of modifications in drug
      dosing and monitoring. Higher doses of mesalamine per pill, together with
      once-daily dosing, may help to optimize drug delivery and patient compliance.
      Budesonide, an effective agent for both induction and short-term remission
      maintenance in Crohn's disease, is devoid of many of the toxicities common to
      corticosteroids. Assessments of thiopurine methyltransferase and metabolite
      levels are helping to fine-tune dose optimization for the thiopurines
      azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine. The oral calcineurin inhibitors tacrolimus and
      cyclosporine have been shown to have expanded roles in IBD, and methotrexate may 
      be useful in some patients with refractory ulcerative colitis. Probiotics are
      showing promise for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease, ulcerative
      colitis, and pouchitis.

TI  - [Distinct clinical characteristics of inflammatory bowel disease in children
      younger than 5 years].
PG  - 132-6
AB  - UNLABELLED: In the last decades an increase in morbidity of inflammatory bowel
      disease, particularly of Crohn disease, in children has been observed. OBJECTIVE:
      Assessment of clinical course and activity of inflammatory bowel disease in
      children younger than 5 years was the goal of the study. MATERIAL AND METHODS:
      The study comprised 21 children aged 2 to 5 years (13 boys and 8 girls) who were 
      diagnosed with: Lesniowski-Crohn disease (7 children), ulcerative colitis (7
      children) and indeterminate colitis (remaining 7 children). RESULTS: Among
      studied children boys prevailed (61.9%). In 6 children the disease started in the
      first and second year of life; the average age of disease onset was 26.9 months
      and the time between the onset of the disease and the diagnosis was 16.6 months. 
      46% of patients came from the cities with population above 100000 when only 23%
      lived in the country. Autoimmune diseases were diagnosed in the families of 6
      children, food or pollen allergy in the families of 11 children. Abdominal pain, 
      diarrhea, presence of blood and mucous in the stool, fever and lack of thrive
      were most apparent in the clinical picture. The pathological changes were present
      mainly in the large intestine and only in one case in the upper part of the
      alimentary tract and jejunum. The observed course of the disease was severe or
      moderate. In two children aged 3 years colectomy was performed. CONCLUSIONS: In
      children younger than 5 years severe and moderate course of the Lesniowski-Crohn 
      disease and ulcerative colitis is apparent. Fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea,
      presence of blood and mucous in the stool and lack of appetite were the most
      often seen symptoms. Pathological changes in children younger than 5 years were
      present mainly in the large intestine and only in single cases in the upper part 
      of the alimentary tract and jejunum. In children with inflammatory bowel disease 
      a frequent occurrence of allergy, bronchitis, pneumonia and urinary tract
      infection, which required antibiotics, was observed.

TI  - Chemoprevention of colorectal cancer: feasibility in everyday practice?
PG  - 502-14
LID - 10.1097/CEJ.0b013e3282f0c080 [doi]
AB  - Chemoprevention means the use of agents to prevent, delay, or reverse
      carcinogenesis. This review was designed to critically discuss the most promising
      agents in colorectal cancer (CRC) chemoprevention. Aspirin is the best studied
      chemopreventive agent for CRC. Optimal chemoprevention requires long-term use and
      high dose of aspirin that may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
      Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors
      may also be candidates for chemoprevention. The regular use of nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs, however, causes adverse effects including
      gastrointestinal bleeding, and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors may increase the risk 
      of cardiovascular events. In patients with ulcerative colitis 5-aminosalicylates 
      reduce the risk of CRC and dysplasia. Ursodeoxycholic acid can reduce the risk of
      dysplasia or CRC in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis and ulcerative
      colitis. Current data are insufficient to support the use of hormone replacement 
      therapy to reduce the risk of CRC. Statins may have chemopreventive effects, but 
      further investigation of their overall benefits in preventing CRC is warranted.
      Antioxidant supplements cannot prevent CRC. The usefulness of selenium, folate,
      calcium, and vitamin D awaits further evaluation. Chemoprevention cannot yet be
      accepted as standard medical practice. Use of chemopreventive agents cannot be a 
      substitute for colorectal surveillance.

AB  - Diverticular disease (DD) of the colon is common. This paper reviews the evidence
      supporting the role of some of the conventional medical therapies such as fiber
      and nonabsorbable antibiotics in the treatment of DD. More importantly, it will
      review the emerging body of evidence supporting the use of 5-aminosalicylic acid 
      and probiotics for symptomatic or complicated DD. Possible mechanisms supporting 
      the role of 5-aminosalicylates will also be discussed. On the basis of strength
      of the evidence supporting each medical intervention, recommendations will be
      graded in an evidence-based fashion. Finally, an evidence-based algorithmic
      approach is proposed for the medical management of DD. This paper does not
      discuss the use of absorbable antibiotics such as ciprofloxin and metronidazole, 
      which are discussed in all standard textbooks. The purpose of this paper is to
      discuss newer recommendations.

AB  - A decrease in the abundance and biodiversity of intestinal bacteria within the
      dominant phylum Firmicutes has been observed repeatedly in Crohn disease (CD)
      patients. In this study, we determined the composition of the mucosa-associated
      microbiota of CD patients at the time of surgical resection and 6 months later
      using FISH analysis. We found that a reduction of a major member of Firmicutes,
      Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, is associated with a higher risk of postoperative
      recurrence of ileal CD. A lower proportion of F. prausnitzii on resected ileal
      Crohn mucosa also was associated with endoscopic recurrence at 6 months. To
      evaluate the immunomodulatory properties of F. prausnitzii we analyzed the
      anti-inflammatory effects of F. prausnitzii in both in vitro (cellular models)
      and in vivo [2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS)-induced] colitis in mice.
      In Caco-2 cells transfected with a reporter gene for NF-kappaB activity, F.
      prausnitzii had no effect on IL-1beta-induced NF-kappaB activity, whereas the
      supernatant abolished it. In vitro peripheral blood mononuclear cell stimulation 
      by F. prausnitzii led to significantly lower IL-12 and IFN-gamma production
      levels and higher secretion of IL-10. Oral administration of either live F.
      prausnitzii or its supernatant markedly reduced the severity of TNBS colitis and 
      tended to correct the dysbiosis associated with TNBS colitis, as demonstrated by 
      real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis. F. prausnitzii exhibits
      anti-inflammatory effects on cellular and TNBS colitis models, partly due to
      secreted metabolites able to block NF-kappaB activation and IL-8 production.
      These results suggest that counterbalancing dysbiosis using F. prausnitzii as a
      probiotic is a promising strategy in CD treatment.

TI  - Chronic inflammatory changes in the anal transition zone after stapled ileal
      pouch-anal anastomosis: is mucosectomy a superior alternative?
PG  - 533-7; discussion 537-9
LID - 10.1016/j.surg.2008.06.003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic inflammation (CI) is commonly found in the anal transition
      zone (ATZ) after stapled ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) for ulcerative
      colitis (UC). Yet, its impact on defecatory function and the need for a complete 
      mucosectomy has not been completely elucidated. This study aims to evaluate the
      long-term functional outcomes of patients with CI of the ATZ after stapled IPAA
      in comparison with mucosectomy patients. METHODS: Between June 1987 and November 
      2007, 66 UC patients were found to have CI of the ATZ after stapled IPAA and were
      compared with 228 UC patients who underwent mucosectomy with hand-sewn (HS) IPAA.
      Patients were mailed a questionnaire to assess defecatory function and quality of
      life. Data were analyzed prospectively. RESULTS: No differences were observed in 
      age, sex, number, or consistency of bowel movements (BMs) between groups.
      Complete continence was reported by 90.3% of CI and 66.8% of HS patients (P <
      .001). The CI group also had a significantly lower rate of major incontinence (P 
      < .001). Functional parameters in favor of the CI group included the ability to
      discriminate between gas and stool (P < .001), the use of protective pads during 
      both the day and the night (P < .001), dietary modifications in the timing of
      meals (P < .001) and type of food (P = .005), and the presence of perianal rash
      (P = .019). In the CI group, more patients rated their quality of life as
      improved from before the operation (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Preservation of the
      ATZ, even in presence of persistent inflammation, confers improved continence,
      better functional outcomes, and superior quality of life.

AB  - Pemetrexed is U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved as a second line,
      single-agent treatment of recurrent metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.
      Gastrointestinal side effects, including stomatitis, diarrhea, and vomiting are
      reported to be less than 1% and rarely severe. In the premetrexed clinical trial 
      database of 1327 patients, various types of colitis were reported by a total of
      nine patients (0.6%). Typhilitis is a gastrointestinal complication of
      chemotherapy, which presents as fever and abdominal pain. The diagnosis is
      supported by the findings of bowel wall thickening on computed tomographic
      imaging. Typhilitis is usually seen in the setting of severe chemotherapy-induced
      neutropenia for acute leukemia. Nevertheless, it is increasingly recognized as a 
      complication of therapy in solid tumors. We present the first documented case of 
      typhilitis after treatment with pemetrexed and successful therapy with supportive
      treatment.

TI  - High prevalence of vitamin K and D deficiency and decreased BMD in inflammatory
      bowel disease.
PG  - 935-42
LID - 10.1007/s00198-008-0764-2 [doi]
AB  - SUMMARY: Vitamin K and D deficiency and decreased bone mineral density (BMD) were
      highly prevalent in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially
      Crohn's disease (CD). Dietary intakes of these vitamins, however, were above the 
      Japanese adequate intakes in IBD patients, suggesting that malabsorption is the
      basis for hypovitaminosis K and D and decreased BMD. INTRODUCTION: We have
      studied the possible involvement of vitamin K and D deficiency in the
      pathogenesis of decreased BMD in IBD. METHODS: Seventy patients with IBD were
      evaluated for their BMD; plasma levels of vitamin K; phylloquinone (PK),
      menaquinone-7 (MK-7), and 25OH-D; serum PTH, protein induced by vitamin K absence
      (PIVKA-II), and undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) levels; and their food
      intake. RESULTS: Compared with ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, CD patients had 
      significantly lower plasma vitamin K and 25OH-D concentrations; significantly
      higher serum levels of PTH, PIVKA-II, and ucOC; and significantly lower BMD
      scores at almost all measurement sites. More IBD patients were vitamin K
      deficient in bone than in liver. Multiple regression analyses revealed that low
      plasma concentrations of vitamin K and 25OH-D were independent risk factors for
      low BMD and that they were associated with the patients' fat intake, but not with
      their intake of these vitamins. CONCLUSION: IBD patients have high prevalence of 
      decreased BMD and vitamin K and D deficiency probably caused by malabsorption of 
      these vitamins.

PG  - 1802-7
LID - 10.1016/j.intimp.2008.08.021 [doi]
AB  - Apple procyanidins (ACT) is a natural biologically active compound extracted from
      apple. Our recent studies have shown that ACT ameliorates the symptoms of atopic 
      dermatitis and inhibits food-allergen-induced oral sensitization. The aim of this
      study was to investigate the potential protective effect and mechanism of action 
      of ACT in a murine model of inflammatory bowel disease. We investigated the
      preventive effects of ACT in experimental models of colitis induced by dextran
      sulfate sodium (DSS) or oxazolone. Oral administration of ACT before DSS
      treatment attenuated the DSS-induced mortality rate and decreased body weight
      loss. ACT also prevented the body weight loss associated with oxazolone-induced
      colitis. Next we examined the effect of ACT on intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL),
      which is a major T cell population in the intestine. Oral administration of ACT
      increased the proportions of TCRgammadelta and TCRalphabeta-CD8alphaalpha T cells
      in IEL and suppressed interferon gamma synthesis in stimulated IEL. In addition, 
      ACT inhibited phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced secretion of interleukin 8 
      (IL-8) in intestinal epithelial cells. The combined anti-inflammatory and
      immunomodulatory effects of ACT on intestinal epithelial cells and IEL suggest
      that it may be an effective oral preventive agent for inflammatory bowel
      diseases.

TI  - Thirty four years since the discovery of gastrointestinal melatonin.
PG  - 33-51
AB  - After the discovery of melatonin in the pineal gland by Lerner and co-workers in 
      1958, melatonin was also detected in the retina and the human appendix. Later,
      melatonin was confirmed immunohistologically in all segments of the
      gastrointestinal tract (GIT), in the guts of bovine embryos and in the GIT of low
      vertebrates. Melatonin was also confirmed in the pancreas and the hepatobiliary
      system. Melatonin is produced in the enteroendocrine cells of the GIT mucosa. The
      concentrations of melatonin in the GIT are 10-100x higher than in the plasma and 
      the total amount of melatonin in the GIT is around 400x higher than the amount of
      melatonin in the pineal gland. Similar to pineal melatonin, GIT melatonin is a
      multifunctional compound which exhibits some general as well as some specific
      effects, depending on the organ and the location of GIT tissue. In the GIT,
      melatonin exhibits endocrine, paracrine, autocrine and luminal actions.
      Generally, the episodic secretion of melatonin from the GIT is related to the
      intake and digestion of food and to the prevention of tissue damage caused by
      hydrochloric acid and digestive enzymes. Some actions, such as the scavenging of 
      hydroxyl free radicals, immunoenhancement and antioxidant effects are of general 
      nature, whereas others, such as an increase of mucosal blood flow, the reduction 
      of peristalsis and the regulation of fecal water content, are specific to the
      tubular GIT. Generally, melatonin actions oppose those of serotonin. Laboratory
      and clinical studies indicate that the utilization of melatonin can prevent or
      treat pathological conditions such as esophageal and gastric ulcers,
      pancreatitis, colitis, irritable bowel disease, and colon cancer.

TI  - Microbial biofilm communities in the gastrointestinal tract.
PG  - S142-3
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0b013e31816207df [doi]
AB  - The human gastrointestinal tract is colonized throughout its length by complex
      luminal and mucosal microbiotas. Owing to sampling restrictions, most of the
      studies done to date have concentrated on luminal material. Recently, however,
      there has been an upsurge in interest in the role of microbial communities that
      occur in biofilms on surfaces in the gut. In the human biota, biofilms have been 
      shown to exist on artificial surfaces and devices implanted in the host, on
      particulate materials in the gut lumen, and on the colonic mucosa. Owing to their
      proximity to host tissues, mucosal bacteria interact more readily with the gut
      epithelium and immune system than their luminal counterparts, and recent research
      indicates that they play an important role in health and disease processes.
      Because bacteria growing in biofilms are more resistant to antibiotics than their
      luminal counterparts, there is increased interest in the use of alternative
      therapeutic strategies to target potential pathogens on the mucosal surface,
      especially with respect to applications involving probiotics, prebiotics, and
      synbiotics.

TI  - Balsalazide plus high-potency probiotic preparation (VSL[sharp]3) in the
      treatment of acute mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis and uncomplicated
      diverticulitis of the colon.
PG  - S119-22
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0b013e31815f5ac7 [doi]
AB  - Balsalazide is a 5-amino salicylic acid prodrug well-tolerated and effective in
      treating acute ulcerative colitis. VSL[sharp]3, a high-potency probiotic mixture,
      has proved to be effective in preventing flare-ups of chronic pouchitis and in
      obtaining remission of mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. Recent studies found 
      the association of low-dose balsalazide/VLS no. 3 effective in treating
      mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis and in preventing the recurrence of
      uncomplicated diverticulitis of the colon. In this paper, the framework for using
      this association to treat ulcerative colitis or to prevent the recurrence of
      colonic diverticulitis is reviewed, and 2 studies on this therapeutic approach
      are briefly summarized.

      of ulcerative colitis in children and adolescents: an open-label pilot study.
PG  - 874-5
LID - 10.1055/s-2008-1027463 [doi]
AB  - Since about 20 % of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) are children and
      adolescents there is a need for therapeutic options custom-tailored to the
      children's needs. E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) as an evidence-based probiotic
      alternative to mesalazine (5-ASA) in adult UC remission maintenance is a
      promising agent for such a therapy. The present open-labelled pilot study was
      undertaken to investigate the clinical benefit of EcN for maintenance therapy in 
      young UC patients. 34 patients with UC in remission aged between 11 and 18 years 
      were allocated either to EcN (2 capsules o. d., n = 24) or 5-ASA (median 1.5 g/d,
      n = 10) and observed over one year. As a result, the relapse rate was 25 % (6 /
      24) in the EcN group and 30 % (3 / 10) in the 5-ASA group. Data on the patients' 
      global health and development were favourable and no serious adverse events were 
      reported. In conclusion, maintenance therapy for UC with the probiotic EcN is
      effective also in young patients.

TI  - Intestinal inflammation in nursing infants: different causes and a single
      treatment ... but of protected origin.
PG  - 144-50
AB  - Three case histories of nursing infants suffering from different forms of
      intestinal problems, who underwent special dietary therapy in order to solve
      situations that would be difficult to deal with using the special artificial milk
      varieties on the market, are presented. These children were administered a
      homemade food consisting ofParmigiano Reggiano cheese seasoned for at least 36
      months, rice or maize custard and tapioca, sugar, maize oil. In the first case
      the diagnosis of "widespread nonspecific acute colitis" was made compatible with 
      "antibiotic-associated colitis" and Clostridium difficile was isolated from the
      feces. The second case, under the suspicion of cow's milk allergy, was fed by
      soya and hydrolyzed milk with persitent disturbed alvus with greenish feces and
      mucus. The third case was represented by a nursing child with persistent
      diarrhoic alvus after an acute episode with subsequent intolerance to rice milk. 
      After the introduction of the food based on Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, all cases
      showed a rapid and progressive improvement of symptoms and alvus characteristics 
      and were discharged with increased weight. The Parmigiano Reggiano cheese shows a
      high concentration of easily absorbed amino acids and oligopeptides like a
      hydrolyzed proteic preparation. As regards the lipoid component the medium and
      short chain fatty acids are directly absorbed in the bowel and immediately usable
      as a significant source of energy. Finally, another relevant characteristic of
      Parmigiano Reggiano cheese is the complete absence of lactose. The use of
      Parmigiano Reggiano cheese as a dietary therapy is appropriate not only for its
      high nutritional value, but also for its characteristics as a functional food
      that produces beneficial effects on health with regards to the gastrointestinal
      tract and the inflammatory problems resulting from alimentary intolerance,
      post-therapeutic antibiotic dismicrobism, or post-infective conditions. Moreover,
      its efficay on these pathologic conditions is further improved by the prebiotic
      and probiotic effects resulting from the oligosaccharides and the bacterial flora
      of this natural food product, only derived from the nature and the work of
      skilled artisans closely tied to tradition.

      barrier function.
PG  - G1025-34
LID - 10.1152/ajpgi.90227.2008 [doi]
AB  - Live probiotic bacteria are effective in reducing gut permeability and
      inflammation. We have previously shown that probiotics release peptide bioactive 
      factors that modulate epithelial resistance in vitro. The objectives of this
      study were to determine the impact of factors released from Bifidobacteria
      infantis on intestinal epithelial cell permeability and tight junction proteins
      and to assess whether these factors retain their bioactivity when administered to
      IL-10-deficient mice. B. infantis conditioned medium (BiCM) was applied to T84
      human epithelial cells in the presence and absence of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma.
      Transepithelial resistance (TER), tight junction proteins [claudins 1, 2, 3, and 
      4, zonula occludens (ZO)-1, and occludin] and MAP kinase activity (p38 and ERK)
      were examined. Acute effects of BiCM on intestinal permeability were assessed in 
      colons from IL-10-deficient mice in Ussing chambers. A separate group of
      IL-1-deficient mice was treated with BiCM for 4 wk and then assessed for
      intestinal histological injury, cytokine levels, epithelial permeability, and
      immune response to bacterial antigens. In T84 cells, BiCM increased TER,
      decreased claudin-2, and increased ZO-1 and occludin expression. This was
      associated with enhanced levels of phospho-ERK and decreased levels of
      phospho-p38. BiCM prevented TNF-alpha- and IFN-gamma-induced drops in TER and
      rearrangement of tight junction proteins. Inhibition of ERK prevented the
      BiCM-induced increase in TER and attenuated the protection from TNF-alpha and
      IFN-gamma. Oral BiCM administration acutely reduced colonic permeability in mice 
      whereas long-term BiCM treatment in IL-10-deficient mice attenuated inflammation,
      normalized colonic permeability, and decreased colonic and splenic IFN-gamma
      secretion. In conclusion, peptide bioactive factors from B. infantis retain their
      biological activity in vivo and are effective in normalizing gut permeability and
      improving disease in an animal model of colitis. The effects of BiCM are mediated
      in part by changes in MAP kinases and tight junction proteins.

      and synbiotics.
PG  - 167-84
AB  - Pathogenesis of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases(Ulcerative Colitis, Crohn's disease
      and Pouchitis) includes an abnormal immunological response to disturbed
      intestinal microflora. Therapeutic strategies are designed to intervene in these 
      abnormal host microbial communications. A novel approach in the last decade has
      been to use other bacteria or selective foods to induce beneficial bacteria to
      normalize inflammation. In this review we discuss rationale for such use and
      describe 46 clinical trials gleaned from the literature. Reports are divided into
      type, indications, and agents used. The search revealed 15 nonrandomized and 31
      randomized trials. Of the latter 23 were double-blind and 8 were open-label
      randomized controlled. In 32 of the total, different probiotics were used, while 
      10 and 4 used different prebiotics or synbiotics respectively. In 14
      nonrandomized trials, outcome was successful. In the randomized controlled trials
      12 of 16 ulcerative colitis but only 2 of Crohn's disease trials of biotic
      therapy were successful. No superiority of any probiotic was clearly evident, but
      a multi-agent mixture, VSL3# may be better suited in ulcerative colitis and
      pouchitis while the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG appears less useful in
      inflammatory bowel disease, especially Crohn's disease. Further studies with
      uniform stringent criteria are needed to provide proof of this therapy in
      inflammatory bowel disease.

PG  - 5138-48
AB  - The gastrointestinal innate and adaptive immune system continuously faces the
      challenge of potent stimuli from the commensal microflora and food constituents. 
      These local immune responses require a tight control, the outcome of which is in 
      most cases the induction of tolerance. Local T cell immunity is an important
      compartment of the specific intestinal immune system. T cell reactivity is
      programmed during the initial stage of its activation by professional presenting 
      cells. Mucosal dendritic cells (DCs) are assumed to play key roles in regulating 
      immune responses in the antigen-rich gastrointestinal environment. Mucosal DCs
      are a heterogeneous population that can either initiate (innate and adaptive)
      immune responses, or control intestinal inflammation and maintain tolerance.
      Defects in this regulation are supposed to lead to the two major forms of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis
      (UC). This review will discuss the emerging role of mucosal DCs in regulating
      intestinal inflammation and immune responses.

AB  - Infection by the food-borne pathogen enterohemorragic Escherichia coli (EHEC) can
      lead to diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, and, in the most serious cases, renal
      failure. A critical step in colonization is the unusual interaction between EHEC 
      and the intestinal epithelium. EHEC is able to adhere to mammalian cells, and
      then, by injecting bacterial proteins, or "effectors," into the host cell via a
      type III secretion system, induces the formation of attaching and effacing (AE)
      lesions characterized by the accumulation of filamentous actin directly beneath
      bound bacteria. This unit describes methods to evaluate the ability of EHEC to
      adhere to cultured mammalian cells, to secrete type III effectors, and to promote
      the formation of actin "pedestals." These methods can not only be used to
      evaluate the contribution of specific EHEC gene products to adherence, type III
      secretion, and mammalian cell signaling, but also facilitate the analysis of the 
      eukaryotic pathways controlling fundamental cellular processes such as actin
      assembly.

TI  - A meta-analysis of the efficacy of sulfasalazine in comparison with
      5-aminosalicylates in the induction of improvement and maintenance of remission
      in patients with ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1157-70
LID - 10.1007/s10620-008-0481-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Historically, sulfasalazine (SSZ) and 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASAs)
      have been a mainstay of mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis (UC) remission
      induction and maintenance therapy. Considering the pivotal role of intestinal
      microbial flora in pathophysiology of UC and antimicrobial activity of
      sulfapyridine, we hypothesized that SSZ might be more effective than 5-ASAs in
      the management of UC. AIM: To compare the efficacy and tolerability of SSZ with
      each of the 5-ASAs (mesalamine, olsalazine, and balsalazide) by a meta-analysis
      technique. METHODS: Pubmed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central 
      Register of Controlled Trials were searched for studies compared efficacy and/or 
      tolerability of SSZ with 5-ASAs in the management of UC. The search terms were:
      "sulfasalazine" or "sulfasalazine" and "5-aminosalicylic acid," "mesalazine,"
      "mesalamine," "olsalazine" or "balsalazide" and "ulcerative colitis." Data were
      collected from 1966 to April 2008. There was no language restriction. "Overall
      improvement," "relapse rate," "total adverse events," and "withdrawals because of
      adverse events" were the key outcomes of interest. RESULTS: Twenty randomized
      placebo controlled trials met our criteria and were included in the
      meta-analysis. Comparison of SSZ with mesalamine yielded a nonsignificant
      relative risk (RR) of 1.04 (95% confidence interval of 0.89-1.21, P = 0.63) for
      overall improvement, a nonsignificant RR of 0.98 (95% CI 0.78-1.23, P = 0.85) for
      relapse, a nonsignificant RR of 0.76 (95% CI 0.54-1.07, P = 0.11) for any adverse
      events, and a nonsignificant RR of 0.78 (95% CI 0.46-1.3, P = 0.33) for
      withdrawals due to adverse events. Comparison of SSZ with olsalazine yielded a
      nonsignificant RR of 1.14 (95% CI 0.91-1.43, P = 0.25) for overall improvement, a
      nonsignificant RR of 0.93 (95% CI 0.77-1.12, P = 0.42) for relapse, a
      nonsignificant RR of 1.21 (95% CI 0.9-1.61, P = 0.20) for any adverse events, and
      a nonsignificant RR of 1.53 (95% CI 0.93-2.52, P = 0.09) for withdrawals due to
      adverse events. Comparison of SSZ with balsalazide yielded a nonsignificant RR of
      1.3 (95% CI 0.93-1.81, P = 0.12) for overall improvement, and a significant RR of
      0.17 (95% CI 0.06-0.49, P = 0.001) for withdrawals because of adverse events.
      CONCLUSION: SSZ does not differ from mesalamine or olsalazine in terms of
      efficacy and tolerability in UC. Withdrawal from study due to adverse events was 
      significantly lower for balsalazide compared with SSZ. Convincing conclusions on 
      the comparison of effectiveness and safety of balsalazide and SSZ in UC remains
      to be elucidated by further clinical trials. Considering the lower cost of
      treatment with SSZ and the equal rate of adverse events with other 5-ASAa, it is 
      not surprising to suggest SSZ as a first-choice treatment for UC and reserve
      5-ASAs for when SSZ intolerability occurs.

LID - 10.1055/s-0028-1082811 [doi]
AB  - HISTORY AND CLINICAL FINDINGS: A 43 years old worker of a fish factory was
      admitted for spasmodic lower abdominal pain lasting for some hours. Physical
      examination revealed diffuse abdominal tenderness with a maximum in the right
      upper and lower abdomen. INVESTIGATIONS: Laboratory values showed a slight rise
      in leucocytes with otherwise normal inflammation parameters. In abdominal
      ultrasonography some free fluid in the gallbaldder region and an impressing
      thickening of the walls of the ascending and transverse colon were found. A CT
      scan described an "intraluminal process" and a pericolic infiltration. TREATMENT 
      AND COURSE: Laparoscopy was performed and revealed a swelling of the whole right 
      colon with pronounced edema. After an extension to laparotomy and colotomy,
      massive mucosal edema was seen (explaining the intraluminal process);
      furthermore, there was a filiform whitish structure of around 15 mm length in the
      colonic mucosa. Histology ascertained the macroscopic diagnosis of a small worm
      which was identified as an anisakis larva. After intraoperative removal of the
      worm and an anthelminthic therapy the patient's complaints and the impressing
      mucosal edema disappeared completely. CONCLUSIONS: Anisakiasis is a very rare
      infection in Germany. In single cases, a history of the place of work may be
      helpful in diagnosis. Usually the larva penetrate into gastric or intestinal
      mucosa. The case presented here illustrates the possibility of an anisakiasis
      infection in severe and otherwise unexplainable segmental colitis, especially
      with a history of a possible ingestion of raw fish.

LID - 10.1016/j.mimet.2008.05.014 [doi]
AB  - Shiga toxins and Shiga-like toxins (Stx) are a relatively large group of
      cytotoxins produced by certain serotypes of Shigella and E. coli (STEC). These
      toxins are responsible for diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis and may induce hemolytic
      uremic syndrome (HUS) with serious consequences in young children. The toxins are
      proteins made up of 5 small B subunits responsible for binding to an outer
      membrane ligand on host cells and surround the larger, biologically active A
      subunit. For Shiga-like toxin 1 (Stx1), the cellular receptor is the carbohydrate
      globotriose. Stx1was purified from STEC. We utilized induction of apoptosis in
      the human monocyte cell line THP-1, as a biological endpoint to test the
      stability of Stx1 activity added to fruit punch at different pH (2-9) and
      temperatures (4 and 20 degrees C). A flow cytometric method was used to test for 
      early and late apoptotic events based on binding of R-phycoerytherin-labeled
      annexin V to exposed membrane phosphatidyl serine. Membrane permeability to
      7-Amino-actinomycin corresponds with late apoptosis or necrosis. The combination 
      of acid pH and higher storage temperature resulted in greatest degree of toxin
      inactivation. This approach provides a rapid and high throughput method to
      determine the functional activity of Stx1, and related toxins in a food matrix.

TI  - [Acute infectious diarrhea in adults].
PG  - 1179-86
AB  - Acute infectious diarrhoea are common and usually self-limited but their
      management is often inadequate due to over-prescriptions of stool cultures and
      antibiotics. From a clinical point of view, the most important point is to
      promptly identify presentations at risk of complications (severe dehydration,
      septic shock, surgical complications) such as elderly patients, co-morbidity,
      diabetes, renal or heart deficiency, immune deficiency...). When the
      epidemiological context is suggestive, physicians have to systematically consider
      certain clinical forms potentially at risk of severe outcome: collective food
      poisoning, E. coli O157:H7 bloody diarrhoea with the risk of hemolytic-uremic
      syndrome or antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis due to Clostridium
      difficile. Rehydration, including Na, K and glucose, remains the corner stone of 
      the treatment, symptomatic medications being of limited interest and antibiotics 
      reserved to presentations at risk of complications.

AB  - Probiotic bacteria are normal inhabitants of microflora and may confer several
      benefits, including prevention against intestinal inflammation. However, the
      exact mode of action of probiotics is still largely unknown. The first line of
      defense against the entry of pathogens is represented by the gut membrane barrier
      and probiotics may prevent pathogen-induced membrane damage by inhibiting
      pathogen adhesion and maintaining the correct organization of the tight junction 
      and cytoskeleton proteins. The gut immune system should not only protect the
      mucosa against pathogens, but also avoid hypersensitivity reactions to food
      proteins and normal microflora. Failure of induction or maintenance of oral
      tolerance has been postulated to be a cause of food allergy. Feeding probiotic
      bacteria may prevent or ameliorate the onset of allergic disease and the
      associated inflammatory reactions through mechanisms involving modulation of T
      regulatory cells. Breakdown in tolerance toward intestinal bacteria is a primary 
      cause of inflammatory bowel disease. Recent studies have shown that probiotics
      may ameliorate experimental colitis in mice by inducing interleukin 10 and
      interleukin 10-dependent T regulatory cells. In this article, an update of the
      anti-inflammatory activity of different probiotics and of the more accredited
      mechanisms underlying such activities are reported.

AB  - Cow's milk protein-induced proctocolitis presents with overt rectal bleeding in
      otherwise healthy infants and is characterized by an eosinophilic infiltrate of
      the left colonic mucosa. Although it is the most common cause of proctocolitis in
      infancy, dietary protein-induced proctocolitis had hardly ever been reported in
      childhood so far. We hereby report 16 otherwise healthy children aged 2-14 yr,
      who presented over a 6-yr period with persistent or recurrent rectal bleeding
      related to a mild form of left-sided colitis characterized by a prominent
      eosinophilic infiltration, focal lymphoid follicle hyperplasia, and a prompt
      clinical and histological response to a cow's milk-free diet. No patient had a
      history of food-induced proctocolitis during infancy, and most patients did not
      show an IgE-mediated response to cow's milk protein. Half of the patients did
      have other gastrointestinal symptoms, but no systemic symptoms were present and
      other causes of colitis were excluded by appropriate investigation. Tolerance to 
      cow's milk protein developed in half of the patients within a year. Dietary
      protein-induced proctocolitis is a relatively common cause of overt rectal
      bleeding in childhood, and its features are remarkably similar to those of
      dietary protein-induced proctocolitis of infancy.

      cells.
PG  - 565-9
LID - 10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.07.063 [doi]
AB  - A system for assessing the anti-inflammatory effect of food factors was developed
      by establishing a co-culture system with intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells
      (apical side) and macrophage RAW264.7 cells (basolateral side). In this system,
      the stimulation of RAW264.7 cells with lipopolysaccharide was followed by a
      decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance, which is a marker of the
      integrity of the Caco-2 monolayer and an increase in TNF-alpha production from
      RAW264.7 cells and IL-8 mRNA expression in Caco-2 cells. Treatment with
      anti-TNF-alpha antibodies or budesonide suppressed in increase in TNF-alpha
      production and IL-8 mRNA expression. These results indicated that this co-culture
      model could imitate the gut inflammation in vivo. In addition, fucoidan,
      sulphated polysaccharides from brown algae, was employed as a candidate of
      evolution and added to the apical side of this model. Fucoidan suppressed IL-8
      gene expression through a reduction in TNF-alpha production from RAW264.7 cells
      stimulated with lipopolysaccharide.

AB  - Difficulty intubation is the most common long-term complication after continent
      ileostomy, which can be associated with nipple valve slippage, parastomal hernia,
      stenosis. Diagnosis and management of a patient with nipple valve stricture and
      partial bowel obstruction associated with dietary supplement retention in the
      pouch reservoir is described. A 50-year-old female patient with ulcerative
      colitis and a 15-year history of continent ileostomy after total proctocolectomy 
      reported 5-week symptoms of abdominal pain and difficulty in intubating the
      pouch. Pill bezoar composed of dietary supplement was found in diagnostic pouch
      endoscopy. Therapeutic pouch endoscopy was performed with balloon dilation of a
      nipple valve stenosis and retrieval of 224 dietary supplement tablets. Pill
      bezoar in the pouch is rare. However, patients with continent ileostomy should be
      advised to avoid taking hard-to-dissolve foods and medications.

TI  - [The efficacy of probiotics in gastrointestinal disease].
PG  - 1385-90
AB  - Probiotics are live microbial feed supplement which beneficially affects the host
      animals by improving its microbial balance. Probiotics have been used in the
      treatment of bacterial or viral induced acute intestinal infection. In recent
      years, some clinical studies have shown the therapeutic effects of probiotics in 
      the treatment of chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or prevention of
      allergic disease. Evidence exists for therapeutic use of probiotics in acute
      infectious diarrhea, Clostridium difficile colitis and antibiotic-associated
      diarrhea. Their exact role in IBD, irritable bowel syndrome and prevention of
      cancer has not to be determined. This review summarized the data about probiotics
      in gastrointestinal diseases and examine the mechanisms of action related to
      their therapeutic effects.

TI  - Antibacterial activities of semipurified fractions of Quercus infectoria against 
      enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 and its verocytotoxin production.
PG  - 1223-7
AB  - Escherichia coli O157:H7 is one of the most important foodborne pathogens,
      causing nonbloody and bloody diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, and hemolytic uremic 
      syndrome. Use of antibiotics has been demonstrated to result in increased levels 
      of verocytotoxin (VT) production as well as antibiotic resistance. Quercus
      infectoria was investigated for its antibacterial activity against E. coli
      O157:H7 and other VT-producing enterohemorrhagic E. coli (VTEC). The MIC was
      determined by a broth microdilution method, and the MBC was assessed by
      subculturing the bacteria from the wells that showed no apparent growth onto
      Mueller-Hinton agar. The fractions Qi2, Qi3, and Qi4 of Q. infectoria were
      demonstrated to possess good antibacterial activity, with MICs and MBCs ranging
      from 250 to 500 microg/ml. The effect of the effective fraction, Qi4, on the
      production of VT was determined using a reversed passive latex agglutination. The
      results indicate that at 20 h, fraction Qi4 markedly inhibits the release of VT1 
      and VT2 from VTEC cells at both inhibitory and subinhibitory concentrations.
      Furthermore, verotoxicity assay demonstrated that bacterial cultures treated with
      fraction Qi4 exerted less toxic effect on Vero cells. These in vitro results
      clearly indicate that the fraction Qi4 might constitute a promising natural food 
      additive for the control of food poisoning by E. coli O157:H7 as well as other
      VTEC strains.

TI  - A case of ischemic colitis associated with the herbal food supplement ma huang.
PG  - 496-9
LID - 10.3349/ymj.2008.49.3.496 [doi]
AB  - Ischemic colitis is a condition that usually occurs in the elderly, as a form of 
      vascular disease. However, ischemic colitis also occurs, though rarely, in
      healthy young adults. Moreover, food supplements containing Ephedra sinica or ma 
      huang have been linked to adverse central nervous and cardiovascular events. A
      40-year-old man was admitted to our emergency department after 2 episodes of
      abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea that lasted 24 hours. His medical history was 
      unremarkable for risk factors of bowel ischemia, except for well-controlled
      hypertension. However, a weight-loss supplement, Ephedra sinica, had been
      prescribed for daily use during the previous month. Both abdominal/pelvic
      computed tomography and colonoscopy revealed findings compatible with ischemic
      colitis. His conditions spontaneously improved without any serious complications,
      and he was advised to discontinue the use of herbal medications containing
      ephedrine. In this paper, we describe a case of ischemic colitis that was
      potentially linked to the use of ma huang with a review of the relevant
      literature.

AB  - Probiotic research and clinical trials have been forging ahead over the last
      decade. Although much has been learnt in relation to probiotic intestinal
      epithelial-mucosal immune interactions, the evidence for substantial clinical
      efficacy of probiotics continues to progress much slower. This review outlines
      the probiotic clinical studies before 2005 that formed the foundation of
      probiotic clinical trials in inflammatory bowel disease and then examines indepth
      those inflammatory bowel disease probiotic clinical trials published after 2005
      that are leading to new understanding of the role of probiotics in the induction 
      and remission of inflammatory bowel disease in humans.

      diseases.

LID - 10.1002/mnfr.200700289 [doi]
AB  - With regard to inflammatory processes, the main fatty acids of interest are the
      n-6 PUFA arachidonic acid (AA), which is the precursor of inflammatory
      eicosanoids like prostaglandin E(2) and leukotriene B(4), and the n-3 PUFAs
      eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). EPA and DHA are found
      in oily fish and fish oils. EPA and DHA inhibit AA metabolism to inflammatory
      eicosanoids. They also give rise to mediators that are less inflammatory than
      those produced from AA or that are anti-inflammatory. In addition to modifying
      the lipid mediator profile, n-3 PUFAs exert effects on other aspects of
      inflammation like leukocyte chemotaxis and inflammatory cytokine production. Some
      of these effects are likely due to changes in gene expression, as a result of
      altered transcription factor activity. Fish oil has been shown to decrease
      colonic damage and inflammation, weight loss and mortality in animal models of
      colitis. Fish oil supplementation in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases
      results in n-3 PUFA incorporation into gut mucosal tissue and modification of
      inflammatory mediator profiles. Clinical outcomes have been variably affected by 
      fish oil, although some trials report improved gut histology, decreased disease
      activity, use of corticosteroids and relapse.

TI  - Malnutrition and impaired muscle strength in patients with Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis in remission.
PG  - 694-702
LID - 10.1016/j.nut.2008.03.018 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This prospective, controlled, and multicentric study evaluated
      nutritional status, body composition, muscle strength, and quality of life in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease in clinical remission. In addition,
      possible effects of gender, malnutrition, inflammation, and previous prednisolone
      therapy were investigated. METHODS: Nutritional status (subjective global
      assessment [SGA], body mass index, albumin, trace elements), body composition
      (bioelectrical impedance analysis, anthropometry), handgrip strength, and quality
      of life were assessed in 94 patients with Crohn's disease (CD; 61 female and 33
      male, Crohn's Disease Activity Index 71 +/- 47), 50 patients with ulcerative
      colitis (UC; 33 female and 17 male, Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index 3.1 +/-
      1.5), and 61 healthy control subjects (41 female and 20 male) from centers in
      Berlin, Vienna, and Bari. For further analysis of body composition, 47
      well-nourished patients with inflammatory bowel disease were pair-matched by body
      mass index, sex, and age to healthy controls. Data are presented as median
      (25th-75th percentile). RESULTS: Most patients with inflammatory bowel disease
      (74%) were well nourished according to the SGA, body mass index, and serum
      albumin. However, body composition analysis demonstrated a decrease in body cell 
      mass (BCM) in patients with CD (23.1 kg, 20.8-28.7, P = 0.021) and UC (22.6 kg,
      21.0-28.0, P = 0.041) compared with controls (25.0 kg, 22.0-32.5). Handgrip
      strength correlated with BCM (r = 0.703, P = 0.001) and was decreased in patients
      with CD (32.8 kg, 26.0-41.1, P = 0.005) and UC (31.0 kg, 27.3-37.8, P = 0.001)
      compared with controls (36.0 kg, 31.0-52.0). The alterations were seen even in
      patients classified as well nourished. BCM was lower in patients with moderately 
      increased serum C-reactive protein levels compared with patients with normal
      levels. CONCLUSION: In CD and UC, selected micronutrient deficits and loss of BCM
      and muscle strength are frequent in remission and cannot be detected by standard 
      malnutrition screening.

TI  - Omega-3 fatty acids exacerbate DSS-induced colitis through decreased adiponectin 
      in colonic subepithelial myofibroblasts.
PG  - 1348-57
LID - 10.1002/ibd.20491 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the immunoregulatory effects of omega-3 fatty acid and
      adiponectin have been postulated, their role in intestinal inflammation is
      controversial. The aim of this study was to determine whether dietary fat intake 
      influences activity of colonic inflammation through modulating this system.
      METHODS: C57BL/6 mice received dextran sulfate sodium for induction of colitis.
      Mice were fed a control diet, omega-3 fat-rich diet, omega-6 fat-rich diet, or
      saturated fat-rich diet. Some mice were administered a peroxisome proliferator
      activated receptor-gamma; agonist, pioglitazone. Messenger RNA expression of
      adiponectin and its receptors were analyzed. Adiponectin expression in colonic
      mucosa of ulcerative colitis patients was also analyzed. RESULTS: The receptors
      for adiponectin were found to be ubiquitously expressed in epithelial cells,
      intraepithelial lymphocytes, lamina proprial mononuclear cells, and subepithelial
      myofibroblasts from colonic tissue, but adiponectin was only expressed in
      myofibroblasts. Induction of colitis significantly decreased the expression of
      adiponectin in colonic mucosa. The omega-3 fat diet group, but not the other fat 
      diet groups, showed exacerbated colitis with a further decrease of adiponectin
      expression. Pioglitazone treatment ameliorated the level of decrease in
      adiponectin expression and improved colonic inflammation induced by the omega-3
      fat-rich diet. In patients with ulcerative colitis, the expression level of
      adiponectin in colonic mucosa was also decreased compared with that in control
      mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: Adiponectin was found to be expressed in myofibroblasts.
      Adiponectin expression was significantly suppressed by induction of colitis, and 
      aggravation of colitis after exposure to omega-3 fat may be due to a further
      decrease in the expression level of adiponectin.

LID - 10.1099/jmm.0.47476-0 [doi]
AB  - In order to assess the lethality of Clostridium difficile-associated disease
      (CDAD) and the PCR ribotypes prevalent in Austria, the Austrian Agency for Health
      and Food Safety requested isolates of C. difficile from patients in a structured 
      but arbitrary sampling scheme. In the allocated period from February 2006 to
      January 2007, local hospital laboratories within each of the nine provinces were 
      asked to submit C. difficile isolates from at least ten cases of CDAD.
      Confirmation of species identification, toxin detection, susceptibility testing
      against four antimicrobial agents and typing using a PCR ribotyping method were
      performed at the reference laboratory. In total, 149 isolates of putative C.
      difficile were submitted, from which 142 were included for study. Antimicrobial
      susceptibility patterns revealed resistance to clindamycin in 57% and high-level 
      resistance to moxifloxacin in 38% of isolates tested. CDAD manifested as
      diarrhoea (including eight cases of bloody diarrhoea) in 126 cases (88.7%), as
      pseudomembranous colitis in 15 cases (10.6%) and as toxic megacolon in one case. 
      Twelve of the 142 patients died within 30 days of specimen collection (8.45%
      lethality). A lethal outcome occurred in 2/15 cases (13.3%) when pseudomembranous
      colitis was present and in 10/126 cases (7.9%) in the absence of pseudomembranous
      colitis or toxic megacolon. Among the 142 isolates from 25 health-care
      facilities, 41 PCR ribotype patterns were found. The most frequent ribotypes were
      AI-5 (including six lethal cases out of 26 patients), 014 (two out of 24) and 053
      (one out of 24). The typing patterns demonstrated the occurrence of clusters in
      hospitals.

AB  - Apart from genetic and environmental factors, the mucosal immune system of the
      gut plays a central role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
      In the healthy gut, the mucosal immune system ensures the balance between pro-
      and anti-inflammatory mediators and thereby allows an effective defence against
      luminal pathogens but at the same time prevents an overwhelming immune reaction
      directed against the huge amount of harmless luminal antigens (for example,
      components of food or nonpathological bacteria). In both entities of IBD (Crohn's
      disease and ulcerative colitis) this immunological balance is severely impaired
      and shifted towards the pro-inflammatory side. The chronic mucosal inflammation
      in IBD is caused by hyperactivation of effector immune cells, which produce high 
      levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines like tumour necrosis factor-alpha,
      interleukin-6 and interferon-gamma, resulting in colonic tissue damage. The
      nuclear transcription factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) was identified as one of the key 
      regulators in this immunological setting. Its activation is markedly induced in
      IBD patients and through its ability to promote the expression of various
      pro-inflammatory genes, NF-kappaB strongly influences the course of mucosal
      inflammation. Considering the different cell-type specific effects which are
      mediated by NF-kappaB, this review aims at describing the complex role of
      NF-kappaB in IBD and discusses existing pharmacological attempts to block the
      activation of NF-kappaB to develop new therapeutic strategies in IBD.

TI  - Carrageenan-induced NFkappaB activation depends on distinct pathways mediated by 
      reactive oxygen species and Hsp27 or by Bcl10.
PG  - 973-82
LID - 10.1016/j.bbagen.2008.03.019 [doi]
AB  - Carrageenans are highly sulfated polysaccharides that are widely used as food
      additives due to their ability to improve food texture. They are also widely
      recognized for their ability to induce inflammation in animal models of colitis. 
      Recently, we reported that carrageenan (CGN) activated a pathway of innate
      immunity in human colonic epithelial cells mediated by Bcl10 (B-cell CLL/lymphoma
      10). However, increases in phospho-IkappaBalpha and Interleukin-8 (IL-8) were not
      completely inhibited by silencing Bcl10, suggesting that CGN also influenced
      another mechanism, or mechanisms, of inflammation. In this report, we demonstrate
      that CGN increases production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in human colonic
      epithelial cells. The combination of ROS quenching by the free radical scavenger 
      Tempol and of Bcl10 silencing by siRNA completely inhibited the CGN-induced
      increases in nuclear NFkappaB (p65), phospho-IkappaBalpha, and secretion of IL-8.
      The CGN-induced increase in ROS was associated with declines in phosphorylation
      of MAPK 12 (p38gamma), MAPK 13 (p38delta), and heat-shock protein (Hsp) 27. The
      CGN-induced decline in phospho-Hsp27 was reversed by co-administration of Tempol 
      (100 nM), but unaffected by silencing Bcl10. Since Hsp27 phosphorylation is
      inversely associated with phosphorylation of the IkappaBalpha kinase (IKK)
      signalosome, CGN exposure appears to affect the IKK signalosome by both the
      catalytic component, mediated by ROS-phospho-Hsp27, and the regulatory component,
      mediated by Bcl10 interaction with IKKgamma (Nemo). Hence, the CGN-activated
      inflammatory cascades related to innate immunity and to generation of ROS may be 
      integrated at the level of the IKK signalosome.

TI  - Clostridium difficile in broiler chickens sold at market places in Zimbabwe and
      their antimicrobial susceptibility.
PG  - 268-70
LID - 10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2008.03.020 [doi]
AB  - Clostridium difficile has been shown to be a nosocomial pathogen associated with 
      diarrhoea and pseudomembranous colitis in hospitalised patients and the infection
      is believed to be acquired nosocomially. Community-acquired C.
      difficile-associated diarrhoea has also been reported. Recent studies have shown 
      the occurrence of C. difficile in food animals which may act as a source of
      infection to humans. The aim of this study was to determine the occurrence of C. 
      difficile in broiler chickens sold at market places in an urban area in Zimbabwe.
      Faeces of broiler chickens were collected from the cages at the market places and
      soils were collected from areas around the market places. The chicken faeces and 
      soil samples were cultured for C. difficile. The C. difficile isolates were
      tested for toxins A or B production as well as for their susceptibility to
      antimicrobial drugs. C. difficile was isolated from 29.0% of 100 chicken faeces
      samples and 22.0% of 100 soil samples. Some of the C. difficile isolates from
      chickens (89.7%) and soils (95.5%) were toxigenic. All the isolates were
      susceptible to metronidazole, vancomycin, doxycycline, chloramphenicol and
      tetracycline. Over 70% of the isolates were susceptible to erythromycin,
      co-trimoxazole and ampicillin. They were all resistant to cefotaxime, gentamicin,
      ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and nalidixic acid. The results of the present study
      suggest that broiler chickens sold at market places in the urban area are an
      important source of C. difficile, which may infect humans through consumption of 
      chicken meat.

TI  - Impact of lactose containing foods and the genetics of lactase on diseases: an
      analytical review of population data.
PG  - 292-300
LID - 10.1080/01635580701745301 [doi]
AB  - Dairy foods (DFs) contain complex ingredients that could affect different
      diseases. The control of lactose digestion phenotypically divides populations
      into those who can [lactase persistent (LP)] and those who cannot [lactase
      nonpersistent (LNP)] assimilate lactose. LNP subjects, however, can adapt to
      lactose intolerance through intestinal bacteria. The DF/LNP status interactions
      may function as disease risk modifiers. We evaluated the relationship between DF 
      and LNP with colorectal, breast, prostate, ovarian, lung, and stomach cancer and 
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD; Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis). Yearly
      per capita DF consumption, LNP national prevalence, cancer mortality, and
      incidence of IBD were obtained from several sources. A negative binomial
      regression model was used to derive incremental risks. There were statistically
      significant (P <or= 0.05) increases in risk for colorectal and prostate cancer
      and ulcerative colitis with DFs and a statistically significant decreased risk
      for stomach cancer. There were trends (P<0.1) for lung and ovarian cancers and
      Crohn's disease. As LNP prevalence increased, stomach cancer risk increased,
      whereas risks of all other conditions decreased (P<0.01). In 3 cancers (prostate,
      ovarian, and breast), meta-analyses of case-based studies support ecological
      data. In colorectal cancer, on the contrary, meta-analyses of case-based studies 
      suggest protection. The possible importance of distinguishing LNP/LP status in
      studies is discussed.

TI  - Anti-inflammatory activity of probiotic Bifidobacterium: enhancement of IL-10
      production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from ulcerative colitis patients
      and inhibition of IL-8 secretion in HT-29 cells.
PG  - 2511-6
AB  - AIM: To determine the anti-inflammatory activity of probiotic Bifidobacteria in
      Bifidobacteria-fermented milk (BFM) which is effective against active ulcerative 
      colitis (UC) and exacerbations of UC, and to explore the immunoregulatory
      mechanisms. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) from UC patients 
      or HT-29 cells were co-cultured with heat-killed probiotic bacteria or culture
      supernatant of Bifidobacterium breve strain Yakult (BbrY) or Bifidobacterium
      bifidum strain Yakult (BbiY) to estimate the amount of IL-10 or IL-8 secreted.
      RESULTS: Both strains of probiotic Bifidobacteria contained in the BFM induced
      IL-10 production in PBMNC from UC patients, though BbrY was more effective than
      BbiY. Conditioned medium (CM) and DNA of both strains inhibited IL-8 secretion in
      HT-29 cells stimulated with TNF-alpha, whereas no such effect was observed with
      heat-killed bacteria. The inhibitory effect of CM derived from BbiY was greater
      than that of CM derived from BbrY. DNAs of the two strains had a comparable
      inhibitory activity against the secretion of IL-8. CM of BbiY induced a
      repression of IL-8 gene expression with a higher expression of IkappaB-zeta mRNA 
      4 h after culture of HT-29 cells compared to that in the absence of CM.
      CONCLUSION: Probiotic Bifidobacterium strains in BFM enhance IL-10 production in 
      PBMNC and inhibit IL-8 secretion in intestinal epithelial cells, suggesting that 
      BFM has anti-inflammatory effects against ulcerative colitis.

TI  - State and trait anxiety and depression in patients affected by gastrointestinal
      diseases: psychometric evaluation of 1641 patients referred to an internal
      medicine outpatient setting.
PG  - 1063-9
LID - 10.1111/j.1742-1241.2008.01763.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate state and trait form of anxiety and current depression in
      patients affected by gastrointestinal diseases. METHODS: We studied 1641
      outpatients with gastrointestinal disorders, consecutively referred to our
      Internal Medicine outpatients from 1997 to 2005. State and trait anxiety were
      assessed by the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory. Current depression was
      assessed by the Zung self-rating depression scale. RESULTS: Among patients, 1379 
      (84.1%) showed state anxiety, 1098 (67%) showed trait anxiety and 442 (27%)
      showed current depression. The number of gastrointestinal diseases was directly
      correlated to state anxiety (p < 0.001) and trait anxiety (p = 0.04). Females
      showed higher levels of anxiety and depression than males (p < 0.001). State
      anxiety was related to food allergies (p < 0.001), small intestinal bacterial
      overgrowth (SIBO) (p = 0.001), Hp infection (p = 0.01) and ulcerative colitis in 
      active phase (p = 0.03). Trait anxiety was related to irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS) (p < 0.001), Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection (p = 0.001), food allergies
      (p = 0.001) and SIBO (p = 0.001). Current depression was related to IBS (p <
      0.001) and coeliac disease (p = 0.01), SIBO (p = 0.02). A predicted probability
      of 0.77 +/- 0.16 to have state anxiety, of 0.66 +/- 0.12 to have trait anxiety
      and of 0.39 +/- 0.14 to have depression was found in these patients. CONCLUSIONS:
      Most of the patients who seek medical consultation for gastrointestinal problems 
      show an associated affective disorder. These patients should be managed by a team
      including gastroenterologists, psychologists and/or psychiatrists, or by a
      gastroenterologist having expertise in the treatment of psychological disorders.

TI  - Role of probiotic therapy in IBD.
PG  - 1597-605
LID - 10.1002/ibd.20465 [doi]
AB  - There is mounting evidence that probiotic therapy may alter disease expression in
      both animal models of IBD and in patients with IBD. The effects appear to be
      modest at best and may reflect the choice of probiotic organism, the variability 
      in concentrations of organisms administered, and the variability of the diseases 
      being treated. This review examines the data of all fully published articles
      currently available for the role of probiotics in the treatment of IBD.

AB  - The same drugs are used to treat hemorrhagic rectocolitis (HRC) and Crohn's
      disease (CD), although the aims are very different. Aminosalicylates are highly
      beneficial in HRC but virtually ineffective in CD, a disease in which
      immunosuppressants are more useful. Aminosalicylates exert their antiinflammatory
      effect directly on the lesions. Various oral and rectal preparations have been
      developed in order to deliver the active molecule to the intestinal target
      segment. These drugs are now known to act by stimulating the nuclear receptor
      PPAR-gamma, and this knowledge should help with the development of new agents.
      Chronic aminosalicylate treatment appears to diminish the risk of malignant
      transformation. Systemic steroids are still the mainstay of treatment for
      exacerbations of HRC and CD, yielding remissions in 60 to 90% of cases. In
      contrast, systemic steroids should not be used for maintenance therapy.
      Budesonide is a preparation that selectively releases steroids in the ileocolonic
      region, thereby reducing systemic adverse effects. Immunosuppressants such as
      azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine, and also methotrexate in some cases, are used 
      for maintenance therapy of steroid-dependent and highly recurrent forms. These
      drugs stabilize the disease in about half the patients who receive them.
      Treatment typically lasts several years and necessitates regular monitoring,
      especially of hematological status. Cyclosporine is used intravenously in severe 
      HRC. Infliximab (RemicadeR), a chimeric monoclonal antibody targeting TNF is
      effective in acute forms and as maintenance therapy for CD. It was also recently 
      shown to be effective in HRC. Infliximab is indicated in steroid-resistant forms 
      and contraindicated in patients with latent systemic infections (tuberculosis,
      hepatitis B) and heart failure. Artificial nutrition is now only used in children
      with acute forms, in order to avoid the need for steroids. Probiotics might have 
      a place in maintenance treatment of HRC. Surgical treatment of HRC consists of
      colectomy or, more radically, ileoprotectomy followed by ileoanal anastomosis
      with resection: however, the likely benefits and potential complications
      (especially nocturnal diarrhea) must be carefully weighed up. Surgical treatment 
      of CD consists of resecting the worst-affected segments. As available medical and
      surgical treatments can only control these diseases, without curing them, patient
      management must be planned on a long-term basis. Control of exacerbations is
      judged on the basis of clinical parameters and biological markers of
      inflammation, rather than on lesion healing. The choice of maintenance therapy
      depends on the nature of the disease (HRC or CD) and its progressive nature.
      Surgery is reserved for patients with complicated and drug-resistant forms.

      detrimental composition in ulcerative colitis patients and non-ulcerative colitis
      subjects.

AB  - AIM: To investigate the effect of native, heated and glycated bovine serum
      albumin (BSA) on the ulcerative colitis (UC) and non-UC colonic microbiota in
      vitro. METHODS AND RESULTS: Continuous flow culture (CFC) models of the human
      colonic microbiota inoculated with faeces from UC and non-UC volunteers were
      maintained on BSA as growth substrate. Changes in bacterial populations and
      short-chain fatty acids were determined. UC and non-UC microbiota differed
      significantly in microbial populations, with elevated numbers of sulfate-reducing
      bacteria (SRB) and clostridia in the microbiota from UC patients. Compared with
      native BSA, glycated BSA modulated the gut microbiota of UC patients in vitro
      towards a more detrimental community structure with significant increases in
      putatively harmful bacteria (clostridia, bacteroides and SRB; P < 0.009) and
      decreases in dominant and putatively beneficial bacterial groups (eubacteria and 
      bifidobacteria; P < 0.0004). The levels of beneficial short-chain fatty acids
      were significantly decreased by heated or glycated BSA, but were increased
      significantly by native BSA. CONCLUSION: The UC colonic microbiota maintained in 
      CFC was significantly modified by glycated BSA. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE
      STUDY: Results suggest that dietary glycated protein may impact upon the
      composition and activity of the colonic microbiota, an important environmental
      variable in UC.

      patients with inflammatory bowel disease?
PG  - 906-12
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.200700147 [doi]
AB  - The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves an interaction
      between genetically determined host susceptibility, dysregulated immune response,
      and the enteric microbiota. Ecological treatments including probiotics,
      prebiotics, and synbiotics are actively studied in Crohn's disease (CD),
      ulcerative colitis (UC) and pouchitis. We review herein the literature on the
      rational use of probiotics in IBD considering efficacy (as evaluated in
      randomized controlled trials), mechanisms of action and safety issues. A
      probiotic effect is strictly restricted to one defined strain and cannot be
      generalized from one to another. There is evidence of efficacy of some probiotic 
      drugs in pouchitis (VSL#3), and in the prevention of recurrence of UC
      (Escherichia coli Nissle 1917). However, the evidence for efficacy of probiotic
      drugs in CD is still low as well as that of dietary ecological treatments.
      Despite an ecological (hopefully nutritional) treatment of IBD is promising, many
      questions remain unanswered and further clinical and fundamental studies are
      needed.

AB  - The normal colonic microflora is intimately involved in the aetiology of
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's
      disease (CD). These conditions are often refractile to conventional treatments
      involving the employment of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant drugs, and
      this has led to a search for alternative therapies based on the use of
      probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics. The majority of investigations in this
      area have been done with probiotics, and while there is increasing interest in
      the abilities of prebiotics and synbiotics to control the symptoms of IBD, very
      few randomised controlled trials have been reported. Although the results have
      been variable, human and animal studies have demonstrated that in many
      circumstances, these functional foods can alter the composition of the colonic
      microbiota, reduce inflammatory processes in the gut mucosa, and have the
      potential to induce disease remission. More work is needed to understand the
      effects of prebiotics and synbiotics on microbial communities in the gut, and
      their interactions with the host's immune system.

      disease.
PG  - 855-66
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.200700050 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by anorexia, malnutrition,
      altered body composition, and development of mesenteric white adipose tissue
      (WAT) hypertrophy. Increasing evidence suggests that adipokines synthesized
      either in WAT or in immune cells, are involved in these manifestations of IBD.
      Among adipokines leptin, adiponectin and resistin hold a fundamental role while
      the role of ghrelin in inflammation is not well established. Preliminary studies 
      have shown overexpression of leptin, adiponectin, and resistin in mesenteric WAT 
      of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and significant alterations of circulating 
      serum levels of these adipokines in IBD. It has also been demonstrated that
      intestinal inflammation causes an increase in endogenous ghrelin production. In
      animal models of intestinal inflammation, existing data suggest that leptin,
      adiponectin, and resistin are pivotal mediators of inflammation. Interesting
      therapeutic interventions based on these data have been suggested. A specific
      role for hypertrophic WAT has also been implicated in CD. Further efforts with
      experimental and clinical studies are needed to better understand the role of
      adipokines in IBD.

TI  - Microbial host interactions in IBD: implications for pathogenesis and therapy.
PG  - 497-507
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and pouchitis appear to be caused 
      by pathogenic T-cell responses to discrete antigens from the complex luminal
      microbiota, with susceptibility conferred by genetic polymorphisms that regulate 
      bacterial killing, mucosal barrier function, or immune responses. Environmental
      triggers initiate or reactivate inflammation and modulate genetic susceptibility.
      New pathogenesis concepts include defective bacterial killing by innate immune
      cells in CD, colonization of the ileum in CD with functionally abnormal
      Escherichia coli that adhere to and invade epithelial cells and resist bacterial 
      killing, and alterations in enteric microbiota composition in CD, UC, and
      pouchitis detected by molecular probes. The considerable therapeutic potential of
      manipulating the enteric microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease patients has
      not been realized, probably due to failure to recognize heterogenic disease
      mechanisms that require individualized use of antibiotics, probiotics,
      prebiotics, combination therapies, and genetically engineered bacteria to restore
      mucosal homeostasis.

AB  - Adipocytokines are a group of adipocyte-secreted proteins that have significant
      effects on the metabolism of lipids and carbohydrates, as well as numerous other 
      processes. A number of recent studies have indicated that some adipocytokines may
      significantly influence the proliferation of malignant cells in vitro, whereas it
      remains unclear whether they have similar roles in vivo. In this study, we
      determined serum levels of adipocytokines in mice with azoxymethane (AOM)- and
      dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colon carcinogenesis. Five-week-old ICR mice
      were given a single intraperitoneal injection of AOM followed by 1% DSS in
      drinking water for 7 days. Nobiletin (NOB), a citrus flavonoid, was given in the 
      diet (100 p.p.m) for 17 weeks. Thereafter, the incidence and number of colon
      tumors and serum concentration of adipocytokines were determined at the end of
      week 20. The serum leptin level in AOM/DSS-treated mice was six times higher than
      that in untreated mice, whereas there were no significant differences in the
      levels of triglycerides, adiponectin and interleukin-6. Feeding with NOB
      abolished colonic malignancy and notably decreased the serum leptin level by 75%.
      Further, NOB suppressed the leptin-dependent, but not independent, proliferation 
      of HT-29 colon cancer cells and decreased leptin secretion through inactivation
      of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signaling-regulated protein
      kinase, but not that of adiponectin in differentiated 3T3-L1 mouse adipocytes in 
      a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, our results suggest that higher levels
      of leptin in serum promote colon carcinogenesis in mice, whereas NOB has
      chemopreventive effects against colon carcinogenesis, partly through regulation
      of leptin levels.

TI  - Melatonin and serotonin effects on gastrointestinal motility.
PG  - 97-103
AB  - The gastrointestinal tract represents the most important extra pineal source of
      melatonin. Presence of melatonin (M) suggests that this hormone is somehow
      involved in digestive pathophysiology. Release of GI melatonin from
      serotonin-rich enterochromaffin EC cells of the GI mucosa suggest close
      antagonistic relationship with serotonin (S) and seem to be related to
      periodicity of food intake. Food deprivation resulted in an increase of tissue
      and plasma concentrations of M. Its also act as an autocrine and paracrine
      hormone affecting not only epithelium and immune system but also smooth muscle of
      the digestive tract. Low doses M improve gastrointestinal transit and affect MMC.
      M reinforce MMCs cyclic pattern but inhibits spiking bowel activity.
      Pharmacological doses of M delay gastric emptying via mechanisms that involve
      CCK2 and 5HT3 receptors. M released in response to lipid infusion exerts a
      modulatory influence that decreases the inhibitory effects of the ileal brake on 
      gastric emptying. On isolated bowel S induces dose dependent increase in tone and
      reduction in amplitude of contraction which is affected by M. M reduced the tone 
      but not amplitude or frequency of contraction. M is a promising therapeutic agent
      for IBS with activities independent of its effects on sleep, anxiety or
      depression. Since of its unique properties M could be considered for prevention
      or treatment of colorectal cancer, ulcerative colitis, gastric ulcers and
      irritable bowel syndrome.

TI  - Refeeding syndrome: a potentially fatal condition but remains underdiagnosed and 
      undertreated.
PG  - 604-6
LID - 10.1016/j.nut.2008.01.053 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe two cases of successfully prevented refeeding syndrome in 
      a high-risk group of patients. METHODS: Case 1 was a 70-y-old woman who presented
      with a 4-mo history of poor dietary intake and ill health due to a connective
      tissue disease leading to myositis and dysphagia and complicated by respiratory
      failure needing mechanical ventilation. Twelve hours after starting nasogastric
      tube feeding, she developed a cardiac arrest from which she was successfully
      resuscitated. Repeated attempts to wean her from the ventilator failed. Case 2
      was a 15-y-old girl who was readmitted after a total colectomy for severe
      ulcerative colitis with diarrhea and vomiting leading to significant weight loss.
      Her body mass index was 11.4 kg/m(2). RESULTS: In case 1, after consultation by
      the clinical nutrition team, the diagnosis of refeeding syndrome was made and the
      patient was duly started on a high-protein, high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet,
      multivitamin and trace-element supplements, and electrolyte infusion.
      Subsequently she was successfully weaned from the ventilator. In case 2, further 
      investigation by the clinical nutrition team revealed low baseline electrolyte
      concentrations including potassium, magnesium, calcium, and phosphate and low
      serum albumin. Her low body mass index and baseline electrolyte concentrations
      put her at high risk of developing refeeding syndrome. She was initially started 
      on low-calorie feeding, multivitamin and minerals, and her electrolytes were
      carefully monitored. She made a good recovery. CONCLUSION: Refeeding syndrome is 
      a life-threatening, underdiagnosed, treatable condition but there is a need for a
      wider awareness of the condition among health professionals.

TI  - VSL#3 probiotic upregulates intestinal mucosal alkaline sphingomyelinase and
      reduces inflammation.
PG  - 237-42
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alkaline sphingomyelinase, an enzyme found exclusively in bile and
      the intestinal brush border, hydrolyzes sphingomyelin into ceramide, sphingosine 
      and sphingosine-1-phosphate, thereby inducing epithelial apoptosis. Reduced
      levels of alkaline sphingomyelinase have been found in premalignant and malignant
      intestinal epithelia and in ulcerative colitis tissue. Probiotic bacteria can be 
      a source of sphingomyelinase. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of VSL#3
      probiotic therapy on mucosal levels of alkaline sphingomyelinase, both in a mouse
      model of colitis and in patients with ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Interleukin-10
      gene-deficient (IL10KO) and wild type control mice were treated with VSL#3 (10(9)
      colony-forming units per day) for three weeks, after which alkaline
      sphingomyelinase activity was measured in ileal and colonic tissue. As well, 15
      patients with ulcerative colitis were treated with VSL#3 (900 billion bacteria
      two times per day for five weeks). Alkaline sphingomyelinase activity was
      measured through biopsies and comparison of ulcerative colitis disease activity
      index scores obtained before and after treatment. RESULTS: Lowered alkaline
      sphingomyelinase levels were seen in the colon (P=0.02) and ileum (P=0.04) of
      IL10KO mice, as compared with controls. Treatment of these mice with VSL#3
      resulted in upregulation of mucosal alkaline sphingomyelinase activity in both
      the colon (P=0.04) and the ileum (P=0.01). VSL#3 treatment of human patients who 
      had ulcerative colitis decreased mean (+/- SEM) ulcerative colitis disease
      activity index scores from 5.3+/-1.8946 to 0.70+/-0.34 (P=0.02) and increased
      mucosal alkaline sphingomyelinase activity. CONCLUSION: Mucosal alkaline
      sphingomyelinase activity is reduced in the intestine of IL10KO mice with colitis
      and in humans with ulcerative colitis. VSL#3 probiotic therapy upregulates
      mucosal alkaline sphingomyelinase activity.

TI  - The effect of probiotics and organic acids on Shiga-toxin 2 gene expression in
      enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.
PG  - 125-32
LID - 10.1016/j.mimet.2008.01.014 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics are known to have an inhibitory effect against the growth of various
      foodborne pathogens, however, the specific role of probiotics in
      Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) virulence gene expression has not
      been well defined. Shiga toxins are members of a family of highly potent
      bacterial toxins and are the main virulence marker for STEC. Shiga toxins inhibit
      protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells and play a role in hemorrhagic colitis and 
      hemolytic uremic syndrome. STEC possesses Shiga toxin 1 (Stx1) and Shiga toxin 2 
      (Stx2), both of which have A and B subunits. Although STEC containing both Stx1
      and Stx2 has been isolated from patients with hemorrhagic colitis, Stx2 is more
      frequently associated with human disease complications. Thus, the effect of
      Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, and Bifidobacterium strains on stx2A expression
      levels in STEC was investigated. Lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria were
      isolated from farm animals, dairy, and human sources and included L. rhamnosus
      GG, L. curvatus, L. plantarum, L. jensenii, L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. reuteri,
      P. acidilactici, P. cerevisiae, P. pentosaceus, B. thermophilum, B. boum, B. suis
      and B. animalis. E. coli O157:H7 (EDL 933) was coincubated with sub-lethal
      concentrations of each probiotic strain. Following RNA extraction and cDNA
      synthesis, relative stx2A mRNA levels were determined according to a comparative 
      critical threshold (Ct) real-time PCR. Data were normalized to the endogenous
      control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and the level of stx2A
      expression between treated and untreated STEC was compared. Observed for all
      probiotic strains tested, stx2A was down-regulated, when compared to the control 
      culture. Probiotic production of organic acids, as demonstrated by a decrease in 
      pH, influenced stx2A gene expression.

AB  - In approximately one-fourth of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative 
      colitis (UC), disease onset occurs during childhood and adolescence. In addition 
      to gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD), children with these conditions often experience one or more nutritional
      complications of their disease including growth failure, delayed puberty,
      osteoporosis, anemia, and micronutrient deficiencies. This article provides an
      overview of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of
      selected nutritional complications in pediatric IBD.

AB  - Escherichia coli colonizes the human gastrointestinal tract and produces a
      variety of diseases. Escherichia coli O157 is one of the most important
      pathogenic strains reported from food-borne illnesses leading to
      enterohemorrhagic colitis. The National Salmonella and Escherichia Centre is a
      national reference centre for Salmonella and Escherichia for India; it receives
      samples from research laboratories, hospitals and institutions for serological
      identification. The present study is an epidemiological survey of E. coli O157 in
      different regions of India. The data are based on samples received from humans,
      food items, animals and the environment. A total of 17 093 isolates cultured from
      samples were received during the 10-year period of which 5678 were from human
      sources. Thirty (0.5%) human samples were positive for E. coli O157. A
      significantly high percentage of E. coli O157 were isolated from meat (0.9%,
      13/1376), milk and milk products (1.8%, 10/553), seafood (8.4%, 16/190) and water
      (1.6%, 8/486). The isolates were found to be distributed among domestic and wild 
      animals, and the maximum number of isolates of E. coli O157 was detected in
      samples received from coastal belt areas. Escherichia coli O157 is widely
      distributed among humans and animals, food and environment in different
      geographical regions of India.

TI  - Probiotics: sorting the evidence from the myths.
PG  - 304-8
AB  - Probiotics consist of yeast or bacteria, especially lactic acid bacteria. They
      are available as capsules, powder, fermented milks or yoghurts. Probiotics
      exhibit strain-specific differences in their resistance to acid and bile, ability
      to colonise the gastrointestinal tract, clinical efficacy, and benefits to the
      health of the host. There is level I evidence for the use of probiotics in
      treating acute infectious diarrhoea and preventing antibiotic-associated
      diarrhoea, with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Saccharomyces boulardii having the
      most evidence to support their use for these conditions. There is level II
      evidence that S. boulardii combined with high-dose vancomycin is more effective
      than the antibiotic alone in preventing recurrent Clostridium difficile
      diarrhoea. There is level I evidence that probiotics prevent traveller's
      diarrhoea. There is level I evidence for use of the high-potency probiotic VSL#3 
      in preventing pouchitis, and level II evidence for this agent in preventing
      relapse in patients with ulcerative colitis. Probiotics are generally regarded as
      safe and well tolerated. Some probiotics may be contraindicated in patients who
      are immunocompromised or have severe underlying illness, as they have been
      reported to cause fungaemia and bacteraemia.

TI  - In vitro and in vivo effects of the probiotic Escherichia coli strain M-17:
      immunomodulation and attenuation of murine colitis.
PG  - 530-41
LID - 10.1017/S0007114508930373 [doi]
AB  - We examined the in vitro and in vivo effects of a probiotic, Escherichia coli
      strain M-17 (EC-M17), on NF-kappaB signalling, cytokine secretion and efficacy in
      dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced murine colitis. NF-kappaB signalling was
      assessed using an NF-kappaB luciferase reporter cell line that was stimulated
      with TNF-alpha (100 ng/ml). p65 Nuclear binding and cytokine secretion
      (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6) were evaluated using a RAW 264.7 macrophage cell
      line that was exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 5 microg/ml). Mice were
      administered vehicle, EC-M17, metronidazole, or EC-M17 plus metronidazole for 13 
      d. During the final 6 d, mice also received 2 % DSS. Parameters evaluated
      included disease activity index (DAI), histology, myeloperoxidase and NF-kappaB
      p65. EC-M17 dose dependently inhibited TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB signalling. At
      5 x 109 colony-forming units/ml, EC-M17 inhibited NF-kappaB by >95 %. LPS-induced
      nuclear p65 binding was significantly inhibited (78 %; P 90 %) the LPS-induced
      secretion of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6. In mice with DSS-induced colitis,
      EC-M17, metronidazole, and EC-M17 plus metronidazole significantly reduced DAI
      and colonic histology scores. Both EC-M17 and metronidazole reduced colonic
      IL-12, IL-6, IL-1beta and interferon-gamma. The combination of EC-M17 plus
      metronidazole resulted in more substantial cytokine reductions than were found
      with either treatment alone, and combination therapy significantly (P < 0.05 in
      both cases) reduced IL-1beta compared with EC-M17 and colonic histology scores
      compared with metronidazole. Alone, and in combination with metronidazole, EC-M17
      improved murine colitis, probably due to an inhibitory effect on NF-kappaB
      signalling.

AB  - The intestinal microflora is a large bacterial community that colonizes the gut, 
      with a metabolic activity equal to an organ and various functions that affect the
      physiology and pathology of the host's mucosal immune system. Intestinal bacteria
      are useful in promotion of human health, but certain components of microflora, in
      genetically susceptible individuals, contribute to various pathological
      disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease. Clinical and experimental
      observations indicate an imbalance in protective and harmful microflora
      components in these disorders. Manipulation of gut flora to enhance its
      protective and beneficial role represents a promising field of new therapeutic
      strategies of inflammatory bowel disease. In this review, we discuss the
      implication of gut flora in the intestinal inflammation that justifies the role
      of probiotics and prebiotics in the prevention and treatment of inflammatory
      bowel disease and we address the evidence for therapeutic benefits from their use
      in experimental models of colitis and clinical trials.

PG  - 98-107

AB  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is a water- and food-borne pathogen
      that causes hemorrhagic colitis. EHEC uses a type III secretion system (T3SS) to 
      translocate effector proteins that subvert host cell function. T3SS-substrates
      encoded outside of the locus of enterocyte effacement are important to E. coli
      pathogenesis. We discovered an EHEC secreted protein, NleF, encoded by z6020 in
      O-island 71 of E. coli EDL933 that we hypothesized to be a T3SS substrate.
      Experiments are presented that probe the function of NleF and its role in
      virulence. Immunoblotting of secreted and translocated proteins suggest that NleF
      is secreted by the T3SS and is translocated into host cells in vitro where it
      localizes to the host cytoplasm. Infection of HeLa cells with E. coli possessing 
      or lacking nleF and transient expression of NleF-GFP via transfection did not
      reveal a significant role for NleF in several assays of bacterial adherence, host
      cytoskeletal remodeling, or host protein secretion. However, competitive
      coinfection of mice with Citrobacter rodentium strains possessing or lacking nleF
      suggested a contribution of NleF to bacterial colonization. Challenge of
      gnotobiotic piglets also revealed a role for NleF in colonization of the piglet
      colon and rectoanal junction.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intestinal microflora contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory 
      bowel disease, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. OBJECTIVE: This 
      review summarizes current clinical knowledge about the role of intestinal
      microflora in inflammatory bowel disease and their importance as targets for new 
      forms of therapy. METHODS: Recent knowledge on gut microbial ecology, role of
      microflora, and pattern recognition receptors is summarized in relation to
      inflammatory bowel disease. The results of in vitro experiments, in vivo animal
      studies and human clinical trials with the use of agents targeting microflora,
      including prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics, are described briefly.
      CONCLUSION: Altering the composition of intestinal microflora through prebiotics,
      probiotics and synbiotics may improve the clinical outcome of patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease.

      IBD/FBD Specialized Trials register were searched to locate all published reports
      from 1966 to 2007. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized, prospective studies using
      probiotics alone or in conjunction with conventional antibiotics for the
      treatment of documented C. difficile colitis were eligible for inclusion. DATA
      COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data extraction and analysis was done independently by
      two authors. MAIN RESULTS: Four studies met the inclusion criteria and were
      included in the review. The four studies examined the use of probiotics in
      conjunction with conventional antibiotics (vancomycin or metronidazole) for the
      treatment of recurrence or an initial episode of C. difficile colitis in adults. 
      The studies were small in size and had methodological problems. A statistically
      significant benefit for probiotics combined with antibiotics was found in one
      study. McFarland 1994 found that patients receiving S. boulardii were
      significantly less likely than patients receiving placebo to experience
      recurrence of C. difficile diarrhea (RR 0.59; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.98). No benefit of
      probiotics treatment was found in the other studies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There 
      is insufficient evidence to recommend probiotic therapy as an adjunct to
      antibiotic therapy for C. difficile colitis. There is no evidence to support the 
      use of probiotics alone in the treatment of C. difficile colitis.

TI  - Dietary lipids in early development and intestinal inflammatory disease.
PG  - S188-93
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases are life-long reoccurring inflammatory disorders of
      the gastrointestinal tract and have been increasing in incidence in recent
      decades, notably in the pediatric population. Although genetic predisposition
      remains an important factor, this increased incidence most likely reflects an
      environmental change. One potential contributor to this is the change in dietary 
      fat intake, with dietary intake of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)
      following a similar temporal pattern to the change in inflammatory bowel disease 
      incidence. Dietary n-6 PUFAs comprise a major, modifiable, environmental factor
      known to promote a heightened inflammatory response through a number of pathways,
      including their role as precursors for synthesis of eicosanoids and their
      inhibitory effect on the synthesis of the n-3 PUFAs eicosapentanoic acid and
      docosahexanoic acid. The increase in n-6 PUFA intake affects individuals of all
      ages, with fetal PUFA accretion and infant dietary PUFA intake from breast milk
      reflecting maternal dietary intake. A high level of n-6 PUFA in milk results in
      increased n-6 PUFA in colonic phospholipids and an exaggerated inflammatory
      response to chemically induced colitis. Conversely, during development, a diet
      low in n-6 PUFAs and high in n-3 PUFAs increases colonic n-3 fatty acids,
      attenuates the inflammatory response, and lowers colonic damage. High dietary n-6
      PUFA intake may be an important environmental modifier that contributes to
      inflammatory bowel diseases.

TI  - Probiotic administration in patients with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for
      ulcerative colitis is associated with expansion of mucosal regulatory cells.
PG  - 662-8
LID - 10.1002/ibd.20369 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics have anti-inflammatory effects in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease and appear to regulate mucosal immune response through
      reductions in proinflammatory cytokines. The probiotic VSL#3 prevents pouchitis
      if started within a week of ileostomy closure and maintains remission following
      antibacterial treatment in patients with refractory or recurrent pouchitis.
      However, the efficacy of probiotics and their effects on regulatory cells if
      started at a greater time after surgery in patients undergoing ileal pouch anal
      anastomosis (IPAA) for ulcerative colitis are unknown. METHODS: We conducted an
      open-label study in which 31 patients at different periods from surgery without
      signs and symptoms of pouchitis were randomized to 2 sachets of VSL#3 once daily 
      or no treatment for 12 months. Pouchitis disease activity index (PDAI) was
      evaluated at baseline and after 3, 6, and 12 months. The percentage of CD4+ T
      lymphocytes expressing CD25 and the inactive form of transforming growth
      factor-beta [latency-associated peptide (LAP)] were evaluated at baseline and
      after 3 and 6 months in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells and mucosal biopsies. 
      Variation in tissue interleukin-1beta and Foxp3 mRNA expression was also
      evaluated. RESULTS: During the study period, VSL#3-treated patients showed a
      significant reduction in PDAI score and a significant increase in the percentage 
      of mucosal CD4+CD25(high) and CD4+ LAP-positive cells compared with baseline
      values. Tissue samples at different points showed a significant reduction in
      IL-1beta mRNA expression, and a significant increase in Foxp3 mRNA expression.
      CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that VSL#3 administration in patients with IPAA
      modulates the PDAI and expands the number of mucosal regulatory T cells.

PG  - 1012-8
LID - 10.1002/ibd.20377 [doi]
AB  - The probiotic Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 is in addition to some
      Lactobacilli sp. one of the best-studied probiotic strains. This particular E.
      coli strain was isolated in 1917 based on its potential to protect from
      presumably infectious gastroenteritis. Initial therapeutic success was noted in
      the management of gastrointestinal infectious disorders and infections affecting 
      the urinary tract; the focus shifted later to chronic inflammatory conditions.
      The unique combination of fitness and survival factors to support intestinal
      survival, the lack of virulence, and obvious probiotic properties make this
      microorganism a safe and effective candidate in the treatment of chronic
      inflammatory bowel diseases. Three large clinical trials have assessed the
      potential in the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis and equivalence
      to standard 5-ASA medication was documented. This review aims to discuss
      important mechanisms of E. coli Nissle 1917 and will review the available
      literature regarding treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases.

TI  - Treatment of inflammatory bowel disease: a review of medical therapy.
PG  - 354-77
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic inflammatory
      diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. While a cure remains elusive, both can be
      treated with medications that induce and maintain remission. With the recent
      advent of therapies that inhibit tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha the overlap in
      medical therapies for UC and CD has become greater. Although 5-ASA agents have
      been a mainstay in the treatment of both CD and UC, the data for their efficacy
      in patients with CD, particularly as maintenance therapy, are equivocal.
      Antibiotics may have a limited role in the treatment of colonic CD. Steroids
      continue to be the first choice to treat active disease not responsive to other
      more conservative therapy; non-systemic steroids such as oral and rectal
      budesonide for ileal and right-sided CD and distal UC respectively are also
      effective in mild-moderate disease. 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and its prodrug
      azathioprine are steroid-sparing immunomodulators effective in the maintenance of
      remission of both CD and UC, while methotrexate may be used in both induction and
      maintenance of CD. Infliximab and adalimumab are anti-TNF agents approved in the 
      US and Europe for the treatment of Crohn's disease, and infliximab is also
      approved for the treatment of UC.

AB  - Probiotic bacteria are used to treat or prevent a broad range of human diseases, 
      conditions, and syndromes. In addition, there are areas of medical use that have 
      been proposed for future probiotic applications. Randomized double-blind studies 
      have provided evidence of probiotic effectiveness for the treatment and
      prevention of acute diarrhea and antibiotic-induced diarrhea, as well as for the 
      prevention of cow milk-induced food allergy in infants and young children.
      Research studies have also provided evidence of effectiveness for the prevention 
      of traveler's diarrhea, relapsing Clostridium difficile-induced colitis, and
      urinary tract infections. There are also studies indicating that probiotics may
      be useful for prevention of respiratory infections in children, dental caries,
      irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease. Areas of future
      interest for the application of probiotics include colon and bladder cancers,
      diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis. The probiotics with the greatest number of
      proven benefits are Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG and Saccharomyces
      boulardii.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics, defined as live micro-organisms with beneficial effects
      for the host, are widely applied in gastrointestinal and liver diseases. AIM AND 
      METHOD: To review the available evidence of clinical trials on probiotics in
      gastrointestinal and liver diseases, with a major focus on irritable bowel
      syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis and chronic liver diseases.
      RESULTS: Evidence for the therapeutic or preventive application of particular
      probiotic strains is available for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea,
      rota-virus-associated diarrhoea and pouchitis. Results are encouraging for
      irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis and for reducing side effects by
      Helicobacter pylori eradication therapies, but are less clear for Crohn's
      disease, lactose intolerance and constipation. In general, for most of these
      patient groups, more placebo-controlled methodologically well-designed studies
      that pay attention to both clinical outcome and mechanistic aspects are required.
      The application in liver disease and pancreatitis is promising, but more human
      trials have to be awaited. Possible mechanisms of probiotics include modulation
      of the intestinal microbiota and the immune system, but different bacterial may
      have different effects. CONCLUSION: Further insight into disease entities and the
      functioning of probiotic strains is required to be able to select
      disease-specific strains, which have to be tested in well-designed
      placebo-controlled studies.

TI  - Occurrence of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in retail raw meat products in Ethiopia.
PG  - 389-93
AB  - BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli O157:H7 (E. coli O157:H7) is now recognized as a
      major cause of diarrhoea, hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic-uremic syndrome
      worldwide. Consumption of raw or undercooked meat of bovine origin has been the
      most common means of transmitting this organism. METHODOLOGY: Over a period of 7 
      months (October 2006 to April 2007), a total of 738 raw meat samples were
      collected from bovines (n= 250), sheep (n=243) and goat (n=245) and investigated 
      for the presence of E. coli O157: H7. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was
      performed using the disk diffusion method. RESULTS: E. coli O157:H7 were isolated
      from 31 (4.2%) out of 738 meat samples examined. Among meat samples examined, the
      highest prevalence (8%) was recorded in beef, followed by lamb and mutton (2.5%) 
      and goat meat (2%). The isolated strains were found to be susceptible (100%) to
      amikacin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, norfloxacin,
      polymyxin B and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Multidrug resistance to three or
      more drugs was detected in 7/31 (22.6%) strains. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this
      study revealed the presence of E. coli O157:H7 in retail raw meats reaching
      consumers, indicating possible risks of infection to people through the
      consumption of raw/under-cooked meat or cross-contamination of other food
      products. Coordinated actions are needed to reduce or eliminate the risks posed
      by this organism at various stages in food chain. Multiple drug resistant
      isolates detected in the present study may pose a threat to humans and further
      limit therapeutic options.

TI  - The use of a nursing model to understand diarrhea and the role of probiotics in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 418-23; quiz 424-5
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease, an umbrella term used for Crohn disease and
      ulcerative colitis, is often accompanied with the presenting symptom of diarrhea.
      This symptom can be a great nuisance and emotionally distressing to the
      individual with inflammatory bowel disease. Although the exact etiology of
      inflammatory bowel disease is still unknown, interactions between the host
      susceptibility, mucosal immunity, and intestinal microflora are thought to be
      major factors. One intervention that is gaining increasing support by the
      research and medical community is the use of probiotics, which work on the
      intestinal flora by altering the bacterial composition and thereby rendering the 
      environment unfavorable to pathogenic organisms. The human response to illness
      model provides an ideal organizing framework to gain a comprehensive
      understanding of the human response of diarrhea in the inflammatory bowel disease
      population. By examining the physiological, pathophysiological, behavioral, and
      experiential perspectives as well as individual vulnerabilities, this model
      establishes sound rationale to guide nursing interventions to help the individual
      better cope with the physical and emotional effects of having diarrhea. This
      model also facilitates the provision of holistic and personalized care, which may
      include the use of probiotics to help alleviate this distressing symptom.

AB  - Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli isolates from two 2006 outbreaks were
      compared to other O157:H7 isolates for virulence genotype, biofilm formation, and
      stress responses. Spinach- and lettuce-related-outbreak strains had similar
      pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns, and all carried both stx2 and stx2c
      variant genes. Cooperative biofilm formation involving an E. coli O157:H7 strain 
      and a non-O157:H7 strain was also demonstrated.

TI  - Probiotics and remission of ulcerative colitis: a systematic review.
PG  - 411-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an acute and inflammatory disease of the
      large bowel of unknown aetiology. The use of probiotics for this disease remains 
      controversial. The objective of this systematic review was to identify studies
      based on randomised controlled trials comparing the effect of probiotics to the
      effect of anti-inflammatory drugs or placebo in the remission of UC. METHODS: We 
      conducted a systematic review of clinical trials comparing the effect of
      probiotics to the effect of anti-inflammatory treatment or placebo in the
      remission of UC. PubMed, scienceDirect, Cochrane, Google scholar, metaRegister of
      Controlled Trials and National Institutes of Health were searched. RESULTS: Nine 
      studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies present a significant
      heterogeneity concerning their methodology and their results. The improvement in 
      UC remission and the frequency of adverse effects do not differ significantly
      between probiotic and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: There are a limited number of 
      randomised trials published in the field of probiotics used for the remission of 
      UC, and they present many methodological differences. The existing studies
      suggest a similar safety and efficacy of probiotics in comparison with
      anti-inflammatory drugs.

TI  - Lactobacillus fermentum ACA-DC 179 displays probiotic potential in vitro and
      protects against trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis and
      Salmonella infection in murine models.
PG  - 18-26
AB  - Lactobacillus fermentum ACA-DC 179, Lactobacillus plantarum ACA-DC 287 and
      Streptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC 198 were studied for their probiotic potential. 
      Firstly, strains were screened for antimicrobial activity towards a broad range
      of target strains, including lactic acid bacteria, food spoilage and pathogenic
      bacteria. L. fermentum ACA-DC 179 was active against five streptococci, including
      the two pathogenic strains Streptococcus oralis LMG 14532T and Streptococcus
      pneumoniae LMG 14545T. S. macedonicus ACA-DC 198 was active against the majority 
      of the strains tested, including not only lactic acid bacteria but also many food
      spoilage or pathogenic species. The three potential probiotic strains were found 
      to survive variably at pH 2.5 and were unaffected by bile salts. Only S.
      macedonicus ACA-DC 198 exhibited bile salt hydrolase activity, while none of the 
      strains was haemolytic. Moreover, strains exhibited variable susceptibility
      towards commonly used antibiotics. L. plantarum ACA-DC 287 and S. macedonicus
      ACA-DC 198 induced the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-12,
      IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Also
      elevated levels of the anti-inflammatory IL-10 were observed with L. fermentum
      ACA-DC 179. This strain consequently was found to significantly reduce colitis in
      a TNBS-induced colitis mouse model. Furthermore, L. fermentum ACA-DC 179 was
      successfully applied in an experimental Salmonella-infection mouse model. To
      conclude, strain L. fermentum ACA-DC 179 possesses desirable probiotic
      properties, such as antimicrobial activity and immunomodulation in vitro, which
      were confirmed in vivo by the use of animal models.

TI  - Differential clustering of bowel biopsy-associated bacterial profiles of
      specimens collected in Mexico and Canada: what do these profiles represent?
PG  - 111-7
AB  - Bowel commensals appear to be an important source of antigens that drive the
      chronic immune inflammation characteristic of Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis [inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)]. Biopsy-associated bacteria are
      assumed to be particularly relevant in bacteriological investigations of IBD
      because they are assumed to be located on the mucosal surface and hence close to 
      immunological cells. This investigation analysed the bacterial collections
      associated with bowel biopsies, aspirates of residual fluid after bowel cleansing
      and faeces from IBD patients and non-IBD subjects in Edmonton, Canada, and Mexico
      City, Mexico. Temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis of 16S rRNA gene 
      sequences produced profiles of the bacterial collections and their similarities
      were compared. Similarity analysis showed that the profiles did not cluster
      according to disease status, but that Canadian and Mexican profiles could be
      differentiated by this method. Comparison of biopsy, aspirate and faecal samples 
      obtained from the same subject showed that, on average, the profiles were highly 
      similar. Therefore, biopsy-associated bacteria are likely to represent, at least 
      in part, contaminants from the fluid, which resembles a faecal solution, that
      pools in the bowel after cleansing prior to endoscopy.

TI  - Dietary intake and body composition of Japanese ulcerative colitis patients in
      remission.
PG  - 357-62
AB  - The purpose of this pilot study (N=26) was to investigate dietary intake and body
      composition and problems associated with dietary intake (such as unnecessary
      dietary restriction) in Japanese patients in remission from ulcerative colitis.
      Findings revealed the macronutrient intake and dietary fiber (absolute amount)
      were lower than the national average in men, but this may have been due to
      differences in the methods used to measure dietary intake. Although the fat
      intake (%E) of ulcerative colitis patients in this study was similar to that of
      the Japanese population, it differed greatly from that of people in Western
      countries. No significant differences in weight, height, or body mass index were 
      found when comparing the sample of individuals living with ulcerative colitis
      with the general Japanese population. Seventeen patients (65.4%) reported being
      cautious about what they ate even though in remission, and 6 patients were even
      more cautious about what they ate now than they had been in the past. The authors
      suggest further research to clarify the problems that unnecessary dietary
      restriction cause for ulcerative colitis patients who are in remission.

TI  - Pathogenesis and treatment of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli infections.
PG  - 38-47
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli cause hemorrhagic
      colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome. We will summarize the literature on
      incidence and outcomes of these infections, and then review the pathogenesis to
      explain the current recommendations against antibiotic use and to suggest
      alternative therapies. RECENT FINDINGS: Shiga toxin-producing E. coli continue to
      be prevalent in the industrialized world because of dissemination in food
      products contaminated by ruminant feces. Declines in ground beef-related
      outbreaks have been matched by increased cases related to green vegetables.
      Fifteen percent of patients infected with E. coli O157:H7 progress to hemolytic
      uremic syndrome, but this figure may reach 50% if antibiotics are used.
      Mechanisms for bacteriophage induction causing Shiga toxin production, and for
      Shiga toxin dissemination to endothelium in gut, kidney and brain, may explain
      the negative effects of antibiotics and lead to rational therapies. Shiga toxin
      binders were not effective in clinical trials, but more avid binding agents may
      be. Current treatment recommendations are to maintain hydration to prevent
      thrombotic complications. Human vaccines are unlikely to be utilized. Cattle
      vaccines may prove the most significant approach to this disease. SUMMARY:
      Improved understanding of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli pathophysiology 
      and progression to hemolytic uremic syndrome provides the basis for prevention,
      prophylactic and treatment strategies.

TI  - Dietary antigens in Crohn's disease: antibodies to porcine pancreatic amylase.
PG  - 656-64
AB  - OBJECTIVES: There is no clear evidence that dietary proteins aggravate Crohn's
      disease (CD). We aimed to clarify the antibody response to dietary proteins in
      CD. METHODS: Antibody to porcine pancreatic amylase (PPA) a protease-resistant
      dietary protein (anti-PPA), was examined in CD patients (N = 104), ulcerative
      colitis (UC) patients (N = 85), and healthy controls (N = 83), and its
      relationship with the clinical characteristics of CD was investigated. Antibodies
      to casein and ovalbumin, anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA), and
      antibodies to I2 from Pseudomonas fluorescens (anti-I2) were also examined.
      RESULTS: Thirty-eight percent (39/104) of the CD patients expressed anti-PPA
      antibodies, and this percentage was significantly higher as compared with the
      control group (5%, 4/83) and the UC group (9%, 8/85) (P < 0.001). A significantly
      higher level of anti-PPA antibodies was detected in patients with "small bowel
      disease-dominant" CD than in those with "colitis-dominant" CD (P < 0.05).
      Antibodies to casein and ovalbumin were not specifically expressed in CD
      patients. As ASCA was detected in 33% and anti-I2 in 46% of the CD patients, 72% 
      of the CD patients were found positive for at least one of the three antibodies
      including anti-PPA antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: CD patients showed a specific
      antibody response to PPA, as compared with UC patients and controls. There was a 
      significantly higher level of anti-PPA antibody in patients with "small bowel
      disease-dominant" CD, suggesting that dietary proteins could play a role in the
      inflammatory response in CD patients with small bowel disease. Anti-PPA
      antibodies combined with ASCA/anti-I2 may be useful for the diagnosis of CD.

TI  - Prebiotics in inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - S85-9
AB  - In genetically susceptible individuals, an altered mucosal immune response
      against some commensal bacteria of the gut ecosystem appears to be the principal 
      mechanism leading to intestinal lesions in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The 
      information currently available does not provide an exact explanation about the
      origin of this important dysfunction of the interaction between host and
      commensal bacteria, but an altered microbial composition has been detected in the
      gut ecosystem of patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Prebiotics 
      are food ingredients not digested nor absorbed in the upper intestinal tract that
      are fermented by intestinal bacteria in a selective way promoting changes in the 
      gut ecosystem. Experimental and human studies have shown that inulin and
      oligofructose stimulate saccharolysis in the colonic lumen and favour the growth 
      of indigenous lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. These effects are associated with 
      reduced mucosal inflammation in animal models of IBD. Strong experimental
      evidence supports the hypothesis that inulin and oligofructose can offer an
      opportunity to prevent or mitigate intestinal inflammatory lesions in human
      Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis. Encouraging results have been
      obtained in preliminary clinical trials.

AB  - We formulated a filling for sandwich cookies containing 400 mg of
      eicosapentaenoic acid, 20:5, n-3 (EPA) + docosahexaenoic acid, 22:6, n-3 (DHA)
      encapsulated in a matrix of starch and gelatin. Cookies were stored at 2
      different temperatures (18 degrees C and 35 degrees C) and under 2 different
      packaging conditions (atmospheric and vacuum packed) for 28 d. At regular
      intervals, cookies were analyzed for moisture, water activity, and concentrations
      of EPA, DHA, and dienes. Results showed that there were no significant losses of 
      EPA and DHA during storage under the conditions of study. A maximum loss of 5%
      was observed after 28 d of storage. The concentration of dienes obtained under
      different conditions were low (< 25 mmol/kg) as compared to a salmon oil sample
      with appreciable signs of oxidation (600 mmol/kg). Sensory evaluation of cookies 
      by an untrained panel of healthy consumers and ulcerative colitis patients
      revealed no aftertaste and high acceptability of the cookies. Our results
      demonstrated that it is possible to make shelf-stable fortified foods with high
      levels of long-chain omega3FA.

TI  - Probiotics in the management of colonic disorders.
PG  - 434-40
AB  - Probiotics have been used in humans for almost a century and widely recommended
      for the treatment of a variety of ills assumed to be of colonic origin, including
      diarrhea, constipation, bloating, and flatulence. More recently, probiotics have 
      been evaluated in the management of specific colonic disorders such as
      inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and Clostridium difficile
      colitis. It is evident that no two probiotics are exactly alike; why then should 
      we expect reproducible results from studies that employ different species or
      strains, variable formulations, and diverse dosing schedules? When probiotics
      have been studied with the rigor appropriate to a new therapeutic modality, some 
      coherent results have emerged: specific strains are effective in certain
      diarrheal states, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis, as
      well as in the prevention of C. difficile-related colitis. Even here, not to
      mention other colonic disorders, further adequately powered and appropriately
      designed trials are needed.

TI  - Cross reactivity of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7-specific sera with
      non-O157 serotypes.
PG  - 8262-9
AB  - Escherichia coli O157:H7 is an important food- and water-borne pathogen of
      humans, causing Hemorrhagic Colitis and Haemolytic Uremic Syndrome. Colonization 
      of both cattle and human hosts is mediated through the action of effector
      molecules secreted via a Type III secretion system, a mechanism shared by other
      enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). We recently reported that vaccination of cattle
      with Type III-secreted proteins (TTSPs) resulted in decreased shedding of the
      organism following both experimental infection as well as under conditions of
      natural exposure. In order to extend this to non-O157 EHEC serotypes, we examined
      the serological cross reactivity of TTSPs of serotypes O26:H11, O103:H2, O111:NM 
      and O157:H7. Western blotting experiments with polyclonal antisera directed
      against serotype O157:H7 TTSPs suggested that there was significant cross
      reactivity, although there was limited cross reactivity when two Tir- and
      EspA-specific monoclonal antibodies were used. Groups of cattle were then
      vaccinated with TTSPs produced from each of the above serotypes and the magnitude
      and specificity of the responses were measured. All animals responded well with
      antibodies to TTSPs of the homologous serotype. However, limited cross reactivity
      was observed against the others. No cross reactivity was observed against Tir and
      EspA of serotype O157:H7. These results suggest that vaccination of cattle with
      TTSPs as a means of reducing the risk of EHEC transmission to humans will induce 
      protection that is serotype specific.

TI  - [The role of translational research in inflammatory bowel disease].
PG  - 146-53
AB  - The idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases, broadly classified as either Crohn's 
      disease or ulcerative colitis, are caused by a dysregulated mucosal immune
      response to a luminal antigen, possibly a bacterium, in a genetically predisposed
      host. A rapid expansion of knowledge in recent years has greatly increased our
      understanding of the pathophysiology of these disorders. For example, the
      relatively recent discovery of the NOD2 gene, a protein involved in bacterial
      sensing, has provided further evidence of the complex interplay between hosts and
      microbes in Crohn's disease. Significant recent advances have also occurred with 
      the discovery of the role of Toll-like receptors and dendritic cells in the
      development of gut inflammation, and the role of proinflammatory cytokines in the
      development and potentiation of gut inflammation. This article presents an update
      on these key developments and emphasizes the translational aspects of research
      that are directly related to patient care.

TI  - Intestinal immune activation in juvenile idiopathic arthritis and connective
      tissue disease.
PG  - 386-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the prevalence of immune activation in gastrointestinal
      (GI) mucosa in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) or connective
      tissue disease (CTD). STUDY DESIGN: We studied 27 children (15 girls, mean age
      9.8+/-4.8 years) with JIA/CTD and GI symptoms, including nine with
      oligoarthritis, nine with polyarthritis, two with systemic arthritis, three with 
      enthesitis-related arthritis, and four with various CTDs. The control group
      consists of 54 children (31 girls, mean age 11.3+/-6.3 years) with GI symptoms
      but shown to have no significant GI or rheumatoid disorder. The subjects were
      examined by gastroduodenoscopy (22 patients, 50 controls) and colonoscopy (23
      patients, 16 controls). Intraepithelial CD3+, alpha/beta+, and gamma/delta+
      lymphocytes were counted from duodenal and ileal biopsies. RESULTS: Five patients
      with JIA/CTD (19%) had ulcerative colitis. Lymphoid nodular hyperplasia (LNH) was
      more common in the patients [74% (20/27)] than in the controls [16% (8/50), p =
      0.001], as well in the duodenal bulb [29% (7/24) vs. 10% (5/50)], terminal ileum 
      [74% (14/19) vs. 38% (5/13)], and the colon [50% (11/22) vs. 14% (2/14)]. In the 
      duodenum, CD3, alpha/beta+, and gamma/delta+ lymphocytes counts were higher in
      JIA/CTD (p<0.05). In the ileum, gamma/delta+ cell numbers had increased in
      JIA/CTD (p<0.05). Either LNH, increased gamma/delta+ count, or both were more
      common in JIA/CTD [89% (24/27)] than in the controls [13% (7/54), p<0.0001].
      CONCLUSIONS: The majority of children suffering from JIA or CTD with GI symptoms 
      show abnormalities consistent with activation of the intestinal immune system.
      The aetiology of this reaction remains unknown, but similar features are seen in 
      delayed-type food allergy.

TI  - Inulin and oligofructose in chronic inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 2572S-2575S
LID - 10.1093/jn/137.11.2572S [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, also called chronic inflammatory bowel
      diseases (IBD), affect up to 500 per 100,000 persons in the Western world. Recent
      studies in the etiology of IBD suggest that these diseases are caused by a
      combination of genetic, environmental, and immunological factors. Results from
      humans and especially animal models of colitis reported by our group and others
      have indicated that these diseases result from a lack of tolerance to resident
      intestinal bacteria in genetically susceptible hosts. Probiotic bacteria have
      health-promoting effects for the host when ingested and have also shown efficacy 
      in ulcerative colitis and refractory pouchitis. In light of the efficacy of
      providing probiotic bacteria to patients with IBD, there has been interest in the
      prophylactic and therapeutic potential of inulin, oligofructose, and other
      prebiotics for patients with or at risk of IBD. Prebiotics are nondigestible
      dietary oligosaccharides that affect the host by selectively stimulating growth, 
      activity, or both of selective intestinal (probiotic) bacteria. Prebiotics are
      easy to administer and, in contrast to probiotic therapy, do not require
      administration of large amounts of (live) bacteria and are therefore easier to
      administer. Studies using prebiotics, especially beta-fructan oligosaccharides,
      for the treatment of chronic intestinal inflammation have shown benefit in animal
      models of colitis. Studies using these prebiotics alone or in combination with
      probiotics are emerging and have shown promise. These dietary therapies could
      lead to novel treatments for these chronic debilitating diseases.

TI  - Intestinal adherence associated with type IV pili of enterohemorrhagic
      Escherichia coli O157:H7.
PG  - 3519-29
AB  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 causes hemorrhagic colitis and 
      hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) by colonizing the gut mucosa and producing Shiga 
      toxins (Stx). The only factor clearly demonstrated to play a role in EHEC
      adherence to intestinal epithelial cells is intimin, which binds host cell
      integrins and nucleolin, as well as a receptor (Tir) that it injects into the
      host cell. Here we report that EHEC O157:H7 produces adhesive type IV pili, which
      we term hemorrhagic coli pilus (HCP), composed of a 19-kDa pilin subunit (HcpA)
      that is encoded by the hcpA chromosomal gene. HCP were observed as bundles of
      fibers greater than 10 microm in length that formed physical bridges between
      bacteria adhering to human and bovine host cells. Sera of HUS patients, but not
      healthy individuals, recognized HcpA, suggesting that the pili are produced in
      vivo during EHEC infections. Inactivation of the hcpA gene in EHEC EDL933
      resulted in significantly reduced adherence to cultured human intestinal and
      bovine renal epithelial cells and to porcine and bovine gut explants. An escN
      mutant, which is unable to translocate Tir, adhered less than the hcpA mutant,
      suggesting that adherence mediated by intimin-Tir interactions is a prelude to
      HCP-mediated adherence. An hcpA and stx1,2 triple mutant and an hcpA mutant had
      similar levels of adherence to bovine and human epithelial cells while a stx1,2
      double mutant had only a minor defect in adherence, indicating that HCP-mediated 
      adherence and cytotoxicity are independent events. Our data establish that EHEC
      O157:H7 HCP are intestinal colonization factors that are likely to contribute to 
      the pathogenic potential of this food-borne pathogen.

TI  - Chemoprevention of colorectal cancer.
PG  - 51-67
AB  - Colorectal cancer is a major cause of mortality and treatment costs are
      considerable. Advocating lifestyle modification, faecal occult blood testing and 
      surveillance colonoscopy in appropriate populations are already in practice. A
      developing concept is chemoprevention. Several models of carcinogenesis in
      colorectal cancer have been developed and there is an increasing database on the 
      major molecular mechanisms involved in carcinogenesis mainly from preclinical
      experiments and phase I trials. There have been several large epidemiological and
      observational studies to evaluate possible protective effects of >200 agents.
      More recently, case-control and cohort studies and well-conceived, phase II/III
      clinical trials have been done or are under way to evaluate putative
      chemopreventive agents including established drugs like aspirin and non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 5-aminosalicylates and statins; more
      controversial drugs like cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, ursodeoxycholic
      acid; various vitamins and micronutrients including calcium, selenium, folic
      acid, and dietary fibre, fat and protein content. Despite promising outcome in
      preclinical studies, there is currently very limited data from well-controlled
      and appropriately powered clinical studies. The most promising agents currently
      are aspirin, traditional NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors. The recent reports of
      cardiovascular risks of the COX-2 inhibitors and some traditional NSAIDs have
      resulted in stagnation of the field. Pending the expected release of results from
      several phase III trials in the near future, chemoprevention for colorectal
      cancer can only be practically considered in the very-high-risk population like
      those with familial adenomatous polyposis and ulcerative colitis, in conjunction 
      with surveillance colonoscopy. This article reviews the major models of
      colorectal carcinogenesis, the concept of chemoprevention with special reference 
      to colorectal cancer and the current state of clinical literature and the future 
      direction of colorectal cancer chemoprevention for both researcher and clinician 
      alike.

TI  - Probiotics for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - CD005573
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is an inflammatory condition affecting the
      colon with an incidence of approximately 10-20 per 100,000 per year. No existing 
      intervention is effective in all patients with a proportion requiring colectomy. 
      There are significant proportion of patients who experience adverse effects with 
      current therapies. Consequently, new alternatives for the treatment of UC are
      constantly being sought. Probiotics are live microbial feed supplements that may 
      beneficially affect the host by improving intestinal microbial balance, enhancing
      gut barrier function and improving local immune response. OBJECTIVES: To assess
      the efficacy of probiotics compared with placebo or standard medical treatment
      (5-aminosalicylates, sulfasalazine or corticosteroids) for the induction of
      remission in active ulcerative colitis. SEARCH STRATEGY: A comprehensive search
      for relevant randomised controlled trials (RCT's) was carried out using MEDLINE
      (1966-January 2006), EMBASE (January 1985- 2006) and CENTRAL. The Cochrane
      IBD/FBD Review Group Specialised Trials Registrar was also searched. The
      Australasian Medical Index, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Latin
      American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), and the Japan Information
      Centre of Science and Technology File on Science, Technology and Medicine
      (JICST-E) were also used to identify abstracts. Conference proceedings from the
      Falk Symposium, Digestive Disease Week (DDW) and the United European Digestive
      Disease week were hand-searched. Authors of relevant studies and drug companies
      were contacted regarding ongoing or unpublished trials that may be relevant to
      the review. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials investigating the
      effectiveness of probiotics compared to standard treatments in the induction of
      remission of active ulcerative colitis DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors 
      independently assessed trial quality and extracted data for analysis. Data were
      analysed using RevMan 4.2.7. A formal meta-analysis was not preformed due to
      differences in probiotics, outcomes and trial methodology. MAIN RESULTS: None of 
      the included studies reported any statistically significant differences in
      remission or clinical improvement rates between probiotic and placebo or active
      comparator groups. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Conventional therapy combined with a
      probiotic does not improve overall remission rates in patients with mild to
      moderate ulcerative colitis. However, there is limited evidence that probiotics
      added to standard therapy may provide modest benefits in terms of reduction of
      disease activity in patients with mild to moderately severe ulcerative colitis.
      Whether probiotics are as effective in patients with severe and more extensive
      disease and whether they can be used as an alternative to existing therapies is
      unknown. Further well designed, larger randomised controlled trials are needed to
      determine whether probiotics can be used as an alternative to current treatment
      modalities.

TI  - [Enteral nutrition in the therapy of gastrointestinal diseases (according to
      materials of the European Association of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition)].
PG  - 92-8, 129
AB  - The present article gives evidence-based recommendations for the indication,
      application and type of formula of enteral nutrition (EN) (oral nutrition
      supplements (ONS) or tube feeding (TF)) in patients with Crohn's disease (CD),
      ulcerative colitis (UC), short bowel syndrome (SBS), acute and chronic
      pancreatitis, alcoholic steatogepatitis and cirrosis. ONS and/or TF in addition
      to normal food is indicates in undernourished patients with CD or UC to improve
      nutritional status. In active CD EN is the first line therapy in children and
      should be used as sole therapy in adults mainly when treatment with
      corticosteroids is not feasible. No significant differences have been shown in
      the effects of free amino acid, peptide-based and hole protein formulae for TF.
      In remission ONS is recommended only in steroid dependent patients in CD. In
      patients with SBS TF should be introduced in the adaptation phase and should be
      changed with progressing adaptation to ONS in addition to normal food. Special
      nutrition support should not be used routinely in patients with mild or moderate 
      acute pancreatitis. EN is the preffered route in patients with pancreatitis and
      should be attempted before initiating parenteral nutrition. Nutrition assessment 
      in patients with liver disease should include screening for micronutrient
      deficiencies. Protein restriction should be implemented for the acute management 
      of hepatic encephalopathy and should not be implemented chronically in patients
      with liver disease.

TI  - High-dose probiotics for the treatment of active pouchitis.
PG  - 2075-82; discussion 2082-4
AB  - PURPOSE: Pouchitis is the major long-term complication after ileal-pouch anal
      anastomosis for ulcerative colitis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are the mainstay
      of treatment in this condition. Recently, we have shown the efficacy of a highly 
      concentrated probiotic preparation (VSL#3, 900 billions/sachet lyophilized viable
      bacteria) in preventing relapses of chronic pouchitis and in preventing pouchitis
      onset. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of high-dose VSL#3 in the
      treatment of mildly active pouchitis. METHODS: Twenty-three consecutive patients 
      with mild pouchitis, defined as a score of between 7 and 12 in the Pouchitis
      Disease Activity Index, which includes clinical, endoscopic, and histological
      criteria, were treated with VSL#3, 2 sachets b.i.d. (3,600 billion bacteria/day) 
      for four weeks. Symptomatic, endoscopic, and histologic evaluations were
      undertaken before and after treatment according to Pouchitis Disease Activity
      Index. Remission was defined as a combination of a Pouchitis Disease Activity
      Index clinical score of <or=2, endoscopic score of <or=1, and total Pouchitis
      Disease Activity Index score of <or=4. Patients in remission after treatment were
      treated with VSL#3, 1 sachet b.i.d. (1,800 billion bacteria), as maintenance
      treatment for six months. The quality of life was assessed with the Inflammatory 
      Bowel Disease Questionnaire. RESULTS: Sixteen of 23 patients (69 percent) were in
      remission after treatment. The median total Pouchitis Disease Activity Index
      scores before and after therapy were 10 (range, 9-12) and 4 (range, 2-11),
      respectively (P < 0.01). The median Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire
      score also significantly improved from 110 (range, 90-140) to 200 (range, 95-220;
      P < 0.001). All 16 patients who went into remission maintained remission during
      maintenance treatment. Only one patient experienced a transient bloating at the
      beginning of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: High doses of the probiotic VSL#3 are
      effective in the treatment of mild pouchitis. Further controlled studies are
      warranted.

TI  - Curcumin as "Curecumin": from kitchen to clinic.
PG  - 787-809
AB  - Although turmeric (Curcuma longa; an Indian spice) has been described in
      Ayurveda, as a treatment for inflammatory diseases and is referred by different
      names in different cultures, the active principle called curcumin or
      diferuloylmethane, a yellow pigment present in turmeric (curry powder) has been
      shown to exhibit numerous activities. Extensive research over the last half
      century has revealed several important functions of curcumin. It binds to a
      variety of proteins and inhibits the activity of various kinases. By modulating
      the activation of various transcription factors, curcumin regulates the
      expression of inflammatory enzymes, cytokines, adhesion molecules, and cell
      survival proteins. Curcumin also downregulates cyclin D1, cyclin E and MDM2; and 
      upregulates p21, p27, and p53. Various preclinical cell culture and animal
      studies suggest that curcumin has potential as an antiproliferative,
      anti-invasive, and antiangiogenic agent; as a mediator of chemoresistance and
      radioresistance; as a chemopreventive agent; and as a therapeutic agent in wound 
      healing, diabetes, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, cardiovascular disease, 
      pulmonary disease, and arthritis. Pilot phase I clinical trials have shown
      curcumin to be safe even when consumed at a daily dose of 12g for 3 months. Other
      clinical trials suggest a potential therapeutic role for curcumin in diseases
      such as familial adenomatous polyposis, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative
      colitis, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, hypercholesteremia, atherosclerosis,
      pancreatitis, psoriasis, chronic anterior uveitis and arthritis. Thus, curcumin, 
      a spice once relegated to the kitchen shelf, has moved into the clinic and may
      prove to be "Curecumin".

TI  - Gastrointestinal medications in pregnancy.
PG  - 849-77
AB  - Management of the pregnant patient presents unique challenges to the treating
      physician. Current Food and Drug Administration classifications do not
      necessarily reflect clinical experience or recent literature. Ideally, one should
      use the lowest-risk drug possible, with attention to the appropriate level of
      efficacy for the patient's condition, the stage of pregnancy and dose adjustment.
      Every treatment decision should be fully discussed with the patient and a
      multidisciplinary team that should include the obstetrician and, if appropriate, 
      the paediatrician. This review will cover the medications commonly used to treat 
      gastrointestinal disease. The majority of medications can be categorised as 'low 
      risk' or 'should be avoided'. The following medications should never be used
      during pregnancy due to the clear risk of teratogenicity or adverse events:
      bismuth, castor oil, sodium bicarbonate, methotrexate, ribavirin, doxycycline,
      tetracycline, and thalidomide.

TI  - Drug therapy for inflammatory bowel disease in pregnancy and the puerperium.
PG  - 835-47
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has a peak age of onset in the 3rd decade and a 
      peak prevalent age in the fourth decade in most studies. As a result many
      patients affected by Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are females of
      reproductive age interested in bearing children. It has been shown that the most 
      important factor in the success of a pregnancy in patients with IBD is the state 
      of disease activity. Therefore, the goal prior to and during pregnancy is to best
      optimise control of the disease through medical therapy. Unfortunately, many
      medications utilised to treat IBD are potentially toxic and/or teratogenic,
      leaving many physicians and patients without a clear answer as to the safest
      methods of therapy. This review attempts to summarise the medical literature to
      date, as it pertains to the safety of medical therapy for IBD during pregnancy
      and the puerperium.

TI  - Ulcerative colitis: responding to the challenges.
PG  - 657-60
AB  - Aminosalicylates are the first-line therapy for patients with mild to moderate
      active ulcerative colitis. Treatment should start at dosages of 4.8 g per day of 
      the active 5-aminosalicylate moiety, rather than starting at a lower dosage and
      increasing if treatment fails. Infliximab has been shown to be effective and is
      now approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of
      moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in patients who have had an
      inadequate response to conventional therapy.

TI  - Clinical effectiveness of probiotics therapy (BIO-THREE) in patients with
      ulcerative colitis refractory to conventional therapy.
PG  - 1306-11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Intestinal microflora has been implicated in the etiology of
      ulcerative colitis (UC). Over the past few years, the use of probiotics in UC has
      gained attention. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of
      probiotics therapy for mild to moderate distal UC refractory to conventional
      therapies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty patients with mild to moderate distal UC 
      took 9 BIO-THREE tablets per day for 4 weeks. Clinical symptoms and endoscopic
      findings were evaluated as ulcerative colitis disease activity index (UCDAI)
      scores before and after administration of BIO-THREE. Fecal samples were collected
      from all patients before and after probiotics administration, and fecal
      microflora was analyzed by the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism 
      (T-RFLP) method. RESULTS: Remission (UCDAI score < or =2) was observed in 45%
      (9/20) of the patients; response (decrease in UCDAI > or = 3, but final score >
      or = 3) in 10% (2/20); no response in 40% (8/20); and worsening (UCDAI > 3) in 5%
      (1/20). T-RFLP analysis indicated that the principal alteration in microflora was
      an increase in bifidobacteria. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that administration
      of BIO-THREE improved the clinical symptoms and endoscopic findings in patients
      with UC, indicating that administration of BIO-THREE is safe and efficacious for 
      the treatment of UC.

TI  - Aluminum is a potential environmental factor for Crohn's disease induction:
      extended hypothesis.
PG  - 329-45
AB  - Aluminum (Al) is a common environmental compound with immune-adjuvant activity
      and granulomatous inflammation inducer. Al exposure in food, additives, air,
      pharmaceuticals, and water pollution is ubiquitous in Western culture. Crohn's
      disease (CD) is a chronic relapsing intestinal inflammation in genetically
      susceptible individuals and is influenced by yet unidentified environmental
      factors. It is hypothesized, in the present review, that Al is a potential factor
      for induction or maintaining the inflammation in CD. Epidemiologically, CD
      incidence is higher in urban areas, where microparticle pollution is prevalent.
      Al immune activities share many characteristics with the immune pathology of CD: 
      increased antigen presentation and APCs activation, many luminal bacterial or
      dietary compounds can be adsorbed to the metal and induce Th1 profile activity,
      promotion of humoral and cellular immune responses, proinflammatory, apoptotic,
      oxidative activity, and stress-related molecule expression enhancement, affecting
      intestinal bacterial composition and virulence, granuloma formation, colitis
      induction in an animal model of CD, and terminal ileum uptake. The Al-bacterial
      interaction, the microparticles homing the intestine together with the extensive 
      immune activity, put Al as a potential environmental candidate for CD induction
      and maintenance.

TI  - Monospecific and bispecific antibodies against E. coli O157 for diagnostics.
PG  - 1-9
AB  - Escherichia coli O157:H7 is a serious human pathogen that causes hemorrhagic
      colitis, and occasionally hemolytic uremic syndrome. Identification of the O157
      antigen is an essential part of the detection and management of E. coli O157:H7. 
      A quadroma P126 secreting a bispecific hybrid MAb (bsMAb), which recognizes both 
      E. coli O157 and horseradish peroxidase in one molecule was produced by somatic
      hybridization of hybridomas specific for E. coli O157 and HRPO molecule. A bridge
      ELISA was used to select the quadromas obtained for bispecific monoclonal
      antibody purification and characterization. Benzhydroxamic-acid agarose (BHA)
      affinity co-chromatography was used as a convenient one-step method for purifying
      the HRPO-bsMAb complex for ultrasensitive diagnostic applications. Sandwich ELISA
      for detecting E. coli O157:H7 with HRPO-bsMAb allows quick one step detection of 
      spiked E. coli O157:H7. The detection sensitivities were 100 CFU, 750 CFU and 500
      CFU per 1 ml of tap water, lake water and apple juice respectively by microtiter 
      assay. E. coli O157:H7 detection with immunofilter ELISA and immunomagnetic ELISA
      formats was approximately 1 CFU/ml and 10 CFU/ml respectively. BsMAbs avoid
      enzyme conjugation, has highest specific activity and molecular uniformity
      without aggregates and contribute to good signal to noise ratios. This new
      bispecific antibody can be generated and purified from quadroma cultures by
      affinity co-chromatography in one step and can be used to develop a new
      generation of assays for public health applications in water, food and human
      sample testing.

TI  - Escherichia coli O26 in minced beef: prevalence, characterization and
      antimicrobial resistance pattern.
PG  - 218-22
AB  - Verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) non-O157 serogroups are among the
      most important emerging food-borne pathogen groups. In particular, the O26
      serogroup is able to cause a large spectrum of illnesses in humans which have a
      significant public health impact as they may range from haemorrhagic colitis (HC)
      to haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
      (TTP). It is known that VTEC organisms are associated with animal reservoirs,
      i.e. ruminants, and foods of animal origin, especially undercooked meat and raw
      milk, are often involved in outbreaks. In this study, 250 minced beef samples
      collected at retail outlets in southern Italy were tested for the presence of E. 
      coli O26 and the isolates were characterized and studied for their antimicrobial 
      resistance properties. Three minced beef samples (1.2%) tested positive for E.
      coli O26; one isolate per positive sample was characterized. One isolate
      harboured the genes encoding for virulence factors intimin (eaeA) and
      enterohaemolysin (hlyA), while none presented verocytotoxin-encoding genes (stx1 
      and stx2) and all were negative at the verotoxicity assay. All the isolates
      showed resistance properties to at least four antimicrobial agents tested and two
      were multi-drug resistant (MDR). Although no verocytotoxin-encoding genes were
      found in the isolates, the presence of potentially pathogenic E. coli O26 strains
      in minced beef points to the need for proper hygiene during meat production to
      reduce the risk of food-borne illnesses and transmission of MDR organisms via
      foods to humans. This paper is the first report on the presence and
      characterization of E. coli O26 in minced beef marketed in Italy.

TI  - Assessment of dietary intake and trace element status in patients with ileal
      pouch-anal anastomosis.
PG  - 1553-7
AB  - PURPOSE: Panproctocolectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is the operation of 
      choice for patients with ulcerative colitis and familial polyposis. The long-term
      nutritional consequences after pouch surgery are unknown. We have assessed the
      nutritional status of the essential trace elements-zinc, copper, manganese, and
      selenium-in patients several years (median, 10 (range, 2-15) years) after
      surgery. METHODS: Fifty-five patients with uncomplicated ileal pouch-anal
      anastomosis and 46 healthy control subjects were studied. A dietary assessment of
      trace element intake was undertaken by using a semiquantitative food frequency
      questionnaire. The patients' trace elements status for zinc, copper, manganese,
      and selenium was assessed by measuring their concentrations in blood. RESULTS:
      The dietary intake of individual trace elements was similar in both groups (all P
      values > 0.4). There was no significant difference in the concentrations of
      plasma copper, zinc, and selenium between patients and healthy control subjects
      (all P values > 0.07). The concentration of whole blood manganese was
      significantly higher (P = 0.004) in patients (median, 178.5 nmol/l; range, 59-478
      nmol/l) compared with healthy control subjects (median, 140 nmol/l; range, 53-267
      nmol/l). Four (7 percent) patients had manganese concentrations more than three
      standard deviations of the mean of control group (>255 nmol/l). CONCLUSIONS: This
      study shows that patients who have had uncomplicated pouch surgery have a normal 
      dietary intake of trace elements and do not develop deficiencies in copper, zinc,
      manganese, and selenium. However, these patients may be at increased risk of
      manganese toxicity.

TI  - Prescript-assist probiotic-prebiotic treatment for irritable bowel syndrome: an
      open-label, partially controlled, 1-year extension of a previously published
      controlled clinical trial.
PG  - 1153-60
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to extend a previous 2-week assessment of a 
      probiotic-prebiotic complex in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
      METHODS: In this open-label, partially controlled, 1-year (14 [2] months)
      extension study, data were collected from patients with IBS who continued
      treatment following a 2-week study of the efficacy of the probiotic-prebiotic
      complex. Data were collected at 2 and approximately 60 weeks after the end of the
      original study. RESULTS: A total of 25 patients entered the 2-week extension and 
      22 completed the approximately 60-week follow-up study (20 women, 2 men; age
      range, 20-70 years; all white). Results in the control group 2 weeks after
      crossover to treatment were similar to those from the original study, with
      reductions in IBS subsyndromes, as follows: general ill feelings/nausea (P <
      0.001), indigestion/flatulence (P < 0.001), and marginally colitis (P < 0.03
      [1-tailed]). Treatment was associated with a continued reduction in general ill
      feelings/nausea at 4 weeks (P < 0.007). At >or=52-week follow-up, the rate of
      remissions was 81.5% to 100% (P < 0.003). CONCLUSION: Based on the results from
      the present 1-year extension study, treatment with this probiotic-prebiotic
      complex may be an option for short-term (2-4 weeks) and long-term ( approximately
      60-week) reductions in IBS symptoms.

AB  - This article revises the concepts of prebiotics, probiotics and symbiotics, and
      their use in different situations of daily clinical practice. With a high level
      of evidence, it is concluded that the use of certain strains of probiotics
      significantly reduces the risk for antibiotic-induced diarrhea. Although further 
      studies are needed, the use of probiotics, prebiotics, and symbiotics in people
      suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (particularly ulcerative colitis, and
      pouchitis) might improve the rates of remission induction/maintenance. The
      administration of probiotics and symbiotics to patients with liver transplant,
      severe acute pancreatitis, and intensive and surgical care patients, emerges as a
      promising therapeutic option that seems to reduce the number of infections;
      however, it is currently no possible to establish evidence-based recommendations,
      with a need for a higher number of better designed works. About safety of
      probiotics and symbiotics, the benefits/risks ratio clearly favors the former
      since the risk for infection is low, even in immunosuppressed patients. There
      are, however, selected groups of patients in which caution is advised.

TI  - Functional fermented milk products.
PG  - 235-47; discussion 247-50
AB  - Fermented foods have been used since prehistoric times. Their number, variety and
      geographic origin are considerable, and different substrates and agents including
      bacteria, yeasts and moulds have been used in their preparation. In the last few 
      decades the scientific approach to the study of the participating microorganisms 
      and the resulting products have provided a better understanding of their
      biological importance. Among the many health-related properties of fermented
      foods, effects on blood pressure have been described after casein hydrolysis by
      lactic acid bacteria. Peptides with antimicrobial activity, mainly against
      Gram-negative bacteria, and derived from casein have also been identified. This
      could explain, at least in part, the antidiarrheal effects of fermented products 
      including those on traveler's diarrhea and against colonization by Helicobacter
      pylori. One of the best known advantages of fermented milk products is their
      capacity to improve lactose tolerance in hypolactasic subjects. With the growing 
      prevalence of allergies and inflammatory bowel diseases, considerable interest
      has been focused on the effects of lactic acid bacteria in these conditions;
      there is evidence that these agents are associated with improvements in allergy; 
      no such evidence exists for Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. A
      cholesterol-lowering capacity has also been described for some microorganisms.
      Not all the fermenting microorganisms have probiotic capacities as the latter are
      strain-specific.

TI  - Evidence for the use of probiotics and prebiotics in inflammatory bowel disease: 
      a review of clinical trials.
PG  - 307-15
AB  - Human subjects and their enteric microbiota have evolved together to reach a
      state of mutual tolerance. Mounting evidence from both animal models and human
      studies suggests that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents a malfunction
      of this relationship. The enteric microecology therefore represents an attractive
      therapeutic target with few side effects. Probiotics and prebiotics have been
      investigated in clinical trials as treatments for IBD, with conflicting results. 
      The evidence for the use of probiotics in the management of pouchitis is
      persuasive and several studies indicate their effectiveness in ulcerative
      colitis. Trials of probiotics and prebiotics in Crohn's disease are less
      convincing. However, methodologies vary widely and a range of probiotic,
      prebiotic and combination (synbiotic) treatments have been tested in a variety of
      patient groups with an assortment of end points. Conclusions about any one
      treatment in a specific patient group can therefore only be drawn on evidence
      from relatively small numbers of patients. The present article reviews the role
      of the intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBD and addresses the
      clinical evidence for the therapeutic manipulation of bowel microbiota using
      probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics in IBD.

TI  - The development of eosinophilic colitis after liver transplantation in children.
PG  - 518-23
AB  - Tacrolimus-based immunosuppression in pediatric liver transplant recipients is
      known to be associated with EGID. Our goal was to determine the incidence, risk
      factors, and characteristics of EGID in our pediatric liver transplantation
      program. This study was a retrospective analysis of 38 pediatric liver transplant
      recipients. Rectal mucosal biopsy was performed to evaluate for gastrointestinal 
      PTLD and eosinophilic colitis. There were 14 patients (37%) who were diagnosed
      with eosinophilic colitis. The mean age at transplantation was 10.8 +/- 1.8
      months. Those with eosinophilic colitis had a higher incidence of peripheral
      eosinophilia (p = 0.003) during the first two months following transplantation
      and had a higher EBV infection rate. Symptoms, such as diarrhea, hematochezia,
      and abdominal pain, became apparent after an average of three months; diagnoses
      were made at 6.9 +/- 2.0 months after transplantation. There were eight patients 
      (57%) with elevated food-specific IgE levels. With food restriction treatment,
      the symptoms of patients improved. EGID should be considered when clinical
      symptoms are present, because symptoms of this disorder are similar to those of
      gastrointestinal PTLD. It should also be considered when peripheral eosinophila
      is detected or when EBV seroconversion develops during the first two months
      following transplantation.

TI  - Emergence and control of fluoroquinolone-resistant, toxin A-negative, toxin
      B-positive Clostridium difficile.
PG  - 932-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile is a major cause of infectious diarrhea in
      hospitalized patients. Between August 2003 and January 2004, we experienced an
      increase in the incidence of C. difficile-associated disease. We describe the
      investigation into and management of the outbreak in this article. METHODS: A
      total of 73 consecutive patients with nosocomial C. difficile-associated diarrhea
      were identified. C. difficile isolates were characterized using toxin-specific
      enzyme immunoassays, a tissue-culture fibroblast cytotoxicity assay, polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR), and antimicrobial susceptibility tests. Rates of recurrence
      and of C. difficile colitis were recorded. Changes in antibiotic use and
      infection control policies were documented. RESULTS: The incidence of C.
      difficile-associated diarrhea peaked at 21 cases per 1,000 patient admissions. Of
      the C. difficile isolates recovered, 85 (95%) were identical toxin A-negative and
      toxin B-positive strains, corresponding to toxinotype VIII and PCR ribotype 017. 
      All clonal isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics, including ofloxacin, 
      ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and gatifloxacin (minimum inhibitory
      concentrations [MICs] of greater than 32 micro g/mL) and erythromycin,
      clarithromycin, and clindamycin (MICs of greater than 256 micro g/mL). Recurrent 
      C. difficile-associated disease occurred in 26 (36%) of the patients. At least 10
      (14%) of the patients developed C. difficile colitis. Additional infection
      control measures introduced included the use of ward memos, a hand-hygiene
      awareness campaign, increased environmental cleaning, attention to prescribing
      practices for antibiotics, increased awareness of diarrheal illness, and early
      isolation of affected patients. Total use of fluoroquinolones did not change
      throughout the study period. Despite persistence of this toxin-variant strain,
      the incidence of C. difficile-associated disease in our institution decreased to 
      fewer than 5 cases per 1,000 admissions. CONCLUSIONS: We report on the emergence 
      of a fluoroquinolone- and clindamycin-resistant, toxin A-negative, and toxin
      B-positive strain of C. difficile associated with an outbreak of C.
      difficile-associated disease in our institution during a 6-month period. We found
      that careful attention to improvement of infection control interventions was the 
      most important means of controlling this nosocomial pathogen.

TI  - Attenuation by dietary taurine of dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in mice 
      and of THP-1-induced damage to intestinal Caco-2 cell monolayers.
PG  - 217-24
AB  - The effects of dietary taurine on the experimental colitis induced by dextran
      sulfate sodium (DSS) in mice were evaluated. C57BL/6 female mice were given 3%
      DSS in drinking water for 5 d to induce acute colitis. Taurine at 2% was added to
      the drinking water 5 d before and during the DSS-treatment to investigate its
      preventive effect. Taurine supplementation significantly attenuated the weight
      decrease, diarrhea severity, colon shortening, and the increase in the colonic
      tissue myeloperoxidase activity induced by DSS. Taurine also significantly
      inhibited the increase in the expression of a pro-inflammatory chemokine,
      macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2), but not of interleukin (IL)-1beta or
      tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha mRNA. Furthermore, taurine significantly
      protected the intestinal Caco-2 cell monolayers from the damage by
      macrophage-like THP-1 cells in an in vitro coculture system. These results
      suggest that taurine prevented DSS-induced colitis partly in association with (1)
      its inhibitory effects on the secretion of MIP-2 from the intestinal epithelial
      cells and on the infiltration of such inflammatory cells as neutrophils and (2)
      its cytoprotective functions on the epithelial barrier from the direct toxicity
      of DSS and from the inflammatory cell-induced injury.

TI  - Dietary intake, neutrophil fatty acid profile, serum antioxidant vitamins and
      oxygen radical absorbance capacity in patients with ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 153-9
AB  - Nutrition may play an important role in the pathogenesis and treatment of
      ulcerative colitis. Several studies suggest an association between dietary
      factors and the onset of ulcerative colitis; however, only few studies have
      examined the relationship between dietary intake and relapse of ulcerative
      colitis. The aim of this study was to assess the dietary intake and antioxidative
      capacity of ulcerative colitis patients and to elucidate the efficacy of dietary 
      therapy for ulcerative colitis. Dietary intake, fatty acid composition of
      phospholipids in plasma and neutrophils, serum fat-soluble vitamin levels, and
      oxygen radical absorbance capacity were analyzed in 29 ulcerative colitis
      patients (7 males and 22 females), who were treated at the Department of
      Gastroenterology, Okayama University Hospital. Total fat intake, fat energy ratio
      and linoleic acid intake were significantly lower, while protein and carbohydrate
      intakes were significantly higher, in the patients than age- and sex-matched
      controls. In the neutrophil phospholipids of ulcerative colitis patients,
      significantly higher levels of linoleic aicd and arachidonic acid and a lower
      level of eicosapentaenoic acid were observed. The concentrations of serum retinol
      and beta-carotene but not alpha-tocopherol were significantly lower and serum
      oxygen radical absorbance capacity was also lower than in the controls.
      Significant correlations between serum oxygen radical absorbance capacity and
      retinol (r = 0.567, p = 0.0031), alpha-tocopherol (r = 0.560, p = 0.0036) and
      beta-carotene (r = 0.440, p = 0.0279) concentrations were observed in the
      ulcerative colitis patients. A diet restricting the intake of linoleic acid and
      supplemented with eicosapentaenoic acid and antioxidative vitamins may be
      recommendable for the nutritional management of ulcerative colitis patients.

TI  - Probiotics for Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea: focus on Lactobacillus 
      rhamnosus GG and Saccharomyces boulardii.
PG  - 1212-21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on the use of probiotics to treat or prevent 
      recurrences of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) by replacing
      normal gastric flora. DATA SOURCES: PubMed (1970-March 2007) was searched using
      the terms probiotics, Clostridium difficile, colitis, diarrhea, prevention, and
      treatment. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Case reports, case series, and
      clinical trials describing the use of probiotics in the treatment or prevention
      of recurrences of CDAD as primary outcome were included. DATA SYNTHESIS: A
      variety of controlled trials, case series, and case reports have evaluated
      probiotics to treat first or recurrent episodes of CDAD. In addition, a
      meta-analysis has been conducted to try to determine the role of probiotics in
      CDAD. In general, most case series and case reports have shown favorable results 
      with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG or Saccharomyces boulardii. However, other
      reports have shown lack of benefit. The meta-analysis showed that these
      probiotics may be useful in treating or preventing recurrences of CDAD.
      Nonetheless, the heterogeneity of the studies makes definite conclusions
      difficult. In addition, several cases of bacteremia or fungemia associated with
      probiotic use have been reported, particularly in the last decade. Patients most 
      commonly affected by these complications are immunosuppressed. Unfortunately,
      these are also the patients more likely to have severe CDAD or are at risk for
      recurrences. CONCLUSIONS: Additional experience with and study of probiotics are 
      warranted due to numerous unanswered questions. Given the potential for
      complications in debilitated and immunosuppressed patients, the risks may
      outweigh benefits, and rational antibiotic use may be a better option to prevent 
      a first episode or recurrence of CDAD.

TI  - Anti-inflammatory effects of probiotic yogurt in inflammatory bowel disease
      patients.
PG  - 470-9
AB  - Our aim was to assess anti-inflammatory effects on the peripheral blood of
      subjects with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who consumed probiotic yogurt for 
      1 month. We studied 20 healthy controls and 20 subjects with IBD, 15 of whom had 
      Crohn's disease and five with ulcerative colitis. All the subjects consumed
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and L. reuteri RC-14 supplemented yogurt for 30
      days. The presence of putative regulatory T (T(reg)) cells (CD4(+) CD25(high))
      and cytokines in T cells, monocytes and dendritic cells (DC) was determined by
      flow cytometry from peripheral blood before and after treatment, with or without 
      ex vivo stimulation. Serum and faecal cytokine concentrations were determined by 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The proportion of CD4(+) CD25(high) T cells
      increased significantly (P = 0.007) in IBD patients, mean (95% confidence
      interval: CI) 0.84% (95% CI 0.55-1.12) before and 1.25% (95% CI 0.97-1.54) after 
      treatment, but non-significantly in controls. The basal proportion of tumour
      necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha(+)/interleukin (IL)-12(+) monocytes and myeloid DC
      decreased in both subject groups, but of stimulated cells only in IBD patients.
      Also serum IL-12 concentrations and proportions of IL-2(+) and CD69(+) T cells
      from stimulated cells decreased in IBD patients. The increase in CD4(+)
      CD25(high) T cells correlated with the decrease in the percentage of TNF-alpha-
      or IL-12-producing monocytes and DC. The effect of the probiotic yogurt was
      confirmed by a follow-up study in which subjects consumed the yogurt without the 
      probiotic organisms. Probiotic yogurt intake was associated with significant
      anti-inflammatory effects that paralleled the expansion of peripheral pool of
      putative T(reg) cells in IBD patients and with few effects in controls.

TI  - Educational clinical case series for pediatric allergy and immunology: allergic
      proctocolitis, food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome and allergic
      eosinophilic gastroenteritis with protein-losing gastroenteropathy as
      manifestations of non-IgE-mediated cow's milk allergy.
PG  - 360-7
AB  - Cow's milk protein allergy is the most common food allergy in infants and young
      children. It is estimated that up to 50% of pediatric cow's milk allergy is
      non-IgE-mediated. Allergic proctocolitis is a benign disorder manifesting with
      blood-streaked stools in otherwise healthy-appearing infants who are breast- or
      formula-fed. Symptoms resolve within 48-72 h following elimination of dietary
      cow's milk protein. Most infants tolerate cow's milk by their first birthday.
      Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome presents in young formula-fed infants
      with chronic emesis, diarrhea, and failure to thrive. Reintroduction of cow's
      milk protein following a period of avoidance results in profuse, repetitive
      emesis within 2-3 h following ingestion; 20% of acute exposures may be associated
      with hypovolemic shock. Treatment of acute reactions is with vigorous hydration. 
      Most children become tolerant with age; attempts of re-introduction of milk must 
      be done under physician supervision and with secure i.v. access. Allergic
      eosinophilic gastroenteritis affects infants as well as older children and
      adolescents. Abdominal pain, emesis, diarrhea, failure to thrive, or weight loss 
      are the most common symptoms. A subset of patients may develop protein-losing
      enteropathy. Fifty percent of affected children are atopic and have evidence of
      food-specific IgE antibody but skin prick tests and serum food-IgE levels
      correlate with response to elimination diet poorly. Elemental diet based on the
      amino-acid formula leads to resolutions of gastrointestinal eosinophilic
      inflammation typically within 6 wk.

TI  - Commensal and pathogenic Escherichia coli use a common pilus adherence factor for
      epithelial cell colonization.
PG  - 10637-42
AB  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 is a food-borne pathogen that
      causes hemorrhagic colitis and the hemolytic uremic syndrome. Colonization of the
      human gut mucosa and production of potent Shiga toxins are critical virulence
      traits of EHEC. Although EHEC O157:H7 contains numerous putative pili operons,
      their role in the colonization of the natural bovine or accidental human hosts
      remains largely unknown. We have identified in EHEC an adherence factor, herein
      called E. coli common pilus (ECP), composed of a 21-kDa pilin subunit whose amino
      acid sequence corresponds to the product of the yagZ (renamed ecpA) gene present 
      in all E. coli genomes sequenced to date. ECP production was demonstrated in 121 
      (71.6%) of a total of 169 ecpA+ strains representing intestinal and
      extraintestinal pathogenic as well as normal flora E. coli. High-resolution
      ultrastructural and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated the presence of
      abundant peritrichous fibrillar structures emanating from the bacterial surface
      forming physical bridges between bacteria adhering to cultured epithelial cells. 
      Isogenic ecpA mutants of EHEC O157:H7 or fecal commensal E. coli showed
      significant reduction in adherence to cultured epithelial cells. Our data suggest
      that ECP production is a common feature of E. coli colonizing the human gut or
      other host tissues. ECP is a pilus of EHEC O157:H7 with a potential role in host 
      epithelial cell colonization and may represent a mechanism of adherence of both
      pathogenic and commensal E. coli.

TI  - Novel and future medical management of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 727-41
AB  - The treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is undergoing rapid and
      profound change. Entirely new approaches are being developed that reflect a
      greater understanding of how to control the inflammatory process. These began
      with inflixumab therapy for Crohn's disease. Additional tumor necrosis antibodies
      will soon be employed, and other biological agents are being investigated.
      Probiotics, helminth ova therapy, alternative and complementary treatments,
      leukocytophoresis, and bone-marrow and stem-cell transplantation are additional
      exciting regimens that are being explored. Although some of these approaches
      provide marked improvement in these parameters, others are unproven or fraught
      with adverse effects and complications. Still, control of ulcerative colitis and 
      Crohn's is improving with more changes likely to come.

TI  - Whole-grain consumption is associated with a reduced risk of noncardiovascular,
      noncancer death attributed to inflammatory diseases in the Iowa Women's Health
      Study.
PG  - 1606-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has recently been shown that oxidative stress, infection, and
      inflammation are predominant pathophysiologic factors for several major diseases.
      OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association of whole-grain intake with death
      attributed to noncardiovascular, noncancer inflammatory diseases. DESIGN:
      Postmenopausal women (n = 41 836) aged 55-69 y at baseline in 1986 were followed 
      for 17 y. After exclusions for cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, colitis,
      and liver cirrhosis at baseline, 27 312 participants remained, of whom 5552 died 
      during the 17 y. A proportional hazards regression model was adjusted for age,
      smoking, adiposity, education, physical activity, and other dietary factors.
      RESULTS: Inflammation-related death was inversely associated with whole-grain
      intake. Compared with the hazard ratios in women who rarely or never ate
      whole-grain foods, the hazard ratio was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.83) for those who
      consumed 4-7 servings/wk, 0.79 (0.66, 0.95) for 7.5-10.5 servings/wk, 0.64 (0.53,
      0.79) for 11-18.5 servings/wk, and 0.66 (0.54, 0.81) for >or=19 servings/wk (P
      for trend = 0.01). Previously reported inverse associations of whole-grain intake
      with total and coronary heart disease mortality persisted after 17 y of
      follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The reduction in inflammatory mortality associated with
      habitual whole-grain intake was larger than that previously reported for coronary
      heart disease and diabetes. Because a variety of phytochemicals are found in
      whole grains that may directly or indirectly inhibit oxidative stress, and
      because oxidative stress is an inevitable consequence of inflammation, we suggest
      that oxidative stress reduction by constituents of whole grain is a likely
      mechanism for the protective effect.

TI  - Nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 400-5
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Nutrition plays a significant role in the pathogenesis and
      treatment of the two major forms of inflammatory bowel disease: Crohn's disease
      and ulcerative colitis. In addition, patients with inflammatory bowel disease are
      often found to have nutrient deficiencies at the time of diagnosis, whereas
      others develop features of malnutrition over the course of their illness.
      Therefore, an understanding of the relationship between nutrients and
      inflammatory bowel disease is important if these patients are to receive optimal 
      care. RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiologic and basic research has helped to shed light 
      on the interaction between diet and the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel
      disease. Numerous clinical trials utilizing various types of lipids, including
      fish oil and short chain fatty acids, suggest that fats play an important role in
      the inflammatory response that characterizes inflammatory bowel disease. Vitamins
      and other micronutrients involved in nutrient metabolism and modulation of
      oxidative stress are also considered in this review. SUMMARY: This update
      discusses nutritional issues that can be used to help prevent and treat nutrient 
      deficiencies and ameliorate disease activity in individuals with inflammatory
      bowel disease.

TI  - Characteristic of milk whey culture with Propionibacterium freudenreichii ET-3
      and its application to the inflammatory bowel disease therapy.
PG  - 105-8
AB  - After the screening of microorganism culture, the culture of Propionibacterium
      freudenreichii ET-3 in the milk whey (milk whey culture) was found to stimulate
      the growth of our own Bifidobacteria in the colon but not the growth of other
      microorganisms. One of the active substances was identified as
      1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (DHNA).In healthy volunteers, the ingestion
      containing milk whey culture significantly increased the population of
      Bifidobacteria to total fecal bacterium. In the TNBS-induced colitis model of
      rats, milk whey culture significantly accelerated the healing of the colitis in a
      dose-dependent manner. It has been reported that DHNA inhibited the lymphocyte
      infiltration through reduction of MAdCAM-1 in DSS colitis model of mice and that 
      the ingestion of milk whey culture was effective in the treatment of ulcerative
      colitis in human pilot study. These findings suggest that milk whey culture is a 
      useful prebiotic for the therapy of inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Dietary supplementation with beta-glucan enriched oat bran increases faecal
      concentration of carboxylic acids in healthy subjects.
PG  - 978-84
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Carboxylic acids (CAs), especially butyric acid, have been 
      suggested to counteract colonic diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and colon
      cancer. Colonic formation of CAs can be influenced by the diet, but the
      concentrations and pattern formed need to be evaluated for different food
      products in humans. To elucidate how the colonic concentration of CAs in healthy 
      subjects is influenced by dietary supplementation with oat bran, and whether the 
      concentration varies over time and during consecutive days. SUBJECTS/METHODS:
      Twenty-five healthy subjects (age 24+/-1.3) were recruited to the study. The
      subjects were given 40 g beta-glucan enriched oat bran per day, corresponding to 
      20 g dietary fibre, in 4 slices of bread. CAs were analysed in faeces during
      three consecutive days after 0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks on this diet. RESULTS: The
      concentration of acetic, propionic, butyric, isobutyric and isovaleric acid was
      higher (P<0.05-0.001) after 8 weeks on the oat bran diet as compared with values 
      at entry, whereas that of lactic acid was lower (P<0.05). After 12 weeks, the
      concentrations of acetic, propionic and isobutyric acid were still higher and
      that of lactic acid lower. The variation between individuals was considerable,
      whereas in the same individuals there was little variation. CONCLUSIONS: Oat bran
      increased the faecal concentration of CAs after 8 weeks, indicating an increased 
      concentration also in the distal colon. The concentration of all main acids
      increased, except for lactic acid, which decreased. Oat bran may therefore have a
      preventive potential adjunct to colonic diseases.

TI  - Probiotics affect virulence-related gene expression in Escherichia coli O157:H7.
PG  - 4259-67
AB  - The attachment of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 (EHEC O157) to host 
      intestinal epithelial cells is essential for the development of hemorrhagic
      colitis and hemolytic-uremic syndrome in humans. Genes involved in attachment are
      carried within a pathogenicity island named the locus of enterocyte effacement
      (LEE), known to be directly activated by quorum sensing (QS). In the present
      study, we investigated autoinducer-2 (AI-2) production and the expression of
      several virulence-related genes in EHEC O157 grown in the absence and presence of
      a Lactobacillus acidophilus-secreted molecule(s). Transcription of important EHEC
      O157 virulence-related genes was studied by constructing promoter-reporter
      fusions and reverse transcriptase PCR. Shiga toxin (Stx) production was assayed
      by an enzyme immunoassay. When EHEC O157 was grown in the presence of
      chromatographically selected fractions of L. acidophilus La-5 cell-free spent
      medium, we observed a significant reduction of both extracellular AI-2
      concentration and the expression of important virulence-related genes, although
      no significant difference in Stx production was observed. We show here that L.
      acidophilus La-5 secretes a molecule(s) that either acts as a QS signal inhibitor
      or directly interacts with bacterial transcriptional regulators, controlling the 
      transcription of EHEC O157 genes involved in colonization.

TI  - Identification of commensal bacterial strains that modulate Yersinia
      enterocolitica and dextran sodium sulfate-induced inflammatory responses:
      implications for the development of probiotics.
PG  - 3490-7
AB  - An increasing body of evidence suggests that probiotic bacteria are effective in 
      the treatment of enteric infections, although the molecular basis of this
      activity remains elusive. To identify putative probiotics, we tested commensal
      bacteria in terms of their toxicity, invasiveness, inhibition of Yersinia-induced
      inflammation in vitro and in vivo, and modulation of dextran sodium sulfate
      (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. The commensal bacteria Escherichia coli,
      Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteroides distasonis, and
      Streptococcus salivarius were screened for adhesion to, invasion of, and toxicity
      for host epithelial cells (EC), and the strains were tested for their ability to 
      inhibit Y. enterocolitica-induced NF-kappaB activation. Additionally, B.
      adolescentis was administered to mice orally infected with Y. enterocolitica and 
      to mice with mucosae impaired by DSS treatment. None of the commensal bacteria
      tested was toxic for or invaded the EC. B. adolescentis, B. distasonis, B.
      vulgatus, and S. salivarius inhibited the Y. enterocolitica-induced NF-kappaB
      activation and interleukin-8 production in EC. In line with these findings, B.
      adolescentis-fed mice had significantly lower results for mean pathogen burden in
      the visceral organs, intestinal tumor necrosis factor alpha mRNA expression, and 
      loss of body weight upon oral infection with Y. enterocolitica. In addition, the 
      administration of B. adolescentis decelerated inflammation upon DSS treatment in 
      mice. We suggest that our approach might help to identify new probiotics to be
      used for the treatment of inflammatory and infectious gastrointestinal disorders.

TI  - A new iron free treatment with oral fish cartilage polysaccharide for iron
      deficiency chronic anemia in inflammatory bowel diseases: a pilot study.
PG  - 1575-8
AB  - AIM: To investigate the effect of a new oral preparation, highly concentrated in 
      fish cartilage, in a group of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) patients with
      chronic iron deficient anemia. METHODS: In an open label pilot study, we
      supple-mented a group of 25 patients (11 with Crohn's disease and 14 with
      ulcerative colitis) in stable clinical conditions and chronic anemia with a food 
      supplement which does not contain iron but contains a standardized fraction of
      fish cartilage glycosaminoglycans and a mixture of antioxidants (Captafer
      Medestea, Turin, Italy). Patients received 500 mg, twice a day during meals, for 
      at least 4 mo. Patients were suggested to maintain their alimentary habit. At
      time 0 and after 2 and 4 mo, emocrome, sideremia and ferritin were examined.
      Paired data were analyzed with Student's t test. RESULTS: Three patients relapsed
      during the study (2 in the 3rd mo, 1 in the 4th mo), two patients were lost to
      follow up and two patients dropped out (1 for orticaria, 1 for gastric burning). 
      Of the remaining 18 patients, levels of serum iron started to rapidly increase
      within the 2nd mo of treatment, P < 0.05), whereas serum ferritin and hemoglobin 
      needed a longer period to significantly improve their serum levels (mo 4) P <
      0.05. The product was safe, easy to administer and well tolerated by patients.
      CONCLUSION: These data suggest a potential new treatment for IBD patients with
      iron deficiency chronic anemia and warrant further larger controlled studies.

TI  - Crohn's disease intestinal CD4+ T cells have impaired interleukin-10 production
      which is not restored by probiotic bacteria.
PG  - 592-601
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Crohn's disease (CD) has been associated with low mucosal interleukin 
      (IL)-10 production, but the mechanism behind this deficiency remains unclear. The
      aim of this study was to investigate IL-10 and interferon (IFN)-gamma production 
      in intestinal CD4+ T cells from CD patients and healthy volunteers (HV) and to
      examine how this was affected by bacterial products and the presence or absence
      of autologous dendritic cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We cultured intestinal CD4+ 
      T cells from CD patients (n=9) and HV (n=6) and differentiated dendritic cells
      from their peripheral monocytes. Intestinal T cells were stimulated with
      Lactobacillus strains or autologous intestinal bacteria in the presence or
      absence of dendritic cells. IL-10 and IFN-gamma were measured on day 4. RESULTS: 
      When there were autologous dendritic cells present, CD intestinal T cells
      produced high levels of IFN-gamma (mean 6.4 ng/ml+/-standard error of the mean
      1.1 ng/ml) but low levels of IL-10 (0.7 ng/ml+/-0.1 ng/ml). In contrast, HV
      intestinal T cells produced less IFN-gamma (3.9 ng/ml+/-0.8 ng/ml, p=0.06) and
      more IL-10 (4.6 ng/ml+/-0.9 ng/ml, p=0.0001) than CD intestinal T cells.
      Co-culture with Lactobacilli failed to revert this imbalance in CD, but tended to
      do so in HV. When there were no dendritic cells, CD intestinal T cells responded 
      to autologous bacteria with an increased IFN-gamma production (2.3+/-1.3 ng/ml)
      compared with HV intestinal T cells (0.3+/-0.2 ng/ml). CONCLUSIONS: Crohn's
      disease intestinal CD4+ T cells display a pro-inflammatory cytokine profile with 
      impaired production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10. Tolerogenic bacteria
      (Lactobacilli) failed to restore this regulatory defect.

TI  - Advanced criteria for clinicopathological diagnosis of food protein-induced
      proctocolitis.
PG  - 213-7
AB  - The clinicopathological findings in previous studies concerning food
      protein-induced proctocolitis (FPIPC) are quite diverse in terms of results and
      conclusions. The aim of this study was to suggest advanced clinicopathological
      diagnostic criteria that facilitate the early confirmation of FPIPC. Data of 38
      FPIPC patients, who had received sigmoidoscopy and biopsy, was analyzed.
      Microscopic findings were compared with observations of previous studies. Feeding
      at onset of bleeding was exclusively breast-fed (94.7%) and formula-fed or
      mixed-fed (5.3%). Endoscopic abnormalities were observed in all patients; nodular
      hyperplasias with circumscribed and/or central pit-like erosions in 94.7% and
      erythema in 5.3%. Histopathological findings were; lymphoid aggregates in 94.7%, 
      eosinophils in lamina propria of >or=60 cells/10 HPF in 97.4% and of >20
      cells/HPF in 63.2%, epithelial or muscularis mucosa eosinophil infiltration in
      97.4%, and crypt abscess in 2.6%. The majority of FPIPC patients are exclusively 
      breast-fed and nodular hyperplasias with erosions may be a disease specific
      endoscopic finding. Histologic diagnosis of FPIPC is compatible with eosinophils 
      in the lamina propria of >or=60 cells/10 high power fields; however, >20
      cells/HPF is not an appropriate diagnostic criterion.

TI  - Effects of bacteria on the enteric nervous system: implications for the irritable
      bowel syndrome.
PG  - S7-19
AB  - A unified scenario emerges when it is considered that a major impact of stress on
      the intestinal tract is reflected by symptoms reminiscent of the
      diarrhea-predominant form of irritable bowel syndrome. Cramping abdominal pain,
      fecal urgency, and explosive watery diarrhea are hallmarks not only of
      diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome, but also of infectious enteritis, 
      radiation-induced enteritis, and food allergy. The scenario starts with
      stress-induced compromise of the intestinal mucosal barrier and continues with
      microorganisms or other sensitizing agents crossing the barrier and being
      intercepted by enteric mast cells. Mast cells signal the presence of the agent to
      the enteric nervous system (ie, the brain-in-the-gut), which uses one of the
      specialized programs from its library of programs to remove the "threat." This is
      accomplished by stimulating mucosal secretion, which flushes the threatening
      agent into the lumen and maintains it in suspension. The secretory response then 
      becomes linked to powerful propulsive motility, which propels the secretions
      together with the offending agent rapidly in the anal direction. Cramping
      abdominal pain accompanies the strong propulsive contractions. Urgency is
      experienced when arrival of the large bolus of liquid distends the recto-sigmoid 
      region and reflexly opens the internal anal sphincter, with continence protection
      now provided only by central reflexes that contract the puborectalis and external
      anal sphincter muscles. Sensory information arriving in the brain from receptors 
      in the rapidly distending recto-sigmoid accounts for the conscious sensation of
      urgency and might exacerbate the individual's emotional stress. The symptom of
      explosive watery diarrhea becomes self-explanatory in this scenario.

TI  - Dietary factors in the modulation of inflammatory bowel disease activity.
PG  - 60
AB  - CONTEXT: As patients look to complementary therapies for management of their
      diseases, it is important that the physician know the effectiveness and/or lack
      of effectiveness of a variety of dietary approaches/interventions. Although the
      pathogenesis of the inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
      disease) is not fully understood, many suspect that diet and various dietary
      factors may play a modulating role in the disease process. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: 
      The purpose of this article is to present some of what is known about various
      dietary/nutritional factors in inflammatory bowel disease, with inclusion of
      evidence from various studies regarding their putative effect. MedLINE was
      searched (1965-present) using combinations of the following search terms: diet,
      inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis.
      Additionally, references of the articles obtained were searched to identify
      further potential sources of information. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: While much
      information is available regarding various dietary interventions/supplements in
      regard to inflammatory bowel disease, the lack of controlled trials limits broad 
      applicability. Probiotics are one of the few interventions with promising results
      and controlled trials. CONCLUSION: While there are many potential and promising
      dietary factors that may play a role in the modulation of inflammatory bowel
      disease, it is prudent to await further controlled studies before broad
      application/physician recommendation in the noted patient population.

TI  - Neonatal transient eosinophilic colitis causes lower gastrointestinal bleeding in
      early infancy.
PG  - 501-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGB), particularly in newborns, is
      of serious concern and requires urgent investigation and hospital care. Whereas
      allergic proctocolitis caused by food protein is a significant cause of LGB in
      infants with eosinophilia, there are several cases of diseases with symptoms
      similar to those of allergic proctocolitis but without an apparent allergic
      reaction influence. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined 2 neonates using
      rectosigmoidoscopy who showed eosinophilia and experienced fresh LGB soon after
      birth and before their first feedings. Serum eosinic cationic protein (ECP) and
      platelet activating factor (PAF) levels were also examined in the second case to 
      confirm the involvement of eosinophils for its pathogenesis. RESULTS: Both
      patients were in a clinically stable condition, and their abdomens were soft. The
      results of their blood analyses, abdominal radiographs, and stool cultures were
      normal, but they had gross eosinophilia: the eosinophil counts were 9014/mm3
      (patient 1) and 1955/mm3 (patient 2). Rectosigmoidoscopy with colonic mucosal
      biopsy revealed nodular lymphoid hyperplasia with a pale mucosal surface and
      massive oozing with diffuse eosinophilic infiltration in the lamina propria. In
      patient 2 the serum ECP and PAF levels were elevated to 123 microg/L (normal,
      <14.7) and 13.1 micromol/L/min (normal, <6). A few days after intravenous
      hydration therapy, LGB was no longer detected, and the serum ECP and PAF levels
      returned to normal. CONCLUSIONS: Inasmuch as these infants had LGB similar to
      allergic proctocolitis without any allergic reactions, we suggest that
      infiltrated eosinophils in the colonic mucosa could be involved in the
      pathogenesis of LGB in early infancy.

TI  - The effect of nicotine in vitro on the integrity of tight junctions in Caco-2
      cell monolayers.
PG  - 1593-8
AB  - Ulcerative colitis is characterised by impairment of the epithelial barrier and
      tight junction alterations resulting in increased intestinal permeability. UC is 
      less common in smokers with smoking reported to decrease paracellular
      permeability. The aim of this study was thus to determine the effect of nicotine,
      the major constituent in cigarettes and its metabolites on the integrity of tight
      junctions in Caco-2 cell monolayers. The integrity of Caco-2 tight junctions was 
      analysed by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and by
      tracing the flux of the fluorescent marker fluorescein, after treatment with
      various concentrations of nicotine or nicotine metabolites over 48 h. TER was
      significantly higher compared to the control for all concentrations of nicotine
      0.01-10 microM at 48 h (p<0.001), and for 0.01 microM (p<0.001) and 0.1 microM
      and 10 microM nicotine (p < 0.01) at 12 and 24 h. The fluorescein flux results
      supported those of the TER assay. TER readings for all nicotine metabolites
      tested were also higher at 24 and 48 h only (p < or = 0.01). Western blot
      analysis demonstrated that nicotine up-regulated the expression of the tight
      junction proteins occludin and claudin-1 (p < or = 0.01). Overall, it appears
      that nicotine and its metabolites, at concentrations corresponding to those
      reported in the blood of smokers, can significantly improve tight junction
      integrity, and thus, decrease epithelial gut permeability. We have shown that in 
      vitro, nicotine appears more potent than its metabolites in decreasing epithelial
      gut permeability. We speculate that this enhanced gut barrier may be the result
      of increased expression of claudin-1 and occludin proteins, which are associated 
      with the formation of tight junctions. These findings may help explain the
      mechanism of action of nicotine treatment and indeed smoking in reducing
      epithelial gut permeability.

TI  - [Ileo pouch-anal anastomosis].
PG  - 606-11
AB  - Restorative proctocolectomy with an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is the treatment
      of choice in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and familial adenomatous
      polyposis requiring surgical therapy. Pouchitis is the most frequent
      complication, occurring in up to 50% of patients with underlying UC. Clinical
      symptoms of the disease are non-specific. Moreover, surgical complications must
      be differentiated from idiopathic pouchitis using pouchoscopy, endoscopic
      ultrasound or MRI of the pelvis in certain cases. The therapy for idiopathic
      pouchitis, its etiology and pathophysiology being unclear, is based on antibiotic
      treatment, usually with metronidazole or ciprofloxacin. Probiotics such as VSL#3 
      can be used to prevent relapse. In summary, the clinical and functional outcomes 
      are excellent and stable for 20 years after surgery.

TI  - [Ischemic colitis without atherosclerosis?].
PG  - 667-70
AB  - HISTORY AND CLINICAL FINDINGS: A 69-year-old woman, who was being treated for a
      bipolar affective psychosis, was admitted because of abdominal pain, emesis and
      bloody stool. EXAMINATIONS: Blood tests showed increased inflammation parameters.
      Ultrasound revealed a swollen intestinal wall. Coloscopy correlated with the
      ultrasound findings and demonstrated an ischemic colitis. The histological report
      at first corroborated this as the possible diagnosis. But angiography of the
      mesenteric vessels and duplex ultrasound of the cervical vessels were normal.
      COURSE AND THERAPY: The symptoms persisted under therapy with acetylsalicylic
      acid (100 mg daily), no food intake and intravenous fluids. The coloscopic
      picture and the laboratory tests remained unchanged. The findings did not
      normalize until most of the antipsychotic drugs, especially perazine, were
      discontinued. The angiographic and duplexultrasound results spoke against the
      initially suspected diagnosis of an ischemic origin, but for necrotizing colitis 
      as an adverse effect of perazine. A second biopsy confirmed this explanation.
      CONCLUSION: A necrotizing colitis as an adverse effect of drugs can simulate an
      ischemic colitis on endoscopy and in a biopsy. Even if the clinical pattern is
      present possible adverse reaction to the medication should be considered. The
      diagnosis of a necrotizing colitis was postulated only after the course of the
      disease had been taken into account and, in particular, atherosclerosis had been 
      excluded as a possible cause, and an adverse reaction to the medication had been 
      considered.

TI  - A key role of dendritic cells in probiotic functionality.
PG  - e313
AB  - BACKGROUND: Disruption of the intestinal homeostasis and tolerance towards the
      resident microbiota is a major mechanism involved in the development of
      inflammatory bowel disease. While some bacteria are inducers of disease, others, 
      known as probiotics, are able to reduce inflammation. Because dendritic cells
      (DCs) play a central role in regulating immune responses and in inducing
      tolerance, we investigated their role in the anti-inflammatory potential of
      probiotic lactic acid bacteria. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Selected LAB
      strains, while efficiently taken up by DCs in vitro, induced a partial maturation
      of the cells. Transfer of probiotic-treated DCs conferred protection against 2,
      4, 6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis. Protection was
      associated with a reduction of inflammatory scores and colonic expression of
      pro-inflammatory genes, while a high local expression of the immunoregulatory
      enzyme indolamine 2, 3 dioxgenase (IDO) was observed. The preventive effect of
      probiotic-pulsed DCs required not only MyD88-, TLR2- and NOD2-dependent signaling
      but also the induction of CD4+ CD25+ regulatory cells in an IL-10-independent
      pathway. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Altogether, these results suggest that
      selected probiotics can stimulate DC regulatory functions by targeting specific
      pattern-recognition receptors and pathways. The results not only emphasize the
      role of DCs in probiotic immune interactions, but indicate a possible role in
      immune-intervention therapy for IBD.

AB  - Standard treatment for IBD with 5-ASA, steroids and immunosuppressants is rather 
      effective and currently optimized using combinations of drugs or application
      routes. Among the biologics only infliximab has reached the therapeutic arsenal
      for Crohn's disease--it is as well effective in some patients with ulcerative
      colitis. Early aggressive treatment thus far is not established. Hormones and
      growth factors may play a role. Probiotics have a place in the treatment in
      particular for ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Isolation and characterisation of new putative probiotic bacteria from human
      colonic flora.
PG  - 725-34
AB  - The present study describes a novel bacterial isolate exhibiting high ability to 
      synthesise and secrete butyrate. The novel isolated bacterium was obtained from
      human faeces and grown in selective liquid intestinal microflora medium
      containing rumen fluid under microaerobic conditions. Its probiotic properties
      were demonstrated by the ability of the isolate to survive high acidity and
      medium containing bile acids and the ability to adhere to colon cancer cells
      (Caco-2) in vitro. Phylogenetic identity to Enterococcus durans was established
      using specific primers for 16S rRNA (99% probability). PCR analyses with primers 
      to the bacterial gene encoding butyrate kinase, present in the butyrogenic
      bacteria Clostridium, showed that this gene is present in E. durans. The in vivo 
      immunoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of E. durans were assessed in
      dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in Balb/c mice. Administration of E.
      durans ameliorated histological, clinical and biochemical scores directly related
      to intestinal inflammation whereas the lactic acid bacterium Lactobacillus
      delbrueckii was ineffective in this regard. Colonic cDNA concentrations of
      IL-1beta and TNF-alpha were significantly down regulated in DSS-treated E.
      durans-fed mice but not in control or DSS-treated L. delbrueckii- fed mice.
      Fluorescent in situ hybridisation analyses of colonic tissue from mice fed E.
      durans, using a butyrate kinase probe, demonstrated that E. durans significantly 
      adheres to the colonic tissue. The novel isolated bacterium described in the
      present paper, upon further characterisation, can be developed into a useful
      probiotic aimed at the treatment of patients suffering from ulcerative colitis.

TI  - [Changes in the epidemiology of inflammatory bowel diseases].
PG  - 223-8
AB  - Significant changes have been observed in the epidemiology of inflammatory bowel 
      diseases (IBD) in the last two decades. Traditionally, the incidence of IBD was
      higher in the developed, industrialized countries, in contrast, nowadays it
      became more prevalent in the previously low incidence areas. In particular, the
      incidence of ulcerative colitis (UC) is similar to that observed in North America
      and Western Europe, while the incidence of Crohn's disease (CD) in developing
      countries is still low, suggesting that the environmental factors may act faster 
      or differently in UC than in CD. In Europe, the North to South gradient
      disappeared, and also the West to East gradient is diminishing. Smoking and
      appendectomy may be considered as important environmental factors in both UC and 
      CD, however, with opposite effects. In addition, the use of oral contraceptives
      is associated to disease susceptibility in both diseases. The role of diet,
      perinatal events, stress and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the
      pathogenesis is still controversial.

TI  - Association between gastric acid suppressants and Clostridium difficile colitis
      and community-acquired pneumonia: analysis using pharmacovigilance tools.
PG  - 417-22
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recent epidemiological studies identifying an association between some
      classes of gastric acid suppressants and Clostridium difficile colitis and
      community-acquired pneumonia prompted our analysis. Our objective was to
      retrospectively apply data mining algorithms (DMAs) to the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) drug safety database to see if they might have
      directed/redirected attention to the reported association of gastric acid
      suppressive drugs with C. difficile colitis and community-acquired pneumonia,
      prior to the published epidemiological findings that supported the association.
      DESIGN: Two statistical DMAs, proportional reporting ratios (PRRs) and multi-item
      gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS), were applied to a spontaneous reporting system
      (SRS) database to identify signals of disproportionate reporting (SDRs). RESULTS:
      SDRs related to community-acquired pneumonia were observed for two proton pump
      inhibitors (lansoprazole and omeprazole), two H2 antagonists (famotidine and
      roxatidine), and one antacid (magnesium silicate hydroxide). For C. difficile
      colitis, an SDR was generated for one proton pump inhibitor (lansoprazole).
      CONCLUSIONS: Although our analysis suggests that there may be an association
      between the SDRs using SRS data and the epidemiological findings, these results
      may not have alerted public health professionals in advance of published studies 
      to an association between proton pump inhibitors/gastric acid suppressants and C.
      difficile colitis or community-acquired pneumonia. However, the analysis reveals 
      the potential utility of DMAs to direct attention to more subtle indirect drug
      adverse effects in SRS databases that as yet are often identified from
      epidemiological investigations.

AB  - Patients with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea often present in the acute
      setting to the emergency department for evaluation. After the appropriate
      clinical assessment, cross-sectional imaging is often utilized to evaluate for
      the severity of the disease. Although a wide spectrum of findings may be seen,
      diffuse colonic mural thickening, consistent with pancolitis, is most common. We

TI  - Psyllium as therapeutic and drug delivery agent.
PG  - 1-14
AB  - There is no doubt that fibers, in particular viscous dietary fibers, have
      positive effects on human health, both in the prevention and in treatment of
      chronic diseases. Dietary fibers from psyllium have been used extensively both as
      pharmacological supplements, food ingredients, in processed food to aid weight
      control, to regulation of glucose control for diabetic patients and reducing
      serum lipid levels in hyperlipidemics. Keeping in view, the pharmacological
      importance of psyllium polysaccharide and its gel-forming nature, this article
      discusses the therapeutic value of psyllium for the treatment of constipation,
      diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease-ulcerative
      colitis, colon cancer, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia and exploitation of
      psyllium for developing drug delivery systems.

TI  - [Pre- and probiotics].
PG  - 161-9
AB  - Nowadays, the regular consumption of pre- and probiotics is recommended to
      provide various positive health benefits. The in vitro and in vivo demonstrated
      actions on the intestinal microflora, the mucosal barrier and the immunological
      system are very interesting to propose beneficial health effects, but the
      scientific proof in humans is not demonstrated yet. Pre- and probiotics are very 
      active in the intestinal tract (mainly in the colon) by maintaining a healthy gut
      microflora and influencing metabolic, trophic and protective mechanism.
      Prebiotics stimulates the growth of apathogen bacteria and increase the short
      chain fatty acid concentration by fermentation. Short chain fatty acids are
      necessary substrates for a healthy gut. Probiotics inhibit the growth of pathogen
      bacteria, reduce the translocation of bacteria and toxins and modulate the
      intestinal immune system. For some specific clinical diseases (ulcerative
      colitis, pouchitis, diarrhoea) a therapeutic and prophylactic effect with pre-
      and probiotics was shown. In the near future more indications for pre- and
      probiotics (used as a single strain or as in a combination) will be added.
      Promising results are already shown in irritable bowel syndrome, prevention of
      antibiotic induced diarrhoea, in surgical and in intensive care patients. Future 
      studies should focus to determine the characteristics of a healthy gut and the
      evaluation of specific health benefits by well-designed, controlled human studies
      of adequate duration.

TI  - A family outbreak of Escherichia coli O157 haemorrhagic colitis caused by pork
      meat salami.
PG  - 311-4
AB  - A family outbreak of Escherichia coli O157 infection was microbiologically
      associated with consumption of dry-fermented salami made with pork meat only and 
      produced in a local plant. E. coli O157 strains isolated from a wife and husband,
      both hospitalized with bloody diarrhoea, and from the salami carried vt1, vt2 and
      eae genes and shared the same PFGE pattern. The food vehicle implicated in this
      outbreak is unusual because of both the animal species from which it originates
      and the fermentation and drying steps of the manufacturing process. This could be
      the first report of an outbreak associated with a product containing pork meat
      only. Even though sources of contamination other than pork meat could not be
      excluded, pork products should not be neglected in E. coli O157 outbreak
      investigations.

TI  - High proportions of proinflammatory bacteria on the colonic mucosa in a young
      patient with ulcerative colitis as revealed by cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA
      genes.
PG  - 620-7
AB  - The pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC) remains unknown. It is thought to be 
      due to an abnormal and uncontrolled immune response to normally occurring
      constituents of the intestine. Microbial agents appear to be involved in the
      pathogenesis and intestinal bacteria seem to be an important factor in the
      development and chronicity. The aim of this study was to investigate the colonic 
      microbiota of a patient with UC. The colonic tissues were taken during surgery
      from a 12-year-old girl suffering from UC. The microbiota on the colonic samples 
      was studied by cloning and sequencing of amplified 16S rRNA genes. Compared with 
      healthy subjects, alteration of the dominant bacterial group was observed in the 
      UC patient. We found a high incidence of Enterobacteriaceae, Bacteroides
      fragilis, and the single phylotype of the Faecalibacterium prausnitzii-like
      "Butyrate-producing bacterium" L2-6. Furthermore, there was a substantial
      presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the present case of UC. The high proportion
      of adverse proinflammatory species is striking in the present case compared with 
      more normal situations. Even if those bacteria are not the cause of the UC, they 
      most probably enhance the symptoms of the disease.

TI  - Spotlight on VSL#3 probiotic mixture in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 61-3
AB  - VSL#3 (VSL#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live
      freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human
      gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli
      (Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, and L. delbrueckii subsp.
      bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium longum, B. breve,
      and B. infantis), and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. Data from
      noncomparative trials suggest that VSL#3 has clinical potential in the treatment 
      of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for
      patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. In addition, a randomized,
      open-label, multicenter trial showed that VSL#3 in combination with low-dose
      balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was
      more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the
      treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled studies have shown VSL#3 is effective in preventing the onset 
      of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in
      maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in
      patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. Treatment
      guidelines from the US and the UK include VSL#3 as a therapeutic option for the
      prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. In general,
      VSL#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. Large, well designed, controlled
      confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of VSL#3 in the
      treatment of ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Correlation between in vitro and in vivo immunomodulatory properties of lactic
      acid bacteria.
PG  - 236-43
AB  - AIM: To investigate the correlation between in vitro and in vivo immunomodulation
      potential of the probiotic strain and its ability to prevent experimental colitis
      in mice. METHODS: In vitro immunomodulation was assessed by measuring interleukin
      (IL)-12p70, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interferon gamma
      (IFNgamma) release by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after 24 h
      stimulation with 13 live bacterial strains. A murine model of acute TNBS-colitis 
      was next used to evaluate the prophylactic protective capacity of the same set of
      strains. RESULTS: A strain-specific in vivo protection was observed. The strains 
      displaying an in vitro potential to induce higher levels of the anti-inflammatory
      cytokine IL-10 and lower levels of the inflammatory cytokine IL-12, offered the
      best protection in the in vivo colitis model. In contrast, strains leading to a
      low IL-10/IL-12 cytokine ratio could not significantly attenuate colitis
      symptoms. CONCLUSION: These results show that we could predict the in vivo
      protective capacity of the studied lactic acid bacteria (LAB) based on the
      cytokine profile we established in vitro. The PBMC-based assay we used may thus
      serve as a useful primary indicator to narrow down the number of candidate

TI  - Therapeutic effectiveness of orally administered transgenic low-alkaloid tobacco 
      expressing human interleukin-10 in a mouse model of colitis.
PG  - 50-9
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents a spectrum of diseases in which
      inflammation leads to acute and chronic gut injury. It is a growing health issue 
      for which no cure exists. The pathogenesis is multifactorial with links to
      infectious and environmental events that trigger disease in genetically
      predisposed individuals. Treatment of the two major forms of IBD, Crohn's disease
      and ulcerative colitis, involves the reduction of inflammation with toxic
      immunosuppressive drugs or blocking of the pro-inflammatory effects of tumour
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) with antibodies. Here, we show that the oral
      administration of transgenic low-alkaloid tobacco expressing the
      contra-inflammatory cytokine human interleukin-10 (hIL-10) reduces the severity
      of colitis by down-regulating TNF-alpha expression directly at the sites of
      inflammation in IBD-susceptible IL-10(-/-) mice. hIL-10 expressed in plants is
      biologically active and displays resistance to gastrointestinal degradation.
      Dietary supplementation with plant tissue delivering up to 9 microg of hIL-10
      daily for 4 weeks was well tolerated by treated mice. Gut histology was
      significantly improved relative to controls (P = 0.002), and was correlated with 
      a decrease in small bowel TNF-alpha mRNA levels and an increase in IL-2 and
      IL-1beta mRNA levels. Transgenic plants expressing IL-10 to directly attenuate
      TNF-alpha expression at sites of inflammation in the gut may become a useful new 
      approach in the luminal therapy of IBD.

TI  - Multicenter randomized-controlled clinical trial of probiotics (Lactobacillus
      johnsonii, LA1) on early endoscopic recurrence of Crohn's disease after
      lleo-caecal resection.
PG  - 135-42
AB  - BACKGROUND: Seventy percent of Crohn's disease (CD) patients exhibit anastomotic 
      recurrence within 1 year after ileo-caecal surgery. Recent clinical trials
      suggest the beneficial use of probiotics in the control of intestinal
      inflammation in pouchitis and ulcerative colitis. This study is a multicenter
      clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of an oral administration of the probiotic
      LAl on early post-operative endoscopic recurrence of CD. METHODS: Seventy
      patients with CD were enrolled prior to elective ileo-caecal resection and
      randomly assigned after surgery to daily treatment with either Lactobacillus
      johnsonii, LA1, Nestle (1010 colony-forming units, CFU) (group A, n = 34) or
      placebo (group B, n = 36) for 12 weeks. The primary objective was to assess the
      effect of LAl on the endoscopic recurrence rate at 12 weeks. Stratification was
      performed according to smoking status at randomization. RESULTS: Seven and 14
      patients were excluded in the LA1 and placebo groups, respectively. In
      intention-to-treat analysis, the mean endoscopic score was not significantly
      different between the two treatment groups at 3 months (LA1 versus placebo: 1.50 
      +/- 1.32 versus 1.22+/-1.37, treatment effect: P = 0.48, smoke effect: P = 0.72).
      The percentage of patients with severe recurrence (i3 + i4) was 21% and 15% in
      the LAl and placebo groups, respectively (P = 0.33). Using a per-protocol (PP)
      analysis, the mean endoscopic score was not significantly different between the
      two treatment groups (LAl versus placebo groups: 1.44 +/-1.31 versus 1.05 +/-
      1.21, P = 0.32). The percentage of patients with severe recurrence (i3 + i4) was 
      19% and 9% in the LAl and placebo groups, respectively (P = 0.054). Clinical
      relapse rate (CDAI [CD activity index] > 150, with an increase of CDAI > 70
      points or greater from baseline) in the LAl and placebo groups was 15% (4/27) and
      13.5% (3/22), respectively (PP analysis: chi-square test, P = 0.91 and log-rank
      test: P = 0.79). CONCLUSION: Oral administration of the probiotic LA1 in patients
      with CD failed to prevent early endoscopic recurrence at 12 weeks after
      ileo-caecal resection.

TI  - Hypothesis about mechanisms through which nicotine might exert its effect on the 
      interdependence of inflammation and gut barrier function in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 108-15
AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) is characterized by impairment of the epithelial barrier 
      and the formation of ulcer-type lesions, which result in local leaks and
      generalized alterations of mucosal tight junctions. Ultimately, this results in
      increased basal permeability. Although disruption of the epithelial barrier in
      the gut is a hallmark of inflammatory bowel disease and intestinal infections, it
      remains unclear whether barrier breakdown is an initiating event of UC or rather 
      a consequence of an underlying inflammation, evidenced by increased production of
      proinflammatory cytokines. UC is less common in smokers, suggesting that the
      nicotine in cigarettes may ameliorate disease severity. The mechanism behind this
      therapeutic effect is still not fully understood, and indeed it remains unclear
      if nicotine is the true protective agent in cigarettes. Nicotine is metabolized
      in the body into a variety of metabolites and can also be degraded to form
      various breakdown products. It is possible these metabolites or degradation
      products may be the true protective or curative agents. A greater understanding
      of the pharmacodynamics and kinetics of nicotine in relation to the immune system
      and enhanced knowledge of gut permeability defects in UC are required to
      establish the exact protective nature of nicotine and its metabolites in UC. This
      review suggests possible hypotheses for the protective mechanism of nicotine in
      UC, highlighting the relationship between gut permeability and inflammation, and 
      indicates where in the pathogenesis of the disease nicotine may mediate its
      effect.

TI  - Infective disorders of the gastrointestinal tract.
PG  - 55-63
AB  - Gastrointestinal infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality
      worldwide. Infectious organisms are often recovered by microbiological methods,
      but surgical pathologists may play a very valuable role in diagnosis. This review
      will focus on infective disorders of the gastrointestinal tract with an emphasis 
      on enterocolitides caused by food- and water-borne pathogens. Diagnostic
      histological features of selected enteric infections will be emphasized,
      including those that mimic other inflammatory conditions of the gut (such as
      ischaemia or idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease), along with available
      diagnostic methods that can aid in diagnosis.

TI  - Differences in yeast intolerance between patients with Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 83-8
AB  - PURPOSE: Alimentary factors, especially those modifying the intestinal flora, may
      influence the course of inflammatory bowel disease. It is known that T and B
      cells of patients with Crohn's disease can be stimulated with the yeast antigen, 
      mannan. We evaluated the impact of eating habits with special respect to food
      containing yeast on the course of inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS:
      Questionnaires were sent to 180 German-speaking patients of the Inflammatory
      Bowel Disease Outpatient Clinic at the University Hospital Bern, Switzerland. The
      following information was obtained by the questionnaires: (1) course of disease, 
      (2) eating habits, (3) environmental data, and (4) inflammatory bowel disease
      questionnaire. The survey was anonymous. RESULTS: A total of 145 patients (80.5
      percent 95 with Crohn's disease, and 50 with ulcerative colitis) responded. Food 
      items containing yeast were better tolerated by patients with ulcerative colitis 
      than by patients with Crohn's disease. A significant difference between the two
      groups was observed concerning food containing raw yeast (dough, P = 0.04; and
      pastry, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Food items containing raw yeast led to more
      frequent problems for patients with Crohn's disease than for patients with
      ulcerative colitis. This observation supports our previous data, which showed the
      stimulatory effect of the yeast antigen, mannan, on B and T cells of patients
      with Crohn's disease but not of controls.

TI  - Carrageenan induces interleukin-8 production through distinct Bcl10 pathway in
      normal human colonic epithelial cells.
PG  - G829-38
AB  - Carrageenan is a high molecular weight sulfated polygalactan used to improve the 
      texture of commercial food products. Its use increased markedly during the last
      half century, although carrageenan is known to induce inflammation in
      rheumatological models and in intestinal models of colitis. We performed studies 
      to determine its direct effects on human intestinal cells, including normal human
      intestinal epithelial cells from colonic surgeries, the normal intestinal
      epithelial cell line NCM460, and normal rat ileal epithelial cells. Cells were
      treated with high molecular weight lambda-carrageenan at a concentration of 1
      mug/ml for 1-96 h. IL-8, IL-8 promoter activity, total and nuclear NF-kappaB,
      IkappaBalpha, phospho-IkappaBalpha, and Bcl10 were assessed by
      immunohistochemistry, Western blot, ELISA, and cDNA microarray. Increased Bcl10, 
      nuclear and cytoplasmic NF-kappaB, IL-8 promoter activation, and IL-8 secretion
      were detected following carrageenan exposure. Knockdown of Bcl10 by siRNA
      markedly reduced the increase in IL-8 that followed carrageenan exposure in the
      NCM460 cells. These results show, for the first time, that exposure of human
      intestinal epithelial cells to carrageenan triggers a distinct inflammatory
      pathway via activation of Bcl10 with NF-kappaB activation and upregulation of
      IL-8 secretion. Since Bcl10 contains a caspase-recruitment domain, similar to
      that found in NOD2/CARD15 and associated with genetic predisposition to Crohn's
      disease, the study findings may represent a link between genetic and
      environmental etiologies of inflammatory bowel disease. Because of the high use
      of carrageenan as a food additive in the diet, the findings may have clinical
      significance.

TI  - Prevalence and pathogenicity of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli in beef
      cattle and their products.
PG  - E63-72
AB  - During the past 23 yr, a large number of human illness outbreaks have been traced
      worldwide to consumption of undercooked ground beef and other beef products
      contaminated with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC). Although several
      routes exist for human infection with STEC, beef remains a main source. Thus,
      beef cattle are considered reservoirs of O157 and nonO157 STEC. Because of the
      global nature of the food supply, safety concerns with beef will continue, and
      the challenges facing the beef industry will increase at the production and
      processing levels. To be prepared to address these concerns and challenges, it is
      critical to assess the beef cattle role in human infection with STEC. Because
      most STEC outbreaks in the United States were traced to beef containing E. coli
      O157:H7, the epidemiological studies have focused on the prevalence of this
      serotype in beef and beef cattle. Worldwide, however, additional STEC serotypes
      (e.g., members of the O26, O91, O103, O111, O118, O145, and O166 serogroups) have
      been isolated from beef and caused human illnesses ranging from bloody diarrhea
      and hemorrhagic colitis to the life-threatening hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). 
      To provide a global assessment of the STEC problem, published reports on beef and
      beef cattle in the past 3 decades were evaluated. The prevalence rates of E. coli
      O157 ranged from 0.1 to 54.2% in ground beef, from 0.1 to 4.4% in sausage, from
      1.1 to 36.0% in various retail cuts, and from 0.01 to 43.4% in whole carcasses.
      The corresponding prevalence rates of nonO157 STEC were 2.4 to 30.0%, 17.0 to
      49.2%, 11.4 to 49.6%, and 1.7 to 58.0%, respectively. Of the 162 STEC serotypes
      isolated from beef products, 43 were detected in HUS patients and 36 are known to
      cause other human illnesses. With regard to beef cattle, the prevalence rates of 
      E. coli O157 ranged from 0.3 to 19.7% in feedlots and from 0.7 to 27.3% on
      pasture. The corresponding prevalence rates of nonO157 STEC were 4.6 to 55.9% and
      4.7 to 44.8%, respectively. Of the 373 STEC serotypes isolated from cattle feces 
      or hides, 65 were detected in HUS patients and 62 are known to cause other human 
      illnesses. The results indicated the prevalence of a large number of pathogenic
      STEC in beef and beef cattle at high rates and emphasized the critical need for
      control measures to assure beef safety.

TI  - Successful bone marrow transplantation for IPEX syndrome after reduced-intensity 
      conditioning.
PG  - 383-5
AB  - Immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX) syndrome
      is a rare, fatal autoimmune disorder caused by mutations in the FOXP3 gene
      leading to the disruption of signaling pathways involved in regulatory
      T-lymphocyte function. Lifelong multiagent immunosuppression is necessary to
      control debilitating autoimmune manifestations such as colitis and food
      allergies. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can restore 
      T-cell regulatory function but has been previously associated with poor outcome. 
      We describe successful HSCT in 4 patients with IPEX syndrome using a novel
      reduced-intensity conditioning regimen that resulted in stable donor engraftment,
      reconstitution of FOXP3+ T regulatory CD4+ cells, and amelioration of
      gastrointestinal symptoms.

TI  - Toxin A-negative, toxin B-positive Clostridium difficile.
PG  - 5-10
AB  - Clostridium difficile is a major cause of infectious diarrhea in hospitalized
      patients. Many pathogenic strains of Clostridium difficile produce two toxins
      TcdA and TcdB, both of which are pro-inflammatory and enterotoxic in human
      intestine. Clinically relevant toxin A-negative, toxin B-positive (A(-)B(+))
      strains of Clostridium difficile that cause diarrhea and colitis in humans have
      been isolated with increasing frequency worldwide. This perspective describes
      these important toxin variant strains and highlights the need to use Clostridium 
      difficile diagnostic methods that can detect both TcdA and TcdB.
