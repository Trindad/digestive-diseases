TI  - [Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders].
PG  - 1430-1433
AB  - The term << eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders >> describes a group of
      diseases that comprises eosinophilic esophagitis, gastritis, enteritis, and
      colitis. Eosinophilic esophagitis is the most prevalent form while eosinophilic
      gastritis, enteritis, and colitis are rare. Food antigens have increasingly been 
      found to trigger the inflammatory response. This review will highlight the
      epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnostic modalities and therapeutic
      options of eosinophilic gastritis, enteritis, and colitis.

TI  - Review-Ulcerative colitis and probiotics: An overview.
PG  - 1877-1880
AB  - Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the large intestine whose
      effects are bloody diarrhea, cramping and bloating. The disease is usually
      relapsing and remitting. However, the cause of ulcerative colitis is not yet
      known. Due to this reason, finding an effective treatment has been a great
      challenge. The suggested medical treatment is usually composed of two portions;
      keeping the flare up from happening and treating the flare up when it has
      happened. Active flare ups are treated with corticosteroids. There are several
      hypothesis which suggest that ulcerative colitis could be due to the micro flora 
      present in gut. For this reason, several researchers tried to modify the gut
      microflora with probiotics. However, there is no probiotics found that can induce
      emission faster than the placebo. The ulcerative colitis patients taking
      probiotics showed fewer and less severe symptoms during the flare up. This means 
      that even though the probiotics did not end up the flare up faster, it slowed up 
      the severity of the symptoms of the patients.

AB  - In cystic fibrosis (CF), approximately 5-8% of the patients develop multilobular 
      cirrhosis during the first decade of life. Annual screening (clinical
      examination, liver biochemistry, ultrasonography) is recommended in order to
      identify early signs of liver involvement, initiate ursodeoxycholic acid therapy 
      and detect complications (portal hypertension and liver failure). Management
      should focus on nutrition and prevention of variceal bleeding. The gut may also
      be involved in children with CF. Gastroesophageal reflux is frequent, although
      often neglected and should be investigated by pH monitoring and impedancemetry,
      if available. Acute pancreatitis occurs in patients with persistent exocrine
      pancreatic activity. Intussusception, appendicular mucocele, distal intestinal
      occlusion syndrome, small bowel bacterial overgrowth and Clostridium difficile
      colitis should be considered in case of abdominal pain. Preventive nutritional
      support should be started as soon as possible after diagnosis of CF. Attainment
      of normal growth is one of the main goals and can be achieved with hypercaloric
      and salt supplemented food. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy should be
      started as soon as exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is confirmed and ingested
      immediately prior to meals with intake of fat-soluble vitamins. Curative
      nutritional interventions are more likely to be effective in the early stages of 
      pulmonary disease. Feeding disorders, related to the physiopathology and the
      psychologic aspects of the disease are frequent. Repeated corporeal aggressions, 
      associated with inappropriate medical and parental pressure, may increase the
      child's refusal of food. The multidisciplinary team should guide parents in order
      to avoid all intrusive feeding practices and promote pleasant mealtimes.

AB  - AIM: Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are two important chronic
      Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) characterized by prominent intestinal
      inflammation. Probiotics are the bacteria that promote the host health by its
      immunomodulatory activity. The present study investigated the correlation between
      in vitro adhesion and immunomodulatory properties, and to assess the therapeutic 
      potential of Bifidobacterium bifidum 231 (BIF 231), a new strain of probiotic in 
      ulcerative colitis in rats. METHODS: In vitro adhesion assays and
      immunomodulatory effect of BIF 231 on interleukins (IL-1beta and IL-10) in IEC-6 
      cell lines were quantified by gram staining, scanning electron microscopy and
      q-PCR respectively. Colitis was induced by intra-rectal instillation of
      trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid. Colitis was evaluated by alterations in colon gross
      morphology, histologically and biochemically. Colonic interleukin-1beta
      (IL-1beta) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) mRNA and protein expression were assessed
      by q-PCR, ELISA and western blot. RESULTS: BIF 231 showed better adhesion and
      immunomodulation by up-regulating IL-10 levels in IEC-6 cell lines. In vivo
      studies with treatment of BIF 231 (1.4x10(11) CFU/rat/day) revealed
      anti-inflammatory effects both macroscopically and histologically. BIF 231
      lowered TBARS, nitric oxide and augmented GSH levels. BIF 231 treatment to
      colitic rats down regulated IL-1beta levels with concurrent increase in IL-10
      levels. CONCLUSIONS: BIF 231 exerted beneficial in vitro adhesion and
      immunomodulatory properties which facilitated the recovery of the damaged tissue 
      in TNBS-induced colitis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The ESPEN guideline presents a multidisciplinary focus on clinical 
      nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODOLOGY: The guideline is
      based on extensive systematic review of the literature, but relies on expert
      opinion when objective data were lacking or inconclusive. The conclusions and 64 
      recommendations have been subject to full peer review and a Delphi process in
      which uniformly positive responses (agree or strongly agree) were required.
      RESULTS: IBD is increasingly common and potential dietary factors in its
      aetiology are briefly reviewed. Malnutrition is highly prevalent in IBD -
      especially in Crohn's disease. Increased energy and protein requirements are
      observed in some patients. The management of malnutrition in IBD is considered
      within the general context of support for malnourished patients. Treatment of
      iron deficiency (parenterally if necessary) is strongly recommended. Routine
      provision of a special diet in IBD is not however supported. Parenteral nutrition
      is indicated only when enteral nutrition has failed or is impossible. The
      recommended perioperative management of patients with IBD undergoing surgery
      accords with general ESPEN guidance for patients having abdominal surgery.
      Probiotics may be helpful in UC but not Crohn's disease. Primary therapy using
      nutrition to treat IBD is not supported in ulcerative colitis, but is moderately 
      well supported in Crohn's disease, especially in children where the adverse
      consequences of steroid therapy are proportionally greater. However, exclusion
      diets are generally not recommended and there is little evidence to support any
      particular formula feed when nutritional regimens are constructed. CONCLUSIONS:
      Available objective data to guide nutritional support and primary nutritional
      therapy in IBD are presented as 64 recommendations, of which 9 are very strong
      recommendations (grade A), 22 are strong recommendations (grade B) and 12 are
      based only on sparse evidence (grade 0); 21 recommendations are good practice
      points (GPP).

TI  - Measurement of in vivo Gastrointestinal Release and Dissolution of Three Locally 
      Acting Mesalamine Formulations in Regions of the Human Gastrointestinal Tract.
PG  - 345-358
LID - 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.6b00641 [doi]
AB  - As an orally administered, locally acting gastrointestinal drug, mesalamine
      products are designed to achieve high local drug concentration in the
      gastrointestinal (GI) tract for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. The aim of
      this study was to directly measure and compare drug dissolution of three
      mesalamine formulations in human GI tract and to correlate their GI concentration
      with drug concentration in plasma. Healthy human subjects were orally
      administered Pentasa, Apriso, or Lialda. GI fluids were aspirated from stomach,
      duodenum, proximal jejunum, mid jejunum, and distal jejunum regions. Mesalamine
      (5-ASA) and its primary metabolite acetyl-5-mesalamine (Ac-5-ASA) were measured
      using LC-MS/MS. GI tract pH was measured from each GI fluid sample, which
      averaged 1.82, 4.97, 5.67, 6.17, and 6.62 in the stomach, duodenum, proximal
      jejunum, middle jejunum, and distal jejunum, respectively. For Pentasa, high
      levels of 5-ASA in solution were observed in the stomach, duodenum, proximal
      jejunum, mid jejunum, and distal jejunum from 1 to 7 h. Apriso had minimal 5-ASA 
      levels in stomach, low to medium levels of 5-ASA in duodenum and proximal jejunum
      from 4 to 7 h, and high levels of 5-ASA in distal jejunum from 3 to 7 h. In
      contrast, Lialda had minimal 5-ASA levels from stomach and early small intestine.
      A composite appearance rate (CAR) was calculated from the deconvolution of
      individual plasma concentration to reflect drug release, dissolution, transit,
      and absorption in the GI tract. Individuals dosed with Pentasa had high levels of
      CAR from 1 to 10 h; individuals dosed with Apriso had low levels of CAR from 1 to
      4 h and high levels of CAR from 5 to 10 h; Lialda showed minimal levels of CAR
      from 0 to 5 h, then increased to medium levels from 5 to 12 h, and then decreased
      to further lower levels after 12 h. In the colon region, Pentasa and Apriso
      showed similar levels of accumulated 5-ASA excreted in the feces, while Lialda
      showed slightly higher 5-ASA accumulation in feces. However, all three
      formulations showed similar levels of metabolite Ac-5-ASA in the feces. These
      results provide direct measurement of drug dissolution in the GI tract, which can
      serve as a basis for investigation of bioequivalence for locally acting drug
      products.

TI  - Methodological Quality Assessment of Meta-Analyses and Systematic Reviews of
      Probiotics in Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Pouchitis.
PG  - e0168785
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0168785 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics are widely used for the induction and maintenance of
      remission in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and pouchitis. There are a large
      number of meta-analyses (MAs)/ systematic reviews (SRs) on this subject, the
      methodological quality of which has not been evaluated. OBJECTIVES: This study
      aimed to evaluate the methodological quality of and summarize the evidence
      obtained from MAs/SRs of probiotic treatments for IBD and pouchitis patients.
      METHODS: The PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and China National Knowledge
      Infrastructure (CNKI) databases were searched to identify Chinese and English
      language MAs/SRs of the use of probiotics for IBD and pouchitis. The Assessment
      of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) scale was used to assess the
      methodological quality of the studies. RESULTS: A total of 36 MAs/SRs were
      evaluated. The AMSTAR scores of the included studies ranged from 1 to 10, and the
      average score was 5.81. According to the Canadian Agency for Drugs and
      Technologies in Health, 4 articles were classified as high quality, 24 articles
      were classified as moderate quality, and 8 articles were classified as low
      quality. Most of the MAs/SRs suggested that probiotics had potential benefits for
      patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), but failed to show effectiveness in the
      induction and maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease (CD). The probiotic
      preparation VSL#3 may play a beneficial role in pouchitis. CONCLUSION: The
      overall methodological quality of the current MAs/SRs in the field of probiotics 
      for IBD and pouchitis was found to be low to moderate. More MAs/SRs of high
      quality are required to support using probiotics to treat IBD and pouchitis.

AB  - Among the neoplasias, colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer
      death in men and women. The increasing incidence of this type of cancer is due to
      the increase in the population's life expectancy, by the increase in chronic
      inflammatory bowel diseases, primarily ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease,
      and the change in eating habits. The American Cancer Society (2011) shows that
      diet might be responsible for approximately 30% of cancer cases in developed
      countries, moreover when considering only colorectal cancer, the number can reach
      30% to 50%. Probiotics are effective in the prevention and treatment of many
      bowel diseases as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), diarrhea, irritable bowel
      syndrome, gluten intolerance, gastroenteritis, Helicobacter pyloriinfection, and 
      colon cancer. Classical examples are strains from the Lactobacillus, and
      Bifidobacteriumgenus that have probiotic proprieties with a potential use in the 
      prophylaxis, as well as in the treatment of a variety of gastrointestinal tract
      disorders. Researchers are focusing on extremely important studies regarding the 
      possibility of using probiotics to promote a balanced microbiota composition, and
      a sufficient immunological surveillance system as a way to prevent cancer.
      Considering the fact that the human intestines host 100 trillion bacteria,
      including more than 1,000 species, there is still need to perform more in depth
      investigations in order to find probiotics with potential to prevent, and treat
      cancerous diseases, adding a very promising effect to this already successful
      panorama. This revision aims to conduct a review of the most recent studies
      correlating probiotics and its cancer preventing and treatment potential.

AB  - Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease with 
      detrimental sequela. In many patients, PSC progresses to end-stage liver disease 
      and hepatobiliary cancer. There is no medical therapy that is proven to halt or
      reverse the progression of PSC. Approximately 70 to 80% of PSC patients have
      inflammatory bowel disease, usually ulcerative colitis. The etiology of PSC is
      poorly understood. Several lines of evidence suggest that the intestinal
      microbiota plays an important role in the etiopathogenesis of PSC. Stemming from 
      this theory, several antibiotics have been tried in PSC, some of which had shown 
      promising results. Fecal microbiota transplantation is a novel therapy, and is
      currently being investigated as a potential therapeutic strategy in PSC along
      with probiotics. In this article, the authors discuss the current knowledge of
      the intestinal microbiota in PSC.

AB  - Clostridium difficile was first identified in 1978 as a diarrhea-causing
      bacterium in humans. In the last three decades, C. difficile infection (CDI) has 
      reached an epidemic state, both in health care and community settings worldwide. 
      There has been substantial progress in the field of CDI, including identification
      of novel risk factors, presence of CDI in individuals not considered at risk
      previously, and treatment options including new drugs, monoclonal antibodies, and
      fecal microbiota transplantation. This review discusses epidemiology, novel and
      traditional risk factors, and updates in management for CDI.

AB  - Phage therapy is an old method of combating bacterial pathogens that has recently
      been taken into consideration due to the alarming spread of antibiotic
      resistance. Escherichia coli O157:H7 is a foodborne pathogen that causes
      hemorrhagic colitis and life-threatening Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS). There
      are several studies on isolation of specific phages against E. coli O157:H7 and
      more than 60 specific phages have been published so far. Although in vitro
      experiments have been successful in elimination or reduction of E. coli
      O157:H7numbers, in vivo experiments have not been as promising. This may be due
      to escape of bacteria to locations where phages have difficulties to enter or due
      to the adverse conditions in the gastrointestinal tract that affect phage
      viability and proliferation. To get around the latter obstacle, an alternative
      phage delivery method such as polymer microencapsulation should be tried. While
      the present time results are not very encouraging the work should be continued as
      more efficient phage treatment regimens might be found in future.

TI  - Impact of High-Dose Vitamin D3 Supplementation in Patients with Crohn's Disease
      in Remission: A Pilot Randomized Double-Blind Controlled Study.
PG  - 448-455
LID - 10.1007/s10620-016-4396-7 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To assess the tolerability and efficacy of high-dose vitamin D3 in patients 
      with Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind
      placebo-controlled trial of high-dose vitamin D3 at 10,000 IU daily (n = 18)
      compared to 1000 IU daily (n = 16) for 12 months in patients with CD in
      remission. The primary outcome was change in serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D levels.
      Secondary outcomes included clinical relapse rates and changes in mood scores.
      RESULTS: High-dose vitamin D3 at 10,000 IU daily significantly improved
      25-hydroxy-vitamin D levels from a mean of 73.5 nmol/L [standard deviation (SD)
      11.7 nmol/L] to 160.8 nmol/L (SD 43.2 nmol/L) (p = 0.02). On an
      intention-to-treat basis, the rate of relapse was not significantly different
      between patients receiving low- and high-dose vitamin D3 (68.8 vs 33.3%, p =
      0.0844). In per-protocol analysis, clinical relapse of Crohn's disease was less
      frequently observed in patients receiving a high dose (0/12 or 0%) compared to
      those receiving a low dose of 1000 IU daily (3/8 or 37.5%) (p = 0.049).
      Improvement in anxiety and depression scores and a good safety profile were
      observed in both groups treated with vitamin D3. CONCLUSIONS: Oral
      supplementation with high-dose vitamin D3 at 10,000 IU daily significantly
      improved serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D levels. Rates of clinical relapse were
      similar between both groups. Larger studies using high-dose vitamin D3 for
      treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases are warranted. CLINICALTRIALS. GOV

TI  - The biologics of ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 175-184
LID - 10.1080/14712598.2017.1271871 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors dramatically changed the
      management of moderate-to-severe phenotypes of ulcerative colitis. The recent
      incoming of vedolizumab, which targets gut-specific leukocyte trafficking,
      provides a new biologic option for these patients. Areas covered: This review
      focuses on the rationale of use, efficacy, and safety profile of all biologics
      currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European
      Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of ulcerative colitis, including tumor
      necrosis factor alpha inhibitors (Infliximab and biosimilars, adalimumab, and
      golimumab), and the more recent vedolizumab. Expert opinion: Although biologics
      have been available in clinical practice for ulcerative colitis for about 15
      years, there are several aspects that have not been fully understood yet: we know
      that they work, but we still don't know which subsets of patients benefit more,
      and how to optimize their use. All these unresolved problems are at least partly 
      due to the discrepancy observed between phase II/III clinical trials of all
      biologics currently used in ulcerative colitis and in clinical practice.

AB  - Whereas a number of studies have examined the effects of soy isoflavones and
      tocopherols on colonic inflammation, few have examined soy protein. We determined
      the radical scavenging and cytoprotective effects of soy protein concentrate
      (SPC) in vitro and its anti-inflammatory effects in dextran sulfate sodium
      (DSS)-treated mice. Cotreatment with SPC protected Caco-2 human colon cells from 
      H2O2-induced cell death and mitigated intracellular oxidative stress. Treatment
      of differentiated Caco-2 cells with SPC blunted DSS-induced increases in
      monolayer permeability. Pepsin/pancreatin-digested SPC had reduced radical
      scavenging activity, but retained the monolayer protective effects of SPC. In
      vivo, 1.5% DSS caused body weight loss, colon shortening, and splenomegaly in
      CF-1 mice. Co-treatment with 12% SPC mitigated DSS-induced body weight loss and
      splenomegaly. DSS increased colonic interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and monocyte
      chemotactic protein-1 expression. The levels of these markers were significantly 
      lower in mice co-treated with SPC. SPC prevented DSS-mediated reductions in
      colonic glucagon-like peptide 2 levels, suggesting that SPC can prevent loss of
      gut barrier function, but no significant effect on claudin 1 and occludin mRNA
      levels of was observed. SPC-treated mice had lower colonic mRNA expression of
      toll-like receptor 4 and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing
      protein-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing protein 3 (NLRP3), and
      lower caspase-1 enzyme activity than DSS-treated mice. In summary, SPC exerted
      antioxidant and cytoprotective effects in vitro and moderated the severity of
      DSS-induced inflammation and loss of gut barrier function in vivo. These effects 
      appear to be mediated in part through reduced NLRP3 expression and caspase 1
      activity.

TI  - Prebiotics and synbiotics in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 477-485
LID - 10.1080/00365521.2016.1263680 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the
      colon with unclear pathogenesis. A dysbiotic intestinal microbiota is regarded as
      a key component in the disease process and there has been significant interest in
      developing new treatments which target the microbiota. AIM: To give an overview
      of the studies to date investigating prebiotics and synbiotics for the treatment 
      of UC. METHODS: A literature search of PubMed and related search engines was
      carried out using the terms "ulcerative colitis" in combination with "prebiotic",
      "synbiotic" or "dietary fibre". RESULTS: In total 17 studies on humans examining 
      the effect of prebiotics in UC were found. Five major groups could be
      distinguished. Fructo-oligosaccharides were tried in six studies (mean 35
      patients included, range 9-121). One study found a clinical response while two
      demonstrated indirect evidence of an effect. Germinated barley foodstuff was used
      in 8 studies (mean 38 patients, range 10-63). One study found an endoscopic
      response, while four noted a clinical response and two some indirect effects.
      Galacto-oligosaccharides, lactulose and resveratrol were used in one study each
      (mean 48 patients, range 41-52). One study found an endoscopic response and one a
      clinical response. CONCLUSION: There is yet inadequate evidence - especially in
      humans - to support any particular prebiotic in the clinical management of UC.
      However, due to the bulk of evidence supporting the effect of the microbiota on
      colonic inflammation, there is enough potential to justify further high-quality
      clinical trials investigating this subject.

AB  - Melatonin is produced in the pineal gland as well as many other organs, including
      the enterochromaffin cells of the digestive mucosa. Melatonin is a powerful
      antioxidant that resists oxidative stress due to its capacity to directly
      scavenge reactive species, to modulate the antioxidant defense system by
      increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes, and to stimulate the innate
      immune response through its direct and indirect actions. In addition, the
      dysregulation of the circadian system is observed to be related with alterations 
      in colonic motility and cell disruptions due to the modifications of clock genes 
      expression. In the gastrointestinal tract, the activities of melatonin are
      mediated by melatonin receptors (MT2), serotonin (5-HT), and cholecystokinin B
      (CCK2) receptors and via receptor-independent processes. The levels of melatonin 
      in the gastrointestinal tract exceed by 10-100 times the blood concentrations.
      Also, there is an estimated 400 times more melatonin in the gut than in the
      pineal gland. Gut melatonin secretion is suggested to be influenced by the food
      intake. Low dose melatonin treatment accelerates intestinal transit time whereas 
      high doses may decrease gut motility. Melatonin has been studied as a co-adjuvant
      treatment in several gastrointestinal diseases including irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS), constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C), diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D),
      Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and necrotizing enterocolitis. The purpose
      of this review is to provide information regarding the potential benefits of
      melatonin as a co-adjuvant treatment in gastrointestinal diseases, especially
      IBS, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and necrotizing enterocolitis.

TI  - Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's Disease Are Associated with Decreased Serum
      Selenium Concentrations and Increased Cardiovascular Risk.
LID - E780 [pii]
AB  - The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and associated oxidative stress
      is increasing. The antioxidant mineral selenium (Se) was measured in serum
      samples from 106 IBD patients (53 with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 53 with
      Crohn's disease (CD)) and from 30 healthy controls. Serum Se concentrations were 
      significantly lower in UC and CD patients than in healthy controls (p < 0.001)
      and significantly lower in CD patients than in UC patients (p = 0.006). Se
      concentrations in patients were significantly influenced by sex, body mass index 
      (BMI), the inflammatory biomarker alpha-1-antitrypsin, surgery, medical
      treatment, the severity, extent, and form of the disease and the length of time
      since onset (p < 0.05). Se concentrations in IBD patients were positively and
      linearly correlated with nutritional (protein, albumin, prealbumin,
      cholinesterase and total cholesterol) and iron status-related (hemoglobin, Fe and
      hematocrit) parameters (p < 0.05). A greater impairment of serum Se and
      cardiovascular status was observed in CD than in UC patients. An adequate
      nutritional Se status is important in IBD patients to minimize the cardiovascular
      risk associated with increased inflammation biomarkers, especially in
      undernourished CD patients, and is also related to an improved nutritional and
      body iron status.

TI  - Fermented barley and soybean (BS) mixture enhances intestinal barrier function in
      dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model.
PG  - 498
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by chronic or
      relapsing immune system activation and inflammation within the gastrointestinal
      tract. The lack of safety and efficacy of standard therapies, the use of food
      supplements for managing IBD is increasing, and many studies have reported that
      various food supplements provide many beneficial effects for the IBD. METHODS:
      This study aimed to evaluate the anti-colitis effects of dietary supplementation 
      with a fermented barley and soybean mixture (BS) on intestinal inflammation using
      a murine model of IBD. Female C57BL/6 mice were administered with either BS (100 
      and 200 mg/kg/day) or vehicle (PBS) control through oral gavages for 3 days and
      received 5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) drinking water to induce colitis. Mice
      body weight was measured every two days and disease activity index (DAI) score
      was determined on Day 15; mice were sacrificed and colons were analyzed by H & E 
      staining and RT-PCR. We also measured intestinal barrier function in vitro using 
      DSS-treated Caco-2 cells by assessing ZO-1 immunofluorescence staining and
      Western blotting and in vivo by measuring serum level of FITC-Dextran and by
      performing bacteria culture from mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) extract. The gut
      microbiota was examined by real time PCR using fecal DNA. RESULTS: We found that 
      BS alleviated the severity of colitis in a DSS-induced colitis mouse model, and
      suppressed levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in colonic tissue. Moreover, BS
      prevented epithelial barrier dysfunction, inducing an increase of tight junction 
      protein levels in colonic tissues, BS also inhibited FITC-dextran permeability,
      and suppressed bacterial translocation to MLNs. In addition, BS increased the
      levels of Lactobacilli and Bacteroides, which have anti-inflammatory properties. 
      CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that BS has protective roles against inflammatory 
      bowel disease through changes in inflammatory activity, tight junction protein
      expression, and gut microbiota composition in DSS-induced colitis.

      inflammation and tolerance.
PG  - 377-394
LID - 10.1189/jlb.1RU0716-327R [doi]
AB  - The intestinal epithelial lining is a very dynamic interface, where multiple
      interactions occur with the external world. The intestinal epithelial barrier is 
      continuously exposed to a huge load of commensal microorganisms, food-borne
      antigens, as well as invading enteropathogens. Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs)
      and underlying immune cells are the main players in maintaining the delicate
      balance between gut tolerance and inflammation. IECs deferentially express the
      variety of chemokines and chemokine receptors, and these receptor-ligand
      interactions not only mediate the infiltration and activation of immune cells but
      also switch on the survival cascades in IECs. In this review, we discussed how
      chemokine-chemokine receptor-induced interactions play a central role to
      coordinate the interplay between IECs and gut immune cells to maintain
      homeostasis or elicit gut inflammation. Furthermore, we discussed how chemokines 
      and chemokine receptors were used as a target for developing new drugs and
      therapies to control gut inflammation and autoimmunity.

AB  - Answering the question << what's new in internal medecine in 2016? >> is very
      challenging. We used 3 methods of article selection to reduce the selection bias:
      3 authors, a systematic review of the articles discussed in the weekly
      bibliographic meeting of our unit (Dermatology department, Saint-Louis Hospital, 
      Paris, France) and a selection of the best articles by several internal medecine 
      practitioners in Paris. Eleven << hot topics >> were analyzed: i/lowering

TI  - Evaluation of Serum Trace Element Levels and Superoxide Dismutase Activity in
      Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Translating Basic Research into
      Clinical Application.
PG  - 235-240
LID - 10.1007/s12011-016-0891-0 [doi]
AB  - The relationship of minerals and trace elements with inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) is complex. Alterations in their metabolism can be induced by the diseases 
      and their complications. To study the role of trace elements in IBD patients'
      serum zinc and copper and their related enzymes, including superoxide dismutase
      (SOD), activity were measured in patients with IBD patients as well as in healthy
      subjects. In addition, the correlation between serum trace element levels,
      albumin, total protein, urea level, copper/zinc ratio, and disease activity (DA) 
      was determined in these subjects. Serum samples were obtained from 35 patients
      (19 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 16 Crohn's disease (CD)) in the active phase of
      the disease and 30 healthy control subjects. Serum levels of zinc, copper, SOD
      activity, albumin, total protein, and urea were measured. The results were
      compared between the two groups using independent Student's t test in statistical
      analysis. Serum levels of zinc, SOD activity, albumin, and total protein were
      significantly lower (P < 0.05) in patients than controls, while serum urea level 
      was significantly higher in patients compared to controls. Copper concentrations 
      did not differ between patients with IBD (mean +/- SD, 58.8 +/- 20.7 mug/d) and
      controls (55.57 +/- 12.6 mug/d). Decreased levels of zinc and SOD activity are
      associated with increased inflammatory processes indicating inappropriate
      antioxidant system in patients with IBD. Additionally, lower levels of albumin
      and total protein with higher level of urea reflect metabolic problems in liver
      system.

TI  - Liver abscess and bacteremia caused by lactobacillus: role of probiotics? Case
      report and review of the literature.
PG  - 138
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactobacilli are non-spore forming, lactic acid producing,
      gram-positive rods. They are a part of the normal gastrointestinal and
      genitourinary microbiota and have rarely been reported to be the cause of
      infections. Lactobacilli species are considered non-pathogenic organisms and have
      been used as probiotics to prevent antibiotic associated diarrhea. There are
      sporadic reported cases of infections related to lactobacilli containing
      probiotics. CASE PRESENTATION: In this paper we discuss a case of an 82 year old 
      female with liver abscess and bacteremia from lactobacillus after using
      probiotics containing lactobacilli in the course of her treatment of Clostridium 
      difficile colitis. The Lactobacillus strain identification was not performed and 
      therefore, both commensal microbiota and the probiotic product should be
      considered as possible sources of the strain. CONCLUSION: Lactobacilli can lead
      to bacteremia and liver abscesses in some susceptible persons and greater
      awareness of this potential side effect is warranted with the increasing use of
      probiotics containing lactobacilli.

TI  - Isoliquiritigenin decreases the incidence of colitis-associated colorectal cancer
      by modulating the intestinal microbiota.
PG  - 85318-85331
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.13347 [doi]
AB  - Imbalances in intestinal bacteria correlate with colitis-associated colorectal
      cancer (CAC). Traditional Chinese medicines have been used to adjust the gut
      microbiota, and isoliquiritigenin (ISL), a flavonoid extracted from licorice, has
      shown antitumor efficacy. In this study, the effects of ISL on CAC development
      and the gut microbiota were evaluated using an azoxymethane and dextran sulphate 
      sodium (AOM/DSS)-induced mouse model of CAC (CACM). Histopathological analysis
      suggested that ISL reduced tumor incidence in vivo. Moreover, high-throughput
      sequencing and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) studies
      of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene revealed that the structure of the gut microbial
      community shifted significantly following AOM/DSS treatment, and that effect was 
      alleviated by treatment with high-dose ISL (150 mg/kg). Compared to the
      microbiota in the control mice (CK), the levels of Bacteroidetes decreased and
      the levels of Firmicutes increased during CAC development. ISL reversed the
      imbalance at the phylum level and altered the familial constituents of the gut
      microbiota. Specifically, the abundance of Helicobacteraceae increased after
      treatment with high-dose ISL, while the abundance of Lachnospiraceae and
      Rikenellaceae decreased. At the genus level, ISL reduced the abundance of
      opportunistic pathogens (Escherichia and Enterococcus), and increased the levels 
      of probiotics, particularly butyrate-producing bacteria (Butyricicoccus,
      Clostridium, and Ruminococcus). Thus, ISL protects mice from AOM/DSS-induced CAC,
      and ISL and the gut microbiota may have synergistic anti-cancer effects.

AB  - Despite the accepted health benefits of consuming dietary fiber, little is known 
      about the mechanisms by which fiber deprivation impacts the gut microbiota and
      alters disease risk. Using a gnotobiotic mouse model, in which animals were
      colonized with a synthetic human gut microbiota composed of fully sequenced
      commensal bacteria, we elucidated the functional interactions between dietary
      fiber, the gut microbiota, and the colonic mucus barrier, which serves as a
      primary defense against enteric pathogens. We show that during chronic or
      intermittent dietary fiber deficiency, the gut microbiota resorts to
      host-secreted mucus glycoproteins as a nutrient source, leading to erosion of the
      colonic mucus barrier. Dietary fiber deprivation, together with a fiber-deprived,
      mucus-eroding microbiota, promotes greater epithelial access and lethal colitis
      by the mucosal pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium. Our work reveals intricate
      pathways linking diet, the gut microbiome, and intestinal barrier dysfunction,
      which could be exploited to improve health using dietary therapeutics.

AB  - With the recent approval of several new targeted therapies for chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), there are now multiple options for its treatment.
      Inhibitors of Bruton tyrosine kinase (with ibrutinib being the first-in-class US 
      Food and Drug Administration-approved agent) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (with 
      idelalisib as the first-in-class approved agent) are promising because they are
      generally well tolerated and highly effective against this malignancy. These
      agents may be particularly important in the treatment of older patients who are
      less able to tolerate the myelosuppression (and subsequent infections) associated
      with chemoimmunotherapy. As a class of medications, B-cell receptor inhibitors
      have some unique side effects, including redistribution lymphocytosis. Toxicities
      associated specifically with ibrutinib include increased risk for bleeding and
      atrial fibrillation. Idelalisib also has some unique toxicities: transaminitis,
      colitis, and pneumonitis. Targeted therapies recently approved for use in CLL
      include the novel anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies obinutuzumab and ofatumumab,
      and the B-cell lymphoma 2 inhibitor venetoclax. This article describes the
      clinical data that led to approval of these B-cell receptor inhibitors for the
      treatment of CLL, and highlights newer agents in clinical development that target
      the same kinases as the currently available therapies.

TI  - Molecular and Phylogenetic Characterization of Non-O157 Shiga Toxin-Producing
      Escherichia coli Strains in China.
PG  - 143
AB  - Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) causes diarrhea and hemorrhagic
      colitis with life-threatening complications, such as hemolytic uremic syndrome.
      The aim of this study was to assess the molecular epidemiologic features of
      non-O157 STEC strains from different resources in China and illustrate the role
      of animal reservoirs or animal-derived foodstuffs in human STEC infections. A
      collection of 301 non-O157 STEC isolates from domestic and wild animals (i.e.,
      cattle, goat, pig, yak, pika, and antelope), raw meats (i.e., beef, pork, mutton,
      chicken, and duck), diarrheal patients, and healthy carriers in different regions
      of China were selected in this study. Of the 301 analyzed STEC isolates, 67
      serogroups, and 118 serotypes were identified; this included some predominant
      serogroups associated with human disease, such as O26, O45, O103, O111, and O121.
      Eighteen different combinations of stx subtypes were found. Eleven isolates
      carried the intimin gene eae, 93 isolates contained ehxA, and 73 isolates carried
      astA. The prevalence of other putative adhesion genes saa, paa, efa1, and toxB
      was 28.90% (87), 6.98% (21), 2.31% (7), and 1% (3), respectively. The
      phylogenetic distribution of isolates was analyzed by multilocus sequence typing 
      (MLST). Ninety-four sequence types were assigned across the 301 isolates. A
      subset of isolates recovered from yak and pika residing in the similar wild
      environments, Qinghai-Tibetan plateau, showed similar genetic profiles and more
      tendencies to cluster together. Isolates from goat and mutton exhibited close
      genetic relatedness with those from human-derived isolates, providing evidence
      that transmission may have occurred locally within intraspecies or interspecies, 
      and importantly, from animal reservoirs, or raw meats to humans. Comparing
      isolates in this study with highly virulent strains by MLST, along with
      serotyping and virulence profiles, it is conceivable that some of isolates from
      goat, yak, or raw meats may have potential to cause human diseases.

TI  - Bamboo Salt Suppresses Colon Carcinogenesis in C57BL/6 Mice with Chemically
      Induced Colitis.
PG  - 1015-1022
AB  - The aim of our experiment was to evaluate the anticancer effect of bamboo salt
      (BS) on C57BL/6 mice in an azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate
      (DSS)-induced colon cancer model. BS, solar salt, and purified salt were
      evaluated for their protective effects during AOM/DSS-induced colon
      carcinogenesis in C57BL/6 mice. BS, especially after baking for nine separate
      intervals (BS9x), suppressed colon carcinogenesis in the mice. BS9x decreased
      colon length shortening, weight-to-length ratios, and tumor counts. Pathological 
      evidence from histological evaluation by hematoxylin and eosin staining also
      revealed suppression of tumorigenesis. BS9x lowered serum levels of
      proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta) to close to those of
      the Normal group. Additionally, BS9x suppressed colon mRNA expression of
      proinflammatory factors and significantly regulated mRNA levels of the
      apoptosis-related factors, Bax and Bcl-2, and the cell cycle-related genes, p21
      and p53. Additionally, immunohistochemistry showed that BS promoted p21
      expression in the colon. Taken together, the results indicate that BS exhibited
      anticancer efficacy by modulating apoptosis- and inflammation-related gene
      expression during colon carcinogenesis in mice, and repetition in baking cycles
      of BS enhanced its anticancer functionality.

TI  - Anti-inflammaging effects of Lactobacillus brevis OW38 in aged mice.
PG  - 707-718
AB  - In the present study, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains were collected from
      kimchi and were screened to isolate strains that inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
      production by Escherichia coli and p16 expression and nuclear factor-kappa B
      (NF-kappaB) activation in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Oral administration of
      Lactobacillus brevis OW38 (1x10(9) cfu/mouse) to aged mice (male, 18 months old) 
      for 8 weeks reduced the LPS level in colon fluid and blood. In addition, OW38
      treatment also reduced the ratio of Firmicutes or Proteobacteria to
      Bacteroidetes, which was significantly higher in aged mice than in young mice.
      Treatment with OW38 in aged mice inhibited the expression of inflammatory
      markers, such as myeloperoxidase, tumour necrosis factor (TNF), and interleukin
      (IL)-1beta, and inhibited NF-kappaB activation. Furthermore, it induced the
      expression of colonic tight junction proteins zonula occludens-1, occludin, and
      claudin-1. OW38 treatment also suppressed the expression of senescence markers
      p16, p53, and SAMHD1 in the colon and the hippocampus of aged mice. In addition, 
      it significantly restored spontaneous alternation as well as the expression of
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor and doublecortin in aged mice compared to that 
      in young mice (P<0.05). Based on these findings, we conclude that OW38 treatment 
      may ameliorate aging-associated colitis and memory impairment by inhibiting gut
      microbiota LPS production, NF-kappaB activation, and p16 expression.

AB  - Non-IgE-mediated gastrointestinal food allergic disorders (non-IgE-GI-FA)
      including food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES), food
      protein-induced enteropathy (FPE), and food protein-induced allergic
      proctocolitis (FPIAP) are relatively uncommon in infants and young children, but 
      are likely under-diagnosed. Non-IgE-GI-FA have a favorable prognosis, with
      majority resolving by age 3-5 years. Diagnosis relies on the recognition of
      symptoms pattern in FPIAP and FPIES and biopsy in FPE. Further studies are needed
      for a better understanding of the pathomechanism, which will lead eventually to
      the development of diagnostic tests and treatments. Limited evidence supports the
      role of food allergens in subsets of constipation, gastroesophageal reflux
      disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and colic. The immunologic pathomechanism is
      not fully understood and empiric prolonged avoidance of food allergens should be 
      limited to minimize nutrient deficiency and feeding disorders/food aversions in
      infants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prebiotic dietary fibers resist digestion in the upper
      gastrointestinal tract and allow for stimulation of bacteria in the distal
      intestine and colon. Stimulation of bacteria among different individuals varies
      greatly, depending on a wide range of variables. OBJECTIVE: To determine the
      range of differences in response between individuals, a preclinical in vitro
      fermentation was conducted with six fecal donors. The primary objective was to
      compare the fecal microbiota of six individuals at baseline, 12 h and 24 h
      post-exposure to partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG). METHOD: Fecal donations
      were collected from six healthy individuals consuming a non-specific Western
      diet, free of antibiotic treatments in the past year, not affected by any GI
      diseases and not consuming any probiotic or prebiotic supplements. Fecal samples 
      were exposed to 0.5 g of PHGG and measured for bacterial changes at 0, 12 and 24 
      h based on 16S rRNA sequencing. RESULTS: Parabacteroides increased from 3.48% of 
      sequence reads to 10.62% of sequence reads after 24 h (p = 0.0181) and
      Bacteroidetes increased from 45.89% of sequence reads to 50.29% of sequence reads
      (p = 0.0008). CONCLUSIONS: PHGG stimulates growth of Parabacteroides, a genus of 
      bacteria that have been inversely associated with IBS and ulcerative colitis.
      PHGG provides stimulation of beneficial Bacteroidetes (Bacteroides and
      Parabacteroides), which may be correlated with many positive health markers and
      outcomes. PHGG is a prebiotic dietary fiber that is readily fermentable.

TI  - Regulation of the human gut homeostasis by anti-inflammatory CD14(+) CD163(high) 
      CD160(high) myeloid cells.
PG  - 441-447
AB  - The gut is a unique tissue where a refined balance is maintained between immune
      responses and tolerance to a variety of foreign antigens including food and
      commensal bacteria. Although activation of T helper (Th) cells, such as Th1 and
      Th17 cells, is responsible for the host defense against invading pathogens in the
      gut, inappropriate Th1/Th17 responses cause onset and/or progression of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) comprised of two major disorders; ulcerative
      colitis and Crohn's disease. Therefore, the inflammatory responses by Th1/Th17
      cells in the gut are tightly regulated through a number of mechanisms. In the
      human intestine, several innate immune cell subsets play important roles in the
      maintenance of the gut homeostasis by controlling adaptive immune responses. We
      recently identified CD14(+) CD163(low) cells and CD14(+) CD163(high) CD160(high) 
      cells as Th17-inducing dendritic cells and anti-inflammatory phagocytes,
      respectively. In addition, the dysfunction of these cell subsets was observed in 
      the patients with IBD. Therefore, it would be an important future issue to
      analyze the mechanisms underlying regulation of intestinal innate immune cell
      homeostasis for the development of a novel therapeutic intervention for IBD.

AB  - The most common question asked by patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) 
      is, "Doctor, what should I eat?" Findings from epidemiology studies have
      indicated that diets high in animal fat and low in fruits and vegetables are the 
      most common pattern associated with an increased risk of IBD. Low levels of
      vitamin D also appear to be a risk factor for IBD. In murine models, diets high
      in fat, especially saturated animal fats, also increase inflammation, whereas
      supplementation with omega 3 long-chain fatty acids protect against intestinal
      inflammation. Unfortunately, omega 3 supplements have not been shown to decrease 
      the risk of relapse in patients with Crohn's disease. Dietary intervention
      studies have shown that enteral therapy, with defined formula diets, helps
      children with Crohn's disease and reduces inflammation and dysbiosis. Although
      fiber supplements have not been shown definitively to benefit patients with IBD, 
      soluble fiber is the best way to generate short-chain fatty acids such as
      butyrate, which has anti-inflammatory effects. Addition of vitamin D and curcumin
      has been shown to increase the efficacy of IBD therapy. There is compelling
      evidence from animal models that emulsifiers in processed foods increase risk for
      IBD. We discuss current knowledge about popular diets, including the specific
      carbohydrate diet and diet low in fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides
      and polyols. We present findings from clinical and basic science studies to help 
      gastroenterologists navigate diet as it relates to the management of IBD.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Both science and patients associate diet with inflammatory
      bowel disease [IBD]. There is no doubt that links between IBD and diet are
      numerous, based on both epidemiological studies and experimental studies.
      However, scientific evidence to support dietary advice is currently lacking, and 
      dietary counselling for IBD patients is often limited in clinical practice to the
      improvement of nutrient intake. This review aimed to focus on both patient's
      beliefs about and molecular mechanisms for crosstalk between nutrients and
      inflammation. METHODS: A literature search using PubMed was performed to identify
      relevant studies on diet and/or nutrients and their role in IBD. Pubmed [from
      inception to January 20, 2016] was searched using the terms: 'Crohn', 'colitis','
      intestinal epithelial cells', and a list of terms relating to diet or numerous
      specific nutrients. Terms associated with nutrients were individually tested in
      the context of IBD. Reference lists from studies selected were manually searched 
      to identify further relevant reports. Manuscripts about diet in the context of
      IBD from basic science, epidemiological studies, or clinical trials were selected
      and reviewed. Only articles published in English were included. RESULTS:
      Epidemiological studies highlight the key role of diet in IBD development, and
      many IBD patients report diet as a triggering factor in relapse of disease. In
      addition, we present research on the impact of nutrients on innate immunity.
      CONCLUSION: Diet may offer an alternative approach to restoring deficient innate 
      immunity in IBD, and this may be the scientific rationale for providing dietary
      counselling for IBD patients.

      bowel disorders.
PG  - 1426-1449
LID - 10.1111/bph.13632 [doi]
AB  - Functional bowel disorders (FBD), mainly irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and
      functional constipation (FC, also called chronic idiopathic constipation), are
      very common worldwide. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative
      colitis and Crohn's disease, although less common, has a strong impact on
      patients' quality of life, as well as being highly expensive for our healthcare. 
      A definite cure for those disorders is still yet to come. Over the years, several
      therapeutic approaches complementary or alternative to traditional
      pharmacological treatments, including probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, fibre
      and herbal medicinal products, have been investigated for the management of both 
      groups of diseases. However, most available studies are biased by several
      drawbacks, including small samples and poor methodological quality. Probiotics,
      in particular Saccharomyces boulardii and Lactobacilli (among which Lactobacillus
      rhamnosus), synbiotics, psyllium, and some herbal medicinal products, primarily
      peppermint oil, seem to be effective in ameliorating IBS symptoms. Synbiotics and
      fibre seem to be beneficial in FC patients. The probiotic combination VSL#3 may
      be effective in inducing remission in patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative
      colitis, in whom Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 seems to be as effective as
      mesalamine in maintaining remission. No definite conclusions can be drawn as to
      the efficacy of fibre and herbal medicinal products in IBD patients due to the
      low number of studies and the lack of randomized controlled trials that replicate
      the results obtained in the individual studies conducted so far. Thus, further,
      well-designed studies are needed to address the real role of these therapeutic
      options in the management of both FBD and IBD. LINKED ARTICLES: This article is

TI  - Reflections About Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Vitamins A and D.
PG  - 1105-1110
AB  - Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are two major forms of the inflammatory
      bowel diseases (IBDs). Vitamin A (VA) and vitamin D (VD) may be associated with
      reduction in inflammation in these disorders. The aim of this review was to show 
      the current evidence that may associate VA and VD with IBDs. Data linking VA, VD,
      and IBDs were studied. Both VA and VD may be related to the immune system in
      different manners. The active form of VA, retinoic acid, may be related to the
      growth factor-beta and release of interleukin-10 (IL-10), thus involved with the 
      resolution of the inflammation. Its deficiency is associated with the increase of
      disease activity. The active form of VD is 1,25(OH)2D3 that produces biological
      effects via the nuclear hormone receptor named VD receptor (VDR), which may
      interfere with the immune cells and macrophages leading to the suppression of the
      inflammatory process by decreasing the release of TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-6, and
      IL-8, IL-12, and IL-23. VDR may also activate nucleotide-binding oligomerization 
      domain 2 expression and stimulate the production of the defensin and cathelicidin
      that are important to the homeostasis of the mucosal immune barrier. The use of
      VA and VD could be helpful in the treatment and prevention of IBDs but more
      studies are necessary to establish the precise role of these compounds in the
      prevention or remission of these inflammatory processes.

TI  - Carbohydrate and protein intake and risk of ulcerative colitis: Systematic review
      and dose-response meta-analysis of epidemiological studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIM: Dietary carbohydrate and protein intake is generally thought as
      risk factors for onset of ulcerative colitis (UC), while epidemiological data had
      been controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the role of carbohydrate and
      protein intake in the development of UC. METHODS: Comprehensive search in PubMed 
      and Embase was conducted to identify all relevant studies, and the role of
      carbohydrate and protein intake in the development of UC was quantitatively
      assessed by dose-response meta-analysis. RESULTS: Nine studies (5 case-control
      and 4 prospective cohort) were identified with a total of 975 UC cases and 239352
      controls. The summary relative risks (RR) for per 10 g increment/day were 1.005
      (95%CI: 0.991-1.019, I(2) = 31.5%, n = 5) for total carbohydrate intake, 1.001
      (95%CI: 0.971-1.032, I(2) = 0.0%, n = 7) for the subtype of fiber intake, 1.029
      (95%CI: 0.962-1.101, I(2) = 68.9%, n = 2) for the subtype of sugar intake, and
      1.010 (95%CI: 0.975-1.047, I(2) = 12.4%, n = 7) for total protein intake. Among
      sugar subtypes, only sucrose intake was found positively related with UC risk (RR
      for per 10 g increment/day: 1.098, 95%CI: 1.024-1.177, I(2) = 0.0%, n = 3). No
      evidence of a non-linear dose-response association was found between the nutrient
      intake and UC risk, except for the subtype of sucrose (P for non-linear trend =
      0.032). Subgroup analyses showed consistent results. CONCLUSIONS: This
      meta-analysis suggested a lack of association between dietary carbohydrate or
      protein intake and the risk of UC, except for the subtype of sucrose which played
      a significant role in the development of UC. Large-scale prospective designed
      studies are needed to confirm our findings.

AB  - Complementary or alternative medicine is of great interest for the treatment of
      inflammatory bowel disease, with the aim of ameliorating the side effects of the 
      drugs commonly used or improving their efficacy. In this study, we evaluated the 
      ability of goat whey to prevent intestinal inflammation in the experimental model
      of acetic acid-induced rats and compared it to sulfasalazine. Pretreatment with
      goat whey (1, 2, and 4g/kg) and sulfasalazine (250mg/kg) on colitic rats improved
      colonic inflammatory markers, including myeloperoxidase activity, leukotriene B4 
      levels, as well as the production of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and tumor
      necrosis factor-alpha. Furthermore, the administration of goat whey significantly
      reduced the colonic oxidative stress by reducing malondialdehyde levels and
      increased total glutathione content, a potent antioxidant peptide. The
      histological evaluation of the colonic specimens from colitic rats confirmed
      these beneficial effects, as goat whey preserved the colonic tissue, especially
      in those rats treated with the highest dose of goat whey or with sulfasalazine.
      The immunohistochemistry analysis of the colonic tissue evaluation also revealed 
      a reduction in the expression of cyclooxygenase-2, inducible nitric oxide
      synthase, and matrix metalloproteinase-9, together with an increased expression
      of suppressor of cytokine signaling-1. These results suggest that goat whey
      exerted a preventive effect against the intestinal damage induced by acetic acid,
      showing a similar efficacy to that shown by sulfasalazine, therefore making it a 
      potential treatment for human inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Development and Application of a Plant-Based Diet Scoring System for Japanese
      Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
PG  - 16-019
LID - 10.7812/TPP/16-019 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Plant-based diets (PBDs) are a healthy alternative to westernized diets.
      A semivegetarian diet, a PBD, has been shown to prevent a relapse in Crohn
      disease. However, there is no way to measure adherence to PBDs. OBJECTIVE: To
      develop a simple way of evaluating adherence to a PBD for Japanese patients with 
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). DESIGN: PBD scores were assigned according to
      the frequency of consumption provided on a food-frequency questionnaire, obtained
      on hospitalization for 159 patients with ulcerative colitis and 70 patients with 
      Crohn disease. Eight items considered to be preventive factors for IBD were
      scored positively, and 8 items considered to be IBD risk factors were scored
      negatively. The PBD score was calculated from the sum of plus and minus scores.
      Higher PBD scores indicated greater adherence to a PBD. The PBD scores were
      evaluated on hospitalization and 2 years after discharge for 22 patients with
      Crohn disease whose dietary pattern and prognosis were established. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURE: Plant-Based Diet score. RESULTS: The PBD scores differed significantly, 
      in descending order, by dietary type: pro-Japanese diet, mixed type, and
      pro-westernized diet (Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis test). The PBD scores in the
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease groups were 10.9 +/- 9.5 and 8.2 +/- 8.2,
      respectively. For patients with Crohn disease, those with long-term remission and
      normal C-reactive protein concentration were significantly more likely to have
      PBD scores of 25 or greater than below 25 (chi(2)). CONCLUSION: The PBD score is 
      a valid assessment of PBD dietary adherence.

TI  - Role of prebiotics and probiotics in pediatric diseases.
PG  - 487-497
AB  - The increasing knowledge about the composition and activities of the microflora
      has shown the close link between the bacteria and the health of the human
      organism. For this reason it has focused attention on the possibility of
      modulating the gut flora. The use of probiotics and prebiotics has increased
      enormously in recent years, more for real beneficial effects demonstrated in
      patients than for their safety profiles. However, it is recorded an
      indiscriminate use also in conditions in which there are no scientific evidence
      to support. Their use in case of immunocompromised patients or with severe and
      debilitating chronic diseases should be very prudent, because of the risk of
      complications including sepsis. The use of a probiotic cannot ignore the
      knowledge of the genus and species of the strain and in pediatric patients has
      been demonstrated their role for treating acute viral gastroenteritis and
      preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea in healthy children. Moreover
      probiotics are considered as an option for recurrent and relapsing antibiotic
      sensitive pouchitis and in select patients with mild ulcerative colitis. Further 
      studies are needed to evaluate clinical conditions that may require their use and
      to define the optimal doses and intake durations.

TI  - Factors Predicting Testing and Treatment of Iron Deficiency in a Nationwide
      Cohort of Anemic UC Patients.
PG  - 2894-2901
AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is an often unrecognized and
      undertreated complication of ulcerative colitis (UC). We conducted the first
      nationwide study in the United States to evaluate the prevalence of testing for
      iron deficiency (ID) in anemic UC patients and determine the frequency of
      treatment with iron supplementation in patients with IDA. METHODS: Nationwide
      cohort of patients with newly diagnosed UC in the Veterans Affairs health care
      system was identified. Primary outcome was to evaluate if anemic UC patients were
      tested for ID and subsequently treated with iron replacement therapy if IDA is
      confirmed. Candidate parameters included factors that can impact testing and
      treatment of anemia including patients' demographics, severity of anemia, and
      endoscopic findings. RESULTS: Of 836 newly diagnosed patients with UC, 585
      patients (70%) developed anemia over the course of median 8 years of follow-up.
      Of 585 patients, 401 patients (68.6%) had iron study evaluation. Two hundred
      fifty-one patients (62.6%) were diagnosed with IDA, and among them, 191 patients 
      (76.1%) were treated with oral iron therapy. None of the patient received
      intravenous iron therapy. In multivariate analysis, patients with mild/moderate
      anemia and patients from Midwest and South region were independent predictors of 
      iron study evaluation in patients with anemia. CONCLUSIONS: More than a third of 
      anemic UC patients were not tested for ID. Once tested, almost a quarter of the
      patients with IDA were not treated with iron replacement therapy. Testing for ID 
      and subsequent treatment with iron replacement therapy should be considered among
      the quality process indicators in UC.

TI  - Patients Perceive Clinical Benefit with the Specific Carbohydrate Diet for
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
PG  - 3255-3260
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that dietary therapy may be effective for
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but limited published data exist 
      on the usage and efficacy of dietary therapy. AIM: To evaluate the perspective of
      IBD patients using the specific carbohydrate diet (SCD). METHODS: An anonymous
      online survey was conducted using REDCap, a Web-based survey tool. Survey links
      were sent to known Web sites as well as support groups in an attempt to
      characterize patient utilization of the SCD and perception of efficacy of the
      SCD. RESULTS: There were 417 respondents of the online survey on the SCD with
      IBD. Mean age for individuals on the SCD was 34.9 +/- 16.4 years. Seventy percent
      were female. Forty-seven percent had Crohn's disease, 43 % had ulcerative
      colitis, and 10 % had indeterminate colitis. Individuals perceived clinical
      improvement on the SCD. Four percent reported clinical remission prior to the
      SCD, while 33 % reported remission at 2 months after initiation of the SCD, and
      42 % at both 6 and 12 months. For those reporting clinical remission, 13 %
      reported time to achieve remission of less than 2 weeks, 17 % reported 2 weeks to
      a month, 36 % reported 1-3 months, and 34 % reported greater than 3 months. For
      individuals who reported reaching remission, 47 % of individuals reported
      associated improvement in abnormal laboratory values. CONCLUSIONS: The SCD is
      utilized by many patients as a primary and adjunct therapy for IBD. Most patients
      perceive clinical benefit to use of the SCD.

TI  - Gastrointestinal Symptoms Predictors of Health-Related Quality of Life in
      Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
PG  - e186-e192
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate the multidimensional
      gastrointestinal symptoms predictors of generic health-related quality of life
      (HRQOL) in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease from the
      perspectives of pediatric patients and parents. METHODS: The Pediatric Quality of
      Life Inventory Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales and Pediatric Quality of Life
      Inventory 4.0 Generic Core Scales were completed in a 9-site study by 260
      families of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Gastrointestinal Symptoms
      Scales measuring stomach pain, food and drink limits, gas and bloating,
      constipation, blood in stool, and diarrhea were identified as clinically
      important symptom differentiators from healthy controls based on prior findings, 
      and subsequently tested for bivariate and multivariate linear associations with
      overall HRQOL (Generic Core Scales). RESULTS: Stomach pain, food and drink
      limits, gas and bloating, constipation, blood in stool, and diarrhea were
      significantly associated with decreased HRQOL in bivariate analyses (P < 0.001). 
      In predictive models utilizing hierarchical multiple regression analyses
      controlling for age, sex, and race/ethnicity, gastrointestinal symptoms accounted
      for an additional 40% of the variance in patient self-reported HRQOL (P < 0.001) 
      and 37% of the variance in parent proxy-reported HRQOL (P < 0.001), reflecting
      large effect sizes. Stomach pain, food and drink limits, and constipation were
      significant individual patient-reported predictors after controlling for the
      other gastrointestinal symptoms in the predictive models. CONCLUSIONS:
      Patient-reported gastrointestinal symptoms differentially predicted HRQOL.
      Identifying the specific gastrointestinal symptoms from a standardized
      multidimensional gastrointestinal symptoms profile that are the most important
      predictors from the patient perspective facilitates a patient-centered approach
      for interventions designed to ameliorate impaired HRQOL.

TI  - Therapeutic modulation of gut microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease: More
      questions to be answered.
PG  - 800-810
LID - 10.1111/1751-2980.12422 [doi]
AB  - Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) exhibit impaired control of the
      microbiome in the gut, and 'dysbiosis' is commonly observed. Western diet is a
      risk factor for the development of IBD, but it may have different effects on gut 
      microbiota between IBD and non-IBD individuals. Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN)
      can induce remission in pediatric Crohn's disease with a decrease in gut
      microbial diversity. Although there are some theoretical benefits, actual
      treatment effects of prebiotics and probiotics in IBD vary. High-quality studies 
      have shown that VSL#3 (a high-potency probiotic medical food containing eight
      different strains) exhibits benefits in treating ulcerative colitis, and gut
      microbial diversity is reduced after treated with VSL#3 in animal models. The
      effect of fecal microbiome transplantation on IBD is controversial. Increasing
      microbial diversity compared with impaired handling of bacteria presents a
      dilemma. Antibiotics are the strongest factors in the reduction of microbiome
      ecological diversity. Some antibiotics may help to induce remission of the
      disease. Microbiome alteration has been suggested to be an intrinsic property of 
      IBD and a potential predictor in diagnosis and prognosis. However, the effects of
      therapeutic modulations are variable; thus, more questions remain to be answered.

TI  - Probiotics and Liver Disease: Where Are We Now and Where Are We Going?
PG  - S188-S190
AB  - Probiotics are live, nonpathogenic bacteria capable of colonizing the colonic
      mucosa. The most common probiotics include strains of Lactobacillus or
      Bifidobacteria, which are part of the normal gastrointestinal microbiota. Initial
      studies of selected probiotic species have suggested potential efficacy in
      several gastrointestinal diseases including inflammatory bowel diseases
      (particularly pouchitis), antibiotic-related diarrhea, Clostridium difficile
      toxin-induced colitis, infectious diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, and
      allergy. The so-called "gut-liver axis" involves complex interaction between the 
      liver parenchyma and gut microbiota. There is growing evidence to suggest that
      alteration in gut microbial components may affect the liver and can be a
      precipitating cofactor in development and modulating of chronic liver damage
      through ethanol, production of ammonia and endotoxin. This may allow for a better
      understanding of its role in the pathogenesis of verities of liver diseases and
      help to identify a microbial target for prevention and treatment of such
      diseases. This paper discusses the growing evidence that highlights the
      relationship between gut microbiota and development, prevention and treatment of 
      numbers of liver diseases.

TI  - Rapid change of fecal microbiome and disappearance of Clostridium difficile in a 
      colonized infant after transition from breast milk to cow milk.
PG  - 53
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile is the most common known cause of
      antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Upon the disturbance of gut microbiota by
      antibiotics, C. difficile establishes growth and releases toxins A and B, which
      cause tissue damage in the host. The symptoms of C. difficile infection disease
      range from mild diarrhea to pseudomembranous colitis and toxic megacolon.
      Interestingly, 10-50 % of infants are asymptomatic carriers of C. difficile. This
      longitudinal study of the C. difficile colonization in an infant revealed the
      dynamics of C. difficile presence in gut microbiota. METHODS: Fifty fecal
      samples, collected weekly between 5.5 and 17 months of age from a female infant
      who was an asymptomatic carrier of C. difficile, were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene
      sequencing. RESULTS: Colonization switching between toxigenic and non-toxigenic
      C. difficile strains as well as more than 100,000-fold fluctuations of C.
      difficile counts were observed. C. difficile toxins were detected during the
      testing period in some infant stool samples, but the infant never had diarrhea.
      Although fecal microbiota was stable during breast feeding, a dramatic and
      permanent change of microbiota composition was observed within 5 days of the
      transition from human milk to cow milk. A rapid decline and eventual
      disappearance of C. difficile coincided with weaning at 12.5 months. An increase 
      in the relative abundance of Bacteroides spp., Blautia spp., Parabacteroides
      spp., Coprococcus spp., Ruminococcus spp., and Oscillospira spp. and a decrease
      of Bifidobacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp., Escherichia spp., and Clostridium
      spp. were observed during weaning. The change in microbiome composition was
      accompanied by a gradual increase of fecal pH from 5.5 to 7. CONCLUSIONS: The
      bacterial groups that are less abundant in early infancy, and that increase in
      relative abundance after weaning, likely are responsible for the expulsion of C. 
      difficile.

TI  - Midkine is up-regulated in both cancerous and inflamed bowel, reflecting lymph
      node metastasis in colorectal cancer and clinical activity of ulcerative colitis.

AB  - Midkine is a multifunctional cytokine and growth factor displaying
      proinflammatory and pro-tumorigenic activity. Its association with bowel diseases
      has not been fully elucidated. Our purpose was to delineate midkine expression
      pattern by RT-qPCR in inflamed/cancerous bowel (n=208) and whole blood (n=150) in
      colorectal cancer (CRC), Crohn's disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC) and to
      evaluate midkine dynamics in early postoperative period following colorectal
      surgery. The expression of midkine was significantly up-regulated in stage III
      CRC and independently associated with lymph node metastasis. The expression of
      midkine in whole blood was up-regulated solely in N1 CRC. Midkine expression in
      cancer-free tissue (CRC) was also elevated and dependent on CRC advancement. In
      IBD, inflammation increased the bowel expression of midkine solely in UC, in a
      manner proportional to the disease clinical activity. Large and small bowel
      differed with respect to the expression of midkine in quiescent tissue (higher in
      small bowel) and to its correlation pattern with chemokines (in a large bowel)
      and angiogenic factors and cell cycle regulators (in a small bowel). Circulating 
      midkine and its expression in whole blood dropped directly following colorectal
      surgery; however, the concentration of midkine in serum was restored on
      postoperative day three. Midkine is involved in bowel inflammation in UC and
      lymph node metastasis in CRC, rendering midkine an attractive target for their
      treatment. Owing to midkine elevation in early postoperative period and its
      overexpression in tumor-adjacent tissue, targeting midkine might be considered
      also as a prevention of CRC recurrence following curative tumor resection.

TI  - The different effects of probiotics treatment on Salmonella-induced interleukin-8
      response in intestinal epithelia cells via PI3K/Akt and NOD2 expression.
PG  - 739-748
AB  - Salmonella spp. remains a major public health problem for the whole world.
      Intestinal epithelial cells serve as an essential component of the innate mucosal
      immune system to defend against Salmonella infection. A substantial amount of
      evidence has accumulated that probiotics can regulate interleukin 8 (IL-8)
      involved in innate immunity. However, the exact effect of probiotics on
      epithelial IL-8 response to Salmonella infection is not well understood.
      Therefore, we investigated the action of probiotics on Salmonella-infected Caco-2
      cells and its novel mechanisms. Two probiotic strains were examined for
      Salmonella-induced IL-8 responses and regulating proteins using Caco-2 cell
      cultures. We demonstrated probiotic, either Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG or
      Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis DSM10140, administered before Salmonella
      infection conferred significantly suppressive effect on Salmonella-induced IL-8
      responses in Caco-2 cells, either in secreted protein or mRNA, via the PI3K/Akt
      signal pathway while probiotic administered after infection enhanced
      Salmonella-induced IL-8 responses via nucleotide-binding oligomerisation
      domain-containing protein 2 expression in membrane. These findings suggest that
      the different regulation of probiotics on Salmonella-induced IL-8 responses in
      Caco-2 cells according to the administered timing supports a rationale for the
      therapeutic use of probiotics in the treatment of Salmonella colitis and
      inflammatory bowel disease. This can explain the reported controversial effect of
      probiotics on these diseases.

TI  - Preventive health measures in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 7625-44
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i34.7625 [doi]
AB  - We aim to review the literature and provide guidance on preventive health
      measures in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Structured searches were performed 
      in PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Library from January 1976
      to June 2016 using the following keywords: (inflammatory bowel disease OR Crohn's
      disease OR ulcerative colitis) AND (health maintenance OR preventive health OR
      health promotion). Abstracts of the articles selected from each of these multiple
      searches were reviewed, and those meeting the inclusion criteria (that is,
      providing data regarding preventive health or health maintenance in IBD patients)
      were recorded. Reference lists from the selected articles were manually reviewed 
      to identify further relevant studies. Patients with IBD are at increased risk of 
      developing adverse events related to the disease course, therapeutic
      interventions, or non-adherence to medication. Recent studies have suggested that
      IBD patients do not receive preventive services with the same thoroughness as
      patients with other chronic diseases. Preventive health measures can avert
      morbidity and improve the quality of life of patients with IBD.
      Gastroenterologists and primary care physicians (PCPs) should have an up to date 
      working knowledge of preventive health measures for IBD patients. A holistic
      approach and better communication between gastroenterologists and PCPs with
      explicit clarification of roles will prevent duplication of services and
      streamline care.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Oxidative stress is involved in both pathogenesis and
      exacerbation of ulcerative colitis (UC). This study was designed to evaluate
      whether resveratrol, an excellent anti-oxidant agent, can help in treatment of UC
      and its related oxidative stress. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty six patients with
      active mild to moderate disease were randomized to receive either 500 mg/day
      resveratrol capsules or the same amount of placebo for 6 weeks. Before and after 
      the intervention, disease activity, quality of life, and oxidative stress were
      assessed using the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index Questionnaire (SCCAIQ),
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire-9 (IBDQ-9), and serum level of
      malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and total anti-oxidant
      capacity (TAC), respectively. Serum SOD (122.28 +/- 11.55 to 125.77 +/- 10.97)
      and TAC (9.87 +/- 1.51-11.97 +/- 1.61) increased, whereas serum MDA (5.62 +/-
      1.18-3.42 +/- 1.01) decreased significantly in resveratrol group (p <0.001).
      Moreover, resveratrol supplementation significantly decreased disease activity
      and increased the quality of life (p <0.001). CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that 
      500 mg/day resveratrol supplementation can improve the disease activity and
      quality of life in patients with UC at least partially through reduction of
      oxidative stress. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal dosage of
      supplementation for these patients.

AB  - The concept of prebiotics, probiotics, and symbiotics and their use in different 
      situations of daily clinical practice related to clinical nutrition is reviewed, 
      as well as their role in the treatment/prevention of diarrhea (acute, induced by 
      antibiotics, secondary to radiotherapy), inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative
      colitis and pouchitis), in colonic health (constipation, irritable bowel), in
      liver disease (steatosis and minimum encephalopathy), and in intensive care,
      surgical, and liver transplantation. While their effectiveness for preventing
      antibiotic-induced diarrhea and pouchitis in ulcerative colitis appears to be
      shown, additional studies are needed to establish recommendations in most
      clinical settings. The risk of infection associated to use of probiotics is
      relatively low; however, there are selected groups of patients in whom they
      should be used with caution (as jejunum infusion).

TI  - The long-term effects of probiotics in the therapy of ulcerative colitis: A
      clinical study.
PG  - 372-7
LID - 10.5507/bp.2016.044 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Intestinal dysbiosis seems to be the leading cause of inflammatory bowel
      diseases, and probiotics seems to represent the proper support against their
      occurrence. Actually, probiotic blends and anti-inflammatory drugs represent a
      weapon against inflammatory bowel diseases. The present study evaluates the
      long-term (2 years) effects of combination therapy (mesalazine plus a probiotic
      blend of Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium 
      bifidus strain BGN4) on ulcerative colitis activity. METHOD: Sixty patients with 
      moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were enrolled: 30 of them were treated with
      a single daily oral administration of mesalazine 1200 mg; 30 patients received a 
      single daily oral administration of mesalazine 1200 mg and a double daily
      administration of a probiotic blend of Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus
      acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidus strain BGN4. The treatment was carried
      out for two years and the clinical response evaluated according to the Modified
      Mayo Disease Activity Index. RESULTS: All patients treated with combination
      therapy showed better improvement compared to the controls. In particular, the
      beneficial effects of probiotics were evident even after two years of treatment. 
      CONCLUSIONS: A long-term treatment modality of anti-inflammatory drugs and
      probiotics is viable and could be an alternative to corticosteroids in mild-to
      moderate ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Modulation of microbiota as treatment for intestinal inflammatory disorders: An
      uptodate.
PG  - 7186-202
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i32.7186 [doi]
AB  - Alterations of intestinal microflora may significantly contribute to the
      pathogenesis of different inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. There is
      emerging interest on the role of selective modulation of microflora in inducing
      benefits in inflammatory intestinal disorders, by as probiotics, prebiotics,
      synbiotics, antibiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). To summarize
      recent evidences on microflora modulation in main intestinal inflammatory
      disorders, PubMed was searched using terms microbiota, intestinal flora,
      probiotics, prebiotics, fecal transplantation. More than three hundred articles
      published up to 2015 were selected and reviewed. Randomized placebo-controlled
      trials and meta-analysis were firstly included, mainly for probiotics. A
      meta-analysis was not performed because of the heterogeneity of these studies.
      Most of relevant data derived from studies on probiotics, reporting some efficacy
      in ulcerative colitis and in pouchitis, while disappointing results are available
      for Crohn's disease. Probiotic supplementation may significantly reduce rates of 
      rotavirus diarrhea. Efficacy of probiotics in NSAID enteropathy and irritable
      bowel syndrome is still controversial. Finally, FMT has been recently recognized 
      as an efficacious treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection.
      Modulation of intestinal flora represents a very interesting therapeutic target, 
      although it still deserves some doubts and limitations. Future studies should be 
      encouraged to provide new understanding about its therapeutical role.

TI  - Elucidating the gut microbiome of ulcerative colitis: bifidobacteria as novel
      microbial biomarkers.
LID - 10.1093/femsec/fiw191 [doi]
LID - fiw191 [pii]
AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) is associated with a substantial alteration of specific
      gut commensals, some of which may be involved in microbiota-mediated protection. 
      In this study, microbiota cataloging of UC patients by 16S rRNA microbial
      profiling revealed a marked reduction of bifidobacteria, in particular the
      Bifidobacterium bifidum species, thus suggesting that this taxon plays a
      biological role in the aetiology of UC. We investigated this further through an
      in vivo trial by testing the effects of oral treatment with B. bifidum PRL2010 in
      a wild-type murine colitis model. TNBS-treated mice receiving 10(9) cells of B.
      bifidum PRL2010 showed a marked reduction of all colitis-associated histological 
      indices as well as maintenance of mucosal integrity as it was shown by the
      increase in the expression of many tight junction-encoding genes. The protective 
      role of B. bifidum PRL2010, as well as its sortase-dependent pili, appears to be 
      established through the induction of an innate immune response of the host. These
      results highlight the importance of B. bifidum as a microbial biomarker for UC,
      revealing its role in protection against experimentally induced colitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Food oral immunotherapy (OIT) involves the administration of the food
      allergen causing the symptoms, in order to induce tolerance. Primary eosinophilic
      gastrointestinal disorders (PEGDs) are characterised by an eosinophil-rich
      inflammation affecting different locations of the digestive tract. We present a
      series of patients with PEGDs in a group of children following OIT with milk
      and/or egg. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective study during the period 2006-2014
      was performed in paediatric patients subjected to OIT with milk and/or egg. When 
      these children present persistent gastrointestinal symptoms, they are referred to
      the Paediatric Gastroenterology Unit for evaluation. RESULTS: Primary
      eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders were diagnosed in eight of the 128 cases 
      of OIT (6.25%). The time to PEGDs development was variable: two cases showed
      symptoms during OIT, and the rest with a median time of 29 months (15-48 months).
      Food treatment discontinuation was not required in four of the five cases of
      eosinophilic oesophagitis, although food removal was necessary in patients with
      eosinophilic gastroenteritis. CONCLUSIONS: We report the highest prevalence of
      PEGDs in children subjected to OIT, and the first cases of eosinophilic
      gastroenteritis following food OIT. The monitoring of new digestive signs and
      symptoms after OIT is crucial for the diagnosis of these disorders, and prolonged
      follow-up is required. The management of such patients and the need or not to
      eliminate the food should be assessed on an individualised basis, according to
      the severity of the condition, its evolution and response to different treatment 
      alternatives.

TI  - A Quantitative Analysis of FDA Adverse Event Reports with Oral Bisphosphonates
      and Clostridium difficile.
PG  - 1095-1101
LID - 10.1002/phar.1832 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies have shown associations between Clostridium difficile
      infection (CDI) and non-antimicrobial medications including proton pump
      inhibitors, osteoporosis medications, and antidepressants. OBJECTIVES: Our
      primary objective was to evaluate oral bisphosphonates and reported CDI adverse
      drug reactions in the United States using the Food and Drug Administration
      Adverse Event Reporting System data (FAERS). METHODS: We performed a
      disproportionality analysis evaluating the proportion of reports with
      bisphosphonates and CDI compared with other adverse drug reactions in the
      database. A relatively increased number of reports for a given adverse drug
      reaction (ADR) is termed a "signal." Four major measures of association are used 
      to describe reports: reporting odds ratio, proportional reporting ratio,
      information component, and empirical Bayes geometric mean. Drugs with
      statistically significant safety signals were stratified by age (18-40, 41-65,
      and 65+ years) and gender. RESULTS: Alendronate had 0.4% (103/23,603) reports
      with CDI. There were 0.4% (16/3672) and 0.2% (17/7945) of reports for risedronate
      and ibandronate, respectively. Alendronate (Fosamax) was the only drug with a
      significant signal using all four calculation methods. For reports with gender
      available, alendronate CDI ADRs were more common for women (0.45% [93/20,586])
      versus men (0.25% [4/1568]), and a signal was detected with all four methods. For
      reports with age available, there were limited alendronate reports for those
      18-39 years of age, and CDI reports were present in 0.50% (27/5350) of cases of
      40-64 years and 0.49% (42/8525) of cases aged 65 or older. CONCLUSION:
      Alendronate was associated with a high number of CDI ADRs relative to other drugs
      in FAERS. This signal was strongest for women and those 40 years or older. This
      interesting finding should be interpreted with caution, and further research is
      warranted.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic pathology that has an outbreaks
      course that in recent years have seen an increase in incidence, especially at
      younger ages. Malnutrition is frequently associated with this condition,
      therefore, it is very important to ensure a right nutritional intervention,
      especially in pediatric patients, to ensure an optimal growth and also an
      improvement in the clinic. Our goal will be updated the role of nutrition in this
      disease and in its treatment based on the published evidence. Malnutrition in
      these patients is frequent and is influenced by various factors such as,
      decreased food intake, increased nutrient requirements, increased protein loss
      and malabsorption of nutrients. Therefore there should be a nutritional
      monitoring of all of them, in which anthropometric measurements, laboratory tests
      and densitometry were made to establish the needs and sufficient caloric intake
      tailored to each patient. The use of enteral nutrition as a treatment in Crohn's 
      disease with mild to moderate outbreak in child population, is amply
      demonstrated, has even shown to be superior to the use of corticosteroids.
      Therefore we can conclude by stressing that nutritional intervention is a
      mainstay in the management of patients with IBD, which aims to prevent and / or
      control disease-related malnutrition to decrease morbidity and mortality and
      improve quality of life.

TI  - Presumed Allergic Proctocolitis Resolves with Probiotic Monotherapy: A Report of 
      4 Cases.
PG  - 621-4
AB  - BACKGROUND The prevalence of allergic diseases has been dramatically rising in
      the United States and other developed nations over recent decades. Growing
      evidence suggests a partial role for the microbiome in the development of these
      allergic diseases. Food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis (AP) (also
      referred to as cow's milk protein intolerance or allergy) is among the earliest
      and most common food allergic diseases of infancy, yet its pathophysiology is not
      well understood. The currently accepted clinical practice is to restrict the diet
      until 12 months of age. CASE REPORT We present 4 cases of clinically diagnosed AP
      whose symptoms quickly and completely resolved with probiotic Lactobacillus
      rhamnosus GG (LGG) monotherapy. All 4 infants avoided any dietary restrictions.
      The range of time from probiotic initiation to symptom resolution was 7-28 days. 
      CONCLUSIONS These cases suggest an important role for the infant intestinal
      microbiome in the development of gastrointestinal mucosal food allergies such as 
      AP. Prospective investigation of the intestinal microbiome in infants with AP may
      further our understanding of this disease's pathogenesis. The potential use of
      probiotic monotherapy in the treatment of AP also warrants further investigation.

AB  - On February 9, 2016, the Food and Drug Administration Arthritis Advisory
      Committee recommended by a vote of 21 to 3, that the biosimilar to infliximab,
      CT-P13, be approved for rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis and, by
      extrapolation, for all the indications for which infliximab is currently
      approved, including adult and pediatric ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.
      On April 5, 2016, the Food and Drug Administration concurred with this
      recommendation and approved CT-P13 (Inflectra; Pfizer Inc.) for all diseases for 
      which infliximab had previously been approved, including adult and pediatric
      moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and pediatric and adult moderate to severe 
      and fistulizing Crohn's disease. This was despite the absence of any randomized
      controlled trials studying the infliximab biosimilar in any inflammatory bowel
      disease. This highly controversial approach has been criticized by various
      rheumatology and gastroenterology professional societies around the world. This
      review will cover the stepwise approach to biosimilar development, issues of
      extrapolation and interchangeability, and conclude with a discussion of the
      regulatory, intellectual property issues, and financial implications, which will 
      all intersect in the decision and ability to prescribe a biosimilar or reference 
      anti-tumor necrosis factor drug.

TI  - Dual effects of a high-protein diet on DSS-treated mice during colitis resolution
      phase.
PG  - G624-G633
LID - 10.1152/ajpgi.00433.2015 [doi]
AB  - The impact of the dietary protein level on the process of colonic mucosal
      inflammation and subsequent recovery remains largely unknown. In this study, we
      fed DSS-treated mice with either a normoproteic (NP) or a high-protein (HP)
      isocaloric diet from the beginning of the 5-day dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)
      treatment to 14 days later. Measurements of colitis indicators (colon
      weight:length ratio, myeloperoxidase activity, cytokine expressions) showed a
      similar level of colonic inflammation in both DSS groups during the colitis
      induction phase. However, during the colitis resolution phase, inflammation
      intensity was higher in the DSS-HP group than in the DSS-NP group as evidenced by
      higher inflammatory score and body weight loss. This coincided with a higher
      mortality rate. In surviving animals, an increase in colonic crypt height
      associated with a higher number of colon epithelial cells per crypt, and
      TGF-beta3 content was observed in the DSS-HP vs. DSS-NP group. Moreover, colonic 
      expression patterns of tight junction proteins and E-cadherin were also different
      according to the diet. Altogether, our results indicate that the HP diet, when
      given during both the induction and resolution periods of DSS-induced colitis,
      showed deleterious effects during the post-induction phase. However, HP diet
      ingestion was also associated with morphological and biochemical differences
      compatible with higher colonic epithelium restoration in surviving animals,
      indicating an effect of the dietary protein level on colonic crypt repair after
      acute inflammation. These data highlight the potential impact of the dietary
      protein amount during the colitis course.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has become a 'prototype disease' for chronic
      auto-inflammatory disorders with a polygenic background and important
      multifaceted environmental trigger components. The environmental factors
      contribute both to pathogenesis and disease flares. Thus, IBD is a disease par
      excellence to study the interactions between host genetics, environmental factors
      (such as infections or smoking) and 'in-vironmental' factors - for example, our
      intestinal microbiota. Longitudinal intercurrent events, including the impact of 
      long-term medication on disease progression or stabilization, can exemplarily be 
      studied in this disease group. Whilst alterations in the human genome coding
      relevant variant protein products have most likely not emerged significantly over
      the last 50 years, the incidence of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis has
      dramatically increased in Western countries and more recently in the Asia Pacific
      area. An interesting concept indicates that 'Western lifestyle factors' trigger
      chronic intestinal inflammation or disease flares in a genetically susceptible
      host. To understand the disease pathogenesis as well as triggers for flares or
      determinants of disease courses, we must further investigate potential
      en(in)vironmental factors. As environmental conditions, in contrast to genetic
      risk factors, can be influenced, knowledge on those risk factors becomes crucial 
      to modulate disease incidence, disease course or clinical presentation. It is
      obvious that prevention of environmentally triggered disease flares would be a
      goal most relevant for IBD patients. An increased prevalence of IBD in urban
      environment has been documented in Switzerland by the Swiss IBD cohort study.
      Several studies have attempted to identify such factors; however, only a few have
      been validated. The best investigated environmental factor identified in IBD
      cohort analyses is smoking. Other environmental factors that have been associated
      with clinical presentation or risk of inflammatory flares as well as increased
      incidence are diet and food additives. The so-called 'hygiene hypothesis'
      suggests that increased hygiene in childhood associated with reduced exposure to 
      pathogens may leave the mucosal immune system insufficiently trained and thus
      prone to uncontrolled inflammation. Oral contraceptives and non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs are the 2 main classes of frequently taken drugs that
      have been attributed to have the potential to cause flares of the disease. What
      is likely to be the connection between the genetic susceptibility and the
      environmental triggers? There is broad evidence for a critical role of the
      commensal enteric microbiota as a modulator of immunologic responses relevant
      during onset and chronification of IBD.

TI  - Postoperative Outcomes in Vedolizumab-Treated Patients Undergoing Abdominal
      Operations for Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
PG  - 185-190
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjw147 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vedolizumab was recently approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis [UC]
      and Crohn's disease [CD]. No study to date has examined the rate of postoperative
      infectious complications among patients who received vedolizumab in the
      perioperative period. We sought to determine the 30-day postoperative infectious 
      complication rate among inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] patients who received
      vedolizumab within 12 weeks of an abdominal operation as compared to patients who
      received tumour necrosis factor alpha [TNFalpha] inhibitors or no biological
      therapy. METHODS: A retrospective chart review between May 1, 2014 and December
      31, 2015 of adult IBD patients who underwent an abdominal operation was
      performed. The study cohort comprised patients who received vedolizumab within 12
      weeks of their abdominal operation and the control cohorts were patients who
      received TNFalpha inhibitors or no biological therapy. RESULTS: In total, 94
      patients received vedolizumab within 12 weeks of an abdominal operation. Fifty
      experienced postoperative complications [53%], 35 of which were surgical site
      infections [SSIs] [36%]. The vedolizumab group experienced significantly higher
      rates of any postoperative infection [53% vs 33% anti-TNF and 28% non-biologics; 
      p<0.001] and SSI [37% vs 10% and 13%; p<0.001]. On univariate and multivariate
      analysis, exposure to vedolizumab remained a significant predictor of
      postoperative SSI [p<0.001]. CONCLUSIONS: Thirty-seven per cent of IBD patients
      who received vedolizumab within 30 days of a major abdominal operation
      experienced a 30-day postoperative SSI, significantly higher than patients
      receiving TNFalpha inhibitors or no biological therapy. Vedolizumab within 12
      weeks of surgery remained the only predictor of 30-day postoperative SSI on
      multivariate analysis.

PG  - 2078-97
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000847 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Beneficial roles for glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)/GLP-1R signaling
      have recently been described in diseases, where low-grade inflammation is a
      common phenomenon. We investigated the effects of GLP-1 in Brunner's glands and
      duodenum with abundant expression of GLP-1 receptors, as well as GLP-1 effect on 
      colonic inflammation. METHODS: RNA from Brunner's glands of GLP-1R knockout and
      wild-type mice were subjected to full transcriptome profiling. Array results were
      validated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in
      wild-type mice and compared with samples from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      patients and controls. In addition, we performed a detailed investigation of the 
      effects of exogenous liraglutide dosing in a T-cell driven adoptive transfer
      (AdTr) colitis mouse model. RESULTS: Analyses of the Brunner's gland
      transcriptomes of GLP-1R knockout and wild-type mice identified 722
      differentially expressed genes. Upregulated transcripts after GLP-1 dosing
      included IL-33, chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20), and mucin 5b. Biopsies from IBD
      patients and controls, as well as data from the AdTr model, showed deregulated
      expression of GLP-1R, CCL20, and IL-33 in colon. Circulating levels of GLP-1 were
      found to be increased in mice with colitis. Finally, the colonic cytokine levels 
      and disease scores of the AdTr model indicated reduced levels of colonic
      inflammation in liraglutide-dosed animals. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that
      IL-33, GLP-1R, and CCL20 are deregulated in human IBD, and that prophylactic
      treatment with 0.6 mg/kg liraglutide improves disease in AdTr colitis. In
      addition, GLP-1 receptor agonists upregulate IL-33, mucin 5b, and CCL20 in murine
      Brunner's glands. Taken together, our data indicate that GLP-1 receptor agonists 
      affect gut homeostasis in both proximal and distal parts of the gut.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As a sulfated polysaccharide, carrageenan has been widely used as
      common food additive. METHODS: In the present study, we investigated the effects 
      of kappa-carrageenan on TNBS-induced gut inflammation in mice. BALB/c mice were
      pretreated with kappa-carrageenan for 14days prior to the administration of TNBS.
      RESULTS: Our results showed that kappa-carrageenan pretreatment aggravated the
      loss of body weight and further increased the mortality rate. Histological and
      morphological analyses revealed that the TNBS-induced colonic inflammation was
      deteriorated by the kappa-carrageenan administration. The ratio of
      CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127dim/CD4(+) of the kappa-carrageenan+TNBS groups was
      significantly lower than that of the TNBS group. The expression of IL-2,
      TNF-alpha and IL-6 was significantly increased, whereas the expression of IL-10
      was significantly decreased in the kappa-carrageenan+TNBS groups. In addition,
      kappa-carrageenan, together with TNBS, decreased the enzyme activity of SOD and
      GSH-px and up-regulated the expression of TLR4, NF-kappaB, p-ERK, p-JNK, p-Jun., 
      IL-8 and MDA in the colonic mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: kappa-Carrageenan aggravated the
      TNBS-induced intestinal inflammation, and such an effect could be associated with
      the oxidative stress and activation of TLR4-NF-kappaB and MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an intestinal chronic
      inflammatory condition and includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis
      (UC). It has been proposed that Vitamin D supplementation may have a beneficial
      role in IBD. AIM: To characterize the effects of Vitamin D on cathelicidin
      (hCAP/LL37) gene expression, ESR, and serum hs-CRP levels. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Ninety UC patients on remission were randomized to receive 300,000 IU
      intramuscular Vitamin D or 1 mL normal saline as placebo, respectively. Before
      and 90 days after intervention, serum levels of 25 (OH)-Vitamin D3, PTH, Calcium,
      ESR, and hs-CRP were measured. Cathelicidin gene expression was also quantified
      using qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Baseline serum 25-OH-Vitamin D3 levels were not different
      between the two groups and after intervention, increased only in Vitamin D group 
      (P < 0.001). Hs-CRP levels were lower in Vitamin D group after intervention
      (Before: 3.43 +/- 3.47 vs 3.86 +/- 3.55 mg/L, P = 0.56; after: 2.31 +/- 2.25 vs
      3.90 +/- 3.97 mg/L, P= 0.023). ESR decreased significantly in Vitamin D group
      (Before: 12.4 +/- 6.1 vs 12.1 +/- 5.3 mm/h, P= 0.77; after: 6.7 +/- 4.5 vs 11.4
      +/- 5.5 mm/h, P< 0.001). The mean fold change in hCAP18 gene expression in
      Vitamin D group was significantly higher than placebo group. (Mean +/- SD: 3.13
      +/- 2.56 vs 1.09 +/- 0.56; median +/- interquartile range: 2.17 +/- 3.81 vs 0.87 
      +/- 0.53, P< 0.001). CONCLUSION: Decreases in ESR and hs-CRP levels and increase 
      in LL37 gene expression support the hypothesis that Vitamin D supplementation may
      have a beneficial role in UC patients.

TI  - Adverse Events Associated with Immune Checkpoint Blockade in Patients with
      Cancer: A Systematic Review of Case Reports.
PG  - e0160221
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0160221 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Three checkpoint inhibitor drugs have been approved by the US Food
      and Drug Administration for use in specific types of cancers. While the results
      are promising, severe immunotherapy-related adverse events (irAEs) have been
      reported. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a systematic review of case reports describing
      the occurrence of irAEs in patients with cancer following checkpoint blockade
      therapy, primarily to identify potentially unrecognized or unusual clinical
      findings and toxicity. DATA SOURCES: We searched Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science,
      PubMed ePubs, and Cochrane CENTRAL with no restriction through August 2015. STUDY
      SELECTION: Studies reporting cases of cancer develop irAEs following treatment
      with anti CTLA-4 (ipilimumab) or anti PD-1 (nivolumab or pembrolizumab)
      antibodies were included. DATA EXTRACTION: We extracted data on patient
      characteristics, irAEs characteristics, how irAEs were managed, and their
      outcomes. DATA SYNTHESIS: 191 publications met inclusion criteria, reporting on
      251 cases. Most patients had metastatic melanoma (95.6%), and the majority were
      treated with ipilimumab (93.2%). Autoimmune colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies,
      and cutaneous irAEs were the most frequently reported irAEs in ipilimumab treated
      patients. A broad spectrum of toxicities were reported for almost every body
      system. Moreover, well-defined diseases such as sarcoidosis, polyarthritis,
      polymyalgia rheumatica/arteritis, lupus, celiac disease, dermatomyositis, and
      Vogt-Koyanagi-like syndrome were reported. The most frequent irAEs reported with 
      anti-PD1 agents were dermatitis for pembrolizumab, and thyroid disease and
      pneumonitis for nivolumab. Complete resolution of adverse events occurred in most
      cases. However, persistent irAEs and death were reported, mainly in patients
      treated with ipilimumab. LIMITATIONS: Our study is limited by information
      available in the original reports. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from case reports shows 
      that cancer patients develop irAEs following checkpoint blockade therapy, and can
      occasionally develop clearly defined autoimmune systemic diseases. While
      discontinuation of therapy and/or treatment can result in resolution of irAEs,
      long-term sequelae and death have been reported.

TI  - A secretome view of colonisation factors in Shiga toxin-encoding Escherichia coli
      (STEC): from enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) to related enteropathotypes.
LID - 10.1093/femsle/fnw179 [doi]
LID - fnw179 [pii]
AB  - Shiga toxin-encoding Escherichia coli (STEC) regroup strains that carry genes
      encoding Shiga toxin (Stx). Among intestinal pathogenic E. coli,
      enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) constitute the major subgroup of virulent STEC.
      EHEC cause serious human disease such as haemorrhagic colitis and
      haemolytic-uremic syndrome. While EHEC have evolved from enteropathogenic E.
      coli, hybrids with enteroaggregative E. coli have recently emerged. Of note, some
      enteroinvasive E. coli also belong to the STEC group. While the LEE (locus of
      enterocyte effacement) is a key and prominent molecular determinant in the
      pathogenicity, neither all EHEC nor STEC contain the LEE, suggesting that they
      possess additional virulence and colonisation factors. Currently, nine protein
      secretion systems have been described in diderm-lipopolysaccharide bacteria
      (archetypal Gram-negative) and can be involved in the secretion of extracellular 
      effectors, cell-surface proteins or assembly of cell-surface organelles, such as 
      flagella or pili. In this review, we focus on the secretome of STEC and related
      enteropathotypes, which are relevant to the colonisation of biotic and abiotic
      surfaces. Considering the wealth of potential protein trafficking mechanisms, the
      different combinations of colonisation factors and modulation of their expression
      is further emphasised with regard to the ecophysiology of STEC.

TI  - Anti-food and anti-microbial IgG subclass antibodies in inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 1453-1461
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly Crohn's disease (CD), 
      is associated with increased microbial-specific IgG and IgA antibodies, whereas
      alterations of anti-food antibodies are still disputed. The knowledge about IgG
      subclass antibodies in IBD is limited. In this study we analysed IgG subclass
      antibodies specific for nutritional and commensal antigens in IBD patients and
      controls. METHODS: Serum IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 specific for wheat and milk
      extracts, purified ovalbumin, Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis lysates
      and mannan from Saccharomyces cerevisiae were analysed by ELISA in patients with 
      CD (n = 56), ulcerative colitis (UC; n = 29), acute gastroenteritis/colitis (n = 
      12) as well as non-inflammatory controls (n = 62). RESULTS: Anti-Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) of all IgG subclasses and anti-B. fragilis IgG1
      levels were increased in CD patients compared to UC patients and controls. The
      discriminant validity of ASCA IgG2 and IgG4 was comparable with that of ASCA
      pan-IgG and IgA, whereas it was inferior for ASCA IgG1/IgG3 and anti-B. fragilis 
      IgG1. Complicated CD defined by the presence of perianal, stricturing or
      penetrating disease phenotypes was associated with increased ASCA IgG1/IgG3/IgG4,
      anti-B. fragilis IgG1 and anti-E. coli IgG1 levels. Anti-food IgG subclass levels
      were not different between IBD patients and controls and did not correlate with
      food intolerance. In contrast to anti-microbial Abs, food-specific IgG responses 
      were predominately of the IgG4 isotype and all food-specific IgG subclass levels 
      correlated negatively with age. CONCLUSION: Our study supports the notion that
      the adaptive immune recognition of food and commensal antigens are differentially
      regulated.

TI  - Food intolerance prevalence in active ulcerative colitis in southwest China.
PG  - 529-33
LID - 10.6133/apjcn.102015.04 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Food intolerance is believed to be a source of
      frequent medical problems in ulcerative colitis (UC), which closely correlate
      with patients' dietary pattern. Living in an underdeveloped area of China,
      residents in southwestern region have diverse dietary habits. The objective of
      this study is to determine the prevalence of food intolerance in the UC patients 
      in this area and to discuss some of the possible risk factors leading to the
      condition. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Food antibodies in serum of 80 patients with
      active UC were determined by standard enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA).
      This study examined the risk factors contributing to high titers of food
      antibodies and the dietary patterns correlating with food intolerance in these
      demographics. RESULTS: 83.8% of patients (67/80) were found to be seropositive
      for food intolerance. Patients of female, aged between 20 to 40 and the one who
      tended to have a high fat diet were tested to be highly seropositive (p<0.05).
      Neither spicy food intake nor the course the disease manifested any relationship 
      with the presence of food intolerance (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Active UC patients in
      southwestern region of China have showed to be high seropositive in food
      intolerance, particularly in female and young patients. Dietary patterns with
      high in fat intake seem to have caused high prevalence of seropositivity in food 
      intolerance. Although rice has been taken as staple food and the spicy food has
      been popular among citizen in this region, these foods have indicated to no
      effect on food intolerance in this study.

TI  - Enterococcus durans TN-3 Induces Regulatory T Cells and Suppresses the
      Development of Dextran Sulfate Sodium (DSS)-Induced Experimental Colitis.
PG  - e0159705
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0159705 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Probiotic properties of Enterococcus strains have been
      reported previously. In this study, we investigated the effects of Enterococcus
      (E.) durans TN-3 on the development of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis.
      METHODS: BALB/c mice were fed with 4.0% DSS in normal chow. Administration of
      TN-3 (10mg/day) was initiated 7days before the start of DSS feeding. Mucosal
      cytokine expression was analyzed by real time-PCR and immunohistochemistry. The
      lymphocyte subpopulation were analyzed by flow cytometry. The gut microbiota
      profile was analyzed by a terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism
      method (T-RFLP). RESULTS: The disease activity index and histological colitis
      score were significantly lower in the DSS plus TN-3 group than in the DSS group. 
      The mucosal mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-17A 
      and IFN-gamma) decreased significantly in the DSS plus TN-3 group as compared to 
      the DSS group. The proportion of regulatory T cells (Treg cells) in the mucosa
      increased significantly in the DSS plus TN-3 group as compared to the DSS group. 
      Both fecal butyrate levels and the diversity of fecal microbial community were
      significantly higher in the TN-3 plus DSS group than in the DSS group.
      CONCLUSIONS: E. durans TN-3 exerted an inhibitory effect on the development of
      DSS colitis. This action might be mediated by the induction of Treg cells and the
      restoration of the diversity of the gut microbiota.

      Trials.
PG  - NP110-26
LID - 10.1177/2156587216658846 [doi]
AB  - The clinical effectiveness and value of camel milk as a therapeutic agent is
      currently unclear. MEDLINE (1946 to March 2016), EMBASE (1974 to March 2016), and
      Google Scholar were searched using the following terms: milk, bodily secretions, 
      camels, camelus, camelini, camelidae, dromedary, bactrian camel, body fluid, and 
      bodily secretions. Articles identified were reviewed if the study was
      investigating the use of camel milk for the potential treatment of diseases
      affecting humans. Of 430 studies, 24 were included after assessment. Identified
      studies highlighted treatment with camel milk of diseases, including diabetes,
      autism, cancer, various infections, heavy metal toxicity, colitis, and
      alcohol-induced toxicity. Although most studies using both the human and animal
      model do show a clinical benefit with an intervention and camel milk, limitations
      of these studies must be taken into consideration before widespread use. Based on
      the evidence, camel milk should not replace standard therapies for any indication
      in humans.

PG  - 500-3
LID - 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0578-1310.2016.07.005 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the efficacy and safety of the application of enteral
      nutrition (EN) in gastrointestinal disease in children, and to explore the
      possibility of the implementation of family EN. METHOD: Retrospective analysis of
      disease spectrum, EN approach, preparation, speed and time as well as adverse
      reactions and outcomes in 47 pediatric patients with gastrointestinal disease
      underwent EN therapy during July 2014 to March 2015. The nutrition indicators
      before and after EN therapy were compared by paired t-test. RESULT: A total of 47
      patients were selected, 27 male (57%) and 20 female (43%), aged 0.8 (0.3, 4.0)
      years, 9 with mechanical or chemical damage to the esophagus, 7 with inflammatory
      bowel disease (including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease), 6 with chronic 
      diarrhea, 5 with acute pancreatitis, 3 with acute diarrhea and severe
      malnutrition, 3 with short bowel syndrome, 3 with improper feeding, 3 with
      feeding difficulties, 3 with protein losing enteropathy, 2 with post-enterostomy,
      2 with enterocolitis, 1 with gastroesophageal reflux, were diagnosed. Of 47
      cases, 22 were given oral nutrition, 28 were fed with nasogastric tube and 4 with
      nasojejunal tube feeding, 2 with percutaneous endoscopic gastrojejunostomy tube
      feeding for each. In these tube-feeding cases, 20 cases were treated with
      continuous infusion and 21 cases with intermittent infusion. Eleven cases were
      fed with amino acid formula; 21 cases took the choice of peptide formulations; 16
      cases chose whole protein formula, including six cases who chose 3.3-4.2 kJ/ml
      higher energy density formula, 10 cases selected common energy density formula
      including breast milk. Twenty-one cases suffered from different degrees of
      adverse reactions, including vomiting in 7 cases, abdominal pain and bloating in 
      3, diarrhea in 12, secondary respiratory infections in 5. Five patients were
      discharged after giving up of treatment by parents due to poor efficacy on
      primary disease; 3 cases were transferred to other departments for further
      treatment; 15 cases were discharged with a feeding tube for family nutrition and 
      specialist out-patient treatment. The rest 24 cases were all improved and
      discharged. There were significant differences in nutrition indicators before and
      after EN, weight-for-age Z score (WAZ)(-2.3+/-1.9 vs. -1.9+/-1.8, t=4.156,
      P=0.000), weight-for-height Z score (WHZ)(-1.9+/-1.7 vs. -1.2+/-1.5, t=3.714,
      P=0.001), albumin ((35+/-9)g/L vs.(39+/-6) g/L, t=3.017, P=0.005) and prealbumin 
      ((0.11+/-0.05)g/L vs.(0.18+/-0.07)g/L, t=5.144, P=0.000). CONCLUSION: EN is
      suitable for a variety of children's digestive diseases, which can improve the
      nutritional status of the patients and was safe for clinical application. As the 
      implementation of EN is simple and has good compliance, family EN is proven to be
      feasible.

TI  - Treatment of the Immune-Related Adverse Effects of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors: 
      A Review.
PG  - 1346-1353
LID - 10.1001/jamaoncol.2016.1051 [doi]
AB  - Importance: The development of immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting cytotoxic
      T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) has
      significantly improved the treatment of a variety of cancers and led to US Food
      and Drug Administration approvals for patients with a variety of malignant
      neoplasms. Immune checkpoint inhibitors enhance antitumor immunity by blocking
      negative regulators of T-cell function that exist both on immune cells and on
      tumor cells. Although these agents can lead to remarkable responses, their use
      can also be associated with unique immune-related adverse effects (irAEs).
      Observations: In general, use of PD-1 inhibitors such as nivolumab and
      pembrolizumab has a lower incidence of irAEs compared with those that block
      CTLA-4 such as ipilimumab. The combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab has a
      higher rate of irAEs than either approach as monotherapy. Consensus guidelines
      regarding the treatment of the most common irAEs including rash, colitis,
      hepatitis, endocrinopathies, and pneumonitis have been established. The mainstay 
      of irAE treatment consists of immunosuppression with corticosteroids or other
      immunosuppressant agents such as infliximab; most irAEs will resolve with
      appropriate management. Conclusions and Relevance: The clinical use of immune
      checkpoint inhibitors is expanding rapidly. Oncology practitioners will therefore
      be required to recognize and manage irAEs in a growing patient population. Early 
      recognition and treatment are essential to prevent patient morbidity and
      mortality, and adherence to established algorithms is recommended.

TI  - FolC2-mediated folate metabolism contributes to suppression of inflammation by
      probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri.
PG  - 802-818
LID - 10.1002/mbo3.371 [doi]
AB  - Bacterial-derived compounds from the intestinal microbiome modulate host mucosal 
      immunity. Identification and mechanistic studies of these compounds provide
      insights into host-microbial mutualism. Specific Lactobacillus reuteri strains
      suppress production of the proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor (TNF),
      and are protective in a mouse model of colitis. Human-derived L. reuteri strain
      ATCC PTA 6475 suppresses intestinal inflammation and produces
      5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolic acid polyglutamates. Insertional mutagenesis
      identified the bifunctional dihydrofolate synthase/folylpolyglutamate synthase
      type 2 (folC2) gene as essential for 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolic acid
      polyglutamate biosynthesis, as well as for suppression of TNF production by
      activated human monocytes, and for the anti-inflammatory effect of L. reuteri
      6475 in a trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced mouse model of acute colitis. In 
      contrast, folC encodes the enzyme responsible for folate polyglutamylation but
      does not impact TNF suppression by L. reuteri. Comparative transcriptomics
      between wild-type and mutant L. reuteri strains revealed additional genes
      involved in immunomodulation, including previously identified hdc genes involved 
      in histidine to histamine conversion. The folC2 mutant yielded diminished hdc
      gene cluster expression and diminished histamine production, suggesting a link
      between folate and histadine/histamine metabolism. The identification of genes
      and gene networks regulating production of bacterial-derived immunoregulatory
      molecules may lead to improved anti-inflammatory strategies for digestive
      diseases.

TI  - Role and mechanisms of action of Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 in the maintenance 
      of remission in ulcerative colitis patients: An update.
PG  - 5505-11
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i24.5505 [doi]
AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease, whose etiology is
      still unclear. Its pathogenesis involves an interaction between genetic factors, 
      immune response and the "forgotten organ", Gut Microbiota. Several studies have
      been conducted to assess the role of antibiotics and probiotics as additional or 
      alternative therapies for Ulcerative Colitis. Escherichia coli Nissle (EcN) is a 
      nonpathogenic Gram-negative strain isolated in 1917 by Alfred Nissle and it is
      the active component of microbial drug Mutaflor((R)) (Ardeypharm GmbH, Herdecke, 
      Germany and EcN, Cadigroup, In Italy) used in many gastrointestinal disorder
      including diarrhea, uncomplicated diverticular disease and UC. It is the only
      probiotic recommended in ECCO guidelines as effective alternative to mesalazine
      in maintenance of remission in UC patients. In this review we propose an update
      on the role of EcN 1917 in maintenance of remission in UC patients, including
      data about efficacy and safety. Further studies may be helpful for this subject
      to further the full use of potential of EcN.

TI  - Lactobacillus curvatus WiKim38 isolated from kimchi induces IL-10 production in
      dendritic cells and alleviates DSS-induced colitis in mice.
PG  - 503-9
LID - 10.1007/s12275-016-6160-2 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria have healthpromoting effects
      by immune modulation. In the present study, we examined the immunomodulatory
      properties of Lactobacillus curvatus WiKim38, which was newly isolated from
      baechu (Chinese cabbage) kimchi. The ability of L. curvatus WiKim38 to induce
      cytokine production in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) was determined
      by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To evaluate the molecular mechanisms
      underlying L. curvatus Wikim38-mediated IL-10 production, Western blot analyses
      and inhibitor assays were performed. Moreover, the in vivo anti-inflammatory
      effects of L. curvatus WiKim38 were examined in a dextran sodium sulfate
      (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model. L. curvatus WiKim38 induced significantly
      higher levels of IL-10 in BMDCs compared with that induced by LPS. NF-kappaB and 
      ERK were activated by L. curvatus WiKim38, and an inhibitor assay revealed that
      these pathways were required for L. curvatus WiKim38-induced production of IL-10 
      in BMDCs. An in vivo experiment showed that oral administration of L. curvatus
      WiKim38 increased the survival rate of mice with DSS-induced colitis and improved
      clinical signs and histopathological severity in colon tissues. Taken together,
      these results indicate that L. curvatus Wikim38 may have health-promoting effects
      via immune modulation, and may thus be applicable for therapy of various
      inflammatory diseases.

AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the beneficial properties of a potentially probiotic yoghurt
      obtained by the fermentation of two selected anti-inflammatory bacterial strains 
      using in vivo mouse models of intestinal inflammation and colon carcinogenesis.
      METHODS AND RESULTS: Yoghurt was administered to mice suffering chemically
      induced intestinal inflammation or colon carcinogenesis. It was shown that this
      novel yoghurt was able to prevent local inflammation in the intestines of mice
      through a regulation of the immune response, prevent macroscopic and histological
      damages, and prevent colon carcinogenesis through an anti-inflammatory response. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The developed yoghurt showed in vivo anti-inflammatory properties by
      modulation of the host immune response for the prevention of colon inflammation
      and carcinogenesis. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This new yoghurt could 
      thus be considered a probiotic food and be useful as a complement to current
      treatment protocols for inflammatory bowel diseases and colon cancer, a first
      since there are no current functional foods specifically oriented for these
      patients.

TI  - Potential Benefits of Dietary Fibre Intervention in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
LID - 10.3390/ijms17060919 [doi]
LID - E919 [pii]
AB  - Intestinal dysbiosis is thought to be an important cause of disease progression
      and the gastrointestinal symptoms experienced in patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). Inflammation appears to be a major contributor in perpetuating a
      dysregulated gut microbiota. Although current drug therapies can significantly
      induce and maintain disease remission, there is no cure for these diseases.
      Nevertheless, ongoing human studies investigating dietary fibre interventions may
      potentially prove to exert beneficial outcomes for IBD. Postulated mechanisms
      include direct interactions with the gut mucosa through immunomodulation, or
      indirectly through the microbiome. Component species of the microbiome may
      degrade dietary-fibre polysaccharides and ferment the products to form
      short-chain fatty acids such as butyrate. Prebiotic dietary fibres may also act
      more directly by altering the composition of the microbiome. Longer term benefits
      in reducing the risk of more aggressive disease or colorectal cancer may require 
      other dietary fibre sources such as wheat bran or psyllium. By critically
      examining clinical trials that have used dietary fibre supplements or dietary
      patterns containing specific types or amounts of dietary fibres, it may be
      possible to assess whether varying the intake of specific dietary fibres may
      offer an efficient treatment for IBD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Distinct CD8+ T-cell subsets such as interleukin-17-expressing Tc17
      and Foxp3-expressing Tcreg are functionally similar to CD4+ T cells. Though CD4+ 
      T cells are dysregulated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), CD8+ 
      T cells are not well investigated. Vitamin D is an environmental factor which
      influences T-cell subsets. We assessed the prevalence of CD8+ T-cell subsets
      among peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and lamina propria mononuclear
      cells (LPMC) of patients with Crohn's disease, patients with ulcerative colitis, 
      and healthy controls. We then tested the effect of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 
      on CD8+ T-cell subsets. METHODS: A total of 73 patients with Crohn's disease, 49 
      patients with ulcerative colitis, and 47 healthy controls were studied. LPMC or
      PBMC were isolated and flow cytometry was performed. CD3+ T cells, isolated from 
      PBMC, were cultured with or without 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, before flow
      cytometry. RESULTS: In LPMC, the prevalence of Tcreg was higher in patients with 
      IBD (P < 0.05), whereas Tc17 were higher in patients with ulcerative colitis
      compared with patients with Crohn's disease and healthy controls (P < 0.05). In
      PBMC, both Tcreg and Tc17 were higher in patients with IBD (P < 0.01).
      Double-expressing interferon-gamma+ interleukin-17+ and Foxp3+ interleukin-17+
      CD8+ T cells were also identified indicating possible CD8+ plasticity.
      1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 decreased interferon-gamma-expressing Tc1 (P <
      0.05), but had no effect on Tc17 or Tcreg. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of novel
      CD8+ T-cell subsets is altered in patients with IBD. Double-expressing cells
      indicate plasticity and were identified in patients with IBD. Vitamin D may have 
      a limited effect on CD8+ T cells by decreasing interferon-gamma expression.

AB  - Escherichia coli O157:H7 shed by clinically healthy ruminants has been linked to 
      hemorrhagic colitis and the hemolytic uremic syndrome in humans. The bacteria are
      spread mainly by contaminated food and water, contact with animals carrying the
      organisms, and person-to-person contact. Although many intervention strategies
      have been studied to reduce E. coli O157:H7 carriage in ruminants and its spread 
      into the environment, none of the available methods can completely eliminate the 
      infection. Therefore, there is need for new intervention strategies which will
      effectively reduce E. coli O157:H7 prevalence. Lactoferrin, a member of the
      transferrin protein family, is an iron-binding glycoprotein that is found in many
      exocrine secretions, including milk, tears, saliva, and serum. Lactoferrin has a 
      number of biological functions including antimicrobial and immunomodulatory
      effects. This review summarizes latest data on the antimicrobial effect of
      lactoferrin against E. coli O157:H7 in in vitro and in vivo studies.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis; Crohn's disease) are
      debilitating relapsing inflammatory disorders affecting the gastrointestinal
      tract, with deleterious effect on quality of life, and increasing incidence and
      prevalence. Mucosal inflammation, due to altered microbiota, increased intestinal
      permeability and immune system dysfunction underlies the symptoms and may be
      caused in susceptible individuals by different factors (or a combination of
      them), including dietary habits and components. In this review we describe the
      influence of the Western diet, obesity, and different nutraceuticals/functional
      foods (bioactive peptides, phytochemicals, omega 3-polyunsaturated fatty acids,
      vitamin D, probiotics and prebiotics) on the course of IBD, and provide some
      hints that could be useful for nutritional guidance. Hopefully, research will
      soon offer enough reliable data to slow down the spread of the disease and to
      make diet a cornerstone in IBD therapy.

TI  - Keratin 8-deletion induced colitis predisposes to murine colorectal cancer
      enforced by the inflammasome and IL-22 pathway.
PG  - 777-786

AB  - Keratins (K) are intermediate filament proteins important in protection from
      cellular stress. K8, K18 and K19 are the main components of keratin filaments in 
      colonic epithelia but their role in intestinal diseases remains ambiguous. A
      function for keratins in intestinal health is supported by the K8-knock-out
      (K8(-/-)) mouse which manifests an early chronic ulcerative colitis-like
      inflammatory bowel disease and epithelial hyperproliferation. We tested whether
      K8(-/-) mice are more susceptible to colorectal cancer (CRC) compared to K8 wild 
      type (K8(+/+)), and K8 heterozygote (K8(+/-)) mice showing increased
      proliferation but no inflammation. K8(-/-) mice did not develop CRC
      spontaneously, but had dramatically increased numbers of tumors in the distal
      colon in the azoxymethane (AOM) and Apc(Min/+) CRC models while neither K8(+/+)
      nor K8(+/-) mice were susceptible. Upregulation of IL-22 in combination with a
      complete loss of its negative regulator IL-22BP, and increased downstream
      STAT3-signaling in K8(-/-) and K8(-/-)Apc(Min/+) colonic epithelia confirmed that
      the IL-22 pathway, important in inflammation, proliferation and tissue
      regeneration, was activated. The nearly total loss of IL-22BP correlated with an 
      activated inflammasome leading to increased cleaved caspase-1, and the putative
      IL-22BP inhibitor, IL-18, as well as a decrease in ALDH1/2. Ablation of K8 in a
      colorectal cancer cell line similarly resulted in increased IL-18 and decreased
      ALDH1/2. K8/K18 co-immunoprecipitated with pro-caspase-1, a component of the
      inflammasome in the colon, which suggests that keratins modulate inflammasome
      activity and protect the colon from inflammation and tumorigenesis. The K8-null
      mouse models also provide novel epithelial-derived robust colon-specific CRC
      models.

PG  - 2585-92
LID - 10.1007/s10620-016-4203-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EOGE) is a rare idiopathic disease
      characterized by eosinophil-predominant inflammation of the stomach and/or
      intestines. Our aims are to determine the epidemiology, clinical features and
      outcomes of EOGE cases in a tertiary-care hospital. METHODS: Retrospective cohort
      study of patients with gastrointestinal eosinophilic infiltration from 2004
      through 2014. All relevant specimens were reviewed by an expert pathologist.
      Significant eosinophilic infiltrate was defined as >25 eosinophils/HPF in the
      stomach or small intestine and >50 eosinophils/HPF in the colon. RESULTS: Three
      hundred and sixty-one charts were reviewed and 13 EOGE cases were identified,
      including nine adults and four pediatric cases. The majority (78 %) of adult
      cases were females. Clinical presentation was variable; most patients (62 %) had 
      abdominal pain, followed by diarrhea (31 %) and nausea/vomiting (31 %). Atopy and
      food allergies were present in 54 and 38 % of patients, respectively. Weight loss
      and failure to thrive were present only in pediatric cases (50 vs 0 %; P = .01). 
      Most EOGE cases (69 %) had peripheral eosinophilia, which was more prominent in
      patients with ascites compared to patients without ascites (37.3 +/- 25.4 vs 9.3 
      +/- 5.4 %; P = .01). Among patients who had long-term follow-up; 30 % had
      spontaneous remission, 60 % responded to steroids and/or restriction diet, and 10
      % had refractory disease. CONCLUSION: EOGE is an underdiagnosed condition. In
      contrast to eosinophilic esophagitis; the disease might be female-predominant in 
      adults. High index of clinical suspicion is required for diagnosis. Further
      studies about the long-term outcomes and the efficacy of restriction diet in
      adult patients are required.

TI  - Recent Advances and Understanding of Using Probiotic-Based Interventions to
      Restore Homeostasis of the Microbiome for the Prevention/Therapy of Bacterial
      Diseases.
LID - 10.1128/microbiolspec.VMBF-0025-2015 [doi]
AB  - The importance of the microbiome in health and disease has galvanized interest in
      using manipulations of the gastrointestinal ecosystem to prevent and/or combat
      gut bacterial infections and to restore mucosal homeostasis in patients with
      generalized microbial imbalances (i.e., dysbiosis), including the human
      inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. Probiotics,
      prebiotics, or their combination use (i.e., synbiotics) are one mechanism for
      modifying the microbiota and exerting direct and indirect effects on the host
      immune responses and metabolomics profiles. These beneficial effects are
      transferred through various pathways, including the production of antimicrobial
      peptides, promoting the growth of beneficial microbes and enhancing
      immunomodulatory functions via various metabolites. While probiotic therapy has
      been used empirically for decades with mixed success, the recent advances in
      molecular and mass spectrophotometric techniques for the characterization of the 
      complexity and diversity of the intestinal microbiome has aided in better
      understanding of host-microbe interactions. It is important to better understand 
      the functional properties of the microbiome, because it is now clear that the
      microbiota secretes many metabolites that have a direct impact on host immune
      responses. This information will improve selection of the most appropriate
      probiotic strains that selectively target intestinal disease processes.

TI  - Selenium-Containing Phycocyanin from Se-Enriched Spirulina platensis Reduces
      Inflammation in Dextran Sulfate Sodium-Induced Colitis by Inhibiting NF-kappaB
      Activation.
PG  - 5060-70
LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.6b01308 [doi]
AB  - Selenium (Se) plays an important role in fine-tuning immune responses.
      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves hyperresponsive immunity of the
      digestive tract, and a low Se level might aggravate IBD progression; however, the
      beneficial effects of natural Se-enriched diets on IBD remain unknown.
      Previously, we developed high-yield Se-enriched Spirulina platensis (Se-SP) as an
      excellent organic nutritional Se source. Here we prepared Se-containing
      phycocyanin (Se-PC) from Se-SP and observed that Se-PC administration effectively
      reduced the extent of colitis in mouse induced by dextran sulfate sodium.
      Supplementation with Se-PC resulted in significant protective effects, including 
      mitigation of body weight loss, bloody diarrhea, and colonic inflammatory damage.
      The anti-inflammatory effects of Se-PC supplementation were found to involve
      modulation of cytokines, including IL-6, TNF-alpha, MCP-1, and IL-10.
      Mechanistically, Se-PC inhibited the activation of macrophages by suppressing the
      nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, which is involved in the transcription of
      these pro-inflammatory cytokines. These results together suggest potential
      benefits of Se-PC as a functional Se supplement to reduce the symptoms of IBD.

TI  - Infliximab, adalimumab and golimumab for treating moderately to severely active
      ulcerative colitis after the failure of conventional therapy (including a review 
      of TA140 and TA262): clinical effectiveness systematic review and economic model.
PG  - 1-326
LID - 10.3310/hta20390 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is the most common form of inflammatory bowel
      disease in the UK. UC can have a considerable impact on patients' quality of
      life. The burden for the NHS is substantial. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical
      effectiveness and safety of interventions, to evaluate the incremental
      cost-effectiveness of all interventions and comparators (including medical and
      surgical options), to estimate the expected net budget impact of each
      intervention, and to identify key research priorities. DATA SOURCES:
      Peer-reviewed publications, European Public Assessment Reports and manufacturers'
      submissions. The following databases were searched from inception to December
      2013 for clinical effectiveness searches and from inception to January 2014 for
      cost-effectiveness searches for published and unpublished research evidence:
      MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, The
      Cochrane Library including the Cochrane Systematic Reviews Database, Cochrane
      Controlled Trials Register, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, the
      Health Technology Assessment database and NHS Economic Evaluation Database; ISI
      Web of Science, including Science Citation Index, and the Conference Proceedings 
      Citation Index-Science and Bioscience Information Service Previews. The US Food
      and Drug Administration website and the European Medicines Agency website were
      also searched, as were research registers, conference proceedings and key
      journals. REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review [including network meta-analysis
      (NMA)] was conducted to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of named
      interventions. The health economic analysis included a review of published
      economic evaluations and the development of a de novo model. RESULTS: Ten
      randomised controlled trials were included in the systematic review. The trials
      suggest that adult patients receiving infliximab (IFX) [Remicade((R)), Merck
      Sharp & Dohme Ltd (MSD)], adalimumab (ADA) (Humira((R)), AbbVie) or golimumab
      (GOL) (Simponi((R)), MSD) were more likely to achieve clinical response and
      remission than those receiving placebo (PBO). Hospitalisation data were limited, 
      but suggested more favourable outcomes for ADA- and IFX-treated patients. Data on
      the use of surgical intervention were sparse, with a potential benefit for
      intervention-treated patients. Data were available from one trial to support the 
      use of IFX in paediatric patients. Safety issues identified included serious
      infections, malignancies and administration site reactions. Based on the NMA, in 
      the induction phase, all biological treatments were associated with statistically
      significant beneficial effects relative to PBO, with the greatest effect
      associated with IFX. For patients in response following induction, all treatments
      except ADA and GOL 100 mg at 32-52 weeks were associated with beneficial effects 
      when compared with PBO, although these were not significant. The greatest effects
      at 8-32 and 32-52 weeks were associated with 100 mg of GOL and 5 mg/kg of IFX,
      respectively. For patients in remission following induction, all treatments
      except ADA at 8-32 weeks and GOL 50 mg at 32-52 weeks were associated with
      beneficial effects when compared with PBO, although only the effect of ADA at
      32-52 weeks was significant. The greatest effects were associated with GOL (at
      8-32 weeks) and ADA (at 32-52 weeks). The economic analysis suggests that
      colectomy is expected to dominate drug therapies, but for some patients,
      colectomy may not be considered acceptable. In circumstances in which only drug
      options are considered, IFX and GOL are expected to be ruled out because of
      dominance, while the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for ADA versus
      conventional treatment is approximately pound50,300 per QALY gained. LIMITATIONS:
      The health economic model is subject to several limitations: uncertainty
      associated with extrapolating trial data over a lifetime horizon, the model does 
      not consider explicit sequential pathways of non-biological treatments, and
      evidence relating to complications of colectomy was identified through
      consideration of approaches used within previous models rather than a full
      systematic review. CONCLUSIONS: Adult patients receiving IFX, ADA or GOL were
      more likely to achieve clinical response and remission than those receiving PBO. 
      Further data are required to conclusively demonstrate the effect of interventions
      on hospitalisation and surgical outcomes. The economic analysis indicates that
      colectomy is expected to dominate medical treatments for moderate to severe UC.

TI  - (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate decreases colonic inflammation and permeability in
      a mouse model of colitis, but reduces macronutrient digestion and exacerbates
      weight loss.
PG  - 2267-2274
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201501042 [doi]
AB  - SCOPE: (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) has been reported to have putative
      health effects including the prevention of inflammation and obesity.
      Historically, polyphenols have been regarded as antinutritionals and while such
      effects may be beneficial in obese subjects, they may be deleterious in
      nutritionally compromised individuals. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined the
      effect of EGCG in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-treated mouse model of
      ulcerative colitis. Following induction of colitis, mice were treated with EGCG
      (3.2 mg/g) as the sole source of drinking fluid for 3 days. EGCG treatment
      mitigated DSS-induced colon shortening and spleen enlargement. EGCG also
      decreased colonic protein levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha, as well as colonic lipid peroxides compared to DSS-treated
      controls. We observed that EGCG reduced DSS-induced gastrointestinal
      permeability. These beneficial effects were offset by enhanced body weight loss
      in EGCG-treated mice compared to DSS-treated controls. These effects were related
      to decreased protein and lipid digestion in EGCG-treated mice compared to
      DSS-treated controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that although EGCG may
      exert anti-inflammatory effects, its ability to modulate macronutrient digestion 
      may represent a dose-limiting adverse effect that must be considered in the
      context of its use for treating inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Serum C-reactive protein in food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome versus
      food protein-induced proctocolitis in Japan.
PG  - 836-41
LID - 10.1111/ped.13036 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Some infants with food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES)
      have increased serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and fever in Japan. The aim of this
      study was therefore to clarify and compare the incidence of this in patients with
      FPIES versus patients with food protein-induced proctocolitis (FPIP). METHODS:
      One hundred and sixteen infants with non-IgE-mediated gastrointestinal food
      allergies were enrolled in this study and classified into three phenotypes: FPIES
      presenting with vomiting and/or diarrhea (n = 47); FPIP with bloody stool alone
      (n =19); and the mixed phenotype (MP), bloody stool with vomiting and/or diarrhea
      (n = 50). RESULTS: Serum CRP was increased in 55.3% of the FPIES group, similar
      to that in the MP group (54.0%), and significantly higher than in the FPIP group 
      (15.8%; P < 0.01). Fever was observed in 29.8% of the FPIES group, significantly 
      higher than in the MP group (8.0%; P < 0.01) and in the FPIP group (0%; P <
      0.05). Patients with fever had significantly higher serum CRP than patients
      without fever (median, 12.8 vs <0.2 mg/dL, P < 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: Serum CRP
      was significantly higher in the FPIES group than in the FPIP group. This suggests
      that serum CRP is a useful marker for differentiating the pathogenesis of FPIES
      from FPIP. From the perspective of serum CRP, the pathology of the intestinal
      inflammation in MP subjects is suggested to be similar to that of FPIES.

TI  - Is There a Role for the Enteral Administration of Serum-Derived Immunoglobulins
      in Human Gastrointestinal Disease and Pediatric Critical Care Nutrition?
PG  - 535-43
LID - 10.3945/an.115.011924 [doi]
AB  - Twenty years ago, there was profound, international interest in developing oral
      human, bovine, or chicken egg-derived immunoglobulin (Ig) for the prevention and 
      nutritional treatment of childhood malnutrition and gastrointestinal disease,
      including acute diarrhea and necrotizing enterocolitis. Although such Ig products
      were shown to be effective, with both nutritional and antidiarrheal benefits,
      interest waned because of their cost and because of the perceived risk of bovine 
      serum encephalitis (BSE). BSE is no longer considered a barrier to use of oral
      Ig, because the WHO has declared the United States to be BSE-free since the early
      2000s. Low-cost bovine-derived products with high Ig content have been developed 
      and are regulated as medical foods. These new products, called serum bovine Igs
      (SBIs), facilitate the management of chronic or severe gastrointestinal
      disturbances in both children and adults and are regulated by the US Food and
      Drug Administration. Well-established applications for use of SBIs include human 
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated enteropathy and diarrhea-predominant
      irritable bowel syndrome. However, SBIs and other similar products could
      potentially become important components of the treatment regimen for other
      conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, by aiding in disease control
      without immunosuppressive side effects. In addition, SBIs may be helpful in
      conditions associated with the depletion of circulating and luminal Igs and could
      potentially play an important role in critical care nutrition. The rationale for 
      their use is to facilitate intraluminal microbial antibody coating, an essential 
      process in immune recognition in the gut which is disturbed in these conditions, 
      thereby leading to intestinal inflammation. Thus, oral Ig may emerge as an
      important "add-on" therapy for a variety of gastrointestinal and nutritional
      problems during the next decade.

AB  - Over the past 20 years, a growing amount of evidence supports the role of
      microbes and an imbalanced microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). While 
      many reviews have been written on the microbiota in IBD, few have considered how 
      they fulfil the Koch's postulates. In this review, we consider how the Koch's
      postulates might be modified so that they can be fulfilled for polymicrobial
      diseases, and we discuss the progress made to date in fulfilling them.

TI  - delta- and gamma-tocopherols inhibit phIP/DSS-induced colon carcinogenesis by
      protection against early cellular and DNA damages.
PG  - 172-183
LID - 10.1002/mc.22481 [doi]
AB  - Tocopherols, the major forms of vitamin E, are a family of fat-soluble compounds 
      that exist in alpha (alpha-T), beta (beta-T), gamma (gamma-T), and delta
      (delta-T) variants. A cancer preventive effect of vitamin E is suggested by
      epidemiological studies. However, past animal studies and human intervention
      trials with alpha-T, the most active vitamin E form, have yielded disappointing
      results. A possible explanation is that the cancer preventive activity of alpha-T
      is weak compared to other tocopherol forms. In the present study, we investigated
      the effects of delta-T, gamma-T, and alpha-T (0.2% in diet) in a novel colon
      cancer model induced by the meat-derived dietary carcinogen,
      2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and promoted by dextran
      sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in CYP1A-humanized (hCYP1A) mice. PhIP/DSS
      treatments induced multiple polypoid tumors, mainly tubular adenocarcinomas, in
      the middle to distal colon of the hCYP1A mice after 10 wk. Dietary
      supplementation with delta-T and gamma-T significantly reduced colon tumor
      formation and suppressed markers of oxidative and nitrosative stress (i.e.,
      8-oxo-dG and nitrotyrosine) as well as pro-inflammatory mediators (i.e.,
      NF-kappaB p65 and p-STAT3) in tumors and adjacent tissues. By administering
      delta-T at different time periods, we obtained results suggesting that the
      inhibitory effect of delta-T against colon carcinogenesis is mainly due to
      protection against early cellular and DNA damages caused by PhIP. alpha-T was
      found to be ineffective in inhibiting colon tumors and less effective in
      attenuating the molecular changes. Altogether, we demonstrated strong cancer
      preventive effects of delta-T and gamma-T in a physiologically relevant model of 
      human colon cancer. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Specific immunotherapy plus Clostridium butyricum alleviates ulcerative colitis
      in patients with food allergy.
PG  - 25587

AB  - The aberrant T cell activation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of
      intestinal inflammation, such as ulcerative colitis (UC). C. butyricum (Cb) is a 
      probiotic and has been employed in the treatment of immune diseases. This study
      tests a hypothesis that specific immunotherapy (SIT) plus oral Cb (an
      over-the-counter probiotic) alleviates the UC symptoms. In this study, we
      conducted a randomized, double-blind, clinical study at our hospital. A total of 
      80 patients with relapsing-remitting ulcerative colitis and high levels of
      specific IgE antibody was randomly divided into 4 groups, and were treated with
      SIT or/and Cb, or placebo, respectively for 1 year. The results showed that a
      food antigen-specific Th2 polarization immune response was observed in UC
      patients with food allergy (FA). The frequency of regulatory B cells was
      significantly less in UC patients with FA as compared with healthy subjects. The 
      UC patients with FA were treated with SIT and Cb showed significant amelioration 
      of UC clinical symptoms, reduction of using UC-control medicines, and suppression
      of the skewed Th2 polarization, which did not occur in those treated with either 
      SIT alone, or Cb alone, or placebo. In conclusion, combination of SIT and Cb
      efficiently alleviates a fraction of UC patients.

TI  - Adenine Inhibits TNF-alpha Signaling in Intestinal Epithelial Cells and Reduces
      Mucosal Inflammation in a Dextran Sodium Sulfate-Induced Colitis Mouse Model.
PG  - 4227-34
LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.6b00665 [doi]
AB  - Adenine (6-amino-6H-purine), found in molokheiya (Corchorus olitorius L.), has
      exerted vasorelaxation effects in the thoracic aorta. However, the mode of action
      of the anti-inflammatory effect of adenine is unclear. Thus, we investigated to
      clarify the effect of adenine on chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal
      tract. In intestinal epithelial cells, adenine significantly inhibited tumor
      necrosis factor-alpha-induced interleukin-8 secretion. The inhibition of adenine 
      was abolished under the treatment of inhibitors of adenyl cyclase (AC) and
      protein kinase A (PKA), indicating the effect of adenine was mediated through the
      AC/PKA pathway. Adenine (5, 10, and 50 mg/kg BW/day) was administered orally for 
      14 days to female BALB/c mice, and then 5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) was given
      to induce colitis. Adenine (5 mg/kg BW/day) significantly prevented DSS-induced
      colon shortening, expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and histological
      damage in the colon. These results suggest that adenine can be a promising
      nutraceutical for the prevention of intestinal inflammation.

AB  - A 37-year-old woman with a history of type II diabetes and Crohn's disease,
      status postcholecystectomy, presented with a >2-week history of cramping
      abdominal pain, nausea, non-bloody/non-bilious emesis and, later, diarrhoea. A
      flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed, revealing that 'a segmental pseudomembrane 
      was found from rectum to sigmoid colon'. Clostridium difficile PCR on the stool
      was repeated twice and resulted negative both times. A food history prior to
      onset of symptoms was consistent with Staphylococcal food poisoning and a stool
      culture was positive for heavy growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
      aureus and the absence of enteric flora. The patient was successfully treated
      with oral vancomycin.

TI  - Auto-brewery Syndrome in the Setting of Long-standing Crohn's Disease: A Case
      Report and Review of the Literature.
PG  - 1448-1450
AB  - CLINICAL BACKGROUND: A 71-year-old male with 50-year history of Crohn's disease
      was evaluated for acute onset of dizziness and slurred speech. Blood ethanol
      levels were elevated despite abstinence from alcohol for over 30 years. CT
      enterography demonstrated massive dilation of the small bowel with anastomotic
      stricture. DISCUSSION: Auto-brewery syndrome may be considered in a patient with 
      chronic obstruction or hypomotility presenting with elevated serum ethanol levels
      in the setting of high carbohydrate intake. Although treatment algorithms lack
      validation, judicious use of antibiotic therapy, carbohydrate control, and short 
      courses of antifungal therapy have all been reported in the literature.
      Importantly, clinical consideration of 'auto-brewery' should be undertaken with
      substantial caution, given the lack of validated mechanisms linking endogenous
      ethanol production to peripheral blood ethanol.

AB  - Diverticular disease is a common condition that is associated with variable
      presentations. For this review article, we performed a review of articles in
      PubMed through February 1, 2016, by using the following MeSH terms: colon
      diverticula, colonic diverticulitis, colonic diverticulosis, colonic
      diverticulum, colonic diverticula, and diverticula. Diverticula are structural
      alterations within the colonic wall that classically form "pockets" referred to
      as diverticula. Diverticula form from herniation of the colonic mucosa and
      submucosa through defects in the circular muscle layers within the colonic wall. 
      Often this is at the sites of penetrating blood vessels in the colon.
      Diverticular disease is extremely common, which resulted in 2,682,168 outpatient 
      visits and 283,355 hospitalization discharges for diverticulitis or
      diverticulosis in 2009. Diverticulosis is one of the most common detected
      conditions found incidentally on colonoscopy. Risk factors for the development of
      diverticulitis include obesity, smoking, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
      corticosteroids, and opiates. In contrast, fiber may be protective, but recent
      studies have questioned the role of fiber in developing diverticular disease.
      Most patients with diverticulosis will be asymptomatic, but a subset of patients 
      may develop nonspecific abdominal pain (isolated or recurrent), diverticulitis,
      or segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis. Classically, the treatment
      of diverticulitis has included antibiotics for all patients. More recent evidence
      indicates that in mild to even moderate uncomplicated diverticulitis, antibiotics
      may not be as necessary as initially believed. In more complicated
      diverticulitis, intravenous antibiotics and surgery may be necessary. Once a
      patient has had an attack of diverticulitis, increasing fiber may help prevent
      future attacks. Other modalities such as 5-aminosalicylate products, antibiotics,
      and probiotics are still of unclear benefit in preventing future episodes of
      diverticulitis. Similarly, even when patients develop recurrent episodes of
      diverticulitis, surgery may not be necessary as a prophylactic treatment.

TI  - Effect of probiotics (Lactobacillus plantarum 299 plus Bifidobacterium Cure21) in
      patients with poor ileal pouch function: a randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 1087-92
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2016.1161067 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Poor pouch function after restorative proctocolectomy for ulcerative
      colitis is a considerable problem. Pouchitis and functional disorders are the
      most common reasons. Probiotics seem to have a beneficial effect in pouchitis but
      have not been assessed in functional pouch disorders. The aim was to analyse the 
      effects of probiotics in patients with poor pouch function. METHODS: Thirty-three
      patients were randomized to probiotics (Lactobacillus plantarum 299 and
      Bifidobacterium infantis Cure 21) or placebo in a double blinded, 1:1 fashion.
      The treatment effect was assessed by the pouch functional score (PFS; 0-15, 15
      worst), pouchitis disease activity index (PDAI; 0-18, 18 worst), and levels of
      four faecal biomarkers of inflammation (calprotectin, lactoferrin,
      myeloperoxidase [MPO] and eosinophilic cationic protein [ECP]). RESULTS:
      Thirty-two patients were included (probiotics = 17, placebo = 16). There was no
      difference in change in the PFS from before to after treatment between the groups
      (median difference: -1.00, 95% C.I. -3.00 to 0.00, p = 0.119). Furthermore,
      probiotics had no effect on PDAI (median difference: 0.00, 95% C.I. 0.00-1.00, p 
      = 0.786), or on faecal biomarkers. Significant correlations were observed between
      PDAI and each of the faecal biomarkers at study start. There were no correlations
      between PFS or PDAI symptom subscore and the biomarkers. PDAI endoscopic and
      histologic subscores correlated significantly to each of the biomarkers.
      CONCLUSION: The hypothesis that probiotics improves pouch-related dysfunction was
      not confirmed. Faecal biomarkers could play a future role in the management of
      pouch patients.

TI  - Dairy Products, Dietary Calcium, and Risk of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Results 
      From a European Prospective Cohort Investigation.
PG  - 1403-11
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000798 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dairy products may be involved in the etiology of inflammatory bowel 
      disease by modulating gut microbiota and immune responses, but data from
      epidemiological studies examining this relationship are limited. We investigated 
      the association between prediagnostic intake of these foods and dietary calcium, 
      and the subsequent development of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis
      (UC). METHODS: In total, 401,326 participants were enrolled in the European
      Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort. At recruitment,
      consumption of total and specific dairy products (milk, yogurt, and cheese) and
      dietary calcium was measured using validated food frequency questionnaires. Cases
      developing incident CD (n = 110) or UC (n = 244) during follow-up were matched
      with 4 controls. Conditional logistic regression analyses were used to calculate 
      odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for total energy 
      intake and smoking. RESULTS: Compared with the lowest quartile, the ORs for the
      highest quartile of total dairy products and dietary calcium intake were 0.61
      (95% CI, 0.32-1.19, p trend = 0.19) and 0.63 (95% CI, 0.28-1.42, p trend = 0.23) 
      for CD, and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.50-1.30, p trend = 0.40) and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.49-1.34,
      p trend = 0.60) for UC, respectively. Compared with nonconsumers, individuals
      consuming milk had significantly reduced odds of CD (OR 0.30, 95% CI, 0.13-0.65) 
      and nonsignificantly reduced odds of UC (OR 0.85, 95% CI, 0.49-1.47).
      CONCLUSIONS: Milk consumption may be associated with a decreased risk of
      developing CD, although a clear dose-response relationship was not established.
      Further studies are warranted to confirm this possible protective effect.

AB  - Survey aims were to investigate the dietary concerns, beliefs and opinions of
      people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and differences between those with 
      Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). A cross-sectional postal
      questionnaire was sent to people with IBD who were booked into an adult IBD or
      Gastroenterology clinic over a 6-week period. There were 416 eligible people and 
      168 (40%) responded. Sixty-four (42%) people indicated that food affects their
      symptoms a lot or severely. Eighty (51%) respondents indicated that diet was
      important or extremely important in controlling symptoms. Significantly more
      people with CD reported meat, fatty foods, chocolate and salad as a trigger than 
      people with UC. Significantly more people with UC reported wheat as a trigger.
      More people with CD avoided meat and chocolate than UC. This survey highlights
      the importance of nutrition and diet to people with IBD. Frequent food avoidance 
      was reported. This may impact on nutrition-related health problems.

TI  - DNA damage and apoptosis in blood neutrophils of inflammatory bowel disease
      patients and in Caco-2 cells in vitro exposed to betanin.
PG  - 265-71
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic, relapsing, inflammatory disorders 
      of the gastrointestinal tract, and continuing colonic inflammation is considered 
      an important risk factor in the development of colorectal cancer. Our previous
      studies showed that beetroot (Beta vulgaris var. rubra) products and their major 
      component betanin modulate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and DNA
      damage in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) stimulated human
      polymorphonuclear neutrophils of healthy volunteers. The aim of the present study
      was to evaluate the effects of betanin on the oxidative DNA damage and apoptosis 
      in neutrophils isolated from blood of patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease--ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The results were
      compared with those obtained in colon carcinoma-derived Caco-2 cells. Betanin
      treatment at the concentration of 100 muM for 24 h increased DNA damage assessed 
      by comet assay in IBD patients' neutrophils. A similar effect although less
      pronounced was observed in Caco-2 cells. Treatment of Caco-2 cells with H2O2
      caused a 4-fold increase of DNA strand breaks in comparison to untreated cells,
      but pre-treatment with betanin reduced DNA damage in these cells. Betanin also
      induced procaspase-3 cleavage and caspase-3 activity accompanied by the loss of
      mitochondrial transmembrane potential, indicating its pro-apoptotic activity.
      These results suggest that betanin may support mechanisms that lead to the
      release of ROS and apoptotic cell death. In this way betanin may exert
      anti-inflammatory and potentially cancer preventive activity.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of inflammatory disorders of the
      intestine caused by dysregulated T-cell mediated immune response against
      commensal microflora. Probiotics are reported as therapeutically effective
      against IBD. However, variable efficacy of the live probiotic strains, difference
      in survival and persistence in the gut between the strains and the lack of
      insight into the mechanisms of probiotic action limit optimal therapeutic
      efficacy. Our aims were to evaluate the lactobacillus strains isolated from the
      North Indian population for the generation of regulatory cells and cytokines in
      the intestine, to study their effects on pro-inflammatory mediators in the mouse 
      model of inflammatory bowel disease and to explore the underlying mechanisms of
      their actions. Among the selected lactobacillus strains, Lactobacillus casei Lbs2
      (MTCC5953) significantly suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced pro-inflammatory
      cytokine (TNF-alpha, IL-6) secretion. Both live and heat-killed Lbs2 polarized
      Th0 cells to T-regulatory (Treg) cells in vitro, increased the frequency of
      FoxP3(+) Treg cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) and alleviated
      macroscopic and histopathological features of colitis in probiotic-fed mice.
      Moreover, the levels of IL-12, TNF-alpha and IL-17A were suppressed, while IL-10 
      and TGF-beta levels were augmented in the colonic tissues of Lbs2-treated mice.
      The induced Treg (iTreg) cells secreted IL-10 and TGF-beta and exerted
      suppressive effects on the proliferation of effector T-cells. Adoptive transfer
      of iTreg cells ameliorated the disease manifestations of murine colitis and
      suppressed the levels of TNF-alpha and IL-17A. Finally, Lbs2 effects were
      mediated by Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) activation on the dendritic cells. This
      study identified live and heat-killed Lbs2 as putative therapeutic candidates
      against IBD and highlighted their Toll-like receptor 2-dependent immunomodulatory
      and regulatory function.

PG  - 117-127
LID - 10.1038/mi.2016.43 [doi]
AB  - Development of the intestinal microbiota during early life serves as a key
      regulatory stage in establishing the host-microbial relationship. This symbiotic 
      relationship contributes to developing host immunity and maintaining health
      throughout the life span. This study was to develop an approach to colonize
      conventionally raised mice with a model probiotic bacterium, Lactobacillus
      rhamnosus GG (LGG), and to determine the effects of LGG colonization on
      intestinal development and prevention of colitis in adulthood. LGG colonization
      in conventionally raised was established by administering LGG to pregnant mice
      starting at gestational day 18 and pups at postnatal days 1- 5. LGG colonization 
      promoted bodyweight gain and increased diversity and richness of the colonic
      mucosa-associated microbiota before weaning. Intestinal epithelial cell
      proliferation, differentiation, tight junction formation, and mucosal IgA
      production were all significantly enhanced in LGG-colonized mice. Adult mice
      colonized with LGG showed increased IgA production and decreased susceptibility
      to intestinal injury and inflammation induced in the dextran sodium sulfate model
      of colitis. Thus, neonatal colonization of mice with LGG enhances intestinal
      functional maturation and IgA production and confers lifelong health consequences
      on protection from intestinal injury and inflammation. This strategy might be
      applied for benefiting health in the host.

TI  - Casein glycomacropeptide for active distal ulcerative colitis: a randomized pilot
      study.
PG  - 555-63
LID - 10.1111/eci.12634 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In ulcerative colitis (UC), dietary supplements may have
      anti-inflammatory properties and improve disease course. We investigated the
      effects of casein glycomacropeptide (CGMP), a fraction of bovine whey protein, in
      active UC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a randomized open-label intervention study, 
      24 patients with active UC involving 10-40 cm of the distal colon were randomized
      in a 2 : 1 ratio into two groups. The first group was administered their usual
      treatment plus a daily supplement of CGMP 30 g, and the second group was
      administered a dose escalation to 4800 mg oral mesalamine daily (standard
      treatment) for 4 weeks. Clinical, endoscopic, mucosal and circulating disease
      activity markers were monitored. Acceptance of and adherence to CGMP up to 8
      weeks were documented. RESULTS: After 4 weeks of treatment, 10 of 16 (63%)
      patients who received CGMP had an unchanged or decreased Simple Clinical Colitis 
      Activity Index (SCCAI), which was similar to the four of eight (50%) (P = 0.67)
      patients on the standard treatment. The number of patients in which SCCAI
      decreased by three or more did not differ between the two groups: nine of 16
      (56%) in the CGMP group vs. four of eight (50%) in the standard treatment group
      (P = 0.77). Changes in disease extent and severity were similar between the two
      groups. CGMP was well tolerated and accepted by the patients. CONCLUSIONS: The
      addition of CGMP as a nutritional therapy to standard treatment was safe and
      accepted by patients with active distal UC. The disease-modifying effect of CGMP 
      was similar to that of the mesalamine dose escalation.

TI  - Flavonoids in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Review.
PG  - 211
LID - 10.3390/nu8040211 [doi]
LID - E211 [pii]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by chronic inflammation of the 
      intestine that compromises the patients' life quality and requires sustained
      pharmacological and surgical treatments. Since their etiology is not completely
      understood, non-fully-efficient drugs have been developed and those that have
      shown effectiveness are not devoid of quite important adverse effects that impair
      their long-term use. In this regard, a growing body of evidence confirms the
      health benefits of flavonoids. Flavonoids are compounds with low molecular weight
      that are widely distributed throughout the vegetable kingdom, including in edible
      plants. They may be of great utility in conditions of acute or chronic intestinal
      inflammation through different mechanisms including protection against oxidative 
      stress, and preservation of epithelial barrier function and immunomodulatory
      properties in the gut. In this review we have revised the main flavonoid classes 
      that have been assessed in different experimental models of colitis as well as
      the proposed mechanisms that support their beneficial effects.

TI  - Dietary Lipid Type, Rather Than Total Number of Calories, Alters Outcomes of
      Enteric Infection in Mice.
PG  - 1846-56
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiw084 [doi]
AB  - Dietary lipids modulate immunity, yet the means by which specific fatty acids
      affect infectious disease susceptibility remains unclear. Deciphering
      lipid-induced immunity is critical to understanding the balance required for
      protecting against pathogens while avoiding chronic inflammatory diseases. To
      understand how specific lipids alter susceptibility to enteric infection, we fed 
      mice isocaloric, high-fat diets composed of corn oil (rich in n-6 polyunsaturated
      fatty acids [n-6 PUFAs]), olive oil (rich in monounsaturated fatty acids), or
      milk fat (rich in saturated fatty acids) with or without fish oil (rich in n-3
      PUFAs). After 5 weeks of dietary intervention, mice were challenged with
      Citrobacter rodentium, and pathological responses were assessed. Olive oil diets 
      resulted in little colonic pathology associated with intestinal alkaline
      phosphatase, a mucosal defense factor that detoxifies lipopolysaccharide. In
      contrast, while both corn oil and milk fat diets resulted in inflammation-induced
      colonic damage, only milk fat induced compensatory protective responses,
      including short chain fatty acid production. Fish oil combined with milk fat,
      unlike unsaturated lipid diets, had a protective effect associated with
      intestinal alkaline phosphatase activity. Overall, these results reveal that
      dietary lipid type, independent of the total number of calories associated with
      the dietary lipid, influences the susceptibility to enteric damage and the
      benefits of fish oil during infection.

TI  - Mango polyphenolics reduce inflammation in intestinal colitis-involvement of the 
      miR-126/PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis in vitro and in vivo.
PG  - 197-207
LID - 10.1002/mc.22484 [doi]
AB  - This study sought to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory
      effect of mango (Mangifera Indica L.) polyphenolics containing gallic acid and
      gallotanins, and the role of the miR-126/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling axis in vitro
      and in vivo. Polyphenolics extracted from mango (var. Keitt) were investigated in
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated CCD-18Co cells. Rats received either a beverage 
      with mango polyphenolics or a control beverage, and were exposed to three cycles 
      of 3% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) followed by a 2-wk recovery period. The mango 
      extract (10 mg GAE/L) suppressed the protein expression of NF-kappaB,
      p-NF-kappaB, PI3K (p85beta), HIF-1alpha, p70S6K1, and RPS6 in LPS-treated
      CCD-18Co cells. LPS reduced miR-126 expression, whereas, the mango extract
      induced miR-126 expression in a dose-dependent manner. The relationship between
      miR-126 and its target, PI3K (p85beta), was confirmed by treating cells with
      miR-126 antagomiR where mango polyphenols reversed the effects of the antagomiR. 
      In vivo, mango beverage protected against DSS-induced colonic inflammation (47%, 
      P = 0.05) and decreased the Ki-67 labeling index in the central and basal regions
      compared to the control. Mango beverage significantly attenuated the expression
      of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and iNOS at the mRNA
      and protein level. Moreover, the expression of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR was reduced,
      whereas, miR-126 was upregulated by the mango treatment. These results suggest
      that mango polyphenols attenuated inflammatory response by modulating the
      PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway at least in part through upregulation of miRNA-126
      expression both in vitro and in vivo; thus, mango polyphenolics might be relevant
      as preventive agents in ulcerative colitis. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

PG  - 129-33
LID - 10.1007/s12328-016-0645-8 [doi]
AB  - Patients with inflammatory bowel disease often have extraintestinal
      manifestations (EIMs) involving almost all organ systems, but little has been
      reported on Achilles tendinitis. Herein, we present a unique case of Achilles
      tendinitis, which manifested shortly after initiation of mesalazine therapy for
      ulcerative colitis. A 26-year-old Japanese woman with bloody diarrhea and
      abdominal cramps lasting for 7 days was referred to our hospital. The Lichtiger
      clinical activity index (CAI) score was 9 at the first visit. Based on the
      clinical symptoms and examination results, she was diagnosed with ulcerative
      pancolitis in the active phase, and treatment with mesalazine (2.4 g/day) and
      probiotics was initiated. Her symptoms resolved within 7 days of treatment (CAI
      3). However, she then developed bilateral Achilles tendinitis without any
      apparent cause. The Achilles tendinitis subsided with conservative management
      within 2 weeks, despite continuation of mesalazine therapy. This case
      instructively suggests that Achilles tendinitis should be noted as an EIM of
      ulcerative colitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Barwon area in Australia has one of the highest incidence rates
      of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and therefore is an ideal location to study
      the impact of environmental exposures on the disease's development. AIM: To study
      these exposures prior to the development of IBD in a population-based cohort.
      METHOD: One hundred and thirty-two incident cases (81 Crohn disease (CD) and 51
      ulcerative colitis (UC)) from an IBD registry and 104 controls replied to the
      International Organization of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases environmental
      questionnaire. This included 87 questions about pre-illness exposures that
      included childhood illnesses, vaccinations, breastfeeding, house amenities, pets 
      and swimming, diet and smoking. RESULTS: The factors associated with CD included 
      smoking (odds ratio (OR): 1.42, confidence interval (CI): 1-2.02, P = 0.029);
      childhood events, including tonsillectomy (OR: 1.74, CI: 1.15-2.6, P = 0.003) and
      chicken pox infection (OR: 3.89, CI: 1.61-9.4, P = 0.005) and pre-diagnosis
      intake of frequent fast food (OR: 2.26, CI: 1.76-4.33, P = 0.003). In UC, the
      risk factors included smoking (OR: 1.39, CI: 1.1-1.92, P = 0.026) and
      pre-diagnosis intake of frequent fast food (OR: 2.91, CI: 1.54-5.58, P < 0.001), 
      and high caffeine intake was protective (OR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.3-0.87, P = 0.002). 
      Other protective exposures for UC included high fruit intake (OR: 0.59, CI:
      0.4-0.88, P = 0.003) and having pets as a child (OR: 0.36, CI: 0.2-0.79, P =
      0.001). CONCLUSION: This first Australian population-based study of environmental
      risk factors confirms that smoking, childhood immunological events and dietary
      factors play a role in IBD development; while high caffeine intake and pet
      ownership offer a protective effect.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease confers an increased risk of developing
      colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC). During the active colitis or developing
      tumor stage, commensal bacteria show dynamic translocation. However, whether
      alteration of the bacterial composition in the gut causes CAC is still unclear.
      To clarify the effect of commensal bacteria on CAC development, we employed an
      azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced murine CAC model
      treated with or without antibiotics. In addition, we analyzed the effects of
      antibiotics on infiltration of myeloid cells, colonic inflammatory responses, and
      colorectal cancer formation. We found that vancomycin treatment dramatically
      suppressed tumor development. In addition, AOM/DSS treatment greatly induced the 
      infiltration of Gr-1(high)/CD11b(high) neutrophils to the colon, which led to the
      production of tumor necrosis factor alpha and inducible nitric oxide synthase.
      Vancomycin treatment suppressed the infiltration of neutrophils induced by
      AOM/DSS. Moreover, vancomycin treatment greatly reduced the colon injury and DNA 
      damage caused by AOM/DSS-induced NO radicals. Our results indicate that
      vancomycin-sensitive bacteria induced colon inflammation and DNA damage by
      attracting neutrophils into damaged colon tissue, thus promoting tumor formation.

AB  - Clostridium difficile is an anaerobic, gram positive, sporulating,
      toxin-producing bacillus which causes a spectrum of clinical disease ranging from
      an asymptomatic carrier state to toxic megacolon and fulminant disease. Infection
      with C. difficile is an expensive and pervasive health care burden. The current
      theory regarding the development of C. difficile infection (CDI) suggests that
      disruption of the structure and/or function of an individual's normal intestinal 
      microbiota enables colonization by C. difficile, and in the absence of an
      effective immune response, the bacteria causes illness. In this article we
      discuss the role of the colonic microbiota in the development of CDI and the
      potential role of probiotics in preventing and treating CDI. We review the
      evidence from in vitro laboratory and pre-clinical studies, as well as evidence
      from clinical studies and discuss the current recommendations for the use of
      probiotics for CDI in clinical practice.

AB  - Therapeutic manipulation of gut microbiota has proven valuable in the management 
      of ulcerative colitis and pouchitis. Despite some similarities among the various 
      inflammatory bowel conditions, the probiotics investigated thus far seem to
      confer little benefit in Crohn's disease. In this review, we aim to bring
      together the evidence available on the clinical effect of probiotics and
      prebioltics in Crohn's disease patients, and to clarify the place of probiotic
      treatment in current Crohn's therapeutic regimens.

AB  - The intestinal microbiota is one of the key players in the etiology of ulcerative
      colitis. Manipulation of this microflora with probiotics and prebiotics is an
      attractive strategy in the management of ulcerative colitis. Several intervention
      studies for both the induction and maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis
      patients have been performed. Most of these studies evaluated VSL#3 or E. Coli
      Nissle 1917 and in general there is evidence for efficacy of these agents for
      induction and maintenance of remission. However, studies are frequently
      underpowered, lack a control group, and are very heterogeneous investigating
      different probiotic strains in different study populations. The absence of
      well-powered robust randomized placebo-controlled trials impedes the widespread
      use of probiotics and prebiotics in ulcerative colitis. However, given the
      promising results that are currently available, probiotics and prebiotics may
      find their way to the treatment algorithm for ulcerative colitis in the near
      future.

AB  - The role of the intestinal microbiota in human health is gaining more attention
      since clear changes in the composition of the intestinal bacteria or environment 
      are seen in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, allergy, autoimmune
      disease, and some lifestyle-related illnesses. A healthy gut environment is
      regulated by the exquisite balance of intestinal microbiota, metabolites, and the
      host's immune system. Imbalance of these factors in genetically susceptible
      persons may promote a disease state. Manipulation of the intestinal microbiota
      with prebiotics, which can selectively stimulate growth of beneficial bacteria,
      might help to maintain a healthy intestinal environment or improve diseased one. 
      In this review, analytical methods for identification of intestinal bacteria and 
      an update on the correlation of the intestinal microbiota with human health and
      disease were discussed by introducing our recent studies to determine the
      prebiotic effects of a fiber-rich food in animal model and on healthy people and 
      patients with ulcerative colitis (UC).

PG  - 3104727
LID - 10.1155/2016/3104727 [doi]
AB  - Dendritic cells present in the digestive tract are constantly exposed to
      environmental antigens, commensal flora, and invading pathogens. Under
      steady-state conditions, these cells have high tolerogenic potential, triggering 
      differentiation of regulatory T cells to protect the host from unwanted
      proinflammatory immune responses to innocuous antigens or commensals. On the
      other hand, these cells must discriminate between commensal flora and invading
      pathogens and mount powerful immune response against pathogens. A potential
      result of unbalanced tolerogenic versus proinflammatory responses mediated by
      dendritic cells is associated with chronic inflammatory conditions, such as
      Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, food allergies, and celiac disease. Herein, 
      we review the dendritic cell population involved in mediating tolerance and
      immunity in mucosal surfaces, the progress in unveiling their development in
      vivo, and factors that can influence their functions.

      Study from Iran.
PG  - 404-9
LID - 10.1080/01635581.2016.1152385 [doi]
AB  - Diet and inflammation have been suggested to be important risk factors for
      ulcerative colitis (UC). In this case-control study conducted in Iran, we
      examined the ability of the dietary inflammatory index (DII) to predict UC. This 
      study included 62 UC cases and 124 controls hospitalized for acute non-neoplastic
      diseases. The DII was computed based on dietary intake assessed by a previously
      validated food frequency questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regression models 
      were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and the DII was analyzed as both
      continuous and as tertiles. Energy was adjusted using the residual method.
      Subjects with higher DII scores (i.e., with a more pro-inflammatory diet) had a
      higher risk of UC, with the DII being used as both a continuous variable
      (OR(continuous) 1.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-2.32; one unit increase
      corresponding to approximately 8% of its range in the current study) and as
      tertiles (OR(tertile3vstertile1) 2.58, 95% CI 1.03-6.48, P(trend)| = |0.04).
      These results indicate that a pro-inflammatory diet is associated with increased 
      risk of UC.

TI  - Comparison of anti-inflammatory mechanisms of mango (Mangifera Indica L.) and
      pomegranate (Punica Granatum L.) in a preclinical model of colitis.
PG  - 1912-23
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201501008 [doi]
AB  - SCOPE: Tannin-rich fruits have been evaluated as alternative prevention
      strategies for colorectal cancer based on their anti-inflammatory properties.
      This study compared tannin-rich preparations from mango (rich in gallotannins)
      and pomegranate (rich in ellagitannins) in the dextran sodium sulfate-induced
      colitis model. METHODS AND RESULTS: In rats, mango and pomegranate beverages
      decreased intestinal inflammation and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in
      mucosa and serum. The mango beverage suppressed the ratio of phosphorylated/total
      protein expression of the IGF-1R-AKT/mTOR axis and downregulated mRNA expression 
      of Igf1, Insr, and pik3cv. Pomegranate decreased p70S6K and RPS6, as well as
      Rps6ka2, Map2k2, and Mapk1 mRNA. In silico modeling indicated a high binding of
      docked of gallic acid to the catalytic domain of IGF-1R, which may suppress the
      activity of the enzyme. Ellagic acid docked effectively into the catalytic
      domains of both IGF-1R and EGFR. In vitro assays with lipopolysaccharide-treated 
      CCD-18Co cells using polyphenolic extracts from each beverage, as well as pure
      compounds, corroborated the predictions made in silico. CONCLUSION: Mango
      polyphenols inhibited the IGF-1R- AKT/mTOR axis, and pomegranate polyphenols
      downregulate the mTOR downstream pathway through reductions in ERK1/2. These
      results suggest that extracts rich in gallo- and ellagitannins act on different
      molecular targets in the protection against ulcerative colitis.

TI  - FDA Approval Summary: Pembrolizumab for the Treatment of Patients With Metastatic
      Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Whose Tumors Express Programmed Death-Ligand 1.
PG  - 643-50
LID - 10.1634/theoncologist.2015-0498 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: : On October 2, 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      granted accelerated approval for pembrolizumab, a breakthrough therapy-designated
      drug, for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) whose tumors express programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), as determined by 
      an FDA-approved test, and who have disease progression on or after
      platinum-containing chemotherapy or targeted therapy against anaplastic lymphoma 
      kinase or epidermal growth factor receptor, if appropriate. This indication was
      approved concurrently with the PD-L1 immunohistochemistry 22C3 pharmDx, a
      companion diagnostic test for patient selection based on PD-L1 tumor expression. 
      The accelerated approval was granted based on durable objective response rate
      (ORR) and an acceptable toxicity profile demonstrated in a multicenter,
      open-label trial enrolling 550 patients with metastatic NSCLC. The efficacy
      population comprised 61 patients with tumors identified as strongly positive for 
      PD-L1, and the confirmed ORR as determined by blinded independent central review 
      was 41% (95% confidence interval: 28.6%, 54.3%); all were partial responses. At
      the time of the analysis, responses were ongoing in 21 of 25 patients (84%), with
      11 patients (44%) having response duration of >/=6 months. The most commonly
      occurring (>/=20%) adverse reactions included fatigue, decreased appetite,
      dyspnea, and cough. The most frequent (>/=2%) serious adverse drug reactions were
      pleural effusion, pneumonia, dyspnea, pulmonary embolism, and pneumonitis.
      Immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in 13% of patients and included
      pneumonitis, colitis, hypophysitis, and thyroid disorders. The accelerated
      approval regulations describe approval of drugs and biologic products for serious
      and life-threatening illnesses based on a surrogate endpoint likely to predict
      clinical benefit. Under these regulations, a confirmatory trial or trials is
      required to verify and describe the benefit of pembrolizumab for patients with
      metastatic NSCLC. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This report presents key information
      on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accelerated approval of
      pembrolizumab for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung
      cancer whose tumors express programmed death-ligand 1, as determined by an
      FDA-approved test, and who have disease progression on or after
      platinum-containing chemotherapy or targeted therapy against anaplastic lymphoma 
      kinase or epidermal growth factor receptor, if appropriate. The report discusses 
      the data supporting the approval decision, specifically highlighting the
      incorporation of a companion diagnostic in the key study and the optimal dose of 
      pembrolizumab.

AB  - Pembrolizumab, an anti-programmed death-1 monoclonal antibody, has been approved 
      by the Food and Drug Administration in 2014 on the basis of improved
      progression-free and overall survival in metastatic melanoma. We report for the
      first time a successful treatment with a programmed death-1 antibody in a
      69-year-old metastastic melanoma patient with a Churg-Strauss lung vasculitis and
      a prior ipilimumab-induced autoimmune colitis. This case report suggests that
      pembrolizumab can be given with caution to patients with underlying autoimmune
      disease. As the use of checkpoint inhibitors expands, knowledge about their
      safety in patients with underlying autoimmune diseases will become increasingly
      important, in particular because these patients are typically excluded from
      clinical trials with immune-checkpoint inhibitors.

TI  - Anaemia in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease - A Nationwide
      Cross-Sectional Study.
PG  - 214-20
LID - 10.1159/000443927 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anaemia is the most common complication in patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD). This study aims to assess the prevalence of anaemia in IBD
      patients and to know its characteristics with regard to the main IBD clinical
      features. METHODS: An observational cross-sectional multicentre study was
      conducted. We included all patients who had an appointment at the 15
      participating centres during the period of 1 month, and who met the following
      selection criteria: age >/=18, diagnosis of IBD. Disease activity was evaluated
      by Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) for Crohn's disease (CD), and by Simple Clinical
      Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI) for ulcerative colitis (UC). RESULTS: One thousand
      three hundred and thirteen patients, were included: 54.8% female, mean age 42.8
      (interquartile range (25th-75th): 31-53 years), 59% had a diagnosis of CD, 39% of
      UC and 2% IBD unclassified. The median follow-up since diagnosis was 7 years. The
      ongoing treatment was aminosalicylates (63.1%), corticosteroids (11.6%),
      immunomodulators (36.4%) and anti-tumour necrosis factor (27.3%). Anaemia was
      identified in 244 patients, representing a prevalence of 18.6% (95% CI
      16.6-20.9). A majority of cases (90%) have mild/moderate anaemia (mean
      haemoglobin 11.3 +/- 0.8 g/dl). Anaemia was significantly higher in females (p = 
      0.006), but there were no differences between CDs (19.1%) and UCs (17.7%; p =
      0.688). Anaemia was more frequent in patients with active disease (HBI >4; SCCAI 
      >2) than in those in clinical remission (33.6 vs. 15.6%, p < 0.001) and in
      patients on steroids (36.8%) vs. other treatments (p < 0.001). Only 47% of
      patients with anaemia were under any specific treatment (oral iron 67%;
      intravenous iron 41%). CONCLUSION: Anaemia was more frequent in patients with
      active disease and in those on corticosteroids. The treatment of anaemia still
      seems undervalued, whereas more than half of anaemic patients were not receiving 
      any specific treatment and the use of oral iron prevails contrarily to current
      recommendations.

TI  - Comparison of the Efficacies of Parenteral Iron Sucrose and Oral Iron Sulfate for
      Anemic Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Korea.
PG  - 562-8
LID - 10.5009/gnl15373 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The optimal route for iron administration in anemic patients
      with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has not been determined. The aim of this
      study was to compare the efficacies of parenteral and oral iron therapy in IBD
      patients in Korea. METHODS: A retrospective multicenter study was performed.
      Patients who had been administered parenteral iron were matched to the controls
      with oral iron at a 1:1 ratio according to age, sex, and type of IBD. RESULTS:
      Patients that received parenteral iron exhibited increases in hemoglobin levels
      of >/=20% from the baseline at lower doses and in shorter durations (p=0.034 and 
      p=0.046, respectively). In the multivariate analysis, parenteral iron therapy
      appeared to be more efficient than oral iron therapy, but this difference was not
      statistically significant (hazard ratio [HR], 1.552; 95% confidence interval
      [CI], 0.844 to 2.851; p=0.157). Patients with ulcerative colitis responded better
      to iron therapy than those with Crohn's disease (HR, 3.415; 95% CI, 1.808 to
      6.450; p<0.001). Patients with an initial hemoglobin level of 10 g/dL or higher
      responded poorly to iron therapy (HR, 0.345; 95% CI, 0.177 to 0.671; p=0.002).
      CONCLUSIONS: Parenteral iron therapy appears to be more efficient than oral iron 
      therapy. Physicians should focus on the iron deficiency of IBD patients and
      consider parenteral iron supplements in appropriate patient groups.

AB  - Our recent study has demonstrated that medium chain triglycerides (MCT) and
      monounsaturated fatty acids potentiate the beneficial effects of fish oil on risk
      factors of cardiovascular disease. In the present study, we have investigated the
      influence of MCT or olive oil on the protective and mucosal healing ability of
      fish oil in ulcerative colitis using cell simulation and animal models. Caco-2
      cells grown in medium chain fatty acids enriched medium has exaggerated t-butyl
      hydroperoxide induced cell damage, GSH depletion, and IL-1beta induced IL-8
      synthesis, compared to the cells grown in oleic acid & hydroxytyrosol (OT)
      enriched medium. Further, combined treatment of cells with eicosapentaenoic acid,
      docosahexaenoic acid, and OT has remarkably attenuated the cell damage, and IL-8 
      synthesis, compared to individual treatments. To evaluate the effect of these
      lipid formulations in vivo, adult Wistar rats were fed diet enriched with high
      amount of medium chain triglycerides (MCT), virgin olive oil, or their
      combination with fish oil. Colitis was induced in rats using dextran sulfate
      sodium (DSS) for 7days followed by 10-days of recovery period. Rats of MCT group 
      exhibit severe disease activity, higher levels of inflammatory cytokines in the
      colon compared to the olive oil group. Furthermore, there was persistent body
      weight loss, loose stools, higher levels of inflammatory cytokines in the rats of
      MCT group, even after DSS was withdrawn from drinking water. Conversely, fish oil
      has remarkably attenuated the DSS induced alterations in both MCT and olive oil
      diet groups with significantly greater effect in the olive oil group. Thus, MCT
      increase the susceptibility to colitis through oxidative damage and IL-8
      synthesis in intestinal epithelial cells. The beneficial effects of virgin olive 
      oil could be partially attributed to hydroxytyrosol. Combined treatment of
      hydroxytyrosol, oleic acid and n-3 fatty acids exhibit huge therapeutic benefits 
      in colitis.

AB  - Glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR), which exists mainly in
      the liver, is a D-2-hydroxy-acid dehydrogenase that plays a critical role in the 
      formation of primary hyperoxaluria type 2 (PH2). Here, we investigated GRHPR
      expression and its potential role in both human Crohn's disease (CD) and
      experimental colitis. Murine experimental colitis models were established by
      administration of trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS). As shown by Western blot,
      significant up-regulation of GRHPR was found in TNBS-treated mice as compared
      with normal controls. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) also showed increased GRHPR
      expression, and the molecule was located in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs).
      This phenomenon also occurred in patients with Crohn's disease. Besides, in an in
      vitro study, human IEC line HT-29 cells cultured with tumor necrosis factor alpha
      (TNF-alpha) were used to evaluate the changes in expression of GRHPR. Moreover,
      overexpression of GRHPR was accompanied by active caspase-3 and cleaved poly
      ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) accumulation. Furthermore, knock-down GRHPR could
      inhibit the accumulation of active caspase-3 and cleaved PARP as shown by Western
      blot in TNF-alpha treated HT-29 cells. Flow cytometry assay indicated that
      interference of GRHPR led to increasing apoptosis of IECs. These data suggested
      that GRHPR might exert its pro-apoptosis function in IECs. Thus, GRHPR might play
      an important role in regulating IECs apoptosis, and might be a potential
      therapeutic target for CD.

TI  - Endocytosis in enterocytes.
PG  - 205-10
LID - 10.1007/s10354-016-0448-z [doi]
AB  - Endocytosis is a fundamental cell biological process, which carries out essential
      functions in a polarized epithelial cell such as enterocytes provided with a huge
      surface area of the brush border membrane. Major tasks of enterocytes, which are 
      regulated by endocytic signals, are digestion and absorption of nutrients and
      drugs/pharmacological agents, barrier permeability to microorganism, toxins and
      antigens, and transcytotic crosstalk between intestinal lumen and lamina propria 
      cells with access to the circulation.Investigations on inflammatory bowel
      diseases such as food allergy, celiac disease, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative
      colitis focus on immune processes originating within enterocytes as antigen
      presenting cells. Thus the initiation of oral tolerance, that is, the binding of 
      food antigens to MHC class II proteins, might be localized within late endosomes 
      of enterocytes. Furthermore, the late endosomal compartment of enterocytes seems 
      to be involved in the processing of luminal antigens during the pathogenesis of
      celiac disease and inflammatory bowel diseases. Investigations of inherited
      diseases such as microvillus inclusion disease have revealed a pathogenetic
      defect in the autophagocytotic and/or recycling pathway of enterocytes.Our
      progress in the cell and molecular biological understanding of the endocytosis
      and the methodical opportunities of translational research offer now new
      therapeutic options for patients suffering from endocytosis-related diseases of
      enterocytes.

AB  - Since World War II, several factors such as an impressive industrial growth, an
      enhanced environmental bioavailability and intensified food consumption have
      contributed to a significant amplification of human exposure to aluminum.
      Aluminum is particularly present in food, beverages, some drugs and airbone dust.
      In our food, aluminum is superimposed via additives and cooking utensils.
      Therefore, the tolerable intake of aluminum is exceeded for a significant part of
      the world population, especially in children who are more vulnerable to toxic
      effects of pollutants than adults. Faced with this oral aluminum influx,
      intestinal tract is an essential barrier, especially as 38% of ingested aluminum 
      accumulates at the intestinal mucosa. Although still poorly documented to date,
      the impact of oral exposure to aluminum in conditions relevant to real human
      exposure appears to be deleterious for gut homeostasis. Aluminum ingestion
      affects the regulation of the permeability, the microflora and the immune
      function of intestine. Nowadays, several arguments are consistent with an
      involvement of aluminum as an environmental risk factor for inflammatory bowel
      diseases.

AB  - The therapeutic effect of 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 and its analog (paricalcitol) on
      experimental colitis in animals has been heavily demonstrated. However, the
      response to Cholecalciterol Cholesterol Emulsion (CCE), a precursor of 1,25(OH)2 
      vitamin D3, has not yet been reported. Whether pyroptosis is involved in colitic 
      deterioration also remains unclear. Therefore, we adopted molecular biology and
      histology approaches to examine mechanisms by which CCE was able to regulate
      experimental colitis in the animal model induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic
      acid (TNBS). Our data revealed that mice displayed a remarkable reduction in
      colonic histological scores, colonic inflammation and colonic histological
      damage. In addition, there was an overall improvement in general status (change
      in body weight, food and water intake, mental status, activity) and a 30%
      increase in survival rate due to the downregulation of pyroptosis following
      treatment with CCE. In conclusion, our data have provided evidence that CCE can
      attenuate the damage of experimental colitis by suppressing pyroptosis signaling.

      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 266-73
LID - 10.1111/imj.13003 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases are thought to develop as a result of dysregulation
      of the relationship that exists between the gut microbiota, host genetics and the
      immune system. The advent of culture-independent techniques has revolutionised
      the ability to characterise the role of the gut microbiota in health and disease 
      based on the microbiota's genetic make-up. Inflammatory bowel diseases are
      characterised by dysbiosis which is an imbalance between pro- and
      anti-inflammatory bacteria and a reduction in bacterial diversity. Emerging data 
      suggest that it is not only the presence of the gut microbiota but the functional
      activity of the microbiota that appears to play an important role in health and
      disease. Current strategies to manipulate therapeutically the gut microbiota
      using dietary modification, prebiotics, probiotics, antibiotics and faecal
      microbiota transplantation aim to restore the balance to a state of normobiosis. 
      However, the ability of such strategies to correct dysbiosis and thereby achieve 
      therapeutic benefit is yet to be fully characterised.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To discuss current terminology and the regulatory standards and
      processes involved in the development of biosimilars. METHODS: An Internet-based 
      literature search through April 2015 was performed for information related to
      biosimilars in chronic inflammatory disorders. Keywords were as follows:
      biosimilar, development, manufacturing, characterization, structural, functional,
      preclinical, clinical, immunogenicity, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic 
      arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohns disease, ulcerative colitis,
      and ankylosing spondylitis. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) and US Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA) websites were searched for guidelines and information
      related to biosimilars. RESULTS: Biosimilars are products that are highly similar
      to the reference product regarding quality, biological activity, safety, and
      efficacy. Biosimilars are biological products and not generic drugs and, thus, do
      not follow the same regulatory pathways as generic molecules. Rigorous
      early-stage structural, functional, and analytical testing, followed by
      nonclinical and clinical analyses comparing a biosimilar with its reference
      product, are required to demonstrate biosimilarity in regulatory markets
      worldwide. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of biosimilars to the market has the
      potential to improve access to biologic therapies. Many regulatory agencies have 
      enacted stringent pathways, which must be followed for a biosimilar to be labeled
      and approved as such; following the pathways will help protect and maintain the
      integrity, quality, and safety of the biosimilar product.

TI  - Growth in Egg Yolk Enhances Salmonella Enteritidis Colonization and Virulence in 
      a Mouse Model of Human Colitis.
PG  - e0150258
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0150258 [doi]
AB  - Salmonella Enteritidis (SE) is one of the most common causes of bacterial
      food-borne illnesses in the world. Despite the SE's ability to colonize and
      infect a wide-range of host, the most common source of infection continues to be 
      the consumption of contaminated shell eggs and egg-based products. To date, the
      role of the source of SE infection has not been studied as it relates to SE
      pathogenesis and resulting disease. Using a streptomycin-treated mouse model of
      human colitis, this study examined the virulence of SE grown in egg yolk and
      Luria Bertani (LB) broth, and mouse feces collected from mice experimentally
      infected with SEE1 (SEE1 passed through mice). Primary observations revealed that
      the mice infected with SE grown in egg yolk displayed greater illness and disease
      markers than those infected with SE passed through mice or grown in LB broth.
      Furthermore, the SE grown in egg yolk achieved higher rates of colonization in
      the mouse intestines and extra-intestinal organs of infected mice than the SE
      from LB broth or mouse feces. Our results here indicate that the source of SE
      infection may contribute to the overall pathogenesis of SE in a second host.
      These results also suggest that reservoir-pathogen dynamics may be critical for
      SE's ability to establish colonization and priming for virulence potential.

      Responses to a Compromised Mucus Barrier.
PG  - 826-40
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000688 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our aims were (1) to correlate changes in the microbiota to
      intestinal gene expression before and during the development of colitis in Muc2
      mice and (2) to investigate whether the heterozygote Muc2 mouse would reveal host
      markers of gut barrier stress. METHODS: Colon histology, transcriptomics, and
      microbiota profiling of faecal samples was performed on wild type, Muc2, and Muc2
      mice at 2, 4, and 8 weeks of age. RESULTS: Muc2 mice develop colitis in proximal 
      colon after weaning, resulting in inflammatory and adaptive immune responses, and
      expression of genes associated with human inflammatory bowel disease. Muc2 mice
      do not develop colitis, but produce a thinner mucus layer. The transcriptome of
      Muc2 mice revealed differential expression of genes participating in mucosal
      stress responses and exacerbation of a transient inflammatory state around the
      time of weaning. Young wild type and Muc2 mice have a more constrained group of
      bacteria as compared with the Muc2 mice, but at 8 weeks the microbiota
      composition is more similar in all mice. At all ages, microbiota composition
      discriminated the groups of mice according to their genotype. Specific bacterial 
      clusters correlated with altered gene expression responses to stress and
      bacteria, before colitis development, including colitogenic members of the genus 
      Bacteroides. CONCLUSIONS: The abundance of Bacteroides pathobionts increased
      before histological signs of pathology suggesting they may play a role in
      triggering the development of colitis. The Muc2 mouse produces a thinner mucus
      layer and can be used to study mucus barrier stress in the absence of colitis.

TI  - Vitamin D supplementation in inflammatory bowel disease: the role of dosage and
      patient compliance.
PG  - 148-51
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Vitamin D substitution is recommended in patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease. Specific guidelines are lacking. The aim of this study was to
      assess the effect of vitamin D supplementation with respect to dosage and patient
      compliance. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of 167 Crohn disease/ulcerative
      colitis outpatients. Patients were screened for serum vitamin D (25OHD2+3) at the
      end of summer and in late winter. Demographic data, history of vitamin D
      supplementation were recorded and matched with prescription records. RESULTS: A
      total of 57 subjects used vitamin D supplementation (mean dose 1104 IU/day).
      25OHD2+3 levels were lower (p < 0.001) in winter both in substituted and
      unsubstituted group, without any differences between groups within the same
      season. 25OHD2+3 levels did not correlate with the substitution dose. 52.1 % of
      subjects were fully compliant with substitution. 25OHD2+3 and prevalence of
      vitamin D deficit in this group were comparable with unsubstituted subjects
      except a higher prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency (p < 0.02). CONCLUSION:
      Fixed dosage of 1100 IU/day of vitamin D was insufficient to correct the
      deficiency. Patient compliance with vitamin D supplementation was low, however
      this fact did not significantly contribute to the degree of vitamin D deficiency 
      in this dosage (Tab. 3, Fig. 1, Ref. 21).

PG  - 437-44
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000001170 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Diet assessment is essential in the care of patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We aimed to study food intake in children with 
      IBD and evaluated the relation of dietary intake with disease activity and
      nutritional status in these children. METHODS: This cross-sectional study
      investigated 68 children and adolescents with IBD (57 Crohn disease, 11
      ulcerative colitis). Evaluation included clinical, laboratory, and nutritional
      assessment including 3 days diet record. RESULTS: Compared with recommended daily
      allowance, the intake of patients with IBD was significantly poor for
      carbohydrates (75%, P = 0.016), calcium (49%, P < 0.05), magnesium (76%, P <
      0.05), vitamin A (72%, P < 0.05), vitamin E (57%, P < 0.05), and fiber (44%, P < 
      0.05) and higher for protein (175%, P < 0.05), iron (112%, P < 0.05), and
      water-soluble vitamins (118%-189% P < 0.05). Compared with the intakes of healthy
      children from National Nutritional Survey, the intake of IBD group was lower for 
      calories (78%, P = 0.012), carbohydrates (61% P < 0.05), magnesium (67% P <
      0.05), vitamin C (34%, P < 0.05), and fiber (54%, P < 0.05) and high for B12
      (141%, P < 0.05). Fifty subjects ate ordinary diets, 7 of 68 children were on
      exclusive enteral nutrition and 11 of 68 consumed regular food with different
      polymeric formulas supplements. Compared with children without supplements,
      children on exclusive enteral nutrition and nutritional supplements (18/68) had
      significantly better intakes of energy (1870 +/- 755 vs 2267 +/- 432, P < 0.05), 
      carbohydrates (223 +/- 97 vs 292 +/- 99, P < 0.05), and all minerals (P < 0.05)
      and micronutrients (P < 0.05). Dietary intake was not different by disease status
      (remission or relapse). CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of nutritional supplements,
      food intake is inadequate for many nutrients in many children with IBD.

TI  - Paediatric non-IgE mediated food allergy: guide for practitioners.
PG  - 78-88
AB  - AIM: Food avoidance in children is increasingly common due to concerns about
      allergy. We aim to review the current literature on paediatric non-IgE mediated
      food allergy including what is known about pathophysiology, diagnosis, management
      and prognosis of common and severe presentations. Considerations regarding
      appropriate formula selection are also presented. METHODS: Common non-IgE
      mediated conditions were searched through common medical databases. Thorough
      review of available literature was then synthesised and critically appraised.
      RESULTS: Current understanding of immunological mechanisms of most non-IgE
      mediated conditions remains elusive. Most conditions are outgrown in childhood
      and have a good prognosis. Dietary modification for some conditions is important 
      to ensure safety. They are not recommended in all situations due to potentially
      harmful consequences. CONCLUSION: Assessment of children with concerns regarding 
      non-IgE mediated conditions requires a thorough history and is generally not
      supported by reliable diagnostic tests. Caution is warranted when advising
      families to undertake dietary exclusions unless well supported by the evidence
      and ensuring benefits outweigh any potential harm.

TI  - Probiotic Yogurt Culture Bifidobacterium Animalis Subsp. Lactis BB-12 and
      Lactobacillus Acidophilus LA-5 Modulate the Cytokine Secretion by Peripheral
      Blood Mononuclear Cells from Patients with Ulcerative Colitis.
PG  - 300-5
LID - 10.1055/s-0035-1569414 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are some evidences for the immunomodulation disorders in the
      response to intestinal microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease. Yogurt is a
      fermented milk product made with a starter culture consisting of different
      probiotics which could be colonized in intestine. However, the role of probiotics
      in the aetiopathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC) has not been clarified. To
      determine how the immune system responds to these bacteria this study was
      planned. METHODS: Bifidobacterium lactis BB-12 (B. lactis) and Lactobacillus
      acidophilus LA-5 (L. acidophilus) were cultivated on MRS broth. PBMCs of 36 UC
      patients were separated by Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation and co-cultured with
      different concentrations of UV killed bacteria in RPMI-1 640 plus 10% FCS for
      48/72 h. IL-10, TGF-beta, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha were measured in supernatant of
      PBMCs by ELISA. RESULTS: Both bacteria significantly augmented IL-10, TGF-beta,
      IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha compared to control (p<0.001). The secretion levels of
      IL-10 and TGF-beta by B. lactis- compared to L. acidophilus-stimulated PBMCs were
      significantly higher (p<0.05, p<0.01 respectively). The secretion levels of
      TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma by PBMCs after 72 h were significantly lower compared to 
      48 h stimulation by B. lactis (p<0.001, p<0.035 respectively). CONCLUSION: These 
      data show that both probiotics may trigger the pro- and anti-inflammatory immune 
      response of UC patients. It seems that IL-10/TGF-beta uprising by B. lactis could
      be the reason of TNF-alpha/IFN-gamma reduction. Therefore albeit B. lactis still 
      stimulates the effector Th cells but because of more stimulatory effect on Tregs,
      it could be a good potential therapeutic candidate for further investigation.

TI  - Diet therapy for inflammatory bowel diseases: The established and the new.
PG  - 2179-94
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i7.2179 [doi]
AB  - Although patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have a strong interest
      in dietary modifications as part of their therapeutic management, dietary advice 
      plays only a minor part in published guidelines. The scientific literature shows 
      that dietary factors might influence the risk of developing IBD, that dysbiosis
      induced by nutrition contributes to the pathogenesis of IBD, and that diet may
      serve as a symptomatic treatment for irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms in
      IBD. The role of nutrition in IBD is underscored by the effect of various dietary
      therapies. In paediatric patients with Crohn's disease (CD) enteral nutrition
      (EN) reaches remission rates similar to steroids. In adult patients, however, EN 
      is inferior to corticosteroids. EN is not effective in ulcerative colitis (UC).
      Total parenteral nutrition in IBD is not superior to steroids or EN. The use of
      specific probiotics in patients with IBD can be recommended only in special
      clinical situations. There is no evidence for efficacy of probiotics in CD. By
      contrast, studies in UC have shown a beneficial effect in selected patients. For 
      patients with pouchitis, antibiotic treatment followed by probiotics, like VSL#3 
      or Lactobacillus GG, is effective. When probiotics are used, the risk of
      bacterial translocation and subsequent bacteremia has to be considered. More
      understanding of the normal intestinal microflora, and better characterization of
      probiotic strains at the phenotypic and genomic levels is needed as well as
      clarification of the mechanisms of action in different clinical settings. A
      FODMAP reduced diet may improve symptoms in IBD.

TI  - Inflammation increases NOTCH1 activity via MMP9 and is counteracted by
      Eicosapentaenoic Acid-free fatty acid in colon cancer cells.
PG  - 20670
LID - 10.1038/srep20670 [doi]
AB  - Aberrant NOTCH1 signalling is critically involved in multiple models of
      colorectal cancer (CRC) and a prominent role of NOTCH1 activity during
      inflammation has emerged. Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), a crucial
      event promoting malignant transformation, is regulated by inflammation and
      Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) plays an important role in this process.
      Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA), an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, was shown to 
      prevent colonic tumors in different settings. We recently found that an
      extra-pure formulation of EPA as Free Fatty Acid (EPA-FFA) protects from colon
      cancer development in a mouse model of Colitis-Associated Cancer (CAC) through
      modulation of NOTCH1 signalling. In this study, we exposed colon cancer cells to 
      an inflammatory stimulus represented by a cytokine-enriched Conditioned Medium
      (CM), obtained from THP1-differentiated macrophages. We found, for the first
      time, that CM strongly up-regulated NOTCH1 signalling and EMT markers, leading to
      increased invasiveness. Importantly, NOTCH1 signalling was dependent on MMP9
      activity, upon CM exposure. We show that a non-cytotoxic pre-treatment with
      EPA-FFA antagonizes the effect of inflammation on NOTCH1 signalling, with
      reduction of MMP9 activity and invasiveness. In conclusion, our data suggest
      that, in CRC cells, inflammation induces NOTCH1 activity through MMP9
      up-regulation and that this mechanism can be counteracted by EPA-FFA.

AB  - Mast cells are constitutively found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The three
      major physiological functions of GI mast cells comprise of - as far as we know - 
      regulation of GI functions, namely epithelial and endothelial functions,
      crosstalk with the enteric nervous system, and contribution to the host defense
      against bacterial, viral and parasitic agents. A number of chronic GI diseases,
      including inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis),
      celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and food allergies, are thought to be
      associated with mast cell hyperplasia and humoral activity. Clinical conditions
      characterized by a decrease in mast cell functionality are not known so far. In
      the present review, we summarize current evidence which show that human mast
      cells play a central role at the GI barrier, both in health and disease.

TI  - Titanium dioxide nanoparticles exacerbate DSS-induced colitis: role of the NLRP3 
      inflammasome.
PG  - 1216-1224
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2015-310297 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Western lifestyle and diet are major environmental factors playing a
      role in the development of IBD. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles are widely 
      used as food additives or in pharmaceutical formulations and are consumed by
      millions of people on a daily basis. We investigated the effects of TiO2 in the
      development of colitis and the role of the nucleotide-binding oligomerisation
      domain receptor, pyrin domain containing (NLRP)3 inflammasome. DESIGN: Wild-type 
      and NLRP3-deficient mice with dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis were orally 
      administered with TiO2 nanoparticles. The proinflammatory effects of TiO2
      particles in cultured human intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and macrophages
      were also studied, as well as the ability of TiO2 crystals to traverse IEC
      monolayers and accumulate in the blood of patients with IBD using inductively
      coupled plasma mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Oral administration of TiO2
      nanoparticles worsened acute colitis through a mechanism involving the NLRP3
      inflammasome. Importantly, crystals were found to accumulate in spleen of
      TiO2-administered mice. In vitro, TiO2 particles were taken up by IECs and
      macrophages and triggered NLRP3-ASC-caspase-1 assembly, caspase-1 cleavage and
      the release of NLRP3-associated interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-18. TiO2 also
      induced reactive oxygen species generation and increased epithelial permeability 
      in IEC monolayers. Increased levels of titanium were found in blood of patients
      with UC having active disease. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that
      individuals with a defective intestinal barrier function and pre-existing
      inflammatory condition, such as IBD, might be negatively impacted by the use of
      TiO2 nanoparticles.

TI  - Oral versus intravenous iron replacement therapy distinctly alters the gut
      microbiota and metabolome in patients with IBD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Iron deficiency is a common complication in patients with IBD and oral
      iron therapy is suggested to exacerbate IBD symptoms. We performed an
      open-labelled clinical trial to compare the effects of per oral (PO) versus
      intravenous (IV) iron replacement therapy (IRT). DESIGN: The study population
      included patients with Crohn's disease (CD; N=31), UC (N=22) and control subjects
      with iron deficiency (non-inflamed, NI=19). After randomisation, participants
      received iron sulfate (PO) or iron sucrose (IV) over 3 months. Clinical
      parameters, faecal bacterial communities and metabolomes were assessed before and
      after intervention. RESULTS: Both PO and IV treatments ameliorated iron
      deficiency, but higher ferritin levels were observed with IV. Changes in disease 
      activity were independent of iron treatment types. Faecal samples in IBD were
      characterised by marked interindividual differences, lower phylotype richness and
      proportions of Clostridiales. Metabolite analysis also showed separation of both 
      UC and CD from control anaemic participants. Major shifts in bacterial diversity 
      occurred in approximately half of all participants after IRT, but patients with
      CD were most susceptible. Despite individual-specific changes in phylotypes due
      to IRT, PO treatment was associated with decreased abundances of operational
      taxonomic units assigned to the species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii,
      Ruminococcus bromii, Dorea sp. and Collinsella aerofaciens. Clear IV-specific and
      PO-specific fingerprints were evident at the level of metabolomes, with changes
      affecting cholesterol-derived host substrates. CONCLUSIONS: Shifts in gut
      bacterial diversity and composition associated with iron treatment are pronounced
      in IBD participants. Despite similar clinical outcome, oral administration
      differentially affects bacterial phylotypes and faecal metabolites compared with 
      IV therapy. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: clinicaltrial.gov (NCT01067547).

TI  - Human oral isolate Lactobacillus fermentum AGR1487 induces a pro-inflammatory
      response in germ-free rat colons.
PG  - 20318
LID - 10.1038/srep20318 [doi]
AB  - Lactobacilli are thought to be beneficial for human health, with
      lactobacilli-associated infections being confined to immune-compromised
      individuals. However, Lactobacillus fermentum AGR1487 negatively affects barrier 
      integrity in vitro so we hypothesized that it caused a pro-inflammatory response 
      in the host. We compared germ-free rats inoculated with AGR1487 to those
      inoculated with another L. fermentum strain, AGR1485, which does not affect in
      vitro barrier integrity. We showed that rats inoculated with AGR1487 had more
      inflammatory cells in their colon, higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers, and 
      increased colonic gene expression of pro-inflammatory pathways. In addition, our 
      in vitro studies showed that AGR1487 had a greater capacity to activate TLR
      signaling and induce pro-inflammatory cytokines in immune cells. This study
      indicates the potential of strains of the same species to differentially elicit
      inflammatory responses in the host and highlights the importance of strain
      characterization in probiotic approaches to treat inflammatory disorders.

TI  - Different Effects of Three Selected Lactobacillus Strains in Dextran Sulfate
      Sodium-Induced Colitis in BALB/c Mice.
PG  - e0148241
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0148241 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To analyze the changes of different Lactobacillus species in ulcerative
      colitis patients and to further assess the therapeutic effects of selected
      Lactobacillus strains on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced experimental
      colitis in BALB/c mice. METHODS: Forty-five active ulcerative colitis (UC)
      patients and 45 population-based healthy controls were enrolled. Polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) amplification and real-time PCR were performed for qualitative and
      quantitative analyses, respectively, of the Lactobacillus species in UC patients.
      Three Lactobacillus strains from three species were selected to assess the
      therapeutic effects on experimental colitis. Sixty 8-week-old BALB/c mice were
      divided into six groups. The five groups that had received DSS were administered 
      normal saline, mesalazine, L. fermentum CCTCC M206110 strain, L. crispatus CCTCC 
      M206119 strain, or L. plantarum NCIMB8826 strain. We assessed the severity of
      colitis based on disease activity index (DAI), body weight loss, colon length,
      and histologic damage. RESULTS: The detection rate of four of the 11
      Lactobacillus species decreased significantly (P < 0.05), and the detection rate 
      of two of the 11 Lactobacillus species increased significantly (P < 0.05) in UC
      patients. Relative quantitative analysis revealed that eight Lactobacillus
      species declined significantly in UC patients (P < 0.05), while three
      Lactobacillus species increased significantly (P < 0.05). The CCTCC M206110
      treatment group had less weight loss and colon length shortening, lower DAI
      scores, and lower histologic scores (P < 0.05), while the CCTCC M206119 treatment
      group had greater weight loss and colon length shortening, higher histologic
      scores, and more severe inflammatory infiltration (P < 0.05). NCIMB8826 improved 
      weight loss and colon length shortening (P < 0.05) with no significant influence 
      on DAI and histologic damage in the colitis model. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of
      an L. crispatus CCTCC M206119 supplement aggravated DSS-induced colitis. L.
      fermentum CCTCC M206110 proved to be effective at attenuating DSS-induced
      colitis. The potential probiotic effect of L. plantarum NCIMB8826 on UC has yet
      to be assessed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the interaction of single nucleotide polymorphisms of
      macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) gene -173G/C and glutathione
      peroxidase 1(GPX1) gene 594C/T polymorphisms and high-fat diet in ulcerative
      colitis (UC). METHODS: The genetic polymorphisms of MIF -173G/C and GPX1 594C/T
      were determined with a polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-endonuclease 
      method in peripheral blood leukocytes derived from 1500 UC cases and 1500 healthy
      controls. RESULTS: The frequencies of MIF -173CC and GPX1 594TT were 55.60% and
      55.73% in the UC cases and 16.67% and 16.47% in the healthy controls,
      respectively. Statistical tests also showed a significant difference in the
      frequencies between the two groups (P<0.01; P<0.01, respectively). Individuals
      carrying MIF -173CC also had a significantly higher risk of UC compared with
      those with MIF -173GG (OR=6.8662, 95%CI: 4.5384-9.6158). Individuals carrying
      GPX1 594TT had a high risk of UC (OR=7.0854, 95%CI: 4.4702-10.5283). Combined
      analysis showed that the percentages of MIF -173CC/GPX1 594TT in the UC and
      control groups were 31.00% and 2.73%, respectively (P<0.01). Individuals carrying
      MIF -173CC/GPX1 594TT had a high risk of UC (OR=49.0113, 95%CI: 31.7364-61.8205).
      The high-fat diet rate of the case group was significantly higher than that of
      the control group (OR=3.3248, 95%CI: 1.9461-5.0193, P<0.01), and statistic
      analysis suggested an interaction between high-fat diet and MIF -173CC and GPX1
      594TT which increase risk of UC (gamma =6.9293; gamma =6.9942). CONCLUSION: MIF
      -173CC and GPX1 594TT and high-fat diet are the risk factors for UC, and the
      significant interactions between genetic polymorphisms of MIF -173G/C, GPX1
      594C/T and high-fat diet may increase the risk for UC.

TI  - A New Immunoassay for Detecting All Subtypes of Shiga Toxins Produced by Shiga
      Toxin-Producing E. coli in Ground Beef.
PG  - e0148092
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0148092 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Shiga toxin (Stx) is a common virulence factor of all Shiga toxin
      producing E. coli (STEC) that cause a wide spectrum of disease, including
      hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Although several
      commercial kits are available for detection of Stx produced by STEC, none of them
      are capable of recognizing all subtypes of Stxs, which include three subtypes of 
      Stx1 and seven subtypes of Stx2. METHODS AND FINDINGS: New monoclonal and
      polyclonal antibodies against Stx1 and Stx2 were developed. A universal sandwich 
      ELISA capable of detecting all known subtypes of Stx1 and Stx2 was established
      using a pool of newly developed antibodies. To precisely monitor the sensitivity 
      of the assay for each subtype of Stxs, recombinant toxoids were created and used 
      as standards in ELISAs. Because of the high affinity of the antibodies
      incorporated, the ELISA assay is highly sensitive with a limit of detection for
      the different subtypes of Stx1a and Stx2a between 10 and 50 pg/mL in phosphate
      buffered saline (PBS). The assay was also able to identify STEC based on the
      production of Stxs using the supernatants of culture fluids or even single
      colonies on agar plates without lengthy enrichment in liquid medium. When applied
      to ground beef samples, this newly developed ELISA was capable of distinguishing 
      beef samples spiked with a single bacterial cell. CONCLUSIONS: A highly sensitive
      and universal assay for all subtypes of Stx1 and Stx2 was developed. It has
      significantly improved upon the current technologies by avoiding false negative
      results due to the narrow detection range of the assay. The assay developed in
      this study can be useful for prompt detection of new and emerging serotypes and
      screening ground beef samples for contamination of STEC at an early stage in the 
      food supply chain, thus avoiding the need for possible recall.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Anti-integrin therapy for the treatment of patients with Crohn's
      disease is rapidly evolving. Two agents, natalizumab and vedolizumab, are
      approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of
      Crohn's disease, with vedolizumab the primary anti-integrin used due to a more
      favorable safety profile. Several other anti-integrins are in various stages of
      development. AREAS COVERED: This review discusses the current state of
      anti-integrin therapy as well as suggestions for positioning of these agents in
      clinical practice. Emerging anti-integrin therapies, their underlying mechanisms 
      of action, and available safety and clinical data are also reviewed. EXPERT
      OPINION: Anti-integrins are effective for the treatment of Crohn's disease, even 
      in patients refractory to other therapies. Their use should be considered in
      patients with Crohn's disease who do not respond to, develop non-response to, or 
      have contraindications to anti-TNF therapy. Anti-integrin therapies can be
      offered as a first biologic therapy, in particular for older patients, patients
      with concurrent multiple sclerosis (natalizumab only), and in patients with
      contraindications to anti-TNF therapy. In patients with more severe symptoms,
      providers should consider co-induction with corticosteroids if possible to hasten
      remission.

PG  - 974-95
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i3.974 [doi]
AB  - In the gut, where billions of non-self-antigens from the food and the microbiota 
      are present, the immune response must be tightly regulated to ensure both host
      protection against pathogenic microorganisms and the absence of immune-related
      pathologies. It has been well documented that regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a
      pivotal role in this context. Indeed, Tregs are able to prevent excessive
      inflammation, which can lead to the rupture of intestinal homeostasis observed in
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Both the worldwide incidence and prevalence
      of such diseases have increased throughout the latter part of the 20(th) century.
      Therefore, it is crucial to understand how Tregs suppress the colitogenic immune 
      cells to establish new treatments for patients suffering from IBDs. In this
      review, we will first summarize the results obtained in animal model studies that
      highlight the importance of Tregs in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and
      describe the specific suppressive mechanisms involved. Next, our current
      knowledge about Tregs contribution to human IBDs will be reviewed, as well as the
      current therapeutic perspective on using Tregs for clinical IBD treatment and the
      challenges that remain to be resolved to ensure both the safety and effectiveness
      of these therapies in targeting this critical immune-regulatory cell population.

TI  - Protective links between vitamin D, inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer.
PG  - 933-48
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i3.933 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with a wide range of diseases and
      multiple forms of cancer including breast, colon, and prostate cancers.
      Relatively recent work has demonstrated vitamin D to be critical in immune
      function and therefore important in inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD). Because vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency is
      increasingly prevalent around the world, with an estimated 30%-50% of children
      and adults at risk for vitamin D deficiency worldwide, it could have a
      significant impact on IBD. Epidemiologic studies suggest that low serum vitamin D
      levels are a risk factor for IBD and colon cancer, and vitamin D supplementation 
      is associated with decreased colitis disease activity and/or alleviated symptoms.
      Patients diagnosed with IBD have a higher incidence of colorectal cancer than the
      general population, which supports the notion that inflammation plays a key role 
      in cancer development and underscores the importance of understanding how vitamin
      D influences inflammation and its cancer-promoting effects. In addition to human 
      epidemiological data, studies utilizing mouse models of colitis have shown that
      vitamin D is beneficial in preventing or ameliorating inflammation and clinical
      disease. The precise role of vitamin D on colitis is unknown; however, vitamin D 
      regulates immune cell trafficking and differentiation, gut barrier function and
      antimicrobial peptide synthesis, all of which may be protective from IBD and
      colon cancer. Here we focus on effects of vitamin D on inflammation and
      inflammation-associated colon cancer and discuss the potential use of vitamin D
      for protection and treatment of IBD and colon cancer.

TI  - Diet and nutritional factors in inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 895-905
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i3.895 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) development is affected by complex interactions 
      between environmental factors, changes in intestinal flora, various predisposing 
      genetic properties and changes in the immune system. Dietary factors seem to play
      an underestimated role in the etiopathogenesis and course of the disease.
      However, research about food and IBD is conflicting. An excessive consumption of 
      sugar, animal fat and linoleic acid is considered a risk factor for IBD
      development, whereas a high fiber diet and citrus fruit consumption may play a
      protective role. Also, appropriate nutrition in particular periods of the disease
      may facilitate achieving or prolonging remissions and most of all, improve the
      quality of life for patients. During disease exacerbation, a low fiber diet is
      recommended for most patients. In the remission time, an excessive consumption of
      alcohol and sulfur products may have a negative effect on the disease course.
      Attempts are also made at employing diets composed in detail in order to
      supplement IBD therapy. A diet with a modified carbohydrate composition, a
      semi-vegetarian diet and a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides,
      disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols are under investigation. Due to
      chronic inflammation as well as side effects of chronically used medications,
      patients with IBD are also at increased risk of nutritional factor deficiencies, 
      including iron, calcium, vitamin D, vitamin B12, folic acid, zinc, magnesium and 
      vitamin A. It should also be remembered that there is no single common diet
      suitable for all IBD patients; each of them is unique and dietary recommendations
      must be individually developed for each patient, depending on the course of the
      disease, past surgical procedures and type of pharmacotherapy.

      Inhibition of Inflammation and Apoptosis.

AB  - This study investigated the preventive effects of vinegar and acetic acid (the
      active component of vinegar) on ulcerative colitis (UC) in mice. Vinegar (5% v/v)
      or acetic acid (0.3% w/v) treatment significantly reduced the disease activity
      index and histopathological scores, attenuated body weight loss, and shortened
      the colon length in a murine experimental colitis model induced by dextran
      sulfate sodium (DSS). Further mechanistic analysis showed that vinegar inhibited 
      inflammation through suppressing Th1 and Th17 responses, the NLRP3 inflammasome, 
      and MAPK signaling activation. Vinegar also inhibited endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 
      stress-mediated apoptosis in the colitis mouse model. Surprisingly, pretreatment 
      with vinegar for 28 days before DSS induction increased levels of the commensal
      lactic acid-producing or acetic acid-producing bacteria, including Lactobacillus,
      Bifidobacteria, and Enterococcus faecalis, whereas decreased Escherichia coli
      levels were found in the feces of mice. These results suggest that vinegar
      supplementation might provide a new dietary strategy for the prevention of UC.

TI  - Therapeutic Potential to Modify the Mucus Barrier in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
LID - 10.3390/nu8010044 [doi]
LID - E44 [pii]
AB  - Recently, numerous studies have shown that disruption of the mucus barrier plays 
      an important role in the exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease, particularly
      in ulcerative colitis. Alterations in the mucus barrier are well supported by
      published data and are widely accepted. The use of fluorescence in situ
      hybridization and Carnoy's fixation has revealed the importance of the mucus
      barrier in maintaining a mutualistic relationship between host and bacteria.
      Studies have raised the possibility that modulation of the mucus barrier may
      provide therapies for the disease, using agents such as short-chain fatty acids, 
      prebiotics and probiotics. This review describes changes in the mucus barrier of 
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease and in animal models of the disease. We 
      also review the involvement of the mucus barrier in the exacerbation of the
      disease and explore the therapeutic potential of modifying the mucus barrier with
      short-chain fatty acids, prebiotics, probiotics, fatty acid synthase, H(2)S,
      neutrophil elastase inhibitor and phophatidyl choline.

TI  - Avoidance of Fiber Is Associated With Greater Risk of Crohn's Disease Flare in a 
      6-Month Period.
PG  - 1130-6
LID - 10.1016/j.cgh.2015.12.029 [doi]
LID - S1542-3565(15)01713-9 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) have been
      associated with an abnormal mucosal response to the gastrointestinal microbiota. 
      Although dietary fiber affects the gastrointestinal microbiota, there is limited 
      information on the role of fiber on IBD activity. We investigated factors
      associated with fiber consumption and whether it was associated with flares in
      patients with IBD. METHODS: We collected a completed 26-item dietary survey from 
      1619 participants in the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America Partners
      Internet cohort (Crohn's disease, 1130; ulcerative colitis/indeterminate colitis,
      489). Eligible individuals were in remission based on disease activity index at
      baseline and completed a follow-up survey 6 months later. Fiber and whole grain
      consumption were categorized into quartiles and deciles. Disease flare at 6
      months was defined as a disease activity index score exceeding remission cutoff
      values, and/or an IBD-related surgical procedure or hospitalization since
      baseline. RESULTS: Participants with longer duration of disease, past history of 
      surgery, and past IBD hospitalization ate less fiber. The risks for disease flare
      differed by disease type. Compared with those in the lowest quartile of fiber
      consumption, participants with Crohn's disease in the highest quartile were less 
      likely to have a flare (adjusted odds ratios [OR], 0.58; 95% confidence interval 
      [CI], 0.37-0.90). Participants with Crohn's disease who reported that they did
      not avoid high-fiber foods were approximately 40% less likely to have a disease
      flare than those who avoided high-fiber foods (adjusted OR, 0.59; 95% CI,
      0.43-0.81). There was no association between fiber intake and flares in patients 
      with ulcerative colitis (adjusted OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 0.92-3.60). CONCLUSIONS:
      Intake of dietary fiber is associated with reduced disease flares in patients
      with Crohn's disease, but not UC. Recommendations to limit dietary fiber should
      be re-evaluated.

TI  - Western diet induces a shift in microbiota composition enhancing susceptibility
      to Adherent-Invasive E. coli infection and intestinal inflammation.
PG  - 19032
LID - 10.1038/srep19032 [doi]
AB  - Recent advances have shown that the abnormal inflammatory response observed in CD
      involves an interplay among intestinal microbiota, host genetics and
      environmental factors. The escalating consumption of fat and sugar in Western
      countries parallels an increased incidence of CD during the latter 20(th)
      century. The impact of a HF/HS diet in mice was evaluated for the gut
      micro-inflammation, intestinal microbiota composition, function and selection of 
      an E. coli population. The HF/HS diet created a specific inflammatory environment
      in the gut, correlated with intestinal mucosa dysbiosis characterized by an
      overgrowth of pro-inflammatory Proteobacteria such as E. coli, a decrease in
      protective bacteria, and a significantly decreased of SCFA concentrations. The
      expression of GPR43, a SCFA receptor was reduced in mice treated with a HF/HS
      diet and reduced in CD patients compared with controls. Interestingly, mice
      treated with an agonist of GPR43 were protected against DSS-induced colitis.
      Finally, the transplantation of feces from HF/HS treated mice to GF mice
      increased susceptibility to AIEC infection. Together, our results demonstrate
      that a Western diet could aggravate the inflammatory process and that the
      activation of the GPR43 receptor pathway could be used as a new strategy to treat
      CD patients.

TI  - Inflammatory Bowel Disease Provoked by Etanercept: Report of 443 Possible Cases
      Combined from an IBD Referral Center and the FDA.
PG  - 1772-4
LID - 10.1007/s10620-015-4007-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anti-TNF therapies have revolutionized the treatment of autoimmune
      inflammatory conditions. Paradoxical treatment with these agents is associated
      with the development of de novo autoimmune diseases. Less well recognized is the 
      provocation of de novo IBD by these agents. Etanercept is not effective for the
      treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and may be more often reported with the
      development of Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. AIM: This study assessed
      the association of new onset IBD in patients with receiving etanercept. METHODS: 
      The Brigham and Women's (BWH) patient database and the FDA Adverse Event
      Reporting System were searched for cases of IBD reported with etanercept.
      RESULTS: A total of 443 cases were identified: 5 pts at BWH (3 CD, 2 UC) and 438 
      (294 CD, 144 UC) reported to the FDA. Data which were most complete were pooled
      from 49 patients. NSAID use was reported in 43 % and combination with
      methotrexate in 29 %. Etanercept was discontinued in 34 pts and 19 required
      treatment with a different anti-TNF agent. Eight patients had resolution of GI
      symptoms on discontinuation of etanercept. Therapy was continued in three
      patients in response to 5-ASA therapy. CONCLUSION: Development of IBD should be
      suspected in patients receiving etanercept who develop GI symptoms. This
      phenomenon appears more commonly associated with initiation of CD. The clinical
      phenotype appears indistinguishable from usual patterns of IBD. Unlike other
      autoimmune phenomenon associated with anti-TNF therapy, IBD often does not
      resolve when the agent is discontinued. This tentative association requires
      further investigation.

TI  - Dietary Patterns and Risk of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Europe: Results from
      the EPIC Study.
PG  - 345-54
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000638 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Specific nutrients or foods have been inconsistently associated with 
      ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) risks. Thus, we investigated
      associations between diet as a whole, as dietary patterns, and UC and CD risks.
      METHODS: Within the prospective EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into
      Cancer) study, we set up a nested matched case-control study among 366,351
      participants with inflammatory bowel disease data, including 256 incident cases
      of UC and 117 of CD, and 4 matched controls per case. Dietary intake was recorded
      at baseline from validated food frequency questionnaires. Incidence rate ratios
      of developing UC and CD were calculated for quintiles of the Mediterranean diet
      score and a posteriori dietary patterns produced by factor analysis. RESULTS: No 
      dietary pattern was associated with either UC or CD risks. However, when
      excluding cases occurring within the first 2 years after dietary assessment,
      there was a positive association between a "high sugar and soft drinks" pattern
      and UC risk (incidence rate ratios for the fifth versus first quintile, 1.68
      [1.00-2.82]; Ptrend = 0.02). When considering the foods most associated with the 
      pattern, high consumers of sugar and soft drinks were at higher UC risk only if
      they had low vegetables intakes. CONCLUSIONS: A diet imbalance with high
      consumption of sugar and soft drinks and low consumption of vegetables was
      associated with UC risk. Further studies are needed to investigate whether
      microbiota alterations or other mechanisms mediate this association.

AB  - Genetic predisposition and environmental factors, including the gut microbiota,
      have been suggested as major factors in the development and progression of atopic
      dermatitis. Hyperlipidemic human APOC1(+/+) transgenic mice display many features
      of human atopic dermatitis, such as scaling, lichenification, excoriations, and
      pruritus, along with a disturbed skin barrier function. Cytokine analysis of
      serum shows an increase of various pro-inflammatory cytokines, including
      interleukin (IL)-12p40, IL-6, and IL-1alpha, but lower levels of
      interferon-gamma. These mice also display aspects of colitis evident from
      macroscopic and histological abnormalities. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis of
      the intestine shows up-regulation of several genes associated with mast cells and
      eosinophils and this observation was confirmed by demonstrating increased numbers
      of IgE(+) and FcRepsilon(+) mast cells in the colon and in the skin. Oral
      treatment with Lactobacillus plantarum NCIMB8826 resulted in decreased numbers of
      mast cells in the colon. Moreover, this L. plantarum strain ameliorated skin
      pathology, evident from improved skin barrier integrity, absence of skin
      thickening, and less excoriations. These results suggest that modulation of
      intestinal immune homeostasis contributes to the suppression of atopic
      dermatitis.

TI  - Mucosal Barrier Depletion and Loss of Bacterial Diversity are Primary
      Abnormalities in Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis.
PG  - 462-71
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv223 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ulcerative colitis [UC] is associated with colonic mucosa
      barrier defects and bacterial dysbiosis, but these features may simply be the
      result of inflammation. Therefore, we sought to assess whether these features are
      inherently abrogated in the terminal ileum [TI] of UC patients, where
      inflammation is absent. METHODS: TI biopsies from paediatric inflammatory bowel
      disease [IBD] subsets [Crohn's disease [CD; n = 13] and UC [n = 10]], and non-IBD
      disease controls [n = 12] were histologically graded, and alcian blue/periodic
      acid-Schiff stained biopsies were quantified. The mucosal barrier was assessed
      for mucin [MUC2], immunoglobulin [Ig]A, IgG, and total bacteria (fluorescence
      in-situ hybridisation [FISH probe EUB338]) by immunofluorescence. The regulation 
      of mucin secretion was investigated by NLRP6 gene expression and
      immunofluorescence. The composition of the active mucosa-associated microbiota
      was explored by sequencing the 16S rRNA amplicon generated from total RNA.
      RESULTS: Despite the absence of ileitis, UC patients displayed ileal barrier
      depletion illustrated by reductions in mucin-containing goblet cells and mucin
      production and altered epithelial NLRP6 expression. In both CD patients with
      ileitis and UC patients with normal histology, bacteria coated with IgA and IgG
      penetrated the TI mucin layer. Biopsy 16S rRNA sequencing revealed a reduction in
      alpha-diversity by three methods [Shannon, Simpson, and Equitability indices]
      between UC and non-IBD paediatric patients. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest
      an underlying defect in the UC-afflicted intestinal tract even in the absence of 
      inflammation, implicating barrier and microbial changes as primary abnormalities 
      in UC that may play a causative role in disease development.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Despite dietary factors being implicated in the pathogenesis of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), nutritional therapy, outside of exclusive
      enteral nutrition (EEN), has not had a defined role within the treatment paradigm
      of pediatric IBD within IBD centers. Based on emerging data, Seattle Children's
      Hospital IBD Center has developed an integrated dietary program incorporating the
      specific carbohydrate diet (SCD) into its treatment paradigm. This treatment
      paradigm uses the SCD as primary therapy as well as adjunctive therapy for the
      treatment of IBD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential effects of 
      the SCD on clinical outcomes and laboratory studies of pediatric patients with
      Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: In this retrospective 
      study, we reviewed the medical records of patients with IBD on SCD. RESULTS: We
      analyzed 26 children on the SCD: 20 with CD and 6 with UC. Duration of the
      dietary therapy ranged from 3 to 48 mo. In patients with active CD (Pediatric
      Crohn's Disease activity index [PCDAI] >10), PCDAI dropped from 32.8 +/- 13.2 at 
      baseline to 20.8 +/- 16.6 by 4 +/- 2 wk, and to 8.8 +/- 8.5 by 6 mo. The mean
      Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index for patients with active UC decreased
      from a baseline of 28.3 +/- 10.3 to 20.0 +/- 17.3 at 4 +/- 2 wk, to 18.3 +/- 31.7
      at 6 mo. CONCLUSION: This retrospective review provides evidence that the SCD can
      be integrated into a tertiary care center and may improve clinical and laboratory
      parameters for pediatric patients with nonstructuring, nonpenetrating CD as well 
      as UC. Further prospective studies are needed to fully assess the safety and
      efficacy of the SCD in pediatric patients with IBD.

      remission and relapse in murine chronic colitis.

LID - 10.3920/bm2015.0037 [doi]
AB  - Although interest in using probiotics to prevent and treat intestinal diseases is
      increasing, the effects of specific probiotic strains still remain unclear. Here,
      we assess the therapeutic effects of two probiotic strains, Lactobacillus
      rhamnosus NutRes 1 and Bifidobacterium breve NutRes 204 on a dextran sodium
      sulphate (DSS)-induced chronic murine colitis model. The chronic colitis was
      induced by two DSS treatment cycles with a rest period of 10 days (the remission 
      or resolution phase). The probiotic supplementation was started during the
      resolution phase, after the first DSS treatment cycle, and continued until the
      end of the experiment. In addition to clinical observations made during the
      experiment, cellular infiltration was measured along with mRNA expression of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, T cell-associated cytokines, and Toll like receptors 
      (TLR) in the inflamed colon after second DSS treatment cycle. L. rhamnosus, but
      not B. breve, rapidly and effectively improved the DSS-induced bloody diarrhoea
      during the resolution phase. However, a contradictory effect by both probiotic
      strains on the faecal condition was found after re-induction of colitis. The
      worsening of the faecal condition was accompanied by a reduced number of
      neutrophils and increased expression of interferon-gamma in the colons of
      DSS-treated mice. Furthermore, an increased expression of TLR2, TLR6 and
      pro-inflammatory markers including chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2, interleukin
      (IL)-1beta, tumour necrosis factor alpha and IL-6 was found in DSS-treated mice
      with L. rhamnosus supplementation. These results indicate that therapeutic
      administration of specific probiotics might be beneficial during the resolution
      phase of colitis. However, caution should be taken as specific probiotic
      treatments reduce neutrophil influx, which may be the reason of exacerbation of
      chronic colitis.

AB  - Clostridium difficile is being recognized as a growing threat to many health-care
      systems. Epidemiology data shows that infection rates are soaring and the disease
      burden is increasing. Despite the efficacy of standard treatments, it is becoming
      evident that novel therapeutics will be required to tackle this disease. These
      new treatments aim to enhance the intestinal microbial barrier, activate the
      immune system and neutralize the toxins that mediate this disease. Many of these 
      therapies are still in the beginning stages of investigation, however, in the
      next few years, more clinical data will become available to help implement many
      of these exciting new therapeutic approaches.

AB  - This study was carried out to investigate the anti-inflammatory potentials of a
      38 kDa glycoprotein isolated from Styrax japonica Siebold et al Zuccarini (SJSZ
      glycoprotein). We found that SJSZ glycoprotein has concentration-dependent
      scavenging activity against DPPH and hydroxyl radicals in the cell-free systems. 
      In colonic epithelial cells (HCT116 cells), the results showed that SJSZ
      glycoprotein inhibits the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by 
      glucose/glucose oxidase (G/GO) in a concentration-dependent manner. Experimental 
      mouse colitis was induced by adding dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to the drinking 
      water at a concentration of 4% (w/v) for 7 days. We figured out that
      administration of SJSZ glycoprotein (10 mg/kg) lowers the levels of disease
      activity index, myeloperoxidase activity, and histological inflammation in
      DSS-treated mice. In addition, SJSZ glycoprotein inhibited plasmic thiobarbituric
      acid reactive substances (TBARS) formation, nitric oxide (NO) production, and
      lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, accompanying the inhibition of colonic
      inflammatory signal proteins (NF-kappaB, iNOS, and COX-2) and
      inflammation-related cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha). These results
      indicate that SJSZ glycoprotein inhibits oxidative and pro-inflammatory responses
      in mouse colitis.

AB  - Dairy propionibacteria (PAB) are used as a ripening starter in combination with
      Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) for dairy products such as Swiss-type cheese. LAB and 
      PAB have also been studied for their probiotic properties but little is still
      known about their individual and/or synergistic beneficial effects within dairy
      matrices. In the context of a rising incidence of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, it
      has become crucial to evaluate the immunomodulatory potential of bacteria
      ingested in large numbers via dairy products. We therefore selected different
      strains and combinations of technological LAB and PAB. We determined their
      immunomodulatory potential by IL-10 and IL-12 induction, in human peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells, on either single or mixed cultures, grown on laboratory 
      medium or directly in milk. Milk was fermented with selected anti-inflammatory
      strains of LAB or PAB/LAB mixed cultures and the resulting bacterial fractions
      were also evaluated for these properties, together with starter viability and
      optimum technological aspects. The most promising fermented milks were evaluated 
      in the context of TNBS- or DSS-induced colitis in mice. The improvement in
      inflammatory parameters evidenced an alleviation of colitis symptoms as a result 
      of fermented milk consumption. This effect was clearly strain-dependent and
      modulated by growth within a fermented dairy product. These findings offer new
      tools and perspectives for the development of immunomodulatory fermented dairy
      products for targeted populations.

AB  - Chronic diarrhoea is a common presenting symptom in both primary care medicine
      and in specialized gastroenterology clinics. It is estimated that >5% of the
      population has chronic diarrhoea and nearly 40% of these patients are older than 
      60 years. Clinicians often need to select the best diagnostic approach to these
      patients and choose between the multiple diagnostic tests available. In 2014 the 
      Catalan Society of Gastroenterology formed a working group with the main
      objective of creating diagnostic algorithms based on clinical practice and to
      evaluate diagnostic tests and the scientific evidence available for their use.
      The GRADE system was used to classify scientific evidence and strength of
      recommendations. The consensus document contains 28 recommendations and 6
      diagnostic algorithms. The document also describes criteria for referral from
      primary to specialized care.

TI  - Identification of key active constituents of Buchang Naoxintong capsules with
      therapeutic effects against ischemic stroke by using an integrative
      pharmacology-based approach.
PG  - 233-45
LID - 10.1039/c5mb00460h [doi]
AB  - Integrative pharmacology has been used to identify the key active constituents
      (KACs) of Buchang Naoxintong capsules (BNCs), a traditional Chinese medical
      preparation; this approach involves the evaluation of the content profiles and
      drug-like properties of the BNC constituents and development of an
      ingredient-target network. In this study, we used a sensitive analytical method
      to simultaneously identify and quantify 16 constituents of BNCs. Metabolism of
      these constituents by gut microbiota and human oral bioavailability were
      predicted using an in silico approach, followed by construction of networks to
      analyze the interactions between BNC constituents, their molecular targets, and
      proteins known to be the molecular targets for Food and Drug
      Administration-approved colitis medication. Finally, an animal model of ischemic 
      stroke was used to verify the therapeutic effects of the KACs of BNCs. Amygdalin 
      and paeoniflorin were identified as the KACs because they were the 2 most
      abundant BNC constituents, having appropriate drug-like properties, and produced 
      therapeutic effects against cerebral ischemia. Amygdalin produced an
      anti-cerebral ischemia effect, likely by interacting with the glucocorticoid
      receptor (NR3C1) and serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade C (antithrombin), member 1
      (SERPINC1). These results form the basis for conducting studies to identify KACs 
      in traditional medicinal preparations; such studies might improve quality control
      and allow the in vivo evaluation of synergistic interactions between the complex 
      mixtures of compounds.

TI  - Inflammation Controls Sensitivity of Human and Mouse Intestinal Epithelial Cells 
      to Galectin-1.
PG  - 1575-85
LID - 10.1002/jcp.25249 [doi]
AB  - Galectins play key roles in the inflammatory cascade. In this study, we aimed to 
      analyze the effect of galectin-1 (Gal-1) in the function of intestinal epithelial
      cells (IECs) isolated from healthy and inflamed mucosa. IECs isolated from mice
      or patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) were incubated with different 
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, and Gal-1 binding, secretion of homeostatic factors
      and viability were assessed. Experimental models of food allergy and colitis were
      used to evaluate the in vivo influence of inflammation on Gal-1 binding and
      modulation of IECs. We found an enhanced binding of Gal-1 to: (a) murine IECs
      exposed to IL-1beta, TNF, and IL-13; (b) IECs from inflamed areas in intestinal
      tissue from IBD patients; (c) small bowel of allergic mice; and (d) colon from
      mice with experimental colitis. Our results showed that low concentrations of
      Gal-1 favored a tolerogenic micro-environment, whereas high concentrations of
      this lectin modulated viability of IECs through mechanisms involving activation
      of caspase-9 and modulation of Bcl-2 protein family members. Our results showed
      that, when added in the presence of diverse pro-inflammatory cytokines such as
      tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-13 and IL-5, Gal-1 differentially promoted the
      secretion of growth factors including thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP),
      epidermal growth factor (EGF), IL-10, IL-25, and transforming growth factor
      (TGF-beta1 ). In conclusion, we found an augmented binding of Gal-1 to IECs when 
      exposed in vitro or in vivo to inflammatory stimuli, showing different effects
      depending on Gal-1 concentration. These findings highlight the importance of the 
      inflammatory micro-environment of mucosal tissues in modulating IECs
      susceptibility to the immunoregulatory lectin Gal-1 and its role in epithelial
      cell homeostasis.

TI  - Probiotic yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus CIDCA 8154 shows anti-inflammatory and
      anti-oxidative stress properties in in vivo models.
PG  - 83-93
LID - 10.3920/BM2015.0066 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are complex affections with increasing
      incidence worldwide. Multiple factors are involved in the development and
      maintenance of the symptoms including enhanced oxidative stress in intestinal
      mucosa. The conventional therapeutic approaches for IBDs are based on the use
      anti-inflammatory drugs with important collateral effects and partial efficacy.
      In the present work we tested the anti-inflammatory capacity of Kluyveromyces
      marxianus CIDCA 8154 in different models. In vitro, we showed that the
      pretreatment of epithelial cells with the yeast reduce the levels of
      intracellular reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, in a murine model of trinitro
      benzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis, yeast-treated animals showed a reduced
      histopathological score (P<0.05) and lower levels of circulating interleukin 6
      (P<0.05). The capacity to modulate oxidative stress in vivo was assessed using a 
      Caenorhabditis elegans model. The yeast was able to protect the nematodes from
      oxidative stress by modulating the SKN-1 transcription factor trough the DAF-2
      pathway. These results indicate that K. marxianus CIDCA 8154 could control the
      intestinal inflammation and cellular oxidative stress. Deciphering the mechanisms
      of action of different probiotics might be useful for the rational formulation of
      polymicrobial products containing microorganisms targeting different
      anti-inflammatory pathways.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease
      are chronic relapsing and remitting chronic diseases for which there is no cure. 
      The treatment of IBD frequently requires immunosuppressive and biologic therapies
      which carry an increased risk of infections and possible malignancy. There is a
      continued search for safer and more natural therapies in the treatment of IBD.
      This review aims to summarize the most current literature on the use of dietary
      supplements for the treatment of IBD. Specifically, the efficacy and adverse
      effects of vitamin D, fish oil, probiotics, prebiotics, curcumin, Boswellia
      serrata, aloe vera and cannabis sativa are reviewed.

AB  - Oral bioavailability studies during the development of new medical entities or
      generic drugs are typically performed in healthy volunteers. Approved drug
      products are, however, used by patients with diverse disease backgrounds, and by 
      pediatric and elderly patients. To provide the knowledge base for assessing the
      potential effects of age or co-morbidity on the in vivo performance of an orally 
      absorbed, systemically active drug product, the literature regarding the
      gastrointestinal (GI) physiological characteristics (pH, permeability, and
      transit time) in children, in the elderly, and in patients with GI diseases
      (irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease) is reviewed
      herein, with the knowledge gaps highlighted.

TI  - Interleukin-6 stimulates aerobic glycolysis by regulating PFKFB3 at early stage
      of colorectal cancer.
PG  - 215-24
LID - 10.3892/ijo.2015.3225 [doi]
AB  - Chronic inflammation is a well-known etiological factor for colorectal cancer
      (CRC) and cancer cells are known to preferentially metabolize glucose through
      aerobic glycolysis. However, the connection between chronic inflammation and
      aerobic glycolysis in the development of CRC is largely unexplored. The present
      study investigated whether interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pro-inflammatory cytokine,
      promotes the development of CRC by regulating the aerobic glycolysis and the
      underlying molecular mechanisms. In colitis-associated CRC mouse, anti-IL-6
      receptor antibody treatment reduced the incidence of CRC and decreased the
      expression of key genes in aerobic glycolysis, whereas the plasma concentrations 
      of glucose and lactate were not affected. Consistently, IL-6 treatment stimulated
      aerobic glycolysis, upregulated key genes in aerobic glycolysis and promoted cell
      proliferation and migration in SW480 and SW1116 CRC cells.
      6-phoshofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase-3 (PFKFB3) was the most
      downregulated gene by anti-IL-6 receptor antibody in colorectal adenoma tissues. 
      Further analysis in human samples revealed overexpression of PFKFB3 in colorectal
      adenoma and adenocarcinoma tissues, which was also associated with lymph node
      metastasis, intravascular cancer embolus and TNM stage. In addition, the effect
      of IL-6 on CRC cells can be abolished by knocking down PRKFB3 through siRNA
      transfection. Our data suggest that chronic inflammation promotes the development
      of CRC by stimulating aerobic glycolysis and IL-6 is functioning, at least
      partly, through regulating PFKFB3 at early stage of CRC.

TI  - Review article: insights into colonic protein fermentation, its modulation and
      potential health implications.
PG  - 181-96
LID - 10.1111/apt.13456 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Beneficial effects of carbohydrate fermentation on gastrointestinal
      health are well established. Conversely, protein fermentation generates harmful
      metabolites but their relevance to gastrointestinal health is poorly understood. 
      AIM: To review the effects of increased protein fermentation on biomarkers of
      colonic health, factors influencing fermentative activity and potential for
      dietary modulation to minimise detrimental effects. METHODS: A literature search 
      was performed in PubMed, Medline, EMBASE and Google scholar for clinical and
      pre-clinical studies using search terms - 'dietary protein', 'fermentation',
      'putrefaction', 'phenols', 'sulphide', 'branched-chain fatty acid', 'carbohydrate
      fermentation', 'gastrointestinal'. RESULTS: High protein, reduced carbohydrate
      diets alter the colonic microbiome, favouring a potentially pathogenic and
      pro-inflammatory microbiota profile, decreased short-chain fatty acid production 
      and increased ammonia, phenols and hydrogen sulphide concentrations. These
      metabolites largely compromise the colonic epithelium structure, causing mucosal 
      inflammation but may also directly modulate the enteric nervous system and
      intestinal motility. Increased protein fermentation as a result of a high-protein
      intake can be attenuated by addition of oligosaccharides, resistant starch and
      nonstarch polysaccharides and a reduction in total protein or specifically,
      aromatic and sulphur-containing amino acids. These factors may have clinical
      importance as novel therapeutic approaches to problems, in which protein
      fermentation may be implicated, such as malodorous flatus, irritable bowel
      syndrome, ulcerative colitis and prevention of colorectal cancer. CONCLUSIONS:
      The direct clinical relevance of excessive protein fermentation in the
      pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome, malodorous flatus and ulcerative
      colitis are underexplored. Manipulating dietary carbohydrate and protein intake
      have potential therapeutic applications in such settings and warrant further
      clinical studies.

TI  - The effect of Clostridium butyricum MIYAIRI on the prevention of pouchitis and
      alteration of the microbiota profile in patients with ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 939-49
LID - 10.1007/s00595-015-1261-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, relapsing, and refractory disorder
      of the intestine. Total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) 
      is the preferred and standard surgical procedure for patients' refractory to
      medical therapy. Pouchitis is one of the most common long-term complications
      after IPAA. In the present study, the safety and efficacy of Clostridium
      butyricum MIYAIRI (CBM) as a probiotic were examined. METHODS: A randomized and
      placebo-controlled study was performed. Seventeen patients were recruited from
      2007 to 2013. Nine tablets of MIYA-BM((R)) or placebo were orally administered
      once daily. The cumulative pouchitis-free survival, pouch condition (using the
      modified pouch disease activity index), and blood parameters were evaluated. A
      fecal sample analysis was also performed. RESULTS: Subjects were randomly
      allocated to receive MIYA-BM or placebo (9 and 8 subjects, respectively). One
      subject in the MIYA-BM group and four subjects in the placebo group developed
      pouchitis. No side effects occurred in either group. Characteristic intestinal
      flora was observed in each group. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that probiotic
      therapy with CBM achieved favorable results with minimal side effects and might
      be a useful complementary therapy for the prevention of pouchitis in patients
      with UC who have undergone IPAA.

TI  - Food-related Quality of Life in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Development and
      Validation of a Questionnaire.
PG  - 194-201
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv192 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Psychosocial factors surrounding eating and drinking, such as
      enjoying food, managing restrictions, and maintaining social relationships,
      remain under-researched in inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]. This study aimed to 
      develop and validate a food-related quality of life [FR-QoL] questionnaire to
      systematically measure these issues in the IBD population. METHODS: Following
      semi-structured interviews with 28 IBD patients, 150 potential questionnaire
      items were generated. These were ranked by 100 IBD patients, and items were
      removed based on ceiling/floor effects and high inter-item correlations [> 0.7], 
      with 41 items being retained. In total, 323 IBD patients, 100 asthma patients
      [chronic disease control], and 117 healthy controls completed the FR-QoL
      questionnaire, alongside generic and disease-specific QoL and food satisfaction
      questionnaires. Principal components analysis [PCA], construct and discriminant
      validity, and test-retest reliability were calculated. RESULTS: Twelve items were
      removed following PCA. The reduced questionnaire [FR-QoL-29] explained 63.9% of
      the variance [Cronbach's alpha = 0.96]. FR-QoL-29 correlated significantly with
      generic QoL [r = 0.697], depression [r = -0.519], anxiety [r = -0.531], and food 
      satisfaction [r = 0.701]. The FR-QoL-29 sumscores were significantly lower for
      IBD (89.5, standard deviation [SD] 28.6) than asthma [125.4, SD 24.1; p < 0.001] 
      and healthy volunteers [123.0, SD 16.5; p<0.001]. Within IBD, worse food-related 
      QoL was found in those with moderate/high disease activity [66.7, SD 22.1]
      compared with remission/low disease activity [92.5, SD 28.1]. Test-retest
      reliability was good (intra-class correlation [ICC] = 0.83, 95% confidence
      interval [CI] = 0.76:0.88). CONCLUSIONS: The FR-QoL-29 shows good reliability and
      validity across a range of IBD characteristics. This easily administered
      questionnaire is a useful tool in identifying poor food-related QoL and in the
      future may identify areas for intervention.

TI  - Identification of novel anti-inflammatory probiotic strains isolated from pulque.
PG  - 385-396
AB  - Probiotics are live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts,
      confer health benefits on the host. Their use is more and more widespread for
      both prevention and treatment of diseases, including traveler's diarrhea and
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). In this work, we isolated and characterized
      novel candidate probiotic strains from pulque (xaxtle), a traditional Mexican
      alcoholic fermented beverage. A total of 14 strains were obtained from xaxtle
      samples isolated from three different Mexican regions. Species identification was
      performed by biochemical methods and 16S rRNA gene targeted PCR. The isolates
      belonged to the Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus
      brevis, and Lactobacillus composti phylogenetic groups, with L. brevis being the 
      most dominant group. Bacteria were tested for lysozyme, low pH, and bile acid
      resistance. Moreover, the strains were tested for adherence to human intestinal
      epithelial cells and screened for their immunomodulatory properties using a
      cellular model. Selected bacterial strains with anti-inflammatory properties were
      then tested in vivo in a dinitro-benzene sulfonic acid (DNBS)-induced chronic
      colitis mouse model, and weight loss, gut permeability, and cytokine profiles
      were measured as readouts of inflammation. One of the selected strains,
      Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis LBH1068, improved mice health as observed by a
      reduction of weight loss, significant decreases in gut permeability, and cytokine
      modulation. Altogether, our results highlighted the potential of lactobacilli
      isolated from pulque and in particular the strain L. sanfranciscensis LBH1068 as 
      a novel probiotic to treat IBD.

AB  - Microscopic colitis is a common cause of chronic diarrhea. It is characterized by
      non-bloody watery diarrhea with macroscopically normal colonic mucosa. Its
      specific histological characteristics confirm the diagnosis. Two distinct
      histological forms can be identified, namely, collagenous colitis and lymphocytic
      colitis. In collagenous colitis, a thick colonic subepithelial collagenous
      deposit can be observed, whereas in lymphocytic colitis, a pronounced
      intraepithelial lymphocytic inflammation in the absence of a thickened collagen
      band can be identified. Microscopic colitis occurs more frequently in elderly
      females and its etiology is believed to be multifactorial, although smoking and
      consumption of several drugs have been identified as risks factors for the
      development of the disease. The treatment is based on avoiding the risks factors 
      and administration of oral budesonide.

      placebo-controlled multicenter trial.
PG  - 67-74
LID - 10.1111/den.12553 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: We conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled
      trial to investigate the efficacy of Bifidobacterium longum 536 (BB536)
      supplementation for induction of remission in Japanese patients with active
      ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Fifty-six patients with mild to moderate UC
      were enrolled. Three patients had pancolitis, 36 had left-sided colitis, and 17
      had proctitis. Patients were randomly treated with 2-3 x 10(11) freeze-dried
      viable BB536 (28 patients) or placebo (28 patients) for 8 weeks. RESULTS: In
      total, 63% of patients receiving BB536 showed clinical remission (UC disease
      activity index [UCDAI] </=2) at week 8 compared to 52% of those receiving placebo
      (P = 0.395). We observed a significant decrease of UCDAI scores (3.8 +/- 0.4 at
      baseline to 2.6 +/- 0.4 at week 8) in the BB536 group (P < 0.01), whereas there
      was no significant decrease in the placebo group (P = 0.88). There was also a
      significant decrease in the Rachmilewitz endoscopic index (EI) and the Mayo
      subscore at week 8 in the BB536 group, whereas there was no significant decrease 
      in the placebo group. A single patient in the BB536 group complained of a mild
      side-effect, but no other adverse effects were observed. CONCLUSION:
      Supplementation with BB536 was well tolerated and reduced UCDAI scores, EI and
      Mayo subscores after 8 weeks in Japanese patients with mild to moderately active 
      UC.

TI  - Toxic epidermal necrolysis caused by acetaminophen featuring almost 100% skin

      reactions.
PG  - 321-4
LID - 10.1111/1346-8138.13073 [doi]
AB  - Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is an adverse reaction that can be induced by
      various drugs; the associated mortality rate is 20-25%. A previous report showed 
      a weak association between TEN and acetaminophen. Recently, the US Food and Drug 
      Administration declared that acetaminophen is associated with a risk of serious
      skin reactions, including TEN. Here, we describe the case of a 43-year-old
      Japanese woman with TEN caused by acetaminophen. She had poorly controlled
      ulcerative colitis and was treated with high doses of prednisolone, infliximab,
      acetaminophen and lansoprazole. Nine days after administrating acetaminophen,
      targetoid erythematous and bullous lesions appeared on the patient's trunk, palms
      and the soles of her feet. The skin lesions expanded rapidly; within 3 weeks,
      skin detachment was detected across nearly 100% of the patient's body. However,
      no mucosal involvement of the eyes, oral cavity or genitalia was found. We
      performed lymphocyte transformation tests using various drugs; however, a high
      stimulation index was obtained only with acetaminophen. The patient recovered
      following treatment with plasmapheresis, i.v. immunoglobulin therapy, topical
      medication and supportive therapy. Acetaminophen is included in many prescription
      and over-the-counter products; thus, clinicians should monitor their patients for
      severe drug reactions, including TEN.

TI  - The gut microbiota and host health: a new clinical frontier.
PG  - 330-9
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2015-309990 [doi]
AB  - Over the last 10-15 years, our understanding of the composition and functions of 
      the human gut microbiota has increased exponentially. To a large extent, this has
      been due to new 'omic' technologies that have facilitated large-scale analysis of
      the genetic and metabolic profile of this microbial community, revealing it to be
      comparable in influence to a new organ in the body and offering the possibility
      of a new route for therapeutic intervention. Moreover, it might be more accurate 
      to think of it like an immune system: a collection of cells that work in unison
      with the host and that can promote health but sometimes initiate disease. This
      review gives an update on the current knowledge in the area of gut disorders, in 
      particular metabolic syndrome and obesity-related disease, liver disease, IBD and
      colorectal cancer. The potential of manipulating the gut microbiota in these
      disorders is assessed, with an examination of the latest and most relevant
      evidence relating to antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, polyphenols and faecal 
      microbiota transplantation.

AB  - Human skin is the first defense barrier against the external environment,
      especially microbial pathogens and physical stimulation. Many studies on skin
      health with Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have been published for many years,
      including prevention of skin disease and improvement of skin conditions. LAB, a
      major group of gram-positive bacteria, are known to be beneficial to human health
      by acting as probiotics. Recent studies have shown that LAB and their extracts
      have beneficial effects on maintenance and improvement of skin health. Oral
      administration of Lactobacillus delbrueckii inhibits the development of atopic
      disease. In addition, LAB and LAB extracts are known to have beneficial effects
      on intestinal diseases, with Lactobacillus plantarum having been shown to
      attenuate IL-10 deficient colitis. In addition to intestinal health, L. plantarum
      also has beneficial effects on skin. pLTA, which is lipoteichoic acid isolated
      from L. plantarum, has anti-photoaging effects on human skin cells by regulating 
      the expression matrix meralloprotionase-1 (MMP-1) expression. While several
      studies have proposed a relationship between diseases of the skin and small
      intestines, there are currently no published reviews of the effects of LAB for
      skin health through regulation of intestinal conditions and the immune system. In
      this review, we discuss recent findings on the effects of LAB on skin health and 
      its potential applications in beauty foods.

TI  - Identification of an anti-inflammatory protein from Faecalibacterium prausnitzii,
      a commensal bacterium deficient in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 415-425
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2014-307649 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD)-associated dysbiosis is characterised by a loss 
      of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, whose culture supernatant exerts an
      anti-inflammatory effect both in vitro and in vivo. However, the chemical nature 
      of the anti-inflammatory compounds has not yet been determined. METHODS:
      Peptidomic analysis using mass spectrometry was applied to F. prausnitzii
      supernatant. Anti-inflammatory effects of identified peptides were tested in
      vitro directly on intestinal epithelial cell lines and on cell lines transfected 
      with a plasmid construction coding for the candidate protein encompassing these
      peptides. In vivo, the cDNA of the candidate protein was delivered to the gut by 
      recombinant lactic acid bacteria to prevent dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid
      (DNBS)-colitis in mice. RESULTS: The seven peptides, identified in the F.
      prausnitzii culture supernatants, derived from a single microbial
      anti-inflammatory molecule (MAM), a protein of 15 kDa, and comprising 53% of
      non-polar residues. This last feature prevented the direct characterisation of
      the putative anti-inflammatory activity of MAM-derived peptides. Transfection of 
      MAM cDNA in epithelial cells led to a significant decrease in the activation of
      the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB pathway with a dose-dependent effect. Finally, the
      use of a food-grade bacterium, Lactococcus lactis, delivering a plasmid encoding 
      MAM was able to alleviate DNBS-induced colitis in mice. CONCLUSIONS: A 15 kDa
      protein with anti-inflammatory properties is produced by F. prausnitzii, a
      commensal bacterium involved in CD pathogenesis. This protein is able to inhibit 
      the NF-kappaB pathway in intestinal epithelial cells and to prevent colitis in an
      animal model.

AB  - Diet may be a successful part of the treatment plan for improving outcome in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study aimed to
      systematically review all published clinical trials evaluating the effects of a
      regular diet on symptoms of IBD. Three medical databases were searched for
      clinical trials evaluating an intervention that involved dietary manipulation
      using a regular diet on adults with IBD whose symptoms were objectively measured 
      before and after the intervention. The most common types of regular diet
      interventions that we observed in the literature fell into the following three
      categories: low residue/low fiber diets, exclusion diets, or other specific
      diets. Of all included studies, the few that were of higher quality and that
      observed a statistically significant improvement in symptoms in the diet group
      compared to the control group fell under the exclusion diet group or the other
      specific diet group. We were able to identify several high quality clinical
      trials evaluating dietary manipulations on symptoms of IBD. Exclusion diets and
      the low FODMAP diet are two areas identified in this review that show promise for
      having therapeutic benefits for patients with IBD.

TI  - Escherichia coli O157: Insights into the adaptive stress physiology and the
      influence of stressors on epidemiology and ecology of this human pathogen.

AB  - Escherichia coli O157, a foodborne pathogen of major concern for public health,
      has been associated with numerous outbreaks of haemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic
      uremic syndrome worldwide. Human infection with E. coli O157 has been primarily
      associated with the food-chain transmission route. This transmission route
      commonly elicits a multi-faceted adaptive stress response of E. coli O157 for an 
      extended period of time prior to human infection. Several recent research
      articles have indicated that E. coli O157:H7 has evolved unique survival
      characteristics which can affect the epidemiology and ecology of this zoonotic
      pathogen. This review article summarizes the recent knowledge of the molecular
      responses of E. coli O157 to the most common stressors found within the human
      food chain, and further emphasizes the influence of these stressors on the
      epidemiology and ecology of E. coli O157.
