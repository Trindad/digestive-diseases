TI  - Dietary carbohydrates and the colonic microflora.
PG  - 409-14
AB  - The world of the colonic microflora has lain dormant in recent years, but is
      coming alive now with the advent of new chemical and molecular technologies for
      identifying bacteria, and the emergence of the concepts of biofilms, pro- and
      prebiotics. That bacteria play an essential role in barrier resistance to
      infection, ulcerative colitis and colorectal cancer is slowly becoming clear. New
      potential therapeutic avenues using bacteria should soon start to open up.
      Scientifically we lack an understanding of the mechanisms at work.

TI  - Verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli O157: public health and microbiological 
      significance.
PG  - 127-35
AB  - Escherichia coli O157 was recognised as a human pathogen in the late 1970s, its
      public health significance being recognised in 1982 when it was implicated in a
      large outbreak of infection associated with a fast-food restaurant in North
      America. Incidence of infection in the population is relatively low compared to
      other enteric pathogens; however, this organism causes a spectrum of disease
      increasing in severity from a mild diarrhoeal illness to haemorrhagic colitis,
      haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) and, in some cases, death. Production of
      verocytotoxin and intimin, and the presence of a 60 mDa plasmid are thought to be
      important virulence factors; however, many currently unidentified factors may
      also contribute. The infectious dose of this organism is low and reports of
      food-borne, water-borne and person-to-person transmission have occurred,
      including several laboratory-acquired infections. Techniques for isolation,
      identification and confirmation of these organisms, based on cultural,
      immunological and molecular detection, are described. Additionally, schemes have 
      been developed to type these organisms for epidemiological investigation, and the
      roles of phage typing and genotyping are discussed. These enable identification
      of sources and the introduction of intervention strategies for prevention of
      spread in the community.

TI  - Human diseases caused by exotoxins produced by anaerobes and their rapid
      detection.
PG  - 97-104
AB  - Major human diseases caused by exotoxins produced by anaerobes include botulisms,
      tetanus, foodborne illness caused by enterotoxin-producing Clostridium
      perfringens, and diarrhea/colitis caused by toxigenic Clostridium difficile.
      Recently, enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) has been recognized, that
      may be related to childhood diarrheal disease. Detection test of botulinal
      neurotoxin is hardly performed at clinical laboratories since the most reliable
      means of detection and identification of botulinal toxin is by using mouse
      toxicity and neutralization tests. Clinical laboratories should request the tests
      to a reference laboratory. Since tetanus is easily diagnosed clinically on the
      basis of its unique, recognizable sings, the bacteriological tests is not usually
      requested. C. perfringens foodborne illness can be confirmed by testing stool
      specimens or the suspect food(s) for enterotoxin by the reversed passive latex
      agglutination test or counting > 10 5 C. perfringens per g of suspected food or >
      10 6 C. perfringens spores per g of stool. Diagnosis of C. difficile-associated
      diarrhea/colitis is confirmed by detection of toxins A or B of C. difficile
      and/or recovery of toxigenic C. difficile. Isolation of C. difficile strains or
      detection C. difficile-speciffic antigen from stool specimens is less diagnostic 
      since nontoxic or toxin A positive-toxin B negative strains are prevalent in
      Japan. Reliable laboratory tests for ETBF-associated childhood diarrhea are not
      established yet although ETBF can be proved by polymerase chain reaction for
      detection of the enterotoxin gene.

AB  - The presence of virulence genes, encoding enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli
      (EHEC)-hemolysin (EHEC-hlyA), intimin (eae), and Shiga toxins 1 (stx1) and 2
      (stx2), in 178 isolates of pathogenic E. coli, was determined using the
      polymerase chain reaction with primers specific for each virulence gene. The
      tested organisms were 120 isolates of E. coli O157:H7 from human patients,
      cattle, sheep and foods, 16 non-O157:H7 EHEC isolates from patients suffering
      from hemorrhagic colitis or hemolytic uremic syndrome, 15 non-O157:H7 Shiga
      toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) isolates from cattle and foods, 26 isolates of
      enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) and
      enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), and an E. coli K12 strain. Results revealed that 
      all isolates of O157:H7 carried EHEC-hlyA, eae, and one or both stx genes; 15 of 
      the 16 non-O157:H7 EHEC isolates had EHEC-hlyA, but all possessed eae and one or 
      both stx genes; only seven of the 15 non-O157 STEC isolated from cattle and foods
      contained both EHEC-hlyA and eae genes. The EPEC, EIEC, ETEC, and the E. coli K12
      strain did not carry these virulence genes, except eight EPEC isolates were
      positive for eae. Results suggest that a combination of EHEC-hlyA and eae genes
      could serve as markers to differentiate EHEC from less pathogenic STEC, and other
      pathogenic or non-pathogenic E. coli.

TI  - Patients' diets and preferences in a pediatric population with inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 544-9
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the dietary practices of the pediatric inflammatory bowel
      disease population at the Children's Hospital of the Hamilton Health Sciences
      Corporation and the reported effectiveness of those diets. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      A questionnaire mailed to 153 pediatric patients was returned by 125 patients (76
      Crohn's disease [CD] and 49 ulcerative colitis [UC] patients)--an 82% response
      rate. RESULTS: The median age of respondents was 13 years, and 62% were male.
      Ninety per cent and 71% of CD and UC patients, respectively, had changed their
      diets since diagnosis. Caloric supplements (eg, BOOST [Mead Johnson
      Nutritionals]), sole source nutrition, low fibre and lactose-free diets were used
      by more than 15% of CD patients, whereas lactose-free, nonspicy, low acid,
      additive-free, caloric supplement and low fibre diets were used by more than 15% 
      of UC patients. A diet supplement was more commonly used in CD patients (P <
      0.05) and an additive-free diet in UC patients. Corn and corn products, nuts,
      milk and bran were avoided by more than 20% of CD and UC patients; however, more 
      CD than UC patients avoided corn and corn products. In addition, UC patients
      (more than 20%) also avoided tomato, other dairy (nonfluid milk-based products
      and foods containing milk products), chocolate, cheese, wheat, tomato sauces and 
      fruit juice. A benefit was reported for 103 of 141 reported diets, with the most 
      commonly alleviated symptoms being abdominal pain, diarrhea and flatulence.
      CONCLUSION: Many children with inflammatory bowel disease have altered their
      diets to manage their disease and have attributed symptomatic relief to these
      diets.

AB  - The collection of 100 Escherichia coli strains isolated in clinical samples (30),
      healthy carriers (30) and seafood (40), was characterized by conventional tests
      on API 20 E gallery and on specific reactive media. These strains were examined
      by full biotyping with 10 tests, serotyped using 12 monovalent sera and tested
      with 11 antibiotics. Six persons harboured higher percentages of resistant E.
      coli strains than seafood. Primary and secondary biotypes based on the use of
      four primary tests and six secondary tests were prospected. The most frequently
      encountered primary biotypes were: biotype 1 (42%), 11 (16%) and 9 (12%). These
      biotypes belonged to 32 secondary biotypes and 43 complete biotypes. The
      pathogenic serotypes isolated during this survey were O126B16 (3%), O26B6 (2%),
      O119B14 (2%), O86B7 (2%), O111B4 (2%), O55B5 (1%), O114K90 (1%) and O128B12 (1%).
      Two strains of E. coli were enteroinvasive by the test of Sereny. Results
      suggested that these typing methods may be used for discriminating strains of E. 
      coli.

PG  - 163-73
AB  - The Probiotics (Lactic acid bacteria) represent a nutritional live microbial
      supplement that positively affects host by enhancing the microbial balance. A
      survey is made of the most relevant studies concerning the use of probiotics in
      the prevention and treatment of infantile acute diarrhoea (by rotavirus or other 
      agents), pseudomembranous colitis, hospital-acquired and antibiotic-associated
      diarrhoeas. Although the probiotics mechanism of action is not yet completely
      understood, it has been hypothesized that they exert an inhibitory effect on the 
      intestinal inflammation by immune response modulation. Due to this property, the 
      use of probiotics has therefore been suggested in other severe diseases such as
      chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, food allergy, atopic
      dermatitis and as immunoadjuvant for oral vaccines.

AB  - HISTORY AND FINDINGS: An 82-year-old woman was admitted because of acute left
      heart failure with pulmonary oedema. There was a right basal pneumonia with
      congestion which was treated with amoxycillin and clavulanic acid. Severe watery 
      diarrhoea with more than 10 stools daily occurred. Clostridium difficile was not 
      isolated. INVESTIGATIONS: Coloscopy as far as the right flexure revealed
      proximally increasing whitish coatings, like those in severe pseudomembranous
      colitis (PMC), revealed as acute erosive colitis histologically. The plate-like
      incomplete erosions contained fibrin and granulocyte deposits so typical of PMC. 
      Clostridium difficile could again not be demonstrated. TREATMENT AND COURSE: As
      intestinal lavage, already undertaken in preparation of the coloscopy, markedly
      improved the symptoms it was repeated for therapeutic purposes. This brought
      about further improvement and a fall in granulocyte count from 29,500 G/l to
      10,700 G/l. Subsequently live E. coli bacteria (nissle 1917 strain) were
      administered. After 5 days stool frequency had fallen to one or two daily, each
      soft or partly formed. Stools were normal after a further week. Coloscopy 3 weeks
      after onset of treatment showed almost complete healing of the PMC. CONCLUSION:
      The successful treatment of PMC with intestinal lavage and physiological E. coli 
      administration agrees with the results of animal experiments and clinical
      experience. Whether it is an effective alternative to primary standard treatment 
      with vancomycin or metronidazole remains to be tested by further experience,
      preferably properly controlled therapeutic trials.

TI  - Serum immunoglobulin and immunoglobulin G subclasses in children with allergic
      colitis.
PG  - 206-9
AB  - Serum immunoglobulin and immunoglobulin G subclasses were measured in thirty
      children with histologically proven allergic colitis and twenty age matched
      controls. Serum immunoglobulin A (mean +/- sd) (0.45 +/- 0.25 vs 87 +/- 0.41
      Gm/L), IgG2 (29.2 +/- 13.1 vs 49.5 +/- 12.8 mg/dL), and IgG4 (7.58 +/- 3.01 vs
      11.2 +/- 2.59 mg/dL) were significantly lower in allergic colitis than in the
      controls respectively (p < 0.001). There was a significant elevation of serum IgE
      in those with allergic colitis (p < 0.01). The serum IgG1 and IgG3 levels were
      not significantly different in allergic colitis and the controls (p > 0.10).
      Immunoglobulin A, IgG2 and IgG4 subclasses were low in 43.3%, 75.0% and 55.0% of 
      cases of allergic colitis respectively, compared to 5.0% of the controls with low
      IgG2 and IgG4 (p < 0.005). The IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses were normal and
      comparable in both groups. Children with food allergic colitis in this study have
      low levels of IgG A, IgG2 and IgG4 subclasses. IgA, IgG2 and IgG4 subclass
      deficiency probably have a role to play in the pathogenesis of allergic colitis
      an mucosal immune defense mechanism.

TI  - Chemoprevention of colorectal cancer in inflammatory bowel disease? A potential
      role for folate.
PG  - 421-5
AB  - Patients with ulcerative colitis have an increased risk for developing colon
      cancer compared to the general population. The risk is related to the extension
      of the disease and its duration. This risk is the same for Crohn's colitis
      patients of equal extension and duration. By chemoprevention we mean the use of
      specific natural or synthetic chemical agents to reverse, suppress or prevent
      progression to invasive cancer. The chemopreventive agents for colon cancer are
      either of natural origin (vitamins, minerals, food constituents) or synthetic
      chemicals (difluoromethyl ornithine) and pharmaceutical agents (aspirin,
      oltipraz). Apart from folate, no other agent has so far been used in vivo for the
      prevention of colon cancer in long-standing inflammatory bowel disease. The use
      of folate was, however, not primarily intended to prevent cancer but to enhance
      folate absorption in ulcerative colitis. From retrospective studies, within the
      framework of cancer surveillance programmes, it became evident that folate
      supplementation may play a positive role as a chemopreventive agent against
      colorectal cancer in patients with long-standing, extensive ulcerative colitis.
      There is also evidence suggesting that folate supplementation may contribute to
      regulation of rectal cell proliferation in ulcerative colitis patients. There is 
      a real need for multicentre, randomized, prospective clinical studies in order to
      evaluate the promising role of folate in preventing colorectal cancer in patients
      with long-standing inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 788-91
AB  - Many nutritional issues are important in the care of children and adolescents
      with inflammatory bowel disease. No specific dietary toxin or antigen has been
      identified to have an etiologic role in either ulcerative colitis or Crohn's
      disease. A possible modulating effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on
      intestinal inflammation is being investigated. Most prevalent among the
      nutritional consequences of inflammatory bowel disease is weight loss, for which 
      inadequate caloric intake is primarily responsible. Impairment of linear growth
      and associated delay in pubertal development commonly complicate childhood
      Crohn's disease. The two major etiologic factors are chronic undernutrition and
      direct effects of inflammatory mediators secreted from the inflamed gut. Recent
      studies have incriminated interleukin-6. Treatment of intestinal inflammation and
      provision of adequate nutrition are of paramount importance in preventing or
      remedying growth impairment. Exclusive enteral nutrition using formulated food is
      efficacious primary therapy of active Crohn's disease, although the mode of
      action is poorly understood.

TI  - Escherichia coli O157:H7.
PG  - 1207-12
AB  - Escherichia coli O157 was first identified as a human pathogen in 1982. One of
      several Shiga toxin-producing serotypes known to cause human illness, the
      organism probably evolved through horizontal acquisition of genes for Shiga
      toxins and other virulence factors. E. coli O157 is found regularly in the faeces
      of healthy cattle, and is transmitted to humans through contaminated food, water,
      and direct contact with infected people or animals. Human infection is associated
      with a wide range of clinical illness, including asymptomatic shedding,
      non-bloody diarrhoea, haemorrhagic colitis, haemolytic uraemic syndrome, and
      death. Since laboratory practices vary, physicians need to know whether
      laboratories in their area routinely test for E. coli O157 in stool specimens.
      Treatment with antimicrobial agents remains controversial: some studies suggest
      that treatment may precipitate haemolytic uraemic syndrome, and other studies
      suggest no effect or even a protective effect. Physicians can help to prevent E. 
      coli O157 infections by counselling patients about the hazards of consuming
      undercooked ground meat or unpasteurised milk products and juices, and about the 
      importance of handwashing to prevent the spread of diarrhoeal illness, and by
      informing public-health authorities when they see unusual numbers of cases of
      bloody diarrhoea or haemolytic uraemic syndrome.

TI  - Perioperative growth hormone treatment increases nitrogen and fluid balance and
      results in short-term and long-term conservation of lean tissue mass.
PG  - 840-6
AB  - The surgical procedure for forming an ileoanal anastomosis with a J pouch (IAA)
      usually involves a temporary ileostomy; patients undergoing IAA surgery thus need
      to recover quickly because they return for ileostomy closure 3 mo later. We
      evaluated the effects of perioperative biosynthetic growth hormone (GH) treatment
      on short- and long-term changes in body composition and on nutritional intake.
      Patients with ulcerative colitis undergoing IAA surgery were randomly assigned to
      double-blind treatment with placebo (n=12) or 6 IU GH twice daily (n=12) from 2 d
      before to 7 d after the operation. Examinations were from 2 d before to 9 d after
      the operation and on days 30 and 90. Body composition was assessed with a
      dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanner. The 2 groups had similar nutritional
      intakes. On postoperative day 7, placebo-treated patients had lost 4.2 kg (95%
      CI: 3.0, 5.4) total tissue mass, 3.6 kg (2.1, 5.1) lean tissue mass, and 0.5 kg
      (-0.1, 1.2) fat mass. These reductions persisted 3 mo later. Compared with
      placebo, GH improved nitrogen balance, changes in lean tissue mass [gain of 4.0
      kg (1.9, 6.0), P=0.001], and changes in total tissue mass [gain of 3.2 kg (1.6,
      4.9), P=0.001], but increased the loss of fat mass [loss of 0.7 kg (0.0, 1.5),
      P=0.049] on postoperative day 7. Three months later, the placebo-treated patients
      had lost 2.4 kg (0.7, 4.2) more lean tissue mass than GH-treated patients
      (P=0.009), whereas changes in total tissue and fat mass were not significantly
      different. Hence, GH treatment enhanced the long-term regain of lean tissue mass.

TI  - Partial inhibition of amplifications by primers of EHEC genes.
PG  - 239-52
AB  - Diagnostic value of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was examined by
      using three primer pairs, specific for the common conserved region of stx1 and
      stx2, eae and an enterohaemolysin A gene (ehxA). The sensitivity in respect of
      each amplicon decreased with three exponents comparing to the individual PCR
      reactions. These PCR reactions were partially inhibited by the presence of
      certain additional primers. This inhibitory effect was template-concentration
      dependent, and was partially balanced by usage of increased amount of dNTP. Taq
      DNA polymerase in a range of 0.3-1.25 U/reaction did not influence the
      inhibition. The same inhibition was detected if the annealing temperature was
      changed from 48 degrees C to 57 degrees C. Pairs of EHEC primers inhibited a
      Salmonella enteritidis virulence-plasmid specific gene amplification, as well.
      Theoretical inhibiting effects were predicted by Primer Premier software but our 
      observations can be sufficiently explained neither by the competitions between
      the specific and aspecific amplifications nor by the inhibition caused by
      dimerization of primers.

AB  - On a beef carcass, Escherichia coli may sequentially encounter acid- and
      heat-intervention steps. This study tested whether acid stress (1.5% [vol/vol]
      acetic acid, pH 4.0, 37 degrees C, 15 min) would enhance subsequent heat
      resistance of E. coli. Initially, cells (E. coli O157:H7 ATCC 43894,
      nonpathogenic E. coli B [strain FRIK-124], and rpoS-deficient mutant 813-6
      [derived from E. coli O157:H7 ATCC 43895]) were acid stressed and transferred to 
      54 degrees C trypticase soy broth (TSB), and survivors were immediately
      enumerated after at least three intervals of 12, 2, and 6 min, respectively, by
      plating. The ATCC 43894 and 813-6 strains survived the acid stress but strain
      FRIK-124 did not. Acid-stressed ATCC 43894 had significantly lower D values than 
      the non-acid-stressed controls. Strain 813-6 had significantly lower D values
      than strain ATCC 43894, with no significant difference between acid-stressed and 
      non-acid-stressed cells. In a second experiment, cooling of cells prior to
      plating resulted in an increased D value for acid-stressed ATCC 43894 cells, such
      that it was not significantly different from the D value for non-acid-stressed
      controls. Using this protocol, there was no significant difference in D values
      between acid-stressed and non-acid-stressed ATCC 43894 cells in prewarmed TSB
      (54, 58, and 62 degrees C), in prewarmed ground beef slurry (GBS; 58 degrees C), 
      or in TSB and GBS inoculated at 5 degrees C and heated to 58 degrees C. The acid 
      stress tested does not enhance subsequent heat resistance of E. coli.

PG  - 1946-8
AB  - Sumatriptan succinate, a serotonin-1 (5-hydroxytryptamine-1) receptor agonist, is
      an antimigraine drug that is reported to act by selectively constricting
      intracranial arteries. Recently, vasopressor responses that are distinct from the
      cranial circulation have been demonstrated to occur in the systemic, pulmonary,
      and coronary circulations. Cases have been published of coronary vasospasm,
      myocardial ischemia, and myocardial infarction occurring after sumatriptan use.
      We report on the development of 8 serious cases of ischemic colitis in patients
      with migraine treated with sumatriptan.

TI  - [Implications of bacterial protein toxins in infectious and food-borne diseases].
PG  - 485-502
AB  - Among the 315 protein toxins elicited by gram positive and gram negative bacteria
      so far characterized, about 50 toxins are currently considered as totally or
      partially, responsible of the pathological manifestations and/or lethality
      resulting from host infection or intoxication (contaminated food) by relevant
      toxinogenic bacteria. A certain number of criteria are required for the
      assessment of indisputable involvement of a toxin or an array of toxins (from the
      same bacteria) in infectious diseases: 1) The bacterial microorganism clearly
      identified as the pathogenic agent of the disease produces component(s)
      considered as toxin(s); 2) The administration to appropriate animal(s) of the
      toxin(s) separated from the relevant bacteria or produced by genetic engineering 
      from a heterologous tox+ recombinant bacterial strain produces symptoms and
      pathophysiological disorders that mimic those observed in the natural disease or 
      at least those elicited in experimental animals by the cognate toxin-producing
      bacteria; 3) The in vitro incubation of the isolated toxin(s) with appropriate
      animal organs, tissues or cells elicits certain pathophysiological, biochemical
      or metabolic manifestions observed in the host infected with the relevant
      toxinogenic bacteria; 4) Toxin concentration in the organism of the host infected
      by the toxinogenic bacteria should be compatible with the characteristics of the 
      relevant disease. The toxins of pathogenic interest exhibit a variety of effects 
      in bacterial diseases. Bacteria that colonize a wound or mucosal surface but do
      not invade target cells can produce toxins that act locally or enter the
      bloodstream and attack internal organs (e.g. Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Vibrio 
      cholerae, ...). Bacteria growing in a wound can produce toxins that destroy host 
      tissue and kill phagocytes in the immediate vicinity of the bacteria, thus
      facilitating bacterial growth and spread. On the basis of the above mentioned
      criteria, the following bacterial diseases among many others are toxin-associated
      (toxinoses): diphtheria, tetanus, botulism, whooping cough, diarrhea, bloody
      diarrhea, hemolytic uremic syndrome, cholera, scarlet fever, toxic shock
      syndrome, gas gangrene, B. fragilis diarrhea, anthrax, pseudomembranous colitis.

TI  - Prevention and control of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) infections: 
      memorandum from a WHO meeting. WHO Consultation on Prevention and Control of
      Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) Infections.
PG  - 245-55
AB  - Escherichia coli is a commonly occurring inhabitant of the intestine of humans
      and other animals, but there are several pathogenic types of E. coli which cause 
      a variety of human diseases. One of these pathogenic types, E. coli O157:H7,
      belongs to the group of enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) which produce potent
      toxins and cause a particularly severe form of disease, haemorrhagic colitis
      (HC). About 10% of patients with HC can go on to develop haemolytic uraemic
      syndrome (HUS), a life-threatening complication of E. coli O157:H7 infection that
      is characterized by acute renal failure, haemolytic anaemia, and
      thrombocytopenia. These sequelae are particularly serious in young children and
      older people. On average, 2-7% of patients with HUS die, but in some outbreaks
      among the elderly the mortality rate has been as high as 50%. This Memorandum
      reviews the growing importance of E. coli O157:H7 as a foodborne pathogen and
      reports on the issues of surveillance, outbreak investigation, and control
      strategies with respect to EHEC infections that were discussed at the WHO
      Consultation on Prevention and Control of EHEC Infections, held in Geneva on 28
      April to 1 May 1997. Recommended measures for prevention and control include the 
      following: use of potable water in food production; presentation of clean animals
      at slaughter; improved hygiene throughout the slaughter process; appropriate use 
      of food processing measures; thorough cooking of foods; and the education of food
      handlers, abattoir workers, and farm workers on the principles and application of
      food hygiene.

TI  - Food allergy, coeliac disease and chronic inflammatory bowel disease in man.
PG  - S49-52
AB  - It is often stated that the gastrointestinal tract has a limited number of
      responses to pathogens. Entirely different agents can produce a similar
      histopathological reaction. However, the expression of the disease in man is very
      heterogeneous, it varies with the age of the subject and is to a certain extent
      genetically determined. For example, food allergy is frequent in childhood and
      not common in adulthood. The intestinal mucosa in the child with cows milk
      allergy shows a 'flat' mucosa, which may be indistinguishable of that observed in
      gluten sensitive enteropathy or coeliac disease. Subjects with other forms of
      food allergy may have a morphologically normal small intestinal mucosa,
      occasionally with increased IgE plasma cells and often only characterised by an
      increased intestinal permeability. An abnormal intestinal permeability is one of 
      the hallmarks of an inflamed gut, however, subjects with a latent form of coeliac
      disease have an abnormal permeability only without overt signs of inflammation.
      Recently, it has become clear that what determines the characteristics of the
      intestinal inflammatory response is dependent on the cytokines involved during
      the response and this seems to be the same in the stomach, the small intestine
      and the colon. A so-called Th1 response, with an increased production of
      IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and other pro-inflammatory cytokines, occurs in the stomach 
      when infected by Helicobacter pylori, in the small intestine when the subject
      with coeliac disease consumes normal bread and during the active phases of
      Crohn's disease. A Th2 response is characteristic of the allergic subject and
      there is some evidence that it is the predominant response in subjects with
      ulcerative colitis. We still do not know the fine-tuning of the cytokine response
      but IL-12 appears to be a key cytokine in polarising the response to a Th1 type. 
      More recently it has become clear that the intestinal mucosa has a unique subset 
      of CD4+ T cells that secrete TGF-beta (Th3 cells) that provide help for IgA.
      These cells have downregulatory properties for Th1 cells and therefore play an
      important role in the active suppression of oral tolerance and IgE response. What
      determines that an individual develops one of these diseases? It is now clear
      that these different pathological entities are multifactorial. Different
      environmental factors and a complex genetic predisposition where more that one
      gene and more than one chromosome are involved. The extent and severity of the
      inflammatory response depends on the genetic diversity of the bacteria or the
      amount of the antigen on the one hand and on the genetic constitution of the host
      on the other. The abnormal immune response in the human gut is predominantly a
      Th1-like inflammatory response. This can be elicited by bacteria, peptides,
      possibly the bacterial flora and some viruses. The recent findings in the
      pathogenesis of the intestinal inflammatory response will probably alter the
      therapy of the future.

TI  - Altered plasma and mucosal concentrations of trace elements and antioxidants in
      active ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 644-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The production of free radicals is increased in inflammatory bowel
      disease, and trace elements are crucial components of several antioxidants. Trace
      elements deficiency may therefore compromise the defense against oxidative
      damage. The aims of this study were to measure plasma and tissue concentration of
      trace elements and antioxidants and to relate this to disease activity. METHODS: 
      A 10-ml blood sample and six colonic biopsy specimens were obtained from 24
      patients with either active ulcerative colitis or in remission and 10 patients
      with irritable bowel syndrome for measurement of trace elements and trace
      element-dependent enzymes. RESULTS: Patients with moderately active disease had
      significantly lower plasma iron, selenium, and glutathione peroxidase levels than
      patients in remission and controls, whereas no significant differences were found
      between the zinc and copper values of patients and controls. Mucosal
      concentrations of zinc and metallothionein were reduced, whereas iron and
      glutathione peroxidase concentrations were increased in patients with
      endoscopically active disease as compared with controls and patients in
      remission. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ulcerative colitis have altered plasma and 
      tissue levels of trace elements and antioxidant-related enzymes. The resulting
      reduced protection against free radicals may contribute to the inflammatory
      process.

TI  - Development of a colony lift immunoassay to facilitate rapid detection and
      quantification of Escherichia coli O157:H7 from agar plates and filter monitor
      membranes.
PG  - 567-73
AB  - E. coli O157:H7 is a food-borne adulterant that can cause hemorrhagic ulcerative 
      colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome. Faced with an increasing risk of foods
      contaminated with E. coli O157:H7, food safety officials are seeking improved
      methods to detect and isolate E. coli O157:H7 in hazard analysis and critical
      control point systems in meat- and poultry-processing plants. A colony lift
      immunoassay was developed to facilitate the positive identification and
      quantification of E. coli O157:H7 by incorporating a simple colony lift
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with filter monitors and traditional culture
      methods. Polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, Bedford, Mass.)
      were prewet with methanol and were used to make replicates of every bacterial
      colony on agar plates or filter monitor membranes that were then reincubated for 
      15 to 18 h at 36 +/- 1 degree C, during which the colonies not only remained
      viable but were reestablished. The membranes were dried, blocked with blocking
      buffer (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories [KPL], Gaithersburg, Md.), and exposed 
      for 7 min to an affinity-purified horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-E.
      coli O157 antibody (KPL). The membranes were washed, exposed to a
      3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine membrane substrate (TMB; KPL) or aminoethyl
      carbazole (AEC; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.), rinsed in deionized water,
      and air dried. Colonies of E. coli O157:H7 were identified by either a blue (via 
      TMB) or a red (via AEC) color reaction. The colored spots on the PVDF lift
      membrane were then matched to their respective parent colonies on the agar plates
      or filter monitor membranes. The colony lift immunoassay was tested with a wide
      range of genera in the family Enterobacteriaceae as well as different serotypes
      within the E. coli genus. The colony lift immunoassay provided a simple, rapid,
      and accurate method for confirming the presence of E. coli O157:H7 colonies
      isolated on filter monitors or spread plates by traditional culture methods. An
      advantage of using the colony lift immunoassay is the ability to test every
      colony serologically on an agar plate or filter monitor membrane simultaneously
      for the presence of the E. coli O157 antigen. This colony lift immunoassay has
      recently been successfully incorporated into a rapid-detection, isolation, and
      quantification system for E. coli O157:H7, developed in our laboratories for
      retail meat sampling.

TI  - Modern life' in the epidemiology of inflammatory bowel disease: a case-control
      study with special emphasis on nutritional factors.
PG  - 243-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The rising incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) since the
      Second World War coincides with profound changes of the dietary pattern. The aim 
      of the study was to investigate the possible pathogenic role of some
      characteristic 'modern life' dietary factors in IBD. DESIGN: Case-control,
      studying risk factors in recently diagnosed cases, 290 with Crohn's disease and
      398 with ulcerative colitis, compared with 616 population controls. Smoking, age,
      gender and education were taken into account by using logistic regression
      analysis. SETTING: Hospital cases and population controls. INTERVENTIONS:
      Questionnaires. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Logistic regression-derived odds ratios.
      RESULTS: A positive association with cola drinks [OR: 2.2 (95% CI 1.5-3.1)],
      chewing gum [OR: 1.5 (95% CI: 1.1-2.1)] and chocolate consumption [OR: 2.5 (95%
      CI: 1.8-3.5)] and a negative association with citrus fruit consumption [OR: 0.5
      (95% CI 0.3-0.7)] and the development of Crohn's disease were found. Consumption 
      of cola drinks [OR: 1.6 (95% CI 1.1-2.3)] and chocolate consumption [OR: 2.5 (95%
      CI 1.8-3.5)] were positively associated with developing ulcerative colitis. There
      was a negative association between the intake of citrus fruits [OR: 0.5 (95% CI
      0.4-0.8)] and 'having a stuffed pet' for a period longer than 5 years [OR: 0.6
      (95% CI 0.4-0.9)] and developing the disorder. No association with the frequency 
      of tooth brushing and developing IBD was found. CONCLUSION: All the nutritional
      items mentioned may be true risk factors or they just might be the expression of 
      a modern life-style also involving other risk factors for the development of IBD 
      which at the present are still unknown.

TI  - Nutritional factors in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 235-7
AB  - During the past 20 years there has been growing interest in the importance of
      nutritional factors in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. There are 
      so far no definite links between ulcerative colitis and diet, but links with
      Crohn's disease have been studied by both epidemiologists and clinicians.
      Epidemiological studies, although retrospective, have suggested that patients
      with Crohn's disease eat more sugar and sweets that control individuals; however,
      when dietary sugar is restricted, there is little clinical benefit. The clinical 
      approach to nutrition in Crohn's disease has been by the use of elemental diets, 
      which will produce symptomatic and objective remission in up to 90% of compliant 
      patients. Those who return to normal eating soon relapse but, in some studies,
      have enjoyed prolonged remission on exclusion diets. The foods excluded have been
      not sugar, but predominantly cereals, dairy products and yeast. Attention has now
      switched to the possible harmful role of fat in Crohn's disease. The efficacy of 
      elemental feeds appears to depend not on the presentation of nitrogen but on the 
      amount of long chain triglyceride present. Increases in recent years in the
      frequency of Crohn's disease in Japan have been correlated with increased dietary
      fat intake, and a recent study suggested that W-3 fatty acids, which are
      metabolized by immunomodulatory leukotrienes and prostaglandins, may have a
      beneficial role to play. The links between nutrition and Crohn's disease have now
      become strong and the role of fat may be the most exciting of all.

TI  - A prospective study of dietary fiber types and symptomatic diverticular disease
      in men.
PG  - 714-9
AB  - To examine prospectively dietary fiber calculated from food composition values
      based on analytic techniques and specific dietary fiber types in relation to risk
      of diverticular disease, we analyzed data from a prospective cohort of 43,881
      U.S. male health professionals 40-75 y of age at base line; subjects were free of
      diagnosed diverticular disease, colon or rectal polyps, ulcerative colitis and
      cancer. The insoluble component of fiber was inversely associated with risk of
      diverticular disease relative risk (RR) = 0. 63, 95% confidence interval (CI),
      0.44-0.91, P for trend = 0.02, and this association was particularly strong for
      cellulose (RR = 0.52, 95% CI, 0.36-0.75, P for trend = 0.002). The association
      between diverticular disease and total dietary fiber intake calculated from the
      AOACstandards method was not appreciably different from results using the
      Southgate or Englyst method [for AOAC method, RR = 0.60, 95% CI, 0.41-0.87; for
      Southgate method, RR = 0.61, 95% CI, 0.42-0. 88; for Englyst method, RR = 0.60,
      95% CI, 0.42-0.87, for the highest quintiles]. Our findings provide evidence for 
      the hypothesis that a diet high in dietary fiber decreases the risk of
      diverticular disease, and this result was not sensitive to the use of different
      analytic techniques to define dietary fiber. Our findings suggest that the
      insoluble component of fiber was significantly associated with a decreased risk
      of diverticular disease, and this inverse association was particularly strong for
      cellulose.

TI  - [Inflammatory bowel disease: importance of nutrition today].
PG  - 289-98
AB  - Malnutrition is a very common situation in patients inflammatory with intestinal 
      disease (IID), which can be caused by a multitude of factors. It has been shown
      that nutritional support not only improves the nutritional condition of the
      patients, but in Crohn's disease it also has an effect on the activity of the
      disease, although this effect is smaller than that of steroids. Elemental diets
      are no more efficient than polymeric diets except under very special
      circumstances, but they are more expensive and patients tolerate them worse. A
      digestive pause is not recommended unless there is an absolute contraindication
      for the use of the digestive tract. Therefore, parenteral nutrition, which is
      more expensive and can cause serious complications, will be reserved for very
      specific indications. The use of fish oil supplements, either because it competes
      with arachidonic acid and prevents the initiation of the inflammatory cascade, or
      because it decreases the production of cytokines, has shown to be potentially
      useful in inflammatory intestinal disease, and this must be confirmed by further 
      studies. Short chain fatty acids enemas have shown promising results in distal
      ulcerative colitis but the lack of homogeneity in the studies makes it necessary 
      for these results to be consolidated in new studies. Nutritional support is
      especially interesting in children with inflammatory intestinal disease given
      that the growth retardation which is often seen in severe cases, can be
      controlled by adequate enteral or parenteral diets.

TI  - Altered colonic environment, a possible predisposition to colorectal cancer and
      colonic inflammatory bowel disease: rationale of dietary manipulation with
      emphasis on disaccharides.
PG  - 133-46
AB  - A recurrent theme in the schema of pathogenetic mechanisms attributed to
      colorectal cancer (CRC) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is the interaction
      between genes and environment. Dietary and other environmental factors, and lower
      intestinal flora and their chemical interactions occur in the pathogenesis of
      both. Events at the mucosal surface may be influenced by factors in the luminal
      environment and by contributions of the host. In addition, both forms of
      IBD--Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)--have distinctive
      associated host events. Even within CD and UC, different clinical patterns and
      prognoses may have different specific host mechanisms. Some of the current
      putative pathogenetic processes in CRC and IBD are reviewed. Particular attention
      is given to hypotheses relating to the role of dietetic substances, mainly fibre 
      and dairy products, and how they may affect disease formation. It is argued that 
      within the context of hypotheses proposed for possible beneficial effects of
      these two dietetic factors, CRC and IBD may be considered together. Further
      support is lent to arguments that similar and additional hypothetical features
      ascribed to beneficial effects of fibre may be attributed to disaccharides,
      lactose and its derivatives, lactulose and lactitol.

TI  - Nutritional issues and therapy in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 21-30
AB  - Nutritional issues in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) often receive inadequate
      attention both in regard to therapy and nutritionally related complications of
      IBD. This article reviews much of the research that has evaluated the role of
      diet in the causation, primary treatment, and adjunctive therapy of both
      ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Benefits have been demonstrated
      in the use of elemental diets or polymeric diets in CD in both acute flare up or 
      maintenance of IBD. A careful team approach can overcome problems in implementing
      nutritional therapy. Nutrition also has a critical benefit in postoperative CD
      and perioperative UC. Numerous easily corrected, nutritional abnormalities are
      often overlooked in patients with IBD, which may have significant consequences.
      Nutritional therapy may have a central place in the hierarchy of treatment in IBD
      and further research is critical in this area to better define the benefits of
      nutrition in IBD.

      levels of selected micronutrients].
PG  - 674-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Optimal saturation of organism by micronutrients--vitamins and trace 
      elements--has a significant inhibitory effect on the origin and development of
      malign diseases. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate the blood
      levels of A, C and E vitamins, Beta-carotene, zinc, and selenium in 249 patients 
      with precanceroses (atrophic gastritis, hyperplastic polyp of the stomach,
      adenomas of the stomach and colorectum, ulcerative colitis), 96 patients with
      carcinoma of the stomach or colorectum, and to compare them with a control group 
      of 130 people. RESULTS: We have discovered the frequency of decreased average
      levels of micronutrients in patients with precanceroses as follows: vitamin C >
      vitamins E and A > selenium > beta carotene. In all groups of patients with
      carcinoma the average levels of vitamins and Beta-carotene were significantly
      decreased, the level of selenium has decreased only in the group of gastric
      carcinoma. The copper level was increased in the group of ulcerative colitis and 
      in all groups with carcinoma. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that in the
      primary prevention of these malign diseases it is necessary to improve the levels
      of the presented micronutrients in the population of the Slovak Republic by
      increasing the intake of fruit, vegetables and other sources of nutrition, the
      secondary prevention in persons with precanceroses requires an appropriate
      intermittent supplementation of micronutrients (chemoprevention). (Tab. 3, Ref.
      24.)

TI  - [Nutritional deficiencies and complications in chronic inflammatory bowel
      diseases].
PG  - 6-10
AB  - BACKGROUND: Deficiencies of vitamins and trace elements are frequent in
      inflammatory bowel disease. Aim of this study was to evaluate retrospectively the
      prevalence of these deficiencies and of liver complications in a large
      population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The records from 392 out-patients, 279 with
      Crohn's disease (160 female, 119 male) and 113 with ulcerative colitis (56
      female, 57 male) were analyzed. RESULTS: Deficiencies were found in 85% of
      patients with Crohn's disease vs 68% with ulcerative colitis during the course of
      the disease, predominantly a deficiency of iron and of calcium. Less frequently
      deficiencies of zinc, protein, cyanocobalamin, and folic acid were found.
      Elevated liver enzymes were seen in 38% of patients with Crohn's disease vs 27%
      with ulcerative colitis. In order of frequency: gamma-glutamyl-transferase, ALAT,
      AP, ASAT, and bilirubin. Gallstones were present in 12% of patients with Crohn's 
      disease and 4% with ulcerative colitis. 6% of patients with Crohn's disease and
      4% with ulcerative colitis had kidney stones. CONCLUSIONS: In view of the high
      frequency of deficiencies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease it seems to
      be important to check frequently for extraintestinal complications.

TI  - Absorption of all-trans and 9-cis beta-carotene in human ileostomy volunteers.
PG  - 585-91
AB  - 1. Mass balance studies were carried out in fasted ileostomy subjects (n = 5)
      given an oral physiological dose (10 mg) of beta-carotene [all-trans: 9-cis,
      84:16 (w/w)] dispersed in vegetable oil. Blood and ileal effluent samples were
      collected and analysed for beta-carotene. 2. Results showed that 90% (range
      97.0-74.3%) of the total beta-carotene was absorbed without measurable
      perturbation of plasma total beta-carotene concentration, or change in the
      all-trans: 9-cis beta-carotene ratio. Peak loss of beta-carotene in ileal
      effluent occurred at 4.9 h (range 2.9-8.4 h) postingestion, and no further loss
      was detected after 5.4-12.4 h, depending upon the individual. Comparison of the
      ratio of all trans-beta-carotene to 9 cis-beta-carotene in the test meal and
      effluent indicated that isomerization did not occur during passage through the
      gastrointestinal tract and that both isomers were similarly absorbed. However,
      the all-trans: 9-cis beta-carotene ratio of the plasma did not change. Reasoned
      assumptions allowed the construction of a mathematical model of plasma
      beta-carotene disposal. 3. It is concluded that physiological doses of isolated
      all-trans and 9-cis beta-carotene are well absorbed without necessarily causing
      detectable excursions in plasma beta-carotene concentrations, or altering the
      ratio of all-trans to 9-cis beta-carotene. Isomerization of beta-carotene does
      not occur during passage through the gastrointestinal tract. Absorbed
      beta-carotene is rapidly cleared from the plasma to an unobservable pool at a
      rate similar to that of chylomicron triacylglycerol.

TI  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli. A dangerous food-borne pathogen.
PG  - 179-80, 185-7
AB  - Since 1982, several outbreaks of hemorrhagic colitis due to EHEC, or E coli
      O157:H7, have occurred in the United States and other parts of the world.
      Contaminated, undercooked ground beef has been most frequently implicated in the 
      outbreaks, although unpasteurized dairy products and other foods have also been
      the source of infection in sporadic cases. The most common clinical manifestation
      of EHEC infection is abdominal cramps and watery, bloody diarrhea. HUS secondary 
      to the initial colitis develops in about 10% of patients under 10 years of age.
      Definitive diagnosis is made by isolation and identification of EHEC in stool
      samples. Treatment focuses on rehydration and supportive therapy. The use of
      antimicrobial agents, narcotics, or antimotility agents is not recommended,
      because they neither shorten the course of illness nor prevent the development of
      sequelae.

TI  - [Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and hemolytic-uremic syndrome].
PG  - 669-77
AB  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) are increasingly identified as the
      cause of diarrhea and hemorrhagic colitis in countries with highly developed
      livestock. In 5-10% of patients, full-blown hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)
      occurs as a postinfectious life-threatening complication. Up to 1996, 5 out of 39
      patients (12.8%) with EHEC O157 infections in Austria developed HUS. Acute
      complications of HUS such as brain edema may also lead to death; one fatal
      outcome has been observed so far in Austrian patients. Aside from the cytotoxic
      Shiga toxins, other different pathogenic factors are often found in clinical EHEC
      isolates. These include a cytolysin termed EHEC-hemolysin and a low molecular
      heat-stabile enterotoxin. Furthermore, most EHEC strains express an important
      surface protein, intimin, which is important for adherence to intestinal
      epithelial cells. EHEC are heterogeneous in their antigenic structure (O-,
      H-antigens). In Austria O157:H7 and O157:H- are the dominating serogroups; in
      1997 the first Austrian case of HUS due to EHEC O26:H11 was documented. Because
      there are no known reliable phenotypical markers for EHEC, diagnostic strategies 
      should focus on the demonstration of Shiga toxins or Shiga toxin genes. For
      epidemiological purposes it is also important to attempt to isolate the causative
      agent. Cows and other ruminants are reservoirs for EHEC. In the Tyrol 3% of
      unpasteurised milk samples, up to 10% of minced beef samples, and 6% of calves
      yield EHEC O157. Aside from transmission via contaminated food, direct
      transmission from person to person also plays a major role in the chain of EHEC
      infection. In contrast to Italy and Bavaria, Austria has not experienced a major 
      outbreak due to this organism so far. A nationwide surveillance system of HUS has
      shown an incidence of 0.37 HUS cases per 100,000 residents in the age group 0-14 
      years for 1995 (Italy: 0.2 cases per 100,000; Bavaria: approx. 1.5 cases per
      100,000).

TI  - [When the fluoro-immuno-enzymatic (FEIA) measurements turn out to be more
      sensitive than radioimmunologic (RIA) measurements. Application to the
      measurement of serum tryptase].
PG  - 239-41
AB  - The measurement of Tryptase by the Fluoro-Immuno-Enzymatic (FEIA) method is
      nowadays possible on the Pharmacia CAP system (automatic UniCAP). This
      measurement is more comprehensive as it measures the release of serum tryptase
      from both the tissue mastocytes (MCTC) as well as the mucosal mastocytes (MCM).
      Technically the measurements are comparable with those made by the method of
      radio-immunology (RIA), are absolutely reproducible and surprisingly at 100%. It 
      has also been possible to evaluate the two techniques of FEIA and RIA on negative
      and positive pools. This new FEIA technique for serum tryptase is applicable: to 
      anaphylactic and/or anaphylactoid accidents at the time of induction of
      anesthesia, in general conditions such as haemorrhagic recto colitis (RCH),
      Crohn's disease, and mastocytosis. Finally these measurements can be used during 
      nasal and bronchial provocation tests, as the measurements may be made on nasal
      and bronchial lavage liquids. The sensitivity and the very good reproducibility
      of this new technique of FEIA for tryptase is of very great interest and avoids
      use of radio-active isotopes.

TI  - Metabolic characteristics of healthy adult males as affected by ingestion of a
      liquid nutritional formula containing fish oil, oligosaccharides, gum arabic and 
      antioxidant vitamins.
PG  - 1165-76
AB  - n-3 Fatty acids from fish oil and short-chain fatty acids produced from
      fermentation of oligosaccharides may attenuate a portion of gut injury and
      inflammation associated with ulcerative colitis. The purpose of this study was to
      assess the effects of an enteral nutritional formula containing supplemental
      oligosaccharides, gum arabic and fish oil on serum metabolite profiles,
      haematology, plasma and red blood cell membrane phospholipid fatty acid profiles,
      urinary constituent, and safety in healthy human adult males. 30 subjects were
      randomly assigned to one of two treatments, a control formula (n = 10) and an
      ulcerative colitis nutritional formula (UCNF; n = 20). Formulas contained
      comparable levels of protein, fat and non-structural carbohydrates. Daily intake 
      of the formulas provided nutrients to meet or exceed the recommended daily
      allowance. Intake was recorded daily while blood and urine samples were collected
      weekly on days 0, 7 and 14. Certain subjects consuming large quantities of the
      UCNF experienced some abdominal distention, gas and loose stools. Sole source
      intake of the UCNF was safe over 14 days as assessed by routine measurements of
      serum metabolite profiles, haematology and urinalysis compared with subjects fed 
      the control formula. Substantial decreases in plasma and red blood cell
      phospholipid 18:2n-6 and increases in 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 within 1 wk of feeding 
      the UCNF were noted.

PG  - R201-5
AB  - An outbreak of food poisoning due to Escherichia coli O157 phage type 2 Vero
      cytotoxin 2 affected 26 people in southern counties of England in May and June
      1995. The organism was isolated from faecal specimens from 23 patients, 16 of
      whom lived in Dorset and seven in Hampshire. Isolates were indistinguishable by
      phage typing, Vero cytotoxin gene typing, restriction fragment length
      polymorphism, and pulsed field gel electrophoresis. Three associated cases,
      linked epidemiologically to the outbreak, were confirmed serologically by
      detection of antibodies to E. coli O157 lipopolysaccharide. Twenty-two of the 26 
      patients were adults: four were admitted to hospital with haemorrhagic colitis.
      Four cases were children: two were admitted to hospital with haemolytic uraemic
      syndrome (HUS). There were no deaths. Although E. coli O157 was not isolated from
      any food samples, illness was associated with having eaten cold meats in
      sandwiches bought from two sandwich producers, in Weymouth and in Portsmouth.
      Both shops were supplied by the same wholesaler, who kept no records and obtained
      cooked meats from several sources in packs that did not carry adequate
      identification marks. It was, therefore, impossible to trace back to the original
      producer or to investigate further to determine the origin of contamination with 
      E. coli O157. To protect the public health it is essential that all wholesale
      packs of ready-to-eat food carry date codes and the producer's identification
      mark. Detailed record keeping should be part of hazard analysis critical control 
      point (HACCP) systems and should be maintained throughout the chain of
      distribution from the producer to retail outlets.

TI  - Dientamoeba fragilis masquerading as allergic colitis.
PG  - 16-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dientamoeba fragilis is a rare cause of chronic infectious diarrhea
      and colitis in children. METHODS: Review of the clinical manifestations,
      diagnostic methods, and clinical course of D. fragilis infection in our hospital.
      RESULTS: Eleven pediatric patients are discussed, seven of whom had a history of 
      recent travel. Clinical manifestations of infectious diarrhea included anorexia, 
      intermittent vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, ranging from 1 to 100 weeks 
      in duration. Peripheral eosinophilia was present in seven patients. One patient
      with well-documented bovine protein allergy had intermittent episodes of diarrhea
      and abdominal pain, despite an appropriate elimination diet. Eosinophilic colitis
      documented by colonoscopy, was due to D. fragilis. Metronidazole was effective in
      treating five patients, and iodoquinol was effective in treating four others.
      CONCLUSIONS: D. fragilis should be included in the differential diagnosis of
      chronic diarrhea and eosinophilic colitis. The identification of this pathogen
      requires clinical awareness of epidemiologic risk factors and presenting
      complaints, as well as the laboratory staining procedures essential to its proper
      identification.

TI  - A randomized, double-blind study of the effect of olestra on disease activity in 
      patients with quiescent inflammatory bowel disease. Olestra in IBD Study Group.
PG  - 389-99
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the effects of olestra, a zero-calorie fat substitute that 
      is neither digested nor absorbed, on the well-being and disease state of persons 
      with chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in remission. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
      Eighty-nine patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis (n = 43) or Crohn's
      disease (n = 46) in remission, with a history of disease of 2 years or longer,
      were enrolled in this prospective study from nine private practices, three
      university-based medical centers, and one Veterans Administration medical center 
      in the United States. Forty-four patients were randomly assigned to receive
      olestra and 45 to receive triglycerides in chips or cookies daily for 4 weeks. At
      Week 4, patients were classified as in remission, worsened, or relapsed according
      to an investigator's global assessment based on sigmoidoscopy (for ulcerative
      colitis) or the Crohn's disease activity index, laboratory findings, and clinical
      course. RESULTS: At Week 4, the olestra and triglyceride groups did not differ
      significantly with respect to the percentages of patients who relapsed (P =
      0.494; difference = 2.4%; upper 95% CL = 8.8%) or with respect to the percentages
      of patients who experienced any worsening of their symptoms (P = 0.630;
      difference = 0.2%; upper 95% CL = 13.3%). Of evaluable patients, 90% (37 of 41)
      given olestra remained in remission with no worsening, compared with 90% (38 of
      42) given triglycerides. Gastrointestinal symptoms were comparable between the
      treatment groups, and there were no treatment-related laboratory abnormalities.
      Six patients were excluded from analysis for reasons unrelated to treatment.
      CONCLUSION: Olestra did not affect the activity of quiescent mild to moderate
      IBD.

TI  - Intolerance to protein hydrolysate infant formulas: an underrecognized cause of
      gastrointestinal symptoms in infants.
PG  - 741-4
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of an amino
      acid-based infant formula in infants with continued symptoms suggestive of
      formula protein intolerance while they were receiving casein hydrolysate formula 
      (CHF). Twenty-eight infants, 22 to 173 days of age, were enrolled; each had
      received CHF for an average of 40 days (10 to 173 days) and continued to have
      bloody stools, vomiting, diarrhea, irritability, or failure to gain weight, or a 
      combination of these symptoms. Sigmoidoscopy with rectal biopsy was performed in 
      all infants. The infants then received an amino acid-based infant formula,
      Neocate, for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks of treatment, 25 of the infants demonstrated 
      resolution of their symptoms and underwent challenge with CHF. Of the 25 who were
      challenged, eight tolerated the CHF and the remainder had recurrence of their
      symptoms. The histologic features in these infants varied from eosinophilic
      infiltration to normal. We conclude that not all infants with apparent formula
      protein-induced colitis respond to CHF and that these infants may have resolution
      of their symptoms when fed an amino acid-based infant formula.

TI  - Gallbladder motility and cholecystokinin secretion during continuous enteral
      nutrition.
PG  - 2274-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: During total parenteral nutrition, gallbladder motility is impaired, 
      resulting in sludge and stone formation. Little is known about gallbladder
      motility during prolonged enteral nutrition. METHODS: We studied gallbladder
      motility during continuous enteral nutrition (CEN) in nine hospitalized patients 
      with active inflammatory bowel disease. The patients received a polymeric diet
      (2000 kcal/24 h) by CEN through a nasogastric tube for a prolonged period.
      Gallbladder volumes were obtained daily by ultrasonography, starting from day 0
      (before CEN) and on 7 consecutive days during CEN. At days 0, 1, 4, and 7, the
      gallbladder response to i.v. cholecystokinin (CCK-33; 0.5 Ivy Dog unit/kg/h) was 
      studied. Plasma CCK levels were determined at regular intervals by
      radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed on day 0
      between patients and a group of nine healthy control subjects in fasting
      gallbladder volumes (19.4 +/- 2.3 and 19.6 +/- 2.4 cm3, respectively) and
      gallbladder contraction during CCK infusion (56 +/- 14% and 69 +/- 7%,
      respectively). During CEN, from day 1 to day 7, mean gallbladder volume remained 
      significantly (p < 0.05) reduced compared with fasting gallbladder volume, and
      mean plasma CCK levels remained significantly (p < 0.05) increased compared with 
      fasting levels. Although gallbladder volume was significantly reduced during CEN,
      the gallbladder contractile response to CCK was not affected; at days 1, 4, and
      7, gallbladder contraction was 36-57%. CONCLUSIONS: During CEN, 1) gallbladder
      volume is significantly reduced and plasma CCK levels are significantly
      increased, 2) these effects are sustained over time (7 days), and 3) the
      gallbladder remains responsive to exogenous CCK. These results indicate that
      gallbladder contractility and gallbladder responsiveness to CCK are preserved
      during prolonged CEN in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Shiga toxin mode of action in E. coli O157:H7 disease.
PG  - d635-42
AB  - Shiga toxins (Stx) are virulence factors produced by selected bacteria pathogenic
      for humans. These multicomponent protein complexes are among the more potent
      toxins known. As inhibitors of eukaryotic protein synthesis, these toxins
      selectively inactivate ribosomes in an enzymatic manner. Specificity of cell
      targeting is determined by the high-affinity binding of Stx to its receptor, a
      glycosphingolipid (Gb3) located in the plasma membrane or some eukaryotic cells. 
      Elaborated by food-borne E. coli O157:H7 bacteria, isotypes of Stx (Stx1 & Stx2) 
      are required for the ensuing vascular changes in humans, including hemorrhagic
      colitis and renal hemolytic uremic syndrome. Experimental therapeutic
      intervention of Stx-associated disease includes the Stx receptor immobilized on
      biologically inert particles designed for oral presentation.

TI  - Antiinflammatory effects of human milk on chemically induced colitis in rats.
PG  - 639-43
AB  - We examined the effects of a human milk diet on rats with chemical colitis
      induced with a 4% acetic acid enema. Colonic myeloperoxidase activity was used as
      a surrogate marker for neutrophil infiltration. Control rats fed rat chow had
      little colonic myeloperoxidase activity; geometric mean, 0.27 U/g of tissue. Rats
      with colitis fed rat chow had significantly increased colonic myeloperoxidase
      activity (geometric mean, 6.76 U/g, p < 0.01 versus no colitis), as did rats with
      colitis fed infant formula or Pedialyte (geometric mean, 6.92 and 8.13 U/g,
      respectively, both p < 0.01 versus no colitis). Animals with colitis fed human
      milk had significantly lower colonic myeloperoxidase activity (geometric mean,
      2.34 U/g) than did animals with colitis fed either chow or infant formula (p <
      0.001). Similar effects were seen in rats with colitis fed infant formula
      supplemented with recombinant human IL-1 receptor antagonist (geometric mean,
      1.95 U/g). These data show that orally administered human milk has an
      antiinflammatory effect on chemically induced colitis in rats, which may be
      mediated in part by IL-1 receptor antagonist contained in human milk.

TI  - Double-blind comparison of an oral Escherichia coli preparation and mesalazine in
      maintaining remission of ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 853-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aminosalicylates are used as standard treatment for maintaining
      remission in ulcerative colitis. As yet, there is no other existing alternative
      with proven efficacy. In light of the hypothesis that the intestinal environment 
      may contribute to the pathophysiology of ulcerative colitis, a trial was
      conducted to test the effects of probiotic treatment with an oral preparation of 
      non-pathogenic E. coli. METHODS: A total of 120 patients with inactive ulcerative
      colitis were included in a double-blind, double-dummy study comparing mesalazine 
      500 mg t.d.s. to an oral preparation of viable E. coli strain Nissle (Serotype
      06: K5: H1) for 12 weeks with regard to their efficacy in preventing a relapse of
      the disease. Study objectives were to assess the equivalence of the clinical
      activity index (CAI) under the two treatment modalities and to compare relapse
      rates, relapse-free times and global assessment. RESULTS: The start and end
      scores of the CAI demonstrated no significant difference (P = 0.12) between the
      two treatment groups. Relapse rates were 11.3% under mesalazine and 16.0% under
      E. coli Nissle 1917 (N.S.). Life table analysis showed a relapse-free time of 103
      +/- 4 days for mesalazine and 106 +/- 5 days for E. coli Nissle 1917 (N.S.).
      Global assessment was similar for both groups. Tolerability to the treatment was 
      excellent and did not differ. No serious adverse events were reported.
      CONCLUSIONS: From the results of this preliminary study, probiotic treatment
      appears to offer another option for maintenance therapy of ulcerative colitis.
      Additional support is provided for the hypothesis of a pathophysiological role
      for the intestinal environment in ulcerative colitis.

TI  - First report of invasive amebiasis in an organ transplant recipient.
PG  - 936-7
AB  - T-cell mediated immunity is an important defense mechanism against amebiasis.
      However, organ transplant recipients with severe T-cell immunosuppression are not
      at increased risk of having Entamoeba histolytica invasive disease. The reasons
      are unclear and probably multifactorial, but it is likely that the absence of
      intestinal colonization with pathogenic strains in countries where transplants
      occur and the judicious intake of possible contaminated food and water are
      important contributing factors. We describe the first report of a liver
      transplant recipient with severe E. histolytica colitis who was successfully
      treated with metronidazole without modifying his immunosuppression therapy.

TI  - Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli isolates from cases of human disease show 
      enhanced adherence to intestinal epithelial (Henle 407) cells.
PG  - 3799-805
AB  - Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) strains are a diverse group of
      organisms which are known to cause diarrhea and hemorrhagic colitis in humans. We
      have recently described a large food-borne outbreak of STEC disease caused by
      contaminated semidry fermented sausage (A. W. Paton, R. Ratcliff, R. M. Doyle, J.
      Seymour-Murray, D. Davos, J. A. Lanser, and J. C. Paton, J. Clin. Microbiol.
      34:1622-1627, 1996). STEC strains belonging to several O serotypes were isolated 
      from the contaminated food source, but of these, only a subset were isolated from
      patients with diarrhea or hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). In the present study, 
      we characterized these STEC isolates with respect to the presence of putative
      virulence-associated genes and the capacity to adhere to a human intestinal
      epithelial cell line (Henle 407). The O111:H- STEC strain 95NR1 (isolated from
      one of the outbreak HUS patients) was shown to adhere to Henle 407 cells in a
      dose-dependent, mannose-resistant fashion. Microscopic examination revealed a
      diffuse pattern of adherence for this as well as several other STEC strains.
      Interestingly, the adherence of STEC strains from HUS cases (both outbreak
      related and sporadic) was significantly greater than that of STEC strains found
      in the contaminated food source but not found in any patients. These studies
      support the hypothesis that an enhanced capacity to adhere to intestinal cells is
      one of the factors which distinguishes human-virulent STEC strains from those of 
      lesser clinical significance.

TI  - [Nutrition in the etiopathogenesis of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases].
PG  - 637-49
AB  - It is currently held that the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      involves a complex interaction of host responses, some immunologic and
      genetically determined, and external influences including microbial and dietary
      factors. Nutritional surveys and studies testing stepwise exclusion dietary
      compounds have suggested that dietary factors might be linked to the occurrence
      of IBD. Food allergy was suggested early as a possible trigger for the
      inflammatory response; however, no firm evidence has been gathered over the years
      to substantiate this possibility. The possibility that patients with Crohn's
      disease may have an unusual premorbid pattern of dietary intake has also been
      examined since the early seventies. Several groups of investigators report a high
      intake of refined sugars (i.e. sucrose), recycled cooking oil, a more frequent
      consumption of fast foods in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis
      respectively. However, a critical comparison of incidence and prevalence studies 
      published from 1976 until 1994 clearly showed no pre-existing nutritional
      abnormality that has been identified consistently in patients who develop
      inflammatory bowel disease.

      understanding of worrying acute symptoms for the patients and too often only
      symptomatic treatment. It is also possible to take control in a more logical way 
      of illnesses that are classified as chronic and so incurable. The clinical
      examination requires great attention and much listening. Urticaria, eczema,
      rhinitis, asthma, colitis are the most frequent symptoms. More rarely, there may 
      be certain migraines or lipoid nephrosis in children.

TI  - The use of glutamine in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders in man.
PG  - 743-7
AB  - The human gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is a major site of glutamine utilisation
      accounting for more than half of the net splanchnic utilisation (approximately 15
      g/day) of glutamine obtained from the systemic circulation. Dietary glutamine
      (approximately 5 g/day) is less important than circulating glutamine, especially 
      in disease conditions associated with substantial reduction in food intake.
      Glutamine has multiple effects on the structure and function of the GIT, and
      effects in improving morbidity and mortality in animal models of GIT damage has
      led to a series of studies in man, which have produced variable results.
      Glutamine administration to treat mucositis of the upper GIT (mouth, oesophagus) 
      due to cytotoxic drug therapy, has produced no evidence of benefit. Early studies
      suggested improved healing, as do recent studies of small intestinal mucositis
      resulting from chemotherapy. Investigations in colitis are lacking although in
      experimental rat models of colitis no benefit has been reported. Multiple
      explanations can be put forward to explain the overall results, including the GIT
      distribution of enzymes involved in glutamine metabolism. Apart from the lower
      stomach in man (upper stomach in the rat) there is very little weak activity of
      glutamine synthetase, suggesting that the gut derives glutamine formed in other
      tissues and from the diet. The activity of glutaminase, which is key flux
      generating enzyme involved in glutaminolysis is very weak in mucosa with
      stratified squamous epithelium (oesophagus), where intermediate in the same
      intestine, and highest in the small intestinal mucosa which accounts for about
      80% of the total glutaminase in the entire human GIT mucosa.

AB  - S. boulardii has been investigated in Europe and the US, and preliminary reports 
      indicate that it is safe and effective in conjunction with vancomycin or
      metronidazole for the treatment of CDC, predominantly in patients who develop
      recurrence. S. boulardii in combination with vancomycin or metronidazole has not 
      been shown to be more effective than either of these agents alone for treatment
      of a first episode of CDC. In addition, S. boulardii has not been studied in
      immunocompromised patients who may be at risk for developing fungemia.
      Ultimately, large-scale clinical studies are necessary to determine whether S.
      boulardii should be routinely used to treat patients with recurrent CDC. S.
      boulardii is currently undergoing Phase III clinical trials for CDC treatment in 
      the US. Clinicians interested in information regarding participation in current
      studies may contact Biocodex Inc., in Seattle, Washington.

OAB - A dysentery outbreak in the Central African Republic village of Zemio was
      diagnosed as "Shigella flexneri" by the Pasteur Institute in Bangui (IPB) in
      February 1996; 2 months later there was an outbreak of hemorrhagic colitis. 108
      patients presented with bloody diarrhea; cramping abdominal pain, fever, nausea, 
      and vomiting were uncommon. The illness lasted between 5 days and 3 weeks
      (average, 8 days). Antibiotics were ineffective. Four patients died and several
      developed hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Stool cultures done at IPB tested negative. 
      PCR was used to detect enterohemorrhagic Shiga-like toxin (SLT) 1 and 2, the
      invasivity gene ipaH, and the attaching and effacing gene eaeA. DNA fragments of 
      130 and 494 nucleotides corresponding to amplified SLT1 and eaeA were found in
      80% of the specimens tested. No amplification was obtained for SLT2 or for ipaH
      in specimens collected during the second epidemic. These results suggest the
      presence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and the absence of Shigella. The
      number of reported cases of acute bloody diarrhea in infants and adults in Bangui
      has increased since 1996. E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from two fatal adult
      cases. Smoked zebu meat was suspected in several hospital cases (bloody diarrhea,
      hemolytic anemia, and renal insufficiency) in which non-fermenting sorbitol E.
      coli O157:H7 was not isolated. In two cases of acute diarrhea, other serotypes of
      E. coli were indicated by retrospective PCR on stools which were positive for
      SLT1 and for eaeA and negative for invasivity. A study was conducted in Bangui on
      290 cases (33 with bloody diarrhea) and 140 controls. Patients were not paired
      because of civil unrest in the city. The questionnaire included demographic and
      socioeconomic characteristics, environmental factors, and habitual food
      consumption. The major contributing factor was consumption of locally made meat
      pies (kanda), which were made with smoked zebu meat. Kanda is stored at ambient
      temperature, often for days, before it is sold in markets or along roads. Before 
      1996, E. coli was not reported as a cause of bloody diarrhea in the Central
      African Republic.

TI  - [Clinical signs of food allergy].
PG  - 165-8
AB  - To investigate the clinical signs of food allergy is to open new horizons for the
      understanding of worrying acute symptoms for the patients and too often only
      symptomatic treatment. It is also possible to take control in a more logical way 
      of illnesses that are classified as chronic and so incurable. The clinical
      examination requires great attention and much listening. Urticaria, eczema,
      rhinitis, asthma, colitis are the most frequent symptoms. More rarely, there may 
      be certain migranes or lipoid nephrosis in children.

TI  - South Asians with ulcerative colitis exhibit altered lectin binding compared with
      matched European cases.
PG  - 469-77
AB  - Ulcerative colitis is associated with abnormalities of mucin synthesis and
      secretion, features that may also be associated with malignant change. It has
      been shown that South Asians in Britain have a high incidence of ulcerative
      colitis but a low incidence of colorectal carcinoma compared with their European 
      counterparts. Previous studies have demonstrated changes in colonic mucin
      sialylation and sulphation in both South Asian and European cases with ulcerative
      colitis. This was related to disease severity, but changes were also found in
      quiescent disease. The aim of the present study was to determine glycoconjugate
      expression in the colon from South Asian cases and to compare results with those 
      from a group of affected Europeans. Glycans were identified in formalin-fixed,
      paraffin-embedded tissue from 17 South Asian patients with ulcerative colitis and
      from 11 European patients with a similar degree of colitis, by the application of
      10 biotinylated lectins. These were directed against a range of sialyl, fucosyl
      and 2-deoxy, 2-acetamido-galactosyl sequences, using an avidin-peroxidase
      revealing system and semiquantitative assessment. The South Asian group showed a 
      reduction in the binding of agglutinins from Sambucus nigra in the
      apical-membranous region of enterocytes, and a decrease in apical Maackia
      amurensis agglutinin binding. These results suggest that South Asians with
      ulcerative colitis show a different distribution of terminal N-acetyl neuraminyl 
      residues, either in their alpha-2,6 or alpha-2,3 linkage, compared with their
      European counterparts. The changes in sialylation observed in European cases
      compared with normal disease-free control subjects were present in quiescent
      disease, but were also related to disease activity. Their absence in Asians with 
      ulcerative colitis may imply an inherent, genetically determined variation in
      this group, which may also play a part in their reduced risk of subsequent
      malignancy.

TI  - Pre-illness dietary factors in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 754-60
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of environmental factors has been demonstrated in the
      pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Nutrition may be one of them.
      AIM: To investigate the pre-illness diet in patients with recent IBD in
      comparison with matched population and clinic controls. METHODS: Quantified
      dietary histories were obtained from 87 patients with recent IBD (54 ulcerative
      colitis (UC) and 33 Crohn's disease (CD)) and 144 controls. Odds ratios (OR) for 
      IBD were derived for intake levels of various foods. RESULTS: A high sucrose
      consumption was associated with an increased risk for IBD (OR 2.85 (p = 0.03)
      against population controls and 5.3 (p = 0.00) against clinic controls). Lactose 
      consumption showed no effect while fructose intake was negatively associated with
      risk for IBD (NS). Similar trends were noted in UC and CD. A high fat intake was 
      associated with an increased risk for UC; this was particularly marked for animal
      fat (OR 4.09, p = 0.02) and cholesterol (OR 4.57, p = 0.02). A high intake of
      fluids (p = 0.04), magnesium (p = 0.04), vitamin C, and fruits (NS) was
      negatively associated with the risk for IBD, while a positive association was
      found for retinol (p = 0.01). Most of the findings were similar in UC and CD
      except for potassium and vegetable consumption which showed a negative
      association only with risk for CD. CONCLUSIONS: An association was found between 
      pre-illness diet and subsequent development of UC and CD. The effect of dietary
      components may be primary or modulatory.

TI  - Self-reported food intolerance in chronic inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 569-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although suggested, it has never been convincingly documented that
      food sensitivity is of pathogenetic importance in chronic inflammatory bowel
      disease. However, many patients may relate their gastrointestinal symptoms to
      specific food items ingested and may restrict their diet accordingly. METHODS: A 
      questionnaire was sent to all patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease
      who attended the outpatient clinic, Medical Dept., Roskilde County Hospital in
      Koge, Denmark, in the year 1993. The patients were asked whether they had
      problems with any particular food item and, if so, to describe the symptoms
      experienced from it. A control group of 70 healthy persons were included.
      RESULTS: Among 189 patients, 132 (70%) responded. One hundred and thirty had
      completed the questionnaire, 52 males and 78 females aged 13-89 years (median, 43
      years). Fifty-three (41%) had Crohn's disease (CD), 69 (53%) ulcerative colitis
      (UC), and 8 (6%) unclassified colitis. Forty-one patients (31 CD, 10 UC)
      were-operated on; 51 (19 CD, 32 UC) had disease activity. Sixty-five per cent of 
      the patients and 14% of the controls reported being intolerant to one or more
      food items (P < 0.0001). The intolerance covered a wide range of food products.
      The commonest symptoms among patients were diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and
      meteorism and among controls, regurgitation. Food intolerance was equally common 
      in CD (66%) and UC (64%) and was not related to previous operation, disease
      activity or disease location. CONCLUSION: Most patients with chronic inflammatory
      bowel intolerance disease feel intolerant to different food items and may
      restrict their diet accordingly. The frequency and pattern of food intolerance
      did not differ between patients with CD and UC. The food intolerance was probably
      unspecific rather than of pathogenetic importance.

TI  - Recovery of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG from human colonic biopsies.
PG  - 361-4
AB  - The colonization of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (ATCC 53103, henceforth L.GG) in
      five human colonoscopy patients was studied. The test subjects consumed whey
      drink fermented with the bacterium for 12 d before the colonoscopy. The presence 
      of L.GG was subsequently checked both in the faecal samples and in the colonic
      biopsies obtained from various locations in the large intestine. In all patients 
      L.GG was the dominant faecal lactic acid bacterium as a result of the
      administration. In four patients L.GG could also be recovered from the biopsies, 
      while with one patient (suffering from ulcerative colitis diagnosed during the
      colonoscopy) no L.GG was detected in the biopsy samples. The results suggest that
      L.GG is able to adhere in vivo to the colon. Study of the faecal samples alone is
      apparently not sufficient for elucidation of the gastrointestinal ecology of
      probiotic bacteria.

TI  - Banana flakes control diarrhea in enterally fed patients.
PG  - 72-5
AB  - Diarrhea occurs frequently in the critically ill tube-fed population and may
      result from a multitude of causes. Despite the availability of antidiarrheal
      medications, diarrhea associated with enteral feedings remains a problem for
      clinicians and for the patients affected by it. We tested the hypothesis that
      administration of banana flakes would control diarrhea in critically ill patients
      receiving enteral feedings. Thirty-one patients with diarrhea and receiving
      enteral feedings were randomized to receive either banana flakes or medical
      treatment for diarrhea. Medical treatments included the use of pharmacological
      agents according to the discretion of the patient's physician or reducing feeding
      rates. Both banana flakes and medical treatments reduced the severity of diarrhea
      in critically ill tube-fed patients. Over the course of treatment, mean diarrhea 
      scores were 21.64 +/- 7.81 for the banana flake group and 25.41 +/- 9.76 for the 
      medical group. These differences were not statistically significant. Both groups 
      achieved similar levels of nutrition support. The banana flake group had less
      diarrhea clinically, with 57% of the subjects diarrhea free on their last study
      day as opposed to 24% of the medically treated subjects. This occurred despite a 
      threefold increase in the number of patients testing positive for Clostridium
      difficile toxin in the banana flake group. We conclude that banana flakes can be 
      used as a safe, cost-effective treatment for diarrhea in critically ill tube-fed 
      patients. Banana flakes can be given concurrently with a workup for C. difficile 
      colitis, thereby expediting treatment of diarrhea.

AB  - We assessed consumption of fruit and vegetables amongst patients with ulcerative 
      colitis, colorectal polyps or previous carcinoma. The dietary intakes for 119
      patients attending a gastroenterology clinic for colonoscopy were assessed using 
      a questionnaire. A single age- and sex-matched control subject was recruited for 
      each patient. The patients consumed 12.8% less energy than the controls (P <
      0.02) and 28.9% less fruit and vegetables (P < 0.0001). Patients with neoplastic 
      disease consumed 21% less fruit and vegetables than the controls (n = 60; P <
      0.01). This group of patients at increased risk of colorectal cancer selected
      diets containing significantly less fruit and vegetables than symptomless
      controls.

TI  - Nutrition and ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 153-74
AB  - The role of diet in the aetiology and pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC)
      remains uncertain. Impaired utilization by colonocytes of butyrate, a product of 
      bacterial fermentation of dietary carbohydrates escaping digestion, may be
      important. Sulphur-fermenting bacteria may be involved in this impaired
      utilization. Oxidative stress probably mediates tissue injury but is probably not
      of causative importance. Patients with UC are prone to malnutrition and its
      detrimental effects. However, there is no role for total parenteral nutrition and
      bowel rest as primary therapy for UC. The maintenance of adequate nutrition is
      very important, particularly in the peri-operative patient. In the absence of
      massive bleeding, perforation, toxic megacolon or obstruction, enteral rather
      than parenteral nutrition should be the mode of choice. Nutrients may be
      beneficial as adjuvant therapy. Butyrate enemas have improved patients with
      otherwise recalcitrant distal colitis in small studies. Non-cellulose fibre
      supplements are of benefit in rats with experimental colitis. Eicosapentaenoic
      acid in fish oil has a steroid-sparing effect which, although modest, is
      important, particularly in terms of reducing the risk of osteoporosis, but it
      seems to have no role in the patient with inactive disease. gamma-Linolenic acid 
      and anti-oxidants also are showing promise. Nutrients may also modify the
      increased risk of colorectal carcinoma. Oxidative stress can damage tissue DNA
      but there are no data published at present on possible protection from oral
      anti-oxidants. Butyrate protects against experimental carcinogenesis in rats with
      experimental colitis. Folate supplementation is weakly associated with decreased 
      incidence of cancer in UC patients when assessed retrospectively. Vigilance
      should be maintained for increased micronutrient requirements and supplements
      given as appropriate. Calcium and low-dose vitamin D should be given to patients 
      on long-term steroids and folate to those on sulphasalazine.

AB  - Using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis(PFGE) with XbaI digestion, we analyzed
      1,794 enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli(EHEC) O157 isolates, which were derived 
      from 16 outbreaks, sporadic cases, foods, beef fecal swabs, and environments in
      1996 in Japan. They were classified into six types according to observed PFGE
      patterns. EHEC O157:H7 isolates from seven out of the 16 outbreaks showed very
      closely related patterns and those from other five outbreaks did the same
      pattern; in the former outbreaks, no common source could be identified, while in 
      the latter outbreaks, radish sprout is thought to be the common cause of the
      infection. PFGE patterns of the remaining four outbreaks were not correlated to
      each other.

AB  - The relationships between non-specific inflammatory bowel disease and nutrition
      is considered. One of the hypotheses holds that environmental factors, especially
      those in dietary intake, can be the initiators of intestinal inflammation. In
      this connection authors examined a group of patients suffering from Crohns
      disease and ulcerative colitis. Results observed in patients with Crohns disease 
      indicate: preferred consumption of flour products, decreased intake of vegetables
      and fruit, lowered tolerance to milk and milk products, increased sugar
      consumption, increased proportion of smokers, no differences in diet regimen
      between nick and healthy subjects. (Tab. 3, Ref. 16.)

TI  - Non-O157 Vero cytotoxin producing Escherichia coli: aetiological agents of
      diarrhoea in children in Dunedin, New Zealand.
PG  - 163-70
AB  - Strains of Escherichia coli that produce Vero cytotoxin (VTEC) commonly cause
      diarrhoea, haemorrhagic colitis and haemolytic-uraemic syndrome in many northern 
      hemisphere countries. In these countries, serotype O157:H7/H-predominates and has
      caused large food-borne outbreaks of infection. In contrast, few cases of
      infection with this serotype have been reported in New Zealand. Over a 3-month
      period, 484 stool specimens submitted to medical laboratories in Dunedin were
      screened for E. coli O157:H7/H-using sorbitol MacConkey agar, Y1 and Vero cell
      assays. Where possible, Vero cytotoxin production was confirmed by an ELISA test.
      Specimens from children aged 12 years or less were additionally screened for
      non-O157 VTEC. In the specimens of the children tested, O157:H7/H-VTEC was not
      isolated, but VTEC belonging to other serogroups were isolated from the children.
      Of interest was the detection of other species of Enterobacteriaceae, which
      produced a cytopathic effect on Vero cells. This study confirms the low incidence
      of infection with O157:H7/H- VTEC in New Zealand and suggests that non-O157 VTEC 
      is a more important cause of diarrhoeal disease.

TI  - Quantification of inflammatory mediators in stool samples of patients with
      inflammatory bowel disorders and controls.
PG  - 394-403
AB  - Previous studies indicated that eosinophils and mast cells accumulate and become 
      activated in inflammatory bowel disorders. The aim of the study was to examine
      the presence of eosinophil and mast cell mediators in human stool samples of
      patients with inflammatory bowel disorders. We measured eosinophil cationic
      protein (ECP), eosinophil protein X (EPX), methylhistamine, and alpha
      1-antitrypsin in fecal samples of 136 patients (62 Crohn's disease, 24 ulcerative
      colitis, 15 intestinal food allergy, 35 other gastrointestinal diseases) and 8
      healthy controls. We found strongly elevated levels of ECP (median: 29, range:
      0.4-1783 ng/g feces) and EPX (803, 10-33,225 ng/g) in all patients groups
      compared to controls (ECP: 1.5, 0.5-55 ng/g; EPX: 235, 12-746 ng/g). Similar
      results, albeit less pronounced, were obtained for methylhistamine and alpha
      1-antitrypsin. Particularly high concentrations of ECP and EPX were found in
      patients with active mucosal inflammation. In conclusion, the study presents an
      easy and reliable method for the detection of fecal ECP, EPX, and methylhistamine
      and may provide a tool to gain insight into the pathogenesis of inflammatory
      bowel diseases and have potential as diagnostic test.

AB  - Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli produces Verotoxins (Shiga-like toxins) and
      causes diarrhoea, haemorrhagic colitis and haemorrhagic uraemic syndrome. The
      mode of action of the Shiga toxin family has been well characterized in numerous 
      studies which have demonstrated that the toxin has RNA N-glycosidase activity,
      which inhibits the binding of EF-1-dependent aminoacyl-tRNA to the 60S ribosomal 
      subunit of eukaryotic cells, thus resulting in an inhibition of protein synthesis
      of the cells. In 1996, an unexpectedly large number of outbreaks of food
      poisoning due to E. coli O157:H7 occurred in Japan. In addition, many sporadic
      cases of E. coli O157:H7 were also reported and a total of about 8400 patients
      were recorded during that year. In most of these cases, the food vectors could
      not be identified. The possibility of developing a candidate vaccine is also
      discussed in this article.

TI  - Variation in virulence in the gnotobiotic pig model of O157:H7 Escherichia coli
      strains of bovine and human origin.
PG  - 53-8
AB  - Escherichia coli strains of serotype O157:H7 have been incriminated in outbreaks 
      and sporadic cases of food-borne illness, including diarrhea, hemorrhagic
      colitis, hemolytic uremic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
      Food-producing animals, particularly cattle, are believed to be reservoirs of the
      organism. Whether all strains of bovine origin pose human health risk is unknown 
      and was the impetus for this investigation. We compared the virulence of ten
      SLT-I, SLT-II, and eae DNA probe-positive O157:H7 strains from cattle to 10 like 
      strains associated with human diarrheal disease outbreaks for virulence in one
      day-old gnotobiotic pigs. All strains caused diarrhea, and only four pigs
      inoculated with either of two bovine strains failed to develop that condition.
      Signs of central nervous system disease, death, debilitation requiring euthanasia
      before the end of an eight day observation period, and/or encephalomalacia
      occurred in 32/42 pigs inoculated with the strains isolated from human beings,
      13/39 pigs inoculated with strains from cattle, and 7/7 pigs inoculated with a
      positive control strain. More strains of human origin (9/10) than bovine origin
      (5/10) caused these effects. The results of this study indicate considerable
      variability in virulence of O157:H7 strains possessing the same known virulence
      determinants, and suggest that disease outbreaks tend to be caused by the more
      virulent of these strains.

TI  - Inulin and oligofructose do not influence the absorption of cholesterol, or the
      excretion of cholesterol, Ca, Mg, Zn, Fe, or bile acids but increases energy
      excretion in ileostomy subjects.
PG  - 1-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of inulin and oligofructose on cholesterol 
      absorption and excretion of cholesterol, bile acids, energy, nitrogen and
      minerals in man. DESIGN: Double-blind cross-over study. SETTING: Metabolic
      kitchen with policlinic visits, Sahlgrenska Hospital, Goteborg, Sweden. SUBJECTS:
      Patients with conventional ileostomy because of ulcerative colitis.
      INTERVENTIONS: 7 g of inulin, 17 g of oligofructose and 7 g of sucrose were added
      to a controlled diet during three experimental periods of three days each.
      Ileostomy effluents were collected and analysed. Differences between experimental
      and control diet were investigated with the Wilcoxon's sign and values test.
      RESULTS: Inulin and oligofructose were recovered in the ileostomy effluent to 88%
      (95% CI, 76-100%) and 89% (64-114%) respectively. Dry solid excretion increased
      by 14.4 g (11.3-17.5) on inulin, and by 14.7 g (13.0-16.4 g) on oligofructose and
      energy excretion increased 245 kJ (190-307 kJ) on inulin and 230 kJ (214-315 kJ) 
      on oligofructose compared to control diet (P < 0.05). Cholesterol absorption,
      excretion of cholesterol, bile acids, nitrogen, fat, calcium, magnesium, zinc and
      iron were not affected by inulin and oligofructose. CONCLUSIONS: Inulin and
      oligofructose are not digested in the small intestine. They do not affect mineral
      excretion and hence hardly mineral absorption. They do not increase fat or
      nitrogen excretion from the small intestine. Any physiological effect of inulin
      and oligofructose is probably mediated through other mechanisms than altered
      excretion from the small intestine.

TI  - Pectin and methyl cellulose do not affect intestinal function in patients after
      ileal pouch-anal anastomosis.
PG  - 99-102
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is the procedure of choice for 
      most patients with ulcerative colitis or familial adenomatous polyposis, most
      patients have problems with stool frequency and/or consistency. Although most
      clinicians recommend fiber supplementation for these patients, we could find no
      studies that prove the efficacy of this practice. The first purpose of this study
      was to document the effect of fiber supplementation on intestinal function in
      patients after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. Because pectin, a soluble fiber
      supplement, has been reported to slow gastric and intestinal transit, we also
      hypothesized that pectin would be a superior fiber supplement in these patients. 
      The second purpose, therefore, was to determine whether the effects of pectin on 
      intestinal transit would result in decreased stool frequency in patients with an 
      ileal pouch. METHODS: Thirteen patients who had undergone ileal pouch-anal
      anastomosis for ulcerative colitis were entered into a 9-wk crossover study. The 
      protocol consisted of three 2-wk study periods, each of which was preceded by a
      1-wk washout period. During the three study periods patients supplemented their
      diets, in random order, with Citrucel, 1 tablespoon twice daily; pectin, 1
      tablespoon twice daily; or no supplement. Patients maintained detailed dietary
      and bowel function diaries. RESULTS: The effects (mean +/- SE) of Citrucel and
      pectin supplementation are summarized in Table 1. There was no significant effect
      of either supplement on stool frequency, pouch function, bloating, or stool
      consistency. In addition, there were no differences in continence. CONCLUSIONS:
      We found no evidence to support the common practice of fiber supplementation in
      patients with an ileal pouch. Furthermore, this study did not find that stool
      frequency decreased during supplementation with pectin. We conclude that there is
      little role for fiber supplementation in patients with an ileal pouch.
