AB  - Emerging infectious diseases such as prolonged diarrheal illness due to
      water-borne Cryptosporidium, hemorrhagic colitis and renal failure from
      food-borne E. coli O157:H7, and rodent-borne hantavirus pulmonary syndrome as
      well as reemerging infections such as tuberculosis, pertussis, and cholera
      vividly illustrate that we remain highly vulnerable to the microorganisms with
      which we share our environment. Prompt detection of new and resurgent infectious 
      disease threats depends on careful monitoring by modern surveillance systems.
      This article focuses on five important elements of improved surveillance for
      emerging infections: 1) strengthening the national notifiable disease system, 2) 
      establishing sentinel surveillance networks, 3) establishing population-based
      emerging infections programs, 4) developing a system for enhanced global
      surveillance, and 5) applying new tools and novel approaches to surveillance.

TI  - Mechanisms of decreased food intake during weight loss in adult Crohn's disease
      patients without obvious malabsorption.
PG  - 775-81
AB  - Because weight loss is common in colonic Crohn's disease and is poorly correlated
      with disease activity, we analyzed food intake in 63 patients without
      malabsorption, 30 patients with weight loss (9.2 +/- 4.2 kg), and 33 patients
      without weight loss. Energy and protein intakes were lower in patients with
      weight loss than in those with stable weight (P < 0.01). In the former group,
      food restrictions were more numerous (P < 0.01) and visual analog scales showed
      less hunger, decreased appetite, and fewer sensations of pleasure related to
      eating, as compared with the other group (P < 0.01). Food intake reduction was
      also related to depressive mood and medical advice. However, there was no
      difference between groups in fecal energy wasting and resting energy expenditure.
      Weight loss in Crohn's disease may be due to a decrease in food intake rather
      than to an increase in energy cost of the disease. Thus, focus of attention on
      the diet is crucial to prevent malnutrition.

      Britain.
PG  - 304-7
AB  - Vero cytotoxin (VT)-producing Escherichia coli O157 (O157 VTEC) were isolated
      from a raw beefburger obtained from a retail source linked to a small community
      outbreak of O157 VTEC infection in Wales. Strains from the meat and from seven of
      eight patients belonged to phage type 49 and were indistinguishable by their
      VT-type, plasmid content and hybridization with DNA of a VT-encoding phage from
      an O157 VTEC strain. This first report of the isolation of O157 VTEC from a beef 
      product in Britain supports the view that there is a bovine reservoir for this
      organism.

TI  - Escherichia coli O 157:H7-associated hemolytic-uremic syndrome after ingestion of
      contaminated hamburgers.
PG  - 519-26
AB  - We conducted a retrospective analysis of 37 children with Escherichia coli
      O157:H7-associated hemolytic-uremic syndrome. The infection was traced to
      contaminated hamburgers at a fast-food restaurant chain. Within 5 days of the
      first confirmed case, the Washington State Department of Health identified the
      source and interrupted transmission of infection. Ninety-five percent of the
      children initially had severe hemorrhagic colitis. Nineteen patients (51%) had
      significant extrarenal abnormalities, including pancreatitis, colonic necrosis,
      glucose intolerance, coma, stroke, seizures, myocardial dysfunction, pericardial 
      effusions, adult respiratory disease syndrome, and pleural effusions. Three
      deaths occurred, each in children with severe multisystem disease. At follow-up
      two children have significant impairment of renal function (glomerular filtration
      rate < 80 ml/min/per 1.73 Hm2); both of these children have a normal serum
      creatinine concentration. Hemolytic-uremic syndrome is the most common cause of
      acute renal failure in children, and this experience emphasizes the systemic
      nature of this disease. Clinicians should anticipate that multisystem involvement
      may occur in these patients, necessitating acute intervention or chronic
      follow-up. This outbreak of Hemolytic-uremic syndrome also highlights the
      microbiologic hazards of inadequately prepared food and emphasizes the importance
      of public health intervention in controlling Hemolytic-uremic syndrome.

PG  - 742-8
AB  - Colonic SCFA formation from fermentable carbohydrate is important for the
      maintenance of morphologic and functional integrity of the colonic epithelium.
      Carbohydrate-induced diarrhea occurs when the amount of carbohydrate entering the
      colon exceeds its fermentation capacity. Deficient availability or utilization of
      SCFA, mainly of n-butyrate, is the cause of diversion colitis and may play
      important roles in colonic carcinogenesis, in starvation and enterotoxigenic
      diarrhea, and in idiopathic UC.

TI  - A swimming-associated outbreak of hemorrhagic colitis caused by Escherichia coli 
      O157:H7 and Shigella sonnei.
PG  - 579-84
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the summer of 1991, simultaneous outbreaks of bloody diarrhea and 
      hemolytic-uremic syndrome caused by Escherichia coli O157:H7 and of bloody
      diarrhea caused by Shigella sonnei were traced to a lakeside park near Portland, 
      Oregon. METHODS: We identified cases primarily from routine surveillance reports.
      In case-control studies, the activities of persons with park-associated E. coli
      O157:H7 or S. sonnei infections were compared independently with those of three
      sets of controls. We also evaluated environmental conditions at the park and
      subtyped the bacterial isolates. RESULTS: We identified 21 persons with
      park-associated E. coli O157:H7 infections (all of them children; median age, six
      years) and 38 persons with S. sonnei infections (most of them children). These 59
      people had visited the park over a 24-day period. Their illnesses were not
      associated with food or beverage consumption. All the case patients reported
      swimming, however, and in case-control studies swimming was strongly associated
      with both types of infection (P = 0.015 or less). The case patients were more
      likely than the controls to report having swallowed lake water, and they had
      spent more time in the lake. Numbers of enterococci indicative of substantial
      fecal contamination (geometric mean, > 50 per deciliter) were detected in the
      swimming area during some but not all of the outbreak period. Park-associated E. 
      coli O157:H7 isolates were identical by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and were
      distinguishable from other isolates in the Portland area. CONCLUSIONS: Lake water
      that was fecally contaminated by bathers was the most likely vehicle for the
      transmission of both the E. coli O157:H7 and the S. sonnei infections. The
      unusually prolonged outbreak suggests both the survival of these enteric
      organisms in lake water and a low infectious dose.

      in Japan.
PG  - 166-71
AB  - A multisite, hospital-based, case-control study examined the risk of ulcerative
      colitis in relation to dietary factors, smoking and drinking habits, past history
      of diseases, and childhood factors. Information was obtained from
      self-administered patient questionnaires. Study subjects included 101 ulcerative 
      colitis patients who were 10-39 years old at the time of disease onset, which was
      within the previous 3 years, and 143 control subjects. Combined consumption of
      Western foods (bread for breakfast, butter, margarine, cheese, meats, and ham and
      sausage) was significantly related to an increased risk of ulcerative colitis
      (trend, p = 0.04). Margarine (as an individual Western food item) was positively 
      associated with ulcerative colitis (trend, p = 0.005). There was also a tendency 
      toward positive association of bread for breakfast with ulcerative colitis
      (trend, p = 0.07). The risk did not measurably vary with the consumption of
      typical Japanese foods, vegetables and fruits, confectioneries, or soft drinks.
      As compared with lifelong nonsmokers, current smokers tended to have a decreased 
      risk of ulcerative colitis and former smokers had an increased risk. There was no
      association between breastfeeding in infancy and the risk of ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Allergic colitis in infancy: clinical and pathologic aspects.
PG  - 22-6
AB  - This study prospectively evaluated 35 consecutive infants who presented with
      fresh blood mixed with stools. The mean age at onset of bleeding was
      approximately 4 weeks. All infants were otherwise asymptomatic and exhibited
      normal growth and physical examinations. None had evidence of a bleeding
      diathesis, viral or bacterial enteritis, or necrotizing enterocolitis. Consent
      for limited colonoscopy and biopsy was obtained for 34 infants. Twenty-five had
      macroscopic colitis and 10 infants had marked nodular lymphoid hyperplasia.
      Thirty-one infants had histopathological evidence of colitis characterized by a
      marked eosinophilic infiltrate. Compared with 19 controls (age, 4.1 +/- 3.6
      months) the mean number of eosinophils per high-power field was greater in the
      patients with colitis. Patients with colitis also had an elevated mean absolute
      peripheral eosinophil count and a low mean serum albumin compared to control
      values. The 31 infants with colitis were receiving solely breast milk (10), cow's
      milk formula (9), soya formula (9), breast milk with cow's milk formula (2), or
      nutramigen (1) at the time of presentation. Nineteen infants had rapid resolution
      of frank bleeding and gradual correction of serum albumin with dietary change.
      While limited colonoscopy and biopsy were useful in establishing a definitive
      diagnosis, a low serum albumin and high peripheral eosinophil count suggested the
      diagnosis. Colitis characterized histologically by > 20 eosinophils per
      high-power field is a common cause of rectal bleeding in otherwise healthy young 
      infants. Resolution of bleeding and increase in serum albumin after dietary
      change suggest that this is an allergic colitis: however, the pathogenesis of
      this disorder needs further clarification.

TI  - The effect of proctocolectomy on serum antibody levels against cow's milk
      proteins in patients with chronic ulcerative colitis, with special reference to
      liver changes.
PG  - 646-50
AB  - BACKGROUND: The levels of antibodies against cow's milk proteins in ulcerative
      colitis (UC) were used to study whether mucosal inflammation leads to immune
      recognition, as a marker of enhanced permeability, of dietary proteins. A further
      purpose was to study the effect of proctocolectomy on the serum antibody levels
      against cow's milk proteins and their relation to biochemical and histologic
      liver abnormalities associated with ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Serum antibody
      levels against six cow's milk proteins, alpha-casein, alpha-lactalbumin (LA),
      beta-lactoglobulin A (LGA), beta-lactoglobulin B (LGB), bovine serum albumin
      (BSA), and whole milk powder (MP) were determined before and after (mean, 24
      months) proctocolectomy in 15 patients with ulcerative colitis. Simultaneously,
      serum liver enzymes were analyzed. A liver biopsy specimen was also obtained at
      proctocolectomy. RESULTS: Before proctocolectomy IgA antibody levels were
      significantly increased against all antigens except BSA. Increased levels of IgM 
      antibodies against LGA, LGB, and BSA were also detected. IgG antibodies were
      significantly increased only against LGA. After proctocolectomy IgA and IgM
      antibody levels decreased significantly (p < 0.05) against LGA, LGB, and LA,
      whereas IgG antibodies increased significantly (p < 0.01). In the patient group
      with abnormal liver histology (n = 9) the IgA antibodies to all cow's milk
      proteins were significantly higher (p < 0.02) than in the group with normal liver
      histology both before and after proctocolectomy. The IgA antibody levels showed a
      significant positive correlation with alanine amino-transferase and
      gamma-glutamyltransferase (r value from 0.460 to 0.721, p value from < 0.05 to < 
      0.01), but not with alkaline phosphatase. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that
      the inflamed mucosa in UC allows the antigenic contents of the bowel to escape.
      Proctocolectomy alters the antibody levels against certain milk proteins, which
      may serve as a model to suggest that proctocolectomy, probably by eliminating
      inflammation, may have positive effects by reducing the foreign pathogenic
      antigen and immune complex load.

      replication in humans.
PG  - 337-44
AB  - Abnormal intestinal crypt cell proliferation is considered to be an important
      early risk marker for colorectal cancer but measurement of the rate and spatial
      distribution of cell division by histochemical localization of DNA synthesis is
      labour-intensive and expensive. We developed and evaluated a simpler technique
      for measurement of these parameters using direct visual analysis of mitotic
      figures in microdissected crypts. The direct crypt analysis technique was applied
      to colorectal biopsies from patients with ulcerative colitis or no mucosal
      abnormality. A characteristic shift of cell division toward the intestinal lumen 
      was detected in patients with ulcerative colitis. The direct method was validated
      using rats fed diets containing cellulose, or guar gum to stimulate mucosal cell 
      proliferation. The crypt cell proliferation rate (CCPR) was measured by the
      metaphase-arrest technique and the results were compared with direct crypt
      analysis. There was a fivefold range of CCPR values at three sampling sites
      across the dietary groups. An excellent linear correlation between the results by
      the two techniques was obtained (r = 0.98; P < 0.001). In a second experiment the
      spatial distribution of dividing cells between five zones in colonic crypts,
      determined by the new method or by staining with BrdU, was compared. Good
      agreement was again achieved. Visual analysis of intact crypts is a valid
      technique for the measurement of crypt cell cytokinetics and it is particularly
      suited for use in a clinical environment.

      treatment.
PG  - 157-61
LID - 10.1093/tropej/40.3.157 [doi]
AB  - One-hundred-twenty infants under 1 year of age suffering from intractable
      diarrhoea were studied. They had received prior treatment in the form of
      antimicrobials (100 per cent), stool binding substance (50 percent), antimotility
      agents (50 per cent), and intravenous (IV) fluids (33 per cent). One-third of
      them had been hospitalised in peripheral hospitals. All of them had diarrhoea of 
      more than 2 weeks' duration, protein energy malnutrition and were very ill. In
      addition vomiting, dehydration, fever, paralytic ileus, perianal excoriation and 
      rectal prolapse were present in 44, 23, 33, 9, 47, and 3 per cent of the infants,
      respectively. Anaemia, multiple vitamin deficiencies, and pedal oedema were seen 
      in 70, 10, and 3 per cent of infants, respectively. The infections documented
      were septicaemia (22 per cent), bronchopneumonia (6 per cent), meningitis (4 per 
      cent), urinary tract infection (3 per cent) and acute supporative otitis media in
      2 per cent of infants. Fifty-three per cent of infants had secondary lactose
      intolerance. Intolerance to milk protein, milk protein and soyabean and milk
      protein, as well as soyabean and chicken was seen in 4, 2, and 1 per cent cases, 
      respectively. Aetiological agents isolated from stool culture were E. coli, (18
      per cent), Klebsiella species (9 per cent), Shigella species (6 per cent),
      Salmonella typhimurium (2 per cent), Cholera mitschikom (1 per cent), Giardia
      lamblia (6 per cent), cryptosporidium (1 per cent), and E. histolytica (1 per
      cent). Candida albicans was grown in 18 per cent of infants. Pseudomembranous
      colitis was documented in 2 per cent cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Current concepts in the management of the irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 127-32
AB  - In the irritable bowel syndrome gastrointestinal tract motility is disturbed from
      the esophagus to the colon, causing pain and altered function. When colonic
      motility is abnormal, the patient can experience either constipation or diarrhea 
      in addition to abdominal pain and bloating. In constipated patients the
      postprandial colonic motility can increase normally after eating or the colon can
      remain motionless. Generally propagating contractions are absent in patients with
      constipation predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Propagating contractions are
      increased in frequency in patients with diarrhea, although the phasic
      contractions are decreased. Questionnaires discriminate between patients with
      structural disease such as ulcerative colitis and patients with functional
      disease, however they cannot differentiate between the different subgroups of
      patients with constipation predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Treatment
      strategies are beginning to focus on the underlying pathophysiologic abnormality.

TI  - [Diagnostic guidelines in diarrhea].
PG  - 166-71
AB  - Acute diarrhea is usually short-lasting; therefore, diagnostic procedures are
      mainly concerning the degree of dehydration. With longer duration of high fever
      or bloody diarrhea, microbiologic stool tests are necessary. Proctosigmoidoscopy 
      is indicated in case of dysenteric disease or suspected antibiotic-as-associated 
      pseudomembranous colitis. In chronic diarrhea, the most important diagnostic
      procedure is a careful history. Side effects of drugs and food-related causes are
      especially noticeable, as are indices of an organic origin, e.g. unwanted weight 
      loss or blood in the stools. Also, careful history and physical examination are
      essential for the decision about laboratory tests, tests of gastrointestinal
      function or endoscopy.

TI  - Amino acid losses in ileostomy fluid on a protein-free diet.
PG  - 70-3
AB  - The contribution of losses via the gastrointestinal tract to maintenance amino
      acid requirements was assessed by collecting the ileostomy fluid of volunteers
      given a protein-free diet for 5 d. The subjects were eight adult men and women
      with terminal ileum ileostomies after ulcerative colitis. Four consecutive 24-h
      collections of both digesta and urine were made. On the last 2 d an antibiotic
      was given that suppressed microbial activity in the digesta and slightly reduced 
      ileostomy outflow. Mean daily amino acid excretion in ileostomy fluid ranged from
      32 mg/d for methionine to approximately 330 mg/d for aspartate and glutamate.
      These losses were compared with current international estimates of amino acid
      requirements. For most essential amino acids gastrointestinal losses accounted
      for 14-33% of daily maintenance requirements but for threonine the contribution
      was 61%.

      were examined for the presence of plasmids and for the ability to adhere to HEp-2
      and Intestine 407 cells. All of the strains possessed a common 60-MDa plasmid. To
      determine the role of the 60-MDa plasmid, plasmid-cured strains were compared
      with the parent strains for their ability to produce pili and to adhere to
      epithelial cells in culture. The total cell lysate protein and outer-membrane
      protein (OMP) profiles were also compared. Both the parent strains and their
      plasmid-cured derivatives produced pili. Immunofluorescence assay results
      indicated that the plasmid-cured and parent strains adhered equally well to HEp-2
      and Intestine 407 cells; overall adherence was greater with intestinal cells than
      HEp-2 cells. SDS-PAGE of polypeptides synthesised in an E. coli system in vitro
      showed that plasmid DNA encodes c. 35 proteins. SDS-PAGE of OMP preparations
      demonstrated that the 60-MDa plasmid appears to be involved in the synthesis of a
      33-kDa OMP. Two strains cured of the 60-MDa plasmid, one that possessed no
      plasmids and one that still contained a 2.2-MDa plasmid, produced
      exopolysaccharide (EPS) when cultured on solid medium at 25 degrees C. Two other 
      strains, which were cured of the 60-MDa plasmid but contained a 4.5-MDa plasmid, 
      did not produce visible amounts of EPS. Gas chromatography analysis showed that
      the EPS consisted of fucose, glucose and galactose in an approximate molar ratio 
      of 2.0:0.9:1.1 and also had 7% of a uronic acid sugar as part of its structure.

TI  - Fate of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 in apple cider with and
      without preservatives.
PG  - 2526-30
AB  - A strain of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli serotype O157:H7 isolated from a
      patient in an apple cider-related outbreak was used to study the fate of E. coli 
      O157:H7 in six different lots of unpasteurized apple cider. In addition, the
      efficacy of two preservatives, 0.1% sodium benzoate and 0.1% potassium sorbate,
      used separately and in combination was evaluated for antimicrobial effects on the
      bacterium. Studies were done at 8 or 25 degrees C with ciders having pH values of
      3.6 to 4.0. The results revealed that E. coli O157:H7 populations increased
      slightly (ca. 1 log10 CFU/ml) and then remained stable for approximately 12 days 
      in lots inoculated with an initial population of 10(5) E. coli O157:H7 organisms 
      per ml and held at 8 degrees C. The bacterium survived from 10 to 31 days or 2 to
      3 days at 8 or 25 degrees C, respectively, depending on the lot. Potassium
      sorbate had minimal effect on E. coli O157:H7 populations, with survivors
      detected for 15 to 20 days or 1 to 3 days at 8 or 25 degrees C, respectively. In 
      contrast, survivors in cider containing sodium benzoate were detected for only 2 
      to 10 days or less than 1 to 2 days at 8 or 25 degrees C, respectively. The
      highest rates of inactivation occurred in the presence of a combination of 0.1%
      sodium benzoate and 0.1% potassium sorbate. The use of 0.1% sodium benzoate, an
      approved preservative used by some cider processors, will substantially increase 
      the safety of apple cider in terms of E. coli O157:H7, in addition to suppressing
      the growth of yeasts and molds.

PG  - 2364-8
AB  - A study was undertaken to determine the fate of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in
      ground, roasted beef as influenced by the combined effects of pH, acidulants,
      temperature, and time. There was essentially no change in the viable population
      of E. coli O157:H7 when beef salads (pH 5.40 to 6.07) containing up to 40%
      mayonnaise were incubated at 5 degrees C for up to 72 h. At 21 and 30 degrees C, 
      significant (P < or = 0.05) increases in populations of the organism occurred in 
      salads containing 16 to 32% mayonnaise (pH 5.94 to 5.55) between 10 and 24 h of
      incubation. Death was more rapid as the pH of acidified beef slurries incubated
      at 5 degrees C was decreased from 5.98 to 4.70. E. coli O157:H7 grew in control
      slurries (pH 5.98) and in slurries containing citric and lactic acids (pHs 5.00
      and 5.40) incubated at 21 degrees C for 24 h; decreases occurred in slurries
      acidified to pHs 4.70, 5.00, and 5.40 with acetic acid or pH 4.70 with citric or 
      lactic acid. At 30 degrees C, populations decreased in slurries acidified to pHs 
      4.70 and 5.00 with acetic acid. Citric and lactic acids failed to prevent
      significant increases in populations in slurries at pH 4.70 to 5.40 between 10
      and 24 h of incubation. The order of effectiveness of acidulants in inhibiting
      growth was acetic acid > lactic acid > or = citric acid. The same order was
      observed for inactivation of E. coli O157:H7 in acidified (pH 5.00) beef slurry
      heated at 54 degrees C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Rectal mucosal major basic protein in infants with dietary protein-induced
      colitis.
PG  - 66-9
AB  - Dietary protein-induced colitis is a frequent cause of rectal bleeding in
      infants. The exact pathogenic mechanism is unknown but the disorder has been
      thought to be due to an allergic response. Rectal mucosal edema and eosinophilia 
      are typically found but there are no specific markers currently available.
      Because eosinophil degranulation, as evidenced by the release of major basic
      protein, has been implicated in hypersensitivity disorders, we aimed to assess
      major basic protein deposition as a marker of dietary protein-induced colitis
      occurring in young infants. Suction rectal biopsies from five infants aged 1 to 7
      months with findings consistent with dietary protein-induced colitis were
      compared histologically with five age matched controls who underwent rectal
      biopsies to rule out Hirschsprung's disease. An established indirect
      immunofluorescent staining method was used to identify tissue major basic
      protein. Comparable rectal deposition of major basic protein was found for the
      controls and colitic patients. Mucosal eosinophilia but not mast cell content was
      more prominent in the colitic patients (P < .05) than in the controls. Some of
      the colitic infants had elevated serum IgE levels (1 of 5), positive RAST for
      milk (2 of 5), and peripheral blood eosinophilia (1 of 5). Our findings do not
      support the concept that dietary protein-induced colitis of infancy is due solely
      to an immediate hypersensitivity response. The results also indicate that major
      basic protein is probably not a marker or likely primary mediator of this
      disorder.

PG  - 496-501
AB  - In a group of 24 patients with ulcerative colitis and in 15 persons in the
      control group allergological studies were carried out which included history
      taking, cutaneous tests, assessment of total concentration and presence of
      specific IgE in the serum, and selected immune response indices (Ig levels,
      immune complex concentration and numbers of T- and B-cells). In our studies it
      was found that in two-thirds of patients with ulcerative colitis clinical
      reactions after meal occurred, in 54% atopy coexisted, and immunological
      abnormalities occurred more frequently than in the control group. Our studies
      proved that the role of various reactions to consumed meal, including early
      allergic reactions, cannot be rejected with full certainty. A number of indirect 
      evidence that type I allergy according to Gell and Coombs, and immunological
      abnormalities participated in the pathological mechanism of that disease was also
      found.

TI  - [Clostridium difficile in early childhood ulcerative pancolitis].
PG  - 474-7
AB  - Ulcerative colitis is a rare disease in young infants. Less than one per cent of 
      cases occur during the first two years of life. We describe a male child who
      developed frequent bloody diarrhea at the age of 20 months. More common causes
      like infections or gastrointestinal food allergy were excluded. Endoscopy and
      histopathological evaluations revealed ulcerative colitis of the entire colon.
      Treatment with sulfasalazine and prednisone resulted in a clinical remission
      after seven weeks. The follow-up of 15 months was complicated by Rotavirus
      infection. Two relapses were caused by Clostridium difficile infections. The
      latter were successfully treated with oral vancomycine, but in the last relapse
      an increased dosage of prednisone was required, too. In relapses of inflammatory 
      bowel disease gastrointestinal infections, especially caused by Clostridium
      difficile should be considered and treated adequately.

TI  - An outbreak of diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome from Escherichia coli
      O157:H7 in fresh-pressed apple cider.
PG  - 2217-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Escherichia coli O157:H7 causes hemorrhagic colitis and the hemolytic 
      uremic syndrome. In the fall of 1991, an outbreak of E coli O157:H7 infections in
      southeastern Massachusetts provided an opportunity to identify transmission by a 
      seemingly unlikely vehicle. DESIGN: Case-control study to determine the vehicle
      of infection. New England cider producers were surveyed to assess production
      practices and determined the survival time of E coli O157:H7 organisms in apple
      cider. RESULTS: Illness was significantly associated with drinking one brand of
      apple cider. Thirteen (72%) of 18 patients but only 16 (33%) of 49 controls
      reported drinking apple cider in the week before illness began (odds ratio [OR], 
      8.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8 to 39.7). Among those who drank cider, 12 
      (92%) of 13 patients compared with two (13%) of 16 controls drank cider from
      cider mill A (lower 95% CI, 2.9; P < .01). This mill pressed cider in a manner
      similar to that used by other small cider producers: apples were not washed,
      cider was not pasteurized, and no preservatives were added. In the laboratory, E 
      coli O157:H7 organisms survived for 20 days in unpreserved refrigerated apple
      cider. Addition of sodium benzoate 0.1% reduced survival to less than 7 days.
      CONCLUSIONS: Fresh-pressed, unpreserved apple cider can transmit E coli O157:H7
      organisms, which cause severe infections. Risk of transmission can be reduced by 
      washing and brushing apples before pressing, and preserving cider with sodium
      benzoate. Consumers can reduce their risk by only drinking cider made from apples
      that have been washed and brushed.

TI  - Red blood cell folate is associated with the development of dysplasia and cancer 
      in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 549-54
AB  - Patients with extensive ulcerative colitis have a high risk of developing colon
      cancer. The etiology of mucosal dysplasia, a premalignant lesion that is used as 
      a screening test in surveillance programs, is unknown. Previously, a case-control
      study [Lashner et al. (1989) Gastroenterology 97:255-259] suggested that folate
      supplementation was associated with a 62% reduction in the risk of developing
      dysplasia or cancer. The current case-control study was performed to obtain a
      better definition of this risk. All 67 patients with chronic ulcerative
      pancolitis having surveillance colonoscopy during a 1-year period were entered.
      There were 6 cases (4 with dysplasia and 2 with cancer) and 61 controls (no
      cancer or dysplasia). Red blood cell folate, reflecting intermediate-term stores,
      was a mean of 66.2 ng/ml lower in cases compared to controls. Serum folate,
      reflecting short-term stores, was not different between groups. Adjusting for
      confounding effects of age, sex, race, disease duration, and folate
      supplementation, the risk of dysplasia or cancer was significantly decreased by
      18% for each 10 ng/ml increase in red blood cell folate (odds ratio 0.82, 95%
      confidence interval 0.68-0.99). Vitamins A, D, and E and carotene were lower in
      cases than in controls, but no water-soluble vitamin other than red blood cell
      folate was associated with an increased cancer risk. Depressed red blood cell
      folate is associated with an increased risk of dysplasia and cancer in patients
      with ulcerative colitis and may be a risk factor for neoplastic transformation.

PG  - 533-8
AB  - The nucleophilic properties of human lactoferrin (Lf) were demonstrated by
      immunofluorescence microscopy using cryostat rat tissue sections, and the
      nuclear/perinuclear distribution of Lf in ethanol-fixed human neutrophils was
      visualized with rabbit anti-human Lf, producing a P-ANCA/GS-ANA staining pattern.
      Prevention of complement activation by Lf was confirmed in a haemolytic assay.
      Antibodies (IgG) against human Lf were studied by ELISA in sera from patients
      with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis,
      rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematous and primary Sjogren's syndrome.
      Anti-Lf antibodies were found in high frequency in ulcerative colitis and primary
      sclerosing cholangitis, but only occasionally in the other conditions.
