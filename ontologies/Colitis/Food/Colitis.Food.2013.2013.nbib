AB  - Multiple locus variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) analysis (MLVA) has become 
      a reliable tool, able to establish genetic relationships for epidemiological
      surveillance and molecular subtyping of pathogens such as verotoxigenic
      Escherichia coli (VTEC). This emerging pathogen whose primary reservoir is the
      cattle causes severe disease in humans, such as hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic
      uremic syndrome. With the aim of comparing a recently proposed MLVA assay with
      that used routinely in our laboratory, we analyzed a set of VTEC isolates (n =
      72) obtained from meat using both assays. All samples could be typed by the new
      MLVA assay, and an increase in the number of distinct profiles (31-43) was
      observed. However, intraserotype resolution was not significantly enhanced; thus,
      the incorporation of more VNTR loci is still needed to achieve a greater
      discrimination among non-O157:H7 serotypes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Food protein-induced enterocolitis (FPIES) is a rare non-IgE mediated
      disease. Most studies have been limited in nature, with the largest cohort being 
      66 patients. The most common foods that have been reported are milk and soy.
      OBJECTIVE: A retrospective chart review of patients seen in the Allergy Section
      at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia with International Classification of
      Diseases Ninth Revision code of 558.3 (Allergic Gastroenteritis and Colitis)
      between 2007 and 2012 was conducted to identify patients with suspected FPIES.
      Diagnosis of FPIES was confirmed based on meeting clinical criteria of delayed
      reaction with pronounced vomiting and/or diarrhea. Data regarding patient
      characteristics and features of their reactions were collected for analysis and
      comparison with existing studies. RESULTS: A total of 462 cases were identified
      in our chart review. Patients had a similar demographic profile to the normal
      allergy patients seen in our clinic. The most common foods identified were milk
      (67%), soy (41%), rice (19%), oat (16%), and egg (11%). Patients had onset of
      FPIES to milk and soy around 7 months of age compared with 12 months of age for
      solid foods. FPIES reactions were identified to meats, tree nuts, peanuts,
      fruits, and vegetables; 70% of the patients reacted to one or two foods. Skin
      prick testing and atopy patch testing were not helpful in identifying the foods. 
      CONCLUSION: FPIES reactions were seen more frequently than previously described. 
      However, the presentation and clinical features were similar to previous reports.
      Milk- and soy-triggered FPIES were common, and 43.5% of patients who had a milk
      trigger reacted to soy. There is no laboratory test to identify foods that cause 
      FPIES, and clinician-supervised oral food challenge is the only definitive test
      available.

AB  - Metronidazole and vancomycin remain the front-line therapies for most Clostridium
      difficile infections (CDI). However, recurrent CDI occurs in approximately 25% of
      patients, causing significant morbidity and mortality and healthcare costs. For
      this population, traditional antibiotic therapies fail and new treatment options 
      are greatly needed. The US Food and Drug Administration recently approved
      fidaxomicin for CDI treatment. This narrow-spectrum antibiotic preserves the
      normal gut microbiota and shows promise as a treatment for severe and recurrent
      CDI. Monoclonal antibodies and vaccines directed against toxin are currently in
      clinical trials and represent alternative, non-antibiotic therapies. Less
      traditional therapeutic interventions include bacteriotherapy with non-toxigenic 
      C. difficile and fecal transplant. This commentary will provide an overview of
      current and forthcoming CDI therapies.

      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 73-81
LID - 10.1016/j.redox.2013.12.012 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inorganic nitrate and nitrite have emerged as alternative substrates 
      for nitric oxide (NO) generation in the gastrointestinal tract, and have shown to
      be protective against drug-induced gastric injury. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the preventive and therapeutic effects of nitrate and nitrite in a
      model of experimental colitis. METHODS: Colitis was induced in mice by
      administrating dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) with concurrent administration of
      nitrite (1 mM) or nitrate (10 mM) in the drinking water for 7 days. A therapeutic
      approach was also investigated by initiating nitrite treatment 3 days after
      DSS-induced colitis. Clinical and inflammatory markers were assessed and the
      colonic mucus thickness was measured in vivo. The effect of nitrite on wound
      healing was evaluated using colon epithelial cells. RESULTS: Concurrent
      administration of DSS and nitrite (1 mM) alleviated inflammation as determined by
      reduced disease activity index score (DAI) and increased colon length, while
      nitrate (10 mM) only reduced the DAI-score. Nitrite also displayed therapeutic
      effects by ameliorating established colonic inflammation with reduced colonic
      expression of iNOS and improving histopathology. DSS-induced decrease in colonic 
      mucus thickness was completely prevented by nitrite administration. In addition, 
      goblet cell abundance was lower by DSS treatment, but was increased by addition
      of nitrite. Further studies using colon epithelial cells revealed an NO-dependent
      improvement in wound healing with nitrite administration. CONCLUSION: Nitrite
      exerts both preventive and therapeutic effects in colonic inflammation. The
      protective effects involve preservation of an intact adherent mucus layer and
      regulation of epithelial cell restitution.

PG  - 1-13
LID - 10.1007/s12328-013-0440-8 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics have been used for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).
      However, the effects of probiotics on the induction and maintenance of remission 
      in ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) still remain controversial.
      This systematic review verified the findings of high-quality randomized
      controlled trials (RCTs) which investigated the therapeutic effects of probiotics
      on IBD. After the quality assessment, 20 RCTs which investigated the effects of
      probiotics on the induction or maintenance of remission in IBD were identified.
      From the results of the validation of these RCTs, beneficial effects of probiotic
      treatments to improve the response rate and remission rate on the remission
      induction therapies [risk ratio (RR) 1.81; 95 % confidence interval (CI)
      1.40-2.35 and RR 1.56; 95 % CI 0.95-2.56, respectively] were verified.
      Furthermore, probiotic treatments exhibited effects equal to mesalazine on the
      maintenance of remission in UC (RR 1.00; 95 % CI 0.79-1.26). In contrast, no
      significant effect of probiotic treatments was shown in either the induction or
      maintenance of remission in CD. Because there were many variations in the
      conditions among these studies, a further analysis evaluating the effects of
      probiotic treatments in IBD is needed to clarify the optimal probiotics and
      treatment regimens for each condition or population in IBD patients.

AB  - Curcumin is a phytocompound found in the root of turmeric, a common herbal
      ingredient in many Asian cuisines. The compound contains anti-inflammatory
      activity, which is mediated through an up-regulation of adiponectin and reduction
      of leptin. Consumption of curcumin was shown to prevent some deteriorative
      conditions caused by inflammation, such as ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid
      arthritis and esophagitis, and so on. Inflammation-associated cardiovascular
      conditions such as atherosclerosis are common in diabetes patients. The
      anti-inflammation effect of curcumin might be beneficial to prevent such
      condition in these patients. We aim to evaluate an antiatherosclerosis effect of 
      curcumin in diabetes patients. Effects of curcumin on risk factors for
      atherosclerosis were investigated in a 6-month randomized, double-blinded and
      placebo-controlled clinical trial that included subjects diagnosed with type 2
      diabetes. An atherosclerosis parameter, the pulse wave velocity, and other
      metabolic parameters in patients treated with placebo and curcumin were compared.
      Our results showed that curcumin intervention significantly reduced pulse wave
      velocity, increased level of serum adiponectin and decreased level of leptin.
      These results are associated with reduced levels of homeostasis model
      assessment-insulin resistance, triglyceride, uric acid, visceral fat and total
      body fat. In summary, a 6-month curcumin intervention in type 2 diabetic
      population lowered the atherogenic risks. In addition, the extract helped to
      improve relevant metabolic profiles in this high-risk population.

AB  - Gut microbiota is more and more important since metagenomic research have brought
      new knowledge on this topic especially for human health. Firstly, gut microbiota 
      is a key element for our organism he lives in symbiosis with. Secondly, it
      interacts favorably with many physiological functions of our organism. Thirdly,
      at the opposite, it can be an active participant in intestinal pathologies linked
      to a dysbiosis mainly in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn disease
      or ulcerative colitis but also in obesity, metabolic syndrome, and more prudently
      in autism and behavioral disorders. In order to keep a good health, it is
      essential to protect our gut microbiota as soon as our young age and maintain it 
      healthy. Face to a more and more important number of publications for treating
      certain digestive diseases with fecal microbial transplantation, it needs to be
      very careful and recommend further studies in order to assess risks and define
      standardized protocols. Gut microbiota metabolic capacities towards xenobiotics
      need to be developed, and we must take an interest in the modifications they
      induce on medicinal molecules. On the other hand, it is essential to study the
      potent effects of pesticides and other pollutants on microbiota functions.

TI  - Probiotics, prebiotics and symbiotics in inflammatory bowel diseases:
      state-of-the-art and new insights.
PG  - 919-33
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consists of two distinct clinical forms,
      ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), with unknown aetiology, which
      nevertheless are considered to share almost identical pathophysiological
      backgrounds. Up to date, a full coherent mechanistic explanation for IBD is still
      lacking, but people start to realize that the pathogenesis of IBD involves four
      fundamental components: the environment, gut microbiota, the immune system and
      the genome. As a consequence, IBD development might be due to an altered immune
      response and a disrupted mechanism of host tolerance to the non-pathogenic
      resident microbiota, leading to an elevated inflammatory response. Considering
      the available data arising from the scientific literature, here reviewed, in CD, 
      a benefit of probiotics remains unproven; in UC, a benefit of probiotics remains 
      unproven, even if E. coli Nissle 1917 seems promising in maintaining remission
      and it could be considered an alternative in patients intolerant or resistant to 
      5-ASA preparations; in pouchitis, small controlled trials suggest a benefit from 
      VSL no. 3 in the primary and secondary prevention of pouchitis; in IBD-associated
      conditions, a benefit of probiotics remains unproven. However, well-designed
      randomized control clinical trials are necessary to understand the undoubted role
      of these agents in the management of gut physiology in health and disease.

TI  - Diarylacylhydrazones: Clostridium-selective antibacterials with activity against 
      stationary-phase cells.
PG  - 595-600
LID - 10.1016/j.bmcl.2013.12.015 [doi]
AB  - Current antibiotics for treating Clostridium difficile infections (CDI), that is,
      metronidazole, vancomycin and more recently fidaxomicin, are mostly effective but
      treatment failure and disease relapse remain as significant clinical problems.
      The shortcomings of these agents are attributed to their low selectivity for C.
      difficile over normal gut microflora and their ineffectiveness against C.
      difficile spores. This Letter reports that certain diarylacylhydrazones
      identified during a high-throughput screening/counter-screening campaign show
      selective activity against two Clostridium species (C. difficile and Clostridium 
      perfringens) over common gut commensals. Representative examples are shown to
      possess activity similar to vancomycin against clinical C. difficile strains and 
      to kill stationary-phase C. difficile cells, which are responsible for spore
      production. Structure-activity relationships with additional synthesised
      analogues suggested a protonophoric mechanism may play a role in the observed
      activity/selectivity and this was supported by the well-known protonophore
      carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) showing selective
      anti-Clostridium effects and activity similar to diarylacylhydrazones against
      stationary-phase C. difficile cells. Two diarylacylhydrazones were shown to be
      non-toxic towards human FaDu and Hep G2 cells indicating that further studies
      with the class are warranted towards new drugs for CDI.

TI  - Altered human gut dendritic cell properties in ulcerative colitis are reversed by
      Lactobacillus plantarum extracellular encrypted peptide STp.
PG  - 1132-43
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201300596 [doi]
AB  - SCOPE: The human/microbiota cross-talk is partially mediated by bacteria-derived 
      peptides like Serine-Threonine peptide (STp), which is resistant to gut
      proteolysis, is found in the human healthy colon and induces regulatory
      properties on gut dendritic cells (DCs); here we characterized human gut DC in
      ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and studied the effect of STp on their
      properties. METHODS AND RESULTS: Human colonic DC from healthy controls and UC
      patients were isolated, conditioned for 24 h +/- STp and characterized by flow
      cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy. Expression of immature 
      DC markers DC-SIGN and ILT3, and Toll-like receptors were increased on gut UC-DC.
      Langerin (involved in phagocytosis), lymph node homing marker CCR7, and
      activation markers CD40/CD80/CD86 were decreased in UC. Gut DC had restricted
      stimulatory capacity for T-cells in UC. Conditioning of DC with STp in vitro
      reduced Toll-like receptor expression, increased CD40 and CD80 expression, and
      restored their stimulatory capacity. CONCLUSION: Colonic DCs display an abnormal 
      immature phenotype in UC, which was partially restored following STp treatment.
      Bacteria-derived metabolites, like STp, seem to have a role in gut homeostasis
      that is missing in UC so they might lead a new era of probiotic products setting 
      the basis for nondrug dietary therapy in inflammatory bowel disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is
      increasing in Eastern Europe possibly due to changes in environmental factors
      towards a more "westernised" standard of living. The aim of this study was to
      investigate differences in exposure to environmental factors prior to diagnosis
      in Eastern and Western European IBD patients. METHODS: The EpiCom cohort is a
      population-based, prospective inception cohort of 1560 unselected IBD patients
      from 31 European countries covering a background population of 10.1 million. At
      the time of diagnosis patients were asked to complete an 87-item questionnaire
      concerning environmental factors. RESULTS: A total of 1182 patients (76%)
      answered the questionnaire, 444 (38%) had Crohn's disease (CD), 627 (53%)
      ulcerative colitis (UC), and 111 (9%) IBD unclassified. No geographic differences
      regarding smoking status, caffeine intake, use of oral contraceptives, or number 
      of first-degree relatives with IBD were found. Sugar intake was higher in CD and 
      UC patients from Eastern Europe than in Western Europe while fibre intake was
      lower (p<0.01). Daily consumption of fast food as well as appendectomy before the
      age of 20 was more frequent in Eastern European than in Western European UC
      patients (p<0.01). Eastern European CD and UC patients had received more
      vaccinations and experienced fewer childhood infections than Western European
      patients (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In this European population-based inception
      cohort of unselected IBD patients, Eastern and Western European patients differed
      in environmental factors prior to diagnosis. Eastern European patients exhibited 
      higher occurrences of suspected risk factors for IBD included in the Western
      lifestyle.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Fatigue, weakness and musculoskeletal manifestations are
      associated with IBD. An impaired nutritional status and a reduced physical
      activity can contribute to these clinical outcomes, impacting quality of life and
      increasing disability. This study aims to assess muscle strength and lower limb
      physical performance in female UC patients, taking into consideration disease
      activity, body composition and habitual physical activity. METHODS: A
      case-control study was performed including 23 UC female outpatients and 23 age-
      and BMI-matched healthy women as controls. Quadriceps strength (QS), handgrip
      strength (HGS), physical performance based measures (five repetitions sit-up test
      and 4meter gait speed test), body composition (bioelectrical impedance analysis, 
      anthropometry), and habitual physical activity (HPA) levels were assessed.
      RESULTS: UC group had decreased QS (-6%; P=0.012), slower sit-up test (-32%;
      P=0.000), slower gait speed (-17% P=0.002) and decreased HPA level (-30%,
      P=0.001) compared with controls. No difference in HGS was observed between
      groups. Logistic regression showed that UC was an independent factor for
      decreased QS and slower sit-up test, while HPA was a protective factor for
      impaired gait speed. Multivariate linear regression showed that BMI was
      independently associated with an improved QS and slower sit-up test in the UC
      group. CONCLUSION: Women with UC had decreased lower limb strength and mobility
      limitations, which were associated with BMI and the level of physical activity.
      Early evaluation of nutritional status and performance of the lower limbs could
      identify UC patients with pre-clinical disability who may benefit from earlier
      health lifestyle modifications.

AB  - The diverse and complex community of microorganisms that has co-evolved with the 
      human gut is vital to intestinal functioning, and disturbances in the microbiota 
      and its relationship with the host immune system have been linked to inflammatory
      bowel diseases, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. This has
      suggested several treatment options, including antibiotics, probiotics and faecal
      transplantation. The human microbiome project has been established to enable
      comprehensive characterisation of the human microbiota and in the coming years,
      knowledge in this area is expected to continue to expand.

TI  - Polymorphisms in the sodium-dependent ascorbate transporter gene SLC23A1 are
      associated with susceptibility to Crohn disease.
PG  - 378-83
LID - 10.3945/ajcn.113.068015 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are 2 common
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) associated with intestinal inflammation and
      tissue damage. Oxidative stress is suggested to play a major role in the
      initiation and progression of IBD. Vitamin C (ascorbate, ascorbic acid)
      supplementation has reduced oxidative stress in persons with IBD. The role of
      ascorbate transporters in IBD remains to be determined. SLC23A1 is a major
      ascorbate transporter in the intestinal tract, and some of its genetic variants
      have been associated with severely decreased ascorbate transport and lower
      systemic concentrations. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether common 
      genetic variants in the vitamin C transporter SLC23A1 are associated with the
      risk of IBD. DESIGN: Genomic DNA samples from patients with CD (n = 162) and UC
      (n = 149) from the Manitoba IBD Cohort Study and ethnically matched controls (n =
      142) were genotyped for 3 SLC23A1 polymorphisms (rs6596473, rs33972313, and
      rs10063949) by using TaqMan assays. RESULTS: Variation at rs10063949 (G allele
      for heterozygote and homozygote) was associated with increased susceptibility to 
      CD (OR: 2.54; 95% CI: 1.38, 4.66; OR: 4.72; 95% CI: 2.53, 8.81; P < 0.0001;
      respectively). A strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) was observed across the
      SLC23A1 region (variation rs6596473 with rs10063949) for CD and UC (D' = 0.94 and
      0.96, respectively). The risk alleles confirmed a haplotype (CGG) that is carried
      more in CD patients (65.3%, P < 0.0001) than in controls (43.5%). CONCLUSIONS: A 
      genetic variant (rs10063949-G) in the SLC23A1 ascorbate transporter locus was
      identified and is associated with an increased risk of CD in a white Canadian IBD
      cohort. The presented evidence that SLC23A1 variations can modulate the risk of
      CD has implications for understanding ascorbate transport in CD patients and
      provides a novel opportunity toward individualized nutritional therapy for
      patients carrying the disease-associated genotype.

LID - 10.1186/1475-2891-12-152 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In animal models, excess luminal iron exacerbates colonic
      inflammation and cancer development. Moreover, in inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) patients with mild to moderate disease activity dietary fortificant iron
      intake is inversely related to quality of life. Here we sought to determine
      whether dietary iron intakes were also related to quality of life in IBD patients
      in remission. METHODS: Forty eight patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), 42 of
      which had quiescent disease during this observational study, and 53 healthy
      control subjects completed quality of life questionnaires and 7-day food diaries.
      For comparative analysis, 34/group were matched and the linear relationship
      between dietary iron intakes (total, haem, non-haem or fortificant) and EuroQol
      quality of life measures was investigated. For UC patients the linear
      relationship between dietary iron intakes and the scores from the disease
      specific inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ) was also considered.
      RESULTS: The intake of dietary iron, and its various sub-fractions, were not
      associated with quality of life (EuroQol) in patients with quiescent disease or
      in healthy control subjects. The picture was similar for the 42 quiescent UC
      patients when disease-specific IBDQ was used. However, the 6 patients who
      relapsed during the study again showed an inverse association between IBDQ and
      dietary iron intake (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that dietary iron
      does not impact on quality of life in quiescent UC patients but support that,
      once the disease is triggered, luminal iron may be a permissive factor for
      exacerbation of disease activity resulting in lower quality of life.

AB  - The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is rapidly increasing in developing
      countries, especially among populations that are adopting Western-style diets.
      Several, but not all, epidemiological and experimental studies suggest that a
      high intake of meat, especially red and processed meat, is associated with
      increased CRC risk. Potential reasons for the association between high red and
      processed meat intake and CRC risk include the content of the meat (e.g. protein,
      heme) and compounds generated by the cooking process (e.g. N-nitroso compounds,
      heterocyclic amines). These factors can affect the large intestine mucosa with
      genotoxicity and metabolic disturbances. Increased bacterial fermentation
      (putrefaction) of undigested protein and production of bacterial metabolites
      derived from amino acids may affect colon epithelial homeostasis and renewal.
      This correlates with the fact that most colonic cancers are detected in the
      distal colon and rectum where protein fermentation actively occurs. However,
      there are still large controversies on the relationship between red meat
      consumption and CRC risk. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to enhance the
      current understanding on the association between high red and processed meat
      intakes with CRC risk. A principal focus of this review will be to discuss the
      meat-related components, such as proteins in the meat, heme, N-nitroso compounds,
      and heterocyclic amines, and the effects they have upon the large intestine
      mucosa and the intestinal gut microbiota.

AB  - Ample research has described multiple biological activities of probiotics in
      animals and in humans. Probiotics interfere with local and systemic immune
      reactions and thus exert an influence on the barrier function of the intestinal
      mucosa. Therefore, attempting inflammatory bowel disease treatment with
      probiotics seems reasonable. In fact, a growing number of trials have studied the
      therapeutic effects in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Promising results 
      have been found and in some, indications such as maintenance of remission of
      ulcerative colitis and pouchitis guidelines recommend therapy with probiotics
      already today. However, many open questions still remain and the urgent need for 
      high-quality trials requires much more research in the future.

TI  - The crystal structure of shiga toxin type 2 with bound disaccharide guides the
      design of a heterobifunctional toxin inhibitor.
PG  - 885-94
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M113.518886 [doi]
AB  - Shiga toxin type 2 (Stx2a) is clinically most closely associated with
      enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7-mediated hemorrhagic colitis that sometimes
      progresses to hemolytic-uremic syndrome. The ability to express the toxin has
      been acquired by other Escherichia coli strains, and outbreaks of food poisoning 
      have caused significant mortality rates as, for example, in the 2011 outbreak in 
      northern Germany. Stx2a, an AB5 toxin, gains entry into human cells via the
      glycosphingolipid receptor Gb3. We have determined the first crystal structure of
      a disaccharide analog of Gb3 bound to the B5 pentamer of Stx2a holotoxin. In this
      Gb3 analog,-GalNAc replaces the terminal-Gal residue. This co-crystal structure
      confirms previous inferences that two of the primary binding sites identified in 
      theB5 pentamer of Stx1 are also functional in Stx2a. This knowledge provides a
      rationale for the synthesis and evaluation of heterobifunctional antagonists for 
      E. coli toxins that target Stx2a. Incorporation of GalNAc Gb3 trisaccharide in a 
      heterobifunctional ligand with an attached pyruvate acetal, a ligand for human
      amyloid P component, and conjugation to
      poly[acrylamide-co-(3-azidopropylmethacrylamide)] produced a polymer that
      neutralized Stx2a in a mouse model of Shigatoxemia.

TI  - The human microbiome and probiotics: implications for pediatrics.
PG  - 42-52
LID - 10.1159/000354899 [doi]
AB  - Steady advances in our knowledge of the composition and function of the human
      microbiome at multiple body sites including the gut, skin and airways will likely
      contribute to our understanding of mechanisms of probiotic action by beneficial
      microbes. Microbe:microbe and microbe:human interactions are important
      considerations as we select probiotics for pediatric patients in the future.
      Although our knowledge about the composition of the microbiome is progressing
      rapidly, many gaps exist about the functional capacity and metabolic machinery of
      the human microbiome. Based on a limited amount of data, probiotics appear
      capable of altering the composition and function of the microbiome. Probiotics
      may be part of dietary strategies that combine ways to enhance microbiome
      function with nutrients that may be converted to active compounds promoting human
      health. Probiotics have yielded beneficial effects in numerous studies in the
      context of different diseases in pediatric gastroenterology. These disease states
      include necrotizing enterocolitis, antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis,
      acute gastroenteritis and irritable bowel syndrome. In the skin and airways, it
      is unclear if probiotics can affect the function of the microbiome to reduce the 
      impact of diseases such as asthma and atopic dermatitis. An enhanced
      understanding of the effects of probiotics on the microbiome should facilitate
      selection of optimal probiotic strains for specific diseases in the future.

LID - 10.1007/s00005-013-0261-y [doi]
AB  - Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS; recurrent aphthous ulcers; canker sores)
      belongs to the group of chronic, inflammatory, ulcerative diseases of the oral
      mucosa. Up to now, the etiopathogenesis of this condition remains unclear; it is,
      however, considered to be multifactorial. The results of currently performed
      studies indicate that genetically mediated disturbances of the innate and
      acquired immunity play an important role in the disease development. Factors that
      modify the immunologic response in RAS include: food allergies, vitamin and
      microelement deficiencies, hormonal and gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., celiac 
      disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis), some viral and bacterial
      infections, mechanical injuries and stress. In this paper, we presented the main 
      etiopathogenetic factors of RAS with a special emphasis on the mechanisms of the 
      immune response modification. Moreover, we discussed the crucial clinical
      symptoms and types of RAS together with epidemiologic data based on the current
      medical literature reports and our own observations.

PG  - 1821-8
LID - 10.1556/OH.2013.29750 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vitamin D has an important role in the immune regulation. Vitamin D
      is essential for innate and adaptive immune systems and it plays a significant
      role in the formation of immune tolerance, as well. AIM: Vitamin D deficiency has
      been observed in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases in Western Europe, but
      there is no data available from Eastern Europe. METHOD: The study included 169
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease. RESULTS: The median vitamin D level was
      22.7+/-10.6 ng/ml. Only 20% of the patients had adequate vitamin D level (>30
      ng/ml), 52% had vitamin D insufficiency (15-30 ng/ml), and 28% of them had severe
      vitamin D deficiency (<15 ng/ml). Vitamin D concentration failed to correlate
      with clinical activity indexes (partial Mayo score: r = -0.143; Crohn's disease
      activity index: r = -0.253) and with inflammatory parameters (C-reactive protein:
      r = 0.008; erythrocyte sedimentation rate: r = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: Since vitamin
      D deficiency can be frequently observed in Hungarian patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease, its level should be tested in these patients.

TI  - Dynamics of vitamin D in patients with mild or inactive inflammatory bowel
      disease and their families.

AB  - BACKGROUND: 25(OH) vitamin D levels may be low in patients with moderately or
      severely active inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD: Crohn's disease and Idiopathic 
      Ulcerative Colitis) but this is less clear in patients with mild or inactive IBD.
      Furthermore there is limited information of any family influence on 25(OH)
      vitamin D levels in IBD. As a possible risk factor we hypothesize that vitamin D 
      levels may also be low in families of IBD patients. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate
      25[OH] vitamin D levels in patients with IBD in remission or with mild activity. 
      A second objective is to evaluate whether there are relationships within IBD
      family units of 25[OH] vitamin D and what are the influences associated with
      these levels. METHODS: Participants underwent medical history, physical
      examination and a 114 item diet questionnaire. Serum 25[OH] vitamin D was
      measured, using a radioimmunoassay kit, (replete >/= 75, insufficient 50-74,
      deficient < 25-50, or severely deficient < 25 nmol/L). Associations between
      25[OH] vitamin D and twenty variables were evaluated using univariate regression.
      Multivariable analysis was also applied and intrafamilial dynamics were assessed.
      RESULTS: 55 patients and 48 controls with their respective families participated 
      (N206). 25[OH] vitamin D levels between patients and controls were similar (71.2 
      +/- 32.8 vs. 68.3 +/-26.2 nmol/L). Vitamin D supplements significantly increased 
      intake but correlation with serum 25[OH] vitamin D was significant only during
      non sunny months among patients. Within family units, patients' families had mean
      replete levels (82.3 +/- 34.2 nmol/L) and a modest correlation emerged during
      sunny months between patients and family (r2 =0.209 p = 0.032). These
      relationships were less robust and non significant in controls and their
      families. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with mild or inactive IBD 25[OH] vitamin D
      levels are less than ideal but are similar to controls. Taken together
      collectively, the results of this study suggest that patient family dynamics may 
      be different in IBD units from that in control family units. However contrary to 
      the hypothesis, intra familial vitamin D dynamics do not pose additional risks
      for development of IBD.

AB  - Omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) have well documented
      anti-inflammatory properties, and consequently therapeutic potential in chronic
      inflammatory diseases. Here we discuss the effects of n-3 PUFAs on various
      inflammatory pathways and how this leads to alterations in the function of
      inflammatory cells, most importantly endothelial cells and leukocytes. Strong
      evidence indicates n-3 PUFAs are beneficial as a dietary supplement in certain
      diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis; however for other conditions such as
      asthma, the data are less robust. A clearer understanding of the pharmacology of 
      n-3 PUFAs will help to establish targets to modulate chronic inflammatory
      diseases.

AB  - We report the case of a 69-year-old man who presented with acute kidney injury in
      the setting of community-acquired Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea and
      biopsy-proven acute oxalate nephropathy. We discuss potential mechanisms,
      including increased colonic permeability to oxalate. We conclude that C
      difficile-associated diarrhea is a potential cause of acute oxalate nephropathy.

AB  - Recommendations to consume fish for prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD),
      along with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved generally recognized as
      safe (GRAS) status for long chain omega-3 fatty acids, may have had the
      unanticipated consequence of encouraging long-chain omega-3 (omega-3) fatty acid 
      [(eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)] supplementation and
      fortification practices. While there is evidence supporting a protective role for
      EPA/DHA supplementation in reducing sudden cardiac events, the safety and
      efficacy of supplementation with LComega-3PUFA in the context of other disease
      outcomes is unclear. Recent studies of bacterial, viral, and fungal infections in
      animal models of infectious disease demonstrate that LComega-3PUFA intake dampens
      immunity and alters pathogen clearance and can result in reduced survival. The
      same physiological properties of EPA/DHA that are responsible for the
      amelioration of inflammation associated with chronic cardiovascular pathology or 
      autoimmune states, may impair pathogen clearance during acute infections by
      decreasing host resistance or interfere with tumor surveillance resulting in
      adverse health outcomes. Recent observations that high serum LComega-3PUFA levels
      are associated with higher risk of prostate cancer and atrial fibrillation raise 
      concern for adverse outcomes. Given the widespread use of supplements and
      fortification of common food items with LComega-3PUFA, this review focuses on the
      immunomodulatory effects of the dietary LComega-3PUFAs, EPA and DHA, the
      mechanistic basis for potential negative health outcomes, and calls for biomarker
      development and validation as rational first steps towards setting recommended
      dietary intake levels.

TI  - Ipilimumab immune-related adverse reactions: a case report.
PG  - 315-7
AB  - Ipilimumab is an immunomodulating agent approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) as of March 2011 for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.
      The medication works by inhibiting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4, which
      typically works to down-regulate the T-cell response and protects self-antigens
      from recognition by the immune system. Since the T-cells are no longer
      down-regulated by this antigen, they are allowed to proliferate, thereby helping 
      to prevent melanoma tumor evasion. As a result of the up-regulation of the immune
      system, numerous immune-mediated adverse effects have been reported including
      colitis, dermatitis, hepatitis and rarely hypophysitis. Typically, these effects 
      are treated with high-dose steroids and most eventually resolve. We present a
      case of autoimmune (lymphocytic) hypophysitis following treatment with four doses
      of ipilimumab 3mg/kg and discuss the work-up, treatment and prognosis of the
      event.

TI  - The Th17 cell population and the immune homeostasis of the gastrointestinal
      tract.
PG  - 471-4
LID - 10.3109/08830185.2013.843983 [doi]
AB  - Th17 cells are a recently discovered subset of CD4(+) T lymphocytes filling a
      hole in the repertoire of effector T cells. Th17 cells produce multiple
      cytokines, with pivotal impact on immune homeostasis, inflammation, and
      influencing a wide range of intestinal cell targets. The current issue of the
      International Reviews of Immunology is entirely dedicated to the various roles of
      Th17 T cells in the immune homeostasis and inflammation occurring in the gut. In 
      addition to describing diverse Th17-mediated molecular pathways, a specific focus
      is being given to Th17 cell plasticity. This enables the Th17 cells to shift
      towards a Th1 profile, or to express IL-22, a protective cytokine in experimental
      colitis. Participation of microbiota-specific Th17 cells to normal immune
      homeostasis, and their role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD), or of gluten specific-Th17 cells in celiac disease, are also being
      discussed. Neutralizing antibodies against IL-17A and IL-17F have commenced
      clinical testing in IBD. In conclusion, Th17 cells emerge as a key immune cell
      population and further elucidation of their roles and functional plasticity are
      warranted to support the discovery of novel therapies against IBD and other
      intestinal disorders.

TI  - Vitamin D and Crohn's disease in the adult patient: a review.
PG  - 438-58
LID - 10.1177/0148607113506013 [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) is characterized as a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory
      disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. Current consensus surrounding the cause
      of the disease suggests a complex interplay between genetic susceptibility, the
      intestinal microbiome and environmental factors, leading to the aberrant Th1 and 
      Th17 immune cell mediated response. Vitamin D deficiency is common in CD
      patients, and long-standing deficiency has been associated with reduced bone
      mineral density (BMD). Accumulating evidence now suggests that in addition to
      maintaining skeletal integrity, vitamin D also plays an integral role in
      regulating the general immune response, a function employed via its genomic
      actions on the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The VDR is expressed in all immune cells
      and both directly and indirectly targeted by the bioactive form of vitamin D,
      1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]2D). Impaired regulation or deficiency of the
      vitamin has been linked to the promotion of self-reactive T cell development,
      loss of immune tolerance to self-structures, and experimental colitis in animal
      models, whereas the subsequent administration of the vitamin in these models
      resulted in the improvement of immune-mediated symptoms. In addition, low vitamin
      D has been associated with disease activity in CD patients, and supplementation
      appears to be beneficial in improving clinical scores and reducing inflammation. 
      Therefore, the primary aims of this article were to review the molecular evidence
      supporting the immunoregulatory roles of vitamin D and its supplementation in the
      CD patient, based on existing literature. The physiological processes, accepted
      serum concentration values, and its well-recognized role in bone health were also
      summarized.

TI  - Diet of patients after pouch surgery may affect pouch inflammation.
PG  - 6458-64
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v19.i38.6458 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To investigate the diet of pouch patients compared to healthy controls, and 
      to correlate pouch patients' diet with disease behavior. METHODS: Pouch patients 
      were recruited and prospectively followed-up at the Comprehensive Pouch Clinic at
      the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center. Pouch behavior was determined based on
      clinical, endoscopic and histological criteria. Healthy age- and sex-matched
      volunteers were selected from the "MABAT" Israeli Nutrition and Public Health
      Governmental Study and served as the control group. All the participants
      completed a 106-item food frequency questionnaire categorized into food groups
      and nutritional values based on those used in the United States Department of
      Agriculture food pyramid and the Israeli food pyramid. Data on Dietary behavior, 
      food avoidance, the use of nutritional supplements, physical activity, smoking
      habits, and body-mass index (BMI) were also obtained. Pouch patients who had
      familial adenomatous polyposis (n = 3), irritable pouch syndrome (n = 4), or
      patients whose pouch surgery took place less than one year previously (n = 5)
      were excluded from analysis. RESULTS: The pouch patients (n = 80) consumed
      significantly more from the bakery products food group (1.2 +/- 1.4 servings/d vs
      0.6 +/- 1.1 servings/d, P < 0.05) and as twice as many servings from the oils and
      fats (4.8 +/- 3.4 servings/d vs 2.4 +/- 2 servings/d, P < 0.05), and the nuts and
      seeds food group (0.3 +/- 0.6 servings/d vs 0.1 +/- 0.4 servings/d, P < 0.05)
      compared to the controls (n = 80). The pouch patients consumed significantly more
      total fat (97.6 +/- 40.5 g/d vs 84.4 +/- 39 g/d, P < 0.05) and fat components
      [monounsaturated fatty acids (38.4 +/- 16.4 g/d vs 30 +/- 14 g/d, P < 0.001), and
      saturated fatty acids (30 +/- 15.5 g/d vs 28 +/- 14.1 g/d, P < 0.00)] than the
      controls. In contrast, the pouch patients consumed significantly fewer
      carbohydrates (305.5 +/- 141.4 g/d vs 369 +/- 215.2 g/d, P = 0.03), sugars (124
      +/- 76.2 g/d vs 157.5 +/- 90.4 g/d, P = 0.01), theobromine (77.8 +/- 100 mg/d vs 
      236.6 +/- 244.5 mg/d, P < 0.00), retinol (474.4 +/- 337.1 mug/d vs 832.4 +/-
      609.6 mug/d, P < 0.001) and dietary fibers (26.2 +/- 15.4 g/d vs 30.7 +/- 14 g/d,
      P = 0.05) than the controls. Comparisons of the food consumption of the patients 
      without (n = 23) and with pouchitis (n = 45) showed that the former consumed
      twice as many fruit servings as the latter (3.6 +/- 4.1 servings/d vs 1.8 +/- 1.7
      servings/d, respectively, P < 0.05). In addition, the pouchitis patients consumed
      significantly fewer liposoluble antioxidants, such as cryptoxanthin (399 +/- 485 
      mug/d vs 890.1 +/- 1296.8 mug/d, P < 0.05) and lycopene (6533.1 +/- 6065.7 mug/d 
      vs 10725.7 +/- 10065.9 mug/d, P < 0.05), and less vitamin A (893.3 +/- 516 mug/d 
      vs 1237.5 +/- 728 mug/d, P < 0.05) and vitamin C (153.3 +/- 130 mg/d vs 285.3 +/-
      326.3 mg/d, P < 0.05) than the patients without pouchitis. The mean BMI of the
      pouchitis patients was significantly lower than the BMI of the patients with a
      normal pouch: 22.6 +/- 3.2 vs 27 +/- 4.9 (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Decreased
      consumption of antioxidants by patients with pouchitis may expose them to the
      effects of inflammatory and oxidative stress and contribute to the development of
      pouchitis.

TI  - Treatment of bone loss in osteopenic patients with Crohn's disease: a
      double-blind, randomised trial of oral risedronate 35 mg once weekly or placebo, 
      concomitant with calcium and vitamin D supplementation.
PG  - 1424-30
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2013-305523 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Osteoporosis and fractures are frequently encountered in patients with
      Crohn's disease. In order to prevent fractures, treatment with bone protecting
      drugs appears warranted early in the course of bone disease when bone loss is not
      yet prominent. We therefore aimed to demonstrate a beneficial effect on bone
      density of the bisphosphonate risedronate in osteopenic Crohn's disease patients.
      METHODS: This double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial of risedronate
      with calcium and vitamin D supplementation was performed in osteopenic Crohn's
      disease patients. Patients were treated for 2 years with follow-up after 3 and
      after every 6 months. Disease characteristics and activity and bone turnover
      markers were assessed at all visits; dual x-ray absorptiometry was performed at
      baseline, 12 and 24 months; radiographs of the spine at baseline and 24 months.
      RESULTS: Of 132 consenting patients, 131 were randomised (67 placebo and 64
      risedronate). Patient characteristics were similar in both groups, although the
      risedronate group was slightly heavier (body mass index 24.3 vs 23.0 kg/m(2)).
      Bone mineral density at lumbar spine increased 0.04 g/cm(2) on average in the
      risedronate group versus 0.01 g/cm(2) in the placebo group (p=0.007). The mean
      increase in total hip bone mineral density was 0.03 versus 0.01 g/cm(2),
      respectively (p=0.071). Fracture prevalence and incidence were similar. Change of
      T-scores and concentrations of bone turnover markers were consistent with a
      beneficial effect of risedronate when compared with placebo. The effect of
      risedronate was primarily demonstrated in the first 12 months of treatment. No
      serious unexpected suspected adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: A
      24-month treatment course with risedronate 35 mg once weekly, concomitant with
      calcium and vitamin D supplementation, in osteopenic Crohn's disease patients
      improved bone density at lumbar spine. NTR 163 Dutch Trial Register.

TI  - Sphingomyelin and phosphatidylcholine contrarily affect the induction of
      apoptosis in intestinal epithelial cells.
PG  - 782-98
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201300369 [doi]
AB  - SCOPE: The major alimentary sources for the plasma membrane lipid sphingomyelin
      (SM) are dairy products, eggs, and meat. We recently reported that the SM
      metabolite ceramide induces cathepsin D mediated apoptosis in murine intestinal
      epithelial cells (IECs) and increases inflammation in acute colitis. We
      investigated the impact of SM and phosphatidylcholine on apoptosis in human IECs 
      and point out BH3-interacting death agonist (BID) as link between cathepsin D and
      apoptosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: HT-29 and isolated human IECs were stimulated
      with SM or phosphatidylcholine. SM treatment resulted in increased apoptosis.
      Phosphatidylcholine showed contrary effects. Western revealed higher amounts of
      cathepsin D and BID activation upon lipid stimulation. Western blotting revealed 
      BID activation through SM in both an induced and a spontaneous mouse model of
      colitis. CONCLUSION: Dietary phospholipids may induce or abolish apoptosis in
      IECs and seem to play a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases. 
      This nutritional factor might be considered when evaluating the pathogenesis of
      inflammatory bowel diseases. Effects of SMase- and SM treatment on inflammation
      in dextran sulfate sodium induced animal models of colitis and in vitro
      experiments are discussed as controversial. Variable sources of SM, feeding
      techniques, and mouse strains might play a role.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the literature for clinical data on infants with allergic or
      eosinophilic colitis. DATA SOURCE: MEDLINE search of all indexes was performed
      using the words "colitis or proctocolitis and eosinophilic" or "colitis or
      proctocolitis and allergic" between 1966 and February of 2013. All articles that 
      described patients' characteristics were selected. DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 770
      articles were identified, of which 32 met the inclusion criteria. The 32 articles
      included a total of 314 infants. According to the available information, 61.6% of
      infants were male and 78.6% were younger than 6 months. Of the 314 patients,
      49.0% were fed exclusively breast milk, 44.2% received cow's milk protein, and
      6.8% received soy protein. Diarrheal stools were described in 28.3% of patients. 
      Eosinophilia was found in 43.8% (115/263) of infants. Colonic or rectal biopsy
      showed infiltration by eosinophils (between 5 and 25 per high-power field) in
      89.3% (236/264) of patients. Most patients showed improvement with the removal of
      the protein in cow's milk from their diet or the mother's diet. Allergy challenge
      tests with cow's milk protein were cited by 12 of the 32 articles (66 patients). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Eosinophilic colitis occurs predominantly in the first six months of
      life and in males. Allergy to cow's milk was considered the main cause of
      eosinophilic colitis. Exclusion of cow's milk from the diet of the lactating
      mother or from the infant's diet is generally an effective therapeutic measure.

TI  - Black raspberries protectively regulate methylation of Wnt pathway genes in
      precancerous colon tissue.
PG  - 1317-27
LID - 10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-13-0077 [doi]
AB  - Ulcerative colitis is frequently an intermediate step to colon cancer. The
      interleukin-10 knockout mouse is a genetic model of this progression. We report
      that knockout mice fed 5% black raspberries (BRB) had significantly less colonic 
      ulceration as compared with knockout mice that consumed the control diet.
      Dysfunction of the Wnt signaling pathway is a key event in ulcerative
      colitis-associated colon carcinogenesis. Therefore, we investigated the effects
      of BRBs on the Wnt pathway and found that the BRB-fed knockout mice exhibited a
      significantly lower level of beta-catenin nuclear translocation. We followed-up
      this observation by evaluating the effect of BRBs on selected Wnt pathway
      antagonists. The mRNA expression levels of wif1, sox17, and qki were diminished
      in the knockout mice, whereas they were expressed at normal levels in knockout
      mice that were fed BRBs. The lower mRNA expression of these genes in the colon
      from the knockout mice correlated with hypermethylation of their promoter
      regions; BRBs decreased their promoter methylation and increased mRNA expression 
      of these genes. This hypomethylation was associated with elevated protein
      expression of key proteins/enzymes that augment methylation, for example, dnmt3b,
      hdac1, hdac2, and mbd2 in the knockout mice; in addition, BRBs decreased the
      protein expression of these proteins/enzymes. The knockout mouse model
      recapitulates what occurs in human ulcerative colitis. Promoter methylation of
      CDH1 and SFRP1 was significantly higher in human ulcerative colitis tissues
      compared with their adjacent normal tissues. In conclusion, our results suggest
      that BRBs inhibit colonic ulceration and, ultimately, colon cancer partly through
      inhibiting aberrant epigenetic events that dysregulate Wnt signaling.

PG  - 1635-42
LID - 10.3892/mmr.2013.1726 [doi]
AB  - kappa-carrageenan (kappa-CGN) is an important food additive that has been
      demonstrated to induce colitis in animal models. In the present study, the
      effects of kappa-CGN were assessed using an in vitro co-culture system that
      contained intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells and activated macrophage-like THP-1 
      cells. The results demonstrated that in single cultures of Caco-2 and THP-1 cells
      treated with kappa-CGN, the cytotoxicity and the secretion levels of IL-1beta,
      IL-6 and TNF-alpha were low. In the co-culture system, however, kappa-CGN
      treatment resulted in apoptosis and reduced the transepithelial electrical
      resistance of the Caco-2 cell monolayers. The secretion levels of TNF-alpha,
      IL-1beta and IL-6 from the two cell types were increased significantly by
      kappa-CGN treatment. Furthermore, pretreatment of the co-culture system with
      anti-TNF receptor 1 antibody suppressed the kappa-CGN-induced apoptosis and
      attenuated the changes in the levels of IL-6 and IL-1beta in the Caco-2
      monolayers. This study indicated that kappa-CGN-induced TNF-alpha secretion is
      the main contributor to cellular damage in Caco-2 monolayers exposed to
      kappa-CGN.

TI  - Review article: the association of diet with onset and relapse in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1172-87
LID - 10.1111/apt.12501 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of diet in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is supported by 
      migration studies and increasing incidences in line with Westernisation. AIM: To 
      give a complete overview of studies associating habitual diet with the onset or
      relapses in ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: A
      structured search in Pubmed, the Cochrane Library and EMBASE was performed using 
      defined key words, including only full text papers in English language. RESULTS: 
      Forty-one studies were identified, investigating onset (n = 35), relapses (n = 5)
      or both (n = 1). Several studies reported high intake of sugar or
      sugar-containing foods (n = 7 UC, n = 12 CD), and low intake of fruits and/or
      vegetables (n = 5 UC, n = 10 CD) to be associated with an increased onset risk.
      However, these findings could not be confirmed by similar or higher numbers of
      other studies. A possible protective role was found for grain-derived products in
      CD onset, but results were inconsistent for dietary fibre in UC and CD and
      grain-derived products in UC. No definite conclusions could be drawn for
      unsaturated fatty acids (UFA), protein and energy intake due to limited and/or
      inconsistent results. Six studies reported on diet and relapse risk, of which
      only two (n = 1 UC, n = 1 CD) had a prospective follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The
      current evidence is not sufficient to draw firm conclusions on the role of
      specific food components or nutrients in the aetiology of IBD. Furthermore, large
      prospective studies into the role of habitual diet as a trigger of relapses are
      needed, to identify new therapeutic or preventive targets.

TI  - Profermin is efficacious in patients with active ulcerative colitis--a randomized
      controlled trial.
PG  - 2584-92

AB  - BACKGROUND: Profermin is developed for the dietary management of ulcerative
      colitis (UC). It consists of water, fermented oats, barley malt, lecithin, and
      Lactobacillus plantarum 299v. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical
      efficacy of Profermin. METHODS: Seventy-four patients with a mild-to-moderate
      flare-up of UC (defined as Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index [SCCAI] score
      >/=5 and </=11) were randomly assigned to Profermin (n = 32) or Fresubin (n =
      41). The primary endpoint was to assess whether addition of Profermin in UC could
      significantly reduce SCCAI in comparison with Fresubin. RESULTS: In the run-in
      period, the mean SCCAI was 7.2 +/- 1.50 in the Profermin group and 7.6 +/- 1.47
      in the Fresubin group (not significant). After 8 weeks of treatment, the mean
      reduction of SCCAI score was higher in the Profermin group (mean difference:
      -1.77 SCCAI, 95% confidence interval -2.97 to -0.55; P < 0.005), in
      intention-to-treat analyses. Remission defined as SCCAI </=2.5 was achieved in 10
      of 32 (31%) in the Profermin group and in 6 of 41 (15%) in the Fresubin group (P 
      = 0.048). The decrease in SCCAI scores of >/=50% was higher in the Profermin
      group 17 of 32 (53%) versus 11 of 41 (27%) (P = 0.04). The risk of dropping out
      due to treatment failure/lack of effect was higher in the Fresubin group (42%
      versus 13%, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation with Profermin is safe, well 
      tolerated, palatable, and able to reduce SCCAI scores at a statistically and
      clinically significant level in patients with mild-to-moderate UC with a
      flare-up.

AB  - Patients have strong beliefs about the role of diet in the cause of inflammatory 
      bowel disease (IBD) and in exacerbating or alleviating ongoing symptoms from IBD.
      The rapid increase in the incidence and prevalence of IBD in recent decades
      strongly suggests an environmental trigger for IBD, one of which may be dietary
      patterns. There are several pathways where diet may influence intestinal
      inflammation, such as direct dietary antigens, altering the gut microbiome, and
      affecting gastrointestinal permeability. However, data that altering diet can
      change the natural history of IBD are scarce, and evidence-based dietary
      guidelines for patients with IBD are lacking. Patients, therefore, seek
      nonmedical resources for dietary guidance, such as patient support groups and
      unverified sources on the Internet. The aim of this review is to identify
      patient-targeted dietary recommendations for IBD and to critically appraise the
      nutritional value of these recommendations. We review patient-targeted dietary
      information for IBD from structured Internet searches and popular defined diets. 
      Patient-targeted dietary recommendations focus on food restrictions and are
      highly conflicting. High-quality dietary intervention studies are needed to
      facilitate creation of evidence-based dietary guidelines for patients with IBD.

TI  - Review article: evidence-based dietary advice for patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease.
PG  - 1156-71
LID - 10.1111/apt.12500 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The therapeutic effect of enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease (CD)
      and the epidemiological associations between diet and inflammatory bowel disease 
      (IBD) implicate diet in IBD causation. There is little evidence, however, to
      support specific dietary changes and patients often receive contradictory advice.
      AIM: To review the literature on the impacts of diet on IBD causation and
      activity to produce guidance based on 'best available evidence'. METHOD: Review
      of Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases from 1975 to 2012 using MeSH headings
      'crohn's disease' 'ulcerative colitis' 'enteral' 'diet' 'nutrition' 'fatty acid' 
      and 'food additives'. RESULTS: Enteral nutrition with a formula-defined feed is
      effective treatment for CD, but approximately 50% of patients relapse within 6
      months of return to normal diet. There is no direct evidence of benefit from any 
      other specific dietary modification in CD, but indirect evidence supports
      recommendation of a low intake of animal fat, insoluble fibre and processed fatty
      foods containing emulsifiers. Foods tolerated in sustained remission may not be
      tolerated following relapse. Some evidence supports vitamin D supplementation. In
      ulcerative colitis (UC), evidence is weaker, but high intakes of meat and
      margarine correlate with increased UC incidence and high meat intake also
      correlates with increased likelihood of relapse. CONCLUSIONS: There is little
      evidence from interventional studies to support specific dietary recommendations.
      Nevertheless, people with IBD deserve advice based on 'best available evidence'
      rather than no advice at all, although dietary intake should not be
      inappropriately restrictive. Further interventional studies of dietary
      manipulation are urgently required.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Osteopenia and increased risk for fractures in IBD result from
      several factors. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the dietary intake of calcium
      in IBD patients. METHODS: A 22-item quantitative validated frequency food
      questionnaire was used for quantifying dietary calcium in relation to gender and 
      age, in 187 IBD patients, 420 normal- and 276 diseased controls. STATISTICAL
      ANALYSIS: Mann-Whitney, chi-square- and T-tests. RESULTS: The mean calcium intake
      was 991.0 +/- 536.0 (105.8% Recommended Daily Allowances) and 867.6 +/- 562.7 SD 
      mg/day (93.8% RDA) in healthy and diseased controls, and 837.8 +/- 482.0 SD
      mg/day (92.7% RDA) in IBD, P<0.001. Calcium intake was high in celiac disease
      (1165.7 +/- 798.8 SD mg/day, 120% RDA), and non-significantly lower in ulcerative
      colitis than in Crohn's disease (798.7 +/- 544.1 SD mg/day vs 881.9 +/- 433.0).
      CD and UC females, but not males, had a mean calcium intake well under RDA. In
      all study groups the intake was lower in patients believing that consumption of
      lactose-containing food induced symptoms, versus those who did not (105.8% vs
      114.3% RDA in normal controls; 100.4% vs 87.6% RDA in IBD). CONCLUSIONS: Diet in 
      IBD patients contained significantly less calcium than in healthy controls.
      Gender and age, more than diagnosis, are central in determining inadequate
      calcium intake, more so in IBD. Self-reported lactose intolerance, leading to
      dietary restrictions, is the single major determinant of low calcium intake.
      Inadequate calcium intake is present in one third of IBD patients and represents 
      a reversible risk factor for osteoporosis, suggesting the need for tailored
      nutritional advice in IBD.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Emerging evidence supports an immunologic role for
      25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Here we
      examined if pretreatment vitamin D status influences durability of anti-tumor
      necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha therapy in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) or
      ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: All IBD patients who had plasma 25(OH)D level
      checked <3 months prior to initiating anti-TNF-alpha therapy were included in
      this retrospective single-center cohort study. Our main predictor variable was
      insufficient plasma 25(OH)D (<30 ng/mL). Cox proportional hazards model adjusting
      for potential confounders was used to identify the independent effect of
      pretreatment vitamin D on biologic treatment cessation. RESULTS: Our study
      included 101 IBD patients (74 CD; median disease duration 9 years). The median
      index 25(OH)D level was 27 ng/mL (interquartile range, 20-33 ng/mL). One-third of
      the patients had prior exposure to anti-TNF-alpha therapy. On multivariate
      analysis, patients with insufficient vitamin D demonstrated earlier cessation of 
      anti-TNF-alpha therapy (hazard ratio [HR], 2.13; 95% confidence interval [CI],
      1.03-4.39; P = .04). This effect was significant in patients who stopped
      treatment for loss of response (HR, 3.49; 95% CI, 1.34-9.09) and stronger for CD 
      (HR, 2.38; 95% CI, 0.95-5.99) than UC (P = NS). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest
      that vitamin D levels may influence durability of anti-TNF-alpha induction and
      maintenance therapy. Larger cohort studies and clinical trials of supplemental
      vitamin D use with disease activity as an end point may be warranted.

AB  - Metastasis is the major cause of death in colorectal cancer (CRC). In
      colitis-associated carcinogenesis, the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB
      (NF-kappaB) occurs via lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding to the toll-like receptor
      4 (TLR4). The LPS/TLR4/NF-kappaB pathway contributes to the development and
      metastasis of colitis-associated colon cancer. In the present study, we
      hypothesized that an extracted modified Fuji apple polysaccharide (MAP) would
      alter the LPS/TLR4/NF-kappaB pathway. Thus, we evaluated the effect of MAP in
      vitro on the LPS/TLR4/NF-kappaB pathway in CRC cells (HT-29 and SW620 cells). The
      results suggest that (i) MAP competed with LPS for binding to TLR4 to reduce
      LPS-induced NF-kappaB expression and (ii) MAP suppressed the nuclear
      translocation of NF-kappaB p65. MAP significantly decreased LPS-induced
      expression of TLR4, cyclooxygenase-2, matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), matrix
      metallopeptidase 2, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and prostaglandin E2, and it
      increased the protein expression of the inhibitor of kappaBalpha and NF-kappaB
      p65 in cytoplasm when it was given in combination with LPS. These results
      indicate that MAP suppressed LPS-induced migration and invasiveness of CRC cells 
      by targeting the LPS/TLR4/NF-kappaB pathway. Therefore, we propose that MAP has
      potential for the clinical prevention of CRC cell metastasis.

AB  - Nutmeg (seed of Myristica fragrans [MF]) is one of the most commonly used spices 
      in the world and also a well-known herb for the treatment of various intestinal
      diseases, including colitis in traditional Korean medicine. The purpose of the
      current study was to investigate whether water extract of MF (MFE) can protect
      against dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced colitis in a mouse model. Colitis
      was induced by 5% DSS in balb/c mice. MFE (100, 300 or 1000 mg/kg) was orally
      administered to the mice twice a day for 7 days. Body weight, colon length,
      clinical score, and histological score were assessed to determine the effects on 
      colitis. Proinflammatory cytokines (interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha, interleukin [IL]-1beta, and IL-6) were measured to investigate the 
      mechanisms of action. MFE dose dependently inhibited the colon shortening and
      histological damage to the colon. However, it did not prevent weight loss. MFE
      also inhibited proinflammatory cytokines. The current results suggest that MFE
      ameliorates DSS-induced colitis in mice by inhibiting inflammatory cytokines.
      Further investigation, including the exact mechanisms is needed.

      intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes.
PG  - 2465-76
LID - 10.1084/jem.20122490 [doi]
AB  - NOD2 functions as an intracellular sensor for microbial pathogen and plays an
      important role in epithelial defense. The loss-of-function mutation of NOD2 is
      strongly associated with human Crohn's disease (CD). However, the mechanisms of
      how NOD2 maintains the intestinal homeostasis and regulates the susceptibility of
      CD are still unclear. Here we found that the numbers of intestinal
      intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) were reduced significantly in Nod2(-/-) mice
      and the residual IELs displayed reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis.
      Further study showed that NOD2 signaling maintained IELs via recognition of gut
      microbiota and IL-15 production. Notably, recovery of IELs by adoptive transfer
      could reduce the susceptibility of Nod2(-/-) mice to the 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene
      sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis. Our results demonstrate that recognition of
      gut microbiota by NOD2 is important to maintain the homeostasis of IELs and
      provide a clue that may link NOD2 variation to the impaired innate immunity and
      higher susceptibility in CD.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the spectrum of
      colonic microflora in patients with colitis and if this could be altered with one
      month's treatment with synbiotics. METHODS: This was a pilot study in which
      patients were randomised to either receive a synbiotics preparation for a month
      and then "crossed over" to receive a placebo, or alternatively to receive the
      placebo first followed in the second month by synbiotic. Stool samples were
      collected on entry into the study and then at the end of first and second months 
      respectively. Colonic microflora was measured by terminal restriction fragment
      length polymorphism technique. Quantitative PCR was used to determine the
      concentration of individual species. RESULTS: Sixteen patients completed the
      study of whom 8 had Crohn's colitis and 8 had ulcerative colitis. Their median
      age was 62 (IQR 50-65) years. An average of 22 terminal restriction fragments
      (T-RF's) was identified in each patient. Dice cluster analysis showed that each
      patient had a unique microbial composition which did not change significantly at 
      different time points in the study, irrespective of whether they had probiotics
      or the placebo. Probiotic organisms were identified in stool samples but did not 
      alter overall spectrum of microflora. In this pilot study we were unable to
      identify any specific characteristics related to nature of colitis. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This study suggests that there is no difference in colonic microflora between
      patients with Crohn's or Ulcerative colitis and that the spectrum of bacteria was
      not altered by synbiotic administration.

AB  - The inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn's and ulcerative colitis, are common and a
      significant cause of morbidity. They were rare before the 1930's but the
      incidence has been increasing in both developed and developing countries. We have
      recently reported that the incidence in Nova Scotia, the area with one of the
      highest reported burden globally, is decreasing since 1997. We postulate that
      this decrease may be due to the addition of folate to cereals. This was mandated 
      in 1998 but the process of fortification began in 1997. There is circumstantial
      evidence from epidemiology studies that a diet deficient in folate may have
      contributed to the global rise in these diseases. This hypothesis, if proven to
      be correct, has important implications for the prevention and treatment of these 
      diseases.

TI  - A Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG-derived soluble protein, p40, stimulates ligand
      release from intestinal epithelial cells to transactivate epidermal growth factor
      receptor.
PG  - 30742-51
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M113.492397 [doi]
AB  - p40, a Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG)-derived soluble protein, ameliorates
      intestinal injury and colitis, reduces apoptosis, and preserves barrier function 
      by transactivation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) in intestinal epithelial cells. The
      aim of this study is to determine the mechanisms by which p40 transactivates the 
      EGFR in intestinal epithelial cells. Here we show that p40-conditioned medium
      activates EGFR in young adult mouse colon epithelial cells and human colonic
      epithelial cell line, T84 cells. p40 up-regulates a disintegrin and
      metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 17 (ADAM17) catalytic activity, and
      broad spectrum metalloproteinase inhibitors block EGFR transactivation by p40 in 
      these two cell lines. In ADAM17-deficient mouse colonic epithelial (ADAM17(-/-)
      MCE) cells, p40 transactivation of EGFR is blocked, but can be rescued by
      re-expression with WT ADAM17. Furthermore, p40 stimulates release of heparin
      binding (HB)-EGF, but not transforming growth factor (TGF)alpha or amphiregulin, 
      in young adult mouse colon cells and ADAM17(-/-) MCE cells overexpressing WT
      ADAM17. Knockdown of HB-EGF expression by siRNA suppresses p40 effects on
      transactivating EGFR and Akt, preventing apoptosis, and preserving tight junction
      function. The effects of p40 on HB-EGF release and ADAM17 activation in vivo are 
      examined after administration of p40-containing pectin/zein hydrogel beads to
      mice. p40 stimulates ADAM17 activity and EGFR activation in colonic epithelial
      cells and increases HB-EGF levels in blood from WT mice, but not from mice with
      intestinal epithelial cell-specific ADAM17 deletion. Thus, these data define a
      mechanism of a probiotic-derived soluble protein in modulating intestinal
      epithelial cell homeostasis through ADAM17-mediated HB-EGF release, leading to
      transactivation of EGFR.

LID - 10.1111/petr.12143 [doi]
AB  - Immunosuppression during the post-transplantation period has led to dramatic
      outcome improvements in PLTR patients. There have been reports describing the
      development of food allergies and an increased predilection for development of
      EGI in PLTR. We aimed to identify the clinical, endoscopic and histologic
      features of EGI in PLTR patients. In this retrospective case series we analyzed
      medical record of all PLTR who underwent EGD and/or colonoscopy at our
      institution from 2000 to 2006. From 2000 to 2006, 32 PLTR patients underwent
      endoscopic evaluation. Seventeen (53%) of 32 patients were diagnosed with EGI.
      Endoscopic abnormalities were seen in the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine
      in 11 (65%), 11 (65%), and four (24%) patients, respectively. Eosinophilic
      inflammation was seen in the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine in 13 (76%),
      10 (59%), and five (29%) patients, respectively. Nine of 17 patients underwent
      colonoscopy and endoscopic abnormalities were seen in four (44%) patients. Five
      patients (56%) had eosinophilic inflammation. In conclusion, we have
      characterized the clinical, endoscopic, and histologic features of EGI.
      Histologic and endoscopic examination reveals that, when present, EGI is often
      found at multiple segments along the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  - A decrease of the butyrate-producing species Roseburia hominis and
      Faecalibacterium prausnitzii defines dysbiosis in patients with ulcerative
      colitis.
PG  - 1275-83
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2013-304833 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacteria play an important role in the onset and perpetuation of
      intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Unlike in Crohn's
      disease (CD), in which dysbiosis has been better characterised, in ulcerative
      colitis (UC), only small cohorts have been studied and showed conflicting data.
      Therefore, we evaluated in a large cohort if the microbial signature described in
      CD is also present in UC, and if we could characterise predominant dysbiosis in
      UC. To assess the functional impact of dysbiosis, we quantified the bacterial
      metabolites. DESIGN: The predominant microbiota from 127 UC patients and 87 age
      and sex-matched controls was analysed using denaturing gradient gel
      electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis. Differences were quantitatively validated using 
      real-time PCR. Metabolites were quantified using gas chromatography-mass
      spectrometry. RESULTS: Based on DGGE analysis, the microbial signature previously
      described in CD was not present in UC. Real-time PCR analysis revealed a lower
      abundance of Roseburia hominis (p<0.0001) and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii
      (p<0.0001) in UC patients compared to controls. Both species showed an inverse
      correlation with disease activity. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) were reduced in
      UC patients (p=0.014), but no direct correlation between SCFA and the identified 
      bacteria was found. CONCLUSIONS: The composition of the fecal microbiota of UC
      patients differs from that of healthy individuals: we found a reduction in R
      hominis and F prausnitzii, both well-known butyrate-producing bacteria of the
      Firmicutes phylum. These results underscore the importance of dysbiosis in IBD
      but suggest that different bacterial species contribute to the pathogenesis of UC
      and CD.

TI  - Effects of probiotics and prebiotics in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 540-3
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are caused by the failure of
      immunoregulatory mechanisms due to external environmental factors in genetically 
      predisposed individuals. Probiotics and prebiotics could be used in prevention
      and therapy of many disorders of gastrointestinal tract including ulcerative
      colitis. Probiotics are living microorganisms with good tolerability and minimal 
      risk, which confer a health benefit for the host when administered in adequate
      amounts. Their effect is closely related to maintaining the natural function of
      the intestinal flora. In this respect, they are indispensable prebiotics to
      protect or reduce the incidence of inflammatory lesions in diseases of the
      digestive tract. CONCLUSION: Ingestion of probiotics and prebiotics may provide
      some clues in developing a new class of therapeutic agents for the treatment/
      prevention of IBD and colitis-associated cancer (CAC) in the future (Tab. 2, Ref.
      26).

AB  - Clostridium difficile is a human intestinal pathogen most frequently involved in 
      diarrheal illnesses following the administration of antibiotics. There is growing
      concern that some C difficile infections (CDI) may be acquired from ingestion of 
      C difficile spores in contaminated foods. The number of CDI cases is increasing
      with a heightening in the severity of disease symptoms and an increasing number
      of community-associated infections not connected to health care-associated risk. 
      This article provides an overview of information related to assessing the risk of
      foodborne transmission of CDI, highlighting studies on C difficile relevant to
      food safety in health care settings.

      utility.
PG  - 435268
LID - 10.1155/2013/435268 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases are chronic diseases affecting the gastrointestinal
      tract, whose major forms are represented by Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative
      colitis (UC). Their etiology is still unclear, although several factors have been
      identified as major determinants for induction or relapses. Among these, the role
      of the "forgotten organ", gut microbiota, has become more appreciated in recent
      years. The delicate symbiotic relationship between the gut microbiota and the
      host appears to be lost in IBD. In this perspective, several studies have been
      conducted to assess the role of prebiotics and probiotics in gut microbiota
      modulation. This is a minireview aimed to address in an easy format (simple
      questions-simple answers) some common issues about the theme. An update on the
      role of selected constituents of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBD is
      presented together with the analysis of the efficacy of gut microbiota modulation
      by prebiotics and probiotics administration in the management of IBD.

AB  - Rectal bleeding in neonates is an alarming sign that suggests a possible serious 
      underlying condition, such as infection or bleeding disorder that would
      necessitate hospitalization and prompt intervention. We report a case of
      eosinophilic gastroenteritis caused by cow's milk protein allergy in a one-day-
      old infant, who presented with frankly bloody stools associated with massive
      gastrointestinal and peripheral blood eosinophilia prior to initiation of enteral
      feedings. The patient's outcome was favorable, with complete spontaneous recovery
      in one week, after a period of bowel rest, parenteral nutrition, and use of amino
      acid formula. The eosinophilia was also transient and gradually resolving by two 
      months of age. Rectal bleeding secondary to allergic colitis caused by cow's milk
      sensitization may occur in neonates, and failure to appreciate this possibility
      may lead to inappropriate diagnostic or therapeutic intervention.

PG  - 461-70
LID - 10.1097/QCO.0b013e328363456e [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Clostridium difficile infections (CDIs) are of increasing
      concern in healthcare due to increasing incidence as well as suboptimal response 
      to standard therapies. This review focuses on current updates in chemotherapeutic
      treatment options for primary CDI as well as for relapse. RECENT FINDINGS:
      Metronidazole and vancomycin remain the standard therapy for mild and severe CDI,
      respectively. Fidaxomicin was approved for use in CDI by the US Food and Drug
      Administration in 2011 and new studies have shown a decreased rate of recurrence 
      as compared with vancomycin as well as potential promise for use as a chaser.
      Rifaximin may be useful in salvage therapy for recurrent CDI as well as for a
      chaser. Tigecycline, teicoplanin, doxycycline, linezolid, nitazoxanide,
      amixicile, LFF571, and CB-183 315 have in-vitro activity and are under different 
      stages of study. Monoclonal antitoxin antibodies for prevention of relapse of CDI
      are currently under evaluation in a phase 3 clinical trial. SUMMARY: A variety of
      promising new treatment options for Clostridium difficile are under development, 
      although further studies are necessary to determine the efficacy of these newer
      treatments for cure and preventing disease relapse.

TI  - Gastrointestinal food allergy in infants.
PG  - 297-307
LID - 10.2332/allergolint.13-RA-0542 [doi]
AB  - Food allergies are classified into three types, "IgE-mediated," "combined IgE-
      and cell-mediated" and "cell-mediated/non-IgE-mediated," depending on the
      involvement of IgE in their pathogenesis. Patients who develop predominantly
      cutaneous and/or respiratory symptoms belong to the IgE-mediated food allergy
      type. On the other hand, patients with gastrointestinal food allergy (GI allergy)
      usually develop gastrointestinal symptoms several hours after ingestion of
      offending foods; they belong to the cell-mediated/non-IgE-mediated or combined
      IgE- and cell-mediated food allergy types. GI allergies are also classified into 
      a number of different clinical entities: food protein-induced enterocolitis
      syndrome (FPIES), food protein-induced proctocolitis (FPIP), food protein-induced
      enteropathy (Enteropathy) and eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders (EGID). In 
      the case of IgE-mediated food allergy, the diagnostic approaches and pathogenic
      mechanisms are well characterized. In contrast, the diagnostic approaches and
      pathogenic mechanisms of GI allergy remain mostly unclear. In this review, we
      summarized each type of GI allergy in regard to its historical background and
      updated clinical features, offending foods, etiology, diagnosis, examinations,
      treatment and pathogenesis. There are still many problems, especially in regard
      to the diagnostic approaches for GI allergy, that are closely associated with the
      definition of each disease. In addition, there are a number of unresolved issues 
      regarding the pathogenic mechanisms of GI allergy that need further study and
      elucidation. Therefore, we discussed some of the diagnostic and research issues
      for GI allergy that need further investigation.

PG  - 573576
LID - 10.1155/2013/573576 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dendritic cells regulate immune responses to microbial products and
      play a key role in ulcerative colitis (UC) pathology. We determined the
      immunomodulatory effects of probiotic strain Lactobacillus casei Shirota (LcS) on
      human DC from healthy controls and active UC patients. METHODS: Human blood DC
      from healthy controls (control-DC) and UC patients (UC-DC) were conditioned with 
      heat-killed LcS and used to stimulate allogeneic T cells in a 5-day mixed
      leucocyte reaction. RESULTS: UC-DC displayed a reduced stimulatory capacity for T
      cells (P < 0.05) and enhanced expression of skin-homing markers CLA and CCR4 on
      stimulated T cells (P < 0.05) that were negative for gut-homing marker beta7. LcS
      treatment restored the stimulatory capacity of UC-DC, reflecting that of
      control-DC. LcS treatment conditioned control-DC to induce CLA on T cells in
      conjunction with beta7, generating a multihoming profile, but had no effects on
      UC-DC. Finally, LcS treatment enhanced DC ability to induce TGFbeta production by
      T cells in controls but not UC patients. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a systemic, 
      dysregulated DC function in UC that may account for the propensity of UC patients
      to develop cutaneous manifestations. LcS has multifunctional immunoregulatory
      activities depending on the inflammatory state; therapeutic effects reported in
      UC may be due to promotion of homeostasis.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are based on chronic inflammation in the
      gastrointestinal tract. We previously found anti-inflammatory peptide pyroGlu-Leu
      in the enzymatic hydrolysate of wheat gluten. The objective of present study is
      to elucidate improvement of colitis by oral administration of pyroGlu-Leu in an
      animal model. Acute colitis was induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), and
      various concentrations of pyroGlu-Leu were administrated by oral gavage for 7
      days. A dose of 0.1 mg/kg body weight/day showed the most significant
      improvement. The pyroGlu-Leu concentration was significantly increased 24 h after
      oral administration both in the small intestine and the colon compared with the
      baseline. It was 20-fold higher in the small intestine than the colon.
      Administration of pyroGlu-Leu normalized population of Bacteroidetes and
      Firmicutes in the colon. These results indicate that pyroGlu-Leu has a potential 
      therapeutic effect against IBD at a practical dose.

TI  - The effects of probiotics on barrier function and mucosal pouch microbiota during
      maintenance treatment for severe pouchitis in patients with ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 772-83
LID - 10.1111/apt.12451 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A total of 10-15% of patients with an ileoanal pouch develop severe
      pouchitis necessitating long-term use of antibiotics or pouch excision.
      Probiotics reduce the risk of recurrence of pouchitis, but mechanisms behind
      these effects are not fully understood. AIM: To examine mucosal barrier function 
      in pouchitis, before and after probiotic supplementation and to assess
      composition of mucosal pouch microbiota. METHODS: Sixteen patients with severe
      pouchitis underwent endoscopy with biopsies of the pouch on three occasions:
      during active pouchitis; clinical remission by 4 weeks of antibiotics; after 8
      weeks of subsequent probiotic supplementation (Ecologic 825, Winclove, Amsterdam,
      the Netherlands). Thirteen individuals with a healthy ileoanal pouch were sampled
      once as controls. Ussing chambers were used to assess transmucosal passage of
      Escherichia coli K12, permeability to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and
      (5)(1)Cr-EDTA. Composition and diversity of the microbiota was analysed using
      Human Intestinal Tract Chip. RESULTS: Pouchitis Disease Activity Index (PDAI) was
      significantly improved after antibiotic and probiotic supplementation.
      Escherichia coli K12 passage during active pouchitis [3.7 (3.4-8.5); median
      (IQR)] was significantly higher than in controls [1.7 (1.0-2.4); P < 0.01], did
      not change after antibiotic treatment [5.0 (3.3-7.1); P = ns], but was
      significantly reduced after subsequent probiotic supplementation [2.2 (1.7-3.3); 
      P < 0.05]. No significant effects of antibiotics or probiotics were observed on
      composition of mucosal pouch microbiota; however, E. coli passage correlated with
      bacterial diversity (r = -0.40; P = 0.018). Microbial groups belonging to
      Bacteroidetes and Clostridium clusters IX, XI and XIVa were associated with
      healthy pouches. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics restored the mucosal barrier to E. coli 
      and HRP in patients with pouchitis, a feasible factor in prevention of recurrence
      during maintenance treatment. Restored barrier function did not translate into
      significant changes in mucosal microbiota composition, but bacterial diversity
      correlated with barrier function.

AB  - Imbalances in gut microbiota composition during ulcerative colitis (UC) indicate 
      a role for the microbiota in propagating the disorder. Such effects were
      investigated using in vitro batch cultures (with/without mucin, peptone or
      starch) inoculated with faecal slurries from healthy or UC patients; the growth
      of five bacterial groups was monitored along with short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)
      production. Healthy cultures gave two-fold higher growth and SCFA levels with up 
      to ten-fold higher butyrate production. Starch gave the highest growth and SCFA
      production (particularly butyrate), indicating starch-enhanced saccharolytic
      activity. Sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) were the predominant bacterial group
      (of five examined) for UC inocula whereas they were the minority group for the
      healthy inocula. Furthermore, SRB growth was stimulated by peptone presumably due
      to the presence of sulphur-rich amino acids. The results suggest raised SRB
      levels in UC, which could contribute to the condition through release of toxic
      sulphide.

      released from grapefruit.

AB  - The gut mucosal immune system is considered to play an important role in
      counteracting potential adverse effects of food-derived antigens including
      nanovesicles. Whether nanovesicles naturally released from edible fruit work in a
      coordinated manner with gut immune cells to maintain the gut in a noninflammatory
      status is not known. Here, as proof of concept, we demonstrate that
      grapefruit-derived nanovesicles (GDNs) are selectively taken up by intestinal
      macrophages and ameliorate dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced mouse colitis.
      These effects were mediated by upregulating the expression of heme oxygenase-1
      (HO-1) and inhibiting the production of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha in intestinal
      macrophages. The inherent biocompatibility and biodegradability, stability at
      wide ranges of pH values, and targeting of intestinal macrophages led us to
      further develop a novel GDN-based oral delivery system. Incorporating
      methotrexate (MTX), an anti-inflammatory drug, into GDNs and delivering the
      MTX-GDNs to mice significantly lowered the MTX toxicity when compared with free
      MTX, and remarkably increased its therapeutic effects in DSS-induced mouse
      colitis. These findings demonstrate that GDNs can serve as immune modulators in
      the intestine, maintain intestinal macrophage homeostasis, and can be developed
      for oral delivery of small molecule drugs to attenuate inflammatory responses in 
      human disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the major types of chronic
      inflammatory bowel disease occurring in the colon and small intestine. A growing 
      body of research has proposed that probiotics are able to attenuate the
      inflammatory symptoms of these diseases in vitro and in vivo. However, the
      mechanism of probiotic actions remains unclear. RESULTS: Our results suggested
      Lactobacillus plantarum MYL26 inhibited inflammation in Caco-2 cells through
      regulation of gene expressions of TOLLIP, SOCS1, SOCS3, and IkappaBalpha, rather 
      than SHIP-1 and IRAK-3. CONCLUSIONS: We proposed that live/ heat-killed
      Lactobacillus plantarum MYL26 and bacterial cell wall extract treatments impaired
      TLR4-NFkappab signal transduction through Tollip, SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 activation,
      thus inducing LPS tolerance. Our findings suggest that either heat-killed
      probiotics or probiotic cell wall extracts are able to attenuate inflammation
      through pathways similar to that of live bacteria.

TI  - A prospective study of long-term intake of dietary fiber and risk of Crohn's
      disease and ulcerative colitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Increased intake of dietary fiber has been proposed to reduce 
      the risk of inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease [CD] and ulcerative
      colitis [UC]). However, few prospective studies have examined associations
      between long-term intake of dietary fiber and risk of incident CD or UC. METHODS:
      We collected and analyzed data from 170,776 women, followed up over 26 years, who
      participated in the Nurses' Health Study, followed up for 3,317,425 person-years.
      Dietary information was prospectively ascertained via administration of a
      validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire every 4 years.
      Self-reported CD and UC were confirmed through review of medical records. Cox
      proportional hazards models, adjusting for potential confounders, were used to
      calculate hazard ratios (HRs). RESULTS: We confirmed 269 incident cases of CD
      (incidence, 8/100,000 person-years) and 338 cases of UC (incidence, 10/100,000
      person-years). Compared with the lowest quintile of energy-adjusted cumulative
      average intake of dietary fiber, intake of the highest quintile (median of 24.3
      g/day) was associated with a 40% reduction in risk of CD (multivariate HR for CD,
      0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.39-0.90). This apparent reduction appeared to be
      greatest for fiber derived from fruits; fiber from cereals, whole grains, or
      legumes did not modify risk. In contrast, neither total intake of dietary fiber
      (multivariate HR, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.58-1.17) nor intake of fiber
      from specific sources appeared to be significantly associated with risk of UC.
      CONCLUSIONS: Based on data from the Nurses' Health Study, long-term intake of
      dietary fiber, particularly from fruit, is associated with lower risk of CD but
      not UC. Further studies are needed to determine the mechanisms that mediate this 
      association.

AB  - Ulcerative colitis diagnosis and management represent a challenge for clinicians.
      The disguises of ischemia and acute infectious colitis continue to confound the
      diagnosis. The therapeutic options have remarkably expanded in the way of
      immunomodulators, biologics, or ileoanal pouch surgery, yet all carry potential
      considerable risks. These risks can confuse and impair patient acceptance,
      particularly elderly patients and men younger than 30 years. Predictors of
      outcome of medical and surgical therapy have improved but are far from complete. 
      Nevertheless, therapies focused on the specific patient's condition continue to
      offer hope.

AB  - The protective effect of hydroalcoholic extract of hawthorn berries (HBE) on
      acetic acid (AA)-induced colitis in rats was investigated. Forty-two Wistar rats 
      were divided into seven groups, including control and test groups (n=6). The
      control animals received saline, and the test animals were treated with saline
      (sham group), mesalamine (50 mg/kg; M group), atorvastatin (20 mg/kg; A group),
      HBE (100 mg/kg; H group), mesalamine and HBE (HM group), or atorvastatin plus HBE
      (HA group), 3 days before and a week after colitis induction. Colitis was induced
      by administration of 1 mL AA (4%) via a polyethylene catheter intrarectally.
      High-performance liquid chromatography analyses showed that HBE contained 0.13%
      and 0.5% oleanolic acid and ursolic acid, respectively. Elevated myeloperoxidase 
      activity and lipid peroxidation were attenuated in the HA group. The H and HM
      groups showed marked reductions in colitis-induced decreases in total thiol
      molecules and body weight. The histopathological studies revealed that HBE
      decreased colitis-induced edema and infiltration of neutrophils. Our data suggest
      the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of HBE and atorvastatin protect
      against AA-induced colitis. The anti-inflammatory effect of HBE may be
      attributable to its ability to decrease myeloperoxidase activity as a biomarker
      of neutrophil infiltration.

TI  - The complex dynamics of antimicrobial activity in the human gastrointestinal
      tract.
PG  - 123-32
AB  - The human gastrointestinal tract is a complex environment of mutualistic
      associations. As bacteria form a major component of fecal content, the natural
      balance of the colon can be significantly altered by exposure to antimicrobial
      agents. However, the effects of antimicrobial therapy on fecal content are
      difficult to predict and can at times be quite surprising. The emergence and
      spread of vancomycin-resistant enterococci are cases in point. Resistance to the 
      glycopeptide vancomycin emerged in enterococci (primarily in Enterococcus
      faecium) in the late 1980s in both Europe and the United States. In Europe, this 
      emergence was tied to the use of the glycopeptide antibiotic avoparcin to promote
      growth in food animals and had little actual impact on hospital infections. In
      the United States, where avoparcin has never been licensed, vancomycin-resistant 
      enterococci (VRE) emerged as a major hospital pathogen. Paradoxically, while the 
      initial entry of the vancomycin resistance determinants into enterococci was
      almost certainly driven by high fecal concentrations of vancomycin associated
      with treatment for Clostridium difficile colitis, clinical infection and
      outbreaks were more frequently tied to use of extended-spectrum cephalosporins
      and agents with potent activity against anaerobic bacteria. Animal studies
      suggest that cephalosporins promote initial VRE colonization because of the
      frequent concomitant high-level resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics expressed
      by these strains. Anti-anaerobic agents appear to increase the output of VRE in
      the feces, presumably by reducing the number of competitive flora in the colon.
      Intravenously administered vancomycin appears to have little impact because it
      achieves negligible concentrations in the feces after short courses. Thus, the
      spread of glycopeptide resistance in enterococci is promoted in a large measure
      by the administration of non-glycopeptide antibiotics.

AB  - Host inflammation alters the availability of nutrients such as iron to limit
      microbial growth. However, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium thrives in the
      inflamed gut by scavenging for iron with siderophores. By administering
      Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917, which assimilates iron by similar
      mechanisms, we show that this nonpathogenic bacterium can outcompete and reduce
      S. Typhimurium colonization in mouse models of acute colitis and chronic
      persistent infection. This probiotic activity depends on E. coli Nissle iron
      acquisition, given that mutants deficient in iron uptake colonize the intestine
      but do not reduce S. Typhimurium colonization. Additionally, the ability of E.
      coli Nissle to overcome iron restriction by the host protein lipocalin 2, which
      counteracts some siderophores, is essential, given that S. Typhimurium is
      unaffected by E. coli Nissle in lipocalin 2-deficient mice. Thus, iron
      availability impacts S. Typhimurium growth, and E. coli Nissle reduces S.
      Typhimurium intestinal colonization by competing for this limiting nutrient.

      explanation underlying the benefits of certain probiotic bacteria. Intestinal
      bacteria compete for the essential nutrient iron, leading to replacement of
      pathogenic Salmonella by the probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle, which is better
      equipped with iron acquisition systems, and resolution of infectious colitis.

TI  - Gut microbiota imbalance and chaperoning system malfunction are central to
      ulcerative colitis pathogenesis and can be counteracted with specifically
      designed probiotics: a working hypothesis.
PG  - 393-406
LID - 10.1007/s00430-013-0305-2 [doi]
AB  - In this work, we propose that for further studies of the physiopathology and
      treatment for inflammatory bowel diseases, an integral view of the conditions,
      including the triad of microbiota-heat shock proteins (HSPs)-probiotics, ought to
      be considered. Microbiota is the complex microbial flora that resides in the gut,
      affecting not only gut functions but also the health status of the whole body.
      Alteration in the microbiota's composition has been implicated in a variety of
      pathological conditions (e.g., ulcerative colitis, UC), involving both gut and
      extra-intestinal tissues and organs. Some of these pathologies are also
      associated with an altered expression of HSPs (chaperones) and this is the reason
      why they may be considered chaperonopathies. Probiotics, which are live
      microorganisms able to restore the correct, healthy equilibrium of microbiota
      composition, can ameliorate symptoms in patients suffering from UC and modulate
      expression levels of HSPs. However, currently probiotic therapy follows
      ex-adiuvantibus criteria, i.e., treatments with beneficial effects but whose
      mechanism of action is unknown, which should be changed so the probiotics needed 
      in each case are predetermined on the basis of the patient's microbiota.
      Consequently, efforts are necessary to develop diagnostic tools for elucidating
      levels and distribution of HSPs and the microbiota composition (microbiota
      fingerprint) of each subject and, thus, guide specific probiotic therapy,
      tailored to meet the needs of the patient. Microbiota fingerprinting ought to
      include molecular biology techniques for sequencing highly conserved DNA, e.g.,
      genes encoding 16S RNA, for species identification and, in addition,
      quantification of each relevant microbe.

AB  - Food-grade lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are good candidates for the development of 
      oral vectors, and are attractive alternatives to attenuated pathogens, for
      mucosal delivery strategies. In this review, we summarize recent results on the
      use of LAB as mucosal delivery vectors for therapeutic proteins and DNA vaccines.
      Most of this work has been based on the model LAB, Lactococcus lactis, which is
      suitable for the heterologous expression of therapeutic proteins. Recombinant
      lactococci and lactobacilli strains expressing antiproteases and antioxidant
      enzymes have been tested successfully for their prophylactic and therapeutic
      effects in murine models of colitis. Recombinant lactococci secreting
      autoantigens have been found to be effective for the treatment of type 1
      diabetes. Also, recombinant lactococci delivering DNA were able to prevent a
      bovine beta-lactoglobulin (BLG)-allergic reaction in mice. We believe that these 
      various coherent findings demonstrate the potential value of using LAB,
      particularly lactococci and lactobacilli strains, to develop novel vectors for
      the therapeutic delivery of proteins to mucosal surfaces. Further tests and in
      particular human clinical trials are now important next steps to conclude on the 
      benefit of these approaches for human health.

AB  - Allergic colitis is a clinical manifestation of food allergy during the first
      months of life. It is estimated that genetic factors play a role in the
      expression of this allergic disease. This case report described the clinical
      progress of infants who were cousins from two distinct family groups with
      allergic colitis. Five infants under six months of age and of both sexes were
      studied, with a diagnosis of allergic colitis characterized clinically and
      histologically by (1) rectal bleeding; (2) exclusion of infectious causes of
      colitis; (3) disappearance of symptoms after elimination of cow's milk and dairy 
      products from the child's and/or the mother's diet. Patients were submitted to
      the following diagnostic investigation: complete blood count; stool culture;
      parasitologic examination of stools; rectoscopy or colonoscopy; and rectal
      biopsy. Patient age varied from 40 days to six months; three were males. All
      patients presented with complaints of intense colic and rectal bleeding. The
      colonoscopy showed presence of hyperemia of the mucosa with microerosions and
      spontaneous bleeding upon the procedure. Microscopy revealed the existence of
      colitis with eosinophilia > 20 e/HPF. Patients were treated with a hypoallergenic
      formula and showed remission of symptoms. After one year of age, all were
      submitted to an oral challenge with a milk formula and presented food tolerance. 
      Allergic colitis is a disease with evident genetic inheritance and a temporary
      character.

TI  - Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 modulates host inflammatory processes beyond the
      gut.
PG  - 325-39
LID - 10.4161/gmic.25487 [doi]
AB  - Certain therapeutic microbes, including Bifidobacteria infantis (B. infantis)
      35624 exert beneficial immunoregulatory effects by mimicking commensal-immune
      interactions; however, the value of these effects in patients with
      non-gastrointestinal inflammatory conditions remains unclear. In this study, we
      assessed the impact of oral administration of B. infantis 35624, for 68 weeks on 
      inflammatory biomarker and plasma cytokine levels in patients with ulcerative
      colitis (UC) (n = 22), chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) (n = 48) and psoriasis (n =
      26) in three separate randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled interventions.
      Additionally, the effect of B. infantis 35624 on immunological biomarkers in
      healthy subjects (n = 22) was assessed. At baseline, both gastrointestinal (UC)
      and non-gastrointestinal (CFS and psoriasis) patients had significantly increased
      plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and the pro-inflammatory cytokines
      tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) compared with
      healthy volunteers. B. infantis 35624 feeding resulted in reduced plasma CRP
      levels in all three inflammatory disorders compared with placebo. Interestingly, 
      plasma TNF-alpha was reduced in CFS and psoriasis while IL-6 was reduced in UC
      and CFS. Furthermore, in healthy subjects, LPS-stimulated TNF-alpha and IL-6
      secretion by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was significantly reduced
      in the B. infantis 35624-treated groups compared with placebo following eight
      weeks of feeding. These results demonstrate the ability of this microbe to reduce
      systemic pro-inflammatory biomarkers in both gastrointestinal and
      non-gastrointestinal conditions. In conclusion, these data show that the
      immunomodulatory effects of the microbiota in humans are not limited to the
      mucosal immune system but extend to the systemic immune system.

TI  - Characteristics of allergic colitis in breast-fed infants in the absence of cow's
      milk allergy.
PG  - 3824-30
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v19.i24.3824 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To investigate the characteristics of mucosal lesions and their relation to 
      laboratory data and long-term follow up in breast-fed infants with allergic
      colitis. METHODS: In this study 31 breast-fed infants were prospectively
      evaluated (mean age, 17.4 wk) whose rectal bleeding had not ceased after a
      maternal elimination diet for cow's milk. Thirty-four age-matched and breast-fed 
      infants (mean age, 16.9 wk) with no rectal bleeding were enrolled for laboratory 
      testing as controls. Laboratory findings, colonoscopic and histological
      characteristics were prospectively evaluated in infants with rectal bleeding.
      Long-term follow-up with different nutritional regimes (L-amino-acid based
      formula or breastfeeding) was also included. RESULTS: Iron deficiency, peripheral
      eosinophilia and thrombocytosis were significantly higher in patients with
      allergic colitis in comparison to controls (8.4 +/- 3.2 mumol/L vs 13.7 +/- 4.7
      mumol/L, P < 0.001; 0.67 +/- 0.49 G/L vs 0.33 +/- 0.17 G/L, P < 0.001; 474 +/-
      123 G/L vs 376 +/- 89 G/L, P < 0.001, respectively). At colonoscopy,
      lymphonodular hyperplasia or aphthous ulceration were present in 83% of patients.
      Twenty-two patients were given L-amino acid-based formula and 8 continued the
      previous feeding. Time to cessation of rectal bleeding was shorter in the special
      formula feeding group (mean, 1.4 wk; range, 0.5-3 wk) when compared with the
      breast-feeding group (mean, 5.3 wk; range, 2-9 wk). Nevertheless, none of the
      patients exhibited rectal bleeding at the 3-mo visit irrespective of the type of 
      feeding. Peripheral eosinophilia and cessation of rectal bleeding after
      administration of elemental formula correlated with a higher density of mucosal
      eosinophils. CONCLUSION: Infant hematochezia, after cow's milk allergy exclusion,
      is generally a benign and probably self-limiting disorder despite marked mucosal 
      abnormality. Formula feeding results in shorter time to cessation of rectal
      bleeding; however, breast-feeding should not be discouraged in long-lasting
      hematochezia.

      acids in gut inflammation and obesity.
PG  - 2756-66
LID - 10.1007/s10620-013-2744-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The lumen of the gastrointestinal tract contains many substances
      produced from the breakdown of foodstuffs, from salivary, esophageal, intestinal,
      hepatic, and pancreatic secretions, and from sloughed cells present in the
      gastrointestinal lumen. Although these substances were traditionally regarded as 
      waste products, there is increasing realization that many can be biologically
      active, either as signalling compounds or as nutrients. For example, proteins are
      broken down into amino acids, which are then sensed by nutrient receptors. The
      gut microbiome, which is at highest abundance in the ileocecum, has powerful
      metabolic activity, digesting and breaking down unabsorbed carbohydrates,
      proteins, and other ingested nutrients into phenols, amines, volatile organic
      compounds, methane, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and hydrogen sulfide into volatile 
      fatty acids, also called short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). CONCLUSION: These
      latter substances are the topic of this review. In this review, we will briefly
      discuss recent advances in the understanding SCFA production, signalling, and
      absorption, followed by a detailed description and discussion of trials of SCFAs,
      probiotics, and prebiotics in the treatment of gastrointestinal disease, in
      particular ulcerative colitis (UC), pouchitis, short bowel syndrome, and obesity.

      disease.
PG  - 776-84

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dietary fats influence intestinal inflammation and regulate mucosal
      immunity. Data on the association between dietary fat and risk of Crohn's disease
      (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are limited and conflicting. METHODS: We
      conducted a prospective study of women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study
      cohorts. Diet was prospectively ascertained every 4 years using a validated
      semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Self-reported CD and UC were
      confirmed through medical record review. We examined the effect of
      energy-adjusted cumulative average total fat intake and specific types of fat and
      fatty acids on the risk of CD and UC using Cox proportional hazards models
      adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: Among 170,805 women, we confirmed
      269 incident cases of CD (incidence 8/100,000 person-years) and 338 incident
      cases of UC (incidence 10/100,000 person-years) over 26 years and 3,317,338
      person-years of follow-up. Cumulative energy-adjusted intake of total fat,
      saturated fats, unsaturated fats, n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)
      were not associated with risk of CD or UC. However, greater intake of long-chain 
      n-3 PUFAs was associated with a trend towards lower risk of UC (HR 0.72, 95% CI
      0.51 to 1.01). In contrast, high long-term intake of trans-unsaturated fatty
      acids was associated with a trend towards an increased incidence of UC (HR 1.34, 
      95% CI 0.94 to 1.92). CONCLUSIONS: A high intake of dietary long-chain n-3 PUFAs 
      may be associated with a reduced risk of UC. In contrast, high intake of
      trans-unsaturated fats may be associated with an increased risk of UC.

PG  - 190-9
LID - 10.1177/0885066613475426 [doi]
AB  - Approaches for management of Clostridium difficile infection continually evolve
      as research reveals shifts in epidemiology, microbial pathogenesis, disease
      severity states, and response to therapy. These new discoveries significantly
      impact diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, given the high morbidity associated
      with this common nosocomial infectious diarrhea. Critically ill patients are at
      an increased risk of developing diarrheal illness like C. difficile and
      succumbing to potentially fatal complications of this infection. Early diagnosis 
      of severe disease state may improve patient outcomes. In this article, we review 
      treatment strategies and new approaches for the management of C. difficile in
      critically ill patients.

TI  - Inadequate nutrient intake in patients with celiac disease: results from a German
      dietary survey.
PG  - 240-6
LID - 10.1159/000348850 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently, the only treatment for celiac disease (CD) is a lifelong
      gluten-free diet (GFD). Research has been carried out in various countries into
      the nutritional adequacy of the GFD in terms of macro- and micronutrients, mostly
      presenting conflicting results. However, no data for Germany are available to
      date. AIM: To elucidate the nutritional composition of a GFD and to compare it
      with non-GFD in a representative German non-CD population. METHODS AND PATIENTS: 
      A total of 1,000 patients who were members of the German Celiac Society (DZG)
      were invited to fill out a prospective 7-day food diary and a questionnaire. Data
      from 88 patients aged 14-80 years were analyzed and compared to the DACH
      reference values and to data from the German National Diet and Nutrition Survey
      (NVS II). RESULTS: No significant difference was observed for the intake of
      energy and macronutrients in male celiac patients compared to the NVS II. Only
      the fiber intake of male patients was significantly lower than that of the
      general population. Female patients, however, showed a significantly higher fat
      intake, but lower carbohydrate consumption. The average daily micronutrient
      intake of male and female patients, specifically of vitamin B1, B2, B6, folic
      acid, magnesium and iron, was significantly lower in celiac patients compared to 
      the NVS II. CONCLUSION: This study reveals inadequate nutrient intake by male and
      female celiac patients in Germany. Based on our findings, regular (laboratory)
      monitoring of celiac patients should be recommended.

TI  - Low and medium but not high doses of green tea polyphenols ameliorated dextran
      sodium sulfate-induced hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity.
PG  - 1223-8
AB  - Our previous study indicated that a diet containing a high dose (1%) of green tea
      polyphenols (GTPs) disrupted liver and kidney function via a reduction in
      antioxidant enzyme and heat shock protein (HSP) levels in both colitis and
      non-treated ICR mice. In the present study, we assessed the effects of 0.01%,
      0.1%, and 1% dietary GTPs on liver and kidney physiological functioning in
      dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-exposed and normal mice. GTPs at 0.01% and 0.1%
      significantly suppressed DSS-increased serum aspartate 2-oxoglutarate
      aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. In contrast,
      GTPs at 1% increased kidney weight, serum creatinine levels, and thiobarbituric
      acid-reactive substances (TBARs) in both the kidney and the liver in normal mice,
      as compared with DSS-exposed mice. GTPs at 0.01% and 0.1% remarkably upregulated 
      the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) mRNA 
      in the liver and kidney of mice exposed to DSS, whereas GTPs at 1% abolished it. 
      Our results indicate that low and medium doses of GTPs have beneficial effects on
      DSS-induced hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity via upregulation of self-protective
      enzymes, while these effects disappeared at a high dose.

AB  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) strains are food borne pathogens with
      importance in public health. EHEC colonizes the large intestine and causes
      diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis and in some cases, life-threatening
      hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) due to the production of Shiga toxins (Stx). The 
      lack of effective clinical treatment, sequelae after infection and mortality rate
      in humans supports the urgent need of prophylactic approaches, such as
      development of vaccines. Shedding from cattle, the main EHEC reservoir and
      considered the principal food contamination source, has prompted the development 
      of licensed vaccines that reduce EHEC colonization in ruminants. Although murine 
      models do not fully recapitulate human infection, they are commonly used to
      evaluate EHEC vaccines and the immune/protective responses elicited in the host. 
      Mice susceptibility differs depending of the EHEC inoculums; displaying different
      mortality rates and Stx-mediated renal damage. Therefore, several experimental
      protocols have being pursued in this model to develop EHEC-specific vaccines.
      Recent candidate vaccines evaluated include those composed of virulence factors
      alone or as fused-subunits, DNA-based, attenuated bacteria and bacterial ghosts. 
      In this review, we summarize progress in the design and testing of EHEC vaccines 
      and the use of different strategies for the evaluation of novel EHEC vaccines in 
      the murine model.

TI  - Probiotic yeast inhibits VEGFR signaling and angiogenesis in intestinal
      inflammation.
PG  - e64227
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0064227 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Saccharomyces boulardii (Sb) can protect against intestinal 
      injury and tumor formation, but how this probiotic yeast controls protective
      mucosal host responses is unclear. Angiogenesis is an integral process of
      inflammatory responses in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and required for
      mucosal remodeling during restitution. The aim of this study was to determine
      whether Sb alters VEGFR (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor) signaling, 
      a central regulator of angiogenesis. METHODS: HUVEC were used to examine the
      effects of Sb on signaling and on capillary tube formation (using the ECMatrix
      system). The effects of Sb on VEGF-mediated angiogenesis were examined in vivo
      using an adenovirus expressing VEGF-A(164) in the ears of adult nude mice (NuNu).
      The effects of Sb on blood vessel volume branching and density in DSS-induced
      colitis was quantified using VESsel GENeration (VESGEN) software. RESULTS: 1) Sb 
      treatment attenuated weight-loss (p<0.01) and histological damage (p<0.01) in DSS
      colitis. VESGEN analysis of angiogenesis showed significantly increased blood
      vessel density and volume in DSS-treated mice compared to control. Sb treatment
      significantly reduced the neo-vascularization associated with acute DSS colitis
      and accelerated mucosal recovery restoration of the lamina propria capillary
      network to a normal morphology. 2) Sb inhibited VEGF-induced angiogenesis in vivo
      in the mouse ear model. 3) Sb also significantly inhibited angiogenesis in vitro 
      in the capillary tube assay in a dose-dependent manner (p<0.01). 4) In HUVEC, Sb 
      reduced basal VEGFR-2 phosphorylation, VEGFR-2 phosphorylation in response to
      VEGF as well as activation of the downstream kinases PLCgamma and Erk1/2.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the probiotic yeast S boulardii can
      modulate angiogenesis to limit intestinal inflammation and promote mucosal tissue
      repair by regulating VEGFR signaling.

TI  - Altered plasma concentrations of trace elements in ulcerative colitis patients
      before and after surgery.
PG  - 100-4
LID - 10.1007/s12011-013-9662-3 [doi]
AB  - Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is a classical surgery for ulcerative colitis
      patients. However, knowledge on trace element alteration in patients who had
      undergone this surgery is limited. This study was conducted to assess trace
      element alteration in patients with ulcerative colitis before and after ileal
      pouch-anal anastomosis. Preoperative (40) and postoperative (35) ulcerative
      colitis patients were studied. The dietary assessment of trace element intake was
      undertaken by a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. Patients' trace
      element status of zinc, copper, manganese, selenium, calcium, iron, and vitamin
      D3 was assessed by measuring their blood concentrations. We found that with the
      similar dietary intake, there was no statistical difference in the concentrations
      of plasma copper, iron, calcium, and vitamin D3 in the two groups (P > 0.05).
      Compared with preoperative patients, postoperative patients had higher
      concentrations of plasma zinc (14.51 +/- 4.75 mumol/l) and manganese (0.21 +/-
      0.11 mumol/l) and lower concentrations of plasma selenium (0.86 +/- 0.58
      mumol/l). Both preoperative and postoperative mean concentrations of plasma
      calcium and vitamin D3 were below their reference range, respectively. We
      conclude that IPAA does not seem to alter patients' abnormal trace elements
      completely. It is important to monitor and supply some specified trace elements
      even in postoperative patients.

AB  - AIMS: To further explore the anti-inflammatory properties of d-Limonene. MAIN
      METHODS: A rat model was used to compare evolution of TNBS (2,5,6-trinitrobenzene
      sulfonic acid)-induced colitis after oral feeding with d-Limonene compared to
      ibuprofen. Peripheral levels of TNF-alpha (Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha) were
      assessed in all animals. Cell cultures of fibroblasts and enterocytes were used
      to test the effect of d-Limonene respectively on TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB
      (nuclear factor-kappa B) translocation and epithelial resistance. Finally,
      plasmatic inflammatory markers were examined in an observational study of diet
      supplementation with d-Limonene-containing orange peel extract (OPE) in humans.
      KEY FINDINGS: Administered per os at a dose of 10mg/kg p.o., d-Limonene induced a
      significant reduction of intestinal inflammatory scores, comparable to that
      induced by ibuprofen. Moreover, d-Limonene-fed rats had significantly lowered
      serum concentrations of TNF-alpha compared to untreated TNBS-colitis rats. The
      anti-inflammatory effect of d-Limonene also involved inhibition of
      TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB translocation in fibroblast cultures. The application 
      of d-Limonene on colonic HT-29/B6 cell monolayers increased epithelial
      resistance. Finally, inflammatory markers, especially peripheral IL-6, markedly
      decreased upon OPE supplementation of elderly healthy subjects submitted or not
      to 56 days of dietary supplementation with OPE. SIGNIFICANCE: In conclusion,
      d-Limonene indeed demonstrates significant anti-inflammatory effects both in vivo
      and in vitro. Protective effects on the epithelial barrier and decreased
      cytokines are involved, suggesting a beneficial role of d-Limonene as diet
      supplement in reducing inflammation.

TI  - The peptide transporter PEPT1 is expressed in distal colon in rodents and humans 
      and contributes to water absorption.
PG  - G66-73
LID - 10.1152/ajpgi.00491.2012 [doi]
AB  - The peptide transporter PEPT1, expressed in the brush border membrane of
      enterocytes, mediates the uptake of di- and tripeptides from luminal protein
      digestion in the small intestine. PEPT1 was proposed not to be expressed in
      normal colonic mucosa but may become detectable in inflammatory states such as
      Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. We reassessed colonic expression of PEPT1 
      by performing a systematic analysis of PEPT1 mRNA and protein levels in healthy
      colonic tissues in mice, rats, and humans. Immunofluorescence analysis of
      different mouse strains (C57BL/6N, 129/Sv, BALB/c) demonstrated the presence of
      PEPT1 in the distal part of the colon but not in proximal colon. Rat and human
      intestines display a similar distribution of PEPT1 as found in mice. However,
      localization in human sigmoid colon revealed immunoreactivity present at low
      levels in apical membranes but substantial staining in distinct intracellular
      compartments. Functional activity of PEPT1 in colonic tissues from mice was
      assessed in everted sac preparations using [(1)(4)C]Gly-Sar and found to be
      5.7-fold higher in distal compared with proximal colon. In intestinal tissues
      from Pept1-/- mice, no [(1)(4)C]Gly-Sar transport was detectable but feces
      samples revealed significantly higher water content than in wild-type mice,
      suggesting that PEPT1 contributes to colonic water absorption. In conclusion, our
      studies unequivocally demonstrate the presence of PEPT1 protein in healthy distal
      colonic epithelium in mice, rats, and humans and proved that the protein is
      functional and contributes to electrolyte and water handling in mice.

TI  - [Antibiotic-associated diarrhea in clinical practice].
PG  - 85-8
AB  - Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) is considered to mean at least 3 shapeless
      stool episodes within 2 or more consecutive days when using antibacterial agents.
      Due to the fact that antibiotics are used most commonly to treat many diseases,
      AAD is one of the topical problems for different clinical specialists. There has 
      recently been increased interest in this condition due to its higher morbidity
      and mortality rates and the emergence of novel treatment-resistant virulent
      strains of Clostridium difficile 027 and 078/126. The paper discusses the
      possible risk of developing AAD depending on the class of the antibiotic used, as
      well as the mechanisms of its development. Infectious diarrhea most frequently
      results from bacterial overgrowth due to that the obligate intestinal microflora 
      is suppressed by antibacterial drugs. C. difficile, Clostridium perfringers,
      Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp., Klebsiella oxytoca, and Candida spp. are 
      etiological factors in the development of this diarrhea. The severest intestinal 
      lesions include pseudomembranous colitis (PMC) caused by C. difficile. The
      clinical and endoscopic picture and methods for the diagnosis and treatment of
      PMC are described. Therapy for this menacing condition is traditionally based on 
      the use of metronidazole and vancomycin. In 2011, the US Food and Drug
      Administration approved the new drug fidaxomycin whose superiority over
      vancomycin has been demonstrated by a recurrence criterion. The paper discusses
      in detail other treatment options, including the use of probiotics.

AB  - The pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease is still incompletely
      understood. While the development of the immune system and the establishment of
      the microflora take place during infancy young patients often have a more severe 
      and extensive disease. The differences in composition and concentration of
      intestinal microbiota and aberrant immune responses towards the luminal bacteria 
      prompted the concept of an 'ecological' approach to control the disease course.
      Probiotics, living, non pathogenic micro organisms with a beneficial effect on
      the host, and prebiotics, oligosaccharides promoting the growth of the beneficial
      microflora, have been studied to this effect. Results have so far been
      disappointing for Crohn's disease but encouraging for ulcerative colitis. An
      overview of studies using probiotics in adults or children and a perspective on
      specific pediatric issues is provided in this review.

TI  - Faecalibacterium prausnitzii upregulates regulatory T cells and anti-inflammatory
      cytokines in treating TNBS-induced colitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (F. prausnitzii) is a common
      anaerobic bacteria colonized in the human gut and inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) patients are usually lack of F. prausnitzii. The aims of this study were to
      evaluate the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory capacity of F. prausnitzii by
      comparing it with Bifidobacterium longum (B. longum) in both cellular and animal 
      experiments. METHODS: Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and 2, 4, 
      6-trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis rat models were treated
      with F. prausnitzii, B. longum, F. prausnitzii supernatant or F. prausnitzii
      medium, respectively. Interleukin (IL)-10, TGF-beta1 and IL-12p70 in human PBMCs 
      culture supernatant and rat blood serum were detected. The frequency of
      CD25(+)Foxp3(+)Treg in human PBMCs, rat PBMCs and rat splenocytes were
      investigated. Besides, the T-bet, GATA-3, ROR-gammat and Foxp3 mRNA in human
      PBMCs, histopathologic characteristics of the intestinal mucosal and weight loss 
      in the rat models were examined. RESULTS: F. prausnitzii, B. longum and F.
      prausnitzii supernatant clearly facilitated the induction of IL-10 and TGF-beta1,
      while induced relatively mild production of IL-12p70 in both cellular and animal 
      models. The F. prausnitzii, B. longum and supernatant differed in their capacity 
      to induce T-bet, GATA-3 and ROR-gammat mRNA expression in human PBMCs (both
      bacterial strains inhibited the expression of ROR-gammat while supernatant
      inhibited the T-bet and GATA-3). However, all of them induced the Foxp3 and Treg 
      production and ameliorated the TNBS-induced colitis. In addition, F. prausnitzii 
      supernatant exhibited the supreme anti-inflammatory capacity. CONCLUSIONS: F.
      prausnitzii and its unidentified metabolites in the supernatant are promising
      candidates in treating IBD, and further research remains necessary to elucidate
      the safety, efficacy, optimum and mechanism of this bacterium in the clinical
      practice.

TI  - Ulcerative colitis: prevention of relapse.
PG  - 341-51
LID - 10.1586/egh.13.18 [doi]
AB  - The clinical management of ulcerative colitis (UC) involves first treating the
      acute symptoms to induce remission, and then successfully maintaining it. Oral
      5-aminosalicylic acids are safe and useful for maintaining remission in patients 
      with UC. In terms of adherence, a once-daily form of 5-aminosalicylic acid is
      superior in maintaining remission as compared with split dosing. Patients at high
      risk of relapse may be candidates for treatment with thiopurines and/or biologics
      in the early stages of UC. Calcineurin inhibitors, such as cyclosporine and
      tacrolimus, are effective for severe, steroid-refractory UC patients. It is
      suggested that these patients use thiopurines as their maintenance therapy once
      they achieve remission with calcineurin inhibitors. Recent studies have confirmed
      that biologics are effective for inducing clinical and endoscopic remission of
      UC, and thus they may improve long-term prognosis of UC.

      adalimumab.
PG  - 289-96
LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S33197 [doi]
AB  - The treatment of ulcerative colitis has changed over the last decade, with the
      introduction of biological drugs. This article reviews the currently available
      therapies for ulcerative colitis and the specific use of these therapies in the
      management of patients in different settings, particularly the difficult-to-treat
      patients. The focus of this review is on adalimumab, which has recently obtained 
      approval by the European Medicines Agency and the US Food and Drug
      Administration, for use in treating adult patients with moderate-to-severe,
      active ulcerative colitis, who are refractory, intolerant, or who have
      contraindications to conventional therapy, including corticosteroids and
      thiopurines. Since the results emerging from the pivotal trials have been subject
      to some debate, the aim of this review was to summarize all available data on the
      use of adalimumab in ulcerative colitis, focusing also on a retrospective series 
      of real-life experiences. Taken together, the current evidence indicates that
      adalimumab is effective for the treatment of patients with different types of
      ulcerative colitis, including biologically naive and difficult-to-treat patients.

TI  - Janus kinase inhibition with tofacitinib: changing the face of inflammatory bowel
      disease treatment.
PG  - 1385-91
AB  - The advent of anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) therapy has changed the way of
      treating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, primary and secondary failure
      are relatively frequent with all anti-TNF agents, which are available only as
      parenteral agents. Tofacitinib is an oral janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that
      inhibits JAK family kinase members, in particular JAK1 and JAK3, achieving a
      broad limitation of inflammation by interfering with several cytokine receptors. 
      It first proved its efficacy as an immunosuppressive regimen after renal
      transplantation, and was recently approved by the FDA for rheumatoid arthritis.
      First data in IBD are promising, especially in ulcerative colitis. Ongoing
      clinical trials in both UC and Crohn's disease (CD) are needed to further explore
      its efficacy in CD and to better assess its safety profile.

      colonization.
PG  - 366-72
LID - 10.4161/viru.24642 [doi]
AB  - Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) cause hemorrhagic colitis (HC) and 
      hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in humans. Outbreaks are linked to bovine food
      sources. STEC O157:H7 has been responsible for the most severe outbreaks
      worldwide. However, non-O157 serotypes have emerged as important enteric
      pathogens in several countries. The main virulence factor of STEC is the
      production of Shiga toxins 1 and 2. Additional virulence markers are a
      plasmid-encoded enterohemolysin (ehxA), an autoagglutinating adhesin (Saa), a
      catalase-peroxidase (katP), an extracellular serine protease (espP), a zinc
      metalloprotease (stcE), a subtilase cytotoxin (subAB), among others. Other
      virulence factors are intimin and adhesins that had a roll in the adherence of
      STEC to bovine colon. This review focuses on the virulence traits of STEC and
      especially on those related to the adhesion to bovine colon. The known of the
      interaction between STEC and the bovine host is crucial to develop strategies to 
      control cattle colonization.

TI  - Leukocyte traffic blockade as a therapeutic strategy in inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 1490-500
AB  - Dysregulated recruitment of leukocytes into the intestine is a characteristic
      feature of IBD. Several families of molecules regulate the influx of these cells 
      into sites of inflammation within the gastrointestinal tract. Pharmacological
      blockade of interactions between molecules that mediate the formation of stable
      bonds (integrins) and their endothelial ligands has already shown clinical
      efficacy. Antibodies that target participant molecules have been approved by the 
      US Federal Drug Administration for use in Crohn's, multiple sclerosis (MS) (i.e. 
      natalizumab) and psoriasis (i.e. efalizumab). A more recent additional family of 
      drugs, which might also interfere with lymphocyte traffic (i.e. sphingosine-1-
      phosphate receptor agonists: fingolimod) is in clinical use for MS and just
      recently entered the clinical trial stage for ulcerative colitis. In the present 
      review we discuss basic aspects of clinically relevant molecules and compile the 
      clinical studies that support the targeting of specific steps of the leukocyte
      adhesion cascade for therapeutic purposes in IBD.

TI  - ACG clinical guidelines: diagnosis and management of celiac disease.
PG  - 656-76; quiz 677
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2013.79 [doi]
AB  - This guideline presents recommendations for the diagnosis and management of
      patients with celiac disease. Celiac disease is an immune-based reaction to
      dietary gluten (storage protein for wheat, barley, and rye) that primarily
      affects the small intestine in those with a genetic predisposition and resolves
      with exclusion of gluten from the diet. There has been a substantial increase in 
      the prevalence of celiac disease over the last 50 years and an increase in the
      rate of diagnosis in the last 10 years. Celiac disease can present with many
      symptoms, including typical gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., diarrhea,
      steatorrhea, weight loss, bloating, flatulence, abdominal pain) and also
      non-gastrointestinal abnormalities (e.g., abnormal liver function tests, iron
      deficiency anemia, bone disease, skin disorders, and many other protean
      manifestations). Indeed, many individuals with celiac disease may have no
      symptoms at all. Celiac disease is usually detected by serologic testing of
      celiac-specific antibodies. The diagnosis is confirmed by duodenal mucosal
      biopsies. Both serology and biopsy should be performed on a gluten-containing
      diet. The treatment for celiac disease is primarily a gluten-free diet (GFD),
      which requires significant patient education, motivation, and follow-up.
      Non-responsive celiac disease occurs frequently, particularly in those diagnosed 
      in adulthood. Persistent or recurring symptoms should lead to a review of the
      patient's original diagnosis to exclude alternative diagnoses, a review of the
      GFD to ensure there is no obvious gluten contamination, and serologic testing to 
      confirm adherence with the GFD. In addition, evaluation for disorders associated 
      with celiac disease that could cause persistent symptoms, such as microscopic
      colitis, pancreatic exocrine dysfunction, and complications of celiac disease,
      such as enteropathy-associated lymphoma or refractory celiac disease, should be
      entertained. Newer therapeutic modalities are being studied in clinical trials,
      but are not yet approved for use in practice. Given the incomplete response of
      many patients to a GFD-free diet as well as the difficulty of adherence to the
      GFD over the long term, development of new effective therapies for symptom
      control and reversal of inflammation and organ damage are needed. The prevalence 
      of celiac disease is increasing worldwide and many patients with celiac disease
      remain undiagnosed, highlighting the need for improved strategies in the future
      for the optimal detection of patients.

TI  - [Efficacy of probiotics on ulcerative colitis and its mechanism].
PG  - 336-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of probiotics on the treatment outcomes of
      ulcerative colitis, and explore its possible mechanism. METHODS: According to the
      table of random number, 60 ulcerative colitis patients in our hospital were
      enrolled prospectively and divided into 3 groups: Golden Bifid group, Changmei
      group, combination group (Golden+ Changmei). Patients in Golden Bifid group
      received Golden Bifid 2.0 g, bid, those in Changmei group received Changmei 1.0
      g, tid, and those in combination group received the above two drugs for 24
      months. The clinical symptom score, colon mucosa inflammation score and
      endoscopic grade score were calculated and compared. IL-10 in mucosa and serum
      was determined by immunohistochemistry and double-antibody sandwich ELISA.
      RESULTS: In combined group after 24 months of treatment, clinical symptom score
      (12.5+/-2.1 vs. 2.3+/-0.8, P=0.016), endoscopic classification score (3.02+/-0.17
      vs. 0.25+/-0.13, P=0.032), inflammatory reaction score (2.63+/-0.19 vs.
      0.77+/-0.16, P=0.028) were significantly higher than those before treatment.
      While the scores differences of before and after treatment in Gold Bifid group
      and Changmei group were not statistically significant (P>0.05). IL-10 in serum
      [(17.4+/-2.2) ng/L vs. (12.8+/-2.2) ng/L, P=0.015] and colon mucosa [85% (17/20) 
      vs. 55% (11/20), P=0.026] in combination group were significantly higher than
      those before treatment. The differences in IL-10 expression level before and
      after treatment were not statistically significant in the Gold Bifid group and
      Changmei group (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Golden Bifid combined with Changmei as
      microbial ecological agents has a positive efficacy on mild to moderate
      ulcerative colitis, which may be associated with the up-regulation of IL-10
      expression.

TI  - Fasting serum concentration of short-chain fatty acids in subjects with
      microscopic colitis and celiac disease: no difference compared with controls, but
      between genders.
PG  - 696-701
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2013.786128 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), particularly propionic and butyric
      acids, have been shown to have many positive health effects. The amount and type 
      of SCFAs formed from dietary fibre by the colonic microbiota depends on the
      substrate available and is reflected in blood. The total intake and type of
      dietary fibre in people with gastrointestinal diseases differs considerably from 
      healthy subjects. OBJECTIVE: To compare fasting SCFA concentrations in subjects
      with microscopic colitis (MC), celiac disease and controls without these
      diseases. SCFAs were also analysed over 6.5 h in young healthy subjects, who had 
      eaten a fibre-rich breakfast, to identify a possible peak concentration of SCFAs 
      after a meal. METHODS: SCFAs in serum were pre-concentrated using hollow
      fibre-supported liquid membrane extraction and gas chromatography. RESULTS: The
      MC group had a higher concentration of valeric acid than the control group (p <
      0.01). No significant differences in other SCFA concentrations were seen between 
      groups, but the control group tended to have higher concentration of acetic acid 
      (p = 0.1). Furthermore, males had higher concentrations of SCFAs (with the
      exception of valeric acid) than females (p < 0.05), which were independent of
      groups. The peaks for acetic, propionic and butyric acids came approximately 5 h,
      6.5 h and 2-3 h, respectively, after breakfast. CONCLUSION: The fasting
      concentrations of SCFAs were quite similar, although the fibre intake had
      probably been quite different for a long time. The results might have been
      different if SCFAs had been recorded over a longer period.

TI  - Ischaemic colitis in rheumatoid arthritis patients receiving tumour necrosis
      factor-alpha inhibitors: an analysis of reports to the US FDA Adverse Event
      Reporting System.
PG  - 329-34
LID - 10.1007/s40264-013-0041-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors are
      immunosuppressants, approved for the treatment and maintenance of rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA). Immunosuppression has been shown to induce ischaemic colitis (IC)
      in an animal model; however, a relationship between TNF inhibitors and IC has
      rarely been reported in the published literature. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this
      study was to better characterize the association between TNF-alpha inhibitors
      with IC in RA patients, by analysing adverse event reports submitted to the US
      FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) and the published literature. METHODS: 
      The FDA AERS database was searched and we identified all reports between January 
      2003 and June 2011. The search was limited to an indication of RA, a 'primary
      suspect' drug of TNF-alpha inhibitors and a reaction of IC. Full-length reports
      were obtained and analysed utilizing the Freedom of Information Act. The cases
      were organized by age, sex, type of TNF-alpha inhibitor, concomitant drugs and
      medical co-morbidities. Cases were labelled as definite, probable, possible or
      doubtful drug-induced adverse events based on the Naranjo Scale. A PubMed search 
      was performed to obtain published literature documenting events of
      anti-TNF-associated IC. RESULTS: Twelve cases were eliminated because of more
      likely causes for IC. Thirty-five primary suspect reports of TNF-alpha inhibitors
      associated with IC in RA patients were identified in the FDA AERS. Thirteen cases
      were reported with infliximab, 12 with adalimumab, 7 with etanercept and 3 with
      certolizumab. The majority of the cases were in females (29/35) and those between
      the ages of 50 and 65 years (18/35). Use of the Naranjo Scale revealed 17
      probable and 18 possible cases of anti-TNF-induced IC. In the literature, one
      report of IC associated with adalimumab was identified. CONCLUSION: TNF-alpha
      inhibitors may be initiating factors or co-factors in the development of IC in RA
      patients, and further research to determine the mechanism of this association is 
      warranted.

TI  - The human gut microbiome: a review of the effect of obesity and surgically
      induced weight loss.
PG  - 563-9
LID - 10.1001/jamasurg.2013.5 [doi]
AB  - Recent advances in parallel genomic processing and computational mapping have
      been applied to the native human microbial environment to provide a new
      understanding of the role of the microbiome in health and disease. In particular,
      studies of the distal gut microbiome have proposed that changes in gut microbiota
      are related to obesity, the metabolic syndrome, and Western diet. We examined the
      changes in the distal gut microbiome composition as it relates to the lean and
      obese phenotypes, particularly after surgical weight loss. A PubMed search of
      publications from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2012, used the search
      terms weight, obesity, microbiome, and bariatric surgery. We included studies
      that provided information on subjects' weight and/or body mass index and a formal
      assessment of the microbiome. Certain bacteria, specifically the archaeon
      Methanobrevibacter smithii, have enhanced ability to metabolize dietary
      substrate, thereby increasing host energy intake and weight gain. With weight
      loss, there is a decrease in the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes phyla. One 
      major finding from microbial sequencing analyses after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass
      is the comparative overabundance of Proteobacteria in the distal gut microbiome, 
      which is distinct from the changes seen in weight loss without Roux-en-Y gastric 
      bypass. This review provides the practicing surgeon with (1) an update on the
      state of a rapidly innovating branch of clinical bioinformatics, specifically,
      the microbiome; (2) a new understanding of the microbiome changes after Roux-en-Y
      gastric bypass and weight loss; and (3) a basis for understanding further
      clinical applications of studies of the distal gut microbiome, such as in Crohn
      disease, ulcerative colitis, and infectious colitis.

TI  - Nutritional intake according to injury extent in ulcerative colitis patients.
PG  - 445-51
LID - 10.1111/jhn.12064 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is often associated with nutritional
      deficiency, which appears to contribute to the progression of UC severity. The
      present study aimed to evaluate nutritional status and dietary intake in UC
      remission patients. METHODS: The present study comprised a cross-sectional study 
      in which variables such as extent of disease (distal colitis, left-sided colitis,
      pancolitis), remission period, sex and age were recorded. Extent of disease was
      assessed by the results of a colonoscopy and dietary intake was evaluated by
      using 3-day, 24-h recalls. A Kruskall-Wallis test was used to compare the intake 
      of macro- and micronutrients among the three study groups. The analysis was
      complemented by the Mann-Whitney test. A logistic regression analysis was
      performed to identify predictive factors of extent of disease (pancolitis versus 
      left-sided colitis versus distal colitis). RESULTS: The median (range) age of the
      59 patients was 49.0 (37.0-63.0) years and 53.3% were female. Twenty-six (44.1%) 
      patients had distal colitis, 11 (18.6%) patients had left-sided colitis and 22
      (37.3%) patients had pancolitis. A high probability of an inadequate intake of
      fibre (100%), fat soluble vitamins (>40% for vitamin A and >95% for vitamin E),
      vitamin C (>34%), calcium (>90%) and magnesium (>50%) was identified in the study
      group. Vitamin D intake (odds ratio = 0.60; 95% confidence interval = 0.39-0.94; 
      P < 0.05) was significantly associated with increased intestinal damage.
      CONCLUSIONS: A large number of individuals showed an inadequate intake of
      nutrients. In addition, the consumption of vitamin D was significantly associated
      with extent of disease.

AB  - AIM: To evaluate potential risk factors in the development of ulcerative colitis 
      (UC) in China. METHODS: A total of 1308 patients with UC and 1308 age-matched and
      sex-matched controls were prospectively studied in China. The UC cases were
      collected from 17 hospitals in China from April 2007 to April 2010. Uniform
      questionnaires were designed to investigate risk factors including smoking,
      appendectomy, stress, socio-economic conditions, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs (NSAIDs), oral contraceptives, diet, breastfeeding, infections and family
      sanitary conditions. Group comparisons by each factor were done using simple
      logistic regression analysis. Conditional logistic regression was used for
      multivariate analysis. RESULTS: By univariate analysis, the variables predictive 
      of UC included feeling stress, light and heavy alcoholic drinking, spicy food,
      sugar consumption and infectious diarrhea, while heavy tea intake and tap water
      consumption were protective against UC. On multivariate analysis, the protective 
      factor for UC was tap water consumption [odds ratios (OR) = 0.424, 95%CI:
      0.302-0.594, P < 0.001]; while the potential risk factors for UC were heavy sugar
      consumption (OR = 1.632, 95%CI: 1.156-2.305, P < 0.001), spicy food (light
      intake: OR = 3.329, 95%CI: 2.282-4.857, P < 0.001; heavy intake: OR = 3.979,
      95%CI: 2.700-5.863, P < 0.001), and often feeling stress (OR = 1.981, 95%CI:
      1.447-2.711, P < 0.001). Other factors, such as smoking habit, appendectomy,
      breastfeeding, a history of measles, rural or urban residence, education, oral
      contraceptives, and NSAID use have not been found to have a significant
      association with the development of UC in the present study. CONCLUSION: Our
      study showed tap water consumption was a protective factor for UC, while spicy
      food, heavy sugar consumption and often feeling stress were risk factors for UC
      in this Chinese population.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a debilitating and widespread immune-mediated
      illness characterized by excessive inflammatory and effector mucosal responses
      leading to tissue destruction at the gastrointestinal tract. Interactions among
      the immune system, the commensal microbiota and the host genotype are thought to 
      underlie the pathogenesis of IBD. However, the precise etiology of IBD remains
      unknown. Diet-induced changes in the composition of the gut microbiome can
      modulate the induction of regulatory versus effector immune responses at the gut 
      mucosa and improve health outcomes. Therefore, manipulation of gut microbiota
      composition and the local production of microbial-derived metabolites by using
      prebiotics, probiotics and dietary fibers is being explored as a promising avenue
      of prophylactic and therapeutic intervention against gut inflammation. Prebiotics
      and fiber carbohydrates are fermented by resident microflora into short chain
      fatty acids (SCFAs) in the colon. SCFAs then activate peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma, a nuclear transcription factor with 
      widely demonstrated anti-inflammatory efficacy in experimental IBD. The
      activation of PPARgamma by naturally ocurring compounds such as conjugated
      linoleic acid, pomegranate seed oil-derived punicic acid, eleostearic acid and
      abscisic acid has been explored as nutritional interventions that suppress
      colitis by directly modulating the host immune response. The aim of this review
      is to summarize the status of innovative nutritional interventions against
      gastrointestinal inflammation, their proposed mechanisms of action, preclinical
      and clinical efficacy as well as bioinformatics and computational modeling
      approaches that accelerate discovery in nutritional and mucosal immunology
      research.

TI  - Ischemic colitis with type I interferons used in the treatment of hepatitis C and
      multiple sclerosis: an evaluation from the food and drug administration adverse
      event reporting system and review of the literature.
PG  - 537-42
LID - 10.1345/aph.1R526 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To better characterize the association between type I interferons and 
      ischemic colitis (IC) in patients with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and multiple
      sclerosis (MS), by analyzing reports submitted to the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) and the published
      literature. DATA SOURCES: A total of 2,562,390 reports of adverse events between 
      January 2003 and June 2011 were downloaded from the FDA AERS. A literature review
      was performed on PubMed (January 1966-August 2012) using the MeSH terms
      interferon or interferon alfa or interferon beta and ischemic colitis separated
      by the Boolean operator "and" between the first 3 terms and the last term.
      Additional literature was identified by conducting a hand search of the reference
      list of the published literature identified in the initial search. STUDY
      SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Cases were restricted to those with an indication 
      of HCV or MS, a primary suspect drug of a type I interferon, and a reaction of
      IC. Full-length reports were requested and organized by type of interferon, age, 
      sex, concomitant drugs, and comorbidities. The Naranjo probability scale was used
      to define cases as definite, probable, possible, or doubtful drug-induced adverse
      events. DATA SYNTHESIS: Type I interferons, including interferon alfa (IFN-alpha)
      and interferon beta (IFN-beta), are approved for the treatment of HCV and MS.
      IFN-alpha has been shown to induce IC, but a relationship between type I
      interferons and IC has not been clarified in the medical literature. Fifty-six
      primary suspect reports of type I interferons associated with IC in patients with
      HCV or MS were identified from the FDA AERS. Seventeen cases were reported with
      IFN-alpha and 39 cases were reported with IFN-beta. The majority of the cases
      were in females (80%) and those between the ages of 50 and 65 years (52%). The
      Naranjo probability scale identified 13 probable and 4 possible cases of
      IFN-alpha-induced IC, and 19 probable and 20 possible cases of IFN-beta-induced
      IC. In the literature, 11 cases of IFN-alpha-induced IC were reported, while
      there were no reports with IFN-beta. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests a possible
      association between treatment with type I interferons and the development of IC. 
      Further research to determine the mechanism of this association is warranted.

TI  - Alterations in mucosal neuropeptides in patients with irritable bowel syndrome
      and ulcerative colitis in remission: a role in pain symptom generation?
PG  - 1299-306
LID - 10.1002/j.1532-2149.2013.00309.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal
      disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain. The transient receptor
      potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel, which is involved in visceral pain
      signalling, has been shown to be up-regulated in IBS. Activation of TRPV1 leads
      to the release of neuropeptides, such as somatostatin and substance P (SP). We
      hypothesized that increased pain perception in IBS could be explained by
      increased transcription in TRPV1 and/or altered levels of neuropeptides. We
      therefore assessed the transcription of TRPV1 and the mucosal concentration of
      somatostatin and SP in IBS in comparison to healthy volunteers and patients with 
      ulcerative colitis (UC) in remission as disease controls, and to ascertain their 
      relationship to pain symptoms. METHOD: Sigmoid colonic mucosal samples were
      collected from 12 patients with IBS, 34 patients with UC in remission and 9
      healthy volunteers, in which groups TRPV1 mRNA levels were determined using
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction and neuropeptide concentrations by
      radioimmunoassay. Pain symptom intensity was determined by questionnaires.
      RESULTS: Transcription of TRPV1 as well as the concentration of neuropeptides
      were significantly higher in IBS, but only the former correlated with pain
      symptom severity. CONCLUSION: Increased transcription of TRPV1 may provide a
      possible explanation for pain generation in IBS. While the neuropeptides SP and
      somatostatin were both found to be increased in IBS, these changes are not
      sufficient to explain pain generation. Pain generation in IBS is probably
      explained by a complex redundancy in the regulation of local nociceptive
      mechanisms, which remains a subject of intensive investigation.

LID - 10.1099/jmm.0.056556-0 [doi]
AB  - Clostridium difficile is a frequent cause of severe, recurrent post-antibiotic
      diarrhoea and pseudomembranous colitis. The surface layer (S-layer) is the
      predominant outer surface component of C. difficile which is involved in
      pathogen-host interactions critical to pathogenesis. In this study, we
      characterized the S-layer protein A (SlpA) of animal and human strains belonging 
      to different PCR-ribotypes (PR) and compared the in vitro adherence and in vivo
      colonization properties of strains showing different SlpA variants. Since each
      SlpA variant has been recently associated with an S-layer cassette, we were able 
      to deduce the cassette for each of our strains. In this study, an identity of
      99-100 % was found among the SlpA of isolates belonging to PR 012, 014/020, 045
      and 078. One exception was the SlpA of a poultry isolate, PR 014/020, which
      showed 99 % identity with that of strain 0160, another PR 014/020 which contains 
      an S-layer cassette 6. Interestingly, this cassette has also been found in a PR
      018 strain, an emerging virulent type currently predominant in Italy. Five other 
      SlpA variants (v014/020a-e) were identified in strains PR 014/020. In vitro
      adherence assays and in vivo colonization experiments were performed on five PR
      014/020 strains: human 1064 (v014/020e), human 4684/08 (v014/020b), human IT1106 
      (v078a), poultry P30 (v014/020d) and poultry PB90 (v014/020b) strains. Adhesion
      assays indicate that C. difficile strains vary in their capacity to adhere to
      cells in culture and that adhesion seems to be independent of the SlpA variant.
      Colonization properties were assessed in vivo using a dixenic mouse model of
      colonization. The kinetics of faecal shedding and caecal colonization were
      similar when human 4684/08 (v014/020b) strain was compared with human 1064
      (v014/020e) and poultry PB90 (v014/020b) strain. In contrast, poultry P30
      (v014/020d) strain outcompeted both human 4684/08 (v014/020b) and IT1106 (v078a) 
      strains and its adherence to caeca at day 7 was significantly higher. The
      peculiar characteristics of C. difficile P30 seem to advantage it in colonizing
      the intestinal mice niche, increasing its ability to compete and adapt. The
      results obtained underline the need of an increased attention to the genetic
      evolution of C. difficile to prevent and limit the consequences of the emergence 
      of increasingly virulent strains.

AB  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 is a well-known pathogen as a cause of
      diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis (HC), and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been widely used to determine genetic
      relatedness and epidemiological relationship of O157:H7. Little is known of
      genetic diversity of Chinese O157:H7 isolates and their relationships with global
      isolates. The minimum sets of 32 SNPs each from Manning et al. and Clawson et al.
      were used to type 325 Chinese O157:H7 isolates. The 64 SNPs divided the Chinese
      O157:H7 isolates into 5 SNP genotypes (SG-1-SG-5). The most common SGs were SG-5 
      (79.69%) and SG-1 (14.46%). Human isolates concentrated in SG-1 and SG-5, and
      there is only 1 human isolates in SG-3. The 47 isolates in SG-1 were further
      divided by an additional SNP sourced from Xuzhou21 genome into 2 subtypes (SG-1.1
      and SG-1.2). Strains in SG-1.1 caused the 1999 Xuzhou deadly outbreak. Our
      Chinese isolates have been found to belong to a limited number of SNP genotypes
      and are represented by distantly related clades in Manning et al. and lineages in
      Claswon et al., suggesting parallel spread of these SNP genotypes in China.

LID - 10.1155/2013/142492 [doi]
AB  - Innate immunity prevents pathogens from entering and spreading within the body.
      This function is especially important in the gastrointestinal tract and skin, as 
      these organs have a large surface contact area with the outside environment. In
      the intestine, luminal commensal bacteria are necessary for adequate food
      digestion and play a crucial role in tolerance to benign antigens. Immune system 
      damage can create an intestinal inflammatory response, leading to chronic disease
      including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an IBD of
      unknown etiology with increasing worldwide prevalence. In the intestinal mucosa
      of UC patients, there is an imbalance in the IL-33/ST2 axis, an important
      modulator of the innate immune response. This paper reviews the role of the
      IL-33/ST2 system in innate immunity of the intestinal mucosa and its importance
      in inflammatory bowel diseases, especially ulcerative colitis.

PG  - 787-96
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2012-302504 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics are derived from traditional fermented foods, from beneficial
      commensals or from the environment. They act through diverse mechanisms affecting
      the composition or function of the commensal microbiota and by altering host
      epithelial and immunological responses. Certain probiotic interventions have
      shown promise in selected clinical conditions where aberrant microbiota have been
      reported, such as atopic dermatitis, necrotising enterocolitis, pouchitis and
      possibly irritable bowel syndrome. However, no studies have been conducted that
      can causally link clinical improvements to probiotic-induced microbiota changes. 
      Whether a disease-prone microbiota pattern can be remodelled to a more robust,
      resilient and disease-free state by probiotic administration remains a key
      unanswered question. Progress in this area will be facilitated by: optimising
      strain, dose and product formulations, including protective commensal species;
      matching these formulations with selectively responsive subpopulations; and
      identifying ways to manipulate diet to modify bacterial profiles and metabolism.

TI  - Fecal transplant in refractory Clostridium difficile colitis.
PG  - 108-15
LID - 10.3238/arztebl.2013.0108 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile infections are becoming more common, more
      severe, and more likely to recur. Conventional treatment with antibiotics often
      fails to eradicate the infection; even when it succeeds, recurrent infection is
      common. Complementary treatment with probiotic agents to reconstitute the
      physiological intestinal flora does not yield any consistent benefit. In recent
      years, fecal transplantation has been used in the English-speaking countries with
      cure rates of about 87%, but the available evidence is limited to large case
      series. No randomized controlled trials have been performed. We present the case 
      of a 73-year-old woman with intractable, recurrent enterocolitis due to
      Clostridium difficile who was successfully treated with fecal transplantation via
      colonoscopy. CASE DESCRIPTION: Upon the completion of antibiotic treatment for a 
      second recurrence of enterocolitis, stool in liquid suspension was introduced
      into the patient's colon through a colonoscope. Prior testing had shown the stool
      donor to be free of acute infection or stool pathogens. The patient was given
      loperamide to prolong contact of the stool transplant with the colonic mucosa.
      She was also treated with Saccharomyces cerevisiae for four weeks. COURSE: There 
      was no clinical or microbiological evidence of a further recurrence of
      enterocolitis for 6 months after transplantation. Stool transplantation had no
      adverse effects. CONCLUSION: This patient had a lasting remission of
      enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile after the treatment described above.
      Fecal transplantation seems to be a safe and highly effective treatment for
      recurrent Clostridium difficile infection. It is unclear whether the
      administration of Saccharomyces cerevisiae confers any additional benefit.

TI  - Lactobacillus GG-fermented milk prevents DSS-induced colitis and regulates
      intestinal epithelial homeostasis through activation of epidermal growth factor
      receptor.
PG  - 105-15
LID - 10.1007/s00394-013-0506-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fermented milk is considered one of the best sources for efficient
      consumption of probiotic strains by hosts to promote good health. The purpose of 
      this study was to investigate the effects of orally administering LGG-fermented
      milk (LGG milk) on intestinal inflammation and injury and to study the mechanisms
      of LGG milk's action. METHODS: LGG milk and non-LGG-fermented milk (non-LGG milk)
      were administered through gavage to mice before and during dextran sodium sulfate
      (DSS)-induced intestinal injury and colitis. Inflammatory/injury score and colon 
      length were assessed. Intestinal epithelial cells were treated with the soluble
      fraction of LGG milk to detect its effects on the epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR) and its downstream target, Akt activation, cytokine-induced
      apoptosis, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced disruption of tight junctions.
      RESULTS: LGG milk treatment significantly reduced DSS-induced colonic
      inflammation and injury, and colon shortening in mice, compared to that in
      non-LGG milk-treated and -untreated mice. The soluble fraction of LGG milk, but
      not non-LGG milk, stimulated the activation of EGFR and Akt in a
      concentration-dependent manner, suppressed cytokine-induced apoptosis, and
      attenuated H2O2-induced disruption of tight junction complex in the intestinal
      epithelial cells. These effects of LGG milk were blocked by the EGFR kinase
      inhibitor. LGG milk, but not non-LGG milk, contained two soluble proteins, p40
      and p75, that have been reported to promote survival and growth of intestinal
      epithelial cells through the activation of EGFR. Depletion of p40 and p75 from
      LGG milk abolished the effects of LGG milk on prevention of cytokine-induced
      apoptosis and H2O2-induced disruption of tight junctions. CONCLUSIONS: These
      results suggest that LGG milk may regulate intestinal epithelial homeostasis and 
      potentially prevent intestinal inflammatory diseases through activation of EGFR
      by LGG-derived proteins.

AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammation-associated disease of the colon and
      rectum. The onset and progress of the disease are directly influenced by the
      nature of the intestinal microflora, the intestinal barrier function, and the
      immunological responses of the host. The epithelial invasion of pathogenic
      bacteria due to excess contact and/or barrier dysfunction is related to
      inflammation mediated by intestinal immune responses. Although the etiology of UC
      is not clearly understood, recent studies have shown a rising incidence of UC
      worldwide, and this phenomenon is more prominent in Asian countries and in Asian 
      immigrants in Western countries. The increased prevalence of UC also contributes 
      to an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer. Environmental factors,
      including changes in dietary habits, have been suggested as major risk factors of
      UC. A systematic review showed a negative association between UC risk and
      vegetable intake, whereas total fat, omega-6 fatty acids and meat intake were
      positively associated with an increased risk of UC. Individual dietary factors
      and energy balance have been suggested as having important roles in inducing
      changes in the microbial population and intestinal barrier integrity and in
      regulating inflammatory immune responses, directly or indirectly. Excess energy
      intake is now known to increase pathogenic microbial populations. Likewise, the
      application of appropriate probiotics may reverse the pathogenic progression of
      the disease. In the meantime, dietary anti-inflammatory compounds, including
      omega-3 fatty acids and other phytochemicals, may directly suppress inflammatory 
      responses in the course of UC development. In this review, the increased
      prevalence of UC and its management are interpreted from the standpoint of
      nutritional modulation to regulate the intestinal microflora population,
      intestinal epithelium permeability, and inflammatory responses.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Allergic colitis (AC) is an inflammatory condition characterized by
      eosinophils infiltrating the colonic wall. It can be a benign and/or severe
      illness among gastrointestinal diseases in infants. METHODS: We report five
      infants who, since January 2009, in whom AC under fibrotic endoscopic
      examinations has been diagnosed. The criterion for histopathologic diagnosis of
      AC in this study was five or more eosinophils per high-power field. Patients'
      clinical symptoms, pathologic findings, and immunologic studies, such as specific
      antibodies against component of cow's milk protein, were compared with those of
      allergic children without AC and those of nonatopic control children. RESULTS:
      Histopathologic examinations of biopsy specimens revealed acute inflammation with
      characteristic eosinophilic infiltration of lamina propria (5-15 eosinophils per 
      high-power field) in all five patients. They all had strongly positive skin prick
      tests against milk protein, which were not correlated with in vitro
      allergen-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) E levels. In contrast, there were
      significantly higher levels of IgE antibodies, and lower specific IgG4 and IgA
      levels to components and whole milk proteins in AC, as compared to control
      children without AC. CONCLUSION: Endoscopic biopsy specimens of intestine confirm
      the diagnosis of AC. However, allergen skin prick test and IgE antibody to milk
      protein components also provide helpful diagnostic tools for this rare disease in
      children.

TI  - Does cow's milk protein elimination diet have a role on induction and maintenance
      of remission in children with ulcerative colitis?
PG  - e273-8
LID - 10.1111/apa.12215 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Aims of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of a cow's milk protein
      (CMP) elimination diet on induction and maintenance of remission and to define
      association with atopy in children with ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS:
      Twenty-nine consecutive patients (mean age: 11.2 years; range: 4.6-17 years; F/M:
      15/14) with newly diagnosed UC were randomized either to receive a CMP
      elimination diet (n = 14) or to continue a free diet (n = 15) associated with
      concomitant steroid induction and mesalazine maintenance treatment. Children were
      prospectively evaluated at four time points: within 1 month, 6 months and 1 year 
      after diagnosis or at the time of relapse. RESULTS: Twenty-five of the 29
      enrolled patients responded to the UC induction therapy with a complete remission
      (86.2%), 13 belonging to CMP elimination diet group and 12 to free diet group (p 
      = 0.59). Overall, our data showed that 7 of 13 (53.8%) patients treated with CMP 
      elimination diet and 8 of 15 (53.3%) patients on free diet and UC therapy
      relapsed within 1 year of follow-up (p = 1). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, data of 
      this paediatric, randomized trial suggest that CMP elimination has no role in the
      management of UC in non-sensitized children.

LID - 10.3920/BM2012.0038 [doi]
AB  - Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 and adherent-invasive Escherichia
      coli are two groups of enteric bacterial pathogens associated with haemorrhagic
      colitis and Crohn's Disease, respectively. Bacterial contact with host epithelial
      cells stimulates an immediate innate immune response designed to combat
      infection. In this study, immune responses of human epithelial cells to
      pathogens, either alone or in combination with probiotic bacteria were studied.
      Industrially prepared Lactobacillus helveticus strain R0052 was first examined by
      microarray analysis and then compared to broth-grown strains of R0052 and
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG using quantitative realt-time polymerase chain 
      reaction. Results showed host immune activation responses increased following
      pathogen exposure, which were differentially ameliorated using probiotics
      depending on both the preparation of probiotics employed and conditions of
      exposure. These findings provide additional support for the concept that specific
      probiotic strains serve as a promising option for use in preventing the risk of
      enteric bacterial infections.

TI  - Cellulose supplementation early in life ameliorates colitis in adult mice.
PG  - e56685
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0056685 [doi]
AB  - Decreased consumption of dietary fibers, such as cellulose, has been proposed to 
      promote the emergence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD: Crohn disease [CD] and
      ulcerative colitis [UC]) where intestinal microbes are recognized to play an
      etiologic role. However, it is not known if transient fiber consumption during
      critical developmental periods may prevent consecutive intestinal inflammation.
      The incidence of IBD peaks in young adulthood indicating that pediatric
      environmental exposures may be important in the etiology of this disease group.
      We studied the effects of transient dietary cellulose supplementation on dextran 
      sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis susceptibility during the pediatric period in mice. 
      Cellulose supplementation stimulated substantial shifts in the colonic mucosal
      microbiome. Several bacterial taxa decreased in relative abundance (e.g.,
      Coriobacteriaceae [p = 0.001]), and other taxa increased in abundance (e.g.,
      Peptostreptococcaceae [p = 0.008] and Clostridiaceae [p = 0.048]). Some of these 
      shifts persisted for 10 days following the cessation of cellulose
      supplementation. The changes in the gut microbiome were associated with transient
      trophic and anticolitic effects 10 days following the cessation of a
      cellulose-enriched diet, but these changes diminished by 40 days following
      reversal to a low cellulose diet. These findings emphasize the transient
      protective effect of dietary cellulose in the mammalian large bowel and highlight
      the potential role of dietary fibers in amelioration of intestinal inflammation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2007, leading international experts in the field of inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) recommended intravenous (IV) iron supplements over oral (PO) 
      ones because of superior effectiveness and better tolerance. We aimed to
      determine the percentage of patients with IBD undergoing iron therapy and to
      assess the dynamics of iron prescription habits (IV versus PO). METHODS: We
      analyzed anonymized data on patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis 
      extracted from the Helsana database. Helsana is a Swiss health insurance company 
      providing coverage for 18% of the Swiss population (1.2 million individuals).
      RESULTS: In total, 629 patients with Crohn's disease (61% female) and 398
      patients with ulcerative colitis (57% female) were identified; mean observation
      time was 31.8 months for Crohn's disease and 31.0 months for ulcerative colitis
      patients. Of all patients with IBD, 27.1% were prescribed iron (21.1% in males;
      31.1% in females). Patients treated with steroids, immunomodulators, and/or
      anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs were more frequently treated with iron
      supplements when compared with those not treated with any medications (35.0%
      versus 20.9%, odds ratio, 1.94; P < 0.001). The frequency of IV iron
      prescriptions increased significantly from 2006 to 2009 for both genders (males: 
      from 2.6% to 10.1%, odds ratio = 3.84, P < 0.001; females: from 5.3% to 12.1%,
      odds ratio = 2.26, P = 0.002), whereas the percentage of PO iron prescriptions
      did not change. CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-seven percent of patients with IBD were
      treated with iron supplements. Iron supplements administered IV were prescribed
      more frequently over time. These prescription habits are consistent with the
      implementation of guidelines on the management of iron deficiency in IBD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in the
      general population and in patients with chronic diseases has increased markedly
      in recent decades. We aimed to determine the prevalence, type, and predictors of 
      oral CAM use among patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) compared with
      the general population in a large, population-based, case-control study. METHODS:
      Overall, 1370 patients with IBD and 598 control subjects in Canterbury, New
      Zealand, were recruited. Environmental and phenotypic data were obtained through 
      a questionnaire and case note review. Predictors of oral CAM use were identified 
      using binary logistic regression. RESULTS: In the previous year, 44.1% of
      patients with IBD and 42.3% of control subjects used oral CAM (odds ratio [OR],
      1.078; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.885-1.312). The types of oral CAM used
      most frequently were vitamins (Crohn's disease [CD], 25.2%; ulcerative colitis,
      23.7%; control subjects, 24.9%), followed by herbs (CD 15.1%, ulcerative colitis 
      15.2%, control subjects 12.8%), and dietary supplements (CD, 8.5%; ulcerative
      colitis 12.6%, control subjects 12.1%). Female gender (OR, 1.61; 95% CI,
      1.25-2.08), younger age (P = 0.005), higher education (P = 0.002), higher income 
      (P = 0.04), being a vegetarian (OR, 3.58; 95% CI, 1.97-6.48) and a middle social 
      class at birth (P = 0.024) were independent predictors of oral CAM use in
      patients with IBD. Disease phenotype was not associated with oral CAM use. In
      control subjects, female gender (OR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.85-3.86), higher education
      (P = 0.003) and a diagnosis of asthma (P = 0.017) predicted oral CAM use.
      CONCLUSIONS: Oral CAM use is common in, and does not differ between, patients
      with IBD and the general population in Canterbury, New Zealand. Socio-demographic
      factors, and not disease phenotype, predict oral CAM use in patients with IBD.

PG  - 437-9

AB  - Probiotic strains of Lactobacillus are currently used in a variety of clinical
      practices with limited evidence to support their use. Lactobacillus species are a
      normal part of gastrointestinal flora, and bacteremia with probiotic strains of
      Lactobacillus is very uncommon. We describe a case of Lactobacillus bacteremia in
      a 17-year-old boy with ulcerative colitis managed with systemic corticosteroids
      and infliximab, who presented with fever to 102 degrees F, flushing, and chills 1
      week after starting Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG probiotics. Initial blood culture 
      on day 2 of his fever was positive for Lactobacillus, however, subsequent blood
      cultures on day 3 and 5 were negative. He was treated empirically with
      antibiotics for 5 days and defervesced by day 8 of his illness. 16 S rRNA
      sequence analysis identified the organism from the patient's blood culture and
      probiotic capsule as L. rhamnosus with a 99.78% match for both the strains. This 
      case report highlights the potential risk of Lactobacillus bacteremia in
      immunosuppressed patients with severe active ulcerative colitis.

AB  - After a short overview of the history of probiotics, the author presents the
      development of human intestinal microflora based on the newest genetic data and
      the microbiological features of main probiotics. The indications of probiotic
      administration have been defined and extended in recent years. The author reviews
      significant results of probiotic treatment in some gastrointestinal diseases
      based on meta-analytical data. Probiotics are useful in preventing and treating
      diarrhoea caused by antibiotics and Clostridium difficile caused diarrhoea. In
      the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection, preparations containing certain
      Lactobacillus,Bifidobacterium strains or Saccaromyces boulardii could enhance by 
      5-10% the rate of successful eradication and reduce the incidence and severity of
      the side effects. Some symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and thus the quality 
      of life can be improved by probiotics. Their beneficial effect in ulcerative
      colitis was proven, while in Crohn's disease has not yet been defined. The use of
      probiotics is not included in guidelines, with the exception of the Maastricht
      IV/Florence consensus. For each disease it is advisable to use probiotics
      containing strains only with proven beneficial effect. The efficiency of
      preparations containing mixed strains has not yet been properly investigated. The
      author reviews the rare but potentially serious side effects of probiotics. In
      Hungary, there are many probiotic preparations available which can be purchased
      in pharmacies without prescription: their use is more empirical than
      evidence-based. The European Food Safety Authority has recently rejected claims
      for probiotics to be classed as medicines given the lack of convincing evidence
      on the effects of probiotics on human health and well-being. Clearly, further
      research is needed to collect evidence which could be incorporated into the
      international guidelines.

AB  - Individuals with ulcerative colitis face an increased risk of developing
      colorectal cancer and would benefit from early chemopreventive intervention.
      Results from preclinical studies in the mouse model of dextran sulfate
      sodium-induced colitis demonstrate that flat and polypoid colitis-associated
      dysplasias arise via distinct genetic pathways, impacted by the allelic status of
      p53. Furthermore, flat and polypoid dysplasias vary in their response to
      induction by the heterocyclic amine 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) 
      and inhibition by 5-aminosalicylic acid, a common therapy for the maintenance of 
      colitis patients. These data suggest that use of combination therapy is essential
      for the optimal inhibition of colitis-associated colorectal cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Crohn's disease prevalence increases with increasing
      latitude. Because most vitamin D comes from sunlight exposure and murine models
      of intestinal inflammation have demonstrated beneficial effects of 1,25-(OH)2
      vitamin D treatment, we hypothesised that Crohn's disease activity is associated 
      with low vitamin D levels. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study of 182 CD patients
      and 62 healthy controls, we measured serum 25-OH vitamin D. Stratified analysis
      was used to compare 25-OH vitamin D levels with Crohn's disease activity index,
      C-reactive protein, smoking status, intake of oral vitamin D supplements and
      seasonal variation in CD patients and healthy controls. RESULTS: Serum 25-OH
      vitamin D was inversely associated with disease activity: Median 25-OH vitamin D 
      levels of Crohn's disease in remission, mildly, and moderately active diseases
      evaluated by Crohn's disease activity index were 64, 49, and 21 nmol/l (p<0.01)
      and by CRP 68, 76, and 35 nmol/l (p<0.05), respectively. Patients who took oral
      vitamin D supplementation had lower Crohn's disease activity index (p<0.05) and
      C-reactive protein (p=0.07) than non-users. Crohn's disease patients who smoked
      had lower vitamin D levels (51 nmol/l) than patients who did not smoke (76
      nmol/l), p<0.01. Overall, Crohn's disease patients did not differ from healthy
      controls regarding 25-OH vitamin D levels. CONCLUSIONS: Active Crohn's disease
      was associated with low serum 25-OH vitamin D. Patients who smoked had lower
      25-OH vitamin D levels than patients who did not smoke, independently of disease 
      activity.

AB  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli cause approximately 1.5 million infections
      globally with 176,000 cases occurring in the United States annually from
      ingesting contaminated food, most frequently E. coli O157:H7 in ground beef or
      fresh produce. In severe cases, the painful prodromal hemorrhagic colitis is
      complicated by potentially lethal hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), particularly
      in children. Bacterial Shiga-like toxins (Stx1, Stx2) are primarily responsible
      for HUS and the kidney and neurologic damage that ensue. Small animal models are 
      hampered by the inability to reproduce HUS with thrombotic microangiopathy,
      hemolytic anemia, and acute kidney injury. Earlier, we showed that nonhuman
      primates (Papio) recapitulated clinical HUS after Stx challenge and that novel
      therapeutic intervention rescued the animals. Here, we present detailed light and
      electron microscopic pathology examination of the kidneys from these Stx studies.
      Stx1 challenge resulted in more severe glomerular endothelial injury, whereas the
      glomerular injury after Stx2 also included prominent mesangiolysis and an
      eosinophilic inflammatory infiltration. Both toxins induced glomerular
      platelet-rich thrombi, interstitial hemorrhage, and tubular injury. Analysis of
      kidney and other organs for inflammation biomarkers showed a striking chemotactic
      profile, with extremely high mRNA levels for IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant
      protein 1, and macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha and elevated urine
      chemokines at 48 hours after challenge. These observations give unique insight
      into the pathologic consequences of each toxin in a near human setting and
      present potential pathways for therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) incidence has increased over the past fifty years but the
      explanation is unclear. CD can be brought into remission by liquid enteral
      feeding, but the mechanism for this response is unknown. We suggest that
      consumption of emulsifiers in processed foods may promote CD by increasing
      bacterial translocation. This is supported by evidence that (i) geographical
      variation in CD correlates with emulsifier consumption as does the increasing
      incidence of CD in Japan; (ii) although CD incidence also correlates with fat
      consumption, the response to enteral feeding is not affected by the fat content
      of the feed and (iii) very small concentrations of the emulsifier polysorbate 80 
      enhance bacterial translocation across intestinal epithelia. Undigested
      emulsifiers may increase bacterial translocation, particularly in the small
      intestine where the mucus layer is discontinuous. The hypothesis should be
      testable by trials of enteral feeding with/without emulsifiers.

      LAB to colonize mucus.
PG  - 1110
LID - 10.1038/srep01110 [doi]
AB  - We compared fecal microbial communities derived either from Ulcerative Colitis
      (UC) patients in remission (n = 4) or in relapse (n = 4), or from healthy
      subjects (n = 4). These communities were used for inoculation of a dynamic in
      vitro gut model, which contained integrated mucin-covered microcosms. We found
      that the microbiota of the 'mucus' largely differed from that of the 'lumen'.
      This was partly due to decreased mucus-associated populations of lactic acid
      producing bacterial populations (LAB), as LAB originating from UC patients had a 
      significantly decreased capacity to colonize the mucin-covered microcosms as
      compared to those originating from healthy subjects. We found significant
      differences between the metabolomes of UC patients in relapse and remission,
      respectively, while the metabolome of patients in remission resembled that of
      healthy subjects. These novel findings constitute an important contribution to
      the understanding of the complex etiology of UC.

      derivatives and associated inflammatory activity (Review).
PG  - 793-802
LID - 10.3892/ijo.2013.1771 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin Ks (VKs) are fat-soluble quinone compounds known to have various
      bioactivities. This review describes the inflammatory effects of VKs and their
      related quinone derivatives based on DNA polymerase (pol) inhibition. VK3, but
      not VK1 or VK2 (=MK-4), inhibited the activity of human pol gamma, which is the
      DNA replicative pol in mitochondria. Of the intermediate compounds between VK2
      and VK3 (namely MK-3, MK-2 and MK-1), MK-2 was the strongest inhibitor of
      mammalian pols alpha, kappa and lambda, which belong to the B-, Y- and X-families
      of pols, respectively. Among the VK3 based quinone derivatives, such as
      1,4-naphthoquinone (NQ), 2-dimethyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (1,2-dimethyl-NQ),
      1,4-benzoquinone (BQ), 9,10-anthraquinone (AQ) and 5,12-naphthacenequinone (NCQ),
      NQ was the strongest inhibitor of mammalian pols alpha and lambda, in particular,
      DNA repair-related pol lambda. Among the all compounds tested, NQ displayed the
      strongest suppression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha production induced by 
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in a cell culture system using RAW264.7 mouse
      macrophages. NQ also suppressed the expression of pol lambda protein in these
      cells, after LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells were stimulated to induce pol lambda
      expression. In an in vivo mouse model of LPS-evoked acute inflammation,
      intraperitoneal injection of NQ into mice suppressed TNF-alpha production in
      peritoneal macrophages and serum. In an in vivo colitis mouse model induced using
      dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), NQ markedly suppressed DSS-evoked colitis. The
      promising anti-inflammatory candidates based on the inhibition of DNA
      repair-related pols, such as pol lambda, by VKs quinone derivatives, such as NQ, 
      are discussed.

      tailored therapies.
PG  - 172-4
LID - 10.4161/gmic.23589 [doi]
AB  - Evidence presented in our recent study and elsewhere suggests that the interplay 
      of dietary macronutrients with the intestinal lumen alters the microbial
      environment, and thus host-microbe interactions, in ways that are not always in a
      favorable, mutualistic fashion. Specifically, in inflammatory bowel diseases
      (IBD), experimental and clinical observations have implicated a detrimental
      impact of environmental/microbial factors on the etiopathogenesis of IBD in
      individuals with a background of genetic susceptibility to the disease. Thus, now
      more than ever, we are realizing that specific intestinal microbes can metabolize
      and react to a wide array of dietary compositions that, in turn, markedly alter
      microbial populations. We aimed to understand if certain dietary fats that are
      prevalent in Western diets are capable of precipitating colonic inflammation
      through their actions on the enteric microbiota. On a background of genetic
      susceptibility, these microbial changes can impact host immune homeostasis and
      increase risk for disease. Here we elaborate on our findings and their potential 
      implications for future medical care.

AB  - Since its first description in 1982, the zoonotic life-threatening Shiga
      toxin-producing Escherichia coli O157:H7 has emerged as an important food- and
      water-borne pathogen that causes diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, and
      hemolytic-uremic syndrome in humans. In the last decade, increases in E. coli
      O157:H7 outbreaks were associated with environmental contamination in water and
      through fresh produce such as green leaves or vegetables. Both intrinsic (genetic
      adaptation) and extrinsic factors may contribute and help E. coli O157:H7 to
      survive in adverse environments. This makes it even more difficult to detect and 
      monitor food and water safety for public health surveillance. E. coli O157:H7 has
      evolved in behaviors and strategies to persist in the environment.

LID - bcr2012007509 [pii]
AB  - A 25-year-old Iranian gentleman was admitted to hospital with severe bloody
      diarrhoea and abdominal pain. He had similar episodes in the past. On each
      occasion his symptoms developed following the consumption of the herbal weight
      loss supplement Hydroxycut Hardcore X. On this admission, a (CT) scan
      demonstrated bowel wall thickening and peri-colonic fat stranding in the sigmoid 
      colon. On flexible sigmoidoscopy, a continuous length of congested mucosa with
      multiple small ulcers was seen extending up to the mid-transverse colon, in
      keeping with ulcerative colitis. Histological analysis of biopsies was taken at
      the time and confirmed this. He was started on steroids early during his
      admission but this only provided a transient clinical improvement. The addition
      of cyclosporine, which was later changed to azathioprine, did not improve his
      condition either. He therefore underwent an open subtotal colectomy with end
      ileostomy. He made a slow but steady recovery and was discharged 3 weeks later.

TI  - Probiotics in the management of irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 184-9
LID - 10.1097/MOG.0b013e32835d7bba [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is direct evidence that the pathogenesis of inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) involves the gastrointestinal microbiota and some evidence
      that the microbiota might also play a similar role in irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS). The aim of this article is to review the emerging evidence for the
      mechanisms and effectiveness of probiotics in the management of these disorders. 
      RECENT FINDINGS: The composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota is strongly
      influenced by factors including age, diet and disease. Probiotics may be
      effective through their impact on the host gastrointestinal microbiota and
      promotion of mucosal immunoregulation. Probiotics are considered to be well
      tolerated, although the quality of studies and health claims has been variable.
      There are many short-term studies demonstrating the effectiveness of probiotics
      in IBS, although recommendations should be made for specific strains and for
      specific symptoms. Within IBD, a number of trials have shown the benefits of a
      range of probiotics in pouchitis and in ulcerative colitis, although current
      evidence in Crohn's disease is less promising. SUMMARY: Clearly, some probiotics 
      have considerable potential in the management of IBS and IBD; however, the
      benefits are strain specific. High-quality trials of probiotics in
      gastrointestinal disorders as well as laboratory investigations of their
      mechanism of action are required in order to understand who responds and why.

TI  - Strong correlation between diet and development of colorectal cancer.
PG  - 190-8
AB  - Multiple factors have been described among the causes of non-hereditary
      colorectal cancer. In Western countries, the most common risk factors include
      upper-middle socioeconomic status and dietary regimens rich in proteins and
      animal fats. High consumption of red meats, smoked foods, cold cuts, or canned
      foods is believed to contribute to carcinogenesis as they directly affect
      epithlial turnover and cause metabolism of biliary acids. Dietary fibers have
      protective effects in that they capture the fats and biliary acids, thereby
      inhibiting their activity. Tobacco smoking acts both locally and systemically on 
      the colorectal mucosa through the production of carcinogenic agents. Finally, the
      action of alcohol, in association with nicotine addiction, also increases the
      risk of developing colorectal tumors. Knowledge of dietary and environmental
      factors is of paramount importance in implementing preventive strategies for
      colorectal cancer.

PG  - 1745-52
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2012-303611 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Many species within the phylum Firmicutes are thought to exert
      anti-inflammatory effects. We quantified bacteria belonging to the genus
      Butyricicoccus in stools of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's
      disease (CD). We evaluated the effect of Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum in a rat
      colitis model and analysed the ability to prevent cytokine-induced increases in
      epithelial permeability. DESIGN: A genus-specific quantitative PCR was used for
      quantification of Butyricicoccus in stools from patients with UC or CD and
      healthy subjects. The effect of B pullicaecorum on trinitrobenzenesulfonic
      (TNBS)-induced colitis was assessed and the effect of B pullicaecorum culture
      supernatant on epithelial barrier function was investigated in vitro. RESULTS:
      The average number of Butyricicoccus in stools from patients with UC and CD in
      active (UC: 8.61 log10/g stool; CD: 6.58 log10/g stool) and remission phase (UC: 
      8.69 log10/g stool; CD: 8.38 log10/g stool) was significantly lower compared with
      healthy subjects (9.32 log10/g stool) and correlated with disease activity in CD.
      Oral administration of B pullicaecorum resulted in a significant protective
      effect based on macroscopic and histological criteria and decreased intestinal
      myeloperoxidase (MPO), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin
      (IL)-12 levels. Supernatant of B pullicaecorum prevented the loss of
      transepithelial resistance (TER) and the increase in IL-8 secretion induced by
      TNFalpha and interferon gamma (IFN gamma) in a Caco-2 cell model. CONCLUSIONS:
      Patients with inflammatory bowel disease have lower numbers of Butyricicoccus
      bacteria in their stools. Administration of B pullicaecorum attenuates
      TNBS-induced colitis in rats and supernatant of B pullicaecorum cultures
      strengthens the epithelial barrier function by increasing the TER.

AB  - Since the 1980s, EnterohaemorrhagicEscherichia coli (EHEC) have been recognised
      as emergent pathogens causing foodborne outbreaks. The latest one is the E. coli 
      O104:H4 outbreak which occurred in Germany in May 2011 then in France. In France,
      the surveillance of EHEC infections is based on surveillance of hemolytic-uremic 
      syndrome (HUS) in children under 15 years old. The average annual incidence is
      0.8/100,000 children under 15 years old with a predominance of the O157:H7
      serotype. EHEC are one of the six clinical pathovars of E. coli defined by their 
      capacity to produce Shiga-toxins and for that reason, are part of a larger group 
      called: Shigatoxin-producingE. coli (STEC). EHEC are a cause of different
      troubles ranging from mild diarrhea to haemorrhagic colitis which might be
      complicated by HUS in young children and thrombocytopenic thrombotic purpura in
      adults. The reservoir of EHEC is mainly the intestinal tract of ruminants: EHEC
      are transmitted via ingestion of contaminated food or water, person-to-person
      contact, direct animal contact and exposure to the environment. The diagnosis of 
      the EHEC infections relies on isolation of STEC in stool samples or detection of 
      genes encoding for Shiga-toxins. Treatment is mainly symptomatic. Use of
      antibiotics is controversial because the risk of HUS could be increased (release 
      of toxins).

TI  - Cutting edge: chemoprevention of colorectal neoplasia in inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 1-7
AB  - Colitis-associated cancer represents a long-standing problem, with two new
      factors adding to its importance: the diffusion of inflammatory bowel disease in 
      developing countries, and the increased availability of effective drugs that
      control ulcerative colitis delaying or abrogating the need for a curative
      colectomy. The consolidated evidence that inflammation is the unique variable
      that factors in colitic cancer development has conferred impetus to the search
      and release of anti-inflammatory/immune suppressive molecules to pursue the goal 
      of cancer chemoprevention. Cutting-edge research has provided breakthrough
      insights into the mechanism of the chemopreventive actions of mesalamines,
      thiopurines, and probiotics, and we expand on these topics. Despite these
      advancements, bedside evidence is still mixed and calls for further scrutiny.
      Nowadays, the clinician must continue to rely on classic preventive measures such
      as surveillance colonoscopy, and the early and aggressive use of drugs that
      permit to keep the degree of mucosal inflammation to a minimum.

TI  - DHA-enriched fish oil targets B cell lipid microdomains and enhances ex vivo and 
      in vivo B cell function.
PG  - 463-70
LID - 10.1189/jlb.0812394 [doi]
AB  - DHA is a n-3 LCPUFA in fish oil that generally suppresses T lymphocyte function. 
      However, the effect of fish oil on B cell function remains relatively
      understudied. Given the important role of B cells in gut immunity and increasing 
      human fish oil supplementation, we sought to determine whether DFO leads to
      enhanced B cell activation in the SMAD-/- colitis-prone mouse model, similar to
      that observed with C57BL/6 mice. This study tested the hypothesis that DHA from
      fish oil is incorporated into the B cell membrane to alter lipid microdomain
      clustering and enhance B cell function. Purified, splenic B cells from DFO-fed
      mice displayed increased DHA levels and diminished GM1 microdomain clustering.
      DFO enhanced LPS-induced B cell secretion of IL-6 and TNF-alpha and increased
      CD40 expression ex vivo compared with CON. Despite increased MHCII expression in 
      the unstimulated ex vivo B cells from DFO-fed mice, we observed no difference in 
      ex vivo OVA-FITC uptake in B cells from DFO or CON mice. In vivo, DFO increased
      lymphoid tissue B cell populations and surface markers of activation compared
      with CON. Finally, we investigated whether these ex vivo and in vivo observations
      were consistent with systemic changes. Indeed, DFO-fed mice had significantly
      higher plasma IL-5, IL-13, and IL-9 (Th2-biasing cytokines) and cecal IgA
      compared with CON. These results support the hypothesis and an emerging concept
      that fish oil enhances B cell function in vivo.

TI  - Reduced bone breakage and increased bone strength in free range laying hens fed
      omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplemented diets.
PG  - 578-86
LID - 10.1016/j.bone.2012.11.003 [doi]
LID - S8756-3282(12)01345-2 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are the
      immediate precursors to a number of important mediators of immunity, inflammation
      and bone function, with products of omega-6 generally thought to promote
      inflammation and favour bone resorption. Western diets generally provide a 10 to 
      20-fold deficit in omega-3 PUFAs compared with omega-6, and this is thought to
      have contributed to the marked rise in incidence of disorders of modern human
      societies, such as heart disease, colitis and perhaps osteoporosis. Many of our
      food production animals, fed on grains rich in omega-6, are also exposed to a
      dietary deficit in omega-3, with perhaps similar health consequences. Bone
      fragility due to osteoporotic changes in laying hens is a major economic and
      welfare problem, with our recent estimates of breakage rates indicating up to 95%
      of free range hens suffer breaks during lay. METHODS: Free range hens housed in
      full scale commercial systems were provided diets supplemented with omega-3 alpha
      linolenic acid, and the skeletal benefits were investigated by comparison to
      standard diets rich in omega-6. RESULTS: There was a significant 40-60% reduction
      in keel bone breakage rate, and a corresponding reduction in breakage severity in
      the omega-3 supplemented hens. There was significantly greater bone density and
      bone mineral content, alongside increases in total bone and trabecular volumes.
      The mechanical properties of the omega-3 supplemented hens were improved, with
      strength, energy to break and stiffness demonstrating significant increases.
      Alkaline phosphatase (an osteoblast marker) and tartrate-resistant acid
      phosphatase (an osteoclast marker) both showed significant increases with the
      omega-3 diets, indicating enhanced bone turnover. This was corroborated by the
      significantly lower levels of the mature collagen crosslinks, hydroxylysyl
      pyridinoline, lysyl pyridinoline and histidinohydroxy-lysinonorleucine, with a
      corresponding significant shift in the mature:immature crosslink ratio.
      CONCLUSIONS: The improved skeletal health in laying hens corresponds to as many
      as 68million fewer hens suffering keel fractures in the EU each year. The
      biomechanical and biochemical evidence suggests that increased bone turnover has 
      enhanced the bone mechanical properties, and that this may suggest potential
      benefits for human osteoporosis.

TI  - Allergic colitis in monozygotic preterm twins.
PG  - 198-201
LID - 10.3109/08923973.2012.734511 [doi]
AB  - Allergic colitis (AC) typically develops in the first weeks or months of life and
      is characterized by the presence of red blood in the stools of healthy breastfed 
      or formula fed infants. In this paper, we describe a case of rectal bleeding in
      monozygotic preterm twins that was resolved with the introduction of a cow's milk
      protein-free diet (CMPFD). The occurrence of this disorder in monozygotic twins
      raises the question as to whether the underlying abnormality in the immune
      regulation, which leads to poor acquisition of tolerance to cow's milk proteins, 
      might be inherited or environmentally acquired. The case also highlights the use 
      of the probiotic Lactobacillus GG (LGG) in the treatment of allergic colitis.

TI  - Tolerability of curcumin in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease: a forced-dose
      titration study.
PG  - 277-9
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e318276977d [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by chronic
      intestinal inflammation in the absence of a recognized etiology. The primary
      therapies are medications that possess anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive
      effects. Given the high use of complementary alternative medicines in pediatric
      IBD, a prospective tolerability study of curcumin, an herbal therapy with known
      anti-inflammatory effects, was conducted to assess possible dosage in children
      with IBD. METHODS: Prospectively, patients with Crohn disease or ulcerative
      colitis in remission or with mild disease (Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity
      Index [PCDAI] <30 or Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index [PUCAI] score
      <34) were enrolled in a tolerability study. All patients received curcumin in
      addition to their standard therapy. Patients initially received 500 mg twice per 
      day for 3 weeks. Using the forced-dose titration design, doses were increased up 
      to 1 g twice per day at week 3 for a total of 3 weeks and then titrated again to 
      2 g twice per day at week 6 for 3 weeks. Validated measures of disease activity, 
      using the PUCAI and PCDAI, and the Monitoring of Side Effect System score were
      obtained at weeks 3, 6, and 9. RESULTS: All patients tolerated curcumin well,
      with the only symptom that was consistently reported during all 3 visits being an
      increase in gassiness, which occurred in only 2 patients. Three patients saw
      improvement in PUCAI/PCDAI score. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests that
      curcumin may be used as an adjunctive therapy for individuals seeking a
      combination of conventional medicine and alternative medicine.

TI  - T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas reported to the FDA AERS with tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors: results of the REFURBISH study.
PG  - 99-105
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2012.334 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) with tumor necrosis factor
      alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors is unclear, whether related to concomitant
      thiopurines usage or due to the underlying inflammatory disease. We sought to
      review all cases of T-cell NHL reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      in patients receiving TNF-alpha inhibitors for all approved indications and
      examine the risk of T-cell NHL with TNF-alpha inhibitors in comparison with the
      use of thiopurines in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: The FDA Adverse 
      Event Reporting System (AERS) was queried for all lymphomas following treatment
      with the following TNF-alpha inhibitors: infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab,
      etanercept, and their trade names. Full reports for T-cell NHL cases were
      identified using the Freedom of Information Act. In addition, T-cell NHL reported
      in patients IBD with the use of the thiopurines-azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine,
      and their trade names were also collected. A search of MEDLINE was performed for 
      additional T-cell NHL with TNF-alpha inhibitors or thiopurines, not reported to
      the FDA but available in published literature. The histological subtypes of
      T-cell NHL reported with TNF-alpha inhibitors were compared with reported
      subtypes in Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) -17 registry.
      Reported risk of T-cell NHL in IBD with TNF-alpha inhibitors, thiopurines, or
      concomitant use was calculated using Fisher's exact test using 5-aminosalicylates
      as control drugs. RESULTS: A total of 3,130,267 reports were downloaded from the 
      FDA AERS (2003-2010). Ninety-one cases of T-cell NHL with TNF-alpha inhibitors
      were identified in the FDA AERS and nine additional cases were identified on
      MEDLINE search. A total of 38 patients had rheumatoid arthritis, 36 cases had
      Crohn's disease, 11 had psoriasis, 9 had ulcerative colitis, and 6 had ankylosing
      spondylitis. Sixty-eight of the cases (68%) involved exposure to both a TNF-alpha
      inhibitor and an immunomodulator (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate,
      leflunomide, or cyclosporine). Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) was the most
      common reported subtype, whereas mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome and HSTCL were
      identified as more common with TNF-alpha-inhibitor exposure compared with SEER-17
      registry. Nineteen cases of T-cell NHL with thiopurines were identified in the
      FDA AERS and one additional case on MEDLINE. Reported risk of T-cell NHL was
      higher with TNF-alpha inhibitor use in combination with thiopurines (95%
      confidence interval (CI) 4.98-354.09; P<0.0001) and thiopurines alone (95% CI
      8.32-945.38; P<0.0001) but not with TNF-alpha inhibitor use alone (95% CI
      0.13-10.61; P=1.00). CONCLUSIONS: Risk of T-cell NHL is increased with TNF-alpha 
      inhibitor use in combination with thiopurines but not with TNF-alpha inhibitors
      alone.

AB  - Ginger is a commonly used spice with anti-inflammatory potential. Colitis is the 
      common pathological lesion of inflammatory bowel diseases. In this study, we
      investigated the therapeutic effects of ginger and its component zingerone in
      mice with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis. Ginger and
      zingerone ameliorated TNBS-induced colonic injury in a dose-dependent manner.
      Pathway analysis of ginger- and zingerone-regulated gene expression profiles
      showed that ginger and zingerone significantly regulated cytokine-related
      pathways. Network analysis showed that nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and
      interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) were key molecules involved in the expression of
      ginger- and zingerone-affected genes. Ex vivo imaging and immunohistochemical
      staining further verified that ginger and zingerone suppressed TNBS-induced
      NF-kappaB activation and IL-1beta protein level in the colon. In conclusion,
      ginger improved TNBS-induced colitis via modulation of NF-kappaB activity and
      IL-1beta signalling pathway. Moreover, zingerone might be the active component of
      ginger responsible for the amelioration of colitis induced by TNBS.

AB  - The essential micronutrient zinc has long been known to be a functional component
      of diverse structural proteins and enzymes. More recently, important roles for
      free or loosely bound intracellular zinc as a signaling factor have been
      reported. Insufficient zinc intake was shown to exacerbate symptoms in mouse
      models of inflammation such as experimental colitis, while zinc supplementation
      was found to improve intestinal barrier function. Herein, we provide evidence
      that intracellular zinc is essential for maintaining intestinal epithelial
      integrity when cells are exposed to the inflammatory cytokine Tumor Necrosis
      Factor (TNF)alpha. Using the human intestinal Caco-2/TC7 cell line as an in vitro
      model, we demonstrate that depletion of intracellular zinc affects
      TNFalpha-triggered signaling by shifting intestinal cell fate from survival to
      death. The mechanism underlying this effect was investigated. We show that
      TNFalpha promotes a zinc-dependent survival pathway that includes modulation of
      gene expression of transcription factors and signaling proteins. We have
      identified multiple regulatory steps regulated by zinc availability which include
      the induction of cellular Inhibitor of APoptosis (cIAP2) mRNA, possibly through
      activation of Nuclear Factor-Kappa B (NF-kappaB), as both nuclear translocation
      of the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB and up-regulation of cIAP2 mRNA were impaired
      following zinc depletion. Moreover, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein level
      was profoundly reduced by zinc depletion. Our results provide a possible
      molecular explanation for the clinical observation that zinc supplements
      ameliorate Crohn's disease symptoms and decrease intestinal permeability in
      experimental colitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A significant fraction of patients with ulcerative colitis
      (UC) is not sufficiently controlled with conventional therapy or suffers from
      therapy related side effects. Anthocyanins, highly abundant in bilberries
      (Vaccinium myrtillus), were shown to have antioxidative and anti-inflammatory
      effects. We aimed to explore the therapeutic potential of bilberries in active
      UC. METHODS: In an open pilot trial with a total follow-up of 9 weeks the effect 
      of a daily standardized anthocyanin-rich bilberry preparation was tested in 13
      patients with mild to moderate UC. Clinical, biochemical, endoscopic and
      histologic parameters were assessed. RESULTS: At the end of the 6 week treatment 
      interval 63.4% of patients achieved remission, the primary endpoint, while 90.9% 
      of patients showed a response. In all patients a decrease in total Mayo score was
      detected (mean: 6.5 and 3.6 at screening and week 7, respectively; p<0.001).
      Fecal calprotectin levels significantly decreased during the treatment phase
      (baseline: mean 778 mug/g, range 192-1790 mug/g; end of treatment: mean 305
      mug/g, range <30-1586 mug/g; p=0.049), including 4 patients achieving
      undetectable levels at end of treatment. A decrease in endoscopic Mayo score and 
      histologic Riley index confirmed the beneficial effect. However, an increase of
      calprotectin levels and disease activity was observed after cessation of bilberry
      intake. No serious adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first
      report on the promising therapeutic potential of a standardized anthocyanin-rich 
      bilberry preparation in UC in humans. These results clearly indicate a
      therapeutic potential of bilberries in UC. Further studies on mechanisms and
      randomized clinical trials are warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment resistant chronic pouchitis causes significant morbidity.
      Elemental diet is effective treatment for Crohn's disease. Since pouchitis shares
      some similarities to Crohn's disease we hypothesised that elemental diet may be
      an effective treatment. METHOD: Seven pouchitis patients (with ulcerative
      colitis) were studied. All had active pouchitis with a pouch disease activity
      index (PDAI) >/=7. Exclusion criteria were recent NSAIDs, antibiotics or
      probiotics. Sufficient elemental diet to achieve energy requirements was
      provided. Flexible-pouchoscopy was performed, and the Cleveland Global Quality of
      Life score (CGQoL), Pouch Disease Activity Index (PDAI) and BMI were recorded at 
      baseline and following 28 days of elemental diet. Faecal samples were also
      collected at these time points and analysed for major bacterial groups using
      culture independent fluorescence in situ hybridisation. Data were analysed using 
      Wilcoxon's signed-rank test. RESULTS: Following 28 days of exclusive elemental
      diet, median stool frequency decreased from 12 to 6 per day (p=0.028), median
      clinical PDAI decreased from 4 to 1 (p=0.039). There was no significant
      difference in quality of life scores or PDAI before and following treatment.
      There was a trend towards an increase in the concentration of Clostridium
      coccoides-Eubacterium rectale (median 7.9 to 8.5 log(1)(0)/g, p=0.08) following
      exclusive elemental diet. CONCLUSION: Treatment with four weeks elemental diet
      appeared to improve the symptoms of chronic pouchitis in some patients but is not
      an effective strategy for inducing remission. Although a potential symptom
      modifier, elemental diet cannot be recommended for the routine treatment of
      active pouchitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A six-week course of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is
      recommended as first treatment in active paediatric Crohn's disease (CD). We
      aimed to assess short-term and long-term outcome of EEN, and to identify
      predictive factors of treatment success. METHODS: The medical records of newly
      diagnosed paediatric CD patients initiating EEN as remission induction therapy
      between January 2008 and October 2011 were retrospectively studied. Treatment
      outcome was assessed using a previously described pattern recognition model.
      RESULTS: 77 CD patients (median age 13.9 years, 57% male) initiated a six-week
      course of EEN, combined with azathioprine maintenance treatment in 92%. Patients 
      received EEN as either hyperosmolar sip feeds or polymeric formula by nasogastric
      tube. In patients completing a six-week course of EEN (n=58), complete remission 
      was achieved in 71%, partial remission in 26%, and no response in 3%. Complete
      remission rates were higher in children presenting with isolated ileal/ileocaecal
      disease and malnutrition. Nineteen patients discontinued EEN before the intended 
      treatment period due to worsening of symptoms (n=9) or adherence issues (n=10).
      Non-adherence occurred more often in older children, females, children from
      non-Dutch parents, and patients taking hyperosmolar sip feeds compared with
      polymeric formula by nasogastric tube. The likelihood of relapsing disease within
      the first year after EEN treatment was 59%. CONCLUSION: A six-week course of EEN 
      is effective in newly diagnosed paediatric CD, with response rates that seem to
      be influenced by disease location and nutritional status, but not by type of
      formula. Non-adherence occurs frequently and limits the success of this treatment
      in everyday clinical practice.

AB  - IBD is a chronic and relapsing inflammatory disorder of the gut that demands
      long-lasting treatment targeting both flare-up periods and maintenance of
      remission. Oral systemic steroids have been used to induce remission in patients 
      with active IBD for over 50 years due to their potent anti-inflammatory effects. 
      The efficacy of systemic steroids in this setting has been largely demonstrated. 
      However, the wide range of adverse events associated with these drugs has
      prompted the development of equally effective but less toxic steroid compounds.
      Currently, topically acting oral steroids are an important therapeutic option for
      Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and microscopic colitis, being oral
      budesonide and oral beclomethasone established elements of the IBD armamentarium.
      At present, oral budesonide is the first-line therapy to induce remission in
      microscopic colitis and mild to moderate ileocaecal CD patients and oral
      beclomethasone is effective treating mild to moderate UC patients with left-sided
      or extensive disease. This review aims at evaluating the current role of these
      compounds in IBD clinical practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Decreased bone mineral density (BMD) is common in Crohn's
      disease (CD) patients. This paper reports on the prevalence of decreased BMD in a
      referral cohort study of CD-patients next to the change of BMD over time in
      relation with CD-associated clinical characteristics. METHODS: 205 CD patients of
      a referral hospital were enrolled between January1998-January 2010 when
      measurement of BMD by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was available. Follow-up
      DXA scan was performed in subjects with known risk factors besides Crohn
      indicative for low BMD. Treatment of CD patients was according to a protocol
      which is comparable to the current (inter)national guidelines. In osteopenic
      patients, supplemental vitamin D (800 IU) and Calcium (500-1000 mg) were
      prescribed. RESULTS: Mean BMD at baseline was 0.97 +/- 0.16 gram/cm(2) in lumbar 
      spine and 0.87 +/- 0.12 gram/cm(2) in the total hip. At baseline, higher age and 
      low Body Mass Index (BMI), were negatively correlated with BMD. Eighty-four
      patients underwent a second BMD assessment with a median interval period of 4
      years (IQR 3-6). A mean annual increase of +0.76% (95%CI: -2.63%; +3.87%) in
      lumbar spine and +0.43% (95%CI: -2.65% ; +1.11%) in total hip was observed.
      CONCLUSIONS: Higher age, male sex, low BMI, and a higher age at diagnosis of CD
      were associated with low BMD. Follow-up of BMD in CD patients showed a
      contraintuitive small increase of BMD at lumbar spine and total hip in CD
      patients only using supplemental vitamin D and calcium next to strict treatment
      of CD.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To identify environmental risk factors for developing
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children <15 years of age. METHODS: IBD
      patients and randomly selected healthy controls from a well defined geographical 
      area in Denmark were prospectively recruited in the period 1.1.2007-31.12.2009.
      Data regarding socioeconomic status, area of residence, living conditions,
      infections and diet were obtained by a questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 118 IBD
      patients (59 Crohn's disease (CD), 56 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 3 IBD
      unclassified (IBDU)) and 477 healthy controls filled out the questionnaire. The
      response rates were 91% in patients and 45% in controls, respectively. Several
      risk factors for IBD were identified: IBD in first degree relatives (IBD: OR
      (odds ratio): 6.1 (95%CI: 2.5-15.0), CD (OR: 6.8 (2.3-20.2)) and UC (OR: 6.1
      (2.3-16.0))); bedroom sharing (IBD: OR: 2.1 (1.0-4.3), CD (OR: 3.6 (1.3-9.4)));
      high sugar intake (IBD: OR: 2.5 (1.0-6.2), CD (OR: 2.9 (1.0-8.5))); prior
      admission to a hospital for gastrointestinal infections (IBD: 7.7 (3.1-19.1), CD 
      (7.9 (2.5-24.9)) and UC (7.4 (2.5-21.6))); stressful events (IBD: 1.7 (1.0-2.9)).
      Protective factors were daily vs. less than daily vegetable consumption (CD: 0.3 
      (0.1-1.0), UC (0.3 (0.1-0.8))) and whole meal bread consumption (IBD: OR: 0.5
      (0.3-0.9), CD (0.4 (0.2-0.9))). An increased risk of diagnosis of CD compared to 
      UC was shown for patients living in more urban areas (OR: 1.3 (1.1-1.6)).
      CONCLUSION: We identified several risk and protective factors for developing IBD.
      Studies on the influence of environmental factors are important in our
      understanding of aetiology and phenotypes of paediatric IBD.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel disease, a chronic inflammation of the
      intestinal tract, presents in two variations, Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn's
      disease (CD). Given that treatment of CD differs from UC, a single test that
      provided strong diagnostic ability would offer great clinical value. Two previous
      studies have indicated that CD can be distinguished from UC, and that both can be
      distinguished from non-IBD-type gastrointestinal disease, based on urinary and
      faecal metabolite profiling. METHODS: Analysis of healthy as well as CD and UC
      patients attending an IBD clinic was performed. IBD patients were classified into
      two groups (CD or UC) based on chart review of clinical, endoscopic, and
      histological assessment. Urine samples were obtained and analyzed using nuclear
      magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy combined with targeted profiling
      techniques, followed by univariate and multivariate statistical analysis.
      RESULTS: Based on urinary metabolomics, individuals with IBD could be
      differentiated from healthy. Major differences between IBD and healthy included
      TCA cycle intermediates, amino acids, and gut microflora metabolites. Comparison 
      of CD and UC patients revealed discrimination, but removal of patients with the
      surgical intervention confounder revealed that CD could not be discriminated from
      UC. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the potential for metabolomics to
      distinguish IBD from the healthy state but shows that careful consideration must 
      be given to establishing disease-representative cohorts that are free of
      confounding factors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diverticulitis due to diverticulosis of the colon is a common
      clinical problem with a high morbidity and socio-economic consequences. Frequent 
      clinical signs are flatulence, abdominal pain, stool problems which may often be 
      misinterpreted as the symptoms of an irritable bowel or a colitis. Accordingly,
      the diagnostic work-up must be adequate to allow for the stage-adapted planning
      and performance of the therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The following questions
      will be addressed in this review: What do we need to clarify diagnosis? Which
      antibiotics should be used? What is the best conservative approach for treatment?
      RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Basic conservative therapy consists of systemic
      antibiosis which can be extended by a topical antibiosis, and administration of
      aspirin as well as probiotics. The indications for a specific therapy is made on 
      an individual basis according to stage (Hansen and Stock). Above all, a "team
      approach" and close communication between gastroenterologists and surgeons are
      mandatory for adequate treatment of these patients.
