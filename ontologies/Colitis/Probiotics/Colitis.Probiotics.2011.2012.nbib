TI  - Anti-inflammatory Lactobacillus rhamnosus CNCM I-3690 strain protects against
      oxidative stress and increases lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans.
PG  - e52493
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0052493 [doi]
AB  - Numerous studies have shown that resistance to oxidative stress is crucial to
      stay healthy and to reduce the adverse effects of aging. Accordingly, nutritional
      interventions using antioxidant food-grade compounds or food products are
      currently an interesting option to help improve health and quality of life in the
      elderly. Live lactic acid bacteria (LAB) administered in food, such as
      probiotics, may be good antioxidant candidates. Nevertheless, information about
      LAB-induced oxidative stress protection is scarce. To identify and characterize
      new potential antioxidant probiotic strains, we have developed a new functional
      screening method using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as host. C. elegans
      were fed on different LAB strains (78 in total) and nematode viability was
      assessed after oxidative stress (3 mM and 5 mM H(2)O(2)). One strain, identified 
      as Lactobacillus rhamnosus CNCM I-3690, protected worms by increasing their
      viability by 30% and, also, increased average worm lifespan by 20%. Moreover,
      transcriptomic analysis of C. elegans fed with this strain showed that increased 
      lifespan is correlated with differential expression of the DAF-16/insulin-like
      pathway, which is highly conserved in humans. This strain also had a clear
      anti-inflammatory profile when co-cultured with HT-29 cells, stimulated by
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, and co-culture systems with HT-29 cells and DC in the
      presence of LPS. Finally, this Lactobacillus strain reduced inflammation in a
      murine model of colitis. This work suggests that C. elegans is a fast, predictive
      and convenient screening tool to identify new potential antioxidant probiotic
      strains for subsequent use in humans.

TI  - Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1745-52
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2012-303611 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Many species within the phylum Firmicutes are thought to exert
      anti-inflammatory effects. We quantified bacteria belonging to the genus
      Butyricicoccus in stools of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's
      disease (CD). We evaluated the effect of Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum in a rat
      colitis model and analysed the ability to prevent cytokine-induced increases in
      epithelial permeability. DESIGN: A genus-specific quantitative PCR was used for
      quantification of Butyricicoccus in stools from patients with UC or CD and
      healthy subjects. The effect of B pullicaecorum on trinitrobenzenesulfonic
      (TNBS)-induced colitis was assessed and the effect of B pullicaecorum culture
      supernatant on epithelial barrier function was investigated in vitro. RESULTS:
      The average number of Butyricicoccus in stools from patients with UC and CD in
      active (UC: 8.61 log10/g stool; CD: 6.58 log10/g stool) and remission phase (UC: 
      8.69 log10/g stool; CD: 8.38 log10/g stool) was significantly lower compared with
      healthy subjects (9.32 log10/g stool) and correlated with disease activity in CD.
      Oral administration of B pullicaecorum resulted in a significant protective
      effect based on macroscopic and histological criteria and decreased intestinal
      myeloperoxidase (MPO), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin
      (IL)-12 levels. Supernatant of B pullicaecorum prevented the loss of
      transepithelial resistance (TER) and the increase in IL-8 secretion induced by
      TNFalpha and interferon gamma (IFN gamma) in a Caco-2 cell model. CONCLUSIONS:
      Patients with inflammatory bowel disease have lower numbers of Butyricicoccus
      bacteria in their stools. Administration of B pullicaecorum attenuates
      TNBS-induced colitis in rats and supernatant of B pullicaecorum cultures
      strengthens the epithelial barrier function by increasing the TER.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of probiotics in
      various areas of gastrointestinal (GI) health. Probiotics are defined as live
      microorganisms that provide beneficial health effects on the host when
      administered in adequate amounts. Various probiotics have been shown to suppress 
      bacterial growth, modulate the immune system and improve intestinal barrier
      function. However, despite several studies with promising results, most trials
      are small and many have substantial methodological limitations. However, with
      better targeting and appropriate randomised controlled trials, this area may soon
      yield important therapeutic strategies to optimise GI health. Here, we review the
      current knowledge of probiotics of relevance to luminal GI health.

AB  - Escherichia coli O157:H7 is a notorious pathogen often contracted by intake of
      contaminated water or food. Infection with this agent is associated with a broad 
      spectrum of illness ranging from mild diarrhea and hemorrhagic colitis to the
      potentially fatal hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Treating E. coli O157:H7
      infection with antimicrobial agents is associated with an increased risk of
      severe sequelae such as HUS. The difficulty in treating this bacterium using
      conventional modalities of antimicrobial agent administration has sparked an
      interest in investigating new therapeutic approaches to this bacterium. These
      approaches have included the use of probiotic agents and natural products with
      variable success rates. In addition, novel modalities and regimen of
      antimicrobial agent administration have been assessed in an attempt at decreasing
      their association with aggravating infection outcomes.

AB  - Definitive curative strategies for inflammatory bowel disease remain challenging 
      for physicians and patients. For decades, probiotic organisms have been used in
      various gastrointestinal diseases. Only recently has comprehension of the
      pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease developed to the point where the
      significance of the host gastrointestinal microbial population is seen to have
      marked influence on the initiation and ongoing inflammatory processes of Crohn
      disease and ulcerative colitis. Well-designed, large randomized controlled trials
      using probiotics in patients with inflammatory bowel disease are required for
      probiotics to become mainstream therapy.

      exceeding all other gastrointestinal infections combined. There has been a
      dramatic increase in Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) worldwide during the
      past decade. Antibiotic therapy is a trigger precipitating antibiotic-associated 
      diarrhea (AAD), which may lead to CDI. The antibiotic alters the protective,
      diverse bacteria allowing pathogenic bacteria to cause disease. Probiotics have
      been effective in reducing AAD and preventing CDI.

TI  - The microbiome and inflammatory bowel disease: is there a therapeutic role for
      fecal microbiota transplantation?
PG  - 1452-9
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2012.93 [doi]
AB  - One hypothesis for the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease is that an altered 
      or pathogenic microbiota causes inflammation in a genetically susceptible
      individual. Understanding the microbiota's role in the pathogenesis of the
      disease could lead to new IBD treatments aimed at shifting the bacteria in the
      gut back to eubiosis. Probiotics have some efficacy in the treatment of
      ulcerative colitis (UC), but our current repertoire is limited in potency. Fecal 
      microbiota therapy (FMT) is an emerging treatment for several gastrointestinal
      and metabolic disorders. It has demonstrated efficacy in treating refractory
      Clostridium difficile infection, and there are case reports of FMT successfully
      treating UC. Further clinical studies are justified, and could be complemented by
      mouse models of fecal transplantation, in which variables can be controlled and
      manipulated.

TI  - [Probiotics have a limited role in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease].
PG  - A5206
AB  - Probiotics are frequently prescribed for the treatment of inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). However, supporting evidence for the use of probiotics in IBD is
      scarce. Most studies are limited by design or do not show that probiotic
      treatment is effective. Only a few randomised controlled trials have demonstrated
      any beneficial effect of probiotic use in IBD; namely, the use of VSL#3 in
      patients with pouchitis and ulcerative colitis. So far, the efficacy of
      probiotics in the treatment of Crohn's disease has not been clearly demonstrated.
      Furthermore, issues pertaining to their mechanisms of action, dosages and dosing 
      intervals, safety, and health insurance coverage are currently unresolved. Given 
      the limited body of evidence of their efficacy from controlled trials and the
      many unanswered questions on probiotic treatment, we recommend following the
      evidence obtained from well-designed randomised controlled trials and only
      prescribing probiotic treatment (e.g. VSL #3) for the prevention of pouchitis and
      the treatment of patients with mildly active ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Irritable bowel syndrome; update on pathophysiology and management.
PG  - 313-22
AB  - The description of the de novo development of irritable bowel syndrome following 
      an episode of bacterial gastroenteritis (pos-infectious irritable bowel syndrome)
      illustrated the potential for a luminal factor (a bacterial pathogen) to cause
      this common gastrointestinal ailment. As a consequence of these and other
      observations, as well as results of experiments involving animal models, the
      enteric flora and the immune response that it generates in the host have,
      somewhat surprisingly, come centre-stage in irritable bowel syndrome research,
      given their potential to induce the pathophysiological changes that are
      associated with irritable bowel syndrome. While evidence for immune dysfunction
      both in the mucosa and systemically continues to accumulate, methodological
      limitations have hampered a full delineation of the nature of the microbiota in
      irritable bowel syndrome. The latter is eagerly awaited and may yet provide a
      firm rationale for the use of certain probiotics and antibiotics in irritable
      bowel syndrome, whose benefits have now been described with some consistency.
      Despite its prevalence, there is a striking lack of effective therapeutic options
      for irritable bowel syndrome. While there is reason for optimism in the
      management of irritable bowel syndrome with several promising new agents
      currently undergoing clinical trials, confirmation of the efficacy and safety of 
      these agents in wider patient populations is awaited. A clearer understanding of 
      the physiopathologic mechanisms underlying irritable bowel syndrome, as well as
      of interrelationships between irritable bowel syndrome and other gastrointestinal
      and non-gastrointestinal disorders, will likely be required before effective drug
      therapies can be found.

      ulcerative colitis].
PG  - 94-101
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic disease that
      characteristically has a relapsing and remitting course. Probiotics might
      possibly induce remission in the treatment of active UC. Aims of our study were
      to assess the efficacy of VSL#3 on clinical response and colonic tissue cytokine 
      concentration changes in patients with active UC. METHODS: Twenty-four eligible
      patients with mild to moderate UC received open-label VSL#3 4 sachets daily in 2 
      divided doses for 8 weeks. The disease activity pre- and post-VSL#3 therapy was
      assessed by ulcerative colitis disease activity score and colonic tissue cytokine
      profiling done at baseline and at week 8. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (mean
      age, 43.7 years; range, 20-70 years; male/female, 15/9) were enrolled and 2
      patients did not have the final endoscopic assessment. A total of 22 patients
      were analyzed. Intent to treat analysis demonstrated remission in 45.8% of
      subjects (n=11); partial response in 20.8% (n=5); no change or worse in 25.0%
      (n=6) of subjects. The mean ulcerative colitis disease activity index (UCDAI)
      scores decreased from 7.09+/-1.81 to 1.45+/-1.29 in patients with a remission
      (p<0.001). The mean endoscopic scores had also significantly decreased from
      1.91+/-0.54 to 0.63+/-0.50 in patients with a remission (p<0.001). The
      concentrations of colonic cytokines did not change significantly during treatment
      in patients with a remission. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that VSL#3 is
      effective in achieving clinical responses and remissions in patients with mild-to
      moderately active UC, further supporting the potential role in UC therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment resistant chronic pouchitis causes significant morbidity.
      Elemental diet is effective treatment for Crohn's disease. Since pouchitis shares
      some similarities to Crohn's disease we hypothesised that elemental diet may be
      an effective treatment. METHOD: Seven pouchitis patients (with ulcerative
      colitis) were studied. All had active pouchitis with a pouch disease activity
      index (PDAI) >/=7. Exclusion criteria were recent NSAIDs, antibiotics or
      probiotics. Sufficient elemental diet to achieve energy requirements was
      provided. Flexible-pouchoscopy was performed, and the Cleveland Global Quality of
      Life score (CGQoL), Pouch Disease Activity Index (PDAI) and BMI were recorded at 
      baseline and following 28 days of elemental diet. Faecal samples were also
      collected at these time points and analysed for major bacterial groups using
      culture independent fluorescence in situ hybridisation. Data were analysed using 
      Wilcoxon's signed-rank test. RESULTS: Following 28 days of exclusive elemental
      diet, median stool frequency decreased from 12 to 6 per day (p=0.028), median
      clinical PDAI decreased from 4 to 1 (p=0.039). There was no significant
      difference in quality of life scores or PDAI before and following treatment.
      There was a trend towards an increase in the concentration of Clostridium
      coccoides-Eubacterium rectale (median 7.9 to 8.5 log(1)(0)/g, p=0.08) following
      exclusive elemental diet. CONCLUSION: Treatment with four weeks elemental diet
      appeared to improve the symptoms of chronic pouchitis in some patients but is not
      an effective strategy for inducing remission. Although a potential symptom
      modifier, elemental diet cannot be recommended for the routine treatment of
      active pouchitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Reducing symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) by
      dietary supplements represents more than ever an attractive clinical approach.
      Since the use of spore forming bacteria may offer interesting advantages, the aim
      of the study was to address the anti-inflammatory potential of Bacillus >subtilis
      strain PB6 (ATCC - PTA 6737) spores, provided as a powder preparation. METHODS:
      The immunomodulatory potential of strain PB6 was first characterized in vitro on 
      human immunocompetent cells for both the commercial spore powder (Anaban) and two
      phenotypic variants of the vegetative form. Assessment of the in vivo
      anti-inflammatory capacity of the standard spore powder and a variant spore
      powder preparation was performed using a mouse model of acute, TNBS-induced
      colitis. Performance was compared with the drug prednisolone, and was based on
      blinded macroscopic and histological scores, blood inflammatory markers and
      measurements of infiltration of mucosal neutrophils. RESULTS: Strain PB6 induced 
      substantial levels of IL-10 but very low levels of IL-12, TNFalpha and IFNgamma
      on human PBMC. Both spore powders prevented colitis as shown by significant
      reductions of near all inflammatory read-outs. CONCLUSION: B. subtilis strain
      PB6, provided as a preparation of spores, shows pre-clinical anti-inflammatory
      effects, suggesting further evaluation in a clinical intervention trial, e.g.
      with IBD type patients.

AB  - The probiotic Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 (EcN) is one of the few
      probiotics licensed as a medication in several countries. Best documented is its 
      effectiveness in keeping patients suffering from ulcerative colitis (UC) in
      remission. This might be due to its ability to induce the production of human
      beta-defensin 2 (HBD2) in a flagellin-dependent way in intestinal epithelial
      cells. In contrast to ulcerative colitis, for Crohn's disease (CD) convincing
      evidence is lacking that EcN might be clinically effective, most likely due to
      the genetically based inability of sufficient defensin production in CD patients.
      As a first step in the development of an alternative approach for the treatment
      of CD patients, EcN strains were constructed which were able to produce human
      alpha-defensin 5 (HD5) or beta-defensin 2 (HBD2). For that purpose,
      codon-optimized defensin genes encoding either the proform with the signal
      sequence of human alpha-defensin 5 (HD5) or the gene encoding HBD2 with or
      without the signal sequence were cloned in an expression vector plasmid under the
      control of the T7 promoter. Synthesis of the encoded defensins was shown by
      Western blots after induction of expression and lysis of the recombinant EcN
      strains. Recombinant mature HBD2 with an N-terminal His-tag could be purified by 
      Ni-column chromatography and showed antimicrobial activity against E. coli,
      Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes. In a second
      approach, that part of the HBD2 gene which encodes mature HBD2 was fused with the
      yebF gene. The resulting fusion protein YebFMHBD2 was secreted from the encoding 
      EcN mutant strain after induction of expression. Presence of YebFMHBD2 in the
      medium was not the result of leakage from the bacterial cells, as demonstrated in
      the spent culture supernatant by Western blots specific for beta-galactosidase
      and maltose-binding protein. The dialyzed and concentrated culture supernatant
      inhibited the growth of E. coli, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium and L.
      monocytogenes in radial diffusion assays as well as in liquid culture. This
      demonstrates EcN to be a suitable probiotic E. coli strain for the production of 
      certain defensins.

AB  - In vitro and animals models have long been used to study human diseases and
      identify novel therapeutic approaches that can be applied to combat these
      conditions. Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are the two main entities of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). There is an intricate relationship between IBD 
      features in human patients, in vitro and animal colitis models, mechanisms and
      possible therapeutic approaches in these models, and strategies that can be
      extrapolated and applied in humans. Malnutrition, particularly protein-energy
      malnutrition and vitamin and micronutrient deficiencies, as well as dysregulation
      of the intestinal microbiota, are common features of IBD. Based on these
      observations, dietary supplementation with essential nutrients known to be in
      short supply in the diet in IBD patients and with other molecules believed to
      provide beneficial anti-inflammatory effects, as well as with probiotic organisms
      that stimulate immune functions and resistance to infection has been tested in
      colitis models. Here we review current knowledge on nutritional and probiotic
      supplementation in in vitro and animal colitis models. While some of these
      strategies require further fine-tuning before they can be applied in human IBD
      patients, their intended purpose is to prevent, delay or treat disease symptoms
      in a non-pharmaceutical manner.

TI  - Microscopic colitis: Current status, present and future challenges: statements of
      the European Microscopic Colitis Group.
PG  - 932-45
AB  - Microscopic colitis (MC) is an inflammatory bowel disease presenting with
      chronic, non-bloody watery diarrhoea and few or no endoscopic abnormalities. The 
      histological examination reveals mainly two subtypes of MC, lymphocytic or
      collagenous colitis. Despite the fact that the incidence in MC has been rising
      over the last decades, research has been sparse and our knowledge about MC
      remains limited. Specialists in the field have initiated the European Microscopic
      Colitis Group (EMCG) with the primary goal to create awareness on MC. The EMCG is
      furthermore a forum with the intention to promote clinical and basic research. In
      this article statements and comments are given that all members of the EMCG have 
      considered being of importance for a better understanding of MC. The paper
      focuses on the newest updates in epidemiology, symptoms and diagnostic criteria, 
      pathophysiology and highlights some unsolved problems. Moreover, a new treatment 
      algorithm is proposed on the basis of new evidence from well-designed, randomized
      control trials.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) encompassed several chronic inflammatory
      disorders leading to damage of the gastrointestinal tract (GI). The 2 principal
      forms of these disorders are ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD).
      Bacteria are involved in the etiology of IBD, and the genetic susceptibility,
      environmental factors, and lifestyle factors can affect the individual's
      predisposition to IBD. The review discusses the potential role of environmental
      factors such as diet and microbiota as well as genetics in the etiology of IBD.
      It is suggested that microbial ecosystem in the human bowel colonizing the gut in
      many different microhabitats can be influence by diet, leading to formation of
      metabolic processes that are essential form the bowel metabolism.

AB  - Probiotics are organisms which provide a desired and beneficial effect on human
      health. With recent evidence implicating a disruption in the balance of the
      gastrointestinal microbiome and intestinal immunity as a potential trigger for
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), there has been growing interest in using
      probiotics as an adjunct to standard anti-inflammatory and immune suppressing
      therapy. Animal models describe potential and plausible mechanisms of action for 
      probiotics to counter inflammation of colonic mucosa. Although there are
      insufficient data to recommend probiotics in ulcerative colitis or Crohn's
      disease, good evidence supports the use of specific probiotics for maintenance of
      remission in pouchitis. Although there are limited regulatory standards for the
      agents, probiotics are relatively safe with minimal reported side effects or
      contraindications. More rigorous studies need to be published supporting efficacy
      and safety of these agents before they become a mainstay of IBD medical
      treatment.

AB  - Symptomatic diverticular disease has a high prevalence in countries with a
      western lifestyle. Besides antibiotics for acute diverticulitis there are no
      established medical interventions to prevent or to treat symptomatic diverticular
      disease. Due to its broad spectrum of anti-inflammatory activities, mesalazine is
      a candidate for the treatment of symptomatic diverticular disease. A review of
      the literature shows that randomized open studies using various treatment designs
      suggest a protective role of mesalazine in preventing recurrences of
      diverticulitis. Currently, 5 randomized placebo-controlled trials are active
      which will clarify the role of mesalazine to prevent recurrence of diverticulitis
      in the near future. Several randomized uncontrolled studies suggest that
      mesalazine improves symptoms in patients with symptomatic uncomplicated
      diverticular disease. The analysis of secondary end points from two randomized
      placebo-controlled trials suggests that mesalazine improves symptoms in
      diverticular disease although both studies failed to show a statistically
      significant advantage for mesalazine for the primary study end point. In
      segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis no prospective systematic
      studies are available. However, several case reports show a high efficacy of
      mesalazine in segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis.

TI  - Advances in inflammatory bowel diseases in children.
PG  - 257-70
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic gastrointestinal condition that
      burdens the lives of many children around the world. It is characterized by
      chronic gastrointestinal inflammation. Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis
      and IBD-unknown are the three types of this disease. The management of children
      with inflammatory bowel disease is complex and requires skill, knowledge and
      experience with current advances in the field. Over the past several years, there
      have been a number of achievements and progress made in the care and management
      of this disorder. The diagnostic tools have greatly improved. The therapeutic
      armamentarium has expanded. The genetics of IBD has become more detailed and the 
      role of the gut microbiome has been better defined. The evolution of biological
      agents has revolutionized the way we approach this disease. This review
      highlights the recent advances in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease and
      provides an overview for clinicians caring for children with this disorder.

PG  - 1355-69

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diarrhoea is a common occurrence in association with antibiotic
      administration. Earlier studies and meta-analyses have suggested that probiotic
      administration reduces the incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD).
      AIM: To estimate the reduction in risk of AAD with administration of probiotics
      in randomised placebo-controlled trials and to identify factors associated with
      such reduction. METHODS: Meta-analysis of randomised, double-blinded,
      placebo-controlled trials including patients treated with antibiotics and
      administered a probiotic for at least the duration of the antibiotic treatment.
      The outcome was incidence of diarrhoea irrespective of the presence of
      Clostridium difficile or the development of pseudomembranous colitis.
      Meta-analysis and meta-regression methods were used to synthesise data and to
      assess influence of: mean age, duration of antibiotics, risk of bias and
      incidence of diarrhoea in the placebo group on outcomes. Subgroup analyses
      explored effects of different probiotic species, patient populations and
      treatment indications. RESULTS: A total of 34 studies were included with 4138
      patients. The pooled relative risk (RR) for AAD in the probiotic group vs.
      placebo was 0.53 (95% CI 0.44-0.63), corresponding to a number needed to treat
      (NNT) of 8 (95% CI 7-11). The preventive effect of probiotics remained
      significant when grouped by probiotic species, population age group, relative
      duration of antibiotics and probiotics, study risk of bias and probiotic
      administered. The pooled RR for AAD during treatment for Helicobacter pylori (H. 
      pylori) was 0.37 (95% CI 0.20-0.69), corresponding to a NNT of 5 (95% CI 4-10).
      CONCLUSIONS: This updated meta-analysis confirms earlier results supporting the
      preventive effects of probiotics in AAD.

AB  - The intestinal microbiota has been linked to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD),
      and oral treatment with specific bacteria can ameliorate IBD. One bacterial
      mixture, VSL#3, containing Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Streptococcus, was
      clinically shown to reduce inflammation in IBD patients and normalize intestinal 
      levels of IP-10, a lymphocyte-recruiting chemokine, in a murine colitis model. We
      identified Lactobacillus paracasei prtP-encoded lactocepin as a protease that
      selectively degrades secreted, cell-associated, and tissue-distributed IP-10,
      resulting in significantly reduced lymphocyte recruitment after intraperitoneal
      injection in an ileitis model. A human Lactobacillus casei isolate was also found
      to encode lactocepin and degrade IP-10. L. casei feeding studies in a murine
      colitis model (T cell transferred Rag2(-/-) mice) revealed that a prtP-disruption
      mutant was significantly less potent in reducing IP-10 levels, T cell
      infiltration and inflammation in cecal tissue compared to the isogenic wild-type 
      strain. Thus, lactocepin-based therapies may be effective treatments for
      chemokine-mediated diseases like IBD.

TI  - Probiotics in the management of inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review
      of intervention studies in adult patients.
PG  - 803-23
LID - 10.2165/11632710-000000000-00000 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Mounting evidence suggests an important role for the intestinal
      microbiota in the chronic mucosal inflammation that occurs in inflammatory bowel 
      disease (IBD), and novel molecular approaches have further identified a dysbiosis
      in these patients. Several mechanisms of action of probiotic products that may
      interfere with possible aetiological factors in IBD have been postulated.
      OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to discuss the rationale for probiotics in IBD and
      to systematically review clinical intervention studies with probiotics in the
      management of IBD in adults. METHODS: A systematic search was performed in PubMed
      up to 1 October 2011, using defined keywords. Only full-text papers in the
      English language addressing clinical outcomes in adult patients were included.
      The 41 eligible studies were categorized on disease type (ulcerative colitis [UC]
      with/without an ileo-anal pouch and Crohn's disease [CD]) and disease activity.
      Pooled odds ratios were only calculated per probiotic for a specific patient
      group when more than one randomized controlled trial was available. RESULTS: Well
      designed randomized controlled trials supporting the application of probiotics in
      the management of IBD are still limited. Meta-analyses could only be performed
      for a limited number of studies revealing overall risk ratios of 2.70 (95% CI
      0.47, 15.33) for inducing remission in active UC with Bifido-fermented milk
      versus placebo or no additive treatment (n = 2); 1.88 (95% CI 0.96, 3.67) for
      inducing remission in active UC with VSL#3 versus placebo (n = 2); 1.08 (95% CI
      0.86, 1.37) for preventing relapses in inactive UC with Escherichia coli Nissle
      1917 versus standard treatment (n = 3); 0.17 (95% CI 0.09, 0.33) for preventing
      relapses in inactive UC/ileo-anal pouch anastomosis (IPAA) patients with VSL#3
      versus placebo; 1.21 (95% CI 0.57, 2.57) for preventing endoscopic recurrences in
      inactive CD with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG versus placebo (n = 2); and 0.93 (95%
      CI 0.63, 1.38) for preventing endoscopic recurrences in inactive CD with
      Lactobacillus johnsonii versus placebo (n = 2). CONCLUSION: Further well designed
      studies based on intention-to-treat analyses by several independent research
      groups are still warranted to support the promising results for E. coli Nissle in
      inactive UC and the multispecies product VSL#3 in active UC and inactive pouch
      patients. So far, no evidence is available to support the use of probiotics in
      CD. Future studies should focus on specific disease subtypes and disease
      location. Further insight into the aetiology of IBD and the mechanisms of
      probiotic strains will aid in selecting probiotic strains for specific disease
      entities and disease locations.

TI  - Role of nutrition and microbiota in susceptibility to inflammatory bowel
      diseases.
PG  - 524-35
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201100630 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), Crohn's disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis 
      (UC) are chronic inflammatory conditions, which are increasing in incidence,
      prevalence, and severity, in many countries. While there is genetic
      susceptibility to IBD, the probability of disease development is modified by
      diet, lifestyle, and endogenous factors, including the gut microbiota. For
      example, high intakes of mono- and disaccharides, and total fats consistently
      increases the risk developing both forms of IBD. High vegetable intake reduces
      the risk of UC, whereas increased fruit and/or dietary fiber intake appears
      protective against CD. Low levels of certain micronutrients, especially vitamin
      D, may increase the risk of both diseases. Dietary patterns may be even more
      important to disease susceptibility than the levels of individual foods or
      nutrients. Various dietary regimes may modify disease symptoms, in part through
      their actions on the host microbiota. Both probiotics and prebiotics may modulate
      the microflora, and reduce the likelihood of IBD regression. However, other
      dietary factors affect the microbiota in different ways. Distinguishing cause
      from effect, and characterizing the relative roles of human and microbial genes, 
      diet, age of onset, gender, life style, smoking history, ethnic background,
      environmental exposures, and medications, will require innovative and
      internationally integrated approaches.

PG  - 139-48
LID - 10.3810/hp.2012.02.954 [doi]
AB  - Clostridium difficile has become an increasingly important nosocomial pathogen
      and is one of the most common causes of hospital-acquired diarrhea. The incidence
      of C difficile infection (CDI) is increasing worldwide. Overuse of antibiotics is
      felt to be a major contributing factor leading to the increased incidence of CDI.
      The clinical manifestations of CDI vary from a mild form of the disease to
      fulminant diarrhea, leading to significant patient morbidity and mortality. The
      increasing incidence of CDI has a major impact on increasing health care costs.
      This article will summarize the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical
      manifestations, laboratory diagnosis, and treatment options for CDI, as well as
      infection-control measures for the prevention of CDI.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Up to 75% of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) will have intestinal 
      resection during their life. Most patients will, however, develop postoperative
      recurrence (endoscopic, clinical or surgical). Several medical and surgical
      strategies have been attempted to prevent postoperative recurrence. This review
      evaluates the efficacy of different drug regimens and surgical techniques in the 
      prevention of clinical, endoscopic and surgical postoperative recurrence of CD.
      METHODS: A literature search for randomized controlled trials on medical or
      surgical interventions was performed. The endpoints for efficacy were clinical,
      endoscopic and surgical recurrence. Meta-analyses were performed in case two or
      more RCTs evaluated the same drug or surgical technique. RESULTS: Mesalamine is
      more effective in preventing clinical recurrence than placebo (P=0,012), as well 
      as nitroimidazolic antibiotics at one year follow-up (P<0.001) and thiopurines
      (P=0.018). Nitroimidazolic antibiotics are also more effective than placebo in
      preventing endoscopic recurrence (P=0.037), as well as thiopurines (P=0.015) and 
      infliximab (P=0.006). Budenoside, probiotics, Interleukin-10 nor any of the
      different surgical procedures showed any significant difference compared to
      placebo in postoperative recurrence rates of CD. CONCLUSION: Among the different 
      drug regimens and surgical techniques, only thiopurines and nitroimidazolic
      antibiotics are able to reduce postoperative clinical as well as endoscopic
      recurrence of CD. Mesalamine and infliximab also seem to be superior to placebo
      in preventing clinical recurrence and endoscopic recurrence, respectively. There 
      is a paucity of trials evaluating long-term follow-up and prevention of surgical 
      recurrence of CD.

TI  - Effect of probiotics on serum bile acids in patients with ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1804-8
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Evaluation of bile acids (BA) is useful for assessing the
      changes of intestinal flora in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). During
      enterohepatic circulation, the intestinal micro flora cause 7
      alpha-dehydroxylation of cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA),
      yielding deoxycholic acid(DCA) and lithocholic acid, respectively. The aim of the
      present study was to investigate the effects of probiotics in patients with UC by
      examining changes of the serum BA profile. METHODOLOGY: Twenty-seven patients
      were divided into the following 2 groups based on endoscopic findings: Fifteen
      patients with distal UC (dUC group) and 12 patients with pancolitis (pUC group). 
      After treatment with mesalazine or salazosulfapyridine (5-ASA), all patients
      achieved remission. Then they were given 5-ASA plus the probiotic Clostridium
      butyricum Miyairi (3.0 g/day) for 4 weeks. RESULTS: After 4 weeks of probiotic
      treatment, %CDCA was significantly higher and %DCA was significantly lower in the
      pUC group than in the HV group. In contrast, the dUC group showed no significant 
      differences of %CDCA or %DCA from the HV group after 4 weeks. CONCLUSIONS:
      Probiotic therapy restored intestinal flora involved in 7 alpha-dehydroxylation
      in the dUC group, but not in the pUC group.

TI  - Emu Oil: a novel therapeutic for disorders of the gastrointestinal tract?
PG  - 857-61
LID - 10.1111/j.1440-1746.2012.07098.x [doi]
AB  - Gastrointestinal diseases characterized by inflammation, including the
      inflammatory bowel diseases, chemotherapy-induced mucositis and non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drug-induced enteropathy, currently have variably effective
      treatment options, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic approaches.
      Recently, naturally-sourced agents including prebiotics, probiotics,
      plant-extracts and marine-derived oils known to possess anti-inflammatory and
      anti-oxidant properties have been investigated in vitro and in vivo. However,
      animal-derived oils are yet to be extensively tested. Emu Oil is extracted from
      the subcutaneous and retroperitoneal fat of the Emu, a flightless bird native to 
      Australia, and predominantly comprises fatty acids. Despite the limited rigorous 
      scientific studies conducted to date, with largely anecdotal claims, Emu Oil,
      when administered topically and orally, has been shown to possess significant
      anti-inflammatory properties in vivo. These include a CD-1 mouse model of croton 
      oil-induced auricular inflammation, experimentally-induced polyarthritis and
      dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. Recently, Emu Oil has been demonstrated
      to endow partial protection against chemotherapy-induced mucositis, with early
      indications of improved intestinal repair. Emu Oil could therefore form the basis
      of an adjunct to conventional treatment approaches for inflammatory disorders
      affecting the gastrointestinal system.

TI  - Characterization of a probiotic-derived soluble protein which reveals a mechanism
      of preventive and treatment effects of probiotics on intestinal inflammatory
      diseases.
PG  - 25-8
LID - 10.4161/gmic.19245 [doi]
AB  - The beneficial effects of probiotics have been demonstrated in many diseases,
      such as inflammatory bowel disease. The known mechanisms for probiotic action
      include blocking pathogenic bacterial effects, enhancing the innate immunity and 
      decreasing pathogen-induced inflammation, and promoting intestinal epithelial
      cell survival, barrier function, and protective responses. We purified and cloned
      a Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG)-derived soluble protein, p40. This protein
      ameliorated cytokine-induced apoptosis in intestinal epithelial cells through
      activation of the EGF receptor and its down-stream target, Akt. By using special 
      hydrogel beads to protect p40 from degradation, we showed that p40 reduced
      intestinal epithelial apoptosis and preserved barrier function in the colon
      epithelium in an EGF receptor-dependent manner, thereby preventing and treating
      intestinal inflammation in mouse models of colitis. Further works regarding
      structural analysis of p40, regulation of EGF receptor activation and
      immunoregulatory effects by p40 are discussed. These results may provide insights
      into the clinical application of probiotics for intestinal inflammatory
      disorders.

TI  - [New knowledge on the diverticular disease of colon].
PG  - 651-5
AB  - The article is a summary paper aimed at new knowledge, concerning the
      classification, diagnostics, medication and endoscopic treatment of diverticular 
      disease of colon. Briefly mentioned are the issues of functional disorder in the 
      field of diverticulosis--symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease of colon.
      Diverticular bleeding is explained in terms of its pathogenesis and diagnostics. 
      The problem with estimation the ration of diverticular bleedings in the total
      number of bleedings into the lower digestive tract is caused by diverse criteria 
      for selecting patients and two levels of diagnostic of diverticular bleeding
      (definite and presumptive). Attention is paid also to diverticular colitis.
      Synonyms, endoscopic and histological classification are listed. The main
      endoscopic findings represent areas of erythema, which are visible on the mucosa 
      between diverticula. Diverticulitis is seen as the most significant complication 
      and the diagnostics of diverticulitis is discussed in detail. The first
      recommended step in the diagnosis is an urgent abdominal ultrasound; the gold
      standard is a CT examination of the abdomen, in special situations, some other
      imaging methods should be used: MRI, colonoscopy. The article ends with an
      overview of modern therapeutic options in the treatment of diverticular colitis
      and diverticulitis, particularly the use of antibiotics, probiotics, mesalasine
      and antispasmodics. Negative effect of NSAIDs on the course of diverticulitis and
      induction diverticular bleeding is listed.

      after therapy.

AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      characterized by damage of large bowel mucosa and frequent extra-intestinal
      autoimmune comorbidities. The role played in IBD pathogenesis by molecular
      chaperones known to interact with components of the immune system involved in
      inflammation is unclear. We previously demonstrated that mucosal Hsp60 decreases 
      in UC patients treated with conventional therapies (mesalazine, probiotics),
      suggesting that this chaperonin could be a reliable biomarker useful for
      monitoring response to treatment, and that it might play a role in pathogenesis. 
      In the present work we investigated three other heat shock protein/molecular
      chaperones: Hsp10, Hsp70, and Hsp90. We found that the levels of these proteins
      are increased in UC patients at the time of diagnosis and decrease after therapy,
      supporting the notion that these proteins deserve attention in the study of the
      mechanisms that promote the development and maintenance of IBD, and as biomarkers
      of this disease (e.g., to monitor response to treatment at the histological
      level).

TI  - Probiotics as an alternative strategy for prevention and treatment of human
      diseases: a review.
PG  - 79-89
AB  - Probiotics are live microbial food supplements or their components, which have
      been shown to have beneficial effects on human health. Probiotics can be
      bacteria, molds, or yeasts, but most of them fall into the group known as lactic 
      acid bacteria and are normally consumed in the form of yogurt, fermented milk, or
      other fermented foods. Data from clinical trials have shown contrasting effects
      and should be interpreted with caution. A large variety of potential beneficial
      effects have been reported including improvement of intestinal tract health,
      enhancing the immune system, reducing symptoms of lactose intolerance, decreasing
      the prevalence of allergy in susceptible individuals, reducing risk of certain
      cancers, treating colitis, lowering serum cholesterol concentrations, reducing
      blood pressure in hypertensives, and improving female urogenital infections and
      Helicobacter pylori infections. The aim of this article is to present a review of
      the current expanding knowledge of applications of utilizing probiotic
      microorganisms in the prevention and treatment of several diseases.

AB  - A complex set of interactions between the human genes encoding innate protective 
      functions and immune defenses and the environment of the intestinal mucosa with
      its microbiota is currently considered key to the pathogenesis of the chronic
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Probiotics offer a method to potentially alter
      the intestinal microbiome exogenously or may provide an option to deliver
      microbial metabolic products to alter the chronicity of intestinal mucosal
      inflammation characterizing IBD. At present, there is little evidence for the
      benefit of currently used probiotic microbes in Crohn's disease or associated
      conditions affecting extra-intestinal organs. However, clinical practice
      guidelines are now including a probiotic as an option for recurrent and relapsing
      antibiotic sensitive pouchitis and the use of probiotics in mild ulcerative
      colitis is provocative and suggests potential for benefit in select patients but 
      concerns remain about proof from trials.

TI  - Effect of lactobacilli on paracellular permeability in the gut.
PG  - 104-17
LID - 10.3390/nu3010104 [doi]
AB  - Paracellular permeability is determined by the complex structures of junctions
      that are located between the epithelial cells. Already in 1996, it was shown that
      the human probiotic strain Lactobacillus plantarum 299v and the rat-originating
      strain Lactobacillus reuteri R2LC could reduce this permeability in a
      methotrexate-induced colitis model in the rat. Subsequently, many animal models
      and cell culture systems have shown indications that lactobacilli are able to
      counteract increased paracellular permeability evoked by cytokines, chemicals,
      infections, or stress. There have been few human studies focusing on the effect
      of lactobacilli on intestinal paracellular permeability but recently it has been 
      shown that they could influence the tight junctions. More precisely, short-term
      administration of L. plantarum WCSF1 to healthy volunteers increased the
      relocation of occludin and ZO-1 into the tight junction area between duodenal
      epithelial cells.

TI  - Determinants of colonic barrier function in inflammatory bowel disease and
      potential therapeutics.
PG  - 1035-44
LID - 10.1113/jphysiol.2011.224568 [doi]
AB  - Intestinal barrier dysfunction is a main feature of the inflammatory bowel
      diseases (IBD), Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Leak flux diarrhoea and a
      facilitated uptake of noxious antigens are the two consequences resulting from an
      impaired epithelial barrier. Barrier perturbations in IBD comprise alterations in
      epithelial tight junctions (TJ), i.e. a reduced number of horizontal TJ strands
      and an altered TJ protein expression and subcellular distribution. Moreover,
      increased incidence of apoptotic events as well as erosions and ulcerations can
      add to that leakiness. These barrier defects are attributed to enhanced activity 
      of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNFalpha, INFgamma, IL-1beta and IL-13, which 
      are highly expressed in the chronically inflamed intestine. Although the
      aetiology of IBD is far from being clear, chronic inflammation is believed to
      result from an inadequate immune response as a consequence of genetic
      predisposition as well as changes in, and altered responses to, the intestinal
      microbiota. On the other hand, an insufficient mucosal response to bacterial
      stimuli results in an insufficient immune response towards intestinal pathogens. 
      However, detailed characterization of barrier defects offers the opportunity to
      consider and test therapeutic interventions. Beside cytokine antagonists,
      different plant compounds and probiotics have been shown to stabilize the barrier
      function by affecting TJ protein expression and distribution.

TI  - Tumour necrosis factor-alpha expression in segmental colitis associated with
      diverticulosis down-regulates after treatment.
PG  - 365-70
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) expression may be
      increased in segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis (SCAD). Our aim was
      to assess TNF-alpha expression in SCAD in relationship to the treatment. METHODS:
      10 patients affected by severe (type B and D) SCAD were studied (6 males, 4
      females, mean age 60.54 years, range 43-85 years). All patients were treated with
      beclomethasone dipropionate 10 mg/day plus a probiotic preparation VSL#3 for 8
      weeks. At that time, clinical, endoscopic and histological reassessment was
      performed. Controls were 5 patients with active ulcerative colitis (UC). RESULTS:
      After treatment, all SCAD B and no SCAD D patients were in remission. The
      TNF-alpha expression dropped from 42.7% (+/-7.58) to 15.7% (+/-2.6) in SCAD B
      patients (p=0.001), and from 40% (+/-5.9) to 28.6% (+/-5.3) in SCAD D patients
      (p=0.005). In UC patients, the TNF-alpha expression dropped from 45.5% (+/-5.09) 
      to 22.5% (+/-2.5) (p=0.001). Neither SCAD B nor SCAD D patients showed a
      significant difference in TNF-alpha expression compared to UC after treatment.
      Finally, TNF-alpha was significantly overexpressed in SCAD D than in SCAD B at
      the end of treatment (p=0.048). CONCLUSIONS: TNF-alpha expression in SCAD down
      regulates after treatment, and seems to be related to the clinical response to
      therapy. This behaviour, similar to that of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD),
      confirms that this disease should be considered as a subtype of IBD.

AB  - Bacteria play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD), its complications and its symptoms. Antibiotics can decrease tissue
      invasion and eliminate aggressive bacterial species. They are used in IBD to
      treat infective complications and for altering bacterial flora, which may result 
      in specific anti-inflammatory effects. In addition, suppression of bacterial
      metabolic activities or direct effects of antibiotics on intestinal structures
      and functions may result in symptoms which cannot be differentiated from symptoms
      caused by inflammation. Although current clinical trials do not fulfill criteria 
      of evidence-based treatment, a few placebo- or standard treatment-controlled
      studies suggest that metronidazole and ciprofloxacin are effective in Crohn's
      colitis and ileocolitis, perianal fistulae and pouchitis. Administration of
      probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics can restore a predominance of beneficial
      species. However, beneficial effects of probiotics in IBD are modest,
      strain-specific and limited to certain manifestations of disease and duration of 
      use of the probiotic. For probiotics there is reasonable evidence of efficacy in 
      relapse prevention in chronic pouchitis and ulcerative colitis, and suggestive
      evidence for postoperative prevention in pouchitis. Therapeutic manipulation of
      the intestinal flora offers considerable promise for treating IBD, but must be
      supported by large controlled therapeutic trials before widespread clinical
      acceptance. These agents may become a component of treating IBD in combination
      with traditional anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents. Probiotic
      strategies, based on metagenomic or metabonomic analyses, and new classes of
      probiotics might play an important role in the future management of IBD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use among inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) patients is common. We characterised CAM utilisation and
      assessed its impact on medical adherence in the IBD population. AIM: To
      characterise CAM utilisation and assess its impact on medical adherence in the
      IBD population. METHODS: Inflammatory bowel disease patients recruited from an
      out-patient clinic at a tertiary centre were asked to complete a questionnaire on
      CAM utilisation, conventional IBD therapy, demographics and communication with
      their gastroenterologist. Adherence was measured using the self-reported Morisky 
      scale. Demographics, clinical characteristics and self-reported adherence among
      CAM and non-CAM users were compared. RESULTS: We recruited prospectively 380 IBD 
      subjects (57% Crohn's disease; 35% ulcerative colitis, and 8% indeterminate
      colitis). The prevalence of CAM use was 56% and did not significantly vary by
      type of IBD. The most common reason cited for using CAM was ineffectiveness of
      conventional IBD therapy (40%). The most popular form of CAM was probiotics
      (53%). CAM users were younger than non-CAM users at diagnosis (21.2 vs. 26.2, P <
      0.0001) and more likely than non-CAM users to have a University-level education
      or higher (75% vs. 62% P = 0.006). There was no overall difference in adherence
      between CAM and non-CAM users (Morisky score: 1.0 vs. 0.9, P = 0.26).
      CONCLUSIONS: The use of complementary and alternative medicine is widely
      prevalent among IBD patients, and is more frequent among those with experience of
      adverse effects of conventional medications. From this cross-sectional analysis, 
      complementary and alternative medicine use does not appear to be associated with 
      reduced overall adherence to medical therapy.

TI  - Probiotics for maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - CD007443
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD007443.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis is a chronic relapsing disease characterised by
      diffuse mucosal inflammation limited to the colon. Current maintenance treatments
      have multiple adverse events and an effective treatment with minimal adverse
      events is desired. Several studies have demonstrated the importance of intestinal
      flora in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. It has been suggested that
      modifying the bacterial flora with probiotics may attenuate the inflammatory
      process and prevent relapses in ulcerative colitis. OBJECTIVES: The primary
      objectives were to determine the efficacy and safety of probiotics for the
      maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis. SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane
      Central Register of Controlled Tials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1966 to July 2011),
      EMBASE (1974 to July 2011), CINAHL (1982 to July 2011) and the Cochrane
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Functional Bowel Disorders Group Specialised Trial
      Register were searched. Manufacturers of probiotics were contacted to identify
      any unpublished trials. References of trials were also searched for any
      additional trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that
      compared probiotics against placebo or any other intervention for the maintenance
      of remission in ulcerative colitis were eligible for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION
      AND ANALYSIS: Data extraction and assessment of methodological quality of
      included studies were independently performed by two authors. The main outcome
      measure was the occurrence of clinical or endoscopic relapse. MAIN RESULTS: Four 
      studies (n = 587) met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review.
      Three trials compared probiotics to mesalazine and one trial compared probiotics 
      with placebo. The studies ranged in length from 3 to 12 months. The risk of bias 
      was high in two studies due to incomplete outcome data and lack of blinding. The 
      methods used for allocation concealment were unclear for all four studies. There 
      was no statistically significant difference between probiotics and mesalazine for
      maintenance of remission in UC. Relapse was reported in 40.1% of patients in the 
      probiotics group compared to 34.1% of patients in the mesalazine group (3
      studies; 555 patients: OR 1.33; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.90 ; I(2) = 11%). There was no
      statistically significant difference in the incidence of adverse events.
      Twenty-six per cent of patients in the probiotics group experienced at least one 
      adverse event compared to 24% of patients in the mesalazine group (2 studies; 430
      patients OR 1.21; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.84; I(2) =27%). Adverse events reported in the
      mesalazine-controlled studies include diarrhea, mucous secretion, bloody stools, 
      abdominal pain, flatulence and distension, nausea and vomiting and headache. A
      small placebo controlled trial (n = 32) found no statistically significant
      difference in efficacy. Seventy-five per cent of probiotic patients relapsed at
      one year compared to 92% of placebo patients (OR 0.27; 95% CI 0.03 to 2.68).
      Adverse events reported in the placebo-controlled study include flatulence,
      abdominal bloating and pain, changes in faecal consistency, arthralgia,
      sacroiliitis, tiredness, incontinence, stress, oral blisters, eye dryness,
      headache, dizziness, influenza, gastroenteritis, cystitis and pneumonia. AUTHORS'
      CONCLUSIONS: Given the relatively small number of patients in the pooled
      analysis, the small number of events and the high risk and unclear risk of bias
      in the included studies, there is insufficient evidence to make conclusions about
      the efficacy of probiotics for maintenance of remission in UC. There is a lack of
      well-designed RCTs in this area and further research is needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intestinal microbiota manipulation, one of the pathogenetic
      components of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), has become an attractive therapy 
      for ulcerative colitis (UC). AIM: To assess in children with active distal UC the
      effectiveness of Lactobacillus (L) reuteri ATCC 55730 enema on inflammation and
      cytokine expression of rectal mucosa. METHODS: A total of 40 patients (median
      age: 7.2 years range 6-18) with mild to moderate UC were enrolled in a
      prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled study. They received an enema
      solution containing 10(10) CFU of L. reuteri ATCC 55730 or placebo for 8 weeks,
      in addition to oral mesalazine. Clinical endoscopic and histological scores as
      well as rectal mucosal expression levels of IL-10, IL-1beta, TNFalpha and IL-8
      were evaluated at the beginning and at the end of the trial. RESULTS: Thirty-one 
      patients accomplished the trial (17 males, median age 13 year, range 7-18). Mayo 
      score (including clinical and endoscopic features) decreased significantly in the
      L. reuteri group (3.2 +/- 1.3 vs. 8.6 +/- 0.8, P < 0.01) compared with placebo
      (7.1 +/- 1.1 vs. 8.7 +/- 0.7, NS); furthermore, histological score significantly 
      decrease only in the L. reuteri group (0.6 +/- 0.5 vs. 4.5 +/- 0.6, P < 0.01)
      (placebo: 2.9 +/- 0.8 vs. 4.6 +/- 0.6, NS). At the post-trial evaluation of
      cytokine mucosal expression levels, IL-10 significantly increased (P < 0.01)
      whereas IL-1beta, TNFalpha and IL-8 significantly decreased (P < 0.01) only in
      the L. reuteri group. CONCLUSIONS: In children with active distal ulcerative
      colitis, rectal infusion of L. reuteri is effective in improving mucosal
      inflammation and changing mucosal expression levels of some cytokines involved in
      the mechanisms of inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - The potential for probiotic manipulation of the gastrointestinal microbiome.
PG  - 192-201
LID - 10.1016/j.copbio.2011.11.004 [doi]
AB  - Multiple internal and external sites of the healthy human body are colonized by a
      diversity of symbiotic microbes. The microbial assemblages found in the intestine
      represent some of the most dense and diverse of these human-associated
      ecosystems. Unsurprisingly, the enteric microbiome, that is the totality of
      microbes, their combined genomes, and their interactions with the human body, has
      a profound impact on physiological aspects of mammalian function, not least, host
      immune response. Lack of early-life exposure to certain microbes, or shifts in
      the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiome have been linked to the
      development and progression of several intestinal and extra-intestinal diseases, 
      including childhood asthma development and inflammatory bowel disease. Modulating
      microbial exposure through probiotic supplementation represents a long-held
      strategy towards ameliorating disease via intestinal microbial community
      restructuring. This field has experienced somewhat of a resurgence over the past 
      few years, primarily due to the exponential increase in human microbiome studies 
      and a growing appreciation of our dependence on resident microbiota to modulate
      human health. This review aims to review recent regulatory aspects related to
      probiotics in food. It also summarizes what is known to date with respect to
      human gastrointestinal microbiota - the niche which has been most extensively
      studied in the human system - and the evidence for probiotic supplementation as a
      viable therapeutic strategy for modulating this consortium.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The principles of surgical management of inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) continue to evolve with advances in medical therapy, surgical
      technique, and minimally invasive operative technology. The purpose of this
      review is to highlight such advances in colorectal and anorectal surgery for IBD 
      over the last year. RECENT FINDINGS: Treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's 
      disease remains challenging and relies on knowledge of both medical and surgical 
      therapies. Recent data support shorter hospitalization prior to surgical
      intervention in patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis, laparoscopic
      surgical approaches when feasible, and ciprofloxacin as optimal therapy for
      pouchitis, when preventive therapy with probiotics is not successful. SUMMARY:
      The management of IBD remains complex and highly individualized. In severe cases,
      a combination of immunosuppression and surgical therapies may be required.
      However, the associated risks of complications make judgments about optimal
      treatment plans challenging.

      strengthening the gut barrier function and changing the gut microenvironment.
PG  - e27961
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0027961 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotic bacteria can be used for the prevention and treatment of
      human inflammatory diseases including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). However,
      the nature of active components and exact mechanisms of this beneficial effects
      have not been fully elucidated. Our aim was to investigate if lysate of probiotic
      bacterium L. casei DN-114 001 (Lc) could decrease the severity of intestinal
      inflammation in a murine model of IBD. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The
      preventive effect of oral administration of Lc significantly reduces the severity
      of acute dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis in BALB/c but not in SCID mice. In 
      order to analyze how this beneficial effect interferes with well-known phases of 
      intestinal inflammation pathogenesis in vivo and in vitro, we evaluated
      intestinal permeability using the FITC-labeled dextran method and analysed tight 
      junction proteins expression by immunofluorescence and PCR. We also measured
      CD4(+)FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells proportion by FACS analysis, microbiota
      composition by pyrosequencing, and local cytokine production by ELISA. Lc leads
      to a significant protection against increased intestinal permeability and barrier
      dysfunction shown by preserved ZO-1 expression. We found that the Lc treatment
      increases the numbers of CD4(+)FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells in mesenteric lymph
      nodes (MLN), decreases production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and
      IFN-gamma, and anti-inflammatory IL-10 in Peyer's patches and large intestine,
      and changes the gut microbiota composition. Moreover, Lc treatment prevents
      lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF-alpha expression in RAW 264.7 cell line by
      down-regulating the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our
      study provided evidence that even non-living probiotic bacteria can prevent the
      development of severe forms of intestinal inflammation by strengthening the
      integrity of intestinal barrier and modulation of gut microenvironment.

TI  - Probiotics in the management of gastrointestinal disease: analysis of the
      attitudes and prescribing practices of gastroenterologists and surgeons.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Probiotics are increasingly advocated in the management of various
      gastrointestinal disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the current 
      attitudes and prescribing practices of surgeons and gastroenterologists for
      probiotics in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. METHODS: A
      questionnaire was designed to look at the frequency of probiotic prescribing,
      types of probiotics used, indications for and duration of treatment and
      clinicians' experiences with probiotic use. A total of 220 questionnaires were
      mailed to consultant gastroenterologists and surgeons practicing in the UK.
      RESULTS: The overall response rate was 80.5%, of which 69.5% of respondents said 
      they recommended or prescribed probiotic food supplements to their patients,
      including 53.4% of surgeons and 80.8% of gastroenterologists (P = 0.00013). The
      most popular probiotic supplements among surgeons were probiotic-containing
      yoghurt and drinks (79.5% and 71.8%, respectively), whereas VSL#3 was more
      popular with gastroenterologists (83.3%). The most popular indications were
      irritable bowel syndrome (70.7% of prescribers) and pouchitis (67.5% of
      prescribers). Many respondents prescribed long-term probiotics. Most consultants 
      had been prescribing probiotics for a period of 1 to 5 years. CONCLUSION:
      Probiotics are popular among gastroenterologists and surgeons in the UK for the
      treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. Further evidence to support their
      routine use, by way of large, well-designed randomized controlled trials, is
      necessary.

TI  - VSL#3 probiotics regulate the intestinal epithelial barrier in vivo and in vitro 
      via the p38 and ERK signaling pathways.
PG  - 202-8

AB  - Probiotics can play a role in enhancing intestinal barrier function. However, the
      underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. The aim of this study was to
      examine the effects of VSL#3 probiotics on colonic epithelium permeability, tight
      junction protein expression and MAPKs signaling pathways in vivo and in vitro. In
      vivo, acute colitis was induced by administration of 3.5% dextran sodium sulfate 
      for 7 days. Rats in two groups were treated with either 15 mg VSL#3 or placebo
      via a gastric tube once daily after induction of colitis. Tight junction protein 
      expression and the MAPKs signaling pathways were studied by immunohistochemistry 
      and immunoblotting. In vitro, HT-29 cells were exposed to TNF-alpha for up to 48 
      h with or without pre-treatment with a p38 MAPK inhibitor, an ERK inhibitor or a 
      JNK inhibitor. Then tight junction proteins and the phosphorylation of MAPKs were
      examined in the presence or absence of VSL#3. In vivo, VSL#3 probiotics
      significantly ameliorated the disease activity index from Day 4 onward. In acute 
      colitis rats, decreased expression of the tight junction proteins were observed, 
      whereas VSL#3 therapy prevented these changes and increased the expression of
      phosphorylated p38 (P-p38), and of phosphorylated ERK (P-ERK). In vitro, tight
      junction proteins, P-p38 and P-ERK in the VSL#3 group were significantly higher
      than in the control and TNF-alpha groups. The p38 MAPK inhibitor and the ERK
      inhibitor could effectively prevent this effect. VSL#3 probiotics protected the
      epithelial barrier and increased the tight junction protein expression in vivo
      and in vitro by activating the p38 and ERK signaling pathways.

PG  - 5-10
LID - 10.1016/j.tim.2011.09.004 [doi]
AB  - Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) mutants of lactobacilli suppress inflammation in animal
      models of experimental colitis. The fact that a single mutation of an
      administered Lactobacillus strain can result in enhanced probiotic efficacy is
      surprising given the genetic diversity and complexity of the intestinal niche,
      but at the same time exciting from a microbiological, immunological and
      gastroenterological point of view. In this Opinion article, we discuss the
      possible impacts of LTA modification in probiotic bacteria in the context of the 
      current knowledge regarding the proinflammatory capacity of LTA,
      structure-activity relationships of LTA, intestinal LTA recognition in healthy
      and colitis conditions and anti-inflammatory molecules of lactobacilli.

AB  - Food-grade Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) have been safely consumed for centuries by 
      humans in fermented foods. Thus, they are good candidates to develop novel oral
      vectors, constituting attractive alternatives to attenuated pathogens, for
      mucosal delivery strategies. Herein, this review summarizes our research, up
      until now, on the use of LAB as mucosal delivery vectors for therapeutic proteins
      and DNA vaccines. Most of our work has been based on the model LAB Lactococcus
      lactis, for which we have developed efficient genetic tools, including expression
      signals and host strains, for the heterologous expression of therapeutic proteins
      such as antigens, cytokines and enzymes. Resulting recombinant lactococci strains
      have been tested successfully for their prophylactic and therapeutic effects in
      different animal models: i) against human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16)-induced
      tumors in mice, ii) to partially prevent a bovine beta-lactoglobulin
      (BLG)-allergic reaction in mice and iii) to regulate body weight and food
      consumption in obese mice. Strikingly, all of these tools have been successfully 
      transposed to the Lactobacillus genus, in recent years, within our laboratory.
      Notably, anti-oxidative Lactobacillus casei strains were constructed and tested
      in two chemically-induced colitis models. In parallel, we also developed a
      strategy based on the use of L. lactis to deliver DNA at the mucosal level, and
      were able to show that L. lactis is able to modulate the host response through
      DNA delivery. Today, we consider that all of our consistent data, together with
      those obtained by other groups, demonstrate and reinforce the interest of using
      LAB, particularly lactococci and lactobacilli strains, to develop novel
      therapeutic protein mucosal delivery vectors which should be tested now in human 
      clinical trials.

AB  - Many different kinds of fermented food are consumed daily in Taiwan, such as
      stinky tofu, suan-tsai, and fu-tsai. We have previously reported the diversity of
      lactic acid bacteria (LAB) at different stages of fermentation in the production 
      of suan-tsai and fu-tsai. In this study, the anti-inflammatory and
      immunomodulatory activities of Lactobacillus plantarum K68 (K68) isolated from
      fu-tsai were evaluated. K68 significantly inhibited the production of tumor
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) in
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cells and stimulated
      interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production in human peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells (hPBMCs). Additionally, orally administered K68 ameliorated dextran sulfate
      sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis (UC) in BALB/c mice. Both the disease
      activity index (DAI) and histological scores (HIS) showed that the severity of UC
      was significantly reduced by oral administration of K68. Furthermore, the
      production of pro inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta),
      and interleukin-6 (IL-6) was significantly reduced in K68-administered group.
      Colonic mRNA expression levels of TNF-alpha, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), forkhead
      box P3 (Foxp3), suppressors of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), and toll like
      receptor 4 (TLR4), were also reduced in the K68-administered group. These results
      suggest that K68 exhibits anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities that 
      ameliorate DSS-induced experimental colitis.

AB  - Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis after ileal pouch anal
      anastomosis in ulcerative colitis patients are often refractory to standard
      therapy. Over the last decade, the rational to use probiotics and its beneficial 
      efficacy in the treatment of chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is
      increasingly under scrutiny. Although it has become clear that intestinal
      epithelial-mucosal immune interactions and enteric bacteria play a critical role 
      in the development of IBD, the substantial clinical efficacy of probiotics in
      these disorders is less evident. This review outlines the clinical studies
      regarding probiotics before October 2007. These studies formed the foundation of 
      probiotic clinical trials in IBD, but they also indicated the need of larger and 
      better-controlled studies than the past experimental approaches. Furthermore,
      this review also examines in-depth the probiotic clinical trials published
      between 2007 and December 2010, providing new insights into the role of
      probiotics for inducing and maintaining remission of IBD, and highlighting some
      of the breakthroughs, especially regarding induction of remission for ulcerative 
      colitis.

      for gut-brain communication.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The probiotic Bifidobacterium longum NCC3001 normalizes anxiety-like 
      behavior and hippocampal brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in mice with
      infectious colitis. Using a model of chemical colitis we test whether the
      anxiolytic effect of B. longum involves vagal integrity, and changes in neural
      cell function. Methods Mice received dextran sodium sulfate (DSS, 3%) in drinking
      water during three 1-week cycles. Bifidobacterium longum or placebo were gavaged 
      daily during the last cycle. Some mice underwent subdiaphragmatic vagotomy.
      Behavior was assessed by step-down test, inflammation by myeloperoxidase (MPO)
      activity and histology. BDNF mRNA was measured in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells
      after incubation with sera from B. longum- or placebo-treated mice. The effect of
      B. longum on myenteric neuron excitability was measured using intracellular
      microelectrodes. KEY RESULTS: Chronic colitis was associated with anxiety-like
      behavior, which was absent in previously vagotomized mice. B. longum normalized
      behavior but had no effect on MPO activity or histological scores. Its anxiolytic
      effect was absent in mice with established anxiety that were vagotomized before
      the third DSS cycle. B. longum metabolites did not affect BDNF mRNA expression in
      SH-SY5Y cells but decreased excitability of enteric neurons. CONCLUSIONS &
      INFERENCES: In this colitis model, anxiety-like behavior is vagally mediated. The
      anxiolytic effect of B. longum requires vagal integrity but does not involve gut 
      immuno-modulation or production of BDNF by neuronal cells. As B. longum decreases
      excitability of enteric neurons, it may signal to the central nervous system by
      activating vagal pathways at the level of the enteric nervous system.

TI  - From gut microflora imbalance to mycobacteria infection: is there a relationship 
      with chronic intestinal inflammatory diseases?
PG  - 361-8
AB  - The gut of a healthy adult harbours a myriad of different microbial species. It
      is estimated that approximately 10 14 are present in total bacterial colony
      forming units (CFU). Each colony colonizes a specific intestinal tract. In
      healthy adult, the main control of intestinal bacterial colonization occurs
      through gastric acidity but also other factors can influence the intestinal
      microenvironment such as pH, temperature, competition among different bacterial
      strains, peristalsis, drugs, radiotherapy and much more. Impaired microbial
      homeostasis leads to an alteration of the permeability of tissue, together with
      the activation of the intestinal immune system MALT (mucosal associated lymphoid 
      tissue). In this regard we discuss the increasing experimental evidences of the
      role of commensal microbiota in the activation of specific intestinal
      immunocompetent cells. The aforementioned micro-environmental changes provide the
      substrate for the etiopathogenetic outbreak of numerous pathologies of
      gastro-intestinal tract, such as intestinal chronic inflammation (Crohn's disease
      and Ulcerative Colitis), together with a miscellany of extra intestinal
      disorders. This article is an overview of the latest scientific findings about
      the close causal relationship between intestinal microbial flora and inflammatory
      bowel diseases or other extra-intestinal diseases; it is also mentioned the
      possible relationship between mycobacteria and Chron's disease. Finally we
      analyse the beneficial role of probiotics.

TI  - Intestinal dendritic cells in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 3761-75

AB  - The gastrointestinal tract harbors a large number and diverse array of commensal 
      bacteria and is an important entry site for pathogens. For these reasons, the
      intestinal immune system is uniquely dedicated to protect against infections,
      while avoiding the development of destructive inflammatory responses to the
      microbiota. Several models have been proposed to explain how the immune system
      discriminates between, and appropriately responds to, commensal and pathogenic
      microorganisms. Dendritic cells (DCs) and regulatory T cells (Treg) are
      instrumental in maintaining immune homeostasis and tolerance in the gut. DCs are 
      virtually omnipresent and are remarkably plastic, having the ability to adapt to 
      the influences of the microenvironment. Different DC populations with partially
      overlapping phenotypic and functional properties have been described in different
      anatomical locations. DCs in the draining mesenteric lymph nodes, in the
      intestinal lamina propria and in Peyer's patches partake both in the control of
      intestinal inflammation and in the maintenance of gut tolerance. In this respect,
      gut-resident DCs and macrophages exert tolerogenic functions as they regularly
      encounter and sense commensal bacteria. In contrast, migrating DC subsets that
      are recruited to the gut as a result of pathogenic insults initiate immune
      responses. Importantly, tolerogenic DCs act by promoting the differentiation and 
      expansion of Treg cells that efficiently modulate gut inflammation, as shown both
      in pre-clinical models of colitis and in patients with inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD). This article reviews the phenotypic and functional features of gut DC
      subsets and discusses the current evidence underpinning the DC contribution to
      the pathogenesis of the major clinical subtypes of human IBD. It also addresses
      the potential clinical benefit derived from DC targeting either in vivo or in
      vitro.

TI  - Heat-killed body of lactobacillus brevis SBC8803 ameliorates intestinal injury in
      a murine model of colitis by enhancing the intestinal barrier function.
PG  - 2235-50
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21597 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics have been clinically administered to improve intestinal
      damage in some intestinal inflammations. However, probiotic treatments are not
      always effective for these intestinal disorders because live bacteria must
      colonize and maintain their activity under unfavorable conditions in the
      intestinal lumen when displaying their functions. This study investigated the
      physiological functions of a heat-killed body of a novel probiotic, Lactobacillus
      brevis SBC8803, on the protection of intestinal tissues, the regulation of
      cytokine production, the improvement of intestinal injury, and the survival rate 
      of mice with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. METHODS: Heat shock
      protein (Hsp) induction and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
      phosphorylation in intestinal epithelia by heat-killed L. brevis SBC8803 were
      examined by Western blotting. The barrier function of intestinal epithelia was
      measured with [(3) H]-mannitol flux in the small intestine under oxidant stress. 
      The effects of the bacteria on improving epithelial injury and cumulative
      survival rate were investigated with a DSS colitis model. RESULTS: Heat-killed L.
      brevis SBC8803 induced Hsps, phosphorylated p38 MAPK, regulated the expression of
      tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-12, and
      improved the barrier function of intestinal epithelia under oxidant stress. The
      induction of Hsp and the protective effect were negated by p38 MAPK inhibitor.
      These functions relieve intestinal impairments and improve the survival rate in
      mice with lethal colitis. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of heat-killed L.
      brevis SBC8803 helps to successfully maintain intestinal homeostasis, while also 
      curing intestinal inflammation. A therapeutic strategy using heat-killed bacteria
      is expected to be beneficial for human health even in conditions unsuitable for
      live probiotics because the heat-killed body is able to exhibit its effects
      without the requirement of colonization.

PG  - G1083-92

AB  - Saccharomyces boulardii (Sb) is a probiotic yeast that has demonstrated efficacy 
      in pilot studies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Microbial
      antigen handling by dendritic cells (DC) is believed to be of critical importance
      for immunity and tolerance in IBD. The aim was to characterize the effects of Sb 
      on DC from IBD patients. Highly purified (>95%), lipopolysaccharide-stimulated
      CD1c(+)CD11c(+)CD123(-) myeloid DC (mDC) from patients with ulcerative colitis
      (UC; n = 36), Crohn's disease (CD; n = 26), or infectious controls (IC; n = 4)
      were cultured in the presence or absence of fungal supernatant from Sb (SbS).
      Phenotype and cytokine production and/or secretion of IBD mDC were measured by
      flow cytometry and cytometric bead arrays, respectively. T cell phenotype and
      proliferation were assessed in a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) with allogenic
      CD4(+)CD45RA(+) naive T cells from healthy donors. Mucosal healing was
      investigated in epithelial wounding and migration assays with IEC-6 cells. SbS
      significantly decreased the frequency of CD40-, CD80-, and CD197 (CCR7; chemokine
      receptor-7)-expressing IBD mDC and reduced their secretion of tumor necrosis
      factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 while increasing IL-8. In the MLR, SbS 
      significantly inhibited T cell proliferation induced by IBD mDC. Moreover, SbS
      inhibited T(H)1 (TNF-alpha and interferon-gamma) polarization induced by UC mDC
      and promoted IL-8 and transforming growth factor-beta-dependent mucosal healing. 
      In summary, we provide novel evidence of synergistic mechanisms how Sb controls
      inflammation (inhibition of T cell costimulation and inflammation-associated
      migration and mobilization of DC) and promotes epithelial restitution relevant in
      IBD.

AB  - Probiotics exhibit beneficial effects on human health, particularly in the
      maintenance of intestinal homeostasis in a complex manner notwithstanding the
      diversity of an intestinal flora between individuals. Thus, it is highly probable
      that some common molecules secreted by probiotic and/or commensal bacteria
      contribute to the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis and protect the
      intestinal epithelium from injurious stimuli. To address this question, we aimed 
      to isolate the cytoprotective compound from a lactobacillus strain, Lactobacillus
      brevis SBC8803 which possess the ability to induce cytoprotective heat shock
      proteins in mouse small intestine. L. brevis was incubated in MRS broth and the
      supernatant was passed through with a 0.2-microm filter. Caco2/bbe cells were
      treated with the culture supernatant, and HSP27 expression was evaluated by
      Western blotting. HSP27-inducible components were separated by ammonium sulfate
      precipitation, DEAE anion exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and HPLC.
      Finally, we identified that the HSP27-inducible fraction was polyphosphate (poly 
      P), a simple repeated structure of phosphates, which is a common product of
      lactobacilli and other bacteria associated with intestinal microflora without any
      definitive physiological functions. Then, poly P was synthesized by poly
      P-synthesizing enzyme polyphosphate kinase. The synthesized poly P significantly 
      induced HSP27 from Caco2/BBE cells. In addition, Poly P suppressed the
      oxidant-induced intestinal permeability in the mouse small intestine and
      pharmacological inhibitors of p38 MAPK and integrins counteract its protective
      effect. Daily intrarectal administration of poly P (10 microg) improved the
      inflammation grade and survival rate in 4% sodium dextran sulfate-administered
      mice. This study, for the first time, demonstrated that poly P is the molecule
      responsible for maintaining intestinal barrier actions which are mediated through
      the intestinal integrin beta1-p38 MAPK.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0022978 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adipocytes from mesenteric white adipose tissue amplify the
      inflammatory response and participate in inflammation-driven immune dysfunction
      in Crohn's disease by releasing proinflammatory mediators. Peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR)-alpha and -gamma, pregnane x receptor
      (PXR), farnesoid x receptor (FXR) and liver x-receptor (LXR) are ligand-activated
      nuclear receptor that provide counter-regulatory signals to dysregulated immunity
      and modulates adipose tissue. AIMS: To investigate the expression and function of
      nuclear receptors in intestinal and adipose tissues in a rodent model of colitis 
      and mesenteric fat from Crohn's patients and to investigate their modulation by
      probiotics. METHODS: Colitis was induced by TNBS administration. Mice were
      administered vehicle or VSL#3, daily for 10 days. Abdominal fat explants obtained
      at surgery from five Crohn's disease patients and five patients with colon cancer
      were cultured with VSL#3 medium. RESULTS: Probiotic administration attenuated
      development of signs and symptoms of colitis, reduced colonic expression of
      TNFalpha, IL-6 and IFNgamma and reserved colonic downregulation of PPARgamma, PXR
      and FXR caused by TNBS. Mesenteric fat depots isolated from TNBS-treated animals 
      had increased expression of inflammatory mediators along with PPARgamma, FXR,
      leptin and adiponectin. These changes were prevented by VSL#3. Creeping fat and
      mesenteric adipose tissue from Crohn's patients showed a differential expression 
      of PPARgamma and FXR with both tissue expressing high levels of leptin. Exposure 
      of these tissues to VSL#3 medium abrogates leptin release. CONCLUSIONS:
      Mesenteric adipose tissue from rodent colitis and Crohn's disease is
      metabolically active and shows inflammation-driven regulation of PPARgamma, FXR
      and leptin. Probiotics correct the inflammation-driven metabolic dysfunction.

      mouse model of experimental colitis.

AB  - Studies showed that specific probiotics provide therapeutic benefits in
      inflammatory bowel disease. In vitro evidence suggested that Lactobacillus
      paracasei also called ST11 (CNCM I-2116) is a potent strain with immune
      modulation properties. However, little is known about its capacity to alleviate
      inflammatory symptoms in vivo In this context, the main objective of this study
      was to investigate the role of ST11 on intestinal inflammation using the adoptive
      transfer mouse model of experimental colitis. Rag2(-/-) recipient mice were fed
      with ST11 (10(9) CFU/day)a month prior toinduce colitis by adoptive transfer of
      naive T cells. One month later, in clear contrast to nonfed mice, weight loss was
      significantly reduced by 50% in ST11-fed mice. Further analysis of colon
      specimens revealed a significant reduction neutrophil infiltration and mucosal
      expression of IL1beta, IL-6, and IL12 proinflammatory cytokines, whereas no
      consistent differences in expression of antibacterial peptides or tight junction 
      proteins were observed between PBS and ST11-fed mice. All together, our results
      demonstrate that oral administration of ST11 was safe and had a significant
      preventive effect on colitis. We conclude that probiotics such as Lactobacillus
      paracasei harbor worthwhile in vivo immunomodulatory properties to prevent
      intestinal inflammation by nutritional approaches.

AB  - Complex and highly variable site-dependent bacterial ecosystems exist throughout 
      the length of the human gastrointestinal tract. Until relatively recently, the
      majority of our information on intestinal microbiotas has come from studies on
      feces, or from aspirates taken from the upper gut. However, there is evidence
      showing that mucosal bacteria growing in biofilms on surfaces lining the gut
      differ from luminal populations, and that due to their proximity to the
      epithelial surface, these organisms may be important in modulating the host's
      immune system and contributing to some chronic inflammatory diseases. Over the
      past decade, increasing interest in mucosal bacteria, coupled with advances in
      molecular approaches for assessing microbial diversity, has begun to provide some
      insight into the complexity of these mucosa-associated communities. In
      gastrointestinal conditions such as inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative
      colitis, Crohn's disease), it has been shown that a dysbiosis exists in microbial
      community structure, and that there is a reduction in putatively protective
      mucosal organisms such as bifidobacteria. Therefore, manipulation of mucosal
      communities may be beneficial in restoring normal functionality in the gut,
      thereby improving the immune status and general health of the host. Biofilm
      structure and function has been studied intensively in the oral cavity, and as a 
      consequence, mucosal communities in the mouth will not be covered in this
      chapter. This review addresses our current knowledge of mucosal populations in
      the gastrointestinal tract, changes that can occur in community structure in
      disease, and therapeutic modulation of biofilm composition by antibiotics,
      prebiotics, and probiotics.

PG  - 1441-53
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201100139 [doi]
AB  - In inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), it is known that besides genetic and
      environmental factors (e.g. diet, drugs, stress), the microbiota play an
      important role in the pathogenesis. Patients with IBD have an altered microbiota 
      (dysbiosis) and therefore, probiotics, defined as 'live micro-organisms that when
      administered in adequate amounts can confer a health benefit on the host', have
      been suggested as nutritional supplements to restore these imbalances. The best
      response on probiotics among the different types of IBD appears to be in the case
      of ulcerative colitis. Although probiotics show promise in IBD in both clinical
      and animal studies, further mechanistic studies are necessary to optimize the use
      of probiotics as supporting therapy in IBD. Murine models of experimental colitis
      have been used for decades to study this pathology, and these models have been
      proven useful to search for new therapeutic approaches. The purpose of this
      review is to summarize probiotic-host interaction studies in murine models of
      experimental colitis and to evaluate how these models can further help in
      understanding these complex interactions. Unraveling the molecular mechanisms
      behind the beneficial effects will assist in better and possibly more efficient
      probiotic formulations.

      following terms: pouchitis, Crohn's, ulcerative colitis, diagnosis, prophylaxis, 
      and treatment. Bibliographies from key articles were also searched, and all
      pertinent articles were reviewed. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All
      available primary literature published in English on treatment for pouchitis was 
      considered, with controlled trials receiving highest priority. DATA SYNTHESIS:
      Pouchitis occurs in up to 50% of ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) patients
      with inflammatory bowel disease within 10 years of the procedure. Symptoms
      include abdominal pain, bloating, and fecal incontinence with frequent diarrhea. 
      The diagnosis of pouchitis is usually made based on symptoms as well as
      endoscopic and histologic findings. Treatment of acute pouchitis includes
      antimicrobials such as ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and rifaximin. If these
      fail, limited data suggest that oral budesonide, mesalamine, or infliximab may be
      effective treatments. Surgical revision may be necessary if medical treatments
      fail. Emerging evidence suggests that the probiotic compound VSL#3 may be
      effective in preventing the recurrence of pouchitis. CONCLUSIONS: Pouchitis is a 
      common complication of IPAA surgery. The strongest data suggest that
      antimicrobial therapy is an effective first-line treatment for acute pouchitis,
      and VSL#3 may be effective for prevention of recurrence.

TI  - Best strategies in recurrent or persistent Clostridium difficile infection.
PG  - 235-9
LID - 10.1089/sur.2010.080 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the primary cause of
      antibiotic-associated colitis and 15-25% of nosocomial antibiotic-associated
      diarrhea. Its clinical manifestations can range from mild diarrhea to toxic
      megacolon, bowel perforation, septic shock, and death. Over the past decade, more
      virulent strains have become increasingly common causes, and the incidence of CDI
      has risen, especially in elderly patients. These developments have led to an
      increase in recurrent CDI, which is more difficult to treat. This review focuses 
      on recurrent CDI and its treatment. METHODS: MEDLINE review using search terms
      Clostridium difficile, Clostridium difficile infection, recurrent Clostridium
      difficile infection. RESULTS: A first recurrence may be treated with the same
      regimen as the first episode. Metronidazole 500 mg q 8 h for 10-14 days is the
      drug of choice for moderate infection, and vancomycin 125 mg q 6 h for 10-14 days
      is the drug of choice for severe CDI. Metronidazole should not be used for
      treatment of subsequent recurrences because of potential neurotoxicity and
      hepatic toxicity. Second recurrences should be treated with an oral vancomycin
      course and taper: 125 mg q 6 h x 10-14 days, 125 mg q 12 h x 7 days, 125 mg q 24 
      h x 7 days, 125 mg q 48-72 h x 2-8 weeks. Alternative agents are fecal
      bacteriotherapy, a "rifaximin chaser," nitazoxanide, probiotics, and intravenous 
      immunoglobulin. Fidaxomicin has been approved recently. Monoclonal antibodies
      against C. difficile toxin remain investigational. CONCLUSION: Treatment of
      recurrent CDI remains challenging. Because of the lack of high-quality studies,
      recommendations for treatment are based on expert opinion. Metronidazole and
      vancomycin are the mainstays of treatment for both the initial infection and the 
      first recurrence. For second recurrences, a vancomycin course plus taper is
      recommended. For subsequent recurrences, treatment options are many, with no one 
      approach being entirely satisfactory. New drugs (fidaximicin) and treatments
      (monoclonal antibodies against the causative toxin) appear promising.

PG  - 820-6
LID - 10.1055/s-0031-1273276 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with ulcerative colitis experience various impairments. The 
      pharmacological treatment of the disease comprises 5-aminosalicylic acid,
      corticosteroids as well as immunomodulatory and biological agents. Little
      self-reported data exist on the prescription of these drugs. METHODS: This
      cross-sectional study was conducted in 2005 as a postal survey in different
      regions of Germany [Kiel/Lubeck, Halle (Saale), Minden, Regensburg]. Patients
      with ulcerative colitis (UC) were recruited from specialised gastroenterological 
      practices, university outpatient clinics, and the member registry of a prominent 
      patient organisation (DCCV). Participants returned a questionnaire including
      established items and scales on physical and psychosocial well-being as well as
      the self-reported current medication. RESULTS: A total of 444 patients with
      ulcerative colitis returned the questionnaires. Most of the participants were
      female, had a high level of school education and were currently employed.
      Twenty-eight percent of the participants reported to receive corticosteroids and 
      71 % reported a current treatment with 5-aminosalicylic acid. Approximately one
      quarter of our study population reported a treatment with immunomodulatory
      agents. Analgesics were reported to be prescribed only in 15 % of the patients,
      primarily in patients with depressive symptoms. Patients recruited from
      specialised gastroenterological practices and university outpatient clinics were 
      more likely to report the prescription of 5-aminosalicylic acid and
      immunomodulatory drugs than members of the patient organisation. Only 7 % of our 
      patients received loperamide, however, probiotics (12 %) and complementary agents
      (36 %) seem to have an important role with regard to prevalence of intake. About 
      40 % of women but only 28 % of the men reported to use complementary agents.
      Persons with a duration of illness of less than 11 years (median split) were
      almost twice as likely to take corticosteroids than persons with a longer
      duration of ulcerative colitis. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest an estimation of 
      prescription rates in ulcerative colitis. However, they raise new questions, for 
      example, concerning a potential underuse of immunomodulatory agents in this
      patient population. With regard to the identified differences in prescription
      rates according to psychosocial characteristics further studies are needed to
      examine these relationships.

AB  - The human gastrointestinal tract harbors a complex and abundant microbial
      community reaching as high as 10(13)-10(14) microorganisms in the colon. This
      endogenous microbiota forms a symbiotic relationship with their eukaryotic host
      and this close partnership helps maintain homeostasis by performing essential and
      non-redundant tasks (e.g. nutrition/energy and, immune system balance, pathogen
      exclusion). Although this relationship is essential and beneficial to the host,
      various events (e.g. infection, diet, stress, inflammation) may impact microbial 
      composition, leading to the formation of a dysbiotic microbiota, further
      impacting on health and disease states. For example, Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis, collectively termed inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), have
      been associated with the establishment of a dysbiotic microbiota. In addition,
      extra-intestinal disorders such as obesity and metabolic syndrome are also
      associated with the development of a dysbiotic microbiota. Consequently, there is
      an increasing interest in harnessing the power of the microbiome and modulating
      its composition as a means to alleviate intestinal pathologies/disorders and
      maintain health status. In this review, we will discuss the emerging relationship
      between the microbiota and development of colorectal cancer as well as present
      evidence that microbial manipulation (probiotic, prebiotic) impacts disease
      development.

TI  - How patients view probiotics: findings from a multicenter study of patients with 
      inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 138-44
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0b013e318225f545 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) have access to a growing number of probiotic products marketed to 
      improve digestive health. It is unclear how patients make decisions about
      probiotics and what role they expect their gastroenterologists to play as they
      consider using probiotics. Understanding patients' knowledge, attitudes and
      expectations of probiotics may help gastroenterologists engage patients in
      collaborative discussions about probiotics. STUDY: Focus groups were conducted
      with patients with IBD and IBS at the Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic, and Johns
      Hopkins University. Inductive analytic methods were used to identify common
      themes and draw interpretations from focus group narratives. RESULTS: One hundred
      thirty-six patients participated in 22 focus groups between March and August
      2009. Patients viewed probiotics as an appealing alternative to pharmaceutical
      drugs and understood probiotics as a more "natural," low-risk therapeutic option.
      Many patients were hesitant to use them without consulting their
      gastroenterologists. Patients would weigh the risks and benefits of probiotics,
      their disease severity and satisfaction with current treatments when considering 
      probiotic use. CONCLUSIONS: Patients are interested in probiotics but have many
      unanswered questions about their use. Our findings suggest that patients with IBD
      and IBS will look to gastroenterologists and other clinicians as trustworthy
      advisors regarding the utility of probiotics as an alternative or supplement to
      pharmaceutical drugs. Gastroenterologists and other clinicians who care for
      patients with these diseases should be prepared to discuss the potential benefits
      and risks of probiotics and assist patients in making informed decisions about
      their use.

PG  - 1617-25
LID - 10.1099/jmm.0.033423-0 [doi]
AB  - In contrast to most modern pharmaceuticals, probiotics are used in many parts of 
      the world with little or no research data on the complex system of interactions
      that each strain may elicit in the human body. Research on probiotics has
      recently become more significant, as probiotics have begun to be prescribed by
      clinicians as an alternative for some gut infections, especially when antibiotics
      are contraindicated. This study attempted to elucidate the inhibitory interaction
      between the Japanese probiotic strain Clostridium butyricum MIYAIRI 588 (CBM588) 
      and the hospital pathogen Clostridium difficile, which is responsible for a large
      proportion of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and colitis. CBM588 has previously 
      shown effectiveness against C. difficile in vivo, and here it was found that the 
      toxicity of C. difficile in in vitro co-culture with CBM588 was greatly decreased
      or absent. This was dependent on the inoculation ratio and was not accounted for 
      by the small degree of growth and mRNA inhibition observed. CBM588 and its
      cell-free supernatant also had no effect on toxin already secreted into the
      culture medium, and culture of the two strains separated by a semi-permeable
      membrane resulted in loss of the inhibition. Therefore, it was concluded that the
      detoxification probably occurred by the inhibition of toxin protein production
      and that this required close proximity or contact between the two species. The
      low-pH conditions caused by organic acid secretion were also observed to have

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to better characterise the biological effects 
      of Lactobacillus salivarius ssp. salivarius CECT5713, a probiotic with
      immunomodulatory properties. METHODS: Live or dead probiotic was assayed in the
      TNBS model of rat colitis to determine whether viability was a requisite to exert
      the beneficial effects. In vitro studies were also performed in Caco-2 cells to
      evaluate its effects on epithelial cell recovery and IL-8 production. Finally,
      the probiotic was assayed in the LPS model of septic shock in mice to establish
      its effects when there is an altered systemic immune response. RESULTS: The
      viability of the probiotic was required for its anti-inflammatory activity. The
      probiotic inhibited IL-8 production in stimulated Caco-2 cells and facilitated
      the recovery of damaged intestinal epithelium. In LPS-treated mice, the probiotic
      inhibited the production of TNFalpha in plasma and lungs and increased the
      hepatic glutathione content. These effects were associated with an improvement in
      the altered production of the T-cell cytokines in splenocytes, by reducing IL-2
      and IL-5 and by increasing IL-10. Finally, it reduced the increased plasma IgG
      production in LPS-treated mice. CONCLUSION: The anti-inflammatory effects of
      viable L. salivarius ssp. salivarius CECT5713 are not restricted to the
      gastrointestinal tract.

AB  - The factors involved in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis, the two major types of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are summarized. 
      Intestinal antigens composed of bacterial flora along with antigen presentation
      and impaired mucosal barrier have an important role in the initiation of IBD. The
      bacterial community may be modified by the use of antibiotics and probiotics. The
      dentritic cells recognize the antigens by cell surface Toll like receptor and the
      cytoplasmic CARD/NOD system. The balance between Th1/Th2/Th17 cell populations
      being the source of a variety of cytokines regulates the inflammatory mechanisms 
      and the clearance of microbes. The intracellular killing and digestion, including
      autophagy, are important in the protection against microbes and their toxins. The
      homing process determines the location and distribution of the immune cells along
      the gut. All these players are potential targets of pharmacological manipulation 
      of disease status.

PG  - 403-9
LID - 10.1007/s11655-011-0758-3 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the evidence of the use and efficacy for complementary and
      alternative medicine (CAM) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: A
      systematic literature search in MEDLINE was performed for randomized controlled
      trials (RCTs) in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Moreover, a selective
      literature search for health services research studies on the use of CAM in
      patients with IBD was performed. RESULTS: Health services research studies showed
      a high use of CAM in adult and pediatric patients with IBD worldwide. In contrast
      to the high use among IBD patients, there was a lack of high-quality data for
      many of the used CAM methods. Although most of the studies showed positive
      results, the methodological quality of most studies was rather low; therefore,
      the results had to be interpreted with caution. While there were many studies for
      probiotics and fish oil, RCTs for the highly used method homeopathy, for most
      herbal products, and for traditional Chinese medicine methods apart from
      acupuncture RCTs were completely lacking. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of high-quality
      studies might be the consequence of the problems: associated with the funding of 
      clinical trials involving CAM. However, having the high user rates in mind,
      high-quality studies assessing efficacy and safety of those methods are urgently 
      needed. Furthermore, there is a quality need for better representation of CAM in 
      undergraduate and postgraduate medical education.

AB  - Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) often question their doctors about
      diet. The objectives of this article are to provide clinicians with existing
      dietary advice by presenting the dietary information proposed by medical
      societies in the form of clinical practice guidelines as it relates to IBD;
      listing dietary guidelines from patient-centered IBD-related organizations; and
      creating a new 'global practice guideline' that attempts to consolidate the
      existing information regarding diet and IBD. The dietary suggestions derived from
      sources found in this article include nutritional deficiency screening, avoiding 
      foods that worsen symptoms, eating smaller meals at more frequent intervals,
      drinking adequate fluids, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, taking vitamin/mineral
      supplementation, eliminating dairy if lactose intolerant, limiting excess fat,
      reducing carbohydrates and reducing high-fiber foods during flares. Mixed advice 
      exists regarding probiotics. Enteral nutrition is recommended for Crohn's disease
      patients in Japan, which differs from practices in the USA.

TI  - Functional characterization of MIMP for its adhesion to the intestinal
      epithelium.
PG  - 2106-27
AB  - The micro integral membrane protein (MIMP), the domain within the integral
      membrane protein of Lactobacillus plantarum CGMCC 1258, has been shown to adhere 
      to mucin and antagonize the adhesion of enteroinvasive E. coli and
      enteropathogenic E. coli. To further characterize the functions of MIMP, we
      investigated its effects on the intestinal permeability, expression of tight
      junction (TJ) proteins and TJ ultrastructure in vitro and in vivo. We also
      determined the interaction between MIMP and dendritic cells (DCs). We observed
      that MIMP reduced intestinal permeability and restored the expression and
      distribution of TJ proteins in both NCM460 cell monolayers and in IL-10(-/-)
      mice. MIMP adhered to immature (i) DCs by binding to DC-SIGN, and induced DCs to 
      produce anti-inflammatory cytokines and to mediate Th2 differentiation. Moreover,
      MIMP stimulated the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines in colonic mucosa
      and attenuated colitis in IL-10(-/-) mice. In conclusion, MIMP is the main
      functional component of L. plantarum that contributes to its protective effects, 
      and thus may be a potential therapeutic agent for intestinal diseases.

TI  - Fecal bacteriotherapy for ulcerative colitis: patients are ready, are we?
PG  - 676-84
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21775 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fecal bacteriotherapy (FB) has been proposed as a safe and effective 
      alternative treatment for a number of gastrointestinal conditions including
      ulcerative colitis (UC). We performed a qualitative study to explore the
      attitudes and concerns of adult patients and parents of children with UC
      regarding FB as a potential treatment. METHODS: We conducted six focus groups for
      adult patients with UC and parents of children with UC or indeterminate colitis. 
      Participants were asked about their perceptions of and interest in FB as a
      treatment for UC. Sessions were recorded, transcribed, and reviewed to identify
      domains, themes, and major concepts. RESULTS: The focus groups included 15 adult 
      patients and seven parents of children with colitis. We identified five major
      domains pertaining to FB: impressions of treatment, benefits, risks, potential
      mechanisms, and social concerns. All but one participant expressed interest in FB
      and several wished it were already available. Participants compared FB to
      probiotics, felt it was "natural," easier than current therapies, and with donor 
      screening would be safe. Although initial distaste and the "yuck factor" were
      uniformly mentioned, these concerns were outweighed by perceived benefits.
      CONCLUSION: This is the first study to examine important ethical and social
      issues surrounding FB as a treatment for UC. Given adequate supporting research, 
      donor selection, and screening, adult patients and parents of children with UC
      will consider FB and are eager for it to become available. These findings have
      important implications for future microbiome-based treatments.

TI  - Clinical utility of probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 72-9
AB  - Many patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) use probiotics to manage this
      intestinal condition. Despite widespread use of these natural therapies by
      patients, health care providers may be unfamiliar with probiotics as a treatment 
      modality. This review describes the rationale for use of probiotics in IBD, the
      history behind current research directions, and recent controlled clinical
      studies in which efficacy of probiotics has been explored in patients with IBD.
      Emphasis is placed upon critical analysis of study designs for investigations
      that used lactic acid-producing bacteria or Saccharomyces boulardii in management
      of Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. While there is suggestion of benefit
      when patients with ulcerative colitis use bacterial therapies and when patients
      with Crohn's disease use S boulardii, small sample sizes and methodological flaws
      in study designs necessitate that additional investigations be conducted before
      probiotics can be routinely recommended in clinical practice.

AB  - Preclinical studies with probiotics continue to unravel mechanisms of
      cytoprotection and suggest that approaches utilizing microbial products as
      therapeutics in acute and chronic gastrointestinal disorders could be effective. 
      However, clinical trials using these bacteria have thus far been inconsistent. In
      this issue of the JCI, Yan et al. describe a novel mechanism of cytoprotection by
      p40, a soluble product of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, mediated via EGFR. The
      efficacy of p40 in three models of chemically induced colitis indicates
      tremendous therapeutic potential, though this finding will need to be verified in
      human patients.

LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S11290 [doi]
AB  - During the last decade a large number of biological agents against tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), as well as many biochemical substances and molecules
      specifically for the medical treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD), have been developed. This enormous progress was a consequence of
      the significant advances in biotechnology along with the increased knowledge of
      the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of IBD.
      However, conventional therapies remain the cornerstone of treatment for most
      patients. During recent years conventional and biologic IBD therapies have been
      optimized. Newer mesalazine formulations with a reduced pill size and only one
      dose per day demonstrate similar efficacy to older formulations. New
      corticosteroids retain the efficacy of older corticosteroids while exhibiting a
      higher safety profile. The role of antibiotics and probiotics has been further
      clarified. Significant progress in understanding thiopurine metabolism has
      improved the effective dose along with adjunctive therapies. Quite a large number
      of substances and therapies, including biologic agents other than TNF-alpha
      inhibitors, unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin, omega-3
      polyunsaturated fatty acids, microbes and microbial products, leukocytapheresis, 
      and other substances under investigation, could offer important benefits to our
      patients. In this paper we review the established and emerging therapeutic
      strategies in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

LID - 10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-10-375 [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, two forms of inflammatory bowel disease, 
      are important problems in industrialized countries. The complete etiology of
      these two diseases is still unknown but likely involves genetic, environmental,
      and immunological factors. The aim of the present work was to determine whether
      the anti-inflammatory effects reported for yoghurt in acute trinitrobenzene
      sulfonic acid-induced intestinal inflammation in mice also could prevent or
      attenuate the recurrent intestinal inflammation, thus maintaining remission. The 
      innate response also was evaluated through participation of Toll-like receptors
      (TLRs) and the analysis of T-cell populations to determine the effects of yoghurt
      in an acute inflammatory bowel disease model. Yoghurt exerted a beneficial effect
      on acute intestinal inflammation by regulating T-cell expansion and modulating
      the expression of TLRs, with decrease of TLR4(+) and increase of TLR9(+) cells.
      The anti-inflammatory effect of yoghurt also was demonstrated in a recurrent
      inflammation model. Yoghurt administration during the remission phase prevented
      the recurrence of inflammation without producing undesirable side effects. The
      yoghurt effect may be mediated by increased interleukin 10 production and changes
      in intestinal microbiota.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diverticulitis due to diverticulosis of the colon is a common
      clinical problem with a high morbidity and socio-economic consequences. Frequent 
      clinical signs are flatulence, abdominal pain, stool problems which may often be 
      misinterpreted as the symptoms of an irritable bowel or a colitis. Accordingly,
      the diagnostic work-up must be adequate to allow for the stage-adapted planning
      and performance of the therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The following questions
      will be addressed in this review: What do we need to clarify diagnosis? Which
      antibiotics should be used? What is the best conservative approach for treatment?
      RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Basic conservative therapy consists of systemic
      antibiosis which can be extended by a topical antibiosis, and administration of
      aspirin as well as probiotics. The indications for a specific therapy is made on 
      an individual basis according to stage (Hansen and Stock). Above all, a "team
      approach" and close communication between gastroenterologists and surgeons are
      mandatory for adequate treatment of these patients.

      patients with ulcerative colitis: a randomized controlled study.
PG  - 128-33
LID - 10.1159/000322977 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: In previous studies, we described the beneficial effects of
      bifidobacteria-fermented milk in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Here, we 
      examined the effects of a live Bifidobacterium breve strain Yakult, a probiotic
      contained in bifidobacteria-fermented milk, and galacto-oligosaccharide (GOS) as 
      synbiotics in UC patients. METHODS: Forty-one patients with mild to moderate UC
      were assigned to two groups; one group was treated with the synbiotics and the
      other was not (control). The treatment group ingested 1 g of the probiotic powder
      (10(9) CFU/g) three times a day, and 5.5 g of GOS once a day for one year. At the
      start and the end of this study, colonoscopic index and the amount of
      myeloperoxidase in a lavage solution were used as disease activity indices.
      Bacterial counts in the feces at the start and the end of this study were also
      examined. RESULTS: After a one-year treatment with the synbiotics, the clinical
      status of the UC patients as assessed by colonoscopy, significantly improved.
      Furthermore, the amount of myeloperoxidase in the lavage also decreased in these 
      patients after the synbiotic treatment. The synbiotics significantly reduced the 
      fecal counts of Bacteroidaceae and fecal pH. CONCLUSION: Administration of live
      B. breve strain Yakult and GOS can improve the clinical condition of patients
      with UC. These results encouraged us to perform a large-scale randomized,
      placebo-controlled trial.

PG  - 89-101
LID - 10.1159/000323456 [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis represent distinct phenotypic forms of
      inflammatory bowel disease and continue to be a common cause of morbidity. The
      corticosteroids and the immunomodulatory drugs, which are the basis of treatment 
      for the inflammatory bowel diseases, do not assure always satisfactory outcomes. 
      Nutrition has been used in order to modify the inflammatory response of various
      chronic inflammatory diseases, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. 
      In the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases, the intestinal microflora and
      the intestinal mucosal disorders play a crucial role. Also, the release of
      reactive oxygen species is a significant factor of initiation and preservation of
      the inflammatory reaction in these diseases. The advantages of the nutritional
      treatment derive from the sequestration of intraluminal agents which may promote 
      the inflammatory bowel response or, alternatively, nutrition is able to modify
      the immune response, reducing the uncontrolled inflammatory reaction.
      Furthermore, nutrition can enhance the mucosal barrier function and consists a
      significant source of antioxidants. This review focuses on certain nutritional
      components that modulate the inflammatory response of the bowel and aims to
      present a rational thesis regarding the use of nutritional agents in the
      management of inflammatory bowel diseases.

TI  - Saccharomyces boulardii improves intestinal cell restitution through activation
      of the alpha2beta1 integrin collagen receptor.
PG  - e18427
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0018427 [doi]
AB  - Intestinal epithelial cell damage is frequently seen in the mucosal lesions of
      inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease.
      Complete remission of these diseases requires both the cessation of inflammation 
      and the migration of enterocytes to repair the damaged epithelium. Lyophilized
      Saccharomyces boulardii (Sb, Biocodex) is a nonpathogenic yeast widely used as a 
      therapeutic agent for the treatment and prevention of diarrhea and other
      gastrointestinal disorders. In this study, we determined whether Sb could
      accelerate enterocyte migration. Cell migration was determined in Sb force-fed
      C57BL6J mice and in an in vitro wound model. The impact on alpha2beta1 integrin
      activity was assessed using adhesion assays and the analysis of alpha2beta1
      mediated signaling pathways both in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrated that Sb
      secretes compounds that enhance the migration of enterocytes independently of
      cell proliferation. This enhanced migration was associated with the ability of Sb
      to favor cell-extracellular matrix interaction. Indeed, the yeast activates
      alpha2beta1 integrin collagen receptors. This leads to an increase in tyrosine
      phosphorylation of cytoplasmic molecules, including focal adhesion kinase and
      paxillin, involved in the integrin signaling pathway. These changes are
      associated with the reorganization of focal adhesion structures. In conclusion Sb
      secretes motogenic factors that enhance cell restitution through the dynamic
      regulation of alpha2beta1 integrin activity. This could be of major importance in
      the development of novel therapies targeting diseases characterized by severe
      mucosal injury, such as inflammatory and infectious bowel diseases.

TI  - Is 5-ASA still the treatment of choice for ulcerative colitis?
PG  - 1396-405
AB  - 5-Amino-salacylic acid (5-ASA) is up to now the treatment of choice in the
      induction and maintenance of remission of mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis
      (UC). Sulfasalazine, despite similar efficacy, is hampered by more side effects, 
      but in presence of peripheral arthopaties it remains the treatment of choice. The
      new delayed release MMX formulation seems to be promising in reducing compliance 
      problems, but further studies are warranted to show the superiority of new MMX
      formulation compared with the older formulations of 5-ASA. Some trials evaluated 
      also the efficacy and safety of once-daily dosing of older 5-ASA formulations in 
      maintenance of remission, finding a greater adherence to therapy in the group
      given the once daily regimen, compared with the classic twice daily groups.
      Regarding the efficacy of alternative treatment such us probiotics and
      antibiotics, the current data are not sufficient to promote their use in clinical
      practice. Clinical evidence supports the use of topical 5-ASA in active mild to
      moderate distal UC showing superior ef fi cacy to placebo, topical
      corticosteroids, and oral 5-ASA. A combination of oral and rectal 5-ASA produces 
      additional ef fi cacy in both limited and extensive UC. Topical 5-ASA
      formulations are effective also for the maintenance of remission, however long
      term treatment may not be acceptable to many patients. Other topical drugs (E.
      Coli Nissle, propionyl-L-carnitine, butyrate, tacrolimus, rosiglitazone) have
      been investigated with conflicting results. The possible chemopreventive role of 
      long term treatment with 5-ASA strengthens the indication to the long term use of
      5-ASA.

TI  - How to manage pouchitis in ulcerative colitis?
PG  - 1454-61
AB  - It is estimated that 50% of patients who have undergone ileal pouch-anal
      anastomosis (IPAA) surgery for UC will develop at least one episode of pouchitis.
      The risk of developing pouchitis is much higher in patients with preoperative
      extraintestinal manifestations and primary sclerosing cholangitis. In acute
      pouchtis metronidazole or ciprofloxacin have shown efficacy, however there is
      some evidence that ciprofloxacin may have better and has less toxic. In patients 
      with chronic pouchitis antibiotics are less effective, and maintenance therapy
      may be required. In cases of refractoriness to conventional therapy a combination
      of two antibiotics for a prolonged period or infliximab may be effective.
      Starting maintenance treatment with highly concentrated probiotics is recommended
      as primary and secondary prophylaxis.

TI  - A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial with Lactobacillus acidophilus
      La-5 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 for maintenance of
      remission in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 115-21
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2010.11.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To investigate the clinical effect of treatment with
      Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12
      (Probio-Tec AB-25) to maintain remission in patients with ulcerative colitis.
      METHODS: Patients with left-sided ulcerative colitis in remission - including
      proctitis and at least one relapse within the last year were randomised (2:1) in 
      a double-blind placebo-controlled study to Probio-Tec AB-25 or placebo for 52
      weeks. The patients were evaluated clinically, endoscopically and histologically 
      at entry and if relapsing. No other medication for ulcerative colitis than the
      study drug was allowed during the study. Primary endpoint was maintenance of
      clinical remission, secondary endpoints comparisons of days to relapse, and
      safety and tolerability of the study drug. The concentrations of the probiotic
      bacterial strains in stool were analysed in a subset of patients. RESULTS:
      Thirty-two patients were randomised. Twenty patients received Probio-Tec AB-25
      and twelve patients received placebo. Five patients (25%) in the Probio-Tec AB-25
      group and one patient (8%) in the placebo group maintained remission after 1 year
      of treatment (p=0.37). The median time to relapse was 125.5days (range 11-391
      days) in the probiotic group and 104 days (range 28-369 days) in the placebo
      group respectively, (p=0.683). Probio-Tec AB-25 was overall well tolerated.
      CONCLUSIONS: In this small randomised placebo-controlled trial no significant
      clinical benefit of Probio-Tec AB-25 could be demonstrated in comparison with
      placebo for maintaining remission in patients with left-sided ulcerative colitis.
      A difference may be achieved in larger studies, but the clinical significance of 
      this would be questionable. This study was registered in ClinicalTrial.gov
      (NCT00268164).

TI  - Changes in immunohistochemical levels and subcellular localization after therapy 
      and correlation and colocalization with CD68 suggest a pathogenetic role of Hsp60
      in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 552-61
LID - 10.1097/PAI.0b013e3182118e5f [doi]
AB  - In an earlier work, the role of heat shock protein (Hsp60) in the pathogenesis of
      ulcerative colitis (UC) was suggested by its significant increase in the
      pathological mucosa parallel with an increase in inflammatory cells. More data in
      this direction are reported in this work. We analyzed by immunohistochemistry
      biopsies of colon tissue from 2 groups of patients with UC and treated with
      either 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) alone or in combination with a probiotic. We
      looked for inflammatory markers and Hsp60. Both the treatments were effective in 
      reducing symptoms but the group treated with both 5-ASA and probiotics showed
      better clinical results. Amelioration of symptoms was associated with reduction
      of both inflammation and Hsp60, a reduction that was most marked in the group
      treated with 5-ASA and probiotics. The levels of Hsp60 positively correlated with
      those of CD68-positive cells, and double immunofluorescence showed a high index
      of colocalization of the chaperonin and CD68 in lamina propria. Immunoelectron
      microscopy showed that Hsp60-classically a mitochondrial protein-was abundantly
      also present in cytosol in biopsies taken at the time of diagnosis, but not after
      the treatment. Our data suggest that Hsp60 is an active player in pathogenesis of
      UC and it can be hypothesized that the chaperonin is responsible, at least in
      part, for initiation and maintenance of disease.

TI  - Probiotic sonicates selectively induce mucosal immune cells apoptosis through
      ceramide generation via neutral sphingomyelinase.
PG  - e16953
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0016953 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics appear to be beneficial in inflammatory bowel disease, but
      their mechanism of action is incompletely understood. We investigated whether
      probiotic-derived sphingomyelinase mediates this beneficial effect.
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Neutral sphingomyelinase (NSMase) activity was
      measured in sonicates of the probiotic L. brevis (LB) and S. thermophilus (ST)
      and the non-probiotic E. coli (EC) and E. faecalis (EF). Lamina propria
      mononuclear cells (LPMC) were obtained from patients with Crohn's disease (CD)
      and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from
      healthy volunteers, analysing LPMC and PBMC apoptosis susceptibility, reactive
      oxygen species (ROS) generation and JNK activation. In some experiments,
      sonicates were preincubated with GSH or GW4869, a specific NSMase inhibitor.
      NSMase activity of LB and ST was 10-fold that of EC and EF sonicates. LB and ST
      sonicates induced significantly more apoptosis of CD and UC than control LPMC,
      whereas EC and EF sonicates failed to induce apoptosis. Pre-stimulation with
      anti-CD3/CD28 induced a significant and time-dependent increase in LB-induced
      apoptosis of LPMC and PBMC. Exposure to LB sonicates resulted in JNK activation
      and ROS production by LPMC. NSMase activity of LB sonicates was completely
      abrogated by GW4869, causing a dose-dependent reduction of LB-induced apoptosis. 
      LB and ST selectively induced immune cell apoptosis, an effect dependent on the
      degree of cell activation and mediated by bacterial NSMase. CONCLUSIONS: These
      results suggest that induction of immune cell apoptosis is a mechanism of action 
      of some probiotics, and that NSMase-mediated ceramide generation contributes to
      the therapeutic effects of probiotics.

AB  - Chronic inflammatory diseases, depending upon the duration and severity, are
      frequently associated with an increased risk of developing cancer. A classic
      paradigm is the enhanced risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Carcinogenesis is a multifactorial process that
      involves accumulation of genetic defects, protein modification, and cell-matrix
      interaction. In this review, we discuss aspects of chronic inflammation in IBD
      that influence the development of CRC and highlight the key molecular mediators
      involved in this process. Also, we identify potential targets that could
      facilitate earlier detection of dysplasia. The targeted manipulation of specific 
      molecules or pathways could provide opportunities for the development of
      therapeutic and chemopreventive interventions, which may prove effective in
      arresting the progression of colitis-associated cancer (CAC), with clinical
      implications.

TI  - Upregulation of P-glycoprotein by probiotics in intestinal epithelial cells and
      in the dextran sulfate sodium model of colitis in mice.
PG  - G1115-23
LID - 10.1152/ajpgi.00027.2011 [doi]
AB  - P-glycoprotein (P-gp) mediates efflux of xenobiotics and bacterial toxins from
      the intestinal mucosa into the lumen. Dysregulation of P-gp has been implicated
      in inflammatory bowel disease. Certain probiotics have been shown to be effective
      in treating inflammatory bowel disease. However, direct effects of probiotics on 
      P-gp are not known. Current studies examined the effects of Lactobacilli on P-gp 
      function and expression in intestinal epithelial cells. Caco-2 monolayers and a
      mouse model of dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis were utilized. P-gp
      activity was measured as verapamil-sensitive [(3)H]digoxin transepithelial flux. 
      Multidrug resistant 1 (MDR1)/P-gp expression was measured by real-time
      quantitative PCR and immunoblotting. Culture supernatant (CS; 1:10 or 1:50, 24 h)
      of Lactobacillus acidophilus or Lactobacillus rhamnosus treatment of
      differentiated Caco-2 monolayers (21 days postplating) increased ( approximately 
      3-fold) MDR1/P-gp mRNA and protein levels. L. acidophilus or L. rhamnosus CS
      stimulated P-gp activity ( approximately 2-fold, P < 0.05) via phosphoinositide
      3-kinase and ERK1/2 MAPK pathways. In mice, L. acidophilus or L. rhamnosus
      treatment (3 x 10(9) colony-forming units) increased mdr1a/P-gp mRNA and protein 
      expression in the ileum and colon (2- to 3-fold). In the dextran sulfate sodium
      (DSS)-induced colitis model (3% DSS in drinking water for 7 days), the degree of 
      colitis as judged by histological damage and myeloperoxidase activity was reduced
      by L. acidophilus. L. acidophilus treatment to DSS-treated mice blocked the
      reduced expression of mdr1a/P-gp mRNA and protein in the distal colon. These
      findings suggest that Lactobacilli or their soluble factors stimulate P-gp
      expression and function under normal and inflammatory conditions. These data
      provide insights into a novel mechanism involving P-gp upregulation in beneficial
      effects of probiotics in intestinal inflammatory disorders.

TI  - Lactobacillus bulgaricus OLL1181 activates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor pathway 
      and inhibits colitis.
PG  - 817-22
LID - 10.1038/icb.2010.165 [doi]
AB  - Increasing evidence suggests that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway has
      an important role in the regulation of inflammatory responses. Most recently, we 
      have shown that the activation of the AhR pathway by a potent AhR agonist
      inhibits the development of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis, a model
      of human ulcerative colitis, by the induction of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in the
      large intestine. Because several strains of probiotic lactic acid bacteria have
      been reported to inhibit DSS-induced colitis by unidentified mechanisms, we
      hypothesized that particular strains of lactic acid bacterium might have the
      potential to activate the AhR pathway, thereby inhibiting DSS-induced colitis.
      This study investigated whether there are specific lactic acid bacterial strains 
      that can activate the AhR pathway, and if so, whether this AhR-activating
      potential is associated with suppression of DSS-induced colitis. By using AhR
      signaling reporter cells, we found that Lactobacillus bulgaricus OLL1181 had the 
      potential to activate the AhR pathway. OLL1181 also induced the mRNA expression
      of cytochrome P450 family 1A1 (CYP1A1), a target gene of the AhR pathway, in
      human colon cells, which was inhibited by the addition of an AhR antagonist,
      alpha-naphthoflavon (alphaNF). In addition, mice treated orally with OLL1181
      showed an increase in CYP1A1 mRNA expression in the large intestine and
      amelioration of DSS-induced colitis. Thus, OLL1181 can induce activation of the
      intestinal AhR pathway and inhibit DSS-induced colitis in mice. This strain of
      lactic acid bacterium has therefore the potential to activate the AhR pathway,
      which may be able to suppress colitis.

AB  - AIM: To assess the anti-inflammatory effect of the probiotic Bifidobacterium
      lactis (B. lactis) in an adoptive transfer model of colitis. METHODS: Donor and
      recipient mice received either B. lactis or bacterial culture medium as control
      (deMan Rogosa Sharpe) in drinking water for one week prior to transfer of a mix
      of naive and regulatory T cells until sacrifice. RESULTS: All recipient mice
      developed signs of colonic inflammation, but a significant reduction of weight
      loss was observed in B. lactis-fed recipient mice compared to control mice.
      Moreover, a trend toward a diminution of mucosal thickness and attenuated
      epithelial damage was revealed. Colonic expression of pro-inflammatory and T cell
      markers was significantly reduced in B. lactis-fed recipient mice compared to
      controls. Concomitantly, forkhead box protein 3, a marker of regulatory T cells, 
      was significantly up-regulated by B. lactis. CONCLUSION: Daily oral
      administration of B. lactis was able to reduce inflammatory and T cells mediators
      and to promote regulatory T cells specific markers in a mouse model of colitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Up to one-third of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) do 
      not respond to, or are intolerant of conventional immunosuppressive drugs.
      Although biological agents are alternative treatments, they may not be suitable
      or available to some patients. AIM: To review the evidence for use of
      nonbiological drugs in the treatment of patients with IBD refractory to
      corticosteroids or thiopurines. METHODS: A literature search was performed using 
      PubMed for English language publications with predetermined search criteria to
      identify relevant studies. RESULTS: Published evidence from uncontrolled series
      and controlled clinical trials has been used to produce a practical approach
      relevant to clinical practice which incorporates the indication, optimal dose,
      and side effects of various therapies including tacrolimus, methotrexate,
      thalidomide, tioguanine, mycophenolate mofotil, leucocyte apheresis, nutritional 
      therapy, antibiotics, probiotics, allopurinol, rectal acetarsol and ciclosporin
      in the treatment of patients with refractory ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
      disease. Approaches to optimise thiopurine efficacy are also discussed.
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD refractory to corticosteroids or thiopurines may
      respond to alternative anti-inflammatory chemical molecules, but the evidence
      base for many of these alternatives is limited and further trials are needed.

PG  - 700-2
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0b013e3181fd2742 [doi]
AB  - Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) was first described in 1959 by Hermansky and
      Pudlak. Clinically, HPS is characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, platelet
      storage pool deficiency, and ceroid tissue accumulation. It is a rare disorder
      that has been described globally but has the highest frequency in a cluster
      population in Puerto Rico. HPS patients also have major organ involvement that
      typically includes pulmonary fibrosis and granulomatous colitis. Rarely have
      cardiomyopathy and renal dysfunction been described. We report a case of the
      oldest historical patient with HPS type 6 and the associated gastrointestinal
      management.

TI  - Induction of cytokine formation by human intestinal bacteria in gut epithelial
      cell lines.
PG  - 353-63
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2672.2010.04889.x [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the effects of human gut micro-organisms on cytokine
      production by human intestinal cell lines. METHODS AND RESULTS: Quantitative
      real-time PCR assays were developed to measure the production of pro-inflammatory
      (IL-1alpha, IL-6, IL-18 and TNFalpha) and anti-inflammatory (TGF-beta1,
      TGF-beta2, TGF-beta3, IL-4 and IL-10) cytokines in HT-29 and Caco-2 cell lines.
      They were co-cultured with a range of mucosal bacteria isolated from ulcerative
      colitis patients, together with lactobacilli and bifidobacteria obtained from
      healthy people. HT-29 cells were also co-cultured with Campylobacter jejuni,
      enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), enteropathogenic E. coli and Salmonella 
      typhimurium. The majority of commensal bacteria tested suppressed the expression 
      of anti-inflammatory cytokine mRNA, increased IL-18, reduced IL-1alpha, and with 
      the exception of nonpathogenic E. coli, reduced TNF-alpha. All overtly pathogenic
      species increased both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine mRNA.
      CONCLUSION: Commensal and pathogenic species induced fundamentally different
      cytokine responses in human intestinal epithelial cell lines. SIGNIFICANCE AND
      IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Interactions between commensal bacteria tested in this study
      and the innate immune system were shown to be anti-inflammatory in nature, in
      contrast to the pathogenic organisms investigated. These data contribute towards 
      our understanding of how potential probiotic species can be used to suppress the 
      pro-inflammatory response in inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Rectal administration of Lactobacillus casei DG modifies flora composition and
      Toll-like receptor expression in colonic mucosa of patients with mild ulcerative 
      colitis.
PG  - 1178-87
LID - 10.1007/s10620-010-1384-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: An imbalance in gut microbiota seems to contribute to the development
      of chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, such as
      ulcerative colitis (UC). Although it has been suggested that probiotic
      supplementation is an effective approach to colitis, its effects on intestinal
      flora and on mucosal cytokine balance have never been explored. AIM: To evaluate 
      the effect of Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) DG, a probiotic strain, on
      colonic-associated microbiota, mucosal cytokine balance, and toll-like receptor
      (TLR) expression. METHODS: Twenty-six patients with mild left-sided UC were
      randomly allocated to one of three groups for an 8-week treatment period: the
      first group of 7 patients received oral 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) alone, the 
      second group of 8 patients received oral 5-ASA plus oral L. casei DG, and the
      third group of 11 patients received oral 5-ASA and rectal L. casei DG. Biopsies
      were collected from the sigmoid region to culture mucosal-associated microbes and
      to assess cytokine and TLR messenger RNA (mRNA) levels by quantitative real-time 
      polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: 5-ASA alone or together with oral L.
      casei DG failed to affect colonic flora and TLR expression in a significant
      manner, but when coupled with rectally administered L. casei DG, it modified
      colonic microbiota by increasing Lactobacillus spp. and reducing
      Enterobacteriaceae. It also significantly reduced TLR-4 and interleukin
      (IL)-1beta mRNA levels and significantly increased mucosal IL-10. CONCLUSIONS:
      Manipulation of mucosal microbiota by L. casei DG and its effects on the mucosal 
      immune system seem to be required to mediate the beneficial activities of
      probiotics in UC patients.

TI  - Antioxidant properties of probiotics and their protective effects in the
      pathogenesis of radiation-induced enteritis and colitis.
PG  - 285-94
LID - 10.1007/s10620-010-1307-1 [doi]
AB  - Radiation therapy has become one of the most important treatment modalities for
      human malignancy, but certain immediate and delayed side-effects on the normal
      surrounding tissues limit the amount of effective radiation that can be
      administered. After exposure of the abdominal region to ionizing radiation,
      nearly all patients experience transient symptoms of irradiation of the bowel.
      Acute-phase symptoms may persist for a short time, yet long-term complications
      can represent significant clinical conditions with high morbidity. Data from both
      experimental studies and clinical trials suggest the potential benefit for
      probiotics in radiation-induced enteritis and colitis. On the other hand, it is
      well evidenced that both useful and harmful effects of therapeutic applications
      of ionizing radiation upon living systems are ascribed to free-radical
      production. Therefore, the hypothesis that probiotics reinforce antioxidant
      defense systems of normal mucosal cells exposed to ionizing radiation may explain
      to an extent their beneficial action. The aim of this review is threefold: First,
      to make a short brief into the natural history of radiation injury to the
      intestinal tract. Second, to describe the primary interaction of ionizing
      radiation at the cellular level and demonstrate the participation of free
      radicals in the mechanisms of injury and, third, to try a more profound
      investigation into the antioxidant abilities of probiotics and prebiotics based
      on the available experimental and clinical data.
