TI  - Current dilemmas in the management of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 58-61
AB  - Considerable advances have been made in the treatment of inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) mainly in that of Crohn's disease, but many questions still remain.
      We need to develop treatments that modify the disease. The use of
      immunomodulation using cytokines and anti-cytokines is an important step to
      achieve this goal. The standard is now the chimeric monoclonal antibody against
      tumour necrosis factor (TNF) in Crohn's disease. These treatments, however, are
      associated with problems of immunogenicity and autoimmunity. Moreover a
      proportion of patients do not respond to treatment and we do not have
      measurements that predict response. The optimal use and the combined treatment
      with immunosuppression are under investigation. The safety of this treatment in
      the long-term is also not established. These costly drugs are not suitable for
      the management of mild to moderate Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC).
      If it turns out that the antigenic drive of the inappropriate immune reaction is 
      in the lumen of the gut changing the gut flora by using probiotics may be the way
      to go.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Taking live bacteria by mouth to improve health (probiotics)
      is not intuitively rational yet it is a practice with a long history. As interest
      in the effects on health of the intestinal flora has developed, along with major 
      advances in the technology for studying it, so has come a new interest in
      establishing the true benefits of probiotic therapy. This review summarizes the
      most recent contributions to this rapidly developing area. RECENT FINDINGS:
      Probiotic bacteria, mainly bifidobacteria and lactobacilli for historical
      reasons, can prevent or ameliorate some diseases. Many empirical studies have
      been done, but work to develop the ideal characteristics of probiotics lags
      behind. Current literature covers survival of probiotics in the gut, mucosal
      adherence, antibacterial/pathogen mechanisms, effects on immune function and
      clinical studies. SUMMARY: Probiotic bacteria are effective in preventing and
      reducing the severity of acute diarrhoea in children. They are also useful in
      antibiotic associated diarrhoea but not for elimination of Helicobacter pylori.
      In inflammatory bowel disease, especially ulcerative colitis, probiotics offer a 
      safe alternative to current therapy. Probiotics have been used to prevent
      urogenital tract infection with benefit and, perhaps more intriguingly, to reduce
      atopy in children. Probiotics do not invariably work and study of mechanisms is
      urgently needed.

TI  - Intestinal microflora as a therapeutic target in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 73-7
AB  - Although the causes of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remain incompletely
      understood, increasing evidence implicates intestinal microflora in the
      pathogenesis of these disorders. Alteration of intestinal flora therefore may
      offer a plausible therapeutic approach. Although recent data support a potential 
      therapeutic role for probiotics and prebiotics in patients with IBD, such
      treatments need to be further assessed by large, double-blind controlled trials. 
      A better understanding of the intestinal microflora and the mechanisms of their
      action may help us to develop more effective treatment for IBD.

TI  - Role of microecology in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - S34-8
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic conditions of unknown etiology.
      Current therapy mitigates the severity of acute bouts of mucosal inflammation but
      an eradication therapy is lacking. Growing incidence of IBD is associated with
      social development. Epidemiology suggests a relationship between the
      establishment of the individual gut flora and the risk of developing IBD.
      Patients show an impaired tolerance towards commensal bacteria of the resident
      flora. Unrestrained activation of the intestinal immune system against some
      commensal bacteria appears to be responsible for the characteristic relapsing
      course of these diseases. Wide-spectrum antibiotic therapy reduces bacterial load
      and mitigates intestinal inflammation in human IBD and in animal models. Current 
      research aims at the identification of probiotics for bacterial antagonism
      therapies. Probiotics are living microorganisms which upon ingestion in certain
      numbers exert health benefits beyond inherent basic nutrition. Colonization with 
      a Lactobacillus reuteri strain can prevent the development of colitis in
      genetically susceptible mice. Other studies have used a bacterium genetically
      engineered to secrete the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 and demonstrated a
      therapeutic effect in animal models of colitis. Moreover, some probiotics may
      naturally exhibit antiinflammatory properties when interacting with the human gut
      mucosa. Prebiotics such as inulin have also been shown to prevent colonic
      inflammation in animal models. Preliminary clinical trials with probiotics in IBD
      are encouraging. Probiotics offer a valuable tool for the prevention and control 
      of inflammatory bowel diseases.

TI  - Probiotics up-regulate MUC-2 mucin gene expression in a Caco-2 cell-culture
      model.
PG  - 586-90
AB  - Enteral probiotics such as Lactobacillus casei GG (LGG) have been used in the
      treatment of a variety of intestinal disorders in infants and children, including
      diarrhea, malabsorption, and Clostridium difficile colitis. Previous studies have
      identified the gene locus for mucin (MUC-2) and its expression in Caco-2 cells.
      Others have demonstrated that mucin, located on the surface of the intestinal
      epithelium, inhibits bacterial translocation (BT). We previously demonstrated
      that both mucin and the probiotic bacterium LGG have an inhibitory effect on BT
      in both an in-vitro Caco-2 cell model and a neonatal rabbit model. We
      hypothesized that the decline in BT by LGG is mediated by up-regulation of
      epithelial MUC-2. Human enterocyte Caco-2 cells were grown to confluence and
      incubated at 37 degrees C with either medium (control group) or 10(4) or 10(8)
      LGG for 180 min. Non-adherent LGG was washed away. Caco-2 cells were then lysed, 
      purified, and quantified for MUC-2 protein and mRNA. The addition of LGG to the
      enterocyte monolayer surface resulted in significantly ( P < 0.05) increased
      MUC-2 expression compared to the untreated monolayers. Protein densities for
      MUC-2 significantly ( P < 0.05) increased with LGG. Density (expressed as ratio
      to control group) was 8.6 +/- 1.3 in the low-dose group (10(4) LGG) and 15.6 +/- 
      2.3 in the high-dose group (10(8) LGG). LGG may thus bind to specific receptor
      sites on the enterocyte and stimulate the up-regulation of MUC-2, resulting in
      increased inhibition of BT.

PG  - 53-4, 57-8, 65 passim
AB  - C difficile infection recurs in about 20% of previously treated hospitalized
      patients. The elderly and patients with underlying colonic disease who have
      recently used antibiotics are at high risk. Signs and symptoms include diarrhea, 
      abdominal pain, and leukocytosis. Diagnosis is dependent on a high degree of
      clinical suspicion and ELISA testing of a stool sample for toxins. Recurrence is 
      thought to be due to the persistence of C difficile spores. Treatment can be
      difficult. Oral vancomycin or metronidazole for 10 to 14 days may be helpful as
      first-line therapy. Tapering the dose over 1 month helps destroy the spores while
      enabling the normal colonic flora to regrow. Probiotics, such as lactobacillus GG
      and S boulardii, are being developed to help restore normal colonic flora.
      Immunization may help prevent C difficile infection in the first place.

TI  - Evolving medical therapies for ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 497-505
AB  - Therapies for patients with ulcerative colitis have, until recently, been limited
      in scope and efficacy. New formulations of mesalamine and corticosteroids have
      challenged the older therapies with respect to both efficacy and safety. The
      application of 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine for steroid-refractory disease
      and maintenance of remission has resulted in studies of other candidate
      immunomodulatory agents. Biologic therapies targeting tumor necrosis factor,
      adhesion molecules, or other cytokines are under intense scrutiny as potential
      disease-altering agents that may even replace currently available products. Other
      approaches, including such wide-ranging products as heparin, nicotine, and
      probiotics, suggest that control of ulcerative colitis may require an
      individualized approach for each patient.

TI  - Probiotics in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.
PG  - S78-80
AB  - Antibiotic-associated diarrhoea is a common event. In some cases, it could
      represent a life-threatening event. Clostridium difficile colitis is a further
      distinct complication of antibiotic administration. Treatment options for
      antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and Clostridium difficile colitis include
      supplementation with several types of probiotics, as overviewed in this paper.
      Three randomised, double-blind, controlled clinical trials show a therapeutic
      effect of Saccharomyces boulardii in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. The
      efficacy of Lactobacillus acidophilus and bulgaricus has also been ascertained in
      two double-blind controlled studies. Other studies focusing on Lactobacillus as a
      new preventive agent for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea are not double-blind.
      Among these, a positive effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Bifidobacterium
      longum and Enterococcus faecium SF68 has been reported. Effectiveness of
      probiotics in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea has, therefore, a consistent
      scientific rationale, however few studies have performed an assessment of
      bacterial recovery in stools, and this approach may be helpful in deciding a more
      rigorous dose standardisation.

TI  - Probiotics--role in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - S58-62
AB  - The aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease is still unclean. Whilst a specific
      pathogen agent associated with these diseases has not been found, the rationale
      for probiotic therapy in inflammatory bowel disease is based on convincing
      evidence involving intestinal bacteria in their pathogenesis. Encouraging results
      have been obtained with probiotic therapy in several animal models of
      experimental colitis. The administration of highly concentrated probiotic
      preparations represents a valid approach both for the prevention of pouchitis
      onset and relapses. The encouraging results obtained in ulcerative colitis and
      Crohn's disease need to be further assessed in large double-blind trials.

TI  - Cytoskeletal proteins and resident flora.
PG  - S34-6
AB  - Recent observations demonstrate that enteropathogenetic and enterohaemorrhagic
      bacteria, as well as other non enteropathogenetic bacteria (Listeria, Coxiella
      Burnetii), may subvert the host cell cytoskeleton. Models from enteropathogenic
      bacteria demonstrate that cytoskeletal proteins are required for bacteria binding
      to the enterocytes and that they play a role in the immune response of the host
      to intestinal bacteria. The cytoskeletal protein family Tropomyosins is present
      in all eukaryotic cells, with multiple isoforms regulated by multiple genes. Of
      the different Tropomyosin isoforms, TM5 has been shown to be expressed in colonic
      and jejunal epithelial cells, while TM1 in colonic and jejunal smooth muscle. In 
      vitro studies have shown the presence of serum and mucosal IgG against TM5 in
      almost two thirds of patients with ulcerative colitis, suggesting: a. a possible 
      autoimmune response to Tropomyosin in these patients; b. the hypothesis that the 
      development of pouchitis may be related to the expression of TM5 in the ileal
      pouch; c. the use of probiotics in the treatment of pouchitis. Overall, the new
      expression of cytoskeletal proteins on the cell surface appears to be possibly
      induced by several mechanisms, including intestinal bacteria and apoptosis. The
      expression of cytoskeletal proteins on the cell surface may induce tolerance or
      autoimmune response on target cells. Further investigations are, however needed
      on the possible role of cytoskeletal proteins in human diseases.

TI  - Probiotics as modulators of the gut flora.
PG  - S39-49
AB  - Probiotic ingestion can be recommended as a preventative approach to maintaining 
      the balance of the intestinal microflora and thereby enhance 'well-being'.
      Research into the use of probiotic intervention in specific illnesses and
      disorders has identified certain patient populations that may benefit from the
      approach. Undoubtedly, probiotics will vary in their efficacy and it may not be
      the case that the same results occur with all species. Those that prove most
      efficient will likely be strains that are robust enough to survive the harsh
      physico-chemical conditions present in the gastrointestinal tract. This includes 
      gastric acid, bile secretions and competition with the resident microflora. A
      survey of the literature indicates positive results in over fifty human trials,
      with prevention/treatment of infections the most frequently reported output. In
      theory, increased levels of probiotics may induce a 'barrier' influence against
      common pathogens. Mechanisms of effect are likely to include the excretion of
      acids (lactate, acetate), competition for nutrients and gut receptor sites,
      immunomodulation and the formation of specific antimicrobial agents. As such,
      persons susceptible to diarrhoeal infections may benefit greatly from probiotic
      intake. On a more chronic basis, it has been suggested that some probiotics can
      help maintain remission in the inflammatory conditions, ulcerative colitis and
      pouchitis. They have also been suggested to repress enzymes responsible for
      genotoxin formation. Moreover, studies have suggested that probiotics are as
      effective as anti-spasmodic drugs in the alleviation of irritable bowel syndrome.
      The approach of modulating the gut flora for improved health has much relevance
      for the management of those with acute and chronic gut disorders. Other target
      groups could include those susceptible to nosocomial infections, as well as the
      elderly, who have an altered microflora, with a decreased number of beneficial
      microbial species. For the future, it is imperative that mechanistic interactions
      involved in probiotic supplementation be identified. Moreover, the survival
      issues associated with their establishment in the competitive gut ecosystem
      should be addressed. Here, the use of prebiotics in association with useful
      probiotics may be a worthwhile approach. A prebiotic is a dietary carbohydrate
      selectively metabolised by probiotics. Combinations of probiotics and prebiotics 
      are known as synbiotics.

TI  - Probiotics and inflammatory bowel disease: from fads and fantasy to facts and
      future.
PG  - S5-9
AB  - Probiotic therapy is attracting the renewed interest of clinicians and basic
      investigators from a variety of traditional research disciplines. While the
      theoretical rationale for modifying the commensal flora of the gastrointestinal
      tract in specific circumstances appears sound and requires scientific pursuit,
      the field of probiotics has been clouded by exaggerated claims from some
      quarters. In general, many of the claims for therapeutic efficacy have not been
      well substantiated, but the field is now poised for evaluation within the realm
      of evidence-based medicine. Alterations in commensal bacterial flora within the
      gastrointestinal tract are associated with susceptibility to pathogens such as
      Clostridium difficile and there is persuasive evidence that the normal flora may 
      participate in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease and other chronic
      diseases in genetically susceptible individuals. This has prompted various
      strategies to fortify or otherwise modify the enteric flora by dietary
      supplements containing probiotic formulations. Detailed comparisons of probiotic 
      performance amongst different bacterial strains have not been performed in vivo
      in man or under clinical trial conditions, and the level of scientific
      characterisation of individual organisms has been variable. In addition, it
      cannot be assumed that the same probiotic is equally suitable for all
      individuals. Moreover, the heterogeneity of clinical disorders such as Crohn's
      disease and ulcerative colitis implies that strain-specific properties may be
      required for subset-specific categories of patients. While cocktails of
      probiotics offer convenience, therapeutic progress may require clarification of
      the mechanism of probiotic action and may be delayed until individual bacterial
      components have been rigorously studied. More importantly, the full potential of 
      therapeutic manipulation of the enteric flora with probiotics or other strategies
      may not be optimally realised until the composition and metabolic activities of
      the normal flora are better understood.

TI  - Nutritional factors in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 203-18
AB  - Dietary antigens may act as important stimuli of the mucosal immune system and
      have led to the study of nutritional therapy for IBD. Patients with active CD
      respond to bowel rest, along with total enteral nutrition or TPN. Bowel rest and 
      TPN are as effective as corticosteroids at inducing remission for patients with
      active CD, although benefits are short-lived. Enteral nutrition is consistently
      less effective than conventional corticosteroids for treatment of active CD. Use 
      of palatable, liquid polymeric diets in active CD is controversial, but these
      diets are of equal efficacy when compared with elemental diets. UC has not been
      treated effectively with either elemental diets or TPN. Fish oil contains
      n-3-PUFA, which inhibits production of proinflammatory cytokines and has some
      benefit in the treatment of CD. Topical applications of short-chain fatty acids
      have benefited diversion colitis and distal UC, whereas probiotics hold promise
      in the treatment of pouchitis.

AB  - Although newer therapeutic agents are being developed for the treatment of
      inflammatory bowel disease, aminosalicylates and corticosteroids remain the
      mainstay of treatment for UC (Tables 2-5). Patients who do not respond to these
      agents or become steroid dependent require immunomodulatory therapy or curative
      surgery. Cyclosporine represents the greatest treatment advance for UC in 10
      years. The role of nicotine, heparin, antibiotics, probiotics, and SCFA in the
      treatment of UC is less clear, but these agents may offer an alternative
      therapeutic approach for patients intolerant or nonresponsive to standard
      therapy.

TI  - Effects of rifaximin administration on the intestinal microbiota in patients with
      ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 290-5
AB  - The effect of rifaximin on the intestinal bacterial population was studied in a
      clinical trial. Twelve patients with ulcerative colitis were administered
      rifaximin 1800 mg/day in 3 treatment periods of 10 days, each followed by 25 days
      of wash-out. Fecal samples were collected at the beginning and at the end of each
      treatment period to perform microbiological examinations. Titer variations of
      enterococci, coliforms, lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, Bacteroides spp., and
      Clostridium perfringens as well as their susceptibility to rifaximin during the
      different phases of the study were evaluated. The presence of Candida spp. was
      also monitored. After each wash-out period, concentrations of the intestinal
      microbial groups tested returned to initial values, showing that the
      administration of high doses of rifaximin does not significantly modify the
      colonic microbiota. Rifaximin-resistant isolates were also found, particularly in
      bacteria belonging to Bifidobacterium genus, included as probiotics in several
      fermented foods and in pharmaceutical preparations.

AB  - Significant advances have been made regarding our understanding of the
      etiopathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. This review focuses on the most
      recent applications of medical therapy for ulcerative colitis. Therapeutic
      approaches continue to evolve regarding inductive and maintenance strategies with
      oral and topical aminosalicylates, systemic and non-systemic corticosteroids, and
      cyclosporine and alternative immunomodulators. As further investigations continue
      to discern microbiological and immunoinflammatory targets, future therapies may
      include both probiotics and novel biological agents.

TI  - Review article: maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 21-4
AB  - Seventy percent of patients with ulcerative colitis can expect to experience a
      relapse over a 12 month period. Sulfasalazine was the first drug demonstrated to 
      reduce this relapse rate to 21 percent. Subsequent studies have demonstrated that
      5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) is the main active component, and preparations
      containing only 5-ASA have similar efficacy to sulfasalazine. 5-ASA is readily
      absorbed from the small intestine; to achieve high a colonic lumenal
      concentration therefore requires special release formulation. A variety of 5-ASA 
      preparations is available, differing in their release mechanism, efficacy and
      side effect profile. Most patients can be maintained in remission using oral
      5-ASA medication. For patients with distal or left sided disease the use of
      rectal 5-ASA is also of proven benefit in maintaining remission. Some patients
      with frequent or severe relapses require stronger immunosuppression, and in these
      patients azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) are of proven benefit.
      Azathioprine is also invaluable for maintaining remission in patients who have
      been treated with cyclosporin for a fulminant acute episode of colitis. The
      exciting spectre of natural bacterial therapies (probiotics) deserves further
      exploration.

TI  - Review article: treatment of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and pouchitis.
PG  - 13-9
AB  - The meta-analyses of published trials have shown topical therapy with
      5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) to be the treatment of choice in active distal
      ulcerative colitis. Oral aminosalicylates are effective for both distal and
      extensive ulcerative colitis, but in distal colitis the rates of improvement and 
      remission are usually lower than those reported for rectal 5-ASA therapy. An
      alternative to 5-ASA therapy is represented by the new steroids; budesonide and
      beclometasone dipropionate (BDP) enemas, the most extensively studied, have been 
      shown to be as effective as conventional steroids but with a significantly lower 
      inhibition of plasma cortisol. Patients who do not respond to 5-ASA or new
      steroids should be treated with oral steroids. Azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine
      may be effective in patients who do not respond or cannot be weaned off steroids.
      Treatment of pouchitis is largely empirical and few controlled studies have been 
      carried-out. Antibiotics are the treatment of choice and most patients make a
      good response to metronidazole or ciprofloxacin. Chronic refractory pouchitis may
      benefit from a prolonged course of a combination of antibiotics. Highly
      concentrated probiotics (VSL#3) are effective both for the prevention of
      pouchitis onset and the prevention of relapses.

TI  - A critical assessment of new therapies in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - S176-85
AB  - The only therapy in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which up to the mid-1990s
      was disease modifying, was immunosuppression with azathioprine. Other 'standard' 
      therapies in IBD were merely symptomatic. With the advent of biological
      therapies, especially the chimeric monoclonal anti-TNF antibody infliximab, we
      start to target specific pathogenic disease mechanisms, which allow thorough
      suppression of the disease process and healing of the bowel in the long term.
      Moreover, infliximab is the only drug up to the present that allows short-term
      healing of fistulizing Crohn's disease. This therapy is, however, associated with
      problems of immunogenicity. The formation of antibodies to infliximab jeopardizes
      the efficacy and is associated with infusion reactions. Optimization of anti-TNF 
      strategies will occur in the coming years. Another promising therapy is
      antagonization of alpha4 integrins and hence, of migration of inflammatory cells 
      to the intestine. It can be expected that more simple therapies using small
      molecules that inhibit the key cytokines or pro-inflammatory processes will take 
      over in the next decade. In the current and future approach to IBD therapy
      immunosuppression with azathioprine or 6-MP and methotrexate play a central role.
      At the present time, the combination of infliximab with azathioprine or
      methotrexate can be regarded as the new standard for the therapy of refractory
      Crohn's disease. In ulcerative colitis (UC) much less progress has been made and 
      the value of biological therapy as well as of long-term management with
      immunosuppression remains controversial. Probiotics are an attractive treatment
      option for IBD but studies so far are small and data are not yet convincing.

TI  - [Probiotics in gastroenterology].
PG  - 197-201
AB  - Probiotics are defined as live microorganisms of human origin. Their use may
      favorably influence human health and ameliorate or prevent certain diseases.
      Prebiotics are non-digestible foodstuffs (fiber, oligofructans - "colonic
      foods"), which enter the colon and are metabolized by the probiotics. Probiotics 
      should fulfill the following criteria: Phenotypic and genotypic classification,
      no pathogenic properties, human origin, application in the living state,
      resistance to gastric acid and bile, ability to adhere to colonocytes, ability to
      colonize the gut, clinically proved favorable health-effect, and safety.
      Experimental and clinical studies supplied evidence of the possible use of
      probiotics in the following diseases: Traveler's diarrhea, antibiotic-associated 
      diarrhea, relapsing Clostridium difficile colitis, infantile diarrhea, rotavirus 
      enteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, colon cancer,
      peritonitis, acute pancreatitis, and diarrhea associated with HIV infection.
      Probiotics displayed the following effects in these studies: Involvement in
      production of essential nutrients of the colonic mucosa, beneficial effect on
      intestinal immunity, recovery of the disturbed gut mucosal barrier and prevention
      of microbial translocation, elimination of toxins and eradication of microbial
      pathogens, production of steroids from cholesterol and reduction of its pool in
      circulation, participation in regulation of intestinal functions, reduced
      incidence of chemically induced colon tumors in rodents. Probiotics open new
      therapeutic modalities in a number of diseases and it may be expected that their 
      importance will increase with growing knowledge and experience.

PG  - 331-40
AB  - Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the rectum and colon.
      Results from many studies in people and animals of intestinal inflammation
      suggest that ulcerative colitis results from environmental factors triggering a
      loss of tolerance for normal intestinal flora in genetically susceptible
      individuals. Although progress has been made in the overall management of the
      disease, no innovative treatment has been developed. By contrast with Crohn's
      disease, there are few clinical data on biological agents. Probiotics seem the
      most promising of several experimental and traditional agents that have been
      investigated in controlled clinical trials.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 63-8
AB  - This article reviews a selection of 50 papers on inflammatory bowel disease
      published between April 2000 and June 2001. The new information summarized here
      includes: the discovery of the association of the NOD2 gene with Crohn's disease;
      the role of bacteria and the modulating effects of probiotics; the inverse
      association of appendectomy and ulcerative colitis; progress in imaging based on 
      magnetic resonance imaging and leukocyte scintigraphy; assessment of the value of
      anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies in the screening of inflammatory bowel
      disease and differentiation between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease; and
      risk factors and management of dysplasia and cancer. This article does not review
      all therapeutic aspects, but focuses on smoking cessation; anti-tumor necrosis
      factor antibody treatments; the usefulness of measuring erythrocyte 6-thioguanine
      metabolite levels to optimize purine analogue therapy; strictureplasty; and the
      long-term results of ileoanal anastomosis.

TI  - The use of probiotics in gastrointestinal disease.
PG  - 817-22
AB  - Probiotics are living microorganisms that can affect the host in a beneficial
      manner. Prebiotics are nondigestible food ingredients that stimulate the growth
      and activity of probiotic bacteria already established in the colon. Efficacy of 
      probiotic compounds has been shown in a wide range of gastrointestinal diseases. 
      Lactobacillus GG alone, or the combination of Bifidobacterium bifidum and
      Streptococcus thermophilus, is effective in the treatment of Clostridium
      difficile, as well as in preventing the frequency and severity of infectious
      acute diarrhea in children. Prevention of antibiotic-induced diarrhea with the
      concomitant administration of either Lactobacillus GG or Saccharomyces boulardii 
      has been demonstrated. The most successful studies involve the use of
      Lactobacillus GG at a dose of 1 x 1010 viable organisms per day and the yeast
      boulardii at a dose of 1 g/day. A probiotic preparation (VSL#3 - 6 g/day) that
      uses a combination of three species of Bifidobacterium, four strains of
      Lactobacillus and one strain of Streptocccus has shown promise in maintaining
      remission in ulcerative colitis and pouchitis, as well as in preventing the
      postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease. The mechanism of action of
      probiotics may include receptor competition, effects on mucin secretion or
      probiotic immunomodulation of gut-associated lymphoid tissue. Oral administration
      of probiotic compounds has been demonstrated to be well tolerated and safe.
      However, while probiotics have the potential to improve human health and to
      prevent and treat some diseases, major improvements are needed in labelling and
      quality assurance procedures for probiotic compounds. In addition, well planned
      and controlled clinical studies are necessary to delineate fully the potential
      for probiotic compounds.

TI  - The bacterial flora in inflammatory bowel disease: current insights in
      pathogenesis and the influence of antibiotics and probiotics.
PG  - 29-40
AB  - The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains unknown, although in
      recent years more data have become available. The contribution of genetic and
      environmental factors is evident, and the luminal bacterial flora plays a major
      role in the initiation and perpetuation of chronic IBD. Animal models of IBD have
      shown that colitis does not occur in a germ-free environment. In human IBD,
      inflammation is present in parts of the gut containing the highest bacterial
      concentrations. Moreover, the terminal ileum, caecum and rectum are areas of
      relative stasis, providing prolonged mucosal contact with luminal contents.
      Enhanced mucosal permeability may play a pivotal role in maintaining a chronic
      inflammatory state, due to a genetic predisposition or as a result of direct
      contact with bacteria or their products. A detective epithelial barrier may cause
      a loss of tolerance to the normal enteric flora. Furthermore, an increased
      mucosal absorption of viable bacteria and bacterial products is found in IBD.
      Serum and secreted antibodies are increased and mucosal T-lymphocytes that
      recognize luminal bacteria are present. However, there is evidence that the
      immune system reacts over aggressively towards the normal luminal flora rather
      than the flora being altered in IBD. Several approaches have been used in
      attempts to discover a specific microbial agent in the cause of IBD. These
      include demonstration of the presence of organisms or specific antigens in
      affected tissues, culture of microbes firm the affected tissues, demonstration of
      serological responses to several agents, and localization and detection of
      individual pathogen-specific nucleic acid sequences in affected tissue by in situ
      hybridization and polymerase chain reaction. So far, no specific micro-organism
      has been directly associated with the pathogenesis of IBD. Analysis of the
      luminal enteric flora, however, has revealed differences in the composition of
      this flora compared to healthy controls. In Crohn disease, concentrations of
      Bacteroides, Eubacteria and Peptostreptococcus are increased, whereas
      Bifidobacteria numbers are significantly reduced. Furthermore, in ulcerative
      colitis, concentrations of facultative anaerobic bacteria are increased. The
      arrival of new molecular techniques qualifying and quantifying the complex
      intestinal flora has induced a revival of interest in this microflora.
      Therapeutic approaches geared towards changing the environment at the mucosal
      border have been attempted by the use of elemental diets, total parenteral
      nutrition, surgical diversion of the faecal stream and antibiotics. Over the past
      few years, the use of probiotics in IBD and other intestinal disorders has gained
      attention. Strengthened by promising experimental data and commercial interests, 
      research in this field is rapidly expanding. Manipulation of the colonic bacteria
      with antibiotic drugs and probiotic agents may prove to be more effective and
      better tolerated than immunosuppressants in the future.

TI  - Inhibitory activity of Bifidobacterium longum HY8001 against Vero cytotoxin of
      Escherichia coli O157:H7.
PG  - 1667-73
AB  - Vero cytotoxin (VT)-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC), such as E. coli O157:H7,
      are emerging foodborne pathogens worldwide. VTs are associated with hemorrhagic
      colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome in humans. Attachment of the B subunit of
      VTs to its receptor, globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), at gut epithelium is the
      primary step and, consequently, the A subunit of VTs inhibits protein synthesis
      in the target cell. Proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1beta, up-regulate Gb3 expression, increase
      sensitivity to VTs, and enhance VT action in developing disease. Currently, there
      is a growing interest in probiotics, given the increasing occurrence of
      antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In particular, much work on bifidobacteria among
      probiotics, regarded as microorganisms targeted for technological and therapeutic
      applications, has been performed. In Korea, the neutralizing effect of the
      culture supernatant of Bifidobacterium longum HY8001, Korean isolate, against the
      VTs from E. coli O157:H7 was found. Therefore, this study focused on the raveling
      of the inhibitory effect of B. longum HY8001 against VTs, through the
      interference B subunit of VTs and Gb3 interaction. Mice were inoculated
      intragastrically with B. longum HY8001 culture supernatant before and after
      challenge with E. coli O157:H7. Control mice were inoculated intragastrically
      only with E. coli O157:H7. Cytokine, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta levels in sera and
      expression of their mRNA were decreased, and expression of Gb3 in renal tubular
      epithelial cells was reduced in mice treated with B. longum HY8001 culture
      supernatant. In competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), the
      culture supernatant of B. longum HY8001 primarily binds VTs to interfere the VTs 
      with Gb3 interaction. These results suggest that soluble substance(s) in B.
      longum HY8001 culture supernatant may have inhibitory activity on the expression 
      of Gb3, VT-Gb3 interaction, or both. Further study should be done to elucidate
      the property of soluble substances in B. longum HY8001 culture supernatant.

TI  - Evolving medical therapies for ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 464-70
AB  - Patients with ulcerative colitis have traditionally relied on sulfasalazine,
      mesalamine, and corticosteroids as the mainstay of medical therapy.
      Steroid-refractory, -dependent, or -intolerant patients have resorted to agents
      such as cyclosporine for short-term efficacy and 6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine
      for long-term efficacy. The next generation of evolving therapies includes many
      novel agents that target various aspects of the human immune response. Therapies 
      that block the production or action of tumor necrosis factor have received much
      interest in inflammatory bowel disease. Treatments currently under study include 
      interleukins, interferons, T-cell selective antibodies, molecules involved in
      cellular trafficking and signaling, mucosal healing or growth factors, and novel 
      steroid agents. Other "less traditional" therapies, including probiotics,
      heparins, and anti-gastric ulcer remedies, challenge our understanding of the
      pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis and may provide further insights into future
      therapies.

TI  - Probiotic bacteria enhance murine and human intestinal epithelial barrier
      function.
PG  - 580-91
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The probiotic compound, VSL#3, is efficacious as maintenance
      therapy in pouchitis and ulcerative colitis. The aim of this study was to
      determine the efficacy of VSL#3 as a primary therapy in the treatment of colitis 
      in the interleukin (IL)-10 gene-deficient mouse. Mechanisms of action of VSL#3
      were investigated in T(84) monolayers. METHODS: IL-10 gene-deficient and control 
      mice received 2.8 x 10(8) colony-forming units per day of VSL#3 for 4 weeks.
      Colons were removed and analyzed for cytokine production, epithelial barrier
      function, and inflammation. VSL#3 or conditioned media was applied directly to
      T(84) monolayers. RESULTS: Treatment of IL-10 gene-deficient mice with VSL#3
      resulted in normalization of colonic physiologic function and barrier integrity
      in conjunction with a reduction in mucosal secretion of tumor necrosis factor
      alpha and interferon gamma and an improvement in histologic disease. In vitro
      studies showed that epithelial barrier function and resistance to Salmonella
      invasion could be enhanced by exposure to a proteinaceous soluble factor secreted
      by the bacteria found in the VSL#3 compound. CONCLUSIONS: Oral administration of 
      VSL#3 was effective as primary therapy in IL-10 gene-deficient mice, and had a
      direct effect on epithelial barrier function.

TI  - Biological therapies for ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 205-9
AB  - Biological therapies are being increasingly investigated for the treatment of
      inflammatory bowel disease. However, a great deal more study has been devoted to 
      studies of Crohn's disease rather than ulcerative colitis. Ulcerative colitis,
      like Crohn's disease, represents an area of high clinical need, particularly for 
      those patients who have disease inadequately responsive to corticosteroids and
      5-aminosalicylates. The distinct anatomic distribution of inflammation in
      ulcerative colitis represents an important model for study, with the entire
      involved mucosa entirely accessible to endoscopy. In addition, there is an
      opportunity for local delivery of biologic agents in left-sided disease. Distinct
      pathogenetic factors in ulcerative colitis raise the possibility of therapies
      quite different from those used in Crohn's disease. This work describes the
      current state of knowledge regarding biological therapy in ulcerative colitis.
      The role of probiotic therapy, and studies of cytokine-directed therapies,
      therapies targeting adhesion and recruitment, and restitution and repair are
      described.

TI  - Treatment of gastrointestinal viruses.
PG  - 289-300; discussion 300-5
AB  - The most common enteric viruses responsible for diarrhoea are rotavirus, enteric 
      adenoviruses, caliciviruses including the Norwalk agent and astrovirus. These
      infections are usually mild to moderate in severity, self-limiting and of short
      duration and thus, specific antiviral therapy is not recommended. The standard
      management of these infections is restoration of fluid and electrolyte balance
      and then maintenance of hydration until the infection resolves. WHO oral
      rehydration therapy (ORT) was introduced about 30 years ago and has saved the
      lives of many infants and young children. During the last 10 years it has become 
      evident that the efficacy of ORT can be increased by reducing the osmolality of
      the WHO oral rehydration solution (ORS) to produce a relatively hypotonic
      solution. Hypotonic ORS appears to be safe and effective in all forms of acute
      diarrhoea in childhood. Complex substrate ORS, which is also usually hypotonic,
      has been shown to have increased efficacy in cholera but not in other bacterial
      or viral diarrhoeas. Nevertheless, the scientific rationale for using rice or
      resistant starch as substrate in ORS is of physiological interest. Other
      treatments such as hyperimmune bovine colostrum, probiotics and antiviral agents 
      are largely experimental and have not been introduced into routine clinical
      practice. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection of the gastrointestinal tract occurs
      mainly in the immunocompromised although it has been reported in immunocompetent 
      individuals. CMV infects both the oesophagus and colon to produce oesophagitis,
      often with discrete ulcers, and colitis, respectively. Both conditions can be
      treated with ganciclovir or foscarnet. Failure to respond to monotherapy is an
      indication to use both agents concurrently.

TI  - Effect of probiotics on enterocyte bacterial translocation in vitro.
PG  - 265-8
AB  - Enteral probiotics such as Lactobacillus casei GG (LGG) have been used in the
      treatment of a variety of intestinal disorders in infants and children, including
      diarrhea, malabsorption, and Clostridium difficile colitis. We have previously
      demonstrated that the probiotic bacterium LGG has an inhibitory effect on
      bacterial translocation (BT) in a neonatal rabbit model. However, this in-vivo
      model is limited for investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms
      responsible for probiotic inhibition of BT. The purpose of this study was to
      determine the efficacy of LGG in reducing the rate of Escherichia coli C25 (E.
      coli C25) translocation using an in-vitro enterocyte cell-culture model. Human
      colonic carcinoma (Caco-2) enterocytes were seeded in porous filters in the
      apical chamber of a two-chamber cell-culture system and grown for 14 days to
      confluence. The monolayers were incubated at 37 degrees C with LGG for 180 min.
      Non-adherent LGG was washed away prior to a 120-min incubation period with 10(5) 
      CFU E. coli C25. E. coli that had translocated across the enterocyte monolayer
      were quantified by growing basal-chamber media samples on gram-negative
      bacteria-specific MacConkey's agar. In order to determine monolayer integrity,
      transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was measured across Caco-2 cells
      treated with LGG and E. coli. Statistical analysis was by ANOVA with P < 0.05
      considered significant. LGG inhibited E. coli translocation at all LGG
      concentrations tested. The TEER ratio was not significantly altered by addition
      of LGG or E. coli (0.9 +/- 0.03 vs 0.8 +/- 0.05). These results demonstrate that 
      the probiotic bacterium LGG inhibits BT of E. coli C25 in a dose-dependent manner
      in an in-vitro cell-culture model. This model should be valuable in investigating
      the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the inhibition of pathological 
      enteral bacteria by probiotic agents.

TI  - Adaptation of bacteria to the intestinal niche: probiotics and gut disorder.
PG  - 136-45
AB  - The gastrointestinal tract is a complex ecosystem host to a diverse and highly
      evolved microbial community composed of hundreds of different microbial species. 
      The interactions that occur between this complex microbial community and the
      human host have become the focus of scientific research due to increases in the
      incidence of illnesses associated with deficient or compromised microflora (e.g.,
      gastrointestinal tract infections, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease
      and ulcerative colitis), irritable bowel syndrome, antibiotic-induced diarrhea,
      constipation, food allergies, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers).
      Effective multidisciplinary research programs now complement conventional
      microbiology with molecular ecology techniques to provide culture-independent
      analysis of the gastrointestinal ecosystem. Furthermore, as we acquire an
      understanding of gut microflora composition and processes such as intestinal
      adherence, colonization, translocation, and immunomodulation, we are also
      elucidating mechanisms by which these can be influenced. This knowledge not only 
      allows scientists to define the activities and interactions of "functional
      food"-borne beneficial bacteria in the gut, but will also provide the scientific 
      basis for the development of innovative biotechnology-based products tailored to 
      prevent specific diseases and promote overall human gastrointestinal health.

TI  - Behaviour of the pharmaceutical probiotic preparation VSL#3 in human ileostomy
      effluent containing its own natural elements.
PG  - 23-33
AB  - The pharmaceutical probiotic VSL#3 (300 billion cfu/g lactic acid bacteria &
      bifidobacteria) was inoculated into human ileostomy effluent (HIE) to assess its 
      behaviour vs the ileo-caecal tract. Separately, yogurt bacteria (yog) and
      bifidobacteria (Bif) present in VSL#3 were also inoculated into HIE. During 37
      degrees C incubation (anaerobic condition) at zero, six and 24 hours, both cell
      growth in control HIE and indigenous Bif growth in HIE+yog were observed. Cells
      remained viable and metabolically active as shown by the increase in L(+) lactic 
      acid in HIE+VSL#3 and HIE+yog and the pH decreased (approx. 5.5 compared with the
      6.2 of control HIE). Total SCFA Short Chain Fatty Acids decreased in HIE+yog and 
      HIE+VSL#3 at 6h and in all cultures at 24h; butyric acid decreased in HIE+Bif and
      HIE+VSL#3. Generally in vivo the bacteria remain in the ileo-caecal tract no
      longer than six h, therefore VSL#3 bacteria seem able to pass this barrier
      viably, colonizing the large bowel.

LID - 10.1093/ajcn/73.2.386s [doi]
AB  - The enteric flora comprises approximately 95% of the total number of cells in the
      human body and can elicit immune responses while protecting against microbial
      pathogens. However, the resident bacterial flora of the gastrointestinal tract
      may also be implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases such as inflammatory bowel
      disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease). The objectives of the Probiotic
      Research Group based at University College Cork were to isolate and identify
      lactic acid bacteria exhibiting beneficial probiotic traits, such as bile
      tolerance in the absence of deconjugation activity, acid resistance, adherence to
      host epithelial tissue, and in vitro antagonism of pathogenic microorganisms or
      those suspected of promoting inflammation. To isolate potentially effective
      probiotic bacteria, we screened the microbial population adhering to surgically
      resected segments of the gastrointestinal tract (the environment in which they
      may subsequently be reintroduced and required to function). In total, 1500
      bacterial strains from resected human terminal ilea were assessed. From among
      these organisms, Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salivarius strain UCC118 was
      selected for further study. In mouse feeding trials, milk-borne L. salivarius
      strain UCC118 could successfully colonize the murine gastrointestinal tract. A
      human feeding study conducted in 80 healthy volunteers showed that yogurt can be 
      used as a vehicle for delivery of strain UCC118 to the human gastrointestinal
      tract with considerable efficacy in influencing gut flora and colonization. In
      summary, we developed criteria for in vitro selection of probiotic bacteria that 
      may reflect certain in vivo effects on the host such as modulation of
      gastrointestinal tract microflora.
