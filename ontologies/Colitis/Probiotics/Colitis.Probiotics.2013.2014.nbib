AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Many Chinese herbs are traditionally used as
      medicine to improve the functions of gastrointestinal tract. Some of these herbs 
      are also promising agents for the improvement of the gut microbiota and the
      treatment of ulcerative colitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: By screening seven
      traditional Chinese herbs, we found that Red Ginseng and Semen Coicis were the
      most effective in promoting the growth of probiotics including Lactobacillus and 
      Bifidobacterium in vitro. We then evaluated the effects of Red Ginseng and Semen 
      Coicis on the growth of the bacterial pathogens (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus
      aureus, and Salmonella spp.) in vitro. In in vivo experiment, we gavage
      administrated trinitro-benzene-sulfonic acid induced ulcerative colitis (UC) rats
      with Red Ginseng and Semen Coicis extracts. After two weeks treatment, we
      analyzed the structure of the gut microbiota and examined the UC symptoms by
      employing qPCR and animal pathology detection techniques. RESULTS: Both Red
      Ginseng and Semen Coicis promoted the growth of probiotics - Bifidobacterium and 
      Lactobacillus in vitro. Red Ginseng also inhibited the growth of some pathogen
      strains. In vivo, Red Ginseng and Semen Coicis improved the structure of gut
      microbiota and relieved the symptoms of ulcerative colitis in vivo. Compared with
      Semen Coicis, Red Ginseng was more effective in relieving the symptoms of
      ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Red Ginseng could promote the growth of
      probiotic bacteria in vitro. Red Ginseng and, to a lesser extent Semen Coicis,
      gave positive results in an experimental in vivo model for ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Probiotics for antibiotic-associated diarrhea: do we have a verdict?
PG  - 17788-95
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i47.17788 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics use has increased tremendously over the past ten years. This was
      coupled with a surge of data relating their importance in clinical practice.
      Antibiotic-associated diarrhea, whose frequency has risen recently, was one of
      the earliest targets with data published more than ten years ago. Unfortunately, 
      available trials suffer from severe discrepancies associated with variability and
      heterogeneity of several factors. Most published randomized controlled trials and
      subsequent meta-analyses suggest benefit for probiotics in the prevention of
      antibiotic-associated diarrhea. The same seems to also apply when the data is
      examined for Clostridium difficile-associated colitis. However, the largest
      randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to date examining the use of a
      certain preparation of probiotics in antibiotic-associated diarrhea showed
      disappointing results, but it was flawed with several drawbacks. The commonest
      species of probiotics studied across most trials is Lactobacillus; however, other
      types have also shown similar benefit. Probiotics have enjoyed an impeccable
      safety reputation. Despite a few reports of severe infections sometimes leading
      to septicemia, most of the available trials confirm their harmless behavior and
      show similar adverse events compared to placebo. Since a consensus dictating its 
      use is still lacking, it would be advisable at this point to suggest prophylactic
      use of probiotics to certain patients at risk for antibiotic-associated diarrhea 
      or to those who suffered previous episodes.

TI  - The probiotic mixture VSL#3 dampens LPS-induced chemokine expression in human
      dendritic cells by inhibition of STAT-1 phosphorylation.
PG  - e115676
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0115676 [doi]
AB  - VSL#3, a mixture of 8 different probiotic bacteria, has successfully been used in
      the clinic to treat Ulcerative Colitis. We previously identified the modulation
      of chemokines as a major mechanism in the protective effect of the VSL#3 in a
      mouse model of colitis. This was supported by in vitro studies that implicated a 
      role for VSL#3 in the suppression of LPS-induced chemokine production by mouse
      bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DC). Herein, we validated these findings
      employing human monocyte-derived DC. Stimulation of human DC with LPS, VSL#3, or 
      a combination of both resulted in their maturation, evident from enhanced
      expression of activation markers on the cell-surface, as well as the induction of
      various chemokines and cytokines. Interestingly, a set of LPS-induced chemokines 
      was identified that were suppressed by VSL#3. These included CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL2,
      CCL7, and CCL8. In silico approaches identified STAT-1 as a dominant regulator of
      these chemokines, and this was confirmed by demonstrating that LPS-induced
      phosphorylation of this transcription factor was inhibited by VSL#3. This
      indicates that VSL#3 may contribute to the control of inflammation by selective
      suppression of STAT-1 induced chemokines.

TI  - Probiotics and antibiotics in IBD.
PG  - 10-7
LID - 10.1159/000367820 [doi]
AB  - The involvement of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBD is supported by 
      many findings and is thus now commonly acknowledged. The imbalance in the
      composition of the microbiota (dysbiosis) observed in IBD patients is one of the 
      strongest arguments and provides the rationale for a therapeutic manipulation of 
      the gut microbiota. The tools available to achieve this goal include fecal
      microbiota transplantation, but antibiotics and probiotics have been the most
      used one until now. Although antibiotics have shown some efficacy in inducing
      remission in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), as well as
      preventing postoperative relapse in CD, they are not currently recommended for
      the treatment of IBD except for septic complications, notably because of
      long-term tolerance and ecological issues. Some probiotics have been shown to be 
      as good as 5-aminosalicylic acid to maintain remission in mild-to-moderate UC,
      but have been disappointing until now in CD in all tested indications. In
      pouchitis, antibiotics and probiotics have shown efficacy for inducing and
      maintaining remission, respectively. Targeting the gut microbiota in IBD is an
      attractive strategy. Current efforts to better understand the host-microbiota
      interactions in physiological as well as disease settings might lead to the
      development of rational-based treatments.

AB  - Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens M1 (M1) has been shown to possess many different
      beneficial health effects including anti-colitis activity. The purpose of this
      study was to develop a novel and easily scaled-up encapsulating technique that
      would improve the temperature tolerance of the bacterium and reduce the
      sensitivity of the organism to gastrointestinal fluid. A mixture of sodium
      alginate, gellan gum and skim milk powder was used as a coating material to
      entrap M1. The M1 gel was then directly freeze dried in order to dehydrate the
      covering and form microcapsules. The viable cell numbers of M1 present only
      dropped ten folds after the freeze-drying encapsulation process. The viable cell 
      counts remained constant at 5 x 10(7) CFU/g after heating from 25 degrees C to 75
      degrees C and holding at 75 degrees C for 1 min. The viable cell counts were
      reduced to 10(6) CFU/g and 10(5) CFU/g after 8-week storage at 4 degrees C and
      subsequent heat treatment with simulated gastrointestinal fluid test (SGFT) and
      bile salts, respectively. The effect of encapsulated M1 on the organism's
      anti-colitis activity was evaluated using the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)
      induced colitis mouse model. An in vivo study indicated that administration of
      heat treated encapsulated M1 was able to ameliorate DSS-induced colitis producing
      a significant reduction in the bleeding score and an attenuation of inflammatory 
      score. These findings clearly demonstrate that encapsulation of M1 using this
      novel technique is able to provide good protection from temperature changes and
      SGFT treatment and also does not affect the organism's anti-colitis activity.

AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are intestinal disorders that
      comprise the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). These disorders have a
      significant effect on the quality of life of affected patients and the increasing
      number of IBD cases worldwide is a growing concern. Because of the overall burden
      of IBD and its multifactorial etiology, efforts have been made to improve the
      medical management of these inflammatory conditions. The classical therapeutic
      strategies aim to control the exacerbated host immune response with
      aminosalicylates, antibiotics, corticosteroids, thiopurines, methotrexate and
      anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) biological agents. Although successful in the
      treatment of several CD or UC conditions, these drugs have limited effectiveness,
      and variable responses may culminate in unpredictable outcomes. The ideal therapy
      should reduce inflammation without inducing immunosuppression, and remains a
      challenge to health care personnel. Recently, a number of additional approaches
      to IBD therapy, such as new target molecules for biological agents and cellular
      therapy, have shown promising results. A deeper understanding of IBD pathogenesis
      and the availability of novel therapies are needed to improve therapeutic
      success. This review describes the overall key features of therapies currently
      employed in clinical practice as well as novel and future alternative IBD
      treatment methods.

AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a leading form of inflammatory bowel disease that
      involves chronic relapsing or progressive inflammation. As a significant
      proportion of UC patients treated with conventional therapies do not achieve
      remission, there is a pressing need for the development of more effective
      therapies. The human gut contains a large, diverse, and dynamic population of
      microorganisms, collectively referred to as the enteric microbiota. There is a
      symbiotic relationship between the human host and the enteric microbiota, which
      provides nutrition, protection against pathogenic organisms, and promotes immune 
      homeostasis. An imbalance of the normal enteric microbiota composition (termed
      dysbiosis) underlies the pathogenesis of UC. A reduction of enteric microbiota
      diversity has been observed in UC patients, mainly affecting the
      butyrate-producing bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, which can
      repress pro-inflammatory cytokines. Many studies have shown that enteric
      microbiota plays an important role in anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory
      activities, which can benefit UC patients. Therefore, manipulation of the
      dysbiosis is an attractive approach for UC therapy. Various therapies targeting a
      restoration of the enteric microbiota have shown efficacy in treating patients
      with active and chronic forms of UC. Such therapies include fecal microbiota
      transplantation, probiotics, prebiotics, antibiotics, helminth therapy, and
      dietary polyphenols, all of which can alter the abundance and composition of the 
      enteric microbiota. Although there have been many large, randomized controlled
      clinical trials assessing these treatments, the effectiveness and safety of these
      bacteria-driven therapies need further evaluation. This review focuses on the
      important role that the enteric microbiota plays in maintaining intestinal
      homeostasis and discusses new therapeutic strategies targeting the enteric
      microbiota for UC.

TI  - Human gut dendritic cells drive aberrant gut-specific t-cell responses in
      ulcerative colitis, characterized by increased IL-4 production and loss of IL-22 
      and IFNgamma.
PG  - 2299-307

AB  - : The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease is incompletely understood but
      results from a dysregulated intestinal immune response to the luminal microbiota.
      CD4 T cells mediate tissue injury in the inflammatory bowel disease-associated
      immune response. Dendritic cells (DC) generate primary T-cell responses and
      mediate intestinal immune tolerance to prevent overt inflammation in response to 
      the gut microbiota. However, most information regarding function of intestinal DC
      has come from mouse models, and information in humans is scarce. We show here
      that intestinal DC subsets are skewed in ulcerative colitis (UC) in humans, with 
      a loss of CD103 lymph-node homing DC; this intestinal DC subset preferentially
      generates regulatory T cells in mice. We show infiltrates of DC negative for
      myeloid marker CD11c, with enhanced expression of Toll-like receptors for
      bacterial recognition. After mixed leukocyte reaction, DC from the inflamed UC
      colon had an enhanced ability to generate gut-specific CD4 T cells with enhanced 
      production of interleukin-4 but a loss of interferon gamma and interleukin-22
      production. Conditioning intestinal DC with probiotic strain Lactobacillus casei 
      Shirota in UC partially restored their normal function indicated by reduced
      Toll-like receptor 2/4 expression and restoration of their ability to imprint
      homing molecules on T cells and to generate interleukin-22 production by
      stimulated T cells. This study suggests that T-cell dysfunction in UC is driven
      by DC. T-cell responses can be manipulated indirectly through effects of
      bacterial conditioning on gut DC with implications for immunomodulatory effects
      of the commensal microbiota in vivo. Manipulation of DC to allow generation of
      DC-specific therapy may be beneficial in inflammatory bowel disease.

AB  - In this paper a review of the researches on the role of Escherichia coli strain
      Nissle 1917 (EcN) in gastrointestinal diseases was presented. EcN is a
      non-pathogenic strain of the Enterobacteriaceae family, which has probiotic
      properties. In a number of studies conducted among humans and experimental
      animals the application of EcN in treatment of gastrointestinal diseases was
      observed. Most studies about EcN has been devoted to this organism efficacy in
      ulcerative colitis treatment. Comparable results were obtained, by citied
      authors, in the treatment (sustaining remission) of EcN and mesalazine in
      ulcerative colitis. Moreover, this probiotic therapy, compared to placebo,
      contributes to obtaining a faster remission and improvement of intestinal
      histopathology. The use of EcN in Crohn's disease has not been the subject of as 
      many studies as in the case of ulcerative colitis. Assessing the importance of
      EcN in treatment of other gastrointestinal disorders, authors of the studies
      observed, that in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, who receiving this
      probiotic there was a pain, nausea and bloating reduction. In studies conducted
      among children a positive impact of EcN in prevention and treatment of diarrhea
      was demonstrated. Similar results were obtained in studies conducted in
      experimental animals. Based on the presented review it can be concluded that the 
      strain of Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 is useful in treatment of gastrointestinal
      diseases, especially in treatment of ulcerative colitis. This probiotic may
      constitute a part of treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and diarrhea. The
      effectiveness of this strain in treatment of Crohn's disease is not clearly
      established and further research are require.

AB  - The way we treat inflammatory bowel disease is rapidly changing. Biologics have
      accounted for the biggest change in recent years, and they are being used on a
      more regular basis, on more indications and at earlier stages. However, primary
      response failure and, above all, secondary response failure and cost represent
      serious limitations for their use. Combination immunosuppressant therapy,
      individualization depending on levels and response, increasing compliance and a
      more suitable choice of cases can all enhance effectiveness. However in many
      cases, new alternatives will be necessary. Recently, 2 new antibodies have been
      approved: golimumab is a new option for ulcerative colitis and with another more 
      selective mechanism of action; vedolizumab could be useful for ulcerative colitis
      as well as Crohn's disease. Ustekinumab is an alternative treatment option for
      refractory Crohn's disease. In addition to biologics, autologous bone marrow
      transplants and, anecdotally, the use of immunoglobulins have been suggested as
      alternatives in some carefully selected cases. Although effective for Clostridium
      difficile infection, the potential role of fecal transplants in inflammatory
      bowel disease is still to be determined, without initially observing very
      promising results. The use of probiotics has not produced significant positive
      results.

TI  - Lactobacillus helveticus SBT2171 inhibits lymphocyte proliferation by regulation 
      of the JNK signaling pathway.
PG  - e108360
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0108360 [doi]
AB  - Lactobacillus helveticus SBT2171 (LH2171) is a lactic acid bacterium with high
      protease activity and used in starter cultures in the manufacture of cheese. We
      recently reported that consumption of cheese manufactured using LH2171 alleviated
      symptoms of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. In this study, 
      we have examined whether LH2171 itself exerts an inhibitory effect on the
      excessive proliferation of lymphocytes. We found that LH2171 inhibited the
      proliferation of LPS-stimulated mouse T and B cells, and the human lymphoma cell 
      lines, Jurkat and BJAB. Cell cycle analysis showed an accumulation of
      LH2171-treated BJAB cells in the G2/M phase. Further, phosphorylation of c-Jun
      N-terminal kinase (JNK) and c-Jun was reduced by LH2171 in BJAB cells.
      Subsequently, expression of cell division cycle 2 (CDC2), regulated by the JNK
      signaling pathway and essential for G2/M phase progression, was inhibited by
      LH2171. It was also demonstrated that intraperitoneal administration of LH2171

AB  - While the role of microflora is well established in the development of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBS); data is still emerging regarding IBS as the
      knowledge on brain-gut interaction grows. For both patient groups multiple
      efficacious treatments exist, but there are still unmet needs as long term
      disease control remains an issue. Given the importance of the microbiome on the
      development of the immune system and the interaction between the microbiome and
      the host organism, this "route" is being examined increasingly as a therapeutic
      possibility in both pathologies with variable results. We here provide a short
      overview on the existing data, meta-analysis and single studies, on probiotic
      treatment in both diseases.

TI  - Antibiotics, probiotics and prebiotics in IBD.
PG  - 83-100
LID - 10.1159/000360713 [doi]
AB  - The dysbiosis theory of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) posits that there is an 
      alteration in the gut microbiome as an important underpinning of disease
      etiology. It stands to reason then, that administering agents that could impact
      on the balance of microbes on the gut could be impactful on the course of IBD.
      Herein is a review of the controlled trials undertaken to assess the use of
      antibiotics that would kill or suppress potentially injurious microbes,
      probiotics that would overpopulate the gut with potentially beneficial microbes
      or prebiotics that provide a metabolic substrate that enhances the growth of
      potentially beneficial microbes. With regard to antibiotics, the best data are
      for the use of nitroimadoles postoperatively in Crohn's disease (CD) to prevent
      disease recurrence. Otherwise, the data are limited with the regard to any
      lasting benefit of antibiotics sustaining remission in either CD or ulcerative
      colitis (UC). A recent meta-analysis concluded that antibiotics are superior to
      placebo at inducing remission in CD or UC, although the meta-analysis grouped a
      variety of antibiotics with different spectra of activity. Despite the absence of
      robust clinical trial data, antibiotics are widely used to treat perineal
      fistulizing CD and acute and chronic pouchitis. Probiotics have not been shown to
      have a beneficial role in CD. However, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 has
      comparable effects to low doses of mesalamine in maintaining remission in UC.
      VSL#3, a combination of 8 microbes, has been shown to have an effect in inducing 
      remission in UC and preventing pouchitis. Prebiotics have yet to be shown to have
      an effect in any form of IBD, but to date controlled trials have been small. The 
      use of antibiotics should be balanced against the risks they pose. Even
      probiotics may pose some risk and should not be assumed to be innocuous
      especially when ingested by persons with a compromised epithelial barrier.
      Prebiotics may not be harmful but may cause gastrointestinal side effects.
      Finally, the timing of ingestion of antibiotics and other dietary factors that
      may function as prebiotics, especially in early childhood, may be critical in
      shaping the gut microbiome and ultimately predisposing to or preventing IBD.
      Finding ways to impact on the gut microbiome to alter the course of IBD makes
      good sense, but should be undertaken in the setting of rigorously performed
      controlled trials to ensure that the interventions are truly effective and well
      tolerated.

AB  - Abundant clinical and experimental evidence supports a role for resident
      microbiota in Crohn's disease and pouchitis, and probably in ulcerative colitis
      (UC). These disorders occur in areas of highest bacterial concentrations.
      Pouchitis and Crohn's colitis respond to antibiotics, while pouchitis and UC can 
      be treated with probiotics. Serologic markers recognizing intestinal bacteria and
      yeast are present in the majority of Crohn's disease patients and may predict
      disease aggressiveness. Abnormal profiles of fecal and mucosally associated
      enteric bacteria (dysbiosis) occur in Crohn's disease, UC, pouchitis and
      experimental enterocolitis, with a proliferation of aggressive species that
      promote experimental colitis and a corresponding decrease in protective bacterial
      subsets. Many of these protective bacteria produce short-chain fatty acids,
      including butyrate, that promote epithelial barrier function, inhibit effector
      immune responses and induce regulatory T cell subsets. Furthermore, certain
      Clostridia species stimulate regulatory T cells that can inhibit intestinal
      inflammation. Animal models of chronic, immune-mediated enterocolitis
      convincingly demonstrate that enteric resident bacteria stimulate effector immune
      cells in susceptible hosts and that a subset of enteric bacteria has particularly
      aggressive activities, with host and bacterial specificity. Recent studies
      suggest parallel and perhaps complementary roles for enteric viruses, which have 
      only very recently been identified.

TI  - Intestinal microbiota, probiotics and prebiotics in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 11505-24
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i33.11505 [doi]
AB  - It has been presumed that aberrant immune response to intestinal microorganisms
      in genetically predisposed individuals may play a major role in the pathogenesis 
      of the inflammatory bowel disease, and there is a good deal of evidence
      supporting this hypothesis. Commensal enteric bacteria probably play a central
      role in pathogenesis, providing continuous antigenic stimulation that causes
      chronic intestinal injury. A strong biologic rationale supports the use of
      probiotics and prebiotics for inflammatory bowel disease therapy. Many probiotic 
      strains exhibit anti-inflammatory properties through their effects on different
      immune cells, pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion depression, and the induction
      of anti-inflammatory cytokines. There is very strong evidence supporting the use 
      of multispecies probiotic VSL#3 for the prevention or recurrence of postoperative
      pouchitis in patients. For treatment of active ulcerative colitis, as well as for
      maintenance therapy, the clinical evidence of efficacy is strongest for VSL#3 and
      Escherichia coli Nissle 1917. Moreover, some prebiotics, such as germinated
      barley foodstuff, Psyllium or oligofructose-enriched inulin, might provide some
      benefit in patients with active ulcerative colitis or ulcerative colitis in
      remission. The results of clinical trials in the treatment of active Crohn's
      disease or the maintenance of its remission with probiotics and prebiotics are
      disappointing and do not support their use in this disease. The only exception is
      weak evidence of advantageous use of Saccharomyces boulardii concomitantly with
      medical therapy in maintenance treatment.

TI  - Non-pulmonary allergic diseases and inflammatory bowel disease: a qualitative
      review.
PG  - 11023-32
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i32.11023 [doi]
AB  - While the etiological underpinnings of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are
      highly complex, it has been noted that both clinical and pathophysiological
      similarities exist between IBD and both asthma and non-pulmonary allergic
      phenomena. In this review, several key points on common biomarkers,
      pathophysiology, clinical manifestations and nutritional and probiotic
      interventions for both IBD and non-pulmonary allergic diseases are discussed.
      Histamine and mast cell activity show common behaviors in both IBD and in certain
      allergic disorders. IgE also represents a key immunoglobulin involved in both IBD
      and in certain allergic pathologies, though these links require further study.
      Probiotics remain a critically important intervention for both IBD subtypes as
      well as multiple allergic phenomena. Linked clinical phenomena, especially
      sinonasal disease and IBD, are discussed. In addition, nutritional interventions 
      remain an underutilized and promising therapy for modification of both allergic
      disorders and IBD. Recommending new mothers breastfeed their infants, and
      increasing the duration of breastfeeding may also help prevent both IBD and
      allergic diseases, but requires more investigation. While much remains to be
      discovered, it is clear that non-pulmonary allergic phenomena are connected to
      IBD in a myriad number of ways and that the discovery of common immunological
      pathways may usher in an era of vastly improved treatments for patients.

TI  - Gut microbiota and inflammatory bowel disease: the role of antibiotics in disease
      management.
PG  - 7-19
LID - 10.3810/pgm.2014.07.2779 [doi]
AB  - Imbalances in the composition and number of bacteria in the gut microbiota have
      been implicated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and modulation of the gut
      microbiota by probiotics and antibiotics in IBD has been an active area of
      research, with mixed results. This narrative review summarizes the findings of
      relevant publications identified using the PubMed database. Although antibiotics 
      have been associated with an increased risk of IBD development and flares,
      several meta-analyses demonstrate that antibiotics are efficacious for the
      induction of remission and treatment of flares in patients with IBD. Data
      supporting their use include a large number of antibiotic studies in Crohn's
      disease and evidence suggests antibiotics are efficacious in both Crohn's disease
      and ulcerative colitis, although there are fewer studies of the latter. For
      Crohn's disease, antibiotics have been shown to be useful for the induction of
      remission and in the postoperative management of patients undergoing surgery.
      Additionally, patients with fistulizing disease, particularly perianal, can
      benefit from antibiotics administered short term. Both antimicrobials and
      probiotics have been shown to be useful for the treatment of pouchitis.
      Additional randomized controlled trials are needed to further elucidate the role 
      of bacteria in IBD and to better inform clinicians about appropriate antibiotic
      therapies.

      mucus barrier.
PG  - 9468-75
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i28.9468 [doi]
AB  - To reduce medication for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), we need to
      establish the etiology of UC. The intestinal microbiota of patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been shown to differ from that of healthy
      controls and abundant data indicate that it changes in both composition and
      localization. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is significantly higher in
      IBD patients compared with controls. Probiotics have been investigated for their 
      capacity to reduce the severity of UC. The luminal surfaces of the
      gastrointestinal tract are covered by a mucus layer. This normally acts as a
      barrier that does not allow bacteria to reach the epithelial cells and thus
      limits the direct contact between the host and the bacteria. The mucus layer in
      the colon comprises an inner layer that is firmly adherent to the intestinal
      mucosa, and an outer layer that can be washed off with minimal rinsing. Some
      bacteria can dissolve the protective inner mucus layer. Defects in renewal and
      formation of the inner mucus layer allow bacteria to reach the epithelium and
      have implications for the causes of colitis. In this review, important elements
      of UC pathology are thought to be the intestinal bacteria, gut mucus, and the
      mucosa-associated immune system.

      an indigenous probiotic strain of Lactobacillus fermentum Lf1.
PG  - 206732
LID - 10.1155/2014/206732 [doi]
AB  - Based on the preliminary screening of eight indigenous putative probiotic
      Lactobacilli, Lactobacillus fermentum Lf1 was selected for assessing its
      antioxidative efficacy in DSS colitis mouse model based on its ability to enhance
      the expression of "Nrf2" by 6.43-fold and malondialdehyde (MDA) inhibition by
      78.1 +/- 0.24% in HT-29 cells under H2O2 stress. The Disease Activity Index and
      histological scores of Lf1-treated mice were lower than the control group.
      However, expression of "Nrf2" was not observed in Lf1-treated mice. A significant
      increase in the expression of antioxidative enzymes such as SOD2 and TrxR-1 was
      recorded in both of the groups. The expression of SOD2 was significantly
      downregulated in colitis-induced mice by -100.00-fold relative to control group, 
      and the downregulation was considerably reduced to -37.04-fold in colitis Lf1
      treatment group. Almost, a similar trend was recorded in case of "thioredoxin"
      expression, though "CAT" was refractile to expression. The Lf1-treated group had 
      decreased malondialdehyde level as compared to colitis control (37.92 +/- 6.31
      versus 91.13 +/- 5.76 muM/g). These results point towards Lf1-induced activation 
      of the antioxidant enzyme system in the mouse model and its prospects to be
      explored as a new strategy for IBD management.

TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus attenuates downregulation of DRA function and
      expression in inflammatory models.
PG  - G623-31
LID - 10.1152/ajpgi.00104.2014 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics, including Lactobacilli, are commensal bacteria that have been used in
      clinical trials and experimental models for the prevention and treatment of
      diarrheal disorders. Our previous studies have shown that Lactobacillus
      acidophilus (LA) and its culture supernatant (CS) stimulated Cl(-)/HCO3 (-)
      exchange activity, acutely via an increase in the surface levels of downregulated
      in adenoma (DRA, SLC26A3) and in long-term treatments via increasing its
      expression involving transcriptional mechanisms. However, the role of LA in
      modulating DRA activity under inflammatory conditions is not known. Current in
      vitro studies using human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells examined the
      efficacy of LA or its CS in counteracting the inhibitory effects of
      interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) on Cl(-)/HCO3 (-) exchange activity. Pretreatment of
      cells with LA or LA-CS for 1 h followed by coincubation with IFN-gamma
      significantly alleviated the inhibitory effects of IFN-gamma on Cl(-)/HCO3 (-)
      exchange activity. In the in vivo model of dextran sulfate sodium-induced
      experimental colitis (3% in drinking water for 7 days) in C57BL/6J mice,
      administration of live LA (3 x 10(9) colony-forming units) via oral gavage
      attenuated colonic inflammation. LA administration also counteracted the
      colitis-induced decrease in DRA mRNA and protein levels. Efficacy of LA or its
      secreted soluble factors in alleviating inflammation and inflammation-associated 
      dysregulation of DRA activity could justify their therapeutic potential in
      inflammatory diarrheal diseases.

TI  - Role of intestinal bacteria in the pathogenesis of pouchitis.
PG  - 1481-6
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000055 [doi]
AB  - Pouchitis is a common complication seen in patients with ulcerative colitis who
      undergo total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis. Bacteria seem to
      play an important role in the development of pouchitis, although this role is not
      well defined. Because technology has advanced, we are able to apply molecular
      techniques to describe the structure and function of the pouch microbial
      community. In recent years, several studies have been performed comparing the
      pouch microbiota in patients with ulcerative colitis with healthy pouches and
      pouchitis. Many of these studies have suggested that pouchitis is characterized
      by dysbiosis and/or decreased microbial diversity. There has not been a clear
      pattern identifying a pathogenic organism or a group of organisms responsible for
      pouchitis. This review summarizes recent studies exploring the pouch microbiota
      in health and disease, the relationship of bacterial metabolites and pouchitis,
      and the role of antibiotics and probiotics for the treatment and prevention of
      pouchitis.

TI  - Diet, microbiota, and inflammatory bowel disease: lessons from Japanese foods.
PG  - 409-15
LID - 10.3904/kjim.2014.29.4.409 [doi]
AB  - The incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) including
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease are rapidly increasing in Western countries 
      and in developed Asian countries. Although biologic agents targeting the immune
      system have been effective in patients with IBD, cessation of treatment leads to 
      relapse in the majority of patients, suggesting that intrinsic immune
      dysregulation is an effect, not a cause, of IBD. Dramatic changes in the
      environment, resulting in the dysregulated composition of intestinal microbiota
      or dysbiosis, may be associated with the fundamental causes of IBD. Japan now has
      upgraded water supply and sewerage systems, as well as dietary habits and
      antibiotic overuse that are similar to such features found in developed Western
      countries. The purpose of this review article was to describe the association of 
      diet, particularly Japanese food and microbiota, with IBD.

TI  - Microscopic colitis: a review.
PG  - 957-64
LID - 10.1111/codi.12716 [doi]
AB  - AIM: In recent years, microscopic colitis has been increasingly diagnosed. This
      review was carried out to evaluate demographic factors for microscopic colitis
      and to perform a systematic assessment of available treatment options. METHOD:
      Relevant publications up to December 2013 were identified following searches of
      PubMed and Google Scholar using the key words 'microscopic colitis', 'collagenous
      colitis' and 'lymphocytic colitis'. Two-hundred and forty-eight articles were
      identified. RESULTS: The term microscopic colitis includes lymphocytic colitis
      and collagenous colitis. Both have common clinical symptoms but are well defined 
      histopathologically. The clinical course is usually benign, but serious
      complications, including death, may occur. A peak incidence from 60 to 70 years
      of age with a female preponderance is observed. Although most cases are
      idiopathic, associations with autoimmune disorders, such as coeliac disease and
      hypothyroidism, as well as with exposure to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
      and proton-pump inhibitors, have been observed. The incidence and prevalence of
      microscopic colitis is rising and good-quality epidemiological research is
      needed. Treatment is currently largely based on anecdotal evidence and on results
      from limited clinical trials of budesonide. Long-term follow-up of these patients
      is not well established. CONCLUSION: The review synthesizes work on the
      definition of microscopic colitis and the relationship between collagenous and
      lymphocytic colitis. It reviews the international epidemiology and work on
      aetiology. In addition, it critically considers the efficacy of a range of
      treatments.

TI  - Lactobacillus casei and bifidobacterium lactis supplementation reduces tissue
      damage of intestinal mucosa and liver after 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid
      treatment in mice.
PG  - 251-61
AB  - Probiotics (PB) are living microorganisms that act as a commensal population in
      normal intestines and confer numerous beneficial effects on the host. The
      introduction of probiotics in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      prolongs remission. The aim of this study was to investigate the intestinal and
      hepatic effects of PB supplementation in an experimental IBD model in mice
      induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). In the first step of the
      experimental procedure, CD-1 male mice, 5 to 6 weeks old, were randomly divided
      into 3 groups and inoculated intrarectally with, respectively, saline, alcohol,
      or TNBS to assess the experimental IBD model. In the second step, mice treated,
      or not, with TNBS inoculation, were treated with PB (Lactobacillus Casei,
      Bifidobacterum Lactis) for 1, 2 or 3 weeks, on a daily basis. Large bowel (colon 
      and rectum) and liver were processed for histological alterations, according to a
      scoring system. Large bowel was also assessed for apoptosis by TUNEL assay. TNBS 
      induced, as expected, severe damage and inflammation in the large bowel,
      including nuclear alterations and apoptosis, and, to a lesser extent, to the
      liver. Administration of PB determined significant reduction of both histological
      alterations and apoptosis. PB administration in advance protects from
      inflammation. In conclusion, supplementation with Lactobacillus casei,
      Bifidobacterum lactis PB is able to ameliorate the colitis by reversing the
      histological changes caused by TNBS in mice. Experimentation in human subjects in
      needed to prove their efficacy in reducing histological alterations that may be
      present in subjects with IBD.

TI  - Association of levels of antibodies from patients with inflammatory bowel disease
      with extracellular proteins of food and probiotic bacteria.
PG  - 351204
LID - 10.1155/2014/351204 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an autoimmune disease characterized by a
      chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract mucosa and is related to an
      abnormal immune response to commensal bacteria. Our aim of the present work has
      been to explore the levels of antibodies (IgG and IgA) raised against
      extracellular proteins produced by LAB and its association with IBD. We analyzed,
      by Western-blot and ELISA, the presence of serum antibodies (IgA and IgG)
      developed against extracellular protein fractions produced by different food
      bacteria from the genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. We used a sera
      collection consisting of healthy individuals (HC, n = 50), Crohn's disease
      patients (CD, n = 37), and ulcerative colitis patients (UC, n = 15). Levels of
      IgA antibodies developed against a cell-wall hydrolase from Lactobacillus casei
      subsp. rhamnosus GG (CWH) were significantly higher in the IBD group (P < 0.002; 
      n = 52). The specificity of our measurements was confirmed by measuring IgA
      antibodies developed against the CWH peptide 365-VNTSNQTAAVSAS-377. IBD patients 
      appeared to have different immune response to food bacteria. This paper sets the 
      basis for developing systems for early detection of IBD, based on the association
      of high levels of antibodies developed against extracellular proteins from food
      and probiotic bacteria.

TI  - Lactobacillus rhamnosus L34 and Lactobacillus casei L39 suppress Clostridium
      difficile-induced IL-8 production by colonic epithelial cells.
PG  - 177
LID - 10.1186/1471-2180-14-177 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile is the main cause of hospital-acquired diarrhea
      and colitis known as C. difficile-associated disease (CDAD).With increased
      severity and failure of treatment in CDAD, new approaches for prevention and
      treatment, such as the use of probiotics, are needed. Since the pathogenesis of
      CDAD involves an inflammatory response with a massive influx of neutrophils
      recruited by interleukin (IL)-8, this study aimed to investigate the probiotic
      effects of Lactobacillus spp. on the suppression of IL-8 production in response
      to C. difficile infection. RESULTS: We screened Lactobacillus conditioned media
      from 34 infant fecal isolates for the ability to suppress C. difficile-induced
      IL-8 production from HT-29 cells. Factors produced by two vancomycin-resistant
      lactobacilli, L. rhamnosus L34 (LR-L34) and L.casei L39 (LC-L39), suppressed the 
      secretion and transcription of IL-8 without inhibiting C. difficile viability or 
      toxin production. Conditioned media from LR-L34 suppressed the activation of
      phospho-NF-kappaB with no effect on phospho-c-Jun. However, LC-L39 conditioned
      media suppressed the activation of both phospho-NF-kappaB and phospho-c-Jun.
      Conditioned media from LR-L34 and LC-L39 also decreased the production of C.
      difficile-induced GM-CSF in HT-29 cells. Immunomodulatory factors present in the 
      conditioned media of both LR-L34 and LC-L39 are heat-stable up to 100 degrees C
      and > 100 kDa in size. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that L. rhamnosus L34 and
      L. casei L39 each produce factors capable of modulating inflammation stimulated
      by C. difficile. These vancomycin-resistant Lactobacillus strains are potential
      probiotics for treating or preventing CDAD.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel
      disease. The probiotic bacterium Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) has been used
      to maintain and induce clinical remission in UC. Our aim was to test the effect
      of Ciprofloxacin and/or orally administered EcN as add-on to conventional
      therapies in patients with active UC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our single center
      double-blinded randomized placebo controlled study included patients with a
      Colitis Activity Index (CAI) score of at least 6. Patients were randomized to
      Ciprofloxacin or placebo for 1week followed by EcN or placebo for 7weeks. All 4
      treatments were given as add-on treatments. RESULTS: One hundred subjects with
      active UC were recruited. In the per-protocol analysis we, surprisingly, found
      that in the group receiving placebo/EcN fewer patients, 54%, reached remission
      compared to the group receiving placebo/placebo, 89%, p<0.05. Among patients
      treated with Cipro/placebo and Cipro/EcN, 78% and 66% reached remission,
      respectively. Furthermore, the group receiving placebo/EcN had the largest number
      of withdrawals, 11 of 25 (44%), compared to 15 of 75 (20%) in any of the other
      groups, p<0.05. Indication of lack of mucosal healing was found in the group
      treated with placebo/Nissle, since only 4 (29%) of the 14 patients, who completed
      the study, reported no blood in stools at week 12 (p<0.02), compared to 63%, 67% 
      and 65% in groups treated with Cipro/Nissle, Cipro/placebo and placebo/placebo,
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that there is no benefit in the use
      of E. coli Nissle as an add-on treatment to conventional therapies for active
      ulcerative colitis. Furthermore, treatment with E. coli Nissle without a previous
      antibiotic cure resulted in fewer patients reaching clinical remission.

TI  - Modulating the microbiota in inflammatory bowel diseases: prebiotics, probiotics 
      or faecal transplantation?
PG  - 490-7
LID - 10.1017/S0029665114000639 [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are the two major phenotypes of 
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) which constitute a spectrum of chronic,
      debilitating diseases characterised by a relapsing inflammation of the intestinal
      mucosal lining. Evidence from a variety of disciplines implicates the intestinal 
      microbiota in the pathogenesis of idiopathic IBD and their complications,
      including pouchitis. Many studies have reported a dysbiosis in IBD, characterised
      by a decrease in diversity, a decreased abundance of some dominant commensal
      members (such as Clostridium IV and XIVa) and an increase in detrimental bacteria
      (such as sulphate reducing bacteria and Escherichia coli). Therapies such as
      prebiotics and probiotics aim to selectively manipulate the intestinal microbiota
      and have been evaluated as an attractive therapeutic option with few side
      effects. The multispecies product VSL#3 was found effective in preventing and
      maintaining remission in pouchitis, whereas both VSL#3 and E. coli Nissle were
      effective in maintaining remission in UC. A more drastic approach to restore the 
      composition of the microbiota and correct the underlying imbalance is a faecal
      microbiota transplantation (FMT). FMT has been successfully applied to treat
      patients with even recalcitrant Clostridium difficile infection. Particularly in 
      UC, the majority of studies suggest that FMT may be an effective treatment option
      although the evidence is still limited. It is anticipated that our increasing
      knowledge on the composition and function of the intestinal microbiota components
      will allow in the future for a better selection of highly performing bacteria
      with specific functions required for specific benefits.

LID - 10.1021/ja503450q [doi]
AB  - The gene cluster responsible for synthesis of the unknown molecule "colibactin"
      has been identified in mutualistic and pathogenic Escherichia coli. The pathway
      endows its producer with a long-term persistence phenotype in the human bowel, a 
      probiotic activity used in the treatment of ulcerative colitis, and a
      carcinogenic activity under host inflammatory conditions. To date, functional
      small molecules from this pathway have not been reported. Here we implemented a
      comparative metabolomics and targeted structural network analyses approach to
      identify a catalog of small molecules dependent on the colibactin pathway from
      the meningitis isolate E. coli IHE3034 and the probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917. The
      structures of 10 pathway-dependent small molecules are proposed based on
      structural characterizations and network relationships. The network will provide 
      a roadmap for the structural and functional elucidation of a variety of other
      small molecules encoded by the pathway. From the characterized small molecule
      set, in vitro bacterial growth inhibitory and mammalian CNS receptor antagonist
      activities are presented.

TI  - [Saccharomyces boulardii in the treatment and prevention of antibiotic-associated
      diarrhea].
PG  - 18-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) is the most frequent side effect
      of antibiotic therapy. Clinical signs and symptoms comprise mild and
      self-limiting courses of diarrhea as well as life threatening courses like
      pseudomembranous colitis or toxic megacolon. Therapy is symptomatic,
      antidiarrheal drugs like Saccharomyces boulardii are the therapy of choice.
      METHOD: Available studies on S. boulardii in the prevention of AAD are presented 
      as a review. RESULTS: In 14 out of 17 studies including 4,627 patients the
      administration of S. boulardii achieved a protective effect between 43.7% and
      87.3%. A meta-analysis (5 studies, 1,076 patients) showed a significant reduction
      of the risk to develop an AAD from 17.2% to 6.7%,in a furthermeta-analysis (4
      studies on eradication of H. pylori, 1,215 patients) the significant
      reductionwasfrom 12.2% to 5.6%. CONCLUSIONS: There is very good evidence for the 
      yeast S. boulardii to be effective in the prevention of AAD especially in
      hospitalized adults. The simultaneous administration of S. boulardii to
      antibiotics resulted in a significant reduction to develop AAD by more than half.

TI  - Probiotic mix VSL#3 is effective adjunctive therapy for mild to moderately active
      ulcerative colitis: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 1562-7
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000084 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: VSL#3 is a probiotic mix preparation reported to be effective in the 
      treatment of mild to moderately active ulcerative colitis. We aimed to perform a 
      systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis of studies on its
      efficacy. METHODS: The searched databases included PubMed, Scopus, and
      ScienceDirect. The Mantel-Haenszel method was used to pool the effect- ize across
      studies, and the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of
      experiencing a specific outcome were calculated. RESULTS: Five studies with 441
      patients were identified. The pooled remission rate was 49.4% (95% CI,
      42.7-56.1). Only 3 low risk of bias studies with 319 patients met the inclusion
      criteria for further analysis. A total of 162 patients received 3.6 x 10 CFU/d
      VSL#3, and 157 patients received placebo. A total of 95% of patients received
      concomitant therapies with 5-ASA and/or immunomodulators. The Ulcerative Colitis 
      Disease Activity Index was used to define response and remission. A >50% decrease
      in the Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index was achieved in 44.6% of the
      VSL#3-treated patients versus 25.1% of the patients given placebo (P = 0008; OR, 
      2.793; 95% CI, 1.375-5.676; number needed to treat = 4-5). The response rate was 
      53.4% in VSL#3-treated patients versus 29.3% in patients given placebo (P < 0001;
      OR, 3.03; 95% CI, 1.89-4.83; number needed to treat = 3-4). The remission rate
      was 43.8% in VSL#3-treated patients versus 24.8% in patients given placebo (P =
      0007; OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.48-3.88; number needed to treat = 4-5). No serious side 
      effects were reported. CONCLUSIONS: VSL#3, when added to conventional therapy at 
      a daily dose of 3.6 x 10 CFU/d, is safe and more effective than conventional
      therapy alone in achieving higher response and remission rates in mild to
      moderately active ulcerative colitis.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) with its two major forms Crohn's disease (CD)
      and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic relapsing disorders leading to
      inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Although the precise aetiology of IBD
      remains unclear, several factors are believed to contribute to disease
      pathogenesis. Among these, the role of the intestinal microbiota has become more 
      and more appreciated. Evidence from experimental and clinical studies strongly
      suggests that chronic intestinal inflammation results from a dysregulated immune 
      response towards components of the microbiota in genetically susceptible hosts.
      The growing perception of the microbiota as a major driver of disease
      pathogenesis raises the question, if the intestinal microbiota can be used as a
      therapeutic target in CD. Based on what we know about host microbiota
      interactions in health and disease, the objective of this review is to address
      the question if the microbiota holds the key to the future therapy in CD.

      stimulated by p40, a Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG-derived protein.
PG  - 20234-44
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M114.553800 [doi]
AB  - The mucus layer coating the gastrointestinal tract serves as the first line of
      intestinal defense against infection and injury. Probiotics promote mucin
      production by goblet cells in the intestine. p40, a Lactobacillus rhamnosus
      GG-derived soluble protein, has been shown to transactivate the EGF receptor
      (EGFR) in intestinal epithelial cells, which is required for inhibition of
      apoptosis and preservation of barrier function in the colon, thereby ameliorating
      intestinal injury and colitis. Because activation of EGFR has been shown to
      up-regulate mucin production in goblet cells, the purpose of this study was to
      investigate the effects and mechanisms of p40 regulation of mucin production. p40
      activated EGFR and its downstream target, Akt, in a concentration-dependent
      manner in LS174T cells. p40 stimulated Muc2 gene expression and mucin production 
      in LS174T cells, which were abolished by inhibition of EGFR kinase activity,
      down-regulation of EGFR expression by EGFR siRNA transfection, or suppression of 
      Akt activation. Treatment with p40 increased mucin production in the colonic
      epithelium, thus thickening the mucus layer in the colon of wild type, but not of
      Egfr(wa5) mice, which have a dominant negative mutation in the EGFR kinase
      domain. Furthermore, inhibition of mucin-type O-linked glycosylation suppressed
      the effect of p40 on increasing mucin production and protecting intestinal
      epithelial cells from TNF-induced apoptosis in colon organ culture. Thus, these
      results suggest that p40-stimulated activation of EGFR mediates up-regulation of 
      mucin production, which may contribute to the mechanisms by which p40 protects
      the intestinal epithelium from injury.

AB  - Clostridium difficile is a spore-forming, toxin-producing, anaerobic bacterium
      that colonizes the human gastrointestinal tract. This pathogen causes
      antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis in animals and humans.
      Antibiotic-associated diseases may be treated with probiotics, and interest is
      increasing in such uses of probiotics. This study investigated the effect of
      Lactobacillus strains on the quorum-sensing signals and toxin production of C.
      difficile. In addition, an in vivo experiment was designed to assess whether
      Lactobacillus acidophilus GP1B is able to control C. difficile-associated
      disease. Autoinducer-2 activity was measured for C. difficile using the Vibrio
      harveyi coupled bioluminescent assay. Cell extract (10mug/mL) of L. acidophilus
      GP1B exhibited the highest inhibitory activity among 5 to 40mug/mL cell-extract
      concentrations. Real-time PCR data indicated decreased transcriptional levels in 
      luxS, tcdA, tcdB, and txeR genes in the presence of 10mug/mL of cell extract of
      L. acidophilus GP1B. Survival rates at 5d for mice given the pathogen alone with 
      L. acidophilus GP1B cell extract or L. acidophilus GP1B were 10, 70, and 80%,
      respectively. In addition, the lactic acid-produced L. acidophilus GP1B exhibits 
      an inhibitory effect against the growth of C. difficile. Both the L. acidophilus 
      GP1B and GP1B cell extract have significant antipathogenic effects on C.
      difficile.

TI  - Treatment of abdominal pain in irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 1193-205
LID - 10.1007/s00535-014-0966-7 [doi]
AB  - Functional abdominal pain in the context of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a
      challenging problem for primary care physicians, gastroenterologists and pain
      specialists. We review the evidence for the current and future
      non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment options targeting the central
      nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. Cognitive interventions such as
      cognitive behavioral therapy and hypnotherapy have demonstrated excellent results
      in IBS patients, but the limited availability and labor-intensive nature limit
      their routine use in daily practice. In patients who are refractory to first-line
      therapy, tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) and selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors are both effective to obtain symptomatic relief, but only TCAs have
      been shown to improve abdominal pain in meta-analyses. A diet low in fermentable 
      carbohydrates and polyols (FODMAP) seems effective in subgroups of patients to
      reduce abdominal pain, bloating, and to improve the stool pattern. The evidence
      for fiber is limited and only isphagula may be somewhat beneficial. The efficacy 
      of probiotics is difficult to interpret since several strains in different
      quantities have been used across studies. Antispasmodics, including peppermint
      oil, are still considered the first-line treatment for abdominal pain in IBS.
      Second-line therapies for diarrhea-predominant IBS include the non-absorbable
      antibiotic rifaximin and the 5HT3 antagonists alosetron and ramosetron, although 
      the use of the former is restricted because of the rare risk of ischemic colitis.
      In laxative-resistant, constipation-predominant IBS, the chloride-secretion
      stimulating drugs lubiprostone and linaclotide, a guanylate cyclase C agonist
      that also has direct analgesic effects, reduce abdominal pain and improve the
      stool pattern.

AB  - While some probiotics have shown beneficial effects on preventing or treating
      colitis development, others have shown no effects. In this study, we have
      assessed the immunomodulating effects of two probiotic strains, Lactobacillus
      rhamnosus (L. rhamnosus) and Bifidobacterium breve (B. breve) on T cell
      polarization in vitro, using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and
      in vivo, using murine dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) colitis model. With respect to
      the latter, the mRNA expression of T cell subset-associated transcription factors
      and cytokines in the colon was measured and the T helper type (Th) 17 and
      regulatory T cell (Treg) subsets were determined in the Peyer's patches. Both L. 
      rhamnosus and B. breve incubations in vitro reduced Th17 and increased Th2 cell
      subsets in human PBMCs. In addition, B. breve incubation was also able to reduce 
      Th1 and increase Treg cell subsets in contrast to L. rhamnosus. In vivo
      intervention with B. breve, but not L. rhamnosus, significantly attenuated the
      severity of DSS-induced colitis. In DSS-treated C57BL/6 mice, intervention with
      B. breve increased the expression of mRNA encoding for Th2- and Treg-associated
      cytokines in the distal colon. In addition, intervention with B. breve led to
      increases of Treg and decreases of Th17 cell subsets in Peyer's patches of
      DSS-treated mice. B. breve modulates T cell polarization towards Th2 and Treg
      cell-associated responses in vitro and in vivo. In vivo B. breve intervention
      ameliorates DSS-induced colitis symptoms and this protective effect may mediated 
      by its effects on the T-cell composition.

AB  - AIM: To investigate the protective effects of combinations of probiotic (Bifico) 
      on interleukin (IL)-10-gene-deficient (IL-10 KO) mice and Caco-2 cell monolayers.
      METHODS: IL-10 KO mice were used to assess the benefits of Bifico in vivo. IL-10 
      KO and control mice received approximately 1.5 x 10(8) cfu/d of Bifico for 4 wk. 
      Colons were then removed and analyzed for epithelial barrier function by Ussing
      Chamber, while an ELISA was used to evaluate proinflammatory cytokines. The colon
      epithelial cell line, Caco-2, was used to test the benefit of Bifico in vitro.
      Enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC) and the probiotic mixture Bifico, or
      single probiotic strains, were applied to cultured Caco-2 monolayers. Barrier
      function was determined by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance and
      tight junction protein expression. RESULTS: Treatment of IL-10 KO mice with
      Bifico partially restored body weight, colon length, and epithelial barrier
      integrity to wild-type levels. In addition, IL-10 KO mice receiving Bifico
      treatment had reduced mucosal secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and
      interferon-gamma, and attenuated colonic disease. Moreover, treatment of Caco-2
      monolayers with Bifico or single-strain probiotics in vitro inhibited EIEC
      invasion and reduced the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. CONCLUSION:
      Bifico reduced colon inflammation in IL-10 KO mice, and promoted and improved
      epithelial-barrier function, enhanced resistance to EIEC invasion, and decreased 
      proinflammatory cytokine secretion.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Clinical management of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD),
      new treatment modalities and the potential impact of personalised medicine remain
      topics of intense interest as our understanding of the pathophysiology of IBD
      expands. METHODS: Potential future strategies for IBD management are discussed,
      based on recent preclinical and clinical research. RESULTS: A top-down approach
      to medical therapy is increasingly being adopted for patients with risk factors
      for severe inflammation or an unfavourable disease course in an attempt to halt
      the inflammatory process as early as possible, prevent complications and induce
      mucosal healing. In the future, biological therapies for IBD are likely to be
      used more selectively based on personalised benefit/risk assessment, determined
      through reliable biomarkers and tissue signatures, and will probably be optimised
      throughout the course of treatment. Biologics with different mechanisms of action
      will be available; when one drug fails, patients will be able to switch to
      another and even combination biologics may become a reality. The role of
      biotherapeutic products that are similar to currently licensed biologics in terms
      of quality, safety and efficacy - i.e. biosimilars - is at an early stage and
      requires further experience. Other therapeutic strategies may involve
      manipulation of the microbiome using antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, diet
      and combinations of all these approaches. Faecal microbiota transplantation is
      also a potential option in IBD although controlled data are lacking. CONCLUSIONS:
      The future of classifying, prognosticating and managing IBD involves an
      outcomes-based approach to identify biomarkers reflecting various biological
      processes that can be matched with clinically important endpoints.

TI  - Effects in the use of a genetically engineered strain of Lactococcus lactis
      delivering in situ IL-10 as a therapy to treat low-grade colon inflammation.
PG  - 1611-21
LID - 10.4161/hv.28549 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a gastrointestinal disorder characterized by
      chronic abdominal pain, discomfort, and bloating. Interestingly, there is now
      evidence of the presence of a low-grade inflammatory status in many IBS patients,
      including histopathological and mucosal cytokine levels in the colon, as well as 
      the presence of IBS-like symptoms in quiescent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 
      The use of a genetically engineered food-grade bacterium, such as Lactococcus
      lactis, secreting the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 has been proven by many
      pre-clinical studies to be a successful therapy to treat colon inflammation. In
      this study, we first reproduced the recovery-recurrence periods observed in
      IBS-patients in a new chronic model characterized by 2 episodes of
      DiNitro-BenzeneSulfonic-acid (DNBS)-challenge and we tested the effects of a
      recombinant strain of L. lactis secreting IL-10 under a Stress-Inducible
      Controlled Expression (SICE) system. In vivo gut permeability, colonic serotonin 
      levels, cytokine profiles, and spleen cell populations were then measured as
      readouts of a low-grade inflammation. In addition, since there is increasing
      evidence that gut microbiota tightly regulates gut barrier function, tight
      junction proteins were also measured by qRT-PCR after administration of
      recombinant L. lactis in DNBS-treated mice. Strikingly, oral administration of L.
      lactis secreting active IL-10 in mice resulted in significant protective effects 
      in terms of permeability, immune activation, and gut-function parameters.
      Although genetically engineered bacteria are, for now, used only as a
      "proof-of-concept," our study validates the interest in the use of the novel SICE
      system in L. lactis to express therapeutic molecules, such as IL-10, locally at
      mucosal surfaces.

AB  - This is a consensus of the Austrian working group of IBD (inflammatory bowel
      diseases) of the OGGH on nutrition in IBD. Malnutrition should be assessed in
      case of IBD (in 20 - 70 % of Crohn's patients) and weight loss(> 5 % within 3
      months) or nutritional deficiencies or after extensive bowel resection and
      afterwards also treated. Malnutrition should be treated with medical therapy of
      IBD and also adequate - as far as possible - with oral nutritional therapy
      particularly because of reduced life quality, risk of opportunistic infections,
      osteopenia/osteoporosis, longer hospitalisations and higher mortality. Iron
      homeostasis, serum levels of Vitamin B12- and folic acid, 25-hydroxyvitamin D and
      zinc should be checked. Therapy with enteral liquid diets is only indicated as
      therapy of first choice in children and adolescents, but only in rare situations 
      in adults with IBD. There is - up to now - no proven oral diet for maintenance of
      remission in IBD. Probiotics as E. coli Nissle could be used as alternative to
      mesalazine for maintenance of remission in patients with ulcerative colitis. A
      specific dietary counselling is mandatory in patients with ileostoma or short
      bowel syndrome. Malnutrition of short bowel patients is particularly dependent on
      the function and length of the remaining bowel, therefore the most effective
      medical therapy should be administered.

AB  - Despite the advent of biological products, such as anti-tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha monoclonal antibodies (infliximab and adalimumab), for treatment of 
      moderate to severe cases of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), most patients
      depend upon aminosalicylates as the conventional treatment option. In recent
      years, the increased knowledge of complex pathophysiological processes underlying
      IBD has resulted in development of a number of newer pharmaceutical agents like
      low-molecular-weight heparin, omega-3 fatty acids, probiotics and innovative
      formulations such as high-dose, once-daily multi-matrix mesalamine, which are
      designed to minimize the inflammatory process through inhibition of different
      targets. Optimization of delivery of existing drugs to the colon using the
      prodrug approach is another attractive alternative that has been utilized and
      commercialized for 5-aminosalicylic acid (ASA) in the form of sulfasalazine,
      balsalazide, olsalazine and ipsalazine, but rarely for its positional isomer
      4-ASA - a well-established antitubercular drug that is twice as potent as 5-ASA
      against IBD, and more specifically, ulcerative colitis. The present review
      focuses on the complete profile of 4-ASA and its advantages over 5-ASA and
      colon-targeting prodrugs reported so far for the management of IBD. The review
      also emphasizes the need for reappraisal of this promising but unexplored entity 
      as a potential treatment option for IBD.

TI  - Saccharomyces cerevisiae fungemia, a possible consequence of the treatment of
      Clostridium difficile colitis with a probioticum.
PG  - 143-6
AB  - The yeast Saccharomyces boulardii is a biotherapeutic agent used for the
      prevention and treatment of several gastrointestinal diseases, such as diarrhoea 
      caused by Clostridium difficile, in addition to the antibiotic therapy. In this
      study we report a case of Saccharomyces cerevisiae fungemia in a patient with
      Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD) treated orally with S.
      boulardii in association with vancomycin. The identification of the S. cerevisiae
      was confirmed by molecular technique. Fungemia is a rare, but a serious
      complication to treatment with probiotics. We believe it is important to remind
      the clinicians of this risk when prescribing probiotics, especially to
      immunocompromised patients.

AB  - The gut microbiota plays important roles in the development of the host immune
      system. We have previously shown that a combination of 46 strains of commensal
      Clostridia isolated from conventionally reared mice can induce the accumulation
      of CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells in the mouse colonic lamina propria. 
      Subsequently, we succeeded in isolating and selecting 17 strains of Clostridia
      from a healthy human fecal sample that can significantly increase the number and 
      function of colonic Treg cells in colonized rodents, thereby attenuating symptoms
      of experimental allergic diarrhea and colitis. Here we characterize each of the
      17 strains of human-derived Clostridia in terms of sensitivity to antibiotics and
      ability to produce short chain fatty acids and other metabolites, and discuss
      their potential as biotherapeutics to correct dysbiosis and treat
      immune-inflammatory diseases.

      we learnt in the past 10 years?
PG  - 1192-210
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i5.1192 [doi]
AB  - Our understanding of the microbial involvement in inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) pathogenesis has increased exponentially over the past decade. The
      development of newer molecular tools for the global assessment of the gut
      microbiome and the identification of nucleotide-binding oligomerization
      domain-containing protein 2 in 2001 and other susceptibility genes for Crohn's
      disease in particular has led to better understanding of the aetiopathogenesis of
      IBD. The microbial studies have elaborated the normal composition of the gut
      microbiome and its perturbations in the setting of IBD. This altered microbiome
      or "dysbiosis" is a key player in the protracted course of inflammation in IBD.
      Numerous genome-wide association studies have identified further genes involved
      in gastrointestinal innate immunity (including polymorphisms in genes involved in
      autophagy: ATG16L1 and IGRM), which have helped elucidate the relationship of the
      local innate immunity with the adjacent luminal bacteria. These developments have
      also spurred the search for specific pathogens which may have a role in the
      metamorphosis of the gut microbiome from a symbiotic entity to a putative
      pathogenic one. Here we review advances in our understanding of microbial
      involvement in IBD pathogenesis over the past 10 years and offer insight into how
      this will shape our therapeutic management of the disease in the coming years.

AB  - Studies of the roles of microbial communities in the development of inflammatory 
      bowel disease (IBD) have reached an important milestone. A decade of genome-wide 
      association studies and other genetic analyses have linked IBD with loci that
      implicate an aberrant immune response to the intestinal microbiota. More
      recently, profiling studies of the intestinal microbiome have associated the
      pathogenesis of IBD with characteristic shifts in the composition of the
      intestinal microbiota, reinforcing the view that IBD results from altered
      interactions between intestinal microbes and the mucosal immune system. Enhanced 
      technologies can increase our understanding of the interactions between the host 
      and its resident microbiota and their respective roles in IBD from both a
      large-scale pathway view and at the metabolic level. We review important
      microbiome studies of patients with IBD and describe what we have learned about
      the mechanisms of intestinal microbiota dysfunction. We describe the recent
      progress in microbiome research from exploratory 16S-based studies, reporting
      associations of specific organisms with a disease, to more recent studies that
      have taken a more nuanced view, addressing the function of the microbiota by
      metagenomic and metabolomic methods. Finally, we propose study designs and
      methodologies for future investigations of the microbiome in patients with
      inflammatory gut and autoimmune diseases in general.

AB  - Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a promising therapy for Clostridium
      difficile infection (CDI). However, questions remain regarding efficacy and
      safety in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, as well as longitudinal
      stability of donor stool composition. This report describes an IBD patient with
      two CDIs 18 months apart, each successfully treated with FMT with no IBD flares
      or complications. Microbiome composition analysis of patient samples during each 
      infection revealed low-diversity microbiota patterns similar to those previously 
      described in non-IBD patients with CDI and active IBD alone. Samples taken after 
      each transplant demonstrated quick remodeling towards the donor's sample
      composition coinciding with symptom resolution. Of note, samples taken from the
      same donor 18 months apart reflected marked differences in microbiota abundances,
      suggesting that the use of single donors in FMT programs offers little benefit in
      ensuring predictability of donor stool composition over time. This report
      describes similar microbial composition patterns during CDI in IBD patients to
      those described previously in non-IBD patients, and supports FMT as safe and
      effective treatment for recurring CDI in this patient population.

TI  - Identification of a probiotic bacteria-derived activator of the aryl hydrocarbon 
      receptor that inhibits colitis.
PG  - 460-5
LID - 10.1038/icb.2014.2 [doi]
AB  - The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) recognizes environmental xenobiotics and is
      originally thought to be involved in the metabolism (detoxification) of the
      substances. Recently, AhR is highlighted as an important regulator of
      inflammation. Notably, accumulating evidence suggests that activation of the AhR 
      suppresses inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Therefore, non-toxic AhR
      activators become attractive drug candidates for IBD. This study identified
      1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (DHNA), a precursor of menaquinone (vitamin K2)
      abundantly produced by Propionibacterium freudenreichii ET-3 isolated from
      Swiss-type cheese, as an AhR activator. DHNA activated the AhR pathway in human
      intestinal epithelial cell line Caco2 cells and in the mouse intestine. Oral
      treatment of mice with DHNA induced anti-microbial proteins RegIIIbeta and gamma 
      in the intestine, altered intestinal microbial flora and inhibited dextran sodium
      sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis, which recapitulated the phenotypes of AhR
      activation in the gut. As DHNA is commercially available in Japan as a prebiotic 
      supplement without severe adverse effects, DHNA or its derivatives might become a
      promising drug candidate for IBD via AhR activation. The results also implicate
      that intestinal AhR might act not only as a sensor for xenobiotics in diet and
      water but also for commensal bacterial activity because DHNA is a precursor of
      vitamin K2 produced by vitamin K2-synthesizing commensal bacteria as well as
      propionic bacteria. Hence, DHNA might be a key bacterial metabolite in the
      host-microbe interaction to maintain intestinal microbial ecosystem.

TI  - Probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 and commensal E. coli K12 differentially
      affect the inflammasome in intestinal epithelial cells.
PG  - 110-8
LID - 10.1159/000357521 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The probiotic bacterial strain Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) is 
      used for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC), diarrhea and constipation. Its
      beneficial effects in the treatment of UC have been demonstrated in several
      controlled clinical studies; however, the mechanism of action on the cellular
      level is still not completely clear. The intracellular pattern recognition
      receptor NLRP3 is expressed in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC), activates
      caspase-1 within the inflammasome complex and has been implicated to play a role 
      in the etiology of inflammatory bowel diseases. METHODS: Probiotic EcN and
      commensal E. coli K12 were applied to IEC in vitro. Inflammasome activation,
      interleukin (IL)-18 release and caspase-1 activation were determined by
      coimmunoprecipitation, Western blot and ELISA. Apoptosis was investigated by
      Western blot. RESULTS: Incubation of Caco-2 cells with EcN resulted in lower
      inflammasome activation and subsequent secretion of mature IL-18 as compared to
      the commensal strain K12. Induction of apoptosis as determined by cleavage of
      caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase were lower in EcN-stimulated cells.
      Autophagy was induced by both bacterial strains, but to a higher extent by K12.
      CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that genetically very similar E. coli strains
      differ markedly in their ability to activate the inflammasome.

AB  - Antibiotic-associated infection with the bacterial pathogen Clostridium difficile
      is a major cause of morbidity and increased health care costs. C difficile
      infection follows disruption of the indigenous gut microbiota by antibiotics.
      Antibiotics create an environment within the intestine that promotes C difficile 
      spore germination, vegetative growth, and toxin production, leading to epithelial
      damage and colitis. Studies of patients with C difficile infection and animal
      models have shown that the indigenous microbiota can inhibit expansion and
      persistence of C difficile. Although the specific mechanisms of these processes
      are not known, they are likely to interfere with key aspects of the pathogen's
      physiology, including spore germination and competitive growth. Increasing our
      understanding of how the intestinal microbiota manage C difficile could lead to
      better means of controlling this important nosocomial pathogen.

TI  - Probiotic treatments for induction and maintenance of remission in inflammatory
      bowel diseases: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
PG  - 1-13
LID - 10.1007/s12328-013-0440-8 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics have been used for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).
      However, the effects of probiotics on the induction and maintenance of remission 
      in ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) still remain controversial.
      This systematic review verified the findings of high-quality randomized
      controlled trials (RCTs) which investigated the therapeutic effects of probiotics
      on IBD. After the quality assessment, 20 RCTs which investigated the effects of
      probiotics on the induction or maintenance of remission in IBD were identified.
      From the results of the validation of these RCTs, beneficial effects of probiotic
      treatments to improve the response rate and remission rate on the remission
      induction therapies [risk ratio (RR) 1.81; 95 % confidence interval (CI)
      1.40-2.35 and RR 1.56; 95 % CI 0.95-2.56, respectively] were verified.
      Furthermore, probiotic treatments exhibited effects equal to mesalazine on the
      maintenance of remission in UC (RR 1.00; 95 % CI 0.79-1.26). In contrast, no
      significant effect of probiotic treatments was shown in either the induction or
      maintenance of remission in CD. Because there were many variations in the
      conditions among these studies, a further analysis evaluating the effects of
      probiotic treatments in IBD is needed to clarify the optimal probiotics and
      treatment regimens for each condition or population in IBD patients.

      butyrate-producing bacteria in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 398-406
LID - 10.1128/JCM.01500-13 [doi]
AB  - Dysbiosis in the intestinal microbiota of persons with inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) has been described, but there are still varied reports on changes in the
      abundance of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus organisms in patients with IBD.
      The aim of this investigation was to compare the compositions of
      mucosa-associated and fecal bacteria in patients with IBD and in healthy controls
      (HCs). Fecal and biopsy samples from 21 HCs, 21 and 15 Crohn's disease (CD)
      patients, and 34 and 29 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, respectively, were
      analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene. The bacterial
      numbers were transformed into relative percentages for statistical analysis. The 
      proportions of bacteria were uniformly distributed along the colon regardless of 
      the disease state. Bifidobacterium was significantly increased in the biopsy
      specimens of active UC patients compared to those in the HCs (4.6% versus 2.1%, P
      = 0.001), and the proportion of Bifidobacterium was significantly higher in the
      biopsy specimens than in the fecal samples in active CD patients (2.7% versus
      2.0%, P = 0.012). The Lactobacillus group was significantly increased in the
      biopsy specimens of active CD patients compared to those in the HCs (3.4% versus 
      2.3%, P = 0.036). Compared to the HCs, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii was sharply
      decreased in both the fecal and biopsy specimens of the active CD patients (0.3% 
      versus 14.0%, P < 0.0001 for fecal samples; 0.8% versus 11.4%, P < 0.0001 for
      biopsy specimens) and the active UC patients (4.3% versus 14.0%, P = 0.001 for
      fecal samples; 2.8% versus 11.4%, P < 0.0001 for biopsy specimens). In
      conclusion, Bifidobacterium and the Lactobacillus group were increased in active 
      IBD patients and should be used more cautiously as probiotics during the active
      phase of IBD. Butyrate-producing bacteria might be important to gut homeostasis.

AB  - Gut microbiota is more and more important since metagenomic research have brought
      new knowledge on this topic especially for human health. Firstly, gut microbiota 
      is a key element for our organism he lives in symbiosis with. Secondly, it
      interacts favorably with many physiological functions of our organism. Thirdly,
      at the opposite, it can be an active participant in intestinal pathologies linked
      to a dysbiosis mainly in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn disease
      or ulcerative colitis but also in obesity, metabolic syndrome, and more prudently
      in autism and behavioral disorders. In order to keep a good health, it is
      essential to protect our gut microbiota as soon as our young age and maintain it 
      healthy. Face to a more and more important number of publications for treating
      certain digestive diseases with fecal microbial transplantation, it needs to be
      very careful and recommend further studies in order to assess risks and define
      standardized protocols. Gut microbiota metabolic capacities towards xenobiotics
      need to be developed, and we must take an interest in the modifications they
      induce on medicinal molecules. On the other hand, it is essential to study the
      potent effects of pesticides and other pollutants on microbiota functions.

TI  - Clostridium difficile infection: molecular pathogenesis and novel therapeutics.
PG  - 131-50
LID - 10.1586/14787210.2014.866515 [doi]
AB  - The Gram-positive anaerobic bacterium Clostridium difficile produces toxins A and
      B, which can cause a spectrum of diseases from pseudomembranous colitis to C.
      difficile-associated diarrhea. A limited number of C. difficile strains also
      produce a binary toxin that exhibits ADP ribosyltransferase activity. Here, the
      structure and the mechanism of action of these toxins as well as their role in
      disease are reviewed. Nosocomial C. difficile infection is often contracted in
      hospital when patients treated with antibiotics suffer a disturbance in normal
      gut microflora. C. difficile spores can persist on dry, inanimate surface for
      months. Metronidazole and oral vancomycin are clinically used for treatment of C.
      difficile infection but clinical failure and concern about promotion of
      resistance are motivating the search for novel non-antibiotic therapeutics.
      Methods for controlling both toxins and spores, replacing gut microflora by
      probiotics or fecal transplant, and killing bacteria in the anaerobic gut by
      photodynamic therapy are discussed.

TI  - Myroides pelagicus from the gut of Drosophila melanogaster attenuates
      inflammation on dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis.
PG  - 1121-33
LID - 10.1007/s10620-013-3010-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Probiotics are live microorganisms that confer a health
      benefit on the host when administered in adequate amounts. In the present study, 
      the putative probiotic strain was identified from the gut of Drosophila
      melanogaster and assessed for its protective effect in inflammatory bowel
      disease. METHODS: Active probiotics were screened from the Drosophila
      melanogaster gut by the selection criteria of gastric juice tolerance,
      hydrophobic property, antimicrobial potential, adhesion, and invasion properties.
      The active probiotics were identified by 16s rDNA sequencing and the effect of
      these active probiotics was evaluated in a Dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced 
      mice model by estimating inflammatory markers and histopathological changes.
      RESULTS: Nine Gram-positive and bile salt tolerant bacterial isolates were
      obtained from the gut samples. The isolates PTH 2, PTH 4, and PTH 7 clearly
      showed significant activity in antimicrobial potential, hydrophobic (>74%)
      property, and intestinal juice tolerance. Among these, PTH 7 was selected for
      further studies due to its significant low-invasion ability and it proved capable
      of reducing the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. The 16s rDNA studies
      revealed that PTH 7 was Myroides pelagicus. Administration of M. pelagicus to the
      DSS-induced colitic animals significantly suppressed myeloperoxidase, ALP, and
      malondialdehyde levels, and also lowered levels of proinflammatory cytokine
      expression. Further, the recovery from the disease by the probiotic treatment was
      supported by histopathological and macroscopic observation. The treated animals
      did not show any adverse signs in their physiology or behavior. CONCLUSION:
      Myroides pelagicus successfully prohibited inflammatory markers and acted as a
      potent probiotic. Future studies with this stain might prove its efficacy as a
      drug for the management of colitis.

TI  - Probiotics, prebiotics and symbiotics in inflammatory bowel diseases:
      state-of-the-art and new insights.
PG  - 919-33
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consists of two distinct clinical forms,
      ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), with unknown aetiology, which
      nevertheless are considered to share almost identical pathophysiological
      backgrounds. Up to date, a full coherent mechanistic explanation for IBD is still
      lacking, but people start to realize that the pathogenesis of IBD involves four
      fundamental components: the environment, gut microbiota, the immune system and
      the genome. As a consequence, IBD development might be due to an altered immune
      response and a disrupted mechanism of host tolerance to the non-pathogenic
      resident microbiota, leading to an elevated inflammatory response. Considering
      the available data arising from the scientific literature, here reviewed, in CD, 
      a benefit of probiotics remains unproven; in UC, a benefit of probiotics remains 
      unproven, even if E. coli Nissle 1917 seems promising in maintaining remission
      and it could be considered an alternative in patients intolerant or resistant to 
      5-ASA preparations; in pouchitis, small controlled trials suggest a benefit from 
      VSL no. 3 in the primary and secondary prevention of pouchitis; in IBD-associated
      conditions, a benefit of probiotics remains unproven. However, well-designed
      randomized control clinical trials are necessary to understand the undoubted role
      of these agents in the management of gut physiology in health and disease.

AB  - PURPOSE OF RESEARCH: Revision of the literature on targeted therapy-induced
      diarrhea (TT-ID). PRINCIPAL RESULTS: TT-ID is frequent; the mechanisms are mainly
      secretive, followed by ischemic or autoimmune ones. The duration of TT-ID is
      protracted over time. Its intensity is of grade G1-G3 but may be fatal in
      patients with diffuse colitis or on ipilimumab. However, no specific guidelines
      are available on management of different grades of TT-ID. Preventive measures
      with antibiotics, probiotics or activated charcoal should be further
      investigated. Loperamide is the first choice drug followed by octreotide. The
      role of corticosteroids is controversial. CONCLUSION: Early assessment and
      management of TT-ID is essential to prevent the worsening of this side-effect,
      patients' hospitalization and dose reduction or oncological treatment
      discontinuation. Future research is needed to better understand the
      pathophysiological mechanisms of TT-ID and it should also be investigated whether
      a specific pharmacological and/or non pharmachological approach is indicated.

TI  - Altered human gut dendritic cell properties in ulcerative colitis are reversed by
      Lactobacillus plantarum extracellular encrypted peptide STp.
PG  - 1132-43
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201300596 [doi]
AB  - SCOPE: The human/microbiota cross-talk is partially mediated by bacteria-derived 
      peptides like Serine-Threonine peptide (STp), which is resistant to gut
      proteolysis, is found in the human healthy colon and induces regulatory
      properties on gut dendritic cells (DCs); here we characterized human gut DC in
      ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and studied the effect of STp on their
      properties. METHODS AND RESULTS: Human colonic DC from healthy controls and UC
      patients were isolated, conditioned for 24 h +/- STp and characterized by flow
      cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy. Expression of immature 
      DC markers DC-SIGN and ILT3, and Toll-like receptors were increased on gut UC-DC.
      Langerin (involved in phagocytosis), lymph node homing marker CCR7, and
      activation markers CD40/CD80/CD86 were decreased in UC. Gut DC had restricted
      stimulatory capacity for T-cells in UC. Conditioning of DC with STp in vitro
      reduced Toll-like receptor expression, increased CD40 and CD80 expression, and
      restored their stimulatory capacity. CONCLUSION: Colonic DCs display an abnormal 
      immature phenotype in UC, which was partially restored following STp treatment.
      Bacteria-derived metabolites, like STp, seem to have a role in gut homeostasis
      that is missing in UC so they might lead a new era of probiotic products setting 
      the basis for nondrug dietary therapy in inflammatory bowel disease.

AB  - The diverse and complex community of microorganisms that has co-evolved with the 
      human gut is vital to intestinal functioning, and disturbances in the microbiota 
      and its relationship with the host immune system have been linked to inflammatory
      bowel diseases, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. This has
      suggested several treatment options, including antibiotics, probiotics and faecal
      transplantation. The human microbiome project has been established to enable
      comprehensive characterisation of the human microbiota and in the coming years,
      knowledge in this area is expected to continue to expand.

TI  - Effect of probiotics on inducing remission and maintaining therapy in ulcerative 
      colitis, Crohn's disease, and pouchitis: meta-analysis of randomized controlled
      trials.
PG  - 21-35

AB  - BACKGROUND: Whether probiotics are beneficial at all stages of treatment in
      inflammatory bowel disease or superior to placebo remains controversial. METHODS:
      Two reviewers independently selected randomized controlled trials comparing
      probiotics with controls in inflammatory bowel disease and extracted data related
      to remission/response rates, relapse rates, and adverse events. Subanalyses were 
      also performed. RESULTS: Twenty-three randomized controlled trials with a total
      of 1763 participants met the inclusion criteria. From the meta-analysis,
      probiotics significantly increase the remission rates in patients with active
      ulcerative colitis (UC) (P = 0.01, risk ratio [RR] = 1.51). The remission rates
      were significantly higher in patients with active UC treated with probiotics than
      placebo (P < 0.0001, RR = 1.80). Unfortunately, subgroup analysis found that only
      VSL#3 significantly increased the remission rates compared with controls in
      patients with active UC (P = 0.004, RR = 1.74). Interestingly, VSL#3 (P <
      0.00001, RR = 0.18) also significantly reduced the clinical relapse rates for
      maintaining remission in patients with pouchitis. No significantly different
      adverse events were detected between probiotics and controls in the treatment of 
      UC (P = 0.94, RR = 0.99) or CD (P = 0.33, RR = 0.87). CONCLUSIONS: Administration
      of probiotics results in additional benefit in inducing remission of patients
      with UC. VSL#3 are beneficial for maintaining remission in patients with
      pouchitis. And, probiotics can provide the similar effect as 5-aminosalicylic
      acid on maintaining remission of UC, although no additional adverse events
      presented.

AB  - Ample research has described multiple biological activities of probiotics in
      animals and in humans. Probiotics interfere with local and systemic immune
      reactions and thus exert an influence on the barrier function of the intestinal
      mucosa. Therefore, attempting inflammatory bowel disease treatment with
      probiotics seems reasonable. In fact, a growing number of trials have studied the
      therapeutic effects in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Promising results 
      have been found and in some, indications such as maintenance of remission of
      ulcerative colitis and pouchitis guidelines recommend therapy with probiotics
      already today. However, many open questions still remain and the urgent need for 
      high-quality trials requires much more research in the future.

TI  - The human microbiome and probiotics: implications for pediatrics.
PG  - 42-52
LID - 10.1159/000354899 [doi]
AB  - Steady advances in our knowledge of the composition and function of the human
      microbiome at multiple body sites including the gut, skin and airways will likely
      contribute to our understanding of mechanisms of probiotic action by beneficial
      microbes. Microbe:microbe and microbe:human interactions are important
      considerations as we select probiotics for pediatric patients in the future.
      Although our knowledge about the composition of the microbiome is progressing
      rapidly, many gaps exist about the functional capacity and metabolic machinery of
      the human microbiome. Based on a limited amount of data, probiotics appear
      capable of altering the composition and function of the microbiome. Probiotics
      may be part of dietary strategies that combine ways to enhance microbiome
      function with nutrients that may be converted to active compounds promoting human
      health. Probiotics have yielded beneficial effects in numerous studies in the
      context of different diseases in pediatric gastroenterology. These disease states
      include necrotizing enterocolitis, antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis,
      acute gastroenteritis and irritable bowel syndrome. In the skin and airways, it
      is unclear if probiotics can affect the function of the microbiome to reduce the 
      impact of diseases such as asthma and atopic dermatitis. An enhanced
      understanding of the effects of probiotics on the microbiome should facilitate
      selection of optimal probiotic strains for specific diseases in the future.

AB  - Probiotic microorganisms have historically been used to rebalance disturbed
      intestinal microbiota and to diminish gastrointestinal disorders, such as
      diarrhea or inflammatory bowel diseases (e.g., Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis). Recent studies explore the potential for expanded uses of probiotics on
      medical disorders that increase the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases
      and diabetes, such as obesity, hypercholesterolemia, arterial hypertension, and
      metabolic disturbances such as hyperhomocysteinemia and oxidative stress. This
      review aims at summarizing the proposed molecular and cellular mechanisms
      involved in probiotic-host interactions and to identify the nature of the
      resulting beneficial effects. Specific probiotic strains can act by modulating
      immune response, by producing particular molecules or releasing biopeptides, and 
      by modulating nervous system activity. To date, the majority of studies have been
      conducted in animal models. New investigations on the related mechanisms in
      humans need to be carried out to better enable targeted and effective use of the 
      broad variety of probiotic strains.

AB  - We report the case of a 69-year-old man who presented with acute kidney injury in
      the setting of community-acquired Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea and
      biopsy-proven acute oxalate nephropathy. We discuss potential mechanisms,
      including increased colonic permeability to oxalate. We conclude that C
      difficile-associated diarrhea is a potential cause of acute oxalate nephropathy.

TI  - Role of probiotics in the management of pouchitis.
PG  - 4561-4
AB  - The concept that the gut microbiota plays a major role in the development of
      pouchitis in ulcerative colitis patients after restorative proctocolectomy with
      ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, is widely accepted and supported by a widespread
      use of some antibiotics (metronidazole and/or ciprofloxacin, rifaximin) to treat 
      this condition. A possible, safer therapeutic alternative is represented by
      probiotics. To date the controlled studies addressing the possible efficacy of
      probiotic agents in the treatment of active pouchitis are few and inconclusive.
      By contrast the prophylactic use of a probiotic mixture (VSL #3) appears to be
      able to prevent development of pouchitis. The most convincing results have been
      observed in the maintenance of remission, where the probiotic mixture has been
      found, in most of the performed controlled trials, significantly effective in
      preventing pouchitis recurrence.

TI  - Probiotics in the management of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 4556-60
AB  - Probiotics are nowadays frequently used by patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease, however literature data are conflicting related to their importance. In 
      mild to moderate ulcerative colitis probiotics can be used effectively in
      induction and maintaining remission, and prevention of pouchitis. As the other
      side of the shield, there is not sufficient evidence to support the use of
      probiotics in daily clinical practice in Crohn's disease. The aim of the present 
      review is to provide help for clinicians about the probiotic use in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease. The comparison of literature data is limited by the
      large number of probiotic strains, various combined preparations, and different
      doses applied in the clinical studies. Small number of comparable protocols and
      lack of standardization encumber the analysis of study results.

TI  - Common gastrointestinal symptoms: irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 16-23
AB  - The diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) should be considered when
      patients have had abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating, and change in bowel habits
      for 6 months. Patients may experience variation between periods of constipation
      and diarrhea. When evaluating patients with IBS, physicians should be alert for
      red flag symptoms, such as rectal bleeding, anemia, nighttime pain, and weight
      loss. Physicians also should consider other medical conditions that manifest
      similarly to IBS. Clinicians who are confident in diagnosing IBS based on
      symptoms typically do not obtain many tests unless the patient has red flag
      symptoms. Various etiologic mechanisms have been proposed for IBS, including
      abnormal bowel motility, inflammation, altered mucosal permeability, genetic
      predisposition, and visceral hypersensitivity. Lack of certainty about the
      etiology makes it difficult to develop effective management approaches; thus,
      management is directed toward symptom relief. Dietary changes, such as avoiding
      fermentable carbohydrates, may benefit some patients, especially those with
      bloating. Constipation-dominant IBS can be managed with antispasmodics,
      lubiprostone, or linaclotide, whereas diarrhea-dominant IBS can be managed with
      loperamide or alosetron, though the latter drug can cause ischemic colitis. For
      long-term therapy, tricyclic antidepressants or selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors have good efficacy. Peppermint oil and probiotics also may provide
      benefit.

TI  - Lactobacillus reuteri-specific immunoregulatory gene rsiR modulates histamine
      production and immunomodulation by Lactobacillus reuteri.
PG  - 5567-76
LID - 10.1128/JB.00261-13 [doi]
AB  - Human microbiome-derived strains of Lactobacillus reuteri potently suppress
      proinflammatory cytokines like human tumor necrosis factor (TNF) by converting
      the amino acid l-histidine to the biogenic amine histamine. Histamine suppresses 
      mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation and cytokine production by
      signaling via histamine receptor type 2 (H2) on myeloid cells. Investigations of 
      the gene expression profiles of immunomodulatory L. reuteri ATCC PTA 6475
      highlighted numerous genes that were highly expressed during the stationary phase
      of growth, when TNF suppression is most potent. One such gene was found to be a
      regulator of genes involved in histidine-histamine metabolism by this probiotic
      species. During the course of these studies, this gene was renamed the
      Lactobacillus reuteri-specific immunoregulatory (rsiR) gene. The rsiR gene is
      essential for human TNF suppression by L. reuteri and expression of the histidine
      decarboxylase (hdc) gene cluster on the L. reuteri chromosome. Inactivation of
      rsiR resulted in diminished TNF suppression in vitro and reduced
      anti-inflammatory effects in vivo in a trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid
      (TNBS)-induced mouse model of acute colitis. A L. reuteri strain lacking an
      intact rsiR gene was unable to suppress colitis and resulted in greater
      concentrations of serum amyloid A (SAA) in the bloodstream of affected animals.
      The PhdcAB promoter region targeted by rsiR was defined by reporter gene
      experiments. These studies support the presence of a regulatory gene, rsiR, which
      modulates the expression of a gene cluster known to mediate immunoregulation by
      probiotics at the transcriptional level. These findings may point the way toward 
      new strategies for controlling gene expression in probiotics by dietary
      interventions or microbiome manipulation.

LID - 10.1016/j.ijsu.2013.08.019 [doi]
LID - S1743-9191(13)01045-5 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the spectrum of
      colonic microflora in patients with colitis and if this could be altered with one
      month's treatment with synbiotics. METHODS: This was a pilot study in which
      patients were randomised to either receive a synbiotics preparation for a month
      and then "crossed over" to receive a placebo, or alternatively to receive the
      placebo first followed in the second month by synbiotic. Stool samples were
      collected on entry into the study and then at the end of first and second months 
      respectively. Colonic microflora was measured by terminal restriction fragment
      length polymorphism technique. Quantitative PCR was used to determine the
      concentration of individual species. RESULTS: Sixteen patients completed the
      study of whom 8 had Crohn's colitis and 8 had ulcerative colitis. Their median
      age was 62 (IQR 50-65) years. An average of 22 terminal restriction fragments
      (T-RF's) was identified in each patient. Dice cluster analysis showed that each
      patient had a unique microbial composition which did not change significantly at 
      different time points in the study, irrespective of whether they had probiotics
      or the placebo. Probiotic organisms were identified in stool samples but did not 
      alter overall spectrum of microflora. In this pilot study we were unable to
      identify any specific characteristics related to nature of colitis. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This study suggests that there is no difference in colonic microflora between
      patients with Crohn's or Ulcerative colitis and that the spectrum of bacteria was
      not altered by synbiotic administration.

TI  - A Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG-derived soluble protein, p40, stimulates ligand
      release from intestinal epithelial cells to transactivate epidermal growth factor
      receptor.
PG  - 30742-51
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M113.492397 [doi]
AB  - p40, a Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG)-derived soluble protein, ameliorates
      intestinal injury and colitis, reduces apoptosis, and preserves barrier function 
      by transactivation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) in intestinal epithelial cells. The
      aim of this study is to determine the mechanisms by which p40 transactivates the 
      EGFR in intestinal epithelial cells. Here we show that p40-conditioned medium
      activates EGFR in young adult mouse colon epithelial cells and human colonic
      epithelial cell line, T84 cells. p40 up-regulates a disintegrin and
      metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 17 (ADAM17) catalytic activity, and
      broad spectrum metalloproteinase inhibitors block EGFR transactivation by p40 in 
      these two cell lines. In ADAM17-deficient mouse colonic epithelial (ADAM17(-/-)
      MCE) cells, p40 transactivation of EGFR is blocked, but can be rescued by
      re-expression with WT ADAM17. Furthermore, p40 stimulates release of heparin
      binding (HB)-EGF, but not transforming growth factor (TGF)alpha or amphiregulin, 
      in young adult mouse colon cells and ADAM17(-/-) MCE cells overexpressing WT
      ADAM17. Knockdown of HB-EGF expression by siRNA suppresses p40 effects on
      transactivating EGFR and Akt, preventing apoptosis, and preserving tight junction
      function. The effects of p40 on HB-EGF release and ADAM17 activation in vivo are 
      examined after administration of p40-containing pectin/zein hydrogel beads to
      mice. p40 stimulates ADAM17 activity and EGFR activation in colonic epithelial
      cells and increases HB-EGF levels in blood from WT mice, but not from mice with
      intestinal epithelial cell-specific ADAM17 deletion. Thus, these data define a
      mechanism of a probiotic-derived soluble protein in modulating intestinal
      epithelial cell homeostasis through ADAM17-mediated HB-EGF release, leading to
      transactivation of EGFR.

TI  - [Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 as safe vehicles for intestinal immune targeted
      therapy--a review].
PG  - 538-44
AB  - It is difficult to stimulate efficient gut mucosal immune response to intestinal 
      infection. This article critically reviews the research progressin Escherichia
      coli strain Nisslel917 ( EcN) actingas a safe vehicle for the intestinal mucosal 
      immunity, to restore gastrointestinal disorder and relieve ulcerative colitis.
      EcN is an orally administered probiotics, combining the excellent colonization
      and non-immunogenic character, and can be an ideal live vector candidate. This
      strain could be a tumor-targeted delivery of TAT-Apoptin fusion gene to
      colorectal cancer. In the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease,
      the recombinant strain of EcN can be used as a target therapeutics for defensins 
      presenting. Genetically modified EcN could be an ideal carrier organism for
      gut-focused in situ synthesis and expression of specific localized antigen
      delivery into the intestine, and stimulate specific mucosal immune response. In
      vitro trial demonstrated that intestinal recombinant E. coli Nissle-HA110-120 has
      the potential to stimulate antigen specific response, but EcN itself does not
      induce mucosal immune response and influence peripheral tolerance to
      self-antigen. At the same time, there are evidences that EcN is safe. Recombinant
      E. coli Nissle-HA110-120 does not migrate, clonally expand and activate specific 
      CD4+ T cells, neither in healthy mice nor in other animals with acute colitis,
      even when the intestinal epithelium suffer from inflammation and the barrier
      function of the epithelial layer being destroyed.

TI  - Effects of probiotics and prebiotics in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 540-3
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are caused by the failure of
      immunoregulatory mechanisms due to external environmental factors in genetically 
      predisposed individuals. Probiotics and prebiotics could be used in prevention
      and therapy of many disorders of gastrointestinal tract including ulcerative
      colitis. Probiotics are living microorganisms with good tolerability and minimal 
      risk, which confer a health benefit for the host when administered in adequate
      amounts. Their effect is closely related to maintaining the natural function of
      the intestinal flora. In this respect, they are indispensable prebiotics to
      protect or reduce the incidence of inflammatory lesions in diseases of the
      digestive tract. CONCLUSION: Ingestion of probiotics and prebiotics may provide
      some clues in developing a new class of therapeutic agents for the treatment/
      prevention of IBD and colitis-associated cancer (CAC) in the future (Tab. 2, Ref.
      26).

AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases are chronic diseases affecting the gastrointestinal
      tract, whose major forms are represented by Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative
      colitis (UC). Their etiology is still unclear, although several factors have been
      identified as major determinants for induction or relapses. Among these, the role
      of the "forgotten organ", gut microbiota, has become more appreciated in recent
      years. The delicate symbiotic relationship between the gut microbiota and the
      host appears to be lost in IBD. In this perspective, several studies have been
      conducted to assess the role of prebiotics and probiotics in gut microbiota
      modulation. This is a minireview aimed to address in an easy format (simple
      questions-simple answers) some common issues about the theme. An update on the
      role of selected constituents of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBD is
      presented together with the analysis of the efficacy of gut microbiota modulation
      by prebiotics and probiotics administration in the management of IBD.

TI  - Dysregulated circulating dendritic cell function in ulcerative colitis is
      partially restored by probiotic strain Lactobacillus casei Shirota.
PG  - 573576
LID - 10.1155/2013/573576 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dendritic cells regulate immune responses to microbial products and
      play a key role in ulcerative colitis (UC) pathology. We determined the
      immunomodulatory effects of probiotic strain Lactobacillus casei Shirota (LcS) on
      human DC from healthy controls and active UC patients. METHODS: Human blood DC
      from healthy controls (control-DC) and UC patients (UC-DC) were conditioned with 
      heat-killed LcS and used to stimulate allogeneic T cells in a 5-day mixed
      leucocyte reaction. RESULTS: UC-DC displayed a reduced stimulatory capacity for T
      cells (P < 0.05) and enhanced expression of skin-homing markers CLA and CCR4 on
      stimulated T cells (P < 0.05) that were negative for gut-homing marker beta7. LcS
      treatment restored the stimulatory capacity of UC-DC, reflecting that of
      control-DC. LcS treatment conditioned control-DC to induce CLA on T cells in
      conjunction with beta7, generating a multihoming profile, but had no effects on
      UC-DC. Finally, LcS treatment enhanced DC ability to induce TGFbeta production by
      T cells in controls but not UC patients. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a systemic, 
      dysregulated DC function in UC that may account for the propensity of UC patients
      to develop cutaneous manifestations. LcS has multifunctional immunoregulatory
      activities depending on the inflammatory state; therapeutic effects reported in
      UC may be due to promotion of homeostasis.

TI  - The effects of probiotics on barrier function and mucosal pouch microbiota during
      maintenance treatment for severe pouchitis in patients with ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 772-83
LID - 10.1111/apt.12451 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A total of 10-15% of patients with an ileoanal pouch develop severe
      pouchitis necessitating long-term use of antibiotics or pouch excision.
      Probiotics reduce the risk of recurrence of pouchitis, but mechanisms behind
      these effects are not fully understood. AIM: To examine mucosal barrier function 
      in pouchitis, before and after probiotic supplementation and to assess
      composition of mucosal pouch microbiota. METHODS: Sixteen patients with severe
      pouchitis underwent endoscopy with biopsies of the pouch on three occasions:
      during active pouchitis; clinical remission by 4 weeks of antibiotics; after 8
      weeks of subsequent probiotic supplementation (Ecologic 825, Winclove, Amsterdam,
      the Netherlands). Thirteen individuals with a healthy ileoanal pouch were sampled
      once as controls. Ussing chambers were used to assess transmucosal passage of
      Escherichia coli K12, permeability to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and
      (5)(1)Cr-EDTA. Composition and diversity of the microbiota was analysed using
      Human Intestinal Tract Chip. RESULTS: Pouchitis Disease Activity Index (PDAI) was
      significantly improved after antibiotic and probiotic supplementation.
      Escherichia coli K12 passage during active pouchitis [3.7 (3.4-8.5); median
      (IQR)] was significantly higher than in controls [1.7 (1.0-2.4); P < 0.01], did
      not change after antibiotic treatment [5.0 (3.3-7.1); P = ns], but was
      significantly reduced after subsequent probiotic supplementation [2.2 (1.7-3.3); 
      P < 0.05]. No significant effects of antibiotics or probiotics were observed on
      composition of mucosal pouch microbiota; however, E. coli passage correlated with
      bacterial diversity (r = -0.40; P = 0.018). Microbial groups belonging to
      Bacteroidetes and Clostridium clusters IX, XI and XIVa were associated with
      healthy pouches. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics restored the mucosal barrier to E. coli 
      and HRP in patients with pouchitis, a feasible factor in prevention of recurrence
      during maintenance treatment. Restored barrier function did not translate into
      significant changes in mucosal microbiota composition, but bacterial diversity
      correlated with barrier function.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the major types of chronic
      inflammatory bowel disease occurring in the colon and small intestine. A growing 
      body of research has proposed that probiotics are able to attenuate the
      inflammatory symptoms of these diseases in vitro and in vivo. However, the
      mechanism of probiotic actions remains unclear. RESULTS: Our results suggested
      Lactobacillus plantarum MYL26 inhibited inflammation in Caco-2 cells through
      regulation of gene expressions of TOLLIP, SOCS1, SOCS3, and IkappaBalpha, rather 
      than SHIP-1 and IRAK-3. CONCLUSIONS: We proposed that live/ heat-killed
      Lactobacillus plantarum MYL26 and bacterial cell wall extract treatments impaired
      TLR4-NFkappab signal transduction through Tollip, SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 activation,
      thus inducing LPS tolerance. Our findings suggest that either heat-killed
      probiotics or probiotic cell wall extracts are able to attenuate inflammation
      through pathways similar to that of live bacteria.

AB  - Ulcerative colitis diagnosis and management represent a challenge for clinicians.
      The disguises of ischemia and acute infectious colitis continue to confound the
      diagnosis. The therapeutic options have remarkably expanded in the way of
      immunomodulators, biologics, or ileoanal pouch surgery, yet all carry potential
      considerable risks. These risks can confuse and impair patient acceptance,
      particularly elderly patients and men younger than 30 years. Predictors of
      outcome of medical and surgical therapy have improved but are far from complete. 
      Nevertheless, therapies focused on the specific patient's condition continue to
      offer hope.

AB  - Host inflammation alters the availability of nutrients such as iron to limit
      microbial growth. However, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium thrives in the
      inflamed gut by scavenging for iron with siderophores. By administering
      Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917, which assimilates iron by similar
      mechanisms, we show that this nonpathogenic bacterium can outcompete and reduce
      S. Typhimurium colonization in mouse models of acute colitis and chronic
      persistent infection. This probiotic activity depends on E. coli Nissle iron
      acquisition, given that mutants deficient in iron uptake colonize the intestine
      but do not reduce S. Typhimurium colonization. Additionally, the ability of E.
      coli Nissle to overcome iron restriction by the host protein lipocalin 2, which
      counteracts some siderophores, is essential, given that S. Typhimurium is
      unaffected by E. coli Nissle in lipocalin 2-deficient mice. Thus, iron
      availability impacts S. Typhimurium growth, and E. coli Nissle reduces S.
      Typhimurium intestinal colonization by competing for this limiting nutrient.

TI  - Gut microbiota imbalance and chaperoning system malfunction are central to
      ulcerative colitis pathogenesis and can be counteracted with specifically
      designed probiotics: a working hypothesis.
PG  - 393-406
LID - 10.1007/s00430-013-0305-2 [doi]
AB  - In this work, we propose that for further studies of the physiopathology and
      treatment for inflammatory bowel diseases, an integral view of the conditions,
      including the triad of microbiota-heat shock proteins (HSPs)-probiotics, ought to
      be considered. Microbiota is the complex microbial flora that resides in the gut,
      affecting not only gut functions but also the health status of the whole body.
      Alteration in the microbiota's composition has been implicated in a variety of
      pathological conditions (e.g., ulcerative colitis, UC), involving both gut and
      extra-intestinal tissues and organs. Some of these pathologies are also
      associated with an altered expression of HSPs (chaperones) and this is the reason
      why they may be considered chaperonopathies. Probiotics, which are live
      microorganisms able to restore the correct, healthy equilibrium of microbiota
      composition, can ameliorate symptoms in patients suffering from UC and modulate
      expression levels of HSPs. However, currently probiotic therapy follows
      ex-adiuvantibus criteria, i.e., treatments with beneficial effects but whose
      mechanism of action is unknown, which should be changed so the probiotics needed 
      in each case are predetermined on the basis of the patient's microbiota.
      Consequently, efforts are necessary to develop diagnostic tools for elucidating
      levels and distribution of HSPs and the microbiota composition (microbiota
      fingerprint) of each subject and, thus, guide specific probiotic therapy,
      tailored to meet the needs of the patient. Microbiota fingerprinting ought to
      include molecular biology techniques for sequencing highly conserved DNA, e.g.,
      genes encoding 16S RNA, for species identification and, in addition,
      quantification of each relevant microbe.

AB  - Food-grade lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are good candidates for the development of 
      oral vectors, and are attractive alternatives to attenuated pathogens, for
      mucosal delivery strategies. In this review, we summarize recent results on the
      use of LAB as mucosal delivery vectors for therapeutic proteins and DNA vaccines.
      Most of this work has been based on the model LAB, Lactococcus lactis, which is
      suitable for the heterologous expression of therapeutic proteins. Recombinant
      lactococci and lactobacilli strains expressing antiproteases and antioxidant
      enzymes have been tested successfully for their prophylactic and therapeutic
      effects in murine models of colitis. Recombinant lactococci secreting
      autoantigens have been found to be effective for the treatment of type 1
      diabetes. Also, recombinant lactococci delivering DNA were able to prevent a
      bovine beta-lactoglobulin (BLG)-allergic reaction in mice. We believe that these 
      various coherent findings demonstrate the potential value of using LAB,
      particularly lactococci and lactobacilli strains, to develop novel vectors for
      the therapeutic delivery of proteins to mucosal surfaces. Further tests and in
      particular human clinical trials are now important next steps to conclude on the 
      benefit of these approaches for human health.

TI  - Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 modulates host inflammatory processes beyond the
      gut.
PG  - 325-39
LID - 10.4161/gmic.25487 [doi]
AB  - Certain therapeutic microbes, including Bifidobacteria infantis (B. infantis)
      35624 exert beneficial immunoregulatory effects by mimicking commensal-immune
      interactions; however, the value of these effects in patients with
      non-gastrointestinal inflammatory conditions remains unclear. In this study, we
      assessed the impact of oral administration of B. infantis 35624, for 68 weeks on 
      inflammatory biomarker and plasma cytokine levels in patients with ulcerative
      colitis (UC) (n = 22), chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) (n = 48) and psoriasis (n =
      26) in three separate randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled interventions.
      Additionally, the effect of B. infantis 35624 on immunological biomarkers in
      healthy subjects (n = 22) was assessed. At baseline, both gastrointestinal (UC)
      and non-gastrointestinal (CFS and psoriasis) patients had significantly increased
      plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and the pro-inflammatory cytokines
      tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) compared with
      healthy volunteers. B. infantis 35624 feeding resulted in reduced plasma CRP
      levels in all three inflammatory disorders compared with placebo. Interestingly, 
      plasma TNF-alpha was reduced in CFS and psoriasis while IL-6 was reduced in UC
      and CFS. Furthermore, in healthy subjects, LPS-stimulated TNF-alpha and IL-6
      secretion by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was significantly reduced
      in the B. infantis 35624-treated groups compared with placebo following eight
      weeks of feeding. These results demonstrate the ability of this microbe to reduce
      systemic pro-inflammatory biomarkers in both gastrointestinal and
      non-gastrointestinal conditions. In conclusion, these data show that the
      immunomodulatory effects of the microbiota in humans are not limited to the
      mucosal immune system but extend to the systemic immune system.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The lumen of the gastrointestinal tract contains many substances
      produced from the breakdown of foodstuffs, from salivary, esophageal, intestinal,
      hepatic, and pancreatic secretions, and from sloughed cells present in the
      gastrointestinal lumen. Although these substances were traditionally regarded as 
      waste products, there is increasing realization that many can be biologically
      active, either as signalling compounds or as nutrients. For example, proteins are
      broken down into amino acids, which are then sensed by nutrient receptors. The
      gut microbiome, which is at highest abundance in the ileocecum, has powerful
      metabolic activity, digesting and breaking down unabsorbed carbohydrates,
      proteins, and other ingested nutrients into phenols, amines, volatile organic
      compounds, methane, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and hydrogen sulfide into volatile 
      fatty acids, also called short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). CONCLUSION: These
      latter substances are the topic of this review. In this review, we will briefly
      discuss recent advances in the understanding SCFA production, signalling, and
      absorption, followed by a detailed description and discussion of trials of SCFAs,
      probiotics, and prebiotics in the treatment of gastrointestinal disease, in
      particular ulcerative colitis (UC), pouchitis, short bowel syndrome, and obesity.

AB  - Faecalibacterium prausnitzii is the most abundant bacterium in the human
      intestinal microbiota of healthy adults, representing more than 5% of the total
      bacterial population. Over the past five years, an increasing number of studies
      have clearly described the importance of this highly metabolically active
      commensal bacterium as a component of the healthy human microbiota. Changes in
      the abundance of F. prausnitzii have been linked to dysbiosis in several human
      disorders. Administration of F. prausnitzii strain A2-165 and its culture
      supernatant have been shown to protect against 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid
      (TNBS)-induced colitis in mice. Here, we discuss the role of F. prausnitzii in
      balancing immunity in the intestine and the mechanisms involved.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease: etiology, pathogenesis and current therapy.
PG  - 1082-96
AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) constitute the two major groups 
      of idiopathic disorders in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Environmental
      factors, genetic factors and immune responses have been considered as the major
      etiology of IBD. Despite the diversified pathogenesis of the disease, no
      guaranteed curative therapeutic regimen has been developed so far. This review
      summarizes the knowledge on the pathophysiology and current treatment approaches 
      of IBD. Since IBD is caused by excessive and tissue- disruptive inflammatory
      reactions of the gut wall, down-regulation of the immune responses may allow the 
      damaged mucosa to heal and reset the physiological functions of the gut back to
      normal. Current pharmacotherapy through modulation of neutrophil-derived factors,
      cytokines, adhesion molecules and reactive oxygen/nitrogen metabolites has been
      utterly described. Categories of treatment modalities include corticosteroids,
      aminosalicylates, immunomodulators, antibiotics, probiotics, and a series of
      unique novel agents. The use of anti-tumor necrosis factor monoclonal antibody
      (Infliximab), recombinant anti-inflammatory cytokines and related gene therapy
      has been covered. In addition, discussions on dietary supplementation and heparin
      treatment are also included. The anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory potential
      of investigational agents such as nicotine and the filtered protective compounds 
      from tobacco smoke, as well as active herbal medicinal compounds were tested in
      our previous experimental works, whereas promising findings have been presented
      here. With the discovery of novel target-oriented agents, more effective and
      relatively harmless approaches of IBD therapy could be established to achieve a
      curative outcome. Indeed, more experimental and clinical studies are needed to
      confirm the relevance of these therapies.

PG  - 1063-81
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and relapsing inflammatory
      condition of the gastrointestinal tract. The two main forms of IBD are Crohn's
      disease and ulcerative colitis. According to the recent concept the disease is
      caused by a combination of factors, including genetics, immune dysregulation,
      barrier dysfunction and the change in microbial flora. Environmental factors,
      such as changes in diet, antibiotic use, smoking or improved domestic hygiene
      (e.g. eradication of intestinal helminths) probably contribute to the development
      and increased prevalence of IBD. Dysregulation of mucosal immunity in IBD causes 
      an overproduction of inflammatory cytokines which resulted in uncontrolled
      intestinal inflammation. Based on extensive research over the last decade,
      besides the conventional therapy, there are several novel pathways and specific
      targets, on which focus new therapeutics. New therapeutics aim 1./ to correct
      genetic susceptibility by stimulating NOD2 expression, TLR3 signaling or
      inhibition of TLR4 pathway, 2./ to restore the immune dysregulation by inhibition
      of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-13, IL-17, IL-18, IL-21), Th1 
      polarisation (IL-2, IL-12, IL-23, IFN-gamma ), T-cell activation, leukocyte
      adhesion, as well as by immunostimulation (GM-CSF, G-CSF) and anti-inflammatory
      cytokines (IL-10, IL-11, IFN-beta-1a), 3./ to restore mucosal barrier function
      and stimulate mucosal healing by different growth factors, such as GH, EGF, KGF, 
      TGF-beta, VEGF, 4./ to restore the normal bacterial flora by antibiotics,
      probiotics. However, in spite of these numerous potential targets, the true value
      and clinical significance of most of the new biologics and molecules are not
      clear yet.

      gastrointestinal disorders.
PG  - 1149-55
AB  - A growing body of experimental and clinical evidence supports the hypothesis that
      the intestinal microbiota markedly influences function and the structure of the
      mucosal lining. Intestinal microbiota can potentially cause damage to the mucosa 
      either directly by releasing toxins or indirectly by causing a detrimental immune
      response. Probiotic bacteria have been defined as live microorganisms, which when
      consumed in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit for the host. In recent
      years, the therapeutic and preventive application of probiotics for several
      gastrointestinal and liver disorders has received increasing attention.
      Probiotics appear to be beneficial for premature infants who suffer necrotizing
      enterocolitis. The effectiveness of certain probiotics as treatment for
      infectious and antibioticassociated diarrhea in adults and for allergic disorders
      in children has been supported by clinical studies; however, the potential
      mechanism( s) remains to be studied. Experimental studies and clinical trials for
      probiotic treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have yielded conflicting
      results. Daily intake of selected probiotics was effective in the prevention of
      ulcerative colitis and the attenuation of the active onset of Crohn's disease or 
      ulcerative colitis but others failed to show a beneficial effect. The combination
      of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces boulardi and the treatment with 
      Escherichia coli Nissle were found beneficial in inducing and maintaining
      remission of disease activity of gut inflammation and moderately severe
      ulcerative colitis. Probiotic bacteria were considered in some studies as a safe 
      adjuvant when added to triple eradication therapy against the symptoms induced by
      the major gastric pathogen, Helicobacter pylori. This review attempted to
      overview these new exciting advances in the role of these microbes in the
      pathogenesis, management and treatment of gastrointestinal disorders.

AB  - Approaches for management of Clostridium difficile infection continually evolve
      as research reveals shifts in epidemiology, microbial pathogenesis, disease
      severity states, and response to therapy. These new discoveries significantly
      impact diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, given the high morbidity associated
      with this common nosocomial infectious diarrhea. Critically ill patients are at
      an increased risk of developing diarrheal illness like C. difficile and
      succumbing to potentially fatal complications of this infection. Early diagnosis 
      of severe disease state may improve patient outcomes. In this article, we review 
      treatment strategies and new approaches for the management of C. difficile in
      critically ill patients.

TI  - Probiotic yeast inhibits VEGFR signaling and angiogenesis in intestinal
      inflammation.
PG  - e64227
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0064227 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Saccharomyces boulardii (Sb) can protect against intestinal 
      injury and tumor formation, but how this probiotic yeast controls protective
      mucosal host responses is unclear. Angiogenesis is an integral process of
      inflammatory responses in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and required for
      mucosal remodeling during restitution. The aim of this study was to determine
      whether Sb alters VEGFR (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor) signaling, 
      a central regulator of angiogenesis. METHODS: HUVEC were used to examine the
      effects of Sb on signaling and on capillary tube formation (using the ECMatrix
      system). The effects of Sb on VEGF-mediated angiogenesis were examined in vivo
      using an adenovirus expressing VEGF-A(164) in the ears of adult nude mice (NuNu).
      The effects of Sb on blood vessel volume branching and density in DSS-induced
      colitis was quantified using VESsel GENeration (VESGEN) software. RESULTS: 1) Sb 
      treatment attenuated weight-loss (p<0.01) and histological damage (p<0.01) in DSS
      colitis. VESGEN analysis of angiogenesis showed significantly increased blood
      vessel density and volume in DSS-treated mice compared to control. Sb treatment
      significantly reduced the neo-vascularization associated with acute DSS colitis
      and accelerated mucosal recovery restoration of the lamina propria capillary
      network to a normal morphology. 2) Sb inhibited VEGF-induced angiogenesis in vivo
      in the mouse ear model. 3) Sb also significantly inhibited angiogenesis in vitro 
      in the capillary tube assay in a dose-dependent manner (p<0.01). 4) In HUVEC, Sb 
      reduced basal VEGFR-2 phosphorylation, VEGFR-2 phosphorylation in response to
      VEGF as well as activation of the downstream kinases PLCgamma and Erk1/2.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the probiotic yeast S boulardii can
      modulate angiogenesis to limit intestinal inflammation and promote mucosal tissue
      repair by regulating VEGFR signaling.

TI  - [Antibiotic-associated diarrhea in clinical practice].
PG  - 85-8
AB  - Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) is considered to mean at least 3 shapeless
      stool episodes within 2 or more consecutive days when using antibacterial agents.
      Due to the fact that antibiotics are used most commonly to treat many diseases,
      AAD is one of the topical problems for different clinical specialists. There has 
      recently been increased interest in this condition due to its higher morbidity
      and mortality rates and the emergence of novel treatment-resistant virulent
      strains of Clostridium difficile 027 and 078/126. The paper discusses the
      possible risk of developing AAD depending on the class of the antibiotic used, as
      well as the mechanisms of its development. Infectious diarrhea most frequently
      results from bacterial overgrowth due to that the obligate intestinal microflora 
      is suppressed by antibacterial drugs. C. difficile, Clostridium perfringers,
      Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp., Klebsiella oxytoca, and Candida spp. are 
      etiological factors in the development of this diarrhea. The severest intestinal 
      lesions include pseudomembranous colitis (PMC) caused by C. difficile. The
      clinical and endoscopic picture and methods for the diagnosis and treatment of
      PMC are described. Therapy for this menacing condition is traditionally based on 
      the use of metronidazole and vancomycin. In 2011, the US Food and Drug
      Administration approved the new drug fidaxomycin whose superiority over
      vancomycin has been demonstrated by a recurrence criterion. The paper discusses
      in detail other treatment options, including the use of probiotics.

PG  - 15-9
AB  - The pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease is still incompletely
      understood. While the development of the immune system and the establishment of
      the microflora take place during infancy young patients often have a more severe 
      and extensive disease. The differences in composition and concentration of
      intestinal microbiota and aberrant immune responses towards the luminal bacteria 
      prompted the concept of an 'ecological' approach to control the disease course.
      Probiotics, living, non pathogenic micro organisms with a beneficial effect on
      the host, and prebiotics, oligosaccharides promoting the growth of the beneficial
      microflora, have been studied to this effect. Results have so far been
      disappointing for Crohn's disease but encouraging for ulcerative colitis. An
      overview of studies using probiotics in adults or children and a perspective on
      specific pediatric issues is provided in this review.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (F. prausnitzii) is a common
      anaerobic bacteria colonized in the human gut and inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) patients are usually lack of F. prausnitzii. The aims of this study were to
      evaluate the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory capacity of F. prausnitzii by
      comparing it with Bifidobacterium longum (B. longum) in both cellular and animal 
      experiments. METHODS: Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and 2, 4, 
      6-trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis rat models were treated
      with F. prausnitzii, B. longum, F. prausnitzii supernatant or F. prausnitzii
      medium, respectively. Interleukin (IL)-10, TGF-beta1 and IL-12p70 in human PBMCs 
      culture supernatant and rat blood serum were detected. The frequency of
      CD25(+)Foxp3(+)Treg in human PBMCs, rat PBMCs and rat splenocytes were
      investigated. Besides, the T-bet, GATA-3, ROR-gammat and Foxp3 mRNA in human
      PBMCs, histopathologic characteristics of the intestinal mucosal and weight loss 
      in the rat models were examined. RESULTS: F. prausnitzii, B. longum and F.
      prausnitzii supernatant clearly facilitated the induction of IL-10 and TGF-beta1,
      while induced relatively mild production of IL-12p70 in both cellular and animal 
      models. The F. prausnitzii, B. longum and supernatant differed in their capacity 
      to induce T-bet, GATA-3 and ROR-gammat mRNA expression in human PBMCs (both
      bacterial strains inhibited the expression of ROR-gammat while supernatant
      inhibited the T-bet and GATA-3). However, all of them induced the Foxp3 and Treg 
      production and ameliorated the TNBS-induced colitis. In addition, F. prausnitzii 
      supernatant exhibited the supreme anti-inflammatory capacity. CONCLUSIONS: F.
      prausnitzii and its unidentified metabolites in the supernatant are promising
      candidates in treating IBD, and further research remains necessary to elucidate
      the safety, efficacy, optimum and mechanism of this bacterium in the clinical
      practice.

PG  - 341-51
LID - 10.1586/egh.13.18 [doi]
AB  - The clinical management of ulcerative colitis (UC) involves first treating the
      acute symptoms to induce remission, and then successfully maintaining it. Oral
      5-aminosalicylic acids are safe and useful for maintaining remission in patients 
      with UC. In terms of adherence, a once-daily form of 5-aminosalicylic acid is
      superior in maintaining remission as compared with split dosing. Patients at high
      risk of relapse may be candidates for treatment with thiopurines and/or biologics
      in the early stages of UC. Calcineurin inhibitors, such as cyclosporine and
      tacrolimus, are effective for severe, steroid-refractory UC patients. It is
      suggested that these patients use thiopurines as their maintenance therapy once
      they achieve remission with calcineurin inhibitors. Recent studies have confirmed
      that biologics are effective for inducing clinical and endoscopic remission of
      UC, and thus they may improve long-term prognosis of UC.

TI  - [Efficacy of probiotics on ulcerative colitis and its mechanism].
PG  - 336-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of probiotics on the treatment outcomes of
      ulcerative colitis, and explore its possible mechanism. METHODS: According to the
      table of random number, 60 ulcerative colitis patients in our hospital were
      enrolled prospectively and divided into 3 groups: Golden Bifid group, Changmei
      group, combination group (Golden+ Changmei). Patients in Golden Bifid group
      received Golden Bifid 2.0 g, bid, those in Changmei group received Changmei 1.0
      g, tid, and those in combination group received the above two drugs for 24
      months. The clinical symptom score, colon mucosa inflammation score and
      endoscopic grade score were calculated and compared. IL-10 in mucosa and serum
      was determined by immunohistochemistry and double-antibody sandwich ELISA.
      RESULTS: In combined group after 24 months of treatment, clinical symptom score
      (12.5+/-2.1 vs. 2.3+/-0.8, P=0.016), endoscopic classification score (3.02+/-0.17
      vs. 0.25+/-0.13, P=0.032), inflammatory reaction score (2.63+/-0.19 vs.
      0.77+/-0.16, P=0.028) were significantly higher than those before treatment.
      While the scores differences of before and after treatment in Gold Bifid group
      and Changmei group were not statistically significant (P>0.05). IL-10 in serum
      [(17.4+/-2.2) ng/L vs. (12.8+/-2.2) ng/L, P=0.015] and colon mucosa [85% (17/20) 
      vs. 55% (11/20), P=0.026] in combination group were significantly higher than
      those before treatment. The differences in IL-10 expression level before and
      after treatment were not statistically significant in the Gold Bifid group and
      Changmei group (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Golden Bifid combined with Changmei as
      microbial ecological agents has a positive efficacy on mild to moderate
      ulcerative colitis, which may be associated with the up-regulation of IL-10
      expression.

AB  - Recent advances in parallel genomic processing and computational mapping have
      been applied to the native human microbial environment to provide a new
      understanding of the role of the microbiome in health and disease. In particular,
      studies of the distal gut microbiome have proposed that changes in gut microbiota
      are related to obesity, the metabolic syndrome, and Western diet. We examined the
      changes in the distal gut microbiome composition as it relates to the lean and
      obese phenotypes, particularly after surgical weight loss. A PubMed search of
      publications from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2012, used the search
      terms weight, obesity, microbiome, and bariatric surgery. We included studies
      that provided information on subjects' weight and/or body mass index and a formal
      assessment of the microbiome. Certain bacteria, specifically the archaeon
      Methanobrevibacter smithii, have enhanced ability to metabolize dietary
      substrate, thereby increasing host energy intake and weight gain. With weight
      loss, there is a decrease in the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes phyla. One 
      major finding from microbial sequencing analyses after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass
      is the comparative overabundance of Proteobacteria in the distal gut microbiome, 
      which is distinct from the changes seen in weight loss without Roux-en-Y gastric 
      bypass. This review provides the practicing surgeon with (1) an update on the
      state of a rapidly innovating branch of clinical bioinformatics, specifically,
      the microbiome; (2) a new understanding of the microbiome changes after Roux-en-Y
      gastric bypass and weight loss; and (3) a basis for understanding further
      clinical applications of studies of the distal gut microbiome, such as in Crohn
      disease, ulcerative colitis, and infectious colitis.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a debilitating and widespread immune-mediated
      illness characterized by excessive inflammatory and effector mucosal responses
      leading to tissue destruction at the gastrointestinal tract. Interactions among
      the immune system, the commensal microbiota and the host genotype are thought to 
      underlie the pathogenesis of IBD. However, the precise etiology of IBD remains
      unknown. Diet-induced changes in the composition of the gut microbiome can
      modulate the induction of regulatory versus effector immune responses at the gut 
      mucosa and improve health outcomes. Therefore, manipulation of gut microbiota
      composition and the local production of microbial-derived metabolites by using
      prebiotics, probiotics and dietary fibers is being explored as a promising avenue
      of prophylactic and therapeutic intervention against gut inflammation. Prebiotics
      and fiber carbohydrates are fermented by resident microflora into short chain
      fatty acids (SCFAs) in the colon. SCFAs then activate peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma, a nuclear transcription factor with 
      widely demonstrated anti-inflammatory efficacy in experimental IBD. The
      activation of PPARgamma by naturally ocurring compounds such as conjugated
      linoleic acid, pomegranate seed oil-derived punicic acid, eleostearic acid and
      abscisic acid has been explored as nutritional interventions that suppress
      colitis by directly modulating the host immune response. The aim of this review
      is to summarize the status of innovative nutritional interventions against
      gastrointestinal inflammation, their proposed mechanisms of action, preclinical
      and clinical efficacy as well as bioinformatics and computational modeling
      approaches that accelerate discovery in nutritional and mucosal immunology
      research.

PG  - 787-96
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2012-302504 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics are derived from traditional fermented foods, from beneficial
      commensals or from the environment. They act through diverse mechanisms affecting
      the composition or function of the commensal microbiota and by altering host
      epithelial and immunological responses. Certain probiotic interventions have
      shown promise in selected clinical conditions where aberrant microbiota have been
      reported, such as atopic dermatitis, necrotising enterocolitis, pouchitis and
      possibly irritable bowel syndrome. However, no studies have been conducted that
      can causally link clinical improvements to probiotic-induced microbiota changes. 
      Whether a disease-prone microbiota pattern can be remodelled to a more robust,
      resilient and disease-free state by probiotic administration remains a key
      unanswered question. Progress in this area will be facilitated by: optimising
      strain, dose and product formulations, including protective commensal species;
      matching these formulations with selectively responsive subpopulations; and
      identifying ways to manipulate diet to modify bacterial profiles and metabolism.

TI  - Fecal transplant in refractory Clostridium difficile colitis.
PG  - 108-15
LID - 10.3238/arztebl.2013.0108 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile infections are becoming more common, more
      severe, and more likely to recur. Conventional treatment with antibiotics often
      fails to eradicate the infection; even when it succeeds, recurrent infection is
      common. Complementary treatment with probiotic agents to reconstitute the
      physiological intestinal flora does not yield any consistent benefit. In recent
      years, fecal transplantation has been used in the English-speaking countries with
      cure rates of about 87%, but the available evidence is limited to large case
      series. No randomized controlled trials have been performed. We present the case 
      of a 73-year-old woman with intractable, recurrent enterocolitis due to
      Clostridium difficile who was successfully treated with fecal transplantation via
      colonoscopy. CASE DESCRIPTION: Upon the completion of antibiotic treatment for a 
      second recurrence of enterocolitis, stool in liquid suspension was introduced
      into the patient's colon through a colonoscope. Prior testing had shown the stool
      donor to be free of acute infection or stool pathogens. The patient was given
      loperamide to prolong contact of the stool transplant with the colonic mucosa.
      She was also treated with Saccharomyces cerevisiae for four weeks. COURSE: There 
      was no clinical or microbiological evidence of a further recurrence of
      enterocolitis for 6 months after transplantation. Stool transplantation had no
      adverse effects. CONCLUSION: This patient had a lasting remission of
      enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile after the treatment described above.
      Fecal transplantation seems to be a safe and highly effective treatment for
      recurrent Clostridium difficile infection. It is unclear whether the
      administration of Saccharomyces cerevisiae confers any additional benefit.

TI  - Lactobacillus GG-fermented milk prevents DSS-induced colitis and regulates
      intestinal epithelial homeostasis through activation of epidermal growth factor
      receptor.
PG  - 105-15
LID - 10.1007/s00394-013-0506-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fermented milk is considered one of the best sources for efficient
      consumption of probiotic strains by hosts to promote good health. The purpose of 
      this study was to investigate the effects of orally administering LGG-fermented
      milk (LGG milk) on intestinal inflammation and injury and to study the mechanisms
      of LGG milk's action. METHODS: LGG milk and non-LGG-fermented milk (non-LGG milk)
      were administered through gavage to mice before and during dextran sodium sulfate
      (DSS)-induced intestinal injury and colitis. Inflammatory/injury score and colon 
      length were assessed. Intestinal epithelial cells were treated with the soluble
      fraction of LGG milk to detect its effects on the epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR) and its downstream target, Akt activation, cytokine-induced
      apoptosis, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced disruption of tight junctions.
      RESULTS: LGG milk treatment significantly reduced DSS-induced colonic
      inflammation and injury, and colon shortening in mice, compared to that in
      non-LGG milk-treated and -untreated mice. The soluble fraction of LGG milk, but
      not non-LGG milk, stimulated the activation of EGFR and Akt in a
      concentration-dependent manner, suppressed cytokine-induced apoptosis, and
      attenuated H2O2-induced disruption of tight junction complex in the intestinal
      epithelial cells. These effects of LGG milk were blocked by the EGFR kinase
      inhibitor. LGG milk, but not non-LGG milk, contained two soluble proteins, p40
      and p75, that have been reported to promote survival and growth of intestinal
      epithelial cells through the activation of EGFR. Depletion of p40 and p75 from
      LGG milk abolished the effects of LGG milk on prevention of cytokine-induced
      apoptosis and H2O2-induced disruption of tight junctions. CONCLUSIONS: These
      results suggest that LGG milk may regulate intestinal epithelial homeostasis and 
      potentially prevent intestinal inflammatory diseases through activation of EGFR
      by LGG-derived proteins.

      view.
PG  - 994-1004
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v19.i7.994 [doi]
AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammation-associated disease of the colon and
      rectum. The onset and progress of the disease are directly influenced by the
      nature of the intestinal microflora, the intestinal barrier function, and the
      immunological responses of the host. The epithelial invasion of pathogenic
      bacteria due to excess contact and/or barrier dysfunction is related to
      inflammation mediated by intestinal immune responses. Although the etiology of UC
      is not clearly understood, recent studies have shown a rising incidence of UC
      worldwide, and this phenomenon is more prominent in Asian countries and in Asian 
      immigrants in Western countries. The increased prevalence of UC also contributes 
      to an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer. Environmental factors,
      including changes in dietary habits, have been suggested as major risk factors of
      UC. A systematic review showed a negative association between UC risk and
      vegetable intake, whereas total fat, omega-6 fatty acids and meat intake were
      positively associated with an increased risk of UC. Individual dietary factors
      and energy balance have been suggested as having important roles in inducing
      changes in the microbial population and intestinal barrier integrity and in
      regulating inflammatory immune responses, directly or indirectly. Excess energy
      intake is now known to increase pathogenic microbial populations. Likewise, the
      application of appropriate probiotics may reverse the pathogenic progression of
      the disease. In the meantime, dietary anti-inflammatory compounds, including
      omega-3 fatty acids and other phytochemicals, may directly suppress inflammatory 
      responses in the course of UC development. In this review, the increased
      prevalence of UC and its management are interpreted from the standpoint of
      nutritional modulation to regulate the intestinal microflora population,

AB  - Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 and adherent-invasive Escherichia
      coli are two groups of enteric bacterial pathogens associated with haemorrhagic
      colitis and Crohn's Disease, respectively. Bacterial contact with host epithelial
      cells stimulates an immediate innate immune response designed to combat
      infection. In this study, immune responses of human epithelial cells to
      pathogens, either alone or in combination with probiotic bacteria were studied.
      Industrially prepared Lactobacillus helveticus strain R0052 was first examined by
      microarray analysis and then compared to broth-grown strains of R0052 and
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG using quantitative realt-time polymerase chain 
      reaction. Results showed host immune activation responses increased following
      pathogen exposure, which were differentially ameliorated using probiotics
      depending on both the preparation of probiotics employed and conditions of
      exposure. These findings provide additional support for the concept that specific
      probiotic strains serve as a promising option for use in preventing the risk of
      enteric bacterial infections.

AB  - Probiotic strains of Lactobacillus are currently used in a variety of clinical
      practices with limited evidence to support their use. Lactobacillus species are a
      normal part of gastrointestinal flora, and bacteremia with probiotic strains of
      Lactobacillus is very uncommon. We describe a case of Lactobacillus bacteremia in
      a 17-year-old boy with ulcerative colitis managed with systemic corticosteroids
      and infliximab, who presented with fever to 102 degrees F, flushing, and chills 1
      week after starting Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG probiotics. Initial blood culture 
      on day 2 of his fever was positive for Lactobacillus, however, subsequent blood
      cultures on day 3 and 5 were negative. He was treated empirically with
      antibiotics for 5 days and defervesced by day 8 of his illness. 16 S rRNA
      sequence analysis identified the organism from the patient's blood culture and
      probiotic capsule as L. rhamnosus with a 99.78% match for both the strains. This 
      case report highlights the potential risk of Lactobacillus bacteremia in
      immunosuppressed patients with severe active ulcerative colitis.

AB  - After a short overview of the history of probiotics, the author presents the
      development of human intestinal microflora based on the newest genetic data and
      the microbiological features of main probiotics. The indications of probiotic
      administration have been defined and extended in recent years. The author reviews
      significant results of probiotic treatment in some gastrointestinal diseases
      based on meta-analytical data. Probiotics are useful in preventing and treating
      diarrhoea caused by antibiotics and Clostridium difficile caused diarrhoea. In
      the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection, preparations containing certain
      Lactobacillus,Bifidobacterium strains or Saccaromyces boulardii could enhance by 
      5-10% the rate of successful eradication and reduce the incidence and severity of
      the side effects. Some symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and thus the quality 
      of life can be improved by probiotics. Their beneficial effect in ulcerative
      colitis was proven, while in Crohn's disease has not yet been defined. The use of
      probiotics is not included in guidelines, with the exception of the Maastricht
      IV/Florence consensus. For each disease it is advisable to use probiotics
      containing strains only with proven beneficial effect. The efficiency of
      preparations containing mixed strains has not yet been properly investigated. The
      author reviews the rare but potentially serious side effects of probiotics. In
      Hungary, there are many probiotic preparations available which can be purchased
      in pharmacies without prescription: their use is more empirical than
      evidence-based. The European Food Safety Authority has recently rejected claims
      for probiotics to be classed as medicines given the lack of convincing evidence
      on the effects of probiotics on human health and well-being. Clearly, further
      research is needed to collect evidence which could be incorporated into the
      international guidelines.

PG  - 184-9

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is direct evidence that the pathogenesis of inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) involves the gastrointestinal microbiota and some evidence
      that the microbiota might also play a similar role in irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS). The aim of this article is to review the emerging evidence for the
      mechanisms and effectiveness of probiotics in the management of these disorders. 
      RECENT FINDINGS: The composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota is strongly
      influenced by factors including age, diet and disease. Probiotics may be
      effective through their impact on the host gastrointestinal microbiota and
      promotion of mucosal immunoregulation. Probiotics are considered to be well
      tolerated, although the quality of studies and health claims has been variable.
      There are many short-term studies demonstrating the effectiveness of probiotics
      in IBS, although recommendations should be made for specific strains and for
      specific symptoms. Within IBD, a number of trials have shown the benefits of a
      range of probiotics in pouchitis and in ulcerative colitis, although current
      evidence in Crohn's disease is less promising. SUMMARY: Clearly, some probiotics 
      have considerable potential in the management of IBS and IBD; however, the
      benefits are strain specific. High-quality trials of probiotics in
      gastrointestinal disorders as well as laboratory investigations of their
      mechanism of action are required in order to understand who responds and why.

PG  - 1745-52
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2012-303611 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Many species within the phylum Firmicutes are thought to exert
      anti-inflammatory effects. We quantified bacteria belonging to the genus
      Butyricicoccus in stools of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's
      disease (CD). We evaluated the effect of Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum in a rat
      colitis model and analysed the ability to prevent cytokine-induced increases in
      epithelial permeability. DESIGN: A genus-specific quantitative PCR was used for
      quantification of Butyricicoccus in stools from patients with UC or CD and
      healthy subjects. The effect of B pullicaecorum on trinitrobenzenesulfonic
      (TNBS)-induced colitis was assessed and the effect of B pullicaecorum culture
      supernatant on epithelial barrier function was investigated in vitro. RESULTS:
      The average number of Butyricicoccus in stools from patients with UC and CD in
      active (UC: 8.61 log10/g stool; CD: 6.58 log10/g stool) and remission phase (UC: 
      8.69 log10/g stool; CD: 8.38 log10/g stool) was significantly lower compared with
      healthy subjects (9.32 log10/g stool) and correlated with disease activity in CD.
      Oral administration of B pullicaecorum resulted in a significant protective
      effect based on macroscopic and histological criteria and decreased intestinal
      myeloperoxidase (MPO), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin
      (IL)-12 levels. Supernatant of B pullicaecorum prevented the loss of
      transepithelial resistance (TER) and the increase in IL-8 secretion induced by
      TNFalpha and interferon gamma (IFN gamma) in a Caco-2 cell model. CONCLUSIONS:
      Patients with inflammatory bowel disease have lower numbers of Butyricicoccus
      bacteria in their stools. Administration of B pullicaecorum attenuates
      TNBS-induced colitis in rats and supernatant of B pullicaecorum cultures
      strengthens the epithelial barrier function by increasing the TER.

TI  - Cutting edge: chemoprevention of colorectal neoplasia in inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 1-7
AB  - Colitis-associated cancer represents a long-standing problem, with two new
      factors adding to its importance: the diffusion of inflammatory bowel disease in 
      developing countries, and the increased availability of effective drugs that
      control ulcerative colitis delaying or abrogating the need for a curative
      colectomy. The consolidated evidence that inflammation is the unique variable
      that factors in colitic cancer development has conferred impetus to the search
      and release of anti-inflammatory/immune suppressive molecules to pursue the goal 
      of cancer chemoprevention. Cutting-edge research has provided breakthrough
      insights into the mechanism of the chemopreventive actions of mesalamines,
      thiopurines, and probiotics, and we expand on these topics. Despite these
      advancements, bedside evidence is still mixed and calls for further scrutiny.
      Nowadays, the clinician must continue to rely on classic preventive measures such
      as surveillance colonoscopy, and the early and aggressive use of drugs that
      permit to keep the degree of mucosal inflammation to a minimum.

TI  - Clostridium difficile colitis: review of the therapeutic approach.
PG  - 385-94
LID - 10.1097/MJT.0b013e318245992d [doi]
AB  - Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the leading cause of
      antibiotic-associated and nosocomial infectious diarrhea. Presenting as
      clostridium difficile colitis, it is a significant cause of morbidity and
      mortality. Metronidazole is regarded as the agent of choice for CDl therapy and
      also for the first recurrence in most patients with mild to moderate CDI.
      Vancomycin is recommended as an initial therapy for patients with severe CDI.
      With recent Food and Drug Administration-approval fidaxomicin is available for
      clinical use and is as effective as vancomycin with lower relapse rates.
      Rifaximin and fecal bacteriotherapy are alternative approaches in patients with
      severe or refractory CDI, before surgical intervention. Antibiotic research is
      ongoing to add potential new drugs such as teicoplanin, ramoplanin, fusidic acid,
      nitazoxanide, rifampin, bacitracin to our armamentarium. Role of toxin-binding
      agents is still questionable. Monoclonal antibody and intravenous immunoglobulin 
      are still investigational therapies that could be promising options. The ongoing 
      challenges in the treatment of CDI include management of recurrence and presence 
      of resistance strains such as NAP1/BI/027, but early recognition of surgical
      candidates can potentially decrease mortality in CDI.

TI  - Exclusive elemental diet impacts on the gastrointestinal microbiota and improves 
      symptoms in patients with chronic pouchitis.
PG  - 460-6
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2012.07.009 [doi]
LID - S1873-9946(12)00320-0 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment resistant chronic pouchitis causes significant morbidity.
      Elemental diet is effective treatment for Crohn's disease. Since pouchitis shares
      some similarities to Crohn's disease we hypothesised that elemental diet may be
      an effective treatment. METHOD: Seven pouchitis patients (with ulcerative
      colitis) were studied. All had active pouchitis with a pouch disease activity
      index (PDAI) >/=7. Exclusion criteria were recent NSAIDs, antibiotics or
      probiotics. Sufficient elemental diet to achieve energy requirements was
      provided. Flexible-pouchoscopy was performed, and the Cleveland Global Quality of
      Life score (CGQoL), Pouch Disease Activity Index (PDAI) and BMI were recorded at 
      baseline and following 28 days of elemental diet. Faecal samples were also
      collected at these time points and analysed for major bacterial groups using
      culture independent fluorescence in situ hybridisation. Data were analysed using 
      Wilcoxon's signed-rank test. RESULTS: Following 28 days of exclusive elemental
      diet, median stool frequency decreased from 12 to 6 per day (p=0.028), median
      clinical PDAI decreased from 4 to 1 (p=0.039). There was no significant
      difference in quality of life scores or PDAI before and following treatment.
      There was a trend towards an increase in the concentration of Clostridium
      coccoides-Eubacterium rectale (median 7.9 to 8.5 log(1)(0)/g, p=0.08) following
      exclusive elemental diet. CONCLUSION: Treatment with four weeks elemental diet
      appeared to improve the symptoms of chronic pouchitis in some patients but is not
      an effective strategy for inducing remission. Although a potential symptom
      modifier, elemental diet cannot be recommended for the routine treatment of
      active pouchitis.

TI  - [Diverticulitis--conservative therapy].
PG  - e63-9
LID - 10.1055/s-0031-1271381 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diverticulitis due to diverticulosis of the colon is a common
      clinical problem with a high morbidity and socio-economic consequences. Frequent 
      clinical signs are flatulence, abdominal pain, stool problems which may often be 
      misinterpreted as the symptoms of an irritable bowel or a colitis. Accordingly,
      the diagnostic work-up must be adequate to allow for the stage-adapted planning
      and performance of the therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The following questions
      will be addressed in this review: What do we need to clarify diagnosis? Which
      antibiotics should be used? What is the best conservative approach for treatment?
      RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Basic conservative therapy consists of systemic
      antibiosis which can be extended by a topical antibiosis, and administration of
      aspirin as well as probiotics. The indications for a specific therapy is made on 
      an individual basis according to stage (Hansen and Stock). Above all, a "team
      approach" and close communication between gastroenterologists and surgeons are
      mandatory for adequate treatment of these patients.
