TI  - Review-Ulcerative colitis and probiotics: An overview.
PG  - 1877-1880
AB  - Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the large intestine whose
      effects are bloody diarrhea, cramping and bloating. The disease is usually
      relapsing and remitting. However, the cause of ulcerative colitis is not yet
      known. Due to this reason, finding an effective treatment has been a great
      challenge. The suggested medical treatment is usually composed of two portions;
      keeping the flare up from happening and treating the flare up when it has
      happened. Active flare ups are treated with corticosteroids. There are several
      hypothesis which suggest that ulcerative colitis could be due to the micro flora 
      present in gut. For this reason, several researchers tried to modify the gut
      microflora with probiotics. However, there is no probiotics found that can induce
      emission faster than the placebo. The ulcerative colitis patients taking
      probiotics showed fewer and less severe symptoms during the flare up. This means 
      that even though the probiotics did not end up the flare up faster, it slowed up 
      the severity of the symptoms of the patients.

AB  - AIM: Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are two important chronic
      Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) characterized by prominent intestinal
      inflammation. Probiotics are the bacteria that promote the host health by its
      immunomodulatory activity. The present study investigated the correlation between
      in vitro adhesion and immunomodulatory properties, and to assess the therapeutic 
      potential of Bifidobacterium bifidum 231 (BIF 231), a new strain of probiotic in 
      ulcerative colitis in rats. METHODS: In vitro adhesion assays and
      immunomodulatory effect of BIF 231 on interleukins (IL-1beta and IL-10) in IEC-6 
      cell lines were quantified by gram staining, scanning electron microscopy and
      q-PCR respectively. Colitis was induced by intra-rectal instillation of
      trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid. Colitis was evaluated by alterations in colon gross
      morphology, histologically and biochemically. Colonic interleukin-1beta
      (IL-1beta) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) mRNA and protein expression were assessed
      by q-PCR, ELISA and western blot. RESULTS: BIF 231 showed better adhesion and
      immunomodulation by up-regulating IL-10 levels in IEC-6 cell lines. In vivo
      studies with treatment of BIF 231 (1.4x10(11) CFU/rat/day) revealed
      anti-inflammatory effects both macroscopically and histologically. BIF 231
      lowered TBARS, nitric oxide and augmented GSH levels. BIF 231 treatment to
      colitic rats down regulated IL-1beta levels with concurrent increase in IL-10
      levels. CONCLUSIONS: BIF 231 exerted beneficial in vitro adhesion and
      immunomodulatory properties which facilitated the recovery of the damaged tissue 
      in TNBS-induced colitis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The ESPEN guideline presents a multidisciplinary focus on clinical 
      nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODOLOGY: The guideline is
      based on extensive systematic review of the literature, but relies on expert
      opinion when objective data were lacking or inconclusive. The conclusions and 64 
      recommendations have been subject to full peer review and a Delphi process in
      which uniformly positive responses (agree or strongly agree) were required.
      RESULTS: IBD is increasingly common and potential dietary factors in its
      aetiology are briefly reviewed. Malnutrition is highly prevalent in IBD -
      especially in Crohn's disease. Increased energy and protein requirements are
      observed in some patients. The management of malnutrition in IBD is considered
      within the general context of support for malnourished patients. Treatment of
      iron deficiency (parenterally if necessary) is strongly recommended. Routine
      provision of a special diet in IBD is not however supported. Parenteral nutrition
      is indicated only when enteral nutrition has failed or is impossible. The
      recommended perioperative management of patients with IBD undergoing surgery
      accords with general ESPEN guidance for patients having abdominal surgery.
      Probiotics may be helpful in UC but not Crohn's disease. Primary therapy using
      nutrition to treat IBD is not supported in ulcerative colitis, but is moderately 
      well supported in Crohn's disease, especially in children where the adverse
      consequences of steroid therapy are proportionally greater. However, exclusion
      diets are generally not recommended and there is little evidence to support any
      particular formula feed when nutritional regimens are constructed. CONCLUSIONS:
      Available objective data to guide nutritional support and primary nutritional
      therapy in IBD are presented as 64 recommendations, of which 9 are very strong
      recommendations (grade A), 22 are strong recommendations (grade B) and 12 are
      based only on sparse evidence (grade 0); 21 recommendations are good practice
      points (GPP).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics are widely used for the induction and maintenance of
      remission in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and pouchitis. There are a large
      number of meta-analyses (MAs)/ systematic reviews (SRs) on this subject, the
      methodological quality of which has not been evaluated. OBJECTIVES: This study
      aimed to evaluate the methodological quality of and summarize the evidence
      obtained from MAs/SRs of probiotic treatments for IBD and pouchitis patients.
      METHODS: The PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and China National Knowledge
      Infrastructure (CNKI) databases were searched to identify Chinese and English
      language MAs/SRs of the use of probiotics for IBD and pouchitis. The Assessment
      of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) scale was used to assess the
      methodological quality of the studies. RESULTS: A total of 36 MAs/SRs were
      evaluated. The AMSTAR scores of the included studies ranged from 1 to 10, and the
      average score was 5.81. According to the Canadian Agency for Drugs and
      Technologies in Health, 4 articles were classified as high quality, 24 articles
      were classified as moderate quality, and 8 articles were classified as low
      quality. Most of the MAs/SRs suggested that probiotics had potential benefits for
      patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), but failed to show effectiveness in the
      induction and maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease (CD). The probiotic
      preparation VSL#3 may play a beneficial role in pouchitis. CONCLUSION: The
      overall methodological quality of the current MAs/SRs in the field of probiotics 
      for IBD and pouchitis was found to be low to moderate. More MAs/SRs of high
      quality are required to support using probiotics to treat IBD and pouchitis.

AB  - Among the neoplasias, colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer
      death in men and women. The increasing incidence of this type of cancer is due to
      the increase in the population's life expectancy, by the increase in chronic
      inflammatory bowel diseases, primarily ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease,
      and the change in eating habits. The American Cancer Society (2011) shows that
      diet might be responsible for approximately 30% of cancer cases in developed
      countries, moreover when considering only colorectal cancer, the number can reach
      30% to 50%. Probiotics are effective in the prevention and treatment of many
      bowel diseases as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), diarrhea, irritable bowel
      syndrome, gluten intolerance, gastroenteritis, Helicobacter pyloriinfection, and 
      colon cancer. Classical examples are strains from the Lactobacillus, and
      Bifidobacteriumgenus that have probiotic proprieties with a potential use in the 
      prophylaxis, as well as in the treatment of a variety of gastrointestinal tract
      disorders. Researchers are focusing on extremely important studies regarding the 
      possibility of using probiotics to promote a balanced microbiota composition, and
      a sufficient immunological surveillance system as a way to prevent cancer.
      Considering the fact that the human intestines host 100 trillion bacteria,
      including more than 1,000 species, there is still need to perform more in depth
      investigations in order to find probiotics with potential to prevent, and treat
      cancerous diseases, adding a very promising effect to this already successful
      panorama. This revision aims to conduct a review of the most recent studies
      correlating probiotics and its cancer preventing and treatment potential.

AB  - Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease with 
      detrimental sequela. In many patients, PSC progresses to end-stage liver disease 
      and hepatobiliary cancer. There is no medical therapy that is proven to halt or
      reverse the progression of PSC. Approximately 70 to 80% of PSC patients have
      inflammatory bowel disease, usually ulcerative colitis. The etiology of PSC is
      poorly understood. Several lines of evidence suggest that the intestinal
      microbiota plays an important role in the etiopathogenesis of PSC. Stemming from 
      this theory, several antibiotics have been tried in PSC, some of which had shown 
      promising results. Fecal microbiota transplantation is a novel therapy, and is
      currently being investigated as a potential therapeutic strategy in PSC along
      with probiotics. In this article, the authors discuss the current knowledge of
      the intestinal microbiota in PSC.

TI  - Clostridium difficile infection: Updates in management.
PG  - 3-10
LID - 10.1007/s12664-016-0719-z [doi]
AB  - Clostridium difficile was first identified in 1978 as a diarrhea-causing
      bacterium in humans. In the last three decades, C. difficile infection (CDI) has 
      reached an epidemic state, both in health care and community settings worldwide. 
      There has been substantial progress in the field of CDI, including identification
      of novel risk factors, presence of CDI in individuals not considered at risk
      previously, and treatment options including new drugs, monoclonal antibodies, and
      fecal microbiota transplantation. This review discusses epidemiology, novel and
      traditional risk factors, and updates in management for CDI.

TI  - Fermented Herbal Formulas KIOM-MA128 Ameliorate IL-6-Induced Intestinal Barrier
      Dysfunction in Colon Cancer Cell Line.
PG  - 6189590
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) comprises Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative
      colitis (UC). IBD increases the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), depending on the
      extent and duration of intestinal inflammation. Increased IL-6 expression has
      been reported in IBD patients, which may be associated with intestinal barrier
      function through discontinuous tight junction (TJ). KIOM-MA is a specific agent
      for allergic diseases and cancer, and it is composed of several plants; these
      herbs have been used in traditional oriental medicine. We fermented KIOM-MA, the 
      product of KIOM-MA128, using probiotics to improve the therapeutic efficacy via
      the absorption and bioavailability of the active ingredients. In this study, we
      demonstrated that KIOM-MA/MA128 exhibited anticolitis effects via the modulation 
      of TJ protein. Interleukin-6 resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the TER and
      an increase in the FITC-dextran permeability; however, pretreatment with 400
      microg/ml KIOM-MA/MA128 resulted in a significant increase in the TER and a
      decrease in the FITC-dextran permeability via IL-6 induction. Furthermore,
      protein and mRNA TJ levels remained stable after pretreatment with 400 microg/ml 
      KIOM-MA/MA128. Moreover, KIOM-MA/MA128 suppressed the expression of PLCgamma1 and
      PKC. Taken together, these findings suggest novel information and clue of the
      anticolitis effects of KIOM-MA128 via regulation of tight junction.

TI  - Liver abscess and bacteremia caused by lactobacillus: role of probiotics? Case
      report and review of the literature.
PG  - 138
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactobacilli are non-spore forming, lactic acid producing,
      gram-positive rods. They are a part of the normal gastrointestinal and
      genitourinary microbiota and have rarely been reported to be the cause of
      infections. Lactobacilli species are considered non-pathogenic organisms and have
      been used as probiotics to prevent antibiotic associated diarrhea. There are
      sporadic reported cases of infections related to lactobacilli containing
      probiotics. CASE PRESENTATION: In this paper we discuss a case of an 82 year old 
      female with liver abscess and bacteremia from lactobacillus after using
      probiotics containing lactobacilli in the course of her treatment of Clostridium 
      difficile colitis. The Lactobacillus strain identification was not performed and 
      therefore, both commensal microbiota and the probiotic product should be
      considered as possible sources of the strain. CONCLUSION: Lactobacilli can lead
      to bacteremia and liver abscesses in some susceptible persons and greater
      awareness of this potential side effect is warranted with the increasing use of
      probiotics containing lactobacilli.

TI  - Isoliquiritigenin decreases the incidence of colitis-associated colorectal cancer
      by modulating the intestinal microbiota.
PG  - 85318-85331
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.13347 [doi]
AB  - Imbalances in intestinal bacteria correlate with colitis-associated colorectal
      cancer (CAC). Traditional Chinese medicines have been used to adjust the gut
      microbiota, and isoliquiritigenin (ISL), a flavonoid extracted from licorice, has
      shown antitumor efficacy. In this study, the effects of ISL on CAC development
      and the gut microbiota were evaluated using an azoxymethane and dextran sulphate 
      sodium (AOM/DSS)-induced mouse model of CAC (CACM). Histopathological analysis
      suggested that ISL reduced tumor incidence in vivo. Moreover, high-throughput
      sequencing and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) studies
      of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene revealed that the structure of the gut microbial
      community shifted significantly following AOM/DSS treatment, and that effect was 
      alleviated by treatment with high-dose ISL (150 mg/kg). Compared to the
      microbiota in the control mice (CK), the levels of Bacteroidetes decreased and
      the levels of Firmicutes increased during CAC development. ISL reversed the
      imbalance at the phylum level and altered the familial constituents of the gut
      microbiota. Specifically, the abundance of Helicobacteraceae increased after
      treatment with high-dose ISL, while the abundance of Lachnospiraceae and
      Rikenellaceae decreased. At the genus level, ISL reduced the abundance of
      opportunistic pathogens (Escherichia and Enterococcus), and increased the levels 
      of probiotics, particularly butyrate-producing bacteria (Butyricicoccus,
      Clostridium, and Ruminococcus). Thus, ISL protects mice from AOM/DSS-induced CAC,
      and ISL and the gut microbiota may have synergistic anti-cancer effects.

TI  - Anti-inflammaging effects of Lactobacillus brevis OW38 in aged mice.
PG  - 707-718
AB  - In the present study, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains were collected from
      kimchi and were screened to isolate strains that inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
      production by Escherichia coli and p16 expression and nuclear factor-kappa B
      (NF-kappaB) activation in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Oral administration of
      Lactobacillus brevis OW38 (1x10(9) cfu/mouse) to aged mice (male, 18 months old) 
      for 8 weeks reduced the LPS level in colon fluid and blood. In addition, OW38
      treatment also reduced the ratio of Firmicutes or Proteobacteria to
      Bacteroidetes, which was significantly higher in aged mice than in young mice.
      Treatment with OW38 in aged mice inhibited the expression of inflammatory
      markers, such as myeloperoxidase, tumour necrosis factor (TNF), and interleukin
      (IL)-1beta, and inhibited NF-kappaB activation. Furthermore, it induced the
      expression of colonic tight junction proteins zonula occludens-1, occludin, and
      claudin-1. OW38 treatment also suppressed the expression of senescence markers
      p16, p53, and SAMHD1 in the colon and the hippocampus of aged mice. In addition, 
      it significantly restored spontaneous alternation as well as the expression of
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor and doublecortin in aged mice compared to that 
      in young mice (P<0.05). Based on these findings, we conclude that OW38 treatment 
      may ameliorate aging-associated colitis and memory impairment by inhibiting gut
      microbiota LPS production, NF-kappaB activation, and p16 expression.

TI  - Probiotics, fibre and herbal medicinal products for functional and inflammatory
      bowel disorders.
PG  - 1426-1449
LID - 10.1111/bph.13632 [doi]
AB  - Functional bowel disorders (FBD), mainly irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and
      functional constipation (FC, also called chronic idiopathic constipation), are
      very common worldwide. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative
      colitis and Crohn's disease, although less common, has a strong impact on
      patients' quality of life, as well as being highly expensive for our healthcare. 
      A definite cure for those disorders is still yet to come. Over the years, several
      therapeutic approaches complementary or alternative to traditional
      pharmacological treatments, including probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, fibre
      and herbal medicinal products, have been investigated for the management of both 
      groups of diseases. However, most available studies are biased by several
      drawbacks, including small samples and poor methodological quality. Probiotics,
      in particular Saccharomyces boulardii and Lactobacilli (among which Lactobacillus
      rhamnosus), synbiotics, psyllium, and some herbal medicinal products, primarily
      peppermint oil, seem to be effective in ameliorating IBS symptoms. Synbiotics and
      fibre seem to be beneficial in FC patients. The probiotic combination VSL#3 may
      be effective in inducing remission in patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative
      colitis, in whom Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 seems to be as effective as
      mesalamine in maintaining remission. No definite conclusions can be drawn as to
      the efficacy of fibre and herbal medicinal products in IBD patients due to the
      low number of studies and the lack of randomized controlled trials that replicate
      the results obtained in the individual studies conducted so far. Thus, further,
      well-designed studies are needed to address the real role of these therapeutic
      options in the management of both FBD and IBD. LINKED ARTICLES: This article is

TI  - Role of prebiotics and probiotics in pediatric diseases.
PG  - 487-497
AB  - The increasing knowledge about the composition and activities of the microflora
      has shown the close link between the bacteria and the health of the human
      organism. For this reason it has focused attention on the possibility of
      modulating the gut flora. The use of probiotics and prebiotics has increased
      enormously in recent years, more for real beneficial effects demonstrated in
      patients than for their safety profiles. However, it is recorded an
      indiscriminate use also in conditions in which there are no scientific evidence
      to support. Their use in case of immunocompromised patients or with severe and
      debilitating chronic diseases should be very prudent, because of the risk of
      complications including sepsis. The use of a probiotic cannot ignore the
      knowledge of the genus and species of the strain and in pediatric patients has
      been demonstrated their role for treating acute viral gastroenteritis and
      preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea in healthy children. Moreover
      probiotics are considered as an option for recurrent and relapsing antibiotic
      sensitive pouchitis and in select patients with mild ulcerative colitis. Further 
      studies are needed to evaluate clinical conditions that may require their use and
      to define the optimal doses and intake durations.

      questions to be answered.
PG  - 800-810
LID - 10.1111/1751-2980.12422 [doi]
AB  - Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) exhibit impaired control of the
      microbiome in the gut, and 'dysbiosis' is commonly observed. Western diet is a
      risk factor for the development of IBD, but it may have different effects on gut 
      microbiota between IBD and non-IBD individuals. Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN)
      can induce remission in pediatric Crohn's disease with a decrease in gut
      microbial diversity. Although there are some theoretical benefits, actual
      treatment effects of prebiotics and probiotics in IBD vary. High-quality studies 
      have shown that VSL#3 (a high-potency probiotic medical food containing eight
      different strains) exhibits benefits in treating ulcerative colitis, and gut
      microbial diversity is reduced after treated with VSL#3 in animal models. The
      effect of fecal microbiome transplantation on IBD is controversial. Increasing
      microbial diversity compared with impaired handling of bacteria presents a
      dilemma. Antibiotics are the strongest factors in the reduction of microbiome
      ecological diversity. Some antibiotics may help to induce remission of the
      disease. Microbiome alteration has been suggested to be an intrinsic property of 
      IBD and a potential predictor in diagnosis and prognosis. However, the effects of
      therapeutic modulations are variable; thus, more questions remain to be answered.

TI  - Probiotics and Liver Disease: Where Are We Now and Where Are We Going?
PG  - S188-S190
AB  - Probiotics are live, nonpathogenic bacteria capable of colonizing the colonic
      mucosa. The most common probiotics include strains of Lactobacillus or
      Bifidobacteria, which are part of the normal gastrointestinal microbiota. Initial
      studies of selected probiotic species have suggested potential efficacy in
      several gastrointestinal diseases including inflammatory bowel diseases
      (particularly pouchitis), antibiotic-related diarrhea, Clostridium difficile
      toxin-induced colitis, infectious diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, and
      allergy. The so-called "gut-liver axis" involves complex interaction between the 
      liver parenchyma and gut microbiota. There is growing evidence to suggest that
      alteration in gut microbial components may affect the liver and can be a
      precipitating cofactor in development and modulating of chronic liver damage
      through ethanol, production of ammonia and endotoxin. This may allow for a better
      understanding of its role in the pathogenesis of verities of liver diseases and
      help to identify a microbial target for prevention and treatment of such
      diseases. This paper discusses the growing evidence that highlights the
      relationship between gut microbiota and development, prevention and treatment of 
      numbers of liver diseases.

TI  - The different effects of probiotics treatment on Salmonella-induced interleukin-8
      response in intestinal epithelia cells via PI3K/Akt and NOD2 expression.
PG  - 739-748
AB  - Salmonella spp. remains a major public health problem for the whole world.
      Intestinal epithelial cells serve as an essential component of the innate mucosal
      immune system to defend against Salmonella infection. A substantial amount of
      evidence has accumulated that probiotics can regulate interleukin 8 (IL-8)
      involved in innate immunity. However, the exact effect of probiotics on
      epithelial IL-8 response to Salmonella infection is not well understood.
      Therefore, we investigated the action of probiotics on Salmonella-infected Caco-2
      cells and its novel mechanisms. Two probiotic strains were examined for
      Salmonella-induced IL-8 responses and regulating proteins using Caco-2 cell
      cultures. We demonstrated probiotic, either Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG or
      Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis DSM10140, administered before Salmonella
      infection conferred significantly suppressive effect on Salmonella-induced IL-8
      responses in Caco-2 cells, either in secreted protein or mRNA, via the PI3K/Akt
      signal pathway while probiotic administered after infection enhanced
      Salmonella-induced IL-8 responses via nucleotide-binding oligomerisation
      domain-containing protein 2 expression in membrane. These findings suggest that
      the different regulation of probiotics on Salmonella-induced IL-8 responses in
      Caco-2 cells according to the administered timing supports a rationale for the
      therapeutic use of probiotics in the treatment of Salmonella colitis and
      inflammatory bowel disease. This can explain the reported controversial effect of
      probiotics on these diseases.

AB  - The concept of prebiotics, probiotics, and symbiotics and their use in different 
      situations of daily clinical practice related to clinical nutrition is reviewed, 
      as well as their role in the treatment/prevention of diarrhea (acute, induced by 
      antibiotics, secondary to radiotherapy), inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative
      colitis and pouchitis), in colonic health (constipation, irritable bowel), in
      liver disease (steatosis and minimum encephalopathy), and in intensive care,
      surgical, and liver transplantation. While their effectiveness for preventing
      antibiotic-induced diarrhea and pouchitis in ulcerative colitis appears to be
      shown, additional studies are needed to establish recommendations in most
      clinical settings. The risk of infection associated to use of probiotics is
      relatively low; however, there are selected groups of patients in whom they
      should be used with caution (as jejunum infusion).

TI  - The long-term effects of probiotics in the therapy of ulcerative colitis: A
      clinical study.
PG  - 372-7
LID - 10.5507/bp.2016.044 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Intestinal dysbiosis seems to be the leading cause of inflammatory bowel
      diseases, and probiotics seems to represent the proper support against their
      occurrence. Actually, probiotic blends and anti-inflammatory drugs represent a
      weapon against inflammatory bowel diseases. The present study evaluates the
      long-term (2 years) effects of combination therapy (mesalazine plus a probiotic
      blend of Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium 
      bifidus strain BGN4) on ulcerative colitis activity. METHOD: Sixty patients with 
      moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis were enrolled: 30 of them were treated with
      a single daily oral administration of mesalazine 1200 mg; 30 patients received a 
      single daily oral administration of mesalazine 1200 mg and a double daily
      administration of a probiotic blend of Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus
      acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidus strain BGN4. The treatment was carried
      out for two years and the clinical response evaluated according to the Modified
      Mayo Disease Activity Index. RESULTS: All patients treated with combination
      therapy showed better improvement compared to the controls. In particular, the
      beneficial effects of probiotics were evident even after two years of treatment. 
      CONCLUSIONS: A long-term treatment modality of anti-inflammatory drugs and
      probiotics is viable and could be an alternative to corticosteroids in mild-to
      moderate ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Modulation of microbiota as treatment for intestinal inflammatory disorders: An
      uptodate.
PG  - 7186-202
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i32.7186 [doi]
AB  - Alterations of intestinal microflora may significantly contribute to the
      pathogenesis of different inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. There is
      emerging interest on the role of selective modulation of microflora in inducing
      benefits in inflammatory intestinal disorders, by as probiotics, prebiotics,
      synbiotics, antibiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). To summarize
      recent evidences on microflora modulation in main intestinal inflammatory
      disorders, PubMed was searched using terms microbiota, intestinal flora,
      probiotics, prebiotics, fecal transplantation. More than three hundred articles
      published up to 2015 were selected and reviewed. Randomized placebo-controlled
      trials and meta-analysis were firstly included, mainly for probiotics. A
      meta-analysis was not performed because of the heterogeneity of these studies.
      Most of relevant data derived from studies on probiotics, reporting some efficacy
      in ulcerative colitis and in pouchitis, while disappointing results are available
      for Crohn's disease. Probiotic supplementation may significantly reduce rates of 
      rotavirus diarrhea. Efficacy of probiotics in NSAID enteropathy and irritable
      bowel syndrome is still controversial. Finally, FMT has been recently recognized 
      as an efficacious treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection.
      Modulation of intestinal flora represents a very interesting therapeutic target, 
      although it still deserves some doubts and limitations. Future studies should be 
      encouraged to provide new understanding about its therapeutical role.

TI  - Elucidating the gut microbiome of ulcerative colitis: bifidobacteria as novel
      microbial biomarkers.
LID - 10.1093/femsec/fiw191 [doi]
LID - fiw191 [pii]
AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) is associated with a substantial alteration of specific
      gut commensals, some of which may be involved in microbiota-mediated protection. 
      In this study, microbiota cataloging of UC patients by 16S rRNA microbial
      profiling revealed a marked reduction of bifidobacteria, in particular the
      Bifidobacterium bifidum species, thus suggesting that this taxon plays a
      biological role in the aetiology of UC. We investigated this further through an
      in vivo trial by testing the effects of oral treatment with B. bifidum PRL2010 in
      a wild-type murine colitis model. TNBS-treated mice receiving 10(9) cells of B.
      bifidum PRL2010 showed a marked reduction of all colitis-associated histological 
      indices as well as maintenance of mucosal integrity as it was shown by the
      increase in the expression of many tight junction-encoding genes. The protective 
      role of B. bifidum PRL2010, as well as its sortase-dependent pili, appears to be 
      established through the induction of an innate immune response of the host. These
      results highlight the importance of B. bifidum as a microbial biomarker for UC,
      revealing its role in protection against experimentally induced colitis.

TI  - Presumed Allergic Proctocolitis Resolves with Probiotic Monotherapy: A Report of 
      4 Cases.
PG  - 621-4
AB  - BACKGROUND The prevalence of allergic diseases has been dramatically rising in
      the United States and other developed nations over recent decades. Growing
      evidence suggests a partial role for the microbiome in the development of these
      allergic diseases. Food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis (AP) (also
      referred to as cow's milk protein intolerance or allergy) is among the earliest
      and most common food allergic diseases of infancy, yet its pathophysiology is not
      well understood. The currently accepted clinical practice is to restrict the diet
      until 12 months of age. CASE REPORT We present 4 cases of clinically diagnosed AP
      whose symptoms quickly and completely resolved with probiotic Lactobacillus
      rhamnosus GG (LGG) monotherapy. All 4 infants avoided any dietary restrictions.
      The range of time from probiotic initiation to symptom resolution was 7-28 days. 
      CONCLUSIONS These cases suggest an important role for the infant intestinal
      microbiome in the development of gastrointestinal mucosal food allergies such as 
      AP. Prospective investigation of the intestinal microbiome in infants with AP may
      further our understanding of this disease's pathogenesis. The potential use of
      probiotic monotherapy in the treatment of AP also warrants further investigation.

TI  - Enterococcus durans TN-3 Induces Regulatory T Cells and Suppresses the
      Development of Dextran Sulfate Sodium (DSS)-Induced Experimental Colitis.
PG  - e0159705
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0159705 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Probiotic properties of Enterococcus strains have been
      reported previously. In this study, we investigated the effects of Enterococcus
      (E.) durans TN-3 on the development of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis.
      METHODS: BALB/c mice were fed with 4.0% DSS in normal chow. Administration of
      TN-3 (10mg/day) was initiated 7days before the start of DSS feeding. Mucosal
      cytokine expression was analyzed by real time-PCR and immunohistochemistry. The
      lymphocyte subpopulation were analyzed by flow cytometry. The gut microbiota
      profile was analyzed by a terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism
      method (T-RFLP). RESULTS: The disease activity index and histological colitis
      score were significantly lower in the DSS plus TN-3 group than in the DSS group. 
      The mucosal mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-17A 
      and IFN-gamma) decreased significantly in the DSS plus TN-3 group as compared to 
      the DSS group. The proportion of regulatory T cells (Treg cells) in the mucosa
      increased significantly in the DSS plus TN-3 group as compared to the DSS group. 
      Both fecal butyrate levels and the diversity of fecal microbial community were
      significantly higher in the TN-3 plus DSS group than in the DSS group.
      CONCLUSIONS: E. durans TN-3 exerted an inhibitory effect on the development of
      DSS colitis. This action might be mediated by the induction of Treg cells and the
      restoration of the diversity of the gut microbiota.

      probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri.
PG  - 802-818

AB  - Bacterial-derived compounds from the intestinal microbiome modulate host mucosal 
      immunity. Identification and mechanistic studies of these compounds provide
      insights into host-microbial mutualism. Specific Lactobacillus reuteri strains
      suppress production of the proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor (TNF),
      and are protective in a mouse model of colitis. Human-derived L. reuteri strain
      ATCC PTA 6475 suppresses intestinal inflammation and produces
      5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolic acid polyglutamates. Insertional mutagenesis
      identified the bifunctional dihydrofolate synthase/folylpolyglutamate synthase
      type 2 (folC2) gene as essential for 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolic acid
      polyglutamate biosynthesis, as well as for suppression of TNF production by
      activated human monocytes, and for the anti-inflammatory effect of L. reuteri
      6475 in a trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced mouse model of acute colitis. In 
      contrast, folC encodes the enzyme responsible for folate polyglutamylation but
      does not impact TNF suppression by L. reuteri. Comparative transcriptomics
      between wild-type and mutant L. reuteri strains revealed additional genes
      involved in immunomodulation, including previously identified hdc genes involved 
      in histidine to histamine conversion. The folC2 mutant yielded diminished hdc
      gene cluster expression and diminished histamine production, suggesting a link
      between folate and histadine/histamine metabolism. The identification of genes
      and gene networks regulating production of bacterial-derived immunoregulatory
      molecules may lead to improved anti-inflammatory strategies for digestive
      diseases.

TI  - Role and mechanisms of action of Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 in the maintenance 
      of remission in ulcerative colitis patients: An update.
PG  - 5505-11
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i24.5505 [doi]
AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease, whose etiology is
      still unclear. Its pathogenesis involves an interaction between genetic factors, 
      immune response and the "forgotten organ", Gut Microbiota. Several studies have
      been conducted to assess the role of antibiotics and probiotics as additional or 
      alternative therapies for Ulcerative Colitis. Escherichia coli Nissle (EcN) is a 
      nonpathogenic Gram-negative strain isolated in 1917 by Alfred Nissle and it is
      the active component of microbial drug Mutaflor((R)) (Ardeypharm GmbH, Herdecke, 
      Germany and EcN, Cadigroup, In Italy) used in many gastrointestinal disorder
      including diarrhea, uncomplicated diverticular disease and UC. It is the only
      probiotic recommended in ECCO guidelines as effective alternative to mesalazine
      in maintenance of remission in UC patients. In this review we propose an update
      on the role of EcN 1917 in maintenance of remission in UC patients, including
      data about efficacy and safety. Further studies may be helpful for this subject
      to further the full use of potential of EcN.

TI  - Lactobacillus curvatus WiKim38 isolated from kimchi induces IL-10 production in
      dendritic cells and alleviates DSS-induced colitis in mice.
PG  - 503-9
LID - 10.1007/s12275-016-6160-2 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria have healthpromoting effects
      by immune modulation. In the present study, we examined the immunomodulatory
      properties of Lactobacillus curvatus WiKim38, which was newly isolated from
      baechu (Chinese cabbage) kimchi. The ability of L. curvatus WiKim38 to induce
      cytokine production in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) was determined
      by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To evaluate the molecular mechanisms
      underlying L. curvatus Wikim38-mediated IL-10 production, Western blot analyses
      and inhibitor assays were performed. Moreover, the in vivo anti-inflammatory
      effects of L. curvatus WiKim38 were examined in a dextran sodium sulfate
      (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model. L. curvatus WiKim38 induced significantly
      higher levels of IL-10 in BMDCs compared with that induced by LPS. NF-kappaB and 
      ERK were activated by L. curvatus WiKim38, and an inhibitor assay revealed that
      these pathways were required for L. curvatus WiKim38-induced production of IL-10 
      in BMDCs. An in vivo experiment showed that oral administration of L. curvatus
      WiKim38 increased the survival rate of mice with DSS-induced colitis and improved
      clinical signs and histopathological severity in colon tissues. Taken together,
      these results indicate that L. curvatus Wikim38 may have health-promoting effects
      via immune modulation, and may thus be applicable for therapy of various
      inflammatory diseases.

AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the beneficial properties of a potentially probiotic yoghurt
      obtained by the fermentation of two selected anti-inflammatory bacterial strains 
      using in vivo mouse models of intestinal inflammation and colon carcinogenesis.
      METHODS AND RESULTS: Yoghurt was administered to mice suffering chemically
      induced intestinal inflammation or colon carcinogenesis. It was shown that this
      novel yoghurt was able to prevent local inflammation in the intestines of mice
      through a regulation of the immune response, prevent macroscopic and histological
      damages, and prevent colon carcinogenesis through an anti-inflammatory response. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The developed yoghurt showed in vivo anti-inflammatory properties by
      modulation of the host immune response for the prevention of colon inflammation
      and carcinogenesis. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This new yoghurt could 
      thus be considered a probiotic food and be useful as a complement to current
      treatment protocols for inflammatory bowel diseases and colon cancer, a first
      since there are no current functional foods specifically oriented for these
      patients.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis; Crohn's disease) are
      debilitating relapsing inflammatory disorders affecting the gastrointestinal
      tract, with deleterious effect on quality of life, and increasing incidence and
      prevalence. Mucosal inflammation, due to altered microbiota, increased intestinal
      permeability and immune system dysfunction underlies the symptoms and may be
      caused in susceptible individuals by different factors (or a combination of
      them), including dietary habits and components. In this review we describe the
      influence of the Western diet, obesity, and different nutraceuticals/functional
      foods (bioactive peptides, phytochemicals, omega 3-polyunsaturated fatty acids,
      vitamin D, probiotics and prebiotics) on the course of IBD, and provide some
      hints that could be useful for nutritional guidance. Hopefully, research will
      soon offer enough reliable data to slow down the spread of the disease and to
      make diet a cornerstone in IBD therapy.

TI  - Recent Advances and Understanding of Using Probiotic-Based Interventions to
      Restore Homeostasis of the Microbiome for the Prevention/Therapy of Bacterial
      Diseases.
LID - 10.1128/microbiolspec.VMBF-0025-2015 [doi]
AB  - The importance of the microbiome in health and disease has galvanized interest in
      using manipulations of the gastrointestinal ecosystem to prevent and/or combat
      gut bacterial infections and to restore mucosal homeostasis in patients with
      generalized microbial imbalances (i.e., dysbiosis), including the human
      inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. Probiotics,
      prebiotics, or their combination use (i.e., synbiotics) are one mechanism for
      modifying the microbiota and exerting direct and indirect effects on the host
      immune responses and metabolomics profiles. These beneficial effects are
      transferred through various pathways, including the production of antimicrobial
      peptides, promoting the growth of beneficial microbes and enhancing
      immunomodulatory functions via various metabolites. While probiotic therapy has
      been used empirically for decades with mixed success, the recent advances in
      molecular and mass spectrophotometric techniques for the characterization of the 
      complexity and diversity of the intestinal microbiome has aided in better
      understanding of host-microbe interactions. It is important to better understand 
      the functional properties of the microbiome, because it is now clear that the
      microbiota secretes many metabolites that have a direct impact on host immune
      responses. This information will improve selection of the most appropriate
      probiotic strains that selectively target intestinal disease processes.

AB  - Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are the 2 major phenotypes of inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD), which are influenced by a complex interplay of immunological
      and genetic elements, though the precise etiology still remains unknown. With IBD
      developing into a globally prevailing disease, there is a need to explore new
      targets and a thorough understanding of the pathophysiological differences
      between the healthy and diseased gut could unearth new therapeutic opportunities.
      In this review, we provide an overview of the major aspects of IBD pathogenesis
      and thereafter present a comprehensive analysis of the gut pathophysiology
      leading to a discussion on some of the most promising targets and biologic
      therapies currently being explored. These include various gut proteins (CXCL-10, 
      GATA-3, NKG2D, CD98, microRNAs), immune cells recruited to the gut (mast cells,
      eosinophils, toll-like receptors 2, 4), dysregulated proinflammatory cytokines
      (interleukin-6, -13, -18, -21), and commensal microbiota (probiotics and fecal
      microbiota transplantation). We also evaluate some of the emerging
      nonconventional therapies being explored in IBD treatment focusing on the latest 
      developments in stem cell research, oral targeting of the gut-associated lymphoid
      tissue, novel anti-inflammatory signaling pathway targeting, adenosine deaminase 
      inhibition, and the beneficial effects of antioxidant and nutraceutical
      therapies. In addition, we highlight the growth of biologics and their targets in
      IBD by providing information on the preclinical and clinical development of over 
      60 biopharmaceuticals representing the state of the art in ulcerative colitis and
      Crohn's disease drug development.

AB  - Diverticular disease is a common condition that is associated with variable
      presentations. For this review article, we performed a review of articles in
      PubMed through February 1, 2016, by using the following MeSH terms: colon
      diverticula, colonic diverticulitis, colonic diverticulosis, colonic
      diverticulum, colonic diverticula, and diverticula. Diverticula are structural
      alterations within the colonic wall that classically form "pockets" referred to
      as diverticula. Diverticula form from herniation of the colonic mucosa and
      submucosa through defects in the circular muscle layers within the colonic wall. 
      Often this is at the sites of penetrating blood vessels in the colon.
      Diverticular disease is extremely common, which resulted in 2,682,168 outpatient 
      visits and 283,355 hospitalization discharges for diverticulitis or
      diverticulosis in 2009. Diverticulosis is one of the most common detected
      conditions found incidentally on colonoscopy. Risk factors for the development of
      diverticulitis include obesity, smoking, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
      corticosteroids, and opiates. In contrast, fiber may be protective, but recent
      studies have questioned the role of fiber in developing diverticular disease.
      Most patients with diverticulosis will be asymptomatic, but a subset of patients 
      may develop nonspecific abdominal pain (isolated or recurrent), diverticulitis,
      or segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis. Classically, the treatment
      of diverticulitis has included antibiotics for all patients. More recent evidence
      indicates that in mild to even moderate uncomplicated diverticulitis, antibiotics
      may not be as necessary as initially believed. In more complicated
      diverticulitis, intravenous antibiotics and surgery may be necessary. Once a
      patient has had an attack of diverticulitis, increasing fiber may help prevent
      future attacks. Other modalities such as 5-aminosalicylate products, antibiotics,
      and probiotics are still of unclear benefit in preventing future episodes of
      diverticulitis. Similarly, even when patients develop recurrent episodes of
      diverticulitis, surgery may not be necessary as a prophylactic treatment.

TI  - Effect of probiotics (Lactobacillus plantarum 299 plus Bifidobacterium Cure21) in
      patients with poor ileal pouch function: a randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 1087-92
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2016.1161067 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Poor pouch function after restorative proctocolectomy for ulcerative
      colitis is a considerable problem. Pouchitis and functional disorders are the
      most common reasons. Probiotics seem to have a beneficial effect in pouchitis but
      have not been assessed in functional pouch disorders. The aim was to analyse the 
      effects of probiotics in patients with poor pouch function. METHODS: Thirty-three
      patients were randomized to probiotics (Lactobacillus plantarum 299 and
      Bifidobacterium infantis Cure 21) or placebo in a double blinded, 1:1 fashion.
      The treatment effect was assessed by the pouch functional score (PFS; 0-15, 15
      worst), pouchitis disease activity index (PDAI; 0-18, 18 worst), and levels of
      four faecal biomarkers of inflammation (calprotectin, lactoferrin,
      myeloperoxidase [MPO] and eosinophilic cationic protein [ECP]). RESULTS:
      Thirty-two patients were included (probiotics = 17, placebo = 16). There was no
      difference in change in the PFS from before to after treatment between the groups
      (median difference: -1.00, 95% C.I. -3.00 to 0.00, p = 0.119). Furthermore,
      probiotics had no effect on PDAI (median difference: 0.00, 95% C.I. 0.00-1.00, p 
      = 0.786), or on faecal biomarkers. Significant correlations were observed between
      PDAI and each of the faecal biomarkers at study start. There were no correlations
      between PFS or PDAI symptom subscore and the biomarkers. PDAI endoscopic and
      histologic subscores correlated significantly to each of the biomarkers.
      CONCLUSION: The hypothesis that probiotics improves pouch-related dysfunction was
      not confirmed. Faecal biomarkers could play a future role in the management of
      pouch patients.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of inflammatory disorders of the
      intestine caused by dysregulated T-cell mediated immune response against
      commensal microflora. Probiotics are reported as therapeutically effective
      against IBD. However, variable efficacy of the live probiotic strains, difference
      in survival and persistence in the gut between the strains and the lack of
      insight into the mechanisms of probiotic action limit optimal therapeutic
      efficacy. Our aims were to evaluate the lactobacillus strains isolated from the
      North Indian population for the generation of regulatory cells and cytokines in
      the intestine, to study their effects on pro-inflammatory mediators in the mouse 
      model of inflammatory bowel disease and to explore the underlying mechanisms of
      their actions. Among the selected lactobacillus strains, Lactobacillus casei Lbs2
      (MTCC5953) significantly suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced pro-inflammatory
      cytokine (TNF-alpha, IL-6) secretion. Both live and heat-killed Lbs2 polarized
      Th0 cells to T-regulatory (Treg) cells in vitro, increased the frequency of
      FoxP3(+) Treg cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) and alleviated
      macroscopic and histopathological features of colitis in probiotic-fed mice.
      Moreover, the levels of IL-12, TNF-alpha and IL-17A were suppressed, while IL-10 
      and TGF-beta levels were augmented in the colonic tissues of Lbs2-treated mice.
      The induced Treg (iTreg) cells secreted IL-10 and TGF-beta and exerted
      suppressive effects on the proliferation of effector T-cells. Adoptive transfer
      of iTreg cells ameliorated the disease manifestations of murine colitis and
      suppressed the levels of TNF-alpha and IL-17A. Finally, Lbs2 effects were
      mediated by Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) activation on the dendritic cells. This
      study identified live and heat-killed Lbs2 as putative therapeutic candidates
      against IBD and highlighted their Toll-like receptor 2-dependent immunomodulatory
      and regulatory function.

AB  - Development of the intestinal microbiota during early life serves as a key
      regulatory stage in establishing the host-microbial relationship. This symbiotic 
      relationship contributes to developing host immunity and maintaining health
      throughout the life span. This study was to develop an approach to colonize
      conventionally raised mice with a model probiotic bacterium, Lactobacillus
      rhamnosus GG (LGG), and to determine the effects of LGG colonization on
      intestinal development and prevention of colitis in adulthood. LGG colonization
      in conventionally raised was established by administering LGG to pregnant mice
      starting at gestational day 18 and pups at postnatal days 1- 5. LGG colonization 
      promoted bodyweight gain and increased diversity and richness of the colonic
      mucosa-associated microbiota before weaning. Intestinal epithelial cell
      proliferation, differentiation, tight junction formation, and mucosal IgA
      production were all significantly enhanced in LGG-colonized mice. Adult mice
      colonized with LGG showed increased IgA production and decreased susceptibility
      to intestinal injury and inflammation induced in the dextran sodium sulfate model
      of colitis. Thus, neonatal colonization of mice with LGG enhances intestinal
      functional maturation and IgA production and confers lifelong health consequences
      on protection from intestinal injury and inflammation. This strategy might be
      applied for benefiting health in the host.

AB  - Following restorative proctocolectomy with an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, the
      small bowel mucosa undergoes several specific histologic adaptions, which may be 
      unrelated to the underlying disease or symptoms of pouchitis. An increase in
      intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) has not been described as part of this
      spectrum. Mucosal biopsies of the ileal pouch and afferent limb of 230 patients
      (mean age: 45.7y [18.3-74.7], gender [female/male]: 117/113) with a functioning
      ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (mean time since ileostomy closure: 10.8months) and 
      associated clinically annotated outcome data were assessed for IELs/100
      enterocytes. Forty-two patients (18.3%) showed an increase in IELs (>/=20
      IELs/100 enterocytes [range 20-39]), in pouch and/or afferent limb biopsies.
      Intraepithelial lymphocytosis was more commonly observed in afferent limb
      compared to pouch biopsies (18.8% vs 8.3%; P = .42) and in familial adenomatous
      polyposis compared to ulcerative colitis patients (16% vs 8%; P = 0.36), but
      neither difference reached statistical significance. No cases with increased IELs
      displayed severe villous blunting. Increased IELs were not significantly
      associated with age, sex, ethnicity, smoking history, time since ileostomy, use
      of antibiotics, biologic agents, anti-diarrheal agents or probiotics, C-reactive 
      protein levels or differential white cell count. None of the 42 patients with
      increased IELs had positive celiac serology (anti-human tissue transglutaminase
      IgA [ELISA] with corresponding total serum IgA). Intraepithelial lymphocytosis in
      pouch biopsies may represent a subclinical response to an altered bacterial
      microenvironment. Pathologists should be aware that intraepithelial lymphocytosis
      is part of the spectrum of changes in pouch biopsies, and only rarely is due to
      celiac disease.

PG  - 129-33

AB  - Patients with inflammatory bowel disease often have extraintestinal
      manifestations (EIMs) involving almost all organ systems, but little has been
      reported on Achilles tendinitis. Herein, we present a unique case of Achilles
      tendinitis, which manifested shortly after initiation of mesalazine therapy for
      ulcerative colitis. A 26-year-old Japanese woman with bloody diarrhea and
      abdominal cramps lasting for 7 days was referred to our hospital. The Lichtiger
      clinical activity index (CAI) score was 9 at the first visit. Based on the
      clinical symptoms and examination results, she was diagnosed with ulcerative
      pancolitis in the active phase, and treatment with mesalazine (2.4 g/day) and
      probiotics was initiated. Her symptoms resolved within 7 days of treatment (CAI
      3). However, she then developed bilateral Achilles tendinitis without any
      apparent cause. The Achilles tendinitis subsided with conservative management
      within 2 weeks, despite continuation of mesalazine therapy. This case
      instructively suggests that Achilles tendinitis should be noted as an EIM of
      ulcerative colitis.

AB  - Clostridium difficile is an anaerobic, gram positive, sporulating,
      toxin-producing bacillus which causes a spectrum of clinical disease ranging from
      an asymptomatic carrier state to toxic megacolon and fulminant disease. Infection
      with C. difficile is an expensive and pervasive health care burden. The current
      theory regarding the development of C. difficile infection (CDI) suggests that
      disruption of the structure and/or function of an individual's normal intestinal 
      microbiota enables colonization by C. difficile, and in the absence of an
      effective immune response, the bacteria causes illness. In this article we
      discuss the role of the colonic microbiota in the development of CDI and the
      potential role of probiotics in preventing and treating CDI. We review the
      evidence from in vitro laboratory and pre-clinical studies, as well as evidence
      from clinical studies and discuss the current recommendations for the use of
      probiotics for CDI in clinical practice.

AB  - Therapeutic manipulation of gut microbiota has proven valuable in the management 
      of ulcerative colitis and pouchitis. Despite some similarities among the various 
      inflammatory bowel conditions, the probiotics investigated thus far seem to
      confer little benefit in Crohn's disease. In this review, we aim to bring
      together the evidence available on the clinical effect of probiotics and
      prebioltics in Crohn's disease patients, and to clarify the place of probiotic
      treatment in current Crohn's therapeutic regimens.

AB  - The intestinal microbiota is one of the key players in the etiology of ulcerative
      colitis. Manipulation of this microflora with probiotics and prebiotics is an
      attractive strategy in the management of ulcerative colitis. Several intervention
      studies for both the induction and maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis
      patients have been performed. Most of these studies evaluated VSL#3 or E. Coli
      Nissle 1917 and in general there is evidence for efficacy of these agents for
      induction and maintenance of remission. However, studies are frequently
      underpowered, lack a control group, and are very heterogeneous investigating
      different probiotic strains in different study populations. The absence of
      well-powered robust randomized placebo-controlled trials impedes the widespread
      use of probiotics and prebiotics in ulcerative colitis. However, given the
      promising results that are currently available, probiotics and prebiotics may
      find their way to the treatment algorithm for ulcerative colitis in the near
      future.

TI  - [Recent epidemiology of Clostridium difficile infection in Japan].
PG  - 345-58
AB  - Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a major pathogen for diarrhea in
      hospitalized patients and because of outbreak of highly virulent strain in EU and
      US, increased length of hospital stay and increased numbers of severe patients
      and deaths have become major challenges. In recent years, transmissions through
      community-acquired or food-borne infections are reported. National surveillance
      has been already performed overseas. Guidelines for preventing C. difficile
      infection (CDI) is available, and education activities are promoted for
      preventing the infection spread. Meanwhile, in Japan, medical hospitals are
      reporting individual CDI incidence, however, a large-scale research has not been 
      conducted up to the present date and therefore the entire status of CDI including
      infection of the highly virulent strain has yet to be revealed. This time, we
      performed a questionnaire-based survey at 2,537 hospitals nationwide between
      April 15, 2013 and May 31, 2013 to investigate CDI incidence, diagnosis and
      treatment. Valid responses were obtained from 321 hospitals. Regarding the annual
      number of CDI patients at all the hospitals, the highest group of hospitals
      responding "1 to 5 patients a year" was 17.8%, and the second highest group of
      hospitals responding "no patients a year" was 13.1%. In contrast, there was a
      group of hospitals with "more than 101 patients a year", which was 3.1%. This
      indicates that there was the difference in the CDI incidences among hospitals.
      According to the questionnaire results, a highest group of hospitals responding
      "0-20%" for CDI patients with serious complication such as toxic megacolon,
      gastrointestinal perforation, ileus paralytic, bacteremia, sepsis, crohn's
      disease, and ulcerative colitis was 62.6%, and for CDI patients with recurrence
      more than one, a group of hospitals answering "0 to 20%" was 56.4%, which was the
      highest. This suggested that there was only a small number of serious CDI
      patients and recurrence CDI patients in Japan. For rapid toxin detection kit used
      in CDI diagnosis, a group of hospitals using "C. DIFF QUIK CHEK COMPLETE" was
      over 40%, which showed that the kit was a major product used in Japan. And a
      group of institutions responding that they will start antibacterial medication
      such as vancomycin (VCM) and metronidazole (MNZ) as soon as after rapid
      diagnostic test, etc. showing positive results was over 70%. As for CDI
      treatment, a highest group of hospitals answering that VCM is administered orally
      at a dose of "0.5 g four times daily" was 42.1%, and a group of hospitals
      responding "10 to 14 days" for administration period was 44.2%, which was the
      highest. A highest group of hospitals answering that MNZ is administered orally
      at a dose of "250 mg four times daily" was 38.3%, and a group of hospitals
      responding "10 to 14 days" for administration period was 46.4%, which was the
      highest. Apart from VCM and MNZ, probiotics are also used for CDI treatment,
      "butyric acid bacterium" accounted for 40.8% in the probiotics group, which was
      the highest, followed by "bifidobacteria" 37.7% and "resistant lactic acid
      bacterium" 25.6%. To prevent the spread of CDI, 47.7% of the hospitals responded 
      that the patients are "isolated", while 25.6% answered the patients are
      "sometimes isolated", which means that more than 70% of patients are "isolated or
      sometimes isolated". As to what type of antiseptic drug is used for sterilizing
      hospital, 68.2% of the hospitals answered that they are using "sodium
      hypochlorite 1,000 ppm". The survey more than 300 hospitals have revealed not
      only the CDI incidences, timing of toxin test, and part of the actual therapeutic
      strategy at medical institutions in Japan but also the difference in the CDI
      incidences and therapeutic strategy among hospitals. In the future,
      epidemiological data on epidemic strain will be accumulated more in Japan as are 
      done overseas, and guidelines for CDI diagnosis and treatment will need to be
      formulated.

TI  - Characterisation and therapeutic manipulation of the gut microbiome in
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 266-73
LID - 10.1111/imj.13003 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases are thought to develop as a result of dysregulation
      of the relationship that exists between the gut microbiota, host genetics and the
      immune system. The advent of culture-independent techniques has revolutionised
      the ability to characterise the role of the gut microbiota in health and disease 
      based on the microbiota's genetic make-up. Inflammatory bowel diseases are
      characterised by dysbiosis which is an imbalance between pro- and
      anti-inflammatory bacteria and a reduction in bacterial diversity. Emerging data 
      suggest that it is not only the presence of the gut microbiota but the functional
      activity of the microbiota that appears to play an important role in health and
      disease. Current strategies to manipulate therapeutically the gut microbiota
      using dietary modification, prebiotics, probiotics, antibiotics and faecal
      microbiota transplantation aim to restore the balance to a state of normobiosis. 
      However, the ability of such strategies to correct dysbiosis and thereby achieve 
      therapeutic benefit is yet to be fully characterised.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There are some evidences for the immunomodulation disorders in the
      response to intestinal microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease. Yogurt is a
      fermented milk product made with a starter culture consisting of different
      probiotics which could be colonized in intestine. However, the role of probiotics
      in the aetiopathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC) has not been clarified. To
      determine how the immune system responds to these bacteria this study was
      planned. METHODS: Bifidobacterium lactis BB-12 (B. lactis) and Lactobacillus
      acidophilus LA-5 (L. acidophilus) were cultivated on MRS broth. PBMCs of 36 UC
      patients were separated by Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation and co-cultured with
      different concentrations of UV killed bacteria in RPMI-1 640 plus 10% FCS for
      48/72 h. IL-10, TGF-beta, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha were measured in supernatant of
      PBMCs by ELISA. RESULTS: Both bacteria significantly augmented IL-10, TGF-beta,
      IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha compared to control (p<0.001). The secretion levels of
      IL-10 and TGF-beta by B. lactis- compared to L. acidophilus-stimulated PBMCs were
      significantly higher (p<0.05, p<0.01 respectively). The secretion levels of
      TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma by PBMCs after 72 h were significantly lower compared to 
      48 h stimulation by B. lactis (p<0.001, p<0.035 respectively). CONCLUSION: These 
      data show that both probiotics may trigger the pro- and anti-inflammatory immune 
      response of UC patients. It seems that IL-10/TGF-beta uprising by B. lactis could
      be the reason of TNF-alpha/IFN-gamma reduction. Therefore albeit B. lactis still 
      stimulates the effector Th cells but because of more stimulatory effect on Tregs,
      it could be a good potential therapeutic candidate for further investigation.

TI  - Diet therapy for inflammatory bowel diseases: The established and the new.
PG  - 2179-94
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i7.2179 [doi]
AB  - Although patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have a strong interest
      in dietary modifications as part of their therapeutic management, dietary advice 
      plays only a minor part in published guidelines. The scientific literature shows 
      that dietary factors might influence the risk of developing IBD, that dysbiosis
      induced by nutrition contributes to the pathogenesis of IBD, and that diet may
      serve as a symptomatic treatment for irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms in
      IBD. The role of nutrition in IBD is underscored by the effect of various dietary
      therapies. In paediatric patients with Crohn's disease (CD) enteral nutrition
      (EN) reaches remission rates similar to steroids. In adult patients, however, EN 
      is inferior to corticosteroids. EN is not effective in ulcerative colitis (UC).
      Total parenteral nutrition in IBD is not superior to steroids or EN. The use of
      specific probiotics in patients with IBD can be recommended only in special
      clinical situations. There is no evidence for efficacy of probiotics in CD. By
      contrast, studies in UC have shown a beneficial effect in selected patients. For 
      patients with pouchitis, antibiotic treatment followed by probiotics, like VSL#3 
      or Lactobacillus GG, is effective. When probiotics are used, the risk of
      bacterial translocation and subsequent bacteremia has to be considered. More
      understanding of the normal intestinal microflora, and better characterization of
      probiotic strains at the phenotypic and genomic levels is needed as well as
      clarification of the mechanisms of action in different clinical settings. A
      FODMAP reduced diet may improve symptoms in IBD.

TI  - Human oral isolate Lactobacillus fermentum AGR1487 induces a pro-inflammatory
      response in germ-free rat colons.
PG  - 20318
LID - 10.1038/srep20318 [doi]
AB  - Lactobacilli are thought to be beneficial for human health, with
      lactobacilli-associated infections being confined to immune-compromised
      individuals. However, Lactobacillus fermentum AGR1487 negatively affects barrier 
      integrity in vitro so we hypothesized that it caused a pro-inflammatory response 
      in the host. We compared germ-free rats inoculated with AGR1487 to those
      inoculated with another L. fermentum strain, AGR1485, which does not affect in
      vitro barrier integrity. We showed that rats inoculated with AGR1487 had more
      inflammatory cells in their colon, higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers, and 
      increased colonic gene expression of pro-inflammatory pathways. In addition, our 
      in vitro studies showed that AGR1487 had a greater capacity to activate TLR
      signaling and induce pro-inflammatory cytokines in immune cells. This study
      indicates the potential of strains of the same species to differentially elicit
      inflammatory responses in the host and highlights the importance of strain
      characterization in probiotic approaches to treat inflammatory disorders.

TI  - Different Effects of Three Selected Lactobacillus Strains in Dextran Sulfate
      Sodium-Induced Colitis in BALB/c Mice.
PG  - e0148241
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0148241 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To analyze the changes of different Lactobacillus species in ulcerative
      colitis patients and to further assess the therapeutic effects of selected
      Lactobacillus strains on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced experimental
      colitis in BALB/c mice. METHODS: Forty-five active ulcerative colitis (UC)
      patients and 45 population-based healthy controls were enrolled. Polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) amplification and real-time PCR were performed for qualitative and
      quantitative analyses, respectively, of the Lactobacillus species in UC patients.
      Three Lactobacillus strains from three species were selected to assess the
      therapeutic effects on experimental colitis. Sixty 8-week-old BALB/c mice were
      divided into six groups. The five groups that had received DSS were administered 
      normal saline, mesalazine, L. fermentum CCTCC M206110 strain, L. crispatus CCTCC 
      M206119 strain, or L. plantarum NCIMB8826 strain. We assessed the severity of
      colitis based on disease activity index (DAI), body weight loss, colon length,
      and histologic damage. RESULTS: The detection rate of four of the 11
      Lactobacillus species decreased significantly (P < 0.05), and the detection rate 
      of two of the 11 Lactobacillus species increased significantly (P < 0.05) in UC
      patients. Relative quantitative analysis revealed that eight Lactobacillus
      species declined significantly in UC patients (P < 0.05), while three
      Lactobacillus species increased significantly (P < 0.05). The CCTCC M206110
      treatment group had less weight loss and colon length shortening, lower DAI
      scores, and lower histologic scores (P < 0.05), while the CCTCC M206119 treatment
      group had greater weight loss and colon length shortening, higher histologic
      scores, and more severe inflammatory infiltration (P < 0.05). NCIMB8826 improved 
      weight loss and colon length shortening (P < 0.05) with no significant influence 
      on DAI and histologic damage in the colitis model. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of
      an L. crispatus CCTCC M206119 supplement aggravated DSS-induced colitis. L.
      fermentum CCTCC M206110 proved to be effective at attenuating DSS-induced
      colitis. The potential probiotic effect of L. plantarum NCIMB8826 on UC has yet
      to be assessed.

TI  - Therapeutic Potential to Modify the Mucus Barrier in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
LID - 10.3390/nu8010044 [doi]
LID - E44 [pii]
AB  - Recently, numerous studies have shown that disruption of the mucus barrier plays 
      an important role in the exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease, particularly
      in ulcerative colitis. Alterations in the mucus barrier are well supported by
      published data and are widely accepted. The use of fluorescence in situ
      hybridization and Carnoy's fixation has revealed the importance of the mucus
      barrier in maintaining a mutualistic relationship between host and bacteria.
      Studies have raised the possibility that modulation of the mucus barrier may
      provide therapies for the disease, using agents such as short-chain fatty acids, 
      prebiotics and probiotics. This review describes changes in the mucus barrier of 
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease and in animal models of the disease. We 
      also review the involvement of the mucus barrier in the exacerbation of the
      disease and explore the therapeutic potential of modifying the mucus barrier with
      short-chain fatty acids, prebiotics, probiotics, fatty acid synthase, H(2)S,
      neutrophil elastase inhibitor and phophatidyl choline.

TI  - Faecalibacterium prausnitzii A2-165 has a high capacity to induce IL-10 in human 
      and murine dendritic cells and modulates T cell responses.

AB  - Faecalibacterium prausnitzii strain A2-165 was previously reported to have
      anti-inflammatory properties and prevent colitis in a TNBS model. We compared the
      immunomodulatory properties of strain A2-165 to four different F. prausnitzii
      isolates and eight abundant intestinal commensals using human dendritic cells
      (DCs) and mouse BMDCs in vitro. Principal component analysis revealed that the
      cytokine response to F. prausnitzii A2-165 is distinct from the other strains in 
      eliciting high amounts of IL-10 secretion. The mouse DNBS model of relapsing IBD 
      was used to compare the protective effects of F. prausnitzii A2-165 and
      Clostridium hathewayi, a low secretor of IL-10, on the Th1-driven inflammatory
      response to DNBS; attenuation of disease parameters was only observed with F.
      prausnitzii. In an in vivo mouse model of nasal tolerance to ovalbumin, F.
      prausnitzii A2-165 enhanced ovalbumin-specific T cell proliferation and reduced
      the proportion of IFN-gamma(+) T cells in CLNs. Similarly, in vitro F.
      prausnitzii A2-165 stimulated BMDCs increased ovalbumin-specific T cell
      proliferation and reduced the number of IFN-gamma(+) T cells. These mechanisms
      may contribute to the anti-inflammatory effects of F. prausnitzii in colitis and 
      support the notion that this abundant bacterium might contribute to immune
      homeostasis in the intestine via its anti-inflammatory properties.

TI  - Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 in Ulcerative Colitis Treatment: Systematic Review
      and Meta-analysis.
PG  - 499-505
LID - 10.15403/jgld.2014.1121.244.ecn [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) has been recommended as a
      therapeutic tool for ulcerative colitis (UC) treatment. However, to date, no
      meta-analysis has been performed on this topic. METHODS: We performed a
      literature search on PubMed, MEDLINE, Science Direct and EMBASE. We evaluated
      success rates for induction of remission, relapse rates and side effects,
      expressed as Intention-To-Treat. Odd ratios (OR), pooled OR and 95% confidence
      intervals (CI) were calculated, based on the Mantel-Haenszel method.
      Heterogeneity was assessed by using the chi2 and I2 statistics and, if present, a
      random-effects model was adopted. RESULTS: We selected six eligible trials, with 
      719 patients, 390 assigned to the study group and 329 to the control group. EcN
      induced remission in 61.6% of cases, while in the control group (mesalazine) the 
      remission was achieved in 69.5% of cases, with a mean difference of 7.9%. The
      pooled OR was 0.92 (95% CI 0.15-9.66, p=0.93). A single study showed a better
      performance of EcN than the placebo. A relapse of the disease occurred in 36.8%
      in the EcN group and in 36.1% in the control group (mesalazine), with a mean
      difference of 0.8%, OR=1.07, with a 95% CI of 0.70-1.64 (p=0.74). Side effects
      were comparable (OR=1.44, 95% CI 0.80-2.59, p=0.22). CONCLUSIONS: EcN is
      equivalent to mesalazine in preventing disease relapse, thus confirming current
      guideline recommendations. EcN seems to be as effective as controls in inducing
      remission and therefore, its use cannot be recommended as in one study the
      comparison was performed against placebo. Further studies may be helpful for this
      subject.

TI  - Lactobacillus plantarum NCIMB8826 ameliorates inflammation of colon and skin in
      human APOC1 transgenic mice.
PG  - 215-25
LID - 10.3920/BM2015.0074 [doi]
AB  - Genetic predisposition and environmental factors, including the gut microbiota,
      have been suggested as major factors in the development and progression of atopic
      dermatitis. Hyperlipidemic human APOC1(+/+) transgenic mice display many features
      of human atopic dermatitis, such as scaling, lichenification, excoriations, and
      pruritus, along with a disturbed skin barrier function. Cytokine analysis of
      serum shows an increase of various pro-inflammatory cytokines, including
      interleukin (IL)-12p40, IL-6, and IL-1alpha, but lower levels of
      interferon-gamma. These mice also display aspects of colitis evident from
      macroscopic and histological abnormalities. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis of
      the intestine shows up-regulation of several genes associated with mast cells and
      eosinophils and this observation was confirmed by demonstrating increased numbers
      of IgE(+) and FcRepsilon(+) mast cells in the colon and in the skin. Oral
      treatment with Lactobacillus plantarum NCIMB8826 resulted in decreased numbers of
      mast cells in the colon. Moreover, this L. plantarum strain ameliorated skin
      pathology, evident from improved skin barrier integrity, absence of skin
      thickening, and less excoriations. These results suggest that modulation of
      intestinal immune homeostasis contributes to the suppression of atopic
      dermatitis.

TI  - Probiotics in digestive diseases: focus on Lactobacillus GG.
PG  - 273-92
AB  - Probiotics are becoming increasingly important in basic and clinical research,
      but they are also a subject of considerable economic interest due to their
      expanding popularity. They are live micro-organisms which, when administered in
      adequate amounts, confer a health benefit to the host. From this very well-known 
      definition, it is clear that, unlike drugs, probiotics might be useful in healthy
      subjects to reduce the risk of developing certain diseases or to optimise some
      physiological functions. They also may offer some advantages in already ill
      persons in relieving symptoms and signs, e.g. people with acute diarrhea.
      According to current definitions, probiotics should survive both gastric acid and
      bile to reach the small intestine and colon, where they exert their effects. Many
      of these are available in a lyophilized (freeze-dried) pill form, though some are
      available in yogurt or as packets (sachets), which can be mixed into
      non-carbonated drinks. The present review focuses on three main issues: 1)
      understanding why, at present, probiotics are so interesting for doctors and
      consumers; 2) reviewing the available data on probiotic use in digestive
      diseases, in particular irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), (prevention of)
      infectious diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), non-alcoholic fatty liver 
      disease (NAFLD), and colorectal cancer (CRC); 3) highlighting the individual
      profile of Lactobacillus GG (LGG) in the above contexts, providing an assessment 
      as well as recommendations on its use in gastro-intestinal tract (GIT) disorders.
      Research studies conducted in animals and humans with the main probiotics strains
      for GIT diseases, and published from the early 1990s to 2014 have been
      considered. PubMed, Medline and Ovid were the main sources adopted for data
      retrieving. The increasing attention on probiotics is a direct consequence of the
      improvement in the techniques for studying microbiota. Until recently, its
      composition has been analysed by culture-based methods that use differential
      media to select for specific populations of bacteria according to their metabolic
      requirements. Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species are by and large the most
      commonly used probiotics. Strictly speaking, however, the term "probiotic" should
      be reserved for live microbes that have been shown in controlled human studies to
      provide a health benefit. Taking into account patients suffering from the most
      common gastrointestinal diseases, in whose establishment the GI microbiota plays 
      a key role, probiotics have to be considered as very promising agents, capable of
      beneficially modulating the intestinal ecosystem, which is perturbed in cases of 
      dysbiosis. Although more clinical data are still needed to better assess the
      clinical relevance of probiotics, to date, procariota such as Bifidobacteria and 
      Lactobacilli strains, and eucariota such as some Saccharomyces strains are among 
      the most widely used agents in GIT disorders. LGG is a well-known probiotic
      strain that was isolated more than 20 years ago by Goldin and Gorbach from a
      faecal sample of a healthy adult, based on several selection criteria: high
      adhesion in vitro, high resistance against gastric acidity and high antimicrobial
      activity against pathogens such as Salmonella. In vivo studies have also shown a 
      good persistence of LGG in the human GIT. Since its isolation, LGG has become one
      of the best clinically documented probiotic strains. A growing body of evidence
      suggests benefits such as prevention and relief of various types of diarrhoea,
      and treatment of relapsing Clostridium difficile colitis. Thus, with respect to
      both adaptation to the GIT and probiotic effects, LGG can be regarded as a
      prototypical probiotic strain.

      remission and relapse in murine chronic colitis.
PG  - 205-13
LID - 10.3920/bm2015.0037 [doi]
AB  - Although interest in using probiotics to prevent and treat intestinal diseases is
      increasing, the effects of specific probiotic strains still remain unclear. Here,
      we assess the therapeutic effects of two probiotic strains, Lactobacillus
      rhamnosus NutRes 1 and Bifidobacterium breve NutRes 204 on a dextran sodium
      sulphate (DSS)-induced chronic murine colitis model. The chronic colitis was
      induced by two DSS treatment cycles with a rest period of 10 days (the remission 
      or resolution phase). The probiotic supplementation was started during the
      resolution phase, after the first DSS treatment cycle, and continued until the
      end of the experiment. In addition to clinical observations made during the
      experiment, cellular infiltration was measured along with mRNA expression of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, T cell-associated cytokines, and Toll like receptors 
      (TLR) in the inflamed colon after second DSS treatment cycle. L. rhamnosus, but
      not B. breve, rapidly and effectively improved the DSS-induced bloody diarrhoea
      during the resolution phase. However, a contradictory effect by both probiotic
      strains on the faecal condition was found after re-induction of colitis. The
      worsening of the faecal condition was accompanied by a reduced number of
      neutrophils and increased expression of interferon-gamma in the colons of
      DSS-treated mice. Furthermore, an increased expression of TLR2, TLR6 and
      pro-inflammatory markers including chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2, interleukin
      (IL)-1beta, tumour necrosis factor alpha and IL-6 was found in DSS-treated mice
      with L. rhamnosus supplementation. These results indicate that therapeutic
      administration of specific probiotics might be beneficial during the resolution
      phase of colitis. However, caution should be taken as specific probiotic
      treatments reduce neutrophil influx, which may be the reason of exacerbation of
      chronic colitis.

TI  - Highly Heterogeneous Probiotic Lactobacillus Species in Healthy Iranians with Low
      Functional Activities.
PG  - e0144467
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0144467 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have been considered as potentially
      probiotic organisms due to their potential human health properties. This study
      aimed to evaluate both in vitro and in vivo, the potential probiotic properties
      of Lactobacillus species isolated from fecal samples of healthy humans in Iran.
      METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 470 LAB were initially isolated from 53 healthy
      individual and characterized to species level. Of these, 88 (86%) were
      Lactobacillus species. Biochemical and genetic fingerprinting with Phene-Plate
      system (PhP-LB) and RAPD-PCR showed that the isolates were highly diverse
      consisted of 67(76.1%) and 75 (85.2%) single types (STs) and a diversity indices 
      of 0.994 and 0.997, respectively. These strains were tested for production of
      adhesion to Caco-2 cells, antibacterial activity, production of B12,
      anti-proliferative effect and interleukin-8 induction on gut epithelial cell
      lines and antibiotic resistance against 9 commonly used antibiotics. Strains
      showing the characteristics consistent with probiotic strains, were further
      tested for their anti-inflammatory effect in mouse colitis model. Only one L.
      brevis; one L. rhamnosus and two L. plantarum were shown to have significant
      probiotic properties. These strains showed shortening the length of colon
      compared to dextran sulfate sodium and disease activity index (DAI) was also
      significantly reduced in mouse. CONCLUSION: Low number of LAB with potential
      probiotic activity as well as high diversity of lactobacilli species was evident 
      in Iranian population. It also suggest that specific strains of L. plantarum, L. 
      brevis and L. rhamnosus with anti-inflammatory effect in mouse model of colitis
      could be used as a potential probiotic candidate in inflammatory bowel disease to
      decrease the disease activity index.

AB  - Clostridium difficile is being recognized as a growing threat to many health-care
      systems. Epidemiology data shows that infection rates are soaring and the disease
      burden is increasing. Despite the efficacy of standard treatments, it is becoming
      evident that novel therapeutics will be required to tackle this disease. These
      new treatments aim to enhance the intestinal microbial barrier, activate the
      immune system and neutralize the toxins that mediate this disease. Many of these 
      therapies are still in the beginning stages of investigation, however, in the
      next few years, more clinical data will become available to help implement many
      of these exciting new therapeutic approaches.

AB  - Dairy propionibacteria (PAB) are used as a ripening starter in combination with
      Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) for dairy products such as Swiss-type cheese. LAB and 
      PAB have also been studied for their probiotic properties but little is still
      known about their individual and/or synergistic beneficial effects within dairy
      matrices. In the context of a rising incidence of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, it
      has become crucial to evaluate the immunomodulatory potential of bacteria
      ingested in large numbers via dairy products. We therefore selected different
      strains and combinations of technological LAB and PAB. We determined their
      immunomodulatory potential by IL-10 and IL-12 induction, in human peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells, on either single or mixed cultures, grown on laboratory 
      medium or directly in milk. Milk was fermented with selected anti-inflammatory
      strains of LAB or PAB/LAB mixed cultures and the resulting bacterial fractions
      were also evaluated for these properties, together with starter viability and
      optimum technological aspects. The most promising fermented milks were evaluated 
      in the context of TNBS- or DSS-induced colitis in mice. The improvement in
      inflammatory parameters evidenced an alleviation of colitis symptoms as a result 
      of fermented milk consumption. This effect was clearly strain-dependent and
      modulated by growth within a fermented dairy product. These findings offer new
      tools and perspectives for the development of immunomodulatory fermented dairy
      products for targeted populations.

TI  - Treatment and prevention of pouchitis after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for
      chronic ulcerative colitis.
PG  - CD001176
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD001176.pub3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pouchitis occurs in approximately 50% of patients following ileal
      pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) for chronic ulcerative colitis. OBJECTIVES: The
      primary objective was to determine the efficacy and safety of medical therapies
      (including antibiotics, probiotics, and other agents) for prevention or treatment
      of acute or chronic pouchitis. SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and
      the Cochrane Library from inception to October 2014. SELECTION CRITERIA:
      Randomized controlled trials of prevention or treatment of acute or chronic
      pouchitis in adults who underwent IPAA for ulcerative colitis were considered for
      inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently screened
      studies for eligibility, extracted data and assessed study quality.
      Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The
      overall quality of the evidence supporting the outcomes was evaluated using the
      GRADE criteria. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with clinical 
      improvement or remission of pouchitis in patients with acute or chronic
      pouchitis, or the proportion of patients with no episodes of pouchitis after
      IPAA. The proportion of patients who developed at least one adverse event was a
      secondary outcome. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95%
      confidence interval (CI) for each dichotomous outcome. MAIN RESULTS: Thirteen
      studies (517 participants) were included in the review. Four studies assessed
      treatment of acute pouchitis. One study (16 participants) compared ciprofloxacin 
      and metronidazole; another (26 participants) compared metronidazole to budesonide
      enemas; another (18 participants) compared rifaximin to placebo; and the fourth
      study (20 participants) compared Lactobacillus GG to placebo. Four studies
      assessed treatment of chronic pouchitis. One study (19 participants) compared
      glutamine to butyrate suppositories; another (40 participants) compared bismuth
      enemas to placebo; and two studies (76 participants) compared VSL#3 to placebo.
      Five studies assessed prevention of pouchitis. One study (40 participants)
      compared VSL#3 to placebo; another (28 participants) compared VLS#3 to no
      treatment; one study (184 participants) compared allopurinol to placebo; another 
      (12 participants) compared the probiotic Bifidobacterium longum to placebo; and
      one study (38 participants) compared tinidazole to placebo. Three studies were
      judged to be of high quality. Two studies were judged to be low quality and the
      quality of the other studies was unclear. Treatment of acute pouchitis: The
      results of one small study (16 participants) suggest that ciprofloxacin may be
      more effective than metronidazole for the treatment of acute pouchitis. One
      hundred per cent (7/7) of ciprofloxacin patients achieved remission at two weeks 
      compared to 33% (3/9) of metronidazole patients. A GRADE analysis indicated that 
      the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was very low due to
      high risk of bias (no blinding) and very sparse data (10 events). There was no
      difference in the proportion of patients who had at least one adverse event (RR
      0.18, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.98). Adverse events included vomiting, dysgeusia or
      transient peripheral neuropathy. There were no differences between metronidazole 
      and budesonide enemas in terms of clinical remission, clinical improvement or
      adverse events. Adverse events included anorexia, nausea, headache, asthenia,
      metallic taste, vomiting, paraesthesia, and depression. There were no differences
      between rifaximin and placebo in terms of clinical remission, clinical
      improvement, or adverse events. Adverse events included diarrhea, flatulence,
      nausea, proctalgia, vomiting, thirst, candida, upper respiratory tract infection,
      increased hepatic enzyme, and cluster headache. There was no difference in
      clinical improvement between Lactobacillus GG and placebo. The results of these
      studies are uncertain due to very low quality evidence. Treatment of chronic
      pouchitis: A pooled analysis of two studies (76 participants) suggests that VSL#3
      may be more effective than placebo for maintenance of remission. Eighty-five per 
      cent (34/40) of VLS#3 patients maintained remission at 9 to 12 months compared to
      3% (1/36) of placebo patients (RR 20.24, 95% CI 4.28 to 95.81). A GRADE analysis 
      indicated that the quality of evidence supporting this outcome was low due to
      very sparse data (35 events). Adverse events included abdominal cramps, vomiting 
      and diarrhea. There was no difference in effectiveness between glutamine and
      butyrate suppositories for maintenance of remission. There was no difference in
      clinical improvement or adverse event rates between bismuth carbomer foam enemas 
      and placebo. Adverse events included diarrhea, worsening symptoms, cramping,
      sinusitis, and abdominal pain. The results of these studies are uncertain due to 
      very low quality evidence. Prevention of pouchitis: The results of one small
      study (40 participants) suggest that VSL#3 may be more effective than placebo for
      prevention of pouchitis. Ninety per cent (18/20) of VSL#3 patients had no
      episodes of acute pouchitis during the 12 month study compared to 60% (12/20) of 
      placebo patients (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.21). A GRADE analysis indicated that 
      the quality of evidence supporting this outcome was low due to very sparse data
      (30 events). Another small study (28 participants) found that VLS#3 was not more 
      effective than no treatment for prevention of pouchitis. Bifidobacterium longum, 
      allopurinol and tinidazole were not more effective than placebo for prevention of
      pouchitis. The results of these studies are uncertain due to very low quality
      evidence. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: For acute pouchitis, very low quality evidence
      suggests that ciprofloxacin may be more effective than metronidazole. For chronic
      pouchitis, low quality evidence suggests that VSL#3 may be more effective than
      placebo for maintenance of remission. For the prevention of pouchitis, low
      quality evidence suggests that VSL#3 may be more effective than placebo. Well
      designed, adequately powered studies are needed to determine the optimal therapy 
      for the treatment and prevention of pouchitis.

AB  - The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is multifactorial with data 
      suggesting the role of a disturbed interaction between the gut and the intestinal
      microbiota. A defective mucosal barrier may result in increased intestinal
      permeability which promotes the exposition to luminal content and triggers an
      immunological response that promotes intestinal inflammation. IBD patients
      display several defects in the many specialized components of mucosal barrier,
      from the mucus layer composition to the adhesion molecules that regulate
      paracellular permeability. These alterations may represent a primary dysfunction 
      in Crohn's disease, but they may also perpetuate chronic mucosal inflammation in 
      ulcerative colitis. In clinical practice, several studies have documented that
      changes in intestinal permeability can predict IBD course. Functional tests, such
      as the sugar absorption tests or the novel imaging technique using confocal laser
      endomicroscopy, allow an in vivo assessment of gut barrier integrity. Antitumor
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) therapy reduces mucosal inflammation and
      restores intestinal permeability in IBD patients. Butyrate, zinc, and some
      probiotics also ameliorate mucosal barrier dysfunction but their use is still
      limited and further studies are needed before considering permeability
      manipulation as a therapeutic target in IBD.

TI  - Probiotic yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus CIDCA 8154 shows anti-inflammatory and
      anti-oxidative stress properties in in vivo models.
PG  - 83-93
LID - 10.3920/BM2015.0066 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are complex affections with increasing
      incidence worldwide. Multiple factors are involved in the development and
      maintenance of the symptoms including enhanced oxidative stress in intestinal
      mucosa. The conventional therapeutic approaches for IBDs are based on the use
      anti-inflammatory drugs with important collateral effects and partial efficacy.
      In the present work we tested the anti-inflammatory capacity of Kluyveromyces
      marxianus CIDCA 8154 in different models. In vitro, we showed that the
      pretreatment of epithelial cells with the yeast reduce the levels of
      intracellular reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, in a murine model of trinitro
      benzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis, yeast-treated animals showed a reduced
      histopathological score (P<0.05) and lower levels of circulating interleukin 6
      (P<0.05). The capacity to modulate oxidative stress in vivo was assessed using a 
      Caenorhabditis elegans model. The yeast was able to protect the nematodes from
      oxidative stress by modulating the SKN-1 transcription factor trough the DAF-2
      pathway. These results indicate that K. marxianus CIDCA 8154 could control the
      intestinal inflammation and cellular oxidative stress. Deciphering the mechanisms
      of action of different probiotics might be useful for the rational formulation of
      polymicrobial products containing microorganisms targeting different
      anti-inflammatory pathways.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease
      are chronic relapsing and remitting chronic diseases for which there is no cure. 
      The treatment of IBD frequently requires immunosuppressive and biologic therapies
      which carry an increased risk of infections and possible malignancy. There is a
      continued search for safer and more natural therapies in the treatment of IBD.
      This review aims to summarize the most current literature on the use of dietary
      supplements for the treatment of IBD. Specifically, the efficacy and adverse
      effects of vitamin D, fish oil, probiotics, prebiotics, curcumin, Boswellia
      serrata, aloe vera and cannabis sativa are reviewed.

AB  - This report summarises talks given at the 8th International Yakult Symposium,
      held on 23-24 April 2015 in Berlin. Two presentations explored different aspects 
      of probiotic intervention: the small intestine as a probiotic target and
      inclusion of probiotics into integrative approaches to gastroenterology.
      Probiotic recommendations in gastroenterology guidelines and current data on
      probiotic efficacy in paediatric patients were reviewed. Updates were given on
      probiotic and gut microbiota research in obesity and obesity-related diseases,
      the gut-brain axis and development of psychobiotics, and the protective effects
      of equol-producing strains for prostate cancer. Recent studies were presented on 
      probiotic benefit for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and people with HIV, as
      well as protection against the adverse effects of a short-term high-fat diet.
      Aspects of probiotic mechanisms of activity were discussed, including
      immunomodulatory mechanisms and metabolite effects, the anti-inflammatory
      properties of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, the relationship between
      periodontitis, microbial production of butyrate in the oral cavity and ageing,
      and the pathogenic mechanisms of Campylobacter. Finally, an insight was given on 
      a recent expert meeting, which re-examined the probiotic definition, advised on
      the appropriate use and scope of the term and outlined different probiotic
      categories and the prevalence of different mechanisms of activity.

AB  - Probiotics are foods or products that contain live microorganisms that benefit
      the host when administered. In this clinical review, we evaluate the literature
      associated with using probiotics in common pediatric gastrointestinal disorders, 
      focusing specifically on antibiotic-associated diarrhea, acute gastroenteritis,
      Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), colic, inflammatory bowel disease, and
      functional gastrointestinal diseases. Meta-analysis of several randomized
      controlled trials have confirmed benefit for the administration of Lactobacillus 
      rhamnosus GG and Saccharomyces boulardii to prevent antibiotic-associated
      diarrhea and to treat acute infectious diarrhea. Individual studies have also
      suggested benefit of probiotics to prevent acute gastroenteritis and serve as an 
      adjunct in ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, CDI,
      functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, and colic in breastfed
      babies. Although promising, larger well-designed studies need to confirm these
      findings. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend probiotics for
      the treatment of constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome or Crohn's
      disease.

PG  - 939-49
LID - 10.1007/s00595-015-1261-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, relapsing, and refractory disorder
      of the intestine. Total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) 
      is the preferred and standard surgical procedure for patients' refractory to
      medical therapy. Pouchitis is one of the most common long-term complications
      after IPAA. In the present study, the safety and efficacy of Clostridium
      butyricum MIYAIRI (CBM) as a probiotic were examined. METHODS: A randomized and
      placebo-controlled study was performed. Seventeen patients were recruited from
      2007 to 2013. Nine tablets of MIYA-BM((R)) or placebo were orally administered
      once daily. The cumulative pouchitis-free survival, pouch condition (using the
      modified pouch disease activity index), and blood parameters were evaluated. A
      fecal sample analysis was also performed. RESULTS: Subjects were randomly
      allocated to receive MIYA-BM or placebo (9 and 8 subjects, respectively). One
      subject in the MIYA-BM group and four subjects in the placebo group developed
      pouchitis. No side effects occurred in either group. Characteristic intestinal
      flora was observed in each group. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that probiotic
      therapy with CBM achieved favorable results with minimal side effects and might
      be a useful complementary therapy for the prevention of pouchitis in patients
      with UC who have undergone IPAA.

TI  - Identification of novel anti-inflammatory probiotic strains isolated from pulque.
PG  - 385-396
AB  - Probiotics are live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts,
      confer health benefits on the host. Their use is more and more widespread for
      both prevention and treatment of diseases, including traveler's diarrhea and
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). In this work, we isolated and characterized
      novel candidate probiotic strains from pulque (xaxtle), a traditional Mexican
      alcoholic fermented beverage. A total of 14 strains were obtained from xaxtle
      samples isolated from three different Mexican regions. Species identification was
      performed by biochemical methods and 16S rRNA gene targeted PCR. The isolates
      belonged to the Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus
      brevis, and Lactobacillus composti phylogenetic groups, with L. brevis being the 
      most dominant group. Bacteria were tested for lysozyme, low pH, and bile acid
      resistance. Moreover, the strains were tested for adherence to human intestinal
      epithelial cells and screened for their immunomodulatory properties using a
      cellular model. Selected bacterial strains with anti-inflammatory properties were
      then tested in vivo in a dinitro-benzene sulfonic acid (DNBS)-induced chronic
      colitis mouse model, and weight loss, gut permeability, and cytokine profiles
      were measured as readouts of inflammation. One of the selected strains,
      Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis LBH1068, improved mice health as observed by a
      reduction of weight loss, significant decreases in gut permeability, and cytokine
      modulation. Altogether, our results highlighted the potential of lactobacilli
      isolated from pulque and in particular the strain L. sanfranciscensis LBH1068 as 
      a novel probiotic to treat IBD.

AB  - Microscopic colitis is a common cause of chronic diarrhea. It is characterized by
      non-bloody watery diarrhea with macroscopically normal colonic mucosa. Its
      specific histological characteristics confirm the diagnosis. Two distinct
      histological forms can be identified, namely, collagenous colitis and lymphocytic
      colitis. In collagenous colitis, a thick colonic subepithelial collagenous
      deposit can be observed, whereas in lymphocytic colitis, a pronounced
      intraepithelial lymphocytic inflammation in the absence of a thickened collagen
      band can be identified. Microscopic colitis occurs more frequently in elderly
      females and its etiology is believed to be multifactorial, although smoking and
      consumption of several drugs have been identified as risks factors for the
      development of the disease. The treatment is based on avoiding the risks factors 
      and administration of oral budesonide.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, 
      and unclassified IBD, continues to cause significant morbidity. While its
      incidence is increasing, no clear etiology and no cure have yet been discovered. 
      Recent findings suggest that IBD may have a multifactorial etiology, where
      complex interactions between genetics, epigenetics, environmental factors
      (including diet but also infections, antibiotics, and sanitation), and host
      immune system lead to abnormal immune responses and chronic inflammation. Over
      the past years, the role of altered gut microbiota (in both composition and
      function) in IBD pathogenesis has emerged as an outstanding area of interest.
      According to new findings, gut dysbiosis may appear as a key element in
      initiation of inflammation in IBD and its complications. Moreover, complex
      metagenomic studies provide possibilities to distinguish between IBD types and
      appreciate severity and prognosis of the disease, as well as response to therapy.
      This review provides an updated knowledge of recent findings linking altered
      bacterial composition and functions, viruses, and fungi to IBD pathogenesis. It
      also highlights the complex genetic, epigenetic, immune, and microbial
      interactions in relation to environmental factors (including diet). We overview
      the actual options to manipulate the altered microbiota, such as modified diet,
      probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, antibiotics, and fecal transplantation.
      Future possible therapies are also included. Targeting altered microbiota could
      be the next therapeutic personalized approach, but more research and
      well-designed comparative prospective studies are required to formulate adequate 
      directions for prevention and therapy.

AB  - Rapid progress has been made to understand the pathophysiology of inflammatory
      bowel diseases and to identify new treatments. Interaction of the gut microbiota 
      on the host inflammatory response has suggested that alternative therapies, such 
      as probiotics, might have a complementary role in treating and preventing disease
      flares. Multiple probiotics and their formulations have been studied for both the
      induction and maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis (UC); however,
      mainly Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 and VSL#3 have been shown to provide
      significant benefits for the prevention and treatment of mild to moderate UC.
      Although these data are promising, there is still a paucity of robust,
      randomized-controlled trials to suggest that probiotics be utilized as part of a 
      standard treatment regimen. With continued research and a movement toward
      carefully selected, individualized management based on an individual's specific
      microbiota composition and function, probiotics may become an integral part of
      tailored therapy for UC.

AB  - The alterations in the gut microbiota observed in patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease and in particular in Crohn's disease and in ulcerative colitis
      patients with pouchitis, provide the rationale for administering probiotic agents
      in the medical treatment of those conditions. In the maintenance treatment of
      inactive Crohn's disease probiotics, when administered alone, were found
      ineffective in preventing clinical and/or endoscopic recurrence. By contrast, a
      combination of a probiotic agent (eg, Saccharomyces boulardii) with standard
      pharmacological therapy can promote clinical benefit. In patients with pouchitis,
      so far only the probiotic mixture VSL #3 proved to effectively prevent relapses
      after successful antibiotic treatment of active inflammation. Further controlled 
      studies, enrolling higher numbers of patients, are needed to better identify the 
      exact role of probiotics in this area.

AB  - Probiotics and prebiotics, mainly commercialised as food ingredients and also as 
      supplements, are considered highly profitable niche markets. However, in recent
      years, the food industry has suffered from a series of health claim restrictions 
      on probiotics and prebiotics in many parts of the world, including those made by 
      the European Food Safety Authority. Therefore, we reviewed the core benefits of
      probiotic and prebiotic consumption on health. A number of studies have examined 
      the prevention and/or management of intestinal infections, respiratory tract
      infections, CVD, osteoporosis, urogenital infections, cavities, periodontal
      disease and halitosis, allergic reactions, inflammatory bowel disease and
      irritable bowel syndrome and Helicobacter pylori gastric infections. In fact, a
      deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in human microbiota and immune
      system modulation by probiotics and prebiotics relies on continuous efforts to
      establish suitable biomarkers of health and diseases risk factors for the design 
      of clinical trials required for health claim approval. In spite of the promising 
      results, the performance of large, long-term, well-planned, well-aligned clinical
      studies is crucial to provide more reliability and a more solid basis for the
      outcomes achieved and to support the potential use of probiotics and prebiotics
      in clinical practice.

TI  - Colonization of C57BL/6 Mice by a Potential Probiotic Bifidobacterium bifidum
      Strain under Germ-Free and Specific Pathogen-Free Conditions and during
      Experimental Colitis.
PG  - e0139935
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0139935 [doi]
AB  - The effects of at least some probiotics are restricted to live, metabolically
      active bacteria at their site of action. Colonization of and persistence in the
      gastrointestinal tract is thus contributing to the beneficial effects of these
      strains. In the present study, colonization of an anti-inflammatory
      Bifidobacterium bifidum strain was studied in C57BL/6J mice under germ-free (GF) 
      and specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions as well as during dextran sulfate
      sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. B. bifidum S17/pMGC was unable to stably colonize
      C57BL/6J mice under SPF conditions. Mono-association of GF mice by three doses on
      consecutive days led to long-term, stable detection of up to 109 colony forming
      units (CFU) of B. bifidum S17/pMGC per g feces. This stable population was
      rapidly outcompeted upon transfer of mono-associated animals to SPF conditions. A
      B. animalis strain was isolated from the microbiota of these re-conventionalized 
      mice. This B. animalis strain displayed significantly higher adhesion to murine
      CMT-93 intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) than to human Caco-2 IECs (p = 0.018). 
      Conversely, B. bifidum S17/pMGC, i.e., a strain of human origin, adhered at
      significantly higher levels to human compared to murine IECs (p < 0.001).
      Disturbance of the gut ecology and induction of colitis by DSS-treatment did not 
      promote colonization of the murine gastrointestinal tract (GIT) by B. bifidum
      S17/pMGC. Despite its poor colonization of the mouse GIT, B. bifidum S17/pMGC
      displayed a protective effect on DSS-induced colitis when administered as viable 
      bacteria but not as UV-inactivated preparation. Collectively, these results
      suggest a selective disadvantage of B. bifidum S17/pMGC in the competition with
      the normal murine microbiota and an anti-inflammatory effect that requires live, 
      metabolically active bacteria.

TI  - Probiotic and anti-inflammatory attributes of an isolate Lactobacillus helveticus
      NS8 from Mongolian fermented koumiss.
PG  - 196
LID - 10.1186/s12866-015-0525-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Koumiss is a traditionally fermented mare's milk described with
      health-promoting potentials for decades. However, only a few studies focused on
      the probiotic strains isolated from koumiss. In this study, we collected koumiss 
      samples from Inner Mongolian pasturing area of China and selected a promising
      strain of Lactobacillus helveticus, isolate NS8, based on the survival abilities 
      in gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and adhesion to intestinal endothelial cells in
      vitro. As the ability to positively modulate host immune response is a feature of
      increasing importance in measuring the probiotic potential of a bacterial strain,
      our study mainly focus on the immunomodulatory properties of L. helveticus NS8 by
      using in vivo and ex vivo analyses. RESULTS: L. helveticus NS8 was identified by 
      molecular-typing methods, both at genus and species levels. As a typical food
      niche-specific bacteria, NS8 showed a moderate survival ability in GIT
      environment in vitro. However, an excellent binding capacity to the human
      intestinal epithelial cells, along with significant autoaggregation and
      cell-surface hydrophobicity was observed. Additionally, the presence of S-layer
      protein was responsible for the cell surface properties of this strain. NS8 was
      found to be rather protective against TNBS (2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic
      acid)-induced murine colitis. In the meantime, co-culture with NS8 induced an
      increased level of secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in peripheral
      blood mono-nuclear cells (PBMCs). Furthermore, NS8 was also able to diminish the 
      proinflammatory effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mouse macrophage cell line
      RAW264.7 by inducing higher levels of IL-10. Specially, adding of the purified
      S-layer protein didn't influence the production of IL-10. The specific
      ligand-host receptor interactions on the NS8 specific immune responses need to be
      learned further. CONCLUSION: In summary, L. helveticus NS8 exhibited good
      probiotic and particularly immunomodulatory properties, with a potential for
      development of functional food commercially or therapeutic adjuvant for
      inflammatory diseases.

      placebo-controlled multicenter trial.
PG  - 67-74
LID - 10.1111/den.12553 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: We conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled
      trial to investigate the efficacy of Bifidobacterium longum 536 (BB536)
      supplementation for induction of remission in Japanese patients with active
      ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Fifty-six patients with mild to moderate UC
      were enrolled. Three patients had pancolitis, 36 had left-sided colitis, and 17
      had proctitis. Patients were randomly treated with 2-3 x 10(11) freeze-dried
      viable BB536 (28 patients) or placebo (28 patients) for 8 weeks. RESULTS: In
      total, 63% of patients receiving BB536 showed clinical remission (UC disease
      activity index [UCDAI] </=2) at week 8 compared to 52% of those receiving placebo
      (P = 0.395). We observed a significant decrease of UCDAI scores (3.8 +/- 0.4 at
      baseline to 2.6 +/- 0.4 at week 8) in the BB536 group (P < 0.01), whereas there
      was no significant decrease in the placebo group (P = 0.88). There was also a
      significant decrease in the Rachmilewitz endoscopic index (EI) and the Mayo
      subscore at week 8 in the BB536 group, whereas there was no significant decrease 
      in the placebo group. A single patient in the BB536 group complained of a mild
      side-effect, but no other adverse effects were observed. CONCLUSION:
      Supplementation with BB536 was well tolerated and reduced UCDAI scores, EI and
      Mayo subscores after 8 weeks in Japanese patients with mild to moderately active 
      UC.

PG  - 521-5
LID - 10.1007/s00063-015-0078-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The complexity and diversity of the human intestinal microbiome has
      only recently been characterized. The multiple metabolic and immunologic effects 
      of the bacterial flora have demonstrated the symbiosis between the microbiome and
      its host. This symbiosis is disturbed in a multitude of diseases, especially in
      critically ill patients. OBJECTIVES: A review of the changes in the intestinal
      microbiome of critically ill patients and the use of probiotics. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: Nonsystematic literature search in PubMed on the topics: (1) changes in 
      the intestinal microbiome in critically ill patients, (2) interventions using
      probiotics in critically ill patients, and (3) use of fecal transplantation in
      Clostridium difficile colitis. RESULTS: Trauma, sepsis, systemic inflammatory
      response syndrome, and other conditions lead to shifts in the composition of the 
      intestinal microbiome, which are correlated with clinical outcome. The most
      obvious change is a profound loss of obligate anaerobe bacteria, leading also to 
      metabolic changes. Probiotics have been used in several studies and show efficacy
      in the reduction of infectious complication but not in overall mortality. C.
      difficile colitis as the model disease for a disturbed microbiome can be treated 
      effectively by transfer of donor feces, which also restores the diversity of the 
      microbiome. CONCLUSION: Taking into account the successful intervention of fecal 
      transplantation on the intestinal microbiome, new products developed using the
      current knowledge of the intestinal microbiome could be more effective.

TI  - Th17 Cells as Potential Probiotic Therapeutic Targets in Inflammatory Bowel
      Diseases.
PG  - 20841-58
LID - 10.3390/ijms160920841 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are characterized by wasting and chronic
      intestinal inflammation triggered by various cytokine-mediated pathways. In
      recent years, it was shown that T helper 17 (Th17) cells are involved in the
      pathogenesis of IBD, which makes them an attractive therapeutic target. Th17
      cells preferentially produce interleukin (IL)-17A-F as signature cytokines. The
      role of the interplay between host genetics and intestinal microbiota in the
      pathogenesis of IBD was demonstrated. Probiotics are live microorganisms that
      when orally ingested in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit to the host by 
      modulating the enteric flora or by stimulating the local immune system. Several
      studies indicated the effectiveness of probiotics in preventing and treating IBD 
      (ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease). Furthermore, there is mounting
      evidence of probiotics selectively targeting the Th17 lineage in the prevention
      and management of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as IBD. This review
      highlights critical roles of Th17 cells in the pathogenesis of IBD and the
      rationale for using probiotics as a novel therapeutic approach for IBD through
      manipulation of Th17 cells. The potential molecular mechanisms by which
      probiotics modulate Th17 cells differentiation and production are also discussed.

TI  - The gut microbiota and host health: a new clinical frontier.
PG  - 330-9
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2015-309990 [doi]
AB  - Over the last 10-15 years, our understanding of the composition and functions of 
      the human gut microbiota has increased exponentially. To a large extent, this has
      been due to new 'omic' technologies that have facilitated large-scale analysis of
      the genetic and metabolic profile of this microbial community, revealing it to be
      comparable in influence to a new organ in the body and offering the possibility
      of a new route for therapeutic intervention. Moreover, it might be more accurate 
      to think of it like an immune system: a collection of cells that work in unison
      with the host and that can promote health but sometimes initiate disease. This
      review gives an update on the current knowledge in the area of gut disorders, in 
      particular metabolic syndrome and obesity-related disease, liver disease, IBD and
      colorectal cancer. The potential of manipulating the gut microbiota in these
      disorders is assessed, with an examination of the latest and most relevant
      evidence relating to antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, polyphenols and faecal 
      microbiota transplantation.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory ability of
      novel indigenous probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum MCC 2759, L. fermentum MCC
      2760 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii MCC 2775 in a carrageenan induced acute
      inflammatory paw edema model. Probiotic cultures were administered to male Wistar
      rats via oral route. Carrageenan at a concentration of 1% was injected into hind 
      paw of rats 30min after oral gavage on the 8th day of treatment regimen. Paw
      thickness (mm), stair climbing activity and motility score were the parameters
      used to score the inflammatory response. L. fermentum MCC 2759, L. fermentum MCC 
      2760 and L. delbrueckii MCC 2775 showed significant reduction in paw thickness
      (P<0.05) showing percentage inhibition of 15.67%, 14.72% and 14.84%,
      respectively, 24h after carrageenan induction. Probiotic treatment also markedly 
      alleviated the stair climbing and motility score. Histological analysis of tissue
      sections revealed reduction in cellular infiltration of probiotic and drug
      treatment groups. Adhesion to resected rat intestinal tissue also showed
      significant adherence capability (>40%) of the probiotic cultures used.
      Therefore, L. fermentum MCC 2759, L. fermentum MCC 2760 and L. delbrueckii MCC
      2775 may be used as potent anti-inflammatory agents with probiotic health
      benefits.

AB  - Human skin is the first defense barrier against the external environment,
      especially microbial pathogens and physical stimulation. Many studies on skin
      health with Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have been published for many years,
      including prevention of skin disease and improvement of skin conditions. LAB, a
      major group of gram-positive bacteria, are known to be beneficial to human health
      by acting as probiotics. Recent studies have shown that LAB and their extracts
      have beneficial effects on maintenance and improvement of skin health. Oral
      administration of Lactobacillus delbrueckii inhibits the development of atopic
      disease. In addition, LAB and LAB extracts are known to have beneficial effects
      on intestinal diseases, with Lactobacillus plantarum having been shown to
      attenuate IL-10 deficient colitis. In addition to intestinal health, L. plantarum
      also has beneficial effects on skin. pLTA, which is lipoteichoic acid isolated
      from L. plantarum, has anti-photoaging effects on human skin cells by regulating 
      the expression matrix meralloprotionase-1 (MMP-1) expression. While several
      studies have proposed a relationship between diseases of the skin and small
      intestines, there are currently no published reviews of the effects of LAB for
      skin health through regulation of intestinal conditions and the immune system. In
      this review, we discuss recent findings on the effects of LAB on skin health and 
      its potential applications in beauty foods.

TI  - Bifidobacterium longum CCM 7952 Promotes Epithelial Barrier Function and Prevents
      Acute DSS-Induced Colitis in Strictly Strain-Specific Manner.
PG  - e0134050
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0134050 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reduced microbial diversity has been associated with inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) and probiotic bacteria have been proposed for its prevention 
      and/or treatment. Nevertheless, comparative studies of strains of the same
      subspecies for specific health benefits are scarce. Here we compared two
      Bifidobacterium longum ssp. longum strains for their capacity to prevent
      experimental colitis. METHODS: Immunomodulatory properties of nine probiotic
      bifidobacteria were assessed by stimulation of murine splenocytes. The immune
      responses to B. longum ssp. longum CCM 7952 (Bl 7952) and CCDM 372 (Bl 372) were 
      further characterized by stimulation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cell,
      HEK293/TLR2 or HEK293/NOD2 cells. A mouse model of dextran sulphate sodium
      (DSS)-induced colitis was used to compare their beneficial effects in vivo.
      RESULTS: The nine bifidobacteria exhibited strain-specific abilities to induce
      cytokine production. Bl 372 induced higher levels of both pro- and
      anti-inflammatory cytokines in spleen and dendritic cell cultures compared to Bl 
      7952. Both strains engaged TLR2 and contain ligands for NOD2. In a mouse model of
      DSS-induced colitis, Bl 7952, but not Bl 372, reduced clinical symptoms and
      preserved expression of tight junction proteins. Importantly, Bl 7952 improved
      intestinal barrier function as demonstrated by reduced FITC-dextran levels in
      serum. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that Bl 7952, but not Bl 372, protected mice
      from the development of experimental colitis. Our data suggest that although some
      immunomodulatory properties might be widespread among the genus Bifidobacterium, 
      others may be rare and characteristic only for a specific strain. Therefore,
      careful selection might be crucial in providing beneficial outcome in clinical
      trials with probiotics in IBD.

PG  - 1175-81

AB  - Pouchitis is the most frequent long-term complication of pouch surgery for
      ulcerative colitis. There is consistent evidence on the implication of bacterial 
      flora in the pathogenesis of pouchitis, and there is evidence for a therapeutic
      role of antibiotics and probiotics in therapy of this disease. Antibiotics,
      particularly ciprofloxacin and metronidazole, are the mainstay of treatment for
      acute pouchitis. In chronic refractory pouchitis, after having excluded other
      diagnoses (infections, Crohn's disease of the pouch, ischemia and irritable
      pouch), antibiotic combination therapy is the treatment of choice. The highly
      concentrated probiotic mixture VSL#3 has been shown to be effective in prevention
      of pouchitis onset and in maintaining antibiotic-induced remission.

TI  - Fragments of Citrullinated and MMP-degraded Vimentin and MMP-degraded Type III
      Collagen Are Novel Serological Biomarkers to Differentiate Crohn's Disease from
      Ulcerative Colitis.
PG  - 863-72
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv123 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A hallmark of inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] is chronic
      inflammation, which leads to excessive extracellular matrix [ECM] remodelling and
      release of specific protein fragments, called neoepitopes. We speculated that the
      biomarker profile panel for ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn's disease [CD]
      represent a heterogeneous expression pattern, and may be applied as a tool to aid
      in the differentiation between UC and CD. METHODS: Serum biomarkers of degraded
      collagens I, III-IV [C1M, C3M, and C4M], collagen type 1 and IV formation [P1NP, 
      P4NP], and citrullinated and MMP-degraded vimentin [VICM] were studied with a
      competitive ELISA assay system in a cohort including 164 subjects [CD n = 72, UC 
      n = 60, and non-IBD controls n = 32] and a validation cohort of 61 subjects [CD n
      = 46, and UC n = 15]. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and
      logistic regression modelling were carried out to evaluate the discriminative
      power of the biomarkers. RESULTS: All biomarkers were corrected for confounding
      factors. VICM and C3M demonstrated the highest diagnostic power, alone, to
      differentiate CD from UC with an area under the curve [AUC] of 0.77 and 0.69,
      respectively. Furthermore, the biomarkers C1M [AUC = 0.81], C3M [AUC = 0.83],
      VICM [AUC = 0.83], and P1NP [AUC = 0.77] were best to differentiate UC from
      non-IBD. The best combinations of biomarkers to differentiate CD from UC and UC
      from non-IBD were VICM, C3M, C4M [AUC = 0.90] and VICM, C3M [AUC = 0.98]
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Specific extracellular matrix degradation markers are 
      elevated in IBD and can discriminate CD from UC and UC from non-IBD controls with
      a high diagnostic accuracy.

TI  - The Roles of Inflammation, Nutrient Availability and the Commensal Microbiota in 
      Enteric Pathogen Infection.
LID - 10.1128/microbiolspec.MBP-0008-2014 [doi]
AB  - The healthy human intestine is colonized by as many as 1014 bacteria belonging to
      more than 500 different species forming a microbial ecosystem of unsurpassed
      diversity, termed the microbiota. The microbiota's various bacterial members
      engage in a physiological network of cooperation and competition within several
      layers of complexity. Within the last 10 years, technological progress in the
      field of next-generation sequencing technologies has tremendously advanced our
      understanding of the wide variety of physiological and pathological processes
      that are influenced by the commensal microbiota (1, 2). An increasing number of
      human disease conditions, such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), type 2
      diabetes, obesity, allergies and colorectal cancer are linked with altered
      microbiota composition (3). Moreover, a clearer picture is emerging of the
      composition of the human microbiota in healthy individuals, its variability over 
      time and between different persons and how the microbiota is shaped by
      environmental factors (i.e., diet) and the host's genetic background (4). A
      general feature of a normal, healthy gut microbiota can generate conditions in
      the gut that disfavor colonization of enteric pathogens. This is termed
      colonization-resistance (CR). Upon disturbance of the microbiota, CR can be
      transiently disrupted, and pathogens can gain the opportunity to grow to high
      levels. This disruption can be caused by exposure to antibiotics (5, 6), changes 
      in diet (7, 8), application of probiotics and drugs (9), and a variety of
      diseases (3). Breakdown of CR can boost colonization by intrinsic pathogens or
      increase susceptibility to infections (10). One consequence of pathogen expansion
      is the triggering of inflammatory host responses and pathogen-mediated disease.
      Interestingly, human enteric pathogens are part of a small group of bacterial
      families that belong to the Proteobacteria: the Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli,
      Yersinia spp., Salmonella spp., Shigella spp.), the Vibrionaceae (Vibrio
      cholerae) and the Campylobacteriaceae (Campylobacter spp.). In general, members
      of these families (be it commensals or pathogens) only constitute a minority of
      the intestinal microbiota. However, proteobacterial "blooms" are a characteristic
      trait of an abnormal microbiota such as in the course of antibiotic therapy,
      dietary changes or inflammation (11). It has become clear that the gut microbiota
      not only plays a major role in priming and regulating mucosal and systemic
      immunity, but that the immune system also contributes to host control over
      microbiota composition. These two ways of mutual communication between the
      microbiota and the immune system were coined as "outside-in" and "inside-out,"
      respectively (12). The significance of those interactions for human health is
      particularly evident in Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC). The
      symptoms of these recurrent, chronic types of gut inflammation are caused by an
      excessive immune response against one's own commensal microbiota (13). It is
      assumed that deregulated immune responses can be caused by a genetic
      predisposition, leading to, for example, the impairment of intestinal barrier
      function or disruption of mucosal T-cell homeostasis. In CD or UC patients, an
      abnormally composed microbiota, referred to as "dysbiosis," is commonly observed 
      (discussed later). This is often characterized by an increased relative abundance
      of facultative anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Enterobacteriaeceae, Bacilli) and, at
      the same time, depletion of obligate anaerobic bacteria of the classes
      Bacteroidia and Clostridia. So far, it is unclear whether dysbiosis is a cause or
      a consequence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In fact, both scenarios are
      equally conceivable. Recent work suggests that inflammatory immune responses in
      the gut (both IBD and pathogen-induced) can alter the gut luminal milieu in a way
      that favors dysbiosis (14). In this chapter, I present a survey on our current
      state of understanding of the characteristics and mechanisms underlying gut
      inflammation-associated dysbiosis. The role of dysbiosis in enteric infections
      and human IBD is discussed. In addition, I will focus on competition of enteric
      pathogens and the gut microbiota in the inflamed gut and the role of dysbiotic
      microbiota alterations (e.g., "Enterobacterial blooms" (11)) for the evolution of
      pathogenicity.

TI  - Vitamin D receptor pathway is required for probiotic protection in colitis.
PG  - G341-9
LID - 10.1152/ajpgi.00105.2015 [doi]
AB  - Low expression of vitamin D receptor (VDR) and dysfunction of vitamin D/VDR
      signaling are reported in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD);
      therefore, restoration of VDR function to control inflammation in IBD is
      desirable. Probiotics have been used in the treatment of IBD. However, the role
      of probiotics in the modulation of VDR signaling to effectively reduce
      inflammation is unknown. We identified a novel role of probiotics in activating
      VDR activity, thus inhibiting inflammation, using cell models and VDR knockout
      mice. We found that the probiotics Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG (LGG) and
      Lactobacillus plantarum (LP) increased VDR protein expression in both mouse and
      human intestinal epithelial cells. Using the VDR luciferase reporter vector, we
      detected increased transcriptional activity of VDR after probiotic treatment.
      Probiotics increased the expression of the VDR target genes, such as
      antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin, at the transcriptional level. Furthermore,
      the role of probiotics in regulating VDR signaling was tested in vivo using a
      Salmonella-colitis model in VDR knockout mice. Probiotic treatment conferred
      physiological and histologic protection from Salmonella-induced colitis in
      VDR(+/+) mice, whereas probiotics had no effects in the VDR(-/-) mice. Probiotic 
      treatment also enhanced numbers of Paneth cells, which secrete AMPs for host
      defense. These data indicate that the VDR pathway is required for probiotic
      protection in colitis. Understanding how probiotics enhance VDR signaling and
      inhibit inflammation will allow probiotics to be used effectively, resulting in
      innovative approaches to the prevention and treatment of chronic inflammation.

TI  - DYSMICROBISM, INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE AND THYROIDITIS: ANALYSIS OF THE
      LITERATURE.
PG  - 265-72
AB  - The human body is colonized by a large number of microbes that are collectively
      referred to as the microbiota. They interact with the hosting organism and some
      do contribute to the physiological maintenance of the general good health thru
      regulation of some metabolic processes while some others are essential for the
      synthesis of vitamins and short-chain fatty acids. The abnormal variation, in the
      quality and/or quantity of individual bacterial species residing in the
      gastro-intestinal tract, is called dysmicrobism. The immune system of the host
      will respond to these changes at the intestinal mucosa level which could lead to 
      Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD). This inflammatory immune response could
      subsequently extend to other organs and systems outside the digestive tract such 
      as the thyroid, culminating in thyroiditis. The goal of the present study is to
      review and analyze data reported in the literature about thyroiditis associated
      with inflammatory bowel diseases such as Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohns
      Disease (CD). It was reported that similarities of some molecular bacterial
      components with molecular components of the host are considered among the factors
      causing IBD through an autoimmune reaction which could involve other non-immune
      cell types. The axis dysmicrobism-IBD-autoimmune reaction will be investigated as
      a possible etiopathogenic mechanism to Autoimmune Thyroiditis. If such is the
      case, then the employment of specific probiotic strains may represent a useful
      approach to moderate the immune system.

AB  - Presystemic interactions with gut microbiota might play important roles in the
      holistic action of herbal medicines in their traditional oral applications.
      However, research interests usually focus on biologic activities of the in vivo
      available herb-derived components and their exposure in circulation. In this
      study, we illustrated the importance of studying the presystemic interplay with
      gut microbiota for understanding the holistic actions of medicinal herbs by using
      calycosin-7-O-beta-D-glucoside (C7G), the most abundant flavonoid and chemical
      marker in Astragali Radix, as a model compound. When C7G was orally administrated
      to rats, calycosin-3'-O-glucuronide (G2) was the major circulating component in
      the blood together with a minor calycosin but not C7G. Rat gut microbiota
      hydrolyzed C7G in vitro rapidly and produced its aglycone calycosin. Calycosin
      exhibited higher permeability than C7G and further underwent extensive
      glucuronidation to yield 3'-glucuronide as the dominant metabolite. Bioactivity
      assays revealed that G2 exhibited similar or more potent proangiogenic effects
      than calycosin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro and in the
      vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor II-induced 
      blood vessel loss model in zebrafish. More interestingly, the incubation of C7G
      with gut microbiota from both normal and colitic rats showed a probiotics-like
      effect through stimulating the growth of the beneficial bacteria Lactobacillus
      and Bifidobacterium. In conclusion, C7G interacts reciprocally with gut
      microbiota after oral dosing, which makes it not only an angiogenic prodrug but
      also a modulator of gut microbiota.

TI  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli infection has donor-dependent effect on human 
      gut microbiota and may be antagonized by probiotic yeast during interaction with 
      Peyer's patches.
PG  - 9097-110
LID - 10.1007/s00253-015-6704-0 [doi]
AB  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) are major food-borne pathogens
      responsible for serious infections ranging from mild diarrhea to hemorrhagic
      colitis and life-threatening complications. Shiga toxins (Stxs) are the main
      virulence factor of EHEC. The antagonistic effect of a prophylactic treatment
      with the probiotic strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae against EHEC O157:H7 was
      investigated using complementary in vitro human colonic model and in vivo murine 
      ileal loop assays. In vitro, the probiotic treatment had no effect on O157:H7
      survival but favorably influenced gut microbiota activity through modulation of
      short-chain fatty acid production, increasing acetate production and decreasing
      that of butyrate. Both pathogen and probiotic strains had individual-dependent
      effects on human gut microbiota. For the first time, stx expression was followed 
      in human colonic environment: at 9 and 12 h post EHEC infection, probiotic
      treatment significantly decreased stx mRNA levels. Besides, in murine ileal
      loops, the probiotic yeast specifically exerted a trophic effect on intestinal
      mucosa and inhibited O157:H7 interactions with Peyer's patches and subsequent
      hemorrhagic lesions. Taken together, the results suggest that S. cerevisiae may
      be useful in the fight against EHEC infection and that host associated factors
      such as microbiota could influence clinical evolution of EHEC infection and the
      effectiveness of probiotics.

TI  - Breakthrough Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG bacteremia associated with probiotic use 
      in an adult patient with severe active ulcerative colitis: case report and review
      of the literature.
PG  - 777-81
LID - 10.1007/s15010-015-0798-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics are widely investigated in the treatment of various bowel 
      diseases. However, they may also have a pathogenic potential, and the role of
      Lactobacillus spp. as opportunistic pathogens, mostly following disruption of the
      intestinal mucosa, is emerging. CASE REPORT: We report on a case of bacteremia
      caused by L. rhamnosus GG in an adult patient affected by severe active
      ulcerative colitis under treatment with corticosteroids and mesalazine.
      Lactobacillus bacteremia was associated with candidemia and occurred while the
      patient was receiving a probiotic formulation containing the same strain (as
      determined by PFGE typing), and was being concomitantly treated with i.v.
      vancomycin, to which the Lactobacillus strain was resistant. L. rhamnosus GG
      bacteremia, therefore, was apparently related with translocation of bacteria from
      the intestinal lumen to the blood. CONCLUSIONS: Pending conclusive evidence, use 
      of probiotics should be considered with caution in case of active severe
      inflammatory bowel diseases with mucosal disruption.

TI  - Effectiveness of probiotic therapy for the prevention of relapse in patients with
      inactive ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 5985-94
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v21.i19.5985 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of probiotic therapy for suppressing relapse
      in patients with inactive ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Bio-Three tablets,
      each containing 2 mg of lactomin (Streptococcus faecalis T-110), 10 mg of
      Clostridium butyricum TO-A, and 10 mg of Bacillus mesentericus TO-A, were used as
      probiotic therapy. Sixty outpatients with UC in remission were randomly assigned 
      to receive 9 Bio-Three tablets/day (Bio-Three group) or 9 placebo tablets/day
      (placebo group) for 12 mo in addition to their ongoing medications. Clinical
      symptoms were evaluated monthly or on the exacerbation of symptoms or need for
      additional medication. Fecal samples were collected to analyze bacterial DNA at
      baseline and 3-mo intervals. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism
      and cluster analyses were done to examine bacterial components of the fecal
      microflora. RESULTS: Forty-six patients, 23 in each group, completed the study,
      and 14 were excluded. The relapse rates in the Bio-Three and placebo groups were 
      respectively 0.0% vs 17.4% at 3 mo (P = 0.036), 8.7% vs 26.1% at 6 mo (P =
      0.119), and 21.7% vs 34.8% (P = 0.326) at 9 mo. At 12 mo, the remission rate was 
      69.5% in the Bio-Three group and 56.6% in the placebo group (P = 0.248). On
      cluster analysis of fecal flora, 7 patients belonged to cluster I, 32 to cluster 
      II, and 7 to cluster III. CONCLUSION: Probiotics may be effective for maintaining
      clinical remission in patients with quiescent UC, especially those who belong to 
      cluster I on fecal bacterial analysis.

AB  - Intestinal immune homeostasis is regulated by gut microbiota, including
      beneficial and pathogenic microorganisms. Imbalance in gut bacterial constituents
      provokes host proinflammatory responses causing diseases such as inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD). The development of next-generation sequencing technology
      allows the identification of microbiota alterations in IBD. Several studies have 
      shown reduced diversity in the gut microbiota of patients with IBD. Advances in
      gnotobiotic technology have made possible analysis of the role of specific
      bacterial strains in immune cells in the intestine. Using these techniques, we
      have shown that Clostridium butyricum as a probiotic induces
      interleukin-10-producing macrophages in inflamed mucosa via the Toll-like
      receptor 2/myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 pathway to prevent
      acute experimental colitis. In this review, we focus on the new approaches for
      the role of specific bacterial strains in immunological responses, as well as the
      potential of bacterial therapy for IBD treatments.

AB  - Immunomodulatory antibiotics have been proposed for the treatment of
      multifactorial conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease. Probiotics are able
      to attenuate intestinal inflammation, being considered as safe when chronically
      administered. The aim of the study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects 
      of doxycycline, a tetracycline with immunomodulatory properties, alone and in
      association with the probiotic Saccharomyces boulardii CNCMI-745. Doxycycline was
      assayed both in vitro (Caco-2 epithelial cells and RAW 264.7 macrophages) and in 
      vivo, in the trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) model of rat colitis and the
      dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model of mouse colitis. In addition, the
      anti-inflammatory effect of the association of doxycycline and the probiotic was 
      evaluated in vitro and in vivo in a DSS model of reactivated colitis in mice.
      Doxycycline displayed immunomodulatory activity in vitro, reducing IL-8
      production by intestinal epithelial cells and nitric oxide by macrophages.
      Doxycycline administration to TNBS-colitic rats (5, 10 and 25 mg/kg) ameliorated 
      the intestinal inflammatory process, being its efficacy comparable to that
      previously showed by minocycline. Doxycycline treatment was also effective in
      reducing acute intestinal inflammation in the DSS model of mouse colitis. The
      association of doxycycline and S. boulardii helped managing colitis in a
      reactivated model of colitis, by reducing intestinal inflammation and
      accelerating the recovery and attenuating the relapse. This was evidenced by a
      reduced disease activity index, colonic tissue damage and expression of
      inflammatory mediators. This study confirms the intestinal anti-inflammatory
      activity of doxycycline and supports the potential use of its therapeutic
      association with S. boulardii for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases,
      in which doxycycline is used to induce remission and long term probiotic
      administration helps to prevent the relapses.

TI  - Bifidobacteria Enhance Antigen Sampling and Processing by Dendritic Cells in
      Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
PG  - 1491-8
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000389 [doi]
AB  - Bifidobacteria have been reported to reduce inflammation and contribute to
      intestinal homeostasis. However, the interaction between these bacteria and the
      gut immune system remains largely unknown. Because of the central role played by 
      dendritic cells (DCs) in immune responses, we examined in vitro the effects of a 
      Bifidobacteria mixture (probiotic) on DC functionality from children with
      inflammatory bowel disease. DCs obtained from peripheral blood monocytes of
      patients with Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis, and noninflammatory bowel
      disease controls (HC) were incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated particles of
      Escherichia coli or DQ-Ovalbumin (DQ-OVA) after a pretreatment with the
      probiotic, to evaluate DC phenotype, antigen sampling and processing. Moreover,
      cell supernatants were collected to measure tumor necrosis factor alpha,
      interferon gamma, interleukin 17, and interleukin 10 production by enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay. DCs from CD children showed a higher bacteria particles
      uptake and DQ-OVA processing after incubation with the probiotic; in contrast, DC
      from both ulcerative colitis and HC showed no significant changes. Moreover, a
      marked tumor necrosis factor alpha release was observed in DC from CD after
      exposure to E. coli particles, whereas the probiotic did not affect the
      production of this proinflammatory cytokine. In conclusion, the Bifidobacteria
      significantly improved the antigen uptake and processing by DCs from patients
      with CD, which are known to present an impaired autophagic functionality,
      whereas, in DCs from ulcerative colitis and HC, no prominent effect of probiotic 
      mixture was observed. This improvement of antigen sampling and processing could
      partially solve the impairment of intestinal innate immunity and reduce
      uncontrolled microorganism growth in the intestine of children with inflammatory 
      bowel disease.

AB  - Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) are a group of diarrheagenic
      bacteria associated with foodborne outbreaks. Infection with these agents may
      result in grave sequelae that include fatality. A large number of STEC serotypes 
      has been identified to date. E. coli serotype O104:H4 is an emerging pathogen
      responsible for a 2011 outbreak in Europe that resulted in over 4000 infections
      and 50 deaths. STEC pathogenicity is highly reliant on the production of one or
      more Shiga toxins that can inhibit protein synthesis in host cells resulting in a
      cytotoxicity that may affect various organ systems. Antimicrobials are usually
      avoided in the treatment of STEC infections since they are believed to induce
      bacterial cell lysis and the release of stored toxins. Some antimicrobials have
      also been reported to enhance toxin synthesis and production from these
      organisms. Various groups have attempted alternative treatment approaches
      including the administration of toxin-directed antibodies, toxin-adsorbing
      polymers, probiotic agents and natural remedies. The utility of antibiotics in
      treating STEC infections has also been reconsidered in recent years with certain 
      modalities showing promise.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of diseases characterized by
      inflammation of the small and large intestine and primarily includes ulcerative
      colitis and Crohn's disease. Although the etiology of IBD is not fully
      understood, it is believed to result from the interaction of genetic,
      immunological, and environmental factors, including gut microbiota. Recent
      studies have shown a correlation between changes in the composition of the
      intestinal microbiota and IBD. Moreover, it has been suggested that probiotics
      and prebiotics influence the balance of beneficial and detrimental bacterial
      species, and thereby determine homeostasis versus inflammatory conditions. In
      this review, we focus on recent advances in the understanding of the role of
      prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics in functions of the gastrointestinal tract
      and the induction and maintenance of IBD remission. We also discuss the role of
      psychobiotics, which constitute a novel class of psychotropic agents that affect 
      the central nervous system by influencing gut microbiota.

AB  - Do food ecosystems feed gut ecosystems? And if so... fuel the immune system?
      Recent developments in metagenomics have provided researchers tools to open the
      "black box" of microbiome science. These novel technologies have enabled the
      establishment of correlations between dysbiotic microbial communities and many
      diseases. The complex interaction of the commensal microbiota with the immune
      system is a topic of substantial interest due to its relevance to health. The
      human gastrointestinal tract is composed of an immense number of resident and
      transient microorganisms. Both may play a direct and vital role in the
      maintenance of human health and well-being. An understanding of the interactions 
      and mechanisms through which commensal and food-derived microbes shape host
      immunity and metabolism may yield new insights into the pathogenesis of many
      immune-mediated diseases. Consequently, by manipulating the contribution of food 
      microbiota to the functionality of the gut ecosystem, there is great hope for
      development of new prophylactic and therapeutic interventions. This paper
      presents some insights and comments on the possible impact of exogenous fermented
      food microbes on the gut homeostasis. We shed light on the similar features
      shared by both fermented food microbes and probiotics. In particular, the key
      role of microbial strains as part of food ecosystems for health and diseases is
      discussed through the prism of fermented dairy products and gut inflammation.

TI  - The use of probiotics in pediatric gastroenterology: a review of the literature
      and recommendations by Latin-American experts.
PG  - 199-216

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The stability and composition of intestinal flora plays a vital role
      in human wellbeing throughout life from as early as birth. Over the past 50
      years, several studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of probiotic
      administration in pediatric gastroenterology. This document aims to provide a
      recommendation score on probiotic utilization in pediatric gastroenterology,
      together with a review of current knowledge concerning its benefits,
      tolerability, and safety. STUDY DESIGN: Published literature was selected without
      study design restriction: clinical guidelines, meta-analyses, randomized
      controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, outcomes research and case-controlled
      studies were selected using the following MESH-validated terms: probiotics,
      diarrhea, acute diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, traveler's diarrhea,
      bacterial diarrhea, nosocomial diarrhea, prophylactic diarrhea, Helicobacter
      pylori infection, colic, infantile colic, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC),
      inflammatory bowel disease, constipation, and allergy. Once the validity and the 
      quality of results were evaluated, a recommendation score and level of evidence
      were assigned for pediatric gastrointestinal-related conditions, according to the
      updated Evidence-Based Medicine guidelines: 1a for systematic review (SR) of
      RCTs, 1b for individual RCT, 1c for SR and individual RCT, 2a for SR of cohort
      studies, 2b for individual cohort studies, 2c for outcomes research, and 3a for
      SR of case-control studies. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The Latin American Expert
      group consensus recommends the use of the following probiotics for pediatric
      gastrointestinal conditions: prevention of acute infectious diarrhea (AID): 1b
      for Bifidobacterium lactis, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), and L. reuteri;
      prevention of nosocomial diarrhea: 1 b for B. lactis Bb12, B. bifidum, LGG and
      Streptococcus thermophiles; treatment of AID: 1a for LGG and S. boulardii, 1b for
      L. reuteri; prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea: 1b for LGG and S.
      boulardii; prevention of traveler's diarrhea: 1b for S. boulardii; prevention of 
      infantile colic: 1a for L. reuteri DSM 17938; treatment of infantile colic: 1b
      for L. reuteri DSM 17938; prevention of NEC: 1a for B. breve, mixtures of
      Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus, LGG, L. acidophilus and L. reuteri DSM 17938; 
      induction and maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis: 1b for VSL#3;
      improving symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome: 2c for LGG and VSL#3.

TI  - The role of probiotic lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria in the prevention
      and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and other related diseases: a
      systematic review of randomized human clinical trials.
PG  - 505878
LID - 10.1155/2015/505878 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn's disease (CD) and
      ulcerative colitis (UC), is a chronic inflammation of the small intestine and
      colon caused by a dysregulated immune response to host intestinal microbiota in
      genetically susceptible subjects. A number of fermented dairy products contain
      lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and bifidobacteria, some of which have been
      characterized as probiotics that can modify the gut microbiota and may be
      beneficial for the treatment and the prevention of IBD. The objective of this
      review was to carry out a systematic search of LAB and bifidobacteria probiotics 
      and IBD, using the PubMed and Scopus databases, defined by a specific equation
      using MeSH terms and limited to human clinical trials. The use of probiotics
      and/or synbiotics has positive effects in the treatment and maintenance of UC,
      whereas in CD clear effectiveness has only been shown for synbiotics.
      Furthermore, in other associated IBD pathologies, such as pouchitis and
      cholangitis, LAB and bifidobacteria probiotics can provide a benefit through the 
      improvement of clinical symptoms. However, more studies are needed to understand 
      their mechanisms of action and in this way to understand the effect of probiotics
      prior to their use as coadjuvants in the therapy and prevention of IBD
      conditions.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease frequently causes intestinal obstruction because of
      extensive fibrosis. This study investigated whether polyphosphate (poly P), an
      active molecule derived from Lactobacillus brevis, could improve the fibrosis in 
      a model of chronic colitis. In this study, dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced
      chronic colitis models and trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis
      models were used as models of fibrosis. To clarify the mechanism responsible for 
      the observed effects, Caco-2/brush border epithelial (BBE) and naive T helper
      lymphocyte (THP)-1 cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce
      inflammation. Non-cancer human colon fibroblast (CCD-18) cells were treated with 
      transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta1) to induce fibrosis. The expression 
      levels of fibrosis- and inflammation-associated molecules were evaluated by both 
      a Western blotting analysis and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
      (RT-PCR). The histologic inflammation and fibrosis were significantly improved in
      the group administered poly P in both the DSS and TNBS colitis models. The levels
      of interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) were 
      significantly decreased by poly P treatment. The expression levels of TGF-beta1
      and collagens in the colitis mice were decreased by poly P. The LPS-induced
      expressions of IL-1beta and TGF-beta1 in Caco-2/BBE cells and of TNF-alpha in
      THP-1 cells were reduced by poly P treatment. Poly P did not affect the
      expression of collagens and connective tissue growth factor in the CCD-18 cells. 
      In conclusion, poly P suppresses intestinal inflammation and fibrosis by
      downregulating the expression of inflammation- and fibrosis-associated molecules 
      in the intestinal epithelium. The administration of poly P is therefore a novel
      option to treat fibrosis because of chronic intestinal inflammation.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The medical management of ulcerative colitis (UC) has improved
      through the development of new therapies and novel approaches that optimize
      existing drugs. Previous Canadian consensus guidelines addressed the management
      of severe UC in the hospitalized patient. We now present consensus guidelines for
      the treatment of ambulatory patients with mild to severe active UC. METHODS: A
      systematic literature search identified studies on the management of UC. The
      quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were rated according to the
      Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)
      approach. Statements were developed through an iterative online platform and then
      finalized and voted on by a working group of specialists. RESULTS: The
      participants concluded that the goal of therapy is complete remission, defined as
      both symptomatic and endoscopic remission without corticosteroid therapy. The
      consensus includes 34 statements focused on 5 main drug classes:
      5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA), corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, anti-tumor
      necrosis factor (TNF) therapies, and other therapies. Oral and rectal 5-ASA are
      recommended first-line therapy for mild to moderate UC, with corticosteroid
      therapy for those who fail to achieve remission. Patients with moderate to severe
      UC should undergo a course of oral corticosteroid therapy, with transition to
      5-ASA, thiopurine, anti-TNF (with or without thiopurine or methotrexate), or
      vedolizumab maintenance therapy in those who successfully achieve symptomatic
      remission. For patients with corticosteroid-resistant/dependent UC, anti-TNF or
      vedolizumab therapy is recommended. Timely assessments of response and remission 
      are critical to ensuring optimal outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Optimal management of UC 
      requires careful patient assessment, evidence-based use of existing therapies,
      and thorough assessment to define treatment success.

AB  - Probiotics have been used as alternative therapies in intestinal inflammatory
      disorders. Many studies have shown that different bacterial probiotic strains
      possess immuno-modulatory and anti-inflammatory properties. However, there is an 
      increasing interest in the use of non-viable bacteria to reduce the risk of
      microbial translocation and infection. The aim of this study was to evaluate
      whether the viability of L. fermentum CECT5716 is essential to exert its
      intestinal anti-inflammatory effect. We compared the preventative effects of
      viable and non-viable probiotic in the TNBS model of rat colitis. In vitro
      studies were also performed in Caco-2 and RAW 264.7 cells to evaluate the
      probiotic effects on IL-8, IL-1beta and nitrite production, and p44/42 and p38
      MAP kinase protein expressions. In vitro results revealed a decrease in the
      stimulated production of pro-inflammatory mediators regardless of the viability
      of the probiotic. Likewise, both forms of the probiotic administered to colitic
      rats produced a significant reduction of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha levels and
      colonic iNOS expression. In conclusion, both live and dead L. fermentum CECT5716 
      have been demonstrated to attenuate the inflammatory process and diminish the
      production of some of the inflammatory mediators. In fact, the viability of this 
      probiotic did not affect its immuno-modulatory and anti-inflammatory properties.

      interventions on the microbiome?
PG  - 781-95
LID - 10.1586/17474124.2015.1013031 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis, is a chronic, relapsing and remitting set of conditions characterized by
      an excessive inflammatory response leading to the destruction of the
      gastrointestinal tract. While the exact etiology of inflammatory bowel disease
      remains unclear, increasing evidence suggests that the human gastrointestinal
      microbiome plays a critical role in disease pathogenesis. Manipulation of the gut
      microbiome has therefore emerged as an attractive alternative for both
      prophylactic and therapeutic intervention against inflammation. Despite its
      growing popularity among patients, review of the current literature suggests that
      the adult microbiome is a highly stable structure resilient to short-term
      interventions. In fact, most evidence to date demonstrates that therapeutic
      agents targeting the microflora trigger rapid changes in the microbiome, which
      then reverts to its pre-treatment state once the therapy is completed. Based on
      these findings, our ability to treat inflammatory bowel disease through
      short-term manipulations of the human microbiome may only have a transient
      effect. Thus, this review is intended to highlight the use of various therapeutic
      options, including diet, pre- and probiotics, antibiotics and fecal microbiota
      transplant, to manipulate the microbiome, with specific attention to the
      alterations made to the microflora along with the duration of impact.

TI  - Advances in knowledge on microscopic colitis: From bench to bedside.
PG  - 98-108
AB  - Microscopic colitis (MC) is a general term that describes a family of chronic
      inflammatory bowel diseases, including lymphocytic colitis (LC) and collagenous
      colitis (CC). The two forms are characterized by chronic watery diarrhea with
      normal or near normal endoscopic colonic appearance and specific
      histopathological abnormalities.Data from recent epidemiological studies reported
      the diagnosis of MC from several different regions in the world, providing that
      it can be a worldwide condition. The etiopathogenesis of MC still remains unknown
      but it is generally accepted that MC is a multifactorial disease, probably
      secondary to an abnormal immune reaction in predisposed individuals, triggered by
      different luminal factors (infections, drugs, autoimmunity and/or bile acids).
      Furthermore, some studies show that the epithelial barrier function in the
      colonic mucosa of MC patients is also impaired. Several mucosal factors of
      intestinal inflammation have been studied in MC, postulating that an aberrant
      T-lymphocyte response may lead to a chronic gut inflammatory condition, with the 
      infiltration of colonic mucosa by different proportion of subset of
      T-lymphocytes. Little is known about the specific inflammatory mediators in MC
      pathogenesis, but a predominant Th1 type cytokine profile has been demonstrated. 
      Currently, a number of medical treatments have been studied in MC patients,
      following mainly an empirical treatment approach. Further studies are needed in
      order to obtain prospective and more evidence-based data. In the future, it will 
      be possible to develop causal treatment approaches after better understanding the
      molecular mechanisms behind the origin of the disease.

TI  - Screening of the novel colicinogenic gram-negative rods against pathogenic
      Escherichia coli O157:H7.
PG  - 67-72
LID - 10.4103/0255-0857.150895 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157:H7 is gram-negative enteric pathogen
      producing different types of Shiga toxin. This bacterium is the most corporate
      cause of haemorrhagic colitis in human. Administration of antibiotics
      (particularly sulfa drugs) against this pathogen is a debatable topic as this may
      increase the risk of uremic syndrome; especially in children and aged people.
      Around the world, microbiologists are in search of alternative therapeutic
      methods specially probiotics against this pathogen. In the present study, we have
      focused on the investigation of alternate bio-therapeutics (probiotics) for the
      treatment of patients infected with E. coli O157:H7. This study is based on the
      identification of colicin-producing gram-negative bacteria (particularly
      enterobacteriaceae) which can competently exclude E. coli O157:H7 from the gut of
      the infected individual. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hundred samples from human,
      animal faeces and septic tank water were analysed for nonpathogenic gram-negative
      rods (GNRs). RESULTS: Out of these samples, 175 isolates of GNRs were checked for
      their activity against E. coli O157:H7. Only 47 isolates inhibited the growth of 
      E. coli O157:H7, among which majority were identified as E. coli. These E. coli
      strains were found to be the efficient producers of colicin. Some of the closely 
      related species i. e., Citrobacter sp, Pantoea sp. and Kluyvera sp. also showed
      considerable colicinogenic activity. Moreover, colicinogenic species were found
      to be nonhaemolytic, tolerant to acidic environment (pH 3) and sensitive to
      commonly used antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Nonhaemolytic, acid tolerant and sensitive
      to antibiotics suggests the possible use of these circulating endothelial cells
      (CEC) as inexpensive and inoffensive therapeutic agent (probiotics) in E. coli
      O157:H7 infections.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Many Chinese herbs are traditionally used as
      medicine to improve the functions of gastrointestinal tract. Some of these herbs 
      are also promising agents for the improvement of the gut microbiota and the
      treatment of ulcerative colitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: By screening seven
      traditional Chinese herbs, we found that Red Ginseng and Semen Coicis were the
      most effective in promoting the growth of probiotics including Lactobacillus and 
      Bifidobacterium in vitro. We then evaluated the effects of Red Ginseng and Semen 
      Coicis on the growth of the bacterial pathogens (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus
      aureus, and Salmonella spp.) in vitro. In in vivo experiment, we gavage
      administrated trinitro-benzene-sulfonic acid induced ulcerative colitis (UC) rats
      with Red Ginseng and Semen Coicis extracts. After two weeks treatment, we
      analyzed the structure of the gut microbiota and examined the UC symptoms by
      employing qPCR and animal pathology detection techniques. RESULTS: Both Red
      Ginseng and Semen Coicis promoted the growth of probiotics - Bifidobacterium and 
      Lactobacillus in vitro. Red Ginseng also inhibited the growth of some pathogen
      strains. In vivo, Red Ginseng and Semen Coicis improved the structure of gut
      microbiota and relieved the symptoms of ulcerative colitis in vivo. Compared with
      Semen Coicis, Red Ginseng was more effective in relieving the symptoms of
      ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Red Ginseng could promote the growth of
      probiotic bacteria in vitro. Red Ginseng and, to a lesser extent Semen Coicis,
      gave positive results in an experimental in vivo model for ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Faecal microbiota transplant - prospects and safety.
PG  - 282-6
AB  - The intestinal microbiota, either directly or indirectly, plays an important role
      in maintaining the homeostasis of the body. The intestine microorganisms are
      significant due to the role they play in stimulating the development of the
      immune system, protecting against pathogens, and also managing metabolic and
      nutrient processing. The effectiveness of probiotics and prebiotics in various
      gastrointestinal diseases has been repeatedly confirmed. However, increasing
      interest in faecal transplantation has also been observed. Its efficacy in the
      treatment of pseudomembranous colitis has been repeatedly demonstrated. More
      often this method is discussed regarding the possibility of using it in other
      diseases linked with dysbiosis. Faecal microbiota transplantation, because of its
      rapid efficacy, minimal risk and adverse effects, relatively low cost, and the
      ability to re-establish the correct intestinal microbiota profile, could be an
      alternative treatment method in several other diseases. This paper will introduce
      the latest therapeutic aspects of microbiota transplantation, including its
      implications in the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic debilitating disorders of unknown 
      etiology, consisting of two main conditions, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
      disease. Major advances have recently taken place in human genetic studies of IBD
      and over 160 risk loci for these two diseases have been uncovered. These genetic 
      data highlight a key role for genes that code for immunological and epithelial
      barrier functions. Environmental factors also make substantial contributions to
      the pathogenesis of IBD and account for the growing incidence of the diseases
      around the world. Intestinal microbiota creates resistance to infection, provides
      nutrients, and educates the immune system and in many ways has a significant
      impact on human health. Aberrant microbiota composition and decreased diversity
      (dysbiotic microbiota) are key etiopathological events in IBD. Dysbiotic
      microbiota can lead to loss of normal, regulatory immune effects in the gut
      mucosa. This may play a central role in the development and perpetuation of
      chronic inflammation. Further, the expression of specific innate immune receptors
      that recognize microbes is altered in the IBD epithelium. Therefore, the
      combination of host side epithelial barrier functions and the presence of
      dysbiotic microbiota in the gut together promote inflammation. New therapeutic
      options targeting microbiota are currently considered for IBD and they may, in
      the future, provide means to reverse the pathogenic host-microbiota relationship 
      into a symbiotic one. In this review, the focus is on the intestinal microbiota
      and host-microbe interactions in IBD.

AB  - Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens M1 (M1) has been shown to possess many different
      beneficial health effects including anti-colitis activity. The purpose of this
      study was to develop a novel and easily scaled-up encapsulating technique that
      would improve the temperature tolerance of the bacterium and reduce the
      sensitivity of the organism to gastrointestinal fluid. A mixture of sodium
      alginate, gellan gum and skim milk powder was used as a coating material to
      entrap M1. The M1 gel was then directly freeze dried in order to dehydrate the
      covering and form microcapsules. The viable cell numbers of M1 present only
      dropped ten folds after the freeze-drying encapsulation process. The viable cell 
      counts remained constant at 5 x 10(7) CFU/g after heating from 25 degrees C to 75
      degrees C and holding at 75 degrees C for 1 min. The viable cell counts were
      reduced to 10(6) CFU/g and 10(5) CFU/g after 8-week storage at 4 degrees C and
      subsequent heat treatment with simulated gastrointestinal fluid test (SGFT) and
      bile salts, respectively. The effect of encapsulated M1 on the organism's
      anti-colitis activity was evaluated using the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)
      induced colitis mouse model. An in vivo study indicated that administration of
      heat treated encapsulated M1 was able to ameliorate DSS-induced colitis producing
      a significant reduction in the bleeding score and an attenuation of inflammatory 
      score. These findings clearly demonstrate that encapsulation of M1 using this
      novel technique is able to provide good protection from temperature changes and
      SGFT treatment and also does not affect the organism's anti-colitis activity.

AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are intestinal disorders that
      comprise the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). These disorders have a
      significant effect on the quality of life of affected patients and the increasing
      number of IBD cases worldwide is a growing concern. Because of the overall burden
      of IBD and its multifactorial etiology, efforts have been made to improve the
      medical management of these inflammatory conditions. The classical therapeutic
      strategies aim to control the exacerbated host immune response with
      aminosalicylates, antibiotics, corticosteroids, thiopurines, methotrexate and
      anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) biological agents. Although successful in the
      treatment of several CD or UC conditions, these drugs have limited effectiveness,
      and variable responses may culminate in unpredictable outcomes. The ideal therapy
      should reduce inflammation without inducing immunosuppression, and remains a
      challenge to health care personnel. Recently, a number of additional approaches
      to IBD therapy, such as new target molecules for biological agents and cellular
      therapy, have shown promising results. A deeper understanding of IBD pathogenesis
      and the availability of novel therapies are needed to improve therapeutic
      success. This review describes the overall key features of therapies currently
      employed in clinical practice as well as novel and future alternative IBD
      treatment methods.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic inflammatory conditions,
      characterised by remissions and relapses episodes, whose main manifestations are 
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Ulcerative colitis (UC), one of the main 
      forms of IBD, has as standard treatment the use of corticosteroids and
      anti-inflammatory drugs. The use of antibiotics has been also reported, but the
      possible adverse effects, such as disturbance of the indigenous microbiota or
      resistance induction, should be taken into consideration, and thus the use of
      probiotics emerges as a possible alternative option of treatment. In this study, 
      the oral administration of Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis BB-02 was
      evaluated as a preventive strategy for acute experimental UC induced in female
      BALB/c mice by ingestion of 3.5% dextran sulphate sodium in drinking water during
      7 days. During this time, the daily disease activity index was evaluated, and on 
      the seventh day the animals were euthanised to collect intestines and liver for
      analysis. Treatment with the probiotic resulted in clinical improvement of the
      animals. The histological and morphometric analyses showed a reduction of lesions
      and oedema in the gut, but there was no increase in the production of mucin. The 
      dosage of secretory immunoglobulin A was significantly higher in the colitis
      group and reduced in the group treated with the probiotic. There was also a
      reduction in the inflammation of the colon, as demonstrated by a decrease in
      neutrophils infiltration, and KC/CXCL-1 levels. The intestinal permeability,
      which is typically increased during the onset of IBD, was also reduced by
      treatment with probiotic. Based on these data, it can be concluded that the
      bacterium B. infantis BB-02 has a probiotic potential for the attenuation of UC, 
      but further studies should be conducted to verify the mechanism of protective
      action of the bacterium.

      disease in children.

LID - 10.3920/BM2014.0067 [doi]
AB  - Underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a
      common disorder characterized by abdominal pain associated to a change in stool
      consistency or frequency, include low-grade inflammation and intestinal
      microbiota changes. Few and disappointing data are available for prebiotics. A
      few controlled trials (RCTs) of probiotics are instead available with favourable 
      effects, although most are limited by suboptimal design and small sample size. A 
      recent report from the Rome foundation group included 32 RCTs of probiotics, most
      of which showed an overall modest improvement in symptoms, with the patients most
      benefitting from probiotics being those with predominant diarrhoea and those
      having a post-infectious IBS. A review focusing only on children with functional 
      gastrointestinal disorders concluded that probiotics are more effective than
      placebo in the treatment of patients with abdominal pain-related functional
      gastrointestinal disorders, although no effect on constipation was evident. The
      role for probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) appears logical: the
      endogenous intestinal microbiota plays a central role in their development, and
      various probiotics have been found effective in animal models of IBD. However,
      research in humans has been overall quite limited, and it would seem that after a
      phase of intense research in the first decade of this century, the pace has
      slowed down, with fewer clinical trials been published in the past 2-3 years. To 
      summarize current evidence: no probiotic has proven successful in Crohn's
      disease. In ulcerative colitis, on the other hand, data are more promising, and a
      very recent meta-analysis, that included 23 randomized controlled trials,
      concluded that there is evidence of efficacy for the probiotic mixture VSL#3 in
      helping inducing and maintaining remission, as well as in maintaining remission
      in patients with pouchitis. It is fair to state that for both IBD and IBS, more
      well-designed, rigorous, randomized clinical trials must be performed.

TI  - Fecal microbial transplant via nasogastric tube for active pediatric ulcerative
      colitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC), a chronic inflammatory disease of the large 
      intestine, is characterized by a dysregulated immune reaction. UC is associated
      with fecal dysbiosis. Human and animal studies support the fact that the
      gastrointestinal microbiome may trigger the intestinal immune response, resulting
      in UC. Fecal microbial transplantation (FMT), by changing the gastrointestinal
      microbiome of patients with UC, may be a therapeutic option. METHODS: Four
      patients with moderate symptoms defined by the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis
      Activity Index were enrolled in a prospective, open-label study of FMT via
      nasogastric tube in pediatric UC (US Food and Drug Administration IND 14942).
      After the donor and patient evaluation, patients received FMT with follow-up
      evaluations at 2, 6, and 12 weeks after transplantation. Study subjects were
      maintained on their pretransplant medications. The Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis
      Activity Index score, C-reactive protein, and stool calprotectin were completed
      during each study visit. RESULTS: Four patients with UC were enrolled (all boys).
      Ages ranged from 13 to 16 years. Patients tolerated FMT without adverse effects. 
      None of the patients clinically improved with FMT, nor were there any significant
      changes in stool calprotectin or laboratory values, including C-reactive protein,
      albumin, and hematocrit. Three individuals received additional standard medical
      therapies before the end of the study. CONCLUSIONS: This study, although showing 
      that single-dose FMT via nasogastric tube is well tolerated in active pediatric
      UC, did not show any clinical or laboratory benefit.
