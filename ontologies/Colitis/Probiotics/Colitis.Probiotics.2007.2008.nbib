TI  - Biologic therapies against inflammatory bowel disease: a dysregulated immune
      system and the cross talk with gastrointestinal mucosa hold the key.
PG  - 195-212
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a GI tract disorder that manifests as either 
      Ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD). The precise etiology of IBD is
      still not completely elucidated but research into the immunopathogenesis of IBD
      suggests that dysfunctions of the intestinal immune system and cross-reactivity
      against host epithelial cells hold the key. In both UC and CD, polarized immune
      activity towards Th1 (marked by upregulation of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IFN-gamma,
      IL-6) and Th17 (marked by IL-17 secretion) response is reported, while UC appears
      to exhibit an added contribution of Th2 responses (characterized by secretion of 
      IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13). Additionally, other molecules involved in leukocyte
      trafficking (adhesion molecules), chemokines (IL-8) and tissue repair molecules
      (PGE(2) and its receptors) are also crucial. Emergence of these new paradigms in 
      the pathogenesis of IBD led to a recent trend of novel biological therapies that 
      specifically inhibit molecules involved in the inflammatory cascade. In this
      review, we critically discuss recent advances in the pathogenesis of IBD, drug
      therapies (conventional versus biologic), drug efficacy and pharmacokinetics
      (murine versus human versus chimeric) and their adverse effects. We also discuss 
      emerging novel biological therapies targeting pro-inflammatory cytokines
      including TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma, cytokine receptors and those targeting
      adhesion molecules-anti-integrin and anti-ICAM antibodies. Other potential
      approaches using anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10), anti-sense oligonucleotide 
      and probiotics are also discussed. Finally, we summarized few imperative targets 
      whose more detailed exploration can help to pave the way for an efficacious IBD
      therapy.

AB  - Immune homeostasis at mucosal level results from controlled response to
      intestinal luminal antigens. Recent insights into the nature of inflammatory
      bowel diseases, derived mainly from studies of experimental models of colonic
      inflammation, strongly suggest that they can result from a loss of immune
      tolerance to antigens in the bacterial microflora. Investigations of the
      regulatory mechanisms operating at the mucosal level suggest that regulatory
      cells reactive to the intestinal microflora might play a role in cross-reactive
      protection toward different antigens. Expansion of microflora-reactive regulatory
      cells by probiotic administration is able to protect from experimental colitis.
      Characterization of regulatory cells in response to normal commensal flora, the
      basis of their development and the role of innate immunity in this process might 
      contribute to the understanding of the development of inflammatory bowel
      diseases.

AB  - Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis, are recurrent and aggressive inflammatory disorders that are most likely
      the result of an overly aggressive immune response to ubiquitous intestinal
      antigens in a genetically susceptible host. Despite decades of intense research, 
      our knowledge of factors causing IBD remains incomplete and, therefore,
      conventional therapy to induce and maintain remission works in a symptomatic
      fashion, merely suppressing the immune response. Probiotic bacteria have long
      been known to confer health benefits, especially with regard to intestinal
      disorders. Although there is mounting evidence from in vitro and animal
      experiments supporting the use of probiotics in IBD, clinical trials have not
      provided definite evidence for the therapeutic effect of probiotic therapy in IBD
      to date. This is with the notable exception of pouchitis and the maintenance of
      remission in ulcerative colitis, whereas Crohn's disease and active ulcerative
      colitis do not seem amenable to probiotic intervention. The next 5 years will see
      more trials targeting specific clinical settings using tailor-made probiotic
      combinations, taking into account our increasing knowledge of individual
      probiotic properties and the diversity of these microorganisms.

PG  - 1829-37
LID - 10.1517/13543780802514500 [doi]
AB  - Collagenous and lymphocytic colitis are the two recognized major presentations of
      microscopic colitis. Both diseases present with chronic watery diarrhea and a
      chronic inflammatory infiltrate in the colonic mucosa without specific endoscopic
      abnormalities, and hence diagnosis is established by histology. Recent
      epidemiological studies suggest that microscopic colitis may affect as many
      patients as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. The cause of these diseases is
      unknown; however, several lines of evidence support the hypothesis of mucosal
      injury from an unknown agent in the fecal stream. Due to the lack of disease
      causality, therapeutic management of microscopic colitis is now directed
      primarily at symptoms' resolution or improvement. Based on current evidence, oral
      budesonide represents an effective treatment option for patients with microscopic
      colitis to achieve and maintain remission. Other anti-inflammatory drugs such as 
      mesalazine or bismuth subsalicylate are now under evaluation. The optimal
      long-term management strategy of microscopic colitis, however, remains an
      unsolved issue.

TI  - Optimizing conventional therapy for inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 585-90
AB  - Recently, conventional therapies for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have not
      received the same amount of attention as biologic therapies, yet they remain the 
      backbone of therapy for IBD because of their efficacy, safety, and relatively low
      cost. Advances in efficacy and safety continue because of modifications in drug
      dosing and monitoring. Higher doses of mesalamine per pill, together with
      once-daily dosing, may help to optimize drug delivery and patient compliance.
      Budesonide, an effective agent for both induction and short-term remission
      maintenance in Crohn's disease, is devoid of many of the toxicities common to
      corticosteroids. Assessments of thiopurine methyltransferase and metabolite
      levels are helping to fine-tune dose optimization for the thiopurines
      azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine. The oral calcineurin inhibitors tacrolimus and
      cyclosporine have been shown to have expanded roles in IBD, and methotrexate may 
      be useful in some patients with refractory ulcerative colitis. Probiotics are
      showing promise for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease, ulcerative
      colitis, and pouchitis.

AB  - Diverticular disease (DD) of the colon is common. This paper reviews the evidence
      supporting the role of some of the conventional medical therapies such as fiber
      and nonabsorbable antibiotics in the treatment of DD. More importantly, it will
      review the emerging body of evidence supporting the use of 5-aminosalicylic acid 
      and probiotics for symptomatic or complicated DD. Possible mechanisms supporting 
      the role of 5-aminosalicylates will also be discussed. On the basis of strength
      of the evidence supporting each medical intervention, recommendations will be
      graded in an evidence-based fashion. Finally, an evidence-based algorithmic
      approach is proposed for the medical management of DD. This paper does not
      discuss the use of absorbable antibiotics such as ciprofloxin and metronidazole, 
      which are discussed in all standard textbooks. The purpose of this paper is to
      discuss newer recommendations.

AB  - A decrease in the abundance and biodiversity of intestinal bacteria within the
      dominant phylum Firmicutes has been observed repeatedly in Crohn disease (CD)
      patients. In this study, we determined the composition of the mucosa-associated
      microbiota of CD patients at the time of surgical resection and 6 months later
      using FISH analysis. We found that a reduction of a major member of Firmicutes,
      Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, is associated with a higher risk of postoperative
      recurrence of ileal CD. A lower proportion of F. prausnitzii on resected ileal
      Crohn mucosa also was associated with endoscopic recurrence at 6 months. To
      evaluate the immunomodulatory properties of F. prausnitzii we analyzed the
      anti-inflammatory effects of F. prausnitzii in both in vitro (cellular models)
      and in vivo [2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS)-induced] colitis in mice.
      In Caco-2 cells transfected with a reporter gene for NF-kappaB activity, F.
      prausnitzii had no effect on IL-1beta-induced NF-kappaB activity, whereas the
      supernatant abolished it. In vitro peripheral blood mononuclear cell stimulation 
      by F. prausnitzii led to significantly lower IL-12 and IFN-gamma production
      levels and higher secretion of IL-10. Oral administration of either live F.
      prausnitzii or its supernatant markedly reduced the severity of TNBS colitis and 
      tended to correct the dysbiosis associated with TNBS colitis, as demonstrated by 
      real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis. F. prausnitzii exhibits
      anti-inflammatory effects on cellular and TNBS colitis models, partly due to
      secreted metabolites able to block NF-kappaB activation and IL-8 production.
      These results suggest that counterbalancing dysbiosis using F. prausnitzii as a
      probiotic is a promising strategy in CD treatment.

TI  - Microbial biofilm communities in the gastrointestinal tract.
PG  - S142-3
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0b013e31816207df [doi]
AB  - The human gastrointestinal tract is colonized throughout its length by complex
      luminal and mucosal microbiotas. Owing to sampling restrictions, most of the
      studies done to date have concentrated on luminal material. Recently, however,
      there has been an upsurge in interest in the role of microbial communities that
      occur in biofilms on surfaces in the gut. In the human biota, biofilms have been 
      shown to exist on artificial surfaces and devices implanted in the host, on
      particulate materials in the gut lumen, and on the colonic mucosa. Owing to their
      proximity to host tissues, mucosal bacteria interact more readily with the gut
      epithelium and immune system than their luminal counterparts, and recent research
      indicates that they play an important role in health and disease processes.
      Because bacteria growing in biofilms are more resistant to antibiotics than their
      luminal counterparts, there is increased interest in the use of alternative
      therapeutic strategies to target potential pathogens on the mucosal surface,
      especially with respect to applications involving probiotics, prebiotics, and
      synbiotics.

AB  - Balsalazide is a 5-amino salicylic acid prodrug well-tolerated and effective in
      treating acute ulcerative colitis. VSL[sharp]3, a high-potency probiotic mixture,
      has proved to be effective in preventing flare-ups of chronic pouchitis and in
      obtaining remission of mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. Recent studies found 
      the association of low-dose balsalazide/VLS no. 3 effective in treating
      mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis and in preventing the recurrence of
      uncomplicated diverticulitis of the colon. In this paper, the framework for using
      this association to treat ulcerative colitis or to prevent the recurrence of
      colonic diverticulitis is reviewed, and 2 studies on this therapeutic approach
      are briefly summarized.

      of ulcerative colitis in children and adolescents: an open-label pilot study.
PG  - 874-5
LID - 10.1055/s-2008-1027463 [doi]
AB  - Since about 20 % of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) are children and
      adolescents there is a need for therapeutic options custom-tailored to the
      children's needs. E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) as an evidence-based probiotic
      alternative to mesalazine (5-ASA) in adult UC remission maintenance is a
      promising agent for such a therapy. The present open-labelled pilot study was
      undertaken to investigate the clinical benefit of EcN for maintenance therapy in 
      young UC patients. 34 patients with UC in remission aged between 11 and 18 years 
      were allocated either to EcN (2 capsules o. d., n = 24) or 5-ASA (median 1.5 g/d,
      n = 10) and observed over one year. As a result, the relapse rate was 25 % (6 /
      24) in the EcN group and 30 % (3 / 10) in the 5-ASA group. Data on the patients' 
      global health and development were favourable and no serious adverse events were 
      reported. In conclusion, maintenance therapy for UC with the probiotic EcN is
      effective also in young patients.

LID - 10.1152/ajpgi.90227.2008 [doi]
AB  - Live probiotic bacteria are effective in reducing gut permeability and
      inflammation. We have previously shown that probiotics release peptide bioactive 
      factors that modulate epithelial resistance in vitro. The objectives of this
      study were to determine the impact of factors released from Bifidobacteria
      infantis on intestinal epithelial cell permeability and tight junction proteins
      and to assess whether these factors retain their bioactivity when administered to
      IL-10-deficient mice. B. infantis conditioned medium (BiCM) was applied to T84
      human epithelial cells in the presence and absence of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma.
      Transepithelial resistance (TER), tight junction proteins [claudins 1, 2, 3, and 
      4, zonula occludens (ZO)-1, and occludin] and MAP kinase activity (p38 and ERK)
      were examined. Acute effects of BiCM on intestinal permeability were assessed in 
      colons from IL-10-deficient mice in Ussing chambers. A separate group of
      IL-1-deficient mice was treated with BiCM for 4 wk and then assessed for
      intestinal histological injury, cytokine levels, epithelial permeability, and
      immune response to bacterial antigens. In T84 cells, BiCM increased TER,
      decreased claudin-2, and increased ZO-1 and occludin expression. This was
      associated with enhanced levels of phospho-ERK and decreased levels of
      phospho-p38. BiCM prevented TNF-alpha- and IFN-gamma-induced drops in TER and
      rearrangement of tight junction proteins. Inhibition of ERK prevented the
      BiCM-induced increase in TER and attenuated the protection from TNF-alpha and
      IFN-gamma. Oral BiCM administration acutely reduced colonic permeability in mice 
      whereas long-term BiCM treatment in IL-10-deficient mice attenuated inflammation,
      normalized colonic permeability, and decreased colonic and splenic IFN-gamma
      secretion. In conclusion, peptide bioactive factors from B. infantis retain their
      biological activity in vivo and are effective in normalizing gut permeability and
      improving disease in an animal model of colitis. The effects of BiCM are mediated
      in part by changes in MAP kinases and tight junction proteins.

TI  - Manipulation of intestinal microbial flora for therapeutic benefit in
      inflammatory bowel diseases: review of clinical trials of probiotics, pre-biotics
      and synbiotics.
PG  - 167-84
AB  - Pathogenesis of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases(Ulcerative Colitis, Crohn's disease
      and Pouchitis) includes an abnormal immunological response to disturbed
      intestinal microflora. Therapeutic strategies are designed to intervene in these 
      abnormal host microbial communications. A novel approach in the last decade has
      been to use other bacteria or selective foods to induce beneficial bacteria to
      normalize inflammation. In this review we discuss rationale for such use and
      describe 46 clinical trials gleaned from the literature. Reports are divided into
      type, indications, and agents used. The search revealed 15 nonrandomized and 31
      randomized trials. Of the latter 23 were double-blind and 8 were open-label
      randomized controlled. In 32 of the total, different probiotics were used, while 
      10 and 4 used different prebiotics or synbiotics respectively. In 14
      nonrandomized trials, outcome was successful. In the randomized controlled trials
      12 of 16 ulcerative colitis but only 2 of Crohn's disease trials of biotic
      therapy were successful. No superiority of any probiotic was clearly evident, but
      a multi-agent mixture, VSL3# may be better suited in ulcerative colitis and
      pouchitis while the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG appears less useful in
      inflammatory bowel disease, especially Crohn's disease. Further studies with
      uniform stringent criteria are needed to provide proof of this therapy in
      inflammatory bowel disease.

AB  - Probiotic bacteria are normal inhabitants of microflora and may confer several
      benefits, including prevention against intestinal inflammation. However, the
      exact mode of action of probiotics is still largely unknown. The first line of
      defense against the entry of pathogens is represented by the gut membrane barrier
      and probiotics may prevent pathogen-induced membrane damage by inhibiting
      pathogen adhesion and maintaining the correct organization of the tight junction 
      and cytoskeleton proteins. The gut immune system should not only protect the
      mucosa against pathogens, but also avoid hypersensitivity reactions to food
      proteins and normal microflora. Failure of induction or maintenance of oral
      tolerance has been postulated to be a cause of food allergy. Feeding probiotic
      bacteria may prevent or ameliorate the onset of allergic disease and the
      associated inflammatory reactions through mechanisms involving modulation of T
      regulatory cells. Breakdown in tolerance toward intestinal bacteria is a primary 
      cause of inflammatory bowel disease. Recent studies have shown that probiotics
      may ameliorate experimental colitis in mice by inducing interleukin 10 and
      interleukin 10-dependent T regulatory cells. In this article, an update of the
      anti-inflammatory activity of different probiotics and of the more accredited
      mechanisms underlying such activities are reported.

TI  - [The efficacy of probiotics in gastrointestinal disease].
PG  - 1385-90
AB  - Probiotics are live microbial feed supplement which beneficially affects the host
      animals by improving its microbial balance. Probiotics have been used in the
      treatment of bacterial or viral induced acute intestinal infection. In recent
      years, some clinical studies have shown the therapeutic effects of probiotics in 
      the treatment of chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or prevention of
      allergic disease. Evidence exists for therapeutic use of probiotics in acute
      infectious diarrhea, Clostridium difficile colitis and antibiotic-associated
      diarrhea. Their exact role in IBD, irritable bowel syndrome and prevention of
      cancer has not to be determined. This review summarized the data about probiotics
      in gastrointestinal diseases and examine the mechanisms of action related to
      their therapeutic effects.

AB  - Probiotic research and clinical trials have been forging ahead over the last
      decade. Although much has been learnt in relation to probiotic intestinal
      epithelial-mucosal immune interactions, the evidence for substantial clinical
      efficacy of probiotics continues to progress much slower. This review outlines
      the probiotic clinical studies before 2005 that formed the foundation of
      probiotic clinical trials in inflammatory bowel disease and then examines indepth
      those inflammatory bowel disease probiotic clinical trials published after 2005
      that are leading to new understanding of the role of probiotics in the induction 
      and remission of inflammatory bowel disease in humans.

TI  - Anti-inflammatory activity of probiotic Bifidobacterium: enhancement of IL-10
      production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from ulcerative colitis patients
      and inhibition of IL-8 secretion in HT-29 cells.
PG  - 2511-6
AB  - AIM: To determine the anti-inflammatory activity of probiotic Bifidobacteria in
      Bifidobacteria-fermented milk (BFM) which is effective against active ulcerative 
      colitis (UC) and exacerbations of UC, and to explore the immunoregulatory
      mechanisms. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) from UC patients 
      or HT-29 cells were co-cultured with heat-killed probiotic bacteria or culture
      supernatant of Bifidobacterium breve strain Yakult (BbrY) or Bifidobacterium
      bifidum strain Yakult (BbiY) to estimate the amount of IL-10 or IL-8 secreted.
      RESULTS: Both strains of probiotic Bifidobacteria contained in the BFM induced
      IL-10 production in PBMNC from UC patients, though BbrY was more effective than
      BbiY. Conditioned medium (CM) and DNA of both strains inhibited IL-8 secretion in
      HT-29 cells stimulated with TNF-alpha, whereas no such effect was observed with
      heat-killed bacteria. The inhibitory effect of CM derived from BbiY was greater
      than that of CM derived from BbrY. DNAs of the two strains had a comparable
      inhibitory activity against the secretion of IL-8. CM of BbiY induced a
      repression of IL-8 gene expression with a higher expression of IkappaB-zeta mRNA 
      4 h after culture of HT-29 cells compared to that in the absence of CM.
      CONCLUSION: Probiotic Bifidobacterium strains in BFM enhance IL-10 production in 
      PBMNC and inhibit IL-8 secretion in intestinal epithelial cells, suggesting that 
      BFM has anti-inflammatory effects against ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Interventions for treating collagenous colitis.
PG  - CD003575
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD003575.pub5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Collagenous colitis is a cause of chronic diarrhea. Treatment has
      been based mainly on anecdotal evidence. This review was performed to identify
      therapies for collagenous colitis that have been proven in randomized trials.
      OBJECTIVES: To determine effective treatments for patients with collagenous
      colitis. SEARCH STRATEGY: Relevant papers published between 1970 and December
      2007 were identified via the MEDLINE and PUBMED databases. Manual searches from
      the references of identified papers, as well as review papers on collagenous or
      microscopic colitis were performed to identify additional studies. Abstracts from
      major gastroenterological meetings were searched to identify research submitted
      in abstract form only. Finally, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and the
      Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Functional Bowel Disorders Group
      Specialized Trials Register were searched for other studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: 
      Ten randomized trials were identified. Seven of these compared active treatment
      to placebo for treating active disease. Of these, 1 trial studied bismuth
      subsalicylate, 1 trial studied Boswellia serrata extract, 3 trials studies
      budesonide, 1 trial studied prednisolone, and 1 trial studied probiotics. One
      trial compared mesalamine to mesalamine + cholestyramine for treating active
      disease. Two trials compared budesonide to placebo in maintaining response
      induced by budesonide. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted
      independently by each author onto 2x2 tables (treatment versus comparator and
      response versus no response). For therapies assessed in one trial only, P-values 
      were derived using the chi-square test. For therapies assessed in more than one
      trial, summary test statistics were derived using the Peto odds ratio and 95%
      confidence intervals. Data were combined for analysis only if the outcomes were
      sufficiently similar in definition. MAIN RESULTS: In treating active disease,
      there were 9 patients with collagenous colitis in the trial studying bismuth
      subsalicylate (nine 262 mg tablets daily for 8 weeks). Clinical response occurred
      in 100% of patients who received bismuth subsalicylate compared to 0% of patients
      who received placebo (P = 0.03). Thirty-one patients were enrolled in the trial
      studying Boswellia serrata extract (three 400 mg capsules daily for 8 weeks).
      Clinical response occurred in 44% of patients who received Boswellia serrata
      extract compared to 27% of patients who received placebo (P = 0.32). A total of
      94 patients were enrolled in 3 trials studying budesonide (9 mg daily or in a
      tapering schedule for 6 to 8 weeks). Clinical response occurred in 81% of
      patients who received budesonide compared to 17% of patients who received placebo
      (P < 0.00001). The pooled odds ratio for clinical response to treatment with
      budesonide was 12.32 (95% CI 5.53 to 27.46), with a number needed to treat of 2
      patients. Statistically significant histological response occurred with treatment
      in all 3 trials studying budesonide therapy. Eleven patients were enrolled in the
      trial studying prednisolone (50 mg daily for 2 weeks). Clinical response occurred
      in 63% of patients who received prednisolone compared to 0% who received placebo 
      (P = 0.15). Twenty-nine patients were enrolled in the trial studying probiotics
      (2 capsules containing 0.5 x 10(10) CFU each of L. acidophilus LA-5 and B.
      animalis subsp. lactis strain BB-12 twice daily for 12 weeks). Clinical response 
      occurred in 29% of patients who received probiotics compared to 13% of patients
      who received placebo (P = 0.38). Twenty-three patients were enrolled in the trial
      studying mesalamine (800 mg three times daily) with or without cholestyramine (4 
      g daily) for 6 months. Clinical response occurred in 73% of patients who received
      mesalamine alone compared to 100% of patients who received mesalamine +
      cholestyramine (P = 0.14). In maintaining response, 80 patients who had responded
      to open-label budesonide were enrolled in 2 trials studying budesonide (6 mg
      daily for 6 months). Clinical response was maintained in 83% of patients who
      received budesonide compared to 28% of patients who received placebo (P =
      0.0002). The pooled odds ratio for maintenance of clinical response to treatment 
      with budesonide was 8.40 (95% CI 2.73 to 25.81), with a number needed to treat of
      2 patients. Histological response was maintained in 48% of patients who received 
      budesonide compared to 15% of patients who received placebo (P = 0.002). AUTHORS'
      CONCLUSIONS: Budesonide is effective for inducing and maintaining clinical and
      histological response in patients with collagenous colitis. The evidence for
      benefit with bismuth subsalicylate and for mesalamine with or without
      cholestyramine is weak. There is no evidence for the effectiveness of Boswellia
      serrata extract, prednisolone, or probiotics. These agents and other therapies
      require further study.

AB  - There is mounting evidence that probiotic therapy may alter disease expression in
      both animal models of IBD and in patients with IBD. The effects appear to be
      modest at best and may reflect the choice of probiotic organism, the variability 
      in concentrations of organisms administered, and the variability of the diseases 
      being treated. This review examines the data of all fully published articles
      currently available for the role of probiotics in the treatment of IBD.

AB  - The same drugs are used to treat hemorrhagic rectocolitis (HRC) and Crohn's
      disease (CD), although the aims are very different. Aminosalicylates are highly
      beneficial in HRC but virtually ineffective in CD, a disease in which
      immunosuppressants are more useful. Aminosalicylates exert their antiinflammatory
      effect directly on the lesions. Various oral and rectal preparations have been
      developed in order to deliver the active molecule to the intestinal target
      segment. These drugs are now known to act by stimulating the nuclear receptor
      PPAR-gamma, and this knowledge should help with the development of new agents.
      Chronic aminosalicylate treatment appears to diminish the risk of malignant
      transformation. Systemic steroids are still the mainstay of treatment for
      exacerbations of HRC and CD, yielding remissions in 60 to 90% of cases. In
      contrast, systemic steroids should not be used for maintenance therapy.
      Budesonide is a preparation that selectively releases steroids in the ileocolonic
      region, thereby reducing systemic adverse effects. Immunosuppressants such as
      azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine, and also methotrexate in some cases, are used 
      for maintenance therapy of steroid-dependent and highly recurrent forms. These
      drugs stabilize the disease in about half the patients who receive them.
      Treatment typically lasts several years and necessitates regular monitoring,
      especially of hematological status. Cyclosporine is used intravenously in severe 
      HRC. Infliximab (RemicadeR), a chimeric monoclonal antibody targeting TNF is
      effective in acute forms and as maintenance therapy for CD. It was also recently 
      shown to be effective in HRC. Infliximab is indicated in steroid-resistant forms 
      and contraindicated in patients with latent systemic infections (tuberculosis,
      hepatitis B) and heart failure. Artificial nutrition is now only used in children
      with acute forms, in order to avoid the need for steroids. Probiotics might have 
      a place in maintenance treatment of HRC. Surgical treatment of HRC consists of
      colectomy or, more radically, ileoprotectomy followed by ileoanal anastomosis
      with resection: however, the likely benefits and potential complications
      (especially nocturnal diarrhea) must be carefully weighed up. Surgical treatment 
      of CD consists of resecting the worst-affected segments. As available medical and
      surgical treatments can only control these diseases, without curing them, patient
      management must be planned on a long-term basis. Control of exacerbations is
      judged on the basis of clinical parameters and biological markers of
      inflammation, rather than on lesion healing. The choice of maintenance therapy
      depends on the nature of the disease (HRC or CD) and its progressive nature.
      Surgery is reserved for patients with complicated and drug-resistant forms.

      disease.
PG  - 705-15
LID - 10.2146/ajhp070077 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Current and future treatment modalities for Clostridium
      difficile-associated disease (CDAD) are reviewed. SUMMARY: C. difficile, an
      anaerobic, spore-forming, gram-positive [corrected] rod, is the enteric pathogen 
      most frequently identified in patients with antibiotic-associated, nosocomially
      acquired diarrhea. Infection can lead to severe gastrointestinal illness which
      can develop into pseudomembranous colitis. Recent outbreaks in North America
      involved more virulent C. difficile strains, more severe infections, and more
      complicated treatment courses. Because of the potential for increased
      toxin-associated damage due to increased toxin exposure time, CDAD treatment
      often involves cessation of the inciting antibiotic, C. difficile-targeted
      antibiotic therapy, electrolyte normalization, fluid replacement, and
      antimotility agent avoidance. First-line therapy for CDAD is treatment with the
      antibiotic metronidazole. Vancomycin is often used in more severe cases and for
      treatment-resistant organisms. Treatment regimens may also include probiotics,
      bile-acid sequestrants, and, in limited cases, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).
      Alternative treatments for refractory and persistent CDAD include intracolonic
      vancomycin, nitazoxanide, rifaximin, IVIG, and probiotics. Several target
      proteins have been proposed for C. difficile vaccine production, including the
      flagellar cap protein FliD, flagellin FLiC, a cell wall protein (Cwp) (comprising
      amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains), a protease Cwp 84, and toxins A and B.
      Rarely, pseudomembranous colitis, a severe complication of CDAD, must be treated 
      through surgical intervention. CONCLUSION: CDAD is a major concern for health
      care systems and clinicians. New diagnostic tests with increased sensitivity for 
      detecting CDAD with a short turnaround time are necessary for early treatment and
      prevention. Continued research for more effective treatments and vaccine
      development for CDAD is also needed.

      patients with inflammatory bowel disease?

AB  - The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves an interaction
      between genetically determined host susceptibility, dysregulated immune response,
      and the enteric microbiota. Ecological treatments including probiotics,
      prebiotics, and synbiotics are actively studied in Crohn's disease (CD),
      ulcerative colitis (UC) and pouchitis. We review herein the literature on the
      rational use of probiotics in IBD considering efficacy (as evaluated in
      randomized controlled trials), mechanisms of action and safety issues. A
      probiotic effect is strictly restricted to one defined strain and cannot be
      generalized from one to another. There is evidence of efficacy of some probiotic 
      drugs in pouchitis (VSL#3), and in the prevention of recurrence of UC
      (Escherichia coli Nissle 1917). However, the evidence for efficacy of probiotic
      drugs in CD is still low as well as that of dietary ecological treatments.
      Despite an ecological (hopefully nutritional) treatment of IBD is promising, many
      questions remain unanswered and further clinical and fundamental studies are
      needed.

AB  - The normal colonic microflora is intimately involved in the aetiology of
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's
      disease (CD). These conditions are often refractile to conventional treatments
      involving the employment of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant drugs, and
      this has led to a search for alternative therapies based on the use of
      probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics. The majority of investigations in this
      area have been done with probiotics, and while there is increasing interest in
      the abilities of prebiotics and synbiotics to control the symptoms of IBD, very
      few randomised controlled trials have been reported. Although the results have
      been variable, human and animal studies have demonstrated that in many
      circumstances, these functional foods can alter the composition of the colonic
      microbiota, reduce inflammatory processes in the gut mucosa, and have the
      potential to induce disease remission. More work is needed to understand the
      effects of prebiotics and synbiotics on microbial communities in the gut, and
      their interactions with the host's immune system.

TI  - Microbial host interactions in IBD: implications for pathogenesis and therapy.
PG  - 497-507
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and pouchitis appear to be caused 
      by pathogenic T-cell responses to discrete antigens from the complex luminal
      microbiota, with susceptibility conferred by genetic polymorphisms that regulate 
      bacterial killing, mucosal barrier function, or immune responses. Environmental
      triggers initiate or reactivate inflammation and modulate genetic susceptibility.
      New pathogenesis concepts include defective bacterial killing by innate immune
      cells in CD, colonization of the ileum in CD with functionally abnormal
      Escherichia coli that adhere to and invade epithelial cells and resist bacterial 
      killing, and alterations in enteric microbiota composition in CD, UC, and
      pouchitis detected by molecular probes. The considerable therapeutic potential of
      manipulating the enteric microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease patients has
      not been realized, probably due to failure to recognize heterogenic disease
      mechanisms that require individualized use of antibiotics, probiotics,
      prebiotics, combination therapies, and genetically engineered bacteria to restore
      mucosal homeostasis.

TI  - VSL#3 probiotic upregulates intestinal mucosal alkaline sphingomyelinase and
      reduces inflammation.
PG  - 237-42
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alkaline sphingomyelinase, an enzyme found exclusively in bile and
      the intestinal brush border, hydrolyzes sphingomyelin into ceramide, sphingosine 
      and sphingosine-1-phosphate, thereby inducing epithelial apoptosis. Reduced
      levels of alkaline sphingomyelinase have been found in premalignant and malignant
      intestinal epithelia and in ulcerative colitis tissue. Probiotic bacteria can be 
      a source of sphingomyelinase. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of VSL#3
      probiotic therapy on mucosal levels of alkaline sphingomyelinase, both in a mouse
      model of colitis and in patients with ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Interleukin-10
      gene-deficient (IL10KO) and wild type control mice were treated with VSL#3 (10(9)
      colony-forming units per day) for three weeks, after which alkaline
      sphingomyelinase activity was measured in ileal and colonic tissue. As well, 15
      patients with ulcerative colitis were treated with VSL#3 (900 billion bacteria
      two times per day for five weeks). Alkaline sphingomyelinase activity was
      measured through biopsies and comparison of ulcerative colitis disease activity
      index scores obtained before and after treatment. RESULTS: Lowered alkaline
      sphingomyelinase levels were seen in the colon (P=0.02) and ileum (P=0.04) of
      IL10KO mice, as compared with controls. Treatment of these mice with VSL#3
      resulted in upregulation of mucosal alkaline sphingomyelinase activity in both
      the colon (P=0.04) and the ileum (P=0.01). VSL#3 treatment of human patients who 
      had ulcerative colitis decreased mean (+/- SEM) ulcerative colitis disease
      activity index scores from 5.3+/-1.8946 to 0.70+/-0.34 (P=0.02) and increased
      mucosal alkaline sphingomyelinase activity. CONCLUSION: Mucosal alkaline
      sphingomyelinase activity is reduced in the intestine of IL10KO mice with colitis
      and in humans with ulcerative colitis. VSL#3 probiotic therapy upregulates
      mucosal alkaline sphingomyelinase activity.

TI  - The effect of probiotics and organic acids on Shiga-toxin 2 gene expression in
      enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.
PG  - 125-32
LID - 10.1016/j.mimet.2008.01.014 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics are known to have an inhibitory effect against the growth of various
      foodborne pathogens, however, the specific role of probiotics in
      Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) virulence gene expression has not
      been well defined. Shiga toxins are members of a family of highly potent
      bacterial toxins and are the main virulence marker for STEC. Shiga toxins inhibit
      protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells and play a role in hemorrhagic colitis and 
      hemolytic uremic syndrome. STEC possesses Shiga toxin 1 (Stx1) and Shiga toxin 2 
      (Stx2), both of which have A and B subunits. Although STEC containing both Stx1
      and Stx2 has been isolated from patients with hemorrhagic colitis, Stx2 is more
      frequently associated with human disease complications. Thus, the effect of
      Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, and Bifidobacterium strains on stx2A expression
      levels in STEC was investigated. Lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria were
      isolated from farm animals, dairy, and human sources and included L. rhamnosus
      GG, L. curvatus, L. plantarum, L. jensenii, L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. reuteri,
      P. acidilactici, P. cerevisiae, P. pentosaceus, B. thermophilum, B. boum, B. suis
      and B. animalis. E. coli O157:H7 (EDL 933) was coincubated with sub-lethal
      concentrations of each probiotic strain. Following RNA extraction and cDNA
      synthesis, relative stx2A mRNA levels were determined according to a comparative 
      critical threshold (Ct) real-time PCR. Data were normalized to the endogenous
      control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and the level of stx2A
      expression between treated and untreated STEC was compared. Observed for all
      probiotic strains tested, stx2A was down-regulated, when compared to the control 
      culture. Probiotic production of organic acids, as demonstrated by a decrease in 
      pH, influenced stx2A gene expression.

TI  - Probiotics: sorting the evidence from the myths.
PG  - 304-8
AB  - Probiotics consist of yeast or bacteria, especially lactic acid bacteria. They
      are available as capsules, powder, fermented milks or yoghurts. Probiotics
      exhibit strain-specific differences in their resistance to acid and bile, ability
      to colonise the gastrointestinal tract, clinical efficacy, and benefits to the
      health of the host. There is level I evidence for the use of probiotics in
      treating acute infectious diarrhoea and preventing antibiotic-associated
      diarrhoea, with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Saccharomyces boulardii having the
      most evidence to support their use for these conditions. There is level II
      evidence that S. boulardii combined with high-dose vancomycin is more effective
      than the antibiotic alone in preventing recurrent Clostridium difficile
      diarrhoea. There is level I evidence that probiotics prevent traveller's
      diarrhoea. There is level I evidence for use of the high-potency probiotic VSL#3 
      in preventing pouchitis, and level II evidence for this agent in preventing
      relapse in patients with ulcerative colitis. Probiotics are generally regarded as
      safe and well tolerated. Some probiotics may be contraindicated in patients who
      are immunocompromised or have severe underlying illness, as they have been
      reported to cause fungaemia and bacteraemia.

AB  - We examined the in vitro and in vivo effects of a probiotic, Escherichia coli
      strain M-17 (EC-M17), on NF-kappaB signalling, cytokine secretion and efficacy in
      dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced murine colitis. NF-kappaB signalling was
      assessed using an NF-kappaB luciferase reporter cell line that was stimulated
      with TNF-alpha (100 ng/ml). p65 Nuclear binding and cytokine secretion
      (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6) were evaluated using a RAW 264.7 macrophage cell
      line that was exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 5 microg/ml). Mice were
      administered vehicle, EC-M17, metronidazole, or EC-M17 plus metronidazole for 13 
      d. During the final 6 d, mice also received 2 % DSS. Parameters evaluated
      included disease activity index (DAI), histology, myeloperoxidase and NF-kappaB
      p65. EC-M17 dose dependently inhibited TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB signalling. At
      5 x 109 colony-forming units/ml, EC-M17 inhibited NF-kappaB by >95 %. LPS-induced
      nuclear p65 binding was significantly inhibited (78 %; P 90 %) the LPS-induced
      secretion of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6. In mice with DSS-induced colitis,
      EC-M17, metronidazole, and EC-M17 plus metronidazole significantly reduced DAI
      and colonic histology scores. Both EC-M17 and metronidazole reduced colonic
      IL-12, IL-6, IL-1beta and interferon-gamma. The combination of EC-M17 plus
      metronidazole resulted in more substantial cytokine reductions than were found
      with either treatment alone, and combination therapy significantly (P < 0.05 in
      both cases) reduced IL-1beta compared with EC-M17 and colonic histology scores
      compared with metronidazole. Alone, and in combination with metronidazole, EC-M17
      improved murine colitis, probably due to an inhibitory effect on NF-kappaB
      signalling.

AB  - The intestinal microflora is a large bacterial community that colonizes the gut, 
      with a metabolic activity equal to an organ and various functions that affect the
      physiology and pathology of the host's mucosal immune system. Intestinal bacteria
      are useful in promotion of human health, but certain components of microflora, in
      genetically susceptible individuals, contribute to various pathological
      disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease. Clinical and experimental
      observations indicate an imbalance in protective and harmful microflora
      components in these disorders. Manipulation of gut flora to enhance its
      protective and beneficial role represents a promising field of new therapeutic
      strategies of inflammatory bowel disease. In this review, we discuss the
      implication of gut flora in the intestinal inflammation that justifies the role
      of probiotics and prebiotics in the prevention and treatment of inflammatory
      bowel disease and we address the evidence for therapeutic benefits from their use
      in experimental models of colitis and clinical trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intestinal microflora contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory 
      bowel disease, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. OBJECTIVE: This 
      review summarizes current clinical knowledge about the role of intestinal
      microflora in inflammatory bowel disease and their importance as targets for new 
      forms of therapy. METHODS: Recent knowledge on gut microbial ecology, role of
      microflora, and pattern recognition receptors is summarized in relation to
      inflammatory bowel disease. The results of in vitro experiments, in vivo animal
      studies and human clinical trials with the use of agents targeting microflora,
      including prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics, are described briefly.
      CONCLUSION: Altering the composition of intestinal microflora through prebiotics,
      probiotics and synbiotics may improve the clinical outcome of patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease.

PG  - CD004611
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD004611.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics are live microorganisms consisting of non-pathogenic yeast
      and bacteria that are believed to restore the microbial balance of the
      gastrointestinal tract altered by infection with Clostridium difficile (C.
      difficile). OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of probiotics in the treatment of 
      antibiotic associated C. difficile colitis. SEARCH STRATEGY: The databases
      MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane 
      IBD/FBD Specialized Trials register were searched to locate all published reports
      from 1966 to 2007. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized, prospective studies using
      probiotics alone or in conjunction with conventional antibiotics for the
      treatment of documented C. difficile colitis were eligible for inclusion. DATA
      COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data extraction and analysis was done independently by
      two authors. MAIN RESULTS: Four studies met the inclusion criteria and were
      included in the review. The four studies examined the use of probiotics in
      conjunction with conventional antibiotics (vancomycin or metronidazole) for the
      treatment of recurrence or an initial episode of C. difficile colitis in adults. 
      The studies were small in size and had methodological problems. A statistically
      significant benefit for probiotics combined with antibiotics was found in one
      study. McFarland 1994 found that patients receiving S. boulardii were
      significantly less likely than patients receiving placebo to experience
      recurrence of C. difficile diarrhea (RR 0.59; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.98). No benefit of
      probiotics treatment was found in the other studies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There 
      is insufficient evidence to recommend probiotic therapy as an adjunct to
      antibiotic therapy for C. difficile colitis. There is no evidence to support the 
      use of probiotics alone in the treatment of C. difficile colitis.

TI  - Probiotic administration in patients with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for
      ulcerative colitis is associated with expansion of mucosal regulatory cells.
PG  - 662-8
LID - 10.1002/ibd.20369 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics have anti-inflammatory effects in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease and appear to regulate mucosal immune response through
      reductions in proinflammatory cytokines. The probiotic VSL#3 prevents pouchitis
      if started within a week of ileostomy closure and maintains remission following
      antibacterial treatment in patients with refractory or recurrent pouchitis.
      However, the efficacy of probiotics and their effects on regulatory cells if
      started at a greater time after surgery in patients undergoing ileal pouch anal
      anastomosis (IPAA) for ulcerative colitis are unknown. METHODS: We conducted an
      open-label study in which 31 patients at different periods from surgery without
      signs and symptoms of pouchitis were randomized to 2 sachets of VSL#3 once daily 
      or no treatment for 12 months. Pouchitis disease activity index (PDAI) was
      evaluated at baseline and after 3, 6, and 12 months. The percentage of CD4+ T
      lymphocytes expressing CD25 and the inactive form of transforming growth
      factor-beta [latency-associated peptide (LAP)] were evaluated at baseline and
      after 3 and 6 months in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells and mucosal biopsies. 
      Variation in tissue interleukin-1beta and Foxp3 mRNA expression was also
      evaluated. RESULTS: During the study period, VSL#3-treated patients showed a
      significant reduction in PDAI score and a significant increase in the percentage 
      of mucosal CD4+CD25(high) and CD4+ LAP-positive cells compared with baseline
      values. Tissue samples at different points showed a significant reduction in
      IL-1beta mRNA expression, and a significant increase in Foxp3 mRNA expression.
      CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that VSL#3 administration in patients with IPAA
      modulates the PDAI and expands the number of mucosal regulatory T cells.

PG  - 1012-8
LID - 10.1002/ibd.20377 [doi]
AB  - The probiotic Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 is in addition to some
      Lactobacilli sp. one of the best-studied probiotic strains. This particular E.
      coli strain was isolated in 1917 based on its potential to protect from
      presumably infectious gastroenteritis. Initial therapeutic success was noted in
      the management of gastrointestinal infectious disorders and infections affecting 
      the urinary tract; the focus shifted later to chronic inflammatory conditions.
      The unique combination of fitness and survival factors to support intestinal
      survival, the lack of virulence, and obvious probiotic properties make this
      microorganism a safe and effective candidate in the treatment of chronic
      inflammatory bowel diseases. Three large clinical trials have assessed the
      potential in the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis and equivalence
      to standard 5-ASA medication was documented. This review aims to discuss
      important mechanisms of E. coli Nissle 1917 and will review the available
      literature regarding treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases.

PG  - 408-12
AB  - Surgery is required in the vast majority of patients with Crohn's disease (CD)
      and in approximately one-third of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Similar 
      to medical treatments for IBD, significant advances have occurred in surgery.
      Advances in CD include an emphasis upon conservatism as exemplified by more
      limited resections, strictureplasties, and laparoscopic resections. The use of
      probiotics in selected patients has improved the outcome in patients with
      pouchitis following restorative proctocolectomy for UC. It is anticipated that
      ongoing discoveries in the molecular basis of IBD will in turn identify those
      patients who will best respond to surgery.

TI  - Treatment of inflammatory bowel disease: a review of medical therapy.
PG  - 354-77
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic inflammatory
      diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. While a cure remains elusive, both can be
      treated with medications that induce and maintain remission. With the recent
      advent of therapies that inhibit tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha the overlap in
      medical therapies for UC and CD has become greater. Although 5-ASA agents have
      been a mainstay in the treatment of both CD and UC, the data for their efficacy
      in patients with CD, particularly as maintenance therapy, are equivocal.
      Antibiotics may have a limited role in the treatment of colonic CD. Steroids
      continue to be the first choice to treat active disease not responsive to other
      more conservative therapy; non-systemic steroids such as oral and rectal
      budesonide for ileal and right-sided CD and distal UC respectively are also
      effective in mild-moderate disease. 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and its prodrug
      azathioprine are steroid-sparing immunomodulators effective in the maintenance of
      remission of both CD and UC, while methotrexate may be used in both induction and
      maintenance of CD. Infliximab and adalimumab are anti-TNF agents approved in the 
      US and Europe for the treatment of Crohn's disease, and infliximab is also
      approved for the treatment of UC.

TI  - Review article: nitric oxide from dysbiotic bacterial respiration of nitrate in
      the pathogenesis and as a target for therapy of ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 531-41
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2008.03612.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Factors initiating human ulcerative colitis (UC) are unknown.
      Dysbiosis of bacteria has been hypothesized to initiate UC but, to date, neither 
      the nature of the dysbiosis nor mucosal breakdown has been explained. AIM: To
      assess whether a dysbiosis of anaerobic nitrate respiration could explain the
      microscopic, biochemical and functional changes observed in colonocytes of UC.
      METHODS: Published results in the gastroenterological, biochemical and
      microbiological literature were reviewed concerning colonocytes, nitrate
      respiration and nitric oxide in the colon in health and UC. A best-fit
      explanation of results was made regarding the pathogenesis and new treatments of 
      UC. RESULTS: Anaerobic nitrate respiration yields nitrite, nitric oxide (NO) and 
      nitrous oxide. Colonic bacteria produce NO and UC in remission has a higher
      lumenal NO level than control cases. NO with sulphide, but not NO alone, impairs 
      beta-oxidation, lipid and protein synthesis explaining the membrane, tight
      junctional and ion channel changes observed in colonocytes of UC. The
      observations complement therapeutic mechanisms of those probiotics, prebiotics
      and antibiotics useful in treating UC. CONCLUSIONS: The prolonged production of
      bacterial NO with sulphide can explain the initiation and barrier breakdown,
      which is central to the pathogenesis of UC. Therapies to alter bacterial nitrate 
      respiration and NO production need to evolve. The production of NO by colonic
      bacteria and that of the mucosa need to be separated to pinpoint the sequential
      nature of NO damage in UC.

PG  - S96-100; discussion S144-51
LID - 10.1086/523333 [doi]
AB  - Probiotic bacteria are used to treat or prevent a broad range of human diseases, 
      conditions, and syndromes. In addition, there are areas of medical use that have 
      been proposed for future probiotic applications. Randomized double-blind studies 
      have provided evidence of probiotic effectiveness for the treatment and
      prevention of acute diarrhea and antibiotic-induced diarrhea, as well as for the 
      prevention of cow milk-induced food allergy in infants and young children.
      Research studies have also provided evidence of effectiveness for the prevention 
      of traveler's diarrhea, relapsing Clostridium difficile-induced colitis, and
      urinary tract infections. There are also studies indicating that probiotics may
      be useful for prevention of respiratory infections in children, dental caries,
      irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease. Areas of future
      interest for the application of probiotics include colon and bladder cancers,
      diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis. The probiotics with the greatest number of
      proven benefits are Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG and Saccharomyces
      boulardii.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics, defined as live micro-organisms with beneficial effects
      for the host, are widely applied in gastrointestinal and liver diseases. AIM AND 
      METHOD: To review the available evidence of clinical trials on probiotics in
      gastrointestinal and liver diseases, with a major focus on irritable bowel
      syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis and chronic liver diseases.
      RESULTS: Evidence for the therapeutic or preventive application of particular
      probiotic strains is available for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea,
      rota-virus-associated diarrhoea and pouchitis. Results are encouraging for
      irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis and for reducing side effects by
      Helicobacter pylori eradication therapies, but are less clear for Crohn's
      disease, lactose intolerance and constipation. In general, for most of these
      patient groups, more placebo-controlled methodologically well-designed studies
      that pay attention to both clinical outcome and mechanistic aspects are required.
      The application in liver disease and pancreatitis is promising, but more human
      trials have to be awaited. Possible mechanisms of probiotics include modulation
      of the intestinal microbiota and the immune system, but different bacterial may
      have different effects. CONCLUSION: Further insight into disease entities and the
      functioning of probiotic strains is required to be able to select
      disease-specific strains, which have to be tested in well-designed
      placebo-controlled studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: The incidence and therefore complications of (sigmoid)
      diverticular disease are increasing. METHODS: Review of current literature.
      RESULTS: From all patients, 15% will develop diverticulitis, 5% complications and
      5% diverticular bleeding. Diagnosis is established with computerised tomography. 
      Colonoscopy is needed to rule out malignancy. NSAIDs increase the risk of
      perforation; steroids, diabetes, collagen vascular disease and immune compromised
      are associated with complicated disease and death. In mild diverticulitis,
      antibiotics are recommended. In complicated disease with abscesses, <5 cm
      antibiotics are sufficient. Larger abscesses are drained under computerised
      tomography-guidance. Peritonitis forms an indication for surgery. Diverticulitis 
      recurrence rate is around 30%, most are uncomplicated. Recurrence after surgery
      is around 10%. Elective surgery is reserved for fistula closure and obstruction. 
      The need for elective surgery to prevent recurrence has diminished because of new
      insights. Important is to identify risk groups. New issues are the possible
      relationship between diverticulitis and cancer, segmental colitis associated with
      diverticulitis, and treatment of diverticulitis with mesalazine and probiotics.
      CONCLUSIONS: Uncomplicated diverticulitis is treated medically. Complicated
      diverticulitis with small abscesses is treated with antibiotics while larger
      abscesses are drained with computerised tomography-guided puncture. Emergency
      surgery is reserved for peritonitis, elective surgery for fistula/stenosis.
      Surgery to prevent recurrence is indicated only in selected cases (e.g. immune
      compromised).

TI  - The use of a nursing model to understand diarrhea and the role of probiotics in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 418-23; quiz 424-5
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease, an umbrella term used for Crohn disease and
      ulcerative colitis, is often accompanied with the presenting symptom of diarrhea.
      This symptom can be a great nuisance and emotionally distressing to the
      individual with inflammatory bowel disease. Although the exact etiology of
      inflammatory bowel disease is still unknown, interactions between the host
      susceptibility, mucosal immunity, and intestinal microflora are thought to be
      major factors. One intervention that is gaining increasing support by the
      research and medical community is the use of probiotics, which work on the
      intestinal flora by altering the bacterial composition and thereby rendering the 
      environment unfavorable to pathogenic organisms. The human response to illness
      model provides an ideal organizing framework to gain a comprehensive
      understanding of the human response of diarrhea in the inflammatory bowel disease
      population. By examining the physiological, pathophysiological, behavioral, and
      experiential perspectives as well as individual vulnerabilities, this model
      establishes sound rationale to guide nursing interventions to help the individual
      better cope with the physical and emotional effects of having diarrhea. This
      model also facilitates the provision of holistic and personalized care, which may
      include the use of probiotics to help alleviate this distressing symptom.

TI  - Probiotics and remission of ulcerative colitis: a systematic review.
PG  - 411-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an acute and inflammatory disease of the
      large bowel of unknown aetiology. The use of probiotics for this disease remains 
      controversial. The objective of this systematic review was to identify studies
      based on randomised controlled trials comparing the effect of probiotics to the
      effect of anti-inflammatory drugs or placebo in the remission of UC. METHODS: We 
      conducted a systematic review of clinical trials comparing the effect of
      probiotics to the effect of anti-inflammatory treatment or placebo in the
      remission of UC. PubMed, scienceDirect, Cochrane, Google scholar, metaRegister of
      Controlled Trials and National Institutes of Health were searched. RESULTS: Nine 
      studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies present a significant
      heterogeneity concerning their methodology and their results. The improvement in 
      UC remission and the frequency of adverse effects do not differ significantly
      between probiotic and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: There are a limited number of 
      randomised trials published in the field of probiotics used for the remission of 
      UC, and they present many methodological differences. The existing studies
      suggest a similar safety and efficacy of probiotics in comparison with
      anti-inflammatory drugs.

TI  - Lactobacillus fermentum ACA-DC 179 displays probiotic potential in vitro and
      protects against trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis and
      Salmonella infection in murine models.
PG  - 18-26
AB  - Lactobacillus fermentum ACA-DC 179, Lactobacillus plantarum ACA-DC 287 and
      Streptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC 198 were studied for their probiotic potential. 
      Firstly, strains were screened for antimicrobial activity towards a broad range
      of target strains, including lactic acid bacteria, food spoilage and pathogenic
      bacteria. L. fermentum ACA-DC 179 was active against five streptococci, including
      the two pathogenic strains Streptococcus oralis LMG 14532T and Streptococcus
      pneumoniae LMG 14545T. S. macedonicus ACA-DC 198 was active against the majority 
      of the strains tested, including not only lactic acid bacteria but also many food
      spoilage or pathogenic species. The three potential probiotic strains were found 
      to survive variably at pH 2.5 and were unaffected by bile salts. Only S.
      macedonicus ACA-DC 198 exhibited bile salt hydrolase activity, while none of the 
      strains was haemolytic. Moreover, strains exhibited variable susceptibility
      towards commonly used antibiotics. L. plantarum ACA-DC 287 and S. macedonicus
      ACA-DC 198 induced the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-12,
      IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Also
      elevated levels of the anti-inflammatory IL-10 were observed with L. fermentum
      ACA-DC 179. This strain consequently was found to significantly reduce colitis in
      a TNBS-induced colitis mouse model. Furthermore, L. fermentum ACA-DC 179 was
      successfully applied in an experimental Salmonella-infection mouse model. To
      conclude, strain L. fermentum ACA-DC 179 possesses desirable probiotic
      properties, such as antimicrobial activity and immunomodulation in vitro, which
      were confirmed in vivo by the use of animal models.

TI  - Prebiotics in inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - S85-9
AB  - In genetically susceptible individuals, an altered mucosal immune response
      against some commensal bacteria of the gut ecosystem appears to be the principal 
      mechanism leading to intestinal lesions in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The 
      information currently available does not provide an exact explanation about the
      origin of this important dysfunction of the interaction between host and
      commensal bacteria, but an altered microbial composition has been detected in the
      gut ecosystem of patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Prebiotics 
      are food ingredients not digested nor absorbed in the upper intestinal tract that
      are fermented by intestinal bacteria in a selective way promoting changes in the 
      gut ecosystem. Experimental and human studies have shown that inulin and
      oligofructose stimulate saccharolysis in the colonic lumen and favour the growth 
      of indigenous lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. These effects are associated with 
      reduced mucosal inflammation in animal models of IBD. Strong experimental
      evidence supports the hypothesis that inulin and oligofructose can offer an
      opportunity to prevent or mitigate intestinal inflammatory lesions in human
      Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis. Encouraging results have been
      obtained in preliminary clinical trials.

TI  - Probiotics in the management of colonic disorders.
PG  - 434-40
AB  - Probiotics have been used in humans for almost a century and widely recommended
      for the treatment of a variety of ills assumed to be of colonic origin, including
      diarrhea, constipation, bloating, and flatulence. More recently, probiotics have 
      been evaluated in the management of specific colonic disorders such as
      inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and Clostridium difficile
      colitis. It is evident that no two probiotics are exactly alike; why then should 
      we expect reproducible results from studies that employ different species or
      strains, variable formulations, and diverse dosing schedules? When probiotics
      have been studied with the rigor appropriate to a new therapeutic modality, some 
      coherent results have emerged: specific strains are effective in certain
      diarrheal states, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis, as
      well as in the prevention of C. difficile-related colitis. Even here, not to
      mention other colonic disorders, further adequately powered and appropriately
      designed trials are needed.

TI  - [The role of translational research in inflammatory bowel disease].
PG  - 146-53
AB  - The idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases, broadly classified as either Crohn's 
      disease or ulcerative colitis, are caused by a dysregulated mucosal immune
      response to a luminal antigen, possibly a bacterium, in a genetically predisposed
      host. A rapid expansion of knowledge in recent years has greatly increased our
      understanding of the pathophysiology of these disorders. For example, the
      relatively recent discovery of the NOD2 gene, a protein involved in bacterial
      sensing, has provided further evidence of the complex interplay between hosts and
      microbes in Crohn's disease. Significant recent advances have also occurred with 
      the discovery of the role of Toll-like receptors and dendritic cells in the
      development of gut inflammation, and the role of proinflammatory cytokines in the
      development and potentiation of gut inflammation. This article presents an update
      on these key developments and emphasizes the translational aspects of research
      that are directly related to patient care.

PG  - 2572S-2575S
LID - 10.1093/jn/137.11.2572S [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, also called chronic inflammatory bowel
      diseases (IBD), affect up to 500 per 100,000 persons in the Western world. Recent
      studies in the etiology of IBD suggest that these diseases are caused by a
      combination of genetic, environmental, and immunological factors. Results from
      humans and especially animal models of colitis reported by our group and others
      have indicated that these diseases result from a lack of tolerance to resident
      intestinal bacteria in genetically susceptible hosts. Probiotic bacteria have
      health-promoting effects for the host when ingested and have also shown efficacy 
      in ulcerative colitis and refractory pouchitis. In light of the efficacy of
      providing probiotic bacteria to patients with IBD, there has been interest in the
      prophylactic and therapeutic potential of inulin, oligofructose, and other
      prebiotics for patients with or at risk of IBD. Prebiotics are nondigestible
      dietary oligosaccharides that affect the host by selectively stimulating growth, 
      activity, or both of selective intestinal (probiotic) bacteria. Prebiotics are
      easy to administer and, in contrast to probiotic therapy, do not require
      administration of large amounts of (live) bacteria and are therefore easier to
      administer. Studies using prebiotics, especially beta-fructan oligosaccharides,
      for the treatment of chronic intestinal inflammation have shown benefit in animal
      models of colitis. Studies using these prebiotics alone or in combination with
      probiotics are emerging and have shown promise. These dietary therapies could
      lead to novel treatments for these chronic debilitating diseases.

TI  - Probiotics for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - CD005573
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is an inflammatory condition affecting the
      colon with an incidence of approximately 10-20 per 100,000 per year. No existing 
      intervention is effective in all patients with a proportion requiring colectomy. 
      There are significant proportion of patients who experience adverse effects with 
      current therapies. Consequently, new alternatives for the treatment of UC are
      constantly being sought. Probiotics are live microbial feed supplements that may 
      beneficially affect the host by improving intestinal microbial balance, enhancing
      gut barrier function and improving local immune response. OBJECTIVES: To assess
      the efficacy of probiotics compared with placebo or standard medical treatment
      (5-aminosalicylates, sulfasalazine or corticosteroids) for the induction of
      remission in active ulcerative colitis. SEARCH STRATEGY: A comprehensive search
      for relevant randomised controlled trials (RCT's) was carried out using MEDLINE
      (1966-January 2006), EMBASE (January 1985- 2006) and CENTRAL. The Cochrane
      IBD/FBD Review Group Specialised Trials Registrar was also searched. The
      Australasian Medical Index, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Latin
      American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), and the Japan Information
      Centre of Science and Technology File on Science, Technology and Medicine
      (JICST-E) were also used to identify abstracts. Conference proceedings from the
      Falk Symposium, Digestive Disease Week (DDW) and the United European Digestive
      Disease week were hand-searched. Authors of relevant studies and drug companies
      were contacted regarding ongoing or unpublished trials that may be relevant to
      the review. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials investigating the
      effectiveness of probiotics compared to standard treatments in the induction of
      remission of active ulcerative colitis DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors 
      independently assessed trial quality and extracted data for analysis. Data were
      analysed using RevMan 4.2.7. A formal meta-analysis was not preformed due to
      differences in probiotics, outcomes and trial methodology. MAIN RESULTS: None of 
      the included studies reported any statistically significant differences in
      remission or clinical improvement rates between probiotic and placebo or active
      comparator groups. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Conventional therapy combined with a
      probiotic does not improve overall remission rates in patients with mild to
      moderate ulcerative colitis. However, there is limited evidence that probiotics
      added to standard therapy may provide modest benefits in terms of reduction of
      disease activity in patients with mild to moderately severe ulcerative colitis.
      Whether probiotics are as effective in patients with severe and more extensive
      disease and whether they can be used as an alternative to existing therapies is
      unknown. Further well designed, larger randomised controlled trials are needed to
      determine whether probiotics can be used as an alternative to current treatment
      modalities.

TI  - High-dose probiotics for the treatment of active pouchitis.
PG  - 2075-82; discussion 2082-4
AB  - PURPOSE: Pouchitis is the major long-term complication after ileal-pouch anal
      anastomosis for ulcerative colitis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are the mainstay
      of treatment in this condition. Recently, we have shown the efficacy of a highly 
      concentrated probiotic preparation (VSL#3, 900 billions/sachet lyophilized viable
      bacteria) in preventing relapses of chronic pouchitis and in preventing pouchitis
      onset. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of high-dose VSL#3 in the
      treatment of mildly active pouchitis. METHODS: Twenty-three consecutive patients 
      with mild pouchitis, defined as a score of between 7 and 12 in the Pouchitis
      Disease Activity Index, which includes clinical, endoscopic, and histological
      criteria, were treated with VSL#3, 2 sachets b.i.d. (3,600 billion bacteria/day) 
      for four weeks. Symptomatic, endoscopic, and histologic evaluations were
      undertaken before and after treatment according to Pouchitis Disease Activity
      Index. Remission was defined as a combination of a Pouchitis Disease Activity
      Index clinical score of <or=2, endoscopic score of <or=1, and total Pouchitis
      Disease Activity Index score of <or=4. Patients in remission after treatment were
      treated with VSL#3, 1 sachet b.i.d. (1,800 billion bacteria), as maintenance
      treatment for six months. The quality of life was assessed with the Inflammatory 
      Bowel Disease Questionnaire. RESULTS: Sixteen of 23 patients (69 percent) were in
      remission after treatment. The median total Pouchitis Disease Activity Index
      scores before and after therapy were 10 (range, 9-12) and 4 (range, 2-11),
      respectively (P < 0.01). The median Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire
      score also significantly improved from 110 (range, 90-140) to 200 (range, 95-220;
      P < 0.001). All 16 patients who went into remission maintained remission during
      maintenance treatment. Only one patient experienced a transient bloating at the
      beginning of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: High doses of the probiotic VSL#3 are
      effective in the treatment of mild pouchitis. Further controlled studies are
      warranted.

TI  - Drug therapy for inflammatory bowel disease in pregnancy and the puerperium.
PG  - 835-47
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has a peak age of onset in the 3rd decade and a 
      peak prevalent age in the fourth decade in most studies. As a result many
      patients affected by Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are females of
      reproductive age interested in bearing children. It has been shown that the most 
      important factor in the success of a pregnancy in patients with IBD is the state 
      of disease activity. Therefore, the goal prior to and during pregnancy is to best
      optimise control of the disease through medical therapy. Unfortunately, many
      medications utilised to treat IBD are potentially toxic and/or teratogenic,
      leaving many physicians and patients without a clear answer as to the safest
      methods of therapy. This review attempts to summarise the medical literature to
      date, as it pertains to the safety of medical therapy for IBD during pregnancy
      and the puerperium.

AB  - A 11-years old cyclosporin-treated girl with nephrotic syndrome, complicated by
      severe toxic diarrhoea with excessive metabolic alkalosis and dyselektrolitemia
      (hyponatremia, hypokaliemia, hypochloremia) and transient immunoglobulin
      deficiency is reported. Ultrasonography shows thickeness of the colonic wall as a
      symptom of colonic inflammation. After discontinuation of cyclosporin therapy,
      excluding infectious origin of diarrhoea (bacterial, viral and fungal infection),
      partial parenteral nutrition, enteral nutrition (Peptisorb), probiotics and
      antidiarrhoeal drugs were used in the treatment. After introducing steroids
      orally (Entocort) complete resolution of symptoms were observed.

TI  - Clinical effectiveness of probiotics therapy (BIO-THREE) in patients with
      ulcerative colitis refractory to conventional therapy.
PG  - 1306-11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Intestinal microflora has been implicated in the etiology of
      ulcerative colitis (UC). Over the past few years, the use of probiotics in UC has
      gained attention. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of
      probiotics therapy for mild to moderate distal UC refractory to conventional
      therapies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty patients with mild to moderate distal UC 
      took 9 BIO-THREE tablets per day for 4 weeks. Clinical symptoms and endoscopic
      findings were evaluated as ulcerative colitis disease activity index (UCDAI)
      scores before and after administration of BIO-THREE. Fecal samples were collected
      from all patients before and after probiotics administration, and fecal
      microflora was analyzed by the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism 
      (T-RFLP) method. RESULTS: Remission (UCDAI score < or =2) was observed in 45%
      (9/20) of the patients; response (decrease in UCDAI > or = 3, but final score >
      or = 3) in 10% (2/20); no response in 40% (8/20); and worsening (UCDAI > 3) in 5%
      (1/20). T-RFLP analysis indicated that the principal alteration in microflora was
      an increase in bifidobacteria. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that administration
      of BIO-THREE improved the clinical symptoms and endoscopic findings in patients
      with UC, indicating that administration of BIO-THREE is safe and efficacious for 
      the treatment of UC.

TI  - Prescript-assist probiotic-prebiotic treatment for irritable bowel syndrome: an
      open-label, partially controlled, 1-year extension of a previously published
      controlled clinical trial.
PG  - 1153-60
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to extend a previous 2-week assessment of a 
      probiotic-prebiotic complex in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
      METHODS: In this open-label, partially controlled, 1-year (14 [2] months)
      extension study, data were collected from patients with IBS who continued
      treatment following a 2-week study of the efficacy of the probiotic-prebiotic
      complex. Data were collected at 2 and approximately 60 weeks after the end of the
      original study. RESULTS: A total of 25 patients entered the 2-week extension and 
      22 completed the approximately 60-week follow-up study (20 women, 2 men; age
      range, 20-70 years; all white). Results in the control group 2 weeks after
      crossover to treatment were similar to those from the original study, with
      reductions in IBS subsyndromes, as follows: general ill feelings/nausea (P <
      0.001), indigestion/flatulence (P < 0.001), and marginally colitis (P < 0.03
      [1-tailed]). Treatment was associated with a continued reduction in general ill
      feelings/nausea at 4 weeks (P < 0.007). At >or=52-week follow-up, the rate of
      remissions was 81.5% to 100% (P < 0.003). CONCLUSION: Based on the results from
      the present 1-year extension study, treatment with this probiotic-prebiotic
      complex may be an option for short-term (2-4 weeks) and long-term ( approximately
      60-week) reductions in IBS symptoms.

TI  - [Colectomy management].
PG  - 135-44
AB  - Colorectal surgery is one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures on
      the gastrointestinal tract. The large bowel plays an important role in
      maintaining water and electrolyte balance due to its high capacity of water
      absorption that may be altered with surgery. Artificial nutritional support
      should be administered, whenever possible, and is well managed with through the
      enteral route. PN is indicated only at post-surgery when there are major
      complications associated with intestinal failure. Early post-surgery EN, or oral 
      supplements, seems to be beneficial. Pouchitis occurs after proctocolectomy with 
      ileoanal anastomosis with the creation of a reservoir in patients with ulcerative
      colitis, and is well managed with antibiotic therapy, steroids, and probiotics.
      The implementation of a specific nutritional support protocol allows for
      decreasing PN and shortens hospital stay.

TI  - [Probiotics and prebiotics in clinical practice].
PG  - 26-34
AB  - This article revises the concepts of prebiotics, probiotics and symbiotics, and
      their use in different situations of daily clinical practice. With a high level
      of evidence, it is concluded that the use of certain strains of probiotics
      significantly reduces the risk for antibiotic-induced diarrhea. Although further 
      studies are needed, the use of probiotics, prebiotics, and symbiotics in people
      suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (particularly ulcerative colitis, and
      pouchitis) might improve the rates of remission induction/maintenance. The
      administration of probiotics and symbiotics to patients with liver transplant,
      severe acute pancreatitis, and intensive and surgical care patients, emerges as a
      promising therapeutic option that seems to reduce the number of infections;
      however, it is currently no possible to establish evidence-based recommendations,
      with a need for a higher number of better designed works. About safety of
      probiotics and symbiotics, the benefits/risks ratio clearly favors the former
      since the risk for infection is low, even in immunosuppressed patients. There
      are, however, selected groups of patients in which caution is advised.

TI  - Functional fermented milk products.
PG  - 235-47; discussion 247-50
AB  - Fermented foods have been used since prehistoric times. Their number, variety and
      geographic origin are considerable, and different substrates and agents including
      bacteria, yeasts and moulds have been used in their preparation. In the last few 
      decades the scientific approach to the study of the participating microorganisms 
      and the resulting products have provided a better understanding of their
      biological importance. Among the many health-related properties of fermented
      foods, effects on blood pressure have been described after casein hydrolysis by
      lactic acid bacteria. Peptides with antimicrobial activity, mainly against
      Gram-negative bacteria, and derived from casein have also been identified. This
      could explain, at least in part, the antidiarrheal effects of fermented products 
      including those on traveler's diarrhea and against colonization by Helicobacter
      pylori. One of the best known advantages of fermented milk products is their
      capacity to improve lactose tolerance in hypolactasic subjects. With the growing 
      prevalence of allergies and inflammatory bowel diseases, considerable interest
      has been focused on the effects of lactic acid bacteria in these conditions;
      there is evidence that these agents are associated with improvements in allergy; 
      no such evidence exists for Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. A
      cholesterol-lowering capacity has also been described for some microorganisms.
      Not all the fermenting microorganisms have probiotic capacities as the latter are
      strain-specific.

TI  - Evidence for the use of probiotics and prebiotics in inflammatory bowel disease: 
      a review of clinical trials.
PG  - 307-15
AB  - Human subjects and their enteric microbiota have evolved together to reach a
      state of mutual tolerance. Mounting evidence from both animal models and human
      studies suggests that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents a malfunction
      of this relationship. The enteric microecology therefore represents an attractive
      therapeutic target with few side effects. Probiotics and prebiotics have been
      investigated in clinical trials as treatments for IBD, with conflicting results. 
      The evidence for the use of probiotics in the management of pouchitis is
      persuasive and several studies indicate their effectiveness in ulcerative
      colitis. Trials of probiotics and prebiotics in Crohn's disease are less
      convincing. However, methodologies vary widely and a range of probiotic,
      prebiotic and combination (synbiotic) treatments have been tested in a variety of
      patient groups with an assortment of end points. Conclusions about any one
      treatment in a specific patient group can therefore only be drawn on evidence
      from relatively small numbers of patients. The present article reviews the role
      of the intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBD and addresses the
      clinical evidence for the therapeutic manipulation of bowel microbiota using
      probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics in IBD.

TI  - Probiotics for Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea: focus on Lactobacillus 
      rhamnosus GG and Saccharomyces boulardii.
PG  - 1212-21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on the use of probiotics to treat or prevent 
      recurrences of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) by replacing
      normal gastric flora. DATA SOURCES: PubMed (1970-March 2007) was searched using
      the terms probiotics, Clostridium difficile, colitis, diarrhea, prevention, and
      treatment. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Case reports, case series, and
      clinical trials describing the use of probiotics in the treatment or prevention
      of recurrences of CDAD as primary outcome were included. DATA SYNTHESIS: A
      variety of controlled trials, case series, and case reports have evaluated
      probiotics to treat first or recurrent episodes of CDAD. In addition, a
      meta-analysis has been conducted to try to determine the role of probiotics in
      CDAD. In general, most case series and case reports have shown favorable results 
      with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG or Saccharomyces boulardii. However, other
      reports have shown lack of benefit. The meta-analysis showed that these
      probiotics may be useful in treating or preventing recurrences of CDAD.
      Nonetheless, the heterogeneity of the studies makes definite conclusions
      difficult. In addition, several cases of bacteremia or fungemia associated with
      probiotic use have been reported, particularly in the last decade. Patients most 
      commonly affected by these complications are immunosuppressed. Unfortunately,
      these are also the patients more likely to have severe CDAD or are at risk for
      recurrences. CONCLUSIONS: Additional experience with and study of probiotics are 
      warranted due to numerous unanswered questions. Given the potential for
      complications in debilitated and immunosuppressed patients, the risks may
      outweigh benefits, and rational antibiotic use may be a better option to prevent 
      a first episode or recurrence of CDAD.

TI  - Anti-inflammatory effects of probiotic yogurt in inflammatory bowel disease
      patients.
PG  - 470-9
AB  - Our aim was to assess anti-inflammatory effects on the peripheral blood of
      subjects with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who consumed probiotic yogurt for 
      1 month. We studied 20 healthy controls and 20 subjects with IBD, 15 of whom had 
      Crohn's disease and five with ulcerative colitis. All the subjects consumed
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and L. reuteri RC-14 supplemented yogurt for 30
      days. The presence of putative regulatory T (T(reg)) cells (CD4(+) CD25(high))
      and cytokines in T cells, monocytes and dendritic cells (DC) was determined by
      flow cytometry from peripheral blood before and after treatment, with or without 
      ex vivo stimulation. Serum and faecal cytokine concentrations were determined by 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The proportion of CD4(+) CD25(high) T cells
      increased significantly (P = 0.007) in IBD patients, mean (95% confidence
      interval: CI) 0.84% (95% CI 0.55-1.12) before and 1.25% (95% CI 0.97-1.54) after 
      treatment, but non-significantly in controls. The basal proportion of tumour
      necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha(+)/interleukin (IL)-12(+) monocytes and myeloid DC
      decreased in both subject groups, but of stimulated cells only in IBD patients.
      Also serum IL-12 concentrations and proportions of IL-2(+) and CD69(+) T cells
      from stimulated cells decreased in IBD patients. The increase in CD4(+)
      CD25(high) T cells correlated with the decrease in the percentage of TNF-alpha-
      or IL-12-producing monocytes and DC. The effect of the probiotic yogurt was
      confirmed by a follow-up study in which subjects consumed the yogurt without the 
      probiotic organisms. Probiotic yogurt intake was associated with significant
      anti-inflammatory effects that paralleled the expansion of peripheral pool of
      putative T(reg) cells in IBD patients and with few effects in controls.

TI  - Novel and future medical management of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 727-41
AB  - The treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is undergoing rapid and
      profound change. Entirely new approaches are being developed that reflect a
      greater understanding of how to control the inflammatory process. These began
      with inflixumab therapy for Crohn's disease. Additional tumor necrosis antibodies
      will soon be employed, and other biological agents are being investigated.
      Probiotics, helminth ova therapy, alternative and complementary treatments,
      leukocytophoresis, and bone-marrow and stem-cell transplantation are additional
      exciting regimens that are being explored. Although some of these approaches
      provide marked improvement in these parameters, others are unproven or fraught
      with adverse effects and complications. Still, control of ulcerative colitis and 
      Crohn's is improving with more changes likely to come.

TI  - Characteristic of milk whey culture with Propionibacterium freudenreichii ET-3
      and its application to the inflammatory bowel disease therapy.
PG  - 105-8
AB  - After the screening of microorganism culture, the culture of Propionibacterium
      freudenreichii ET-3 in the milk whey (milk whey culture) was found to stimulate
      the growth of our own Bifidobacteria in the colon but not the growth of other
      microorganisms. One of the active substances was identified as
      1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (DHNA).In healthy volunteers, the ingestion
      containing milk whey culture significantly increased the population of
      Bifidobacteria to total fecal bacterium. In the TNBS-induced colitis model of
      rats, milk whey culture significantly accelerated the healing of the colitis in a
      dose-dependent manner. It has been reported that DHNA inhibited the lymphocyte
      infiltration through reduction of MAdCAM-1 in DSS colitis model of mice and that 
      the ingestion of milk whey culture was effective in the treatment of ulcerative
      colitis in human pilot study. These findings suggest that milk whey culture is a 
      useful prebiotic for the therapy of inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease: clinical aspects and established and evolving
      therapies.
PG  - 1641-57
AB  - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are two idiopathic inflammatory bowel
      disorders. In this paper we discuss the current diagnostic approach, their
      pathology, natural course, and common complications, the assessment of disease
      activity, extraintestinal manifestations, and medical and surgical management,
      and provide diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms. We critically review the
      evidence for established (5-aminosalicylic acid compounds, corticosteroids,
      immunomodulators, calcineurin inhibitors) and emerging novel therapies--including
      biological therapies--directed at cytokines (eg, infliximab, adalimumab,
      certolizumab pegol) and receptors (eg, visilizumab, abatacept) involved in T-cell
      activation, selective adhesion molecule blockers (eg, natalizumab, MLN-02,
      alicaforsen), anti-inflammatory cytokines (eg, interleukin 10), modulation of the
      intestinal flora (eg, antibiotics, prebiotics, probiotics), leucocyte apheresis
      and many more monoclonal antibodies, small molecules, recombinant growth factors,
      and MAP kinase inhibitors targeting various inflammatory cells and pathways.
      Finally, we summarise the practical aspects of standard therapies including
      dosing, precautions, and side-effects.

TI  - Probiotics affect virulence-related gene expression in Escherichia coli O157:H7.
PG  - 4259-67
AB  - The attachment of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 (EHEC O157) to host 
      intestinal epithelial cells is essential for the development of hemorrhagic
      colitis and hemolytic-uremic syndrome in humans. Genes involved in attachment are
      carried within a pathogenicity island named the locus of enterocyte effacement
      (LEE), known to be directly activated by quorum sensing (QS). In the present
      study, we investigated autoinducer-2 (AI-2) production and the expression of
      several virulence-related genes in EHEC O157 grown in the absence and presence of
      a Lactobacillus acidophilus-secreted molecule(s). Transcription of important EHEC
      O157 virulence-related genes was studied by constructing promoter-reporter
      fusions and reverse transcriptase PCR. Shiga toxin (Stx) production was assayed
      by an enzyme immunoassay. When EHEC O157 was grown in the presence of
      chromatographically selected fractions of L. acidophilus La-5 cell-free spent
      medium, we observed a significant reduction of both extracellular AI-2
      concentration and the expression of important virulence-related genes, although
      no significant difference in Stx production was observed. We show here that L.
      acidophilus La-5 secretes a molecule(s) that either acts as a QS signal inhibitor
      or directly interacts with bacterial transcriptional regulators, controlling the 
      transcription of EHEC O157 genes involved in colonization.

TI  - [Irritable bowel syndrome: current treatment options].
PG  - 1619-26
AB  - Relieving abdominal pain is the principal treatment objective for patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome. No single drug stands out in the treatment strategy for
      this illness. Antispasmodics, magnesium aluminum silicates, and alverine citrate 
      drugs all remain initial options for treatment, although their prescription is
      impeded by the fact that an increasing number are no longer approved for
      reimbursement. Increased dietary fibers often have a harmful effect on symptoms. 
      Some patients are probably intolerant to some foods but there is no satisfactory 
      proof on which to base a restrictive diet. Improved knowledge of the
      pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome has made it possible to diversify
      treatments that act first on one of the key pathophysiologic elements, visceral
      hypersensitivity. Antidepressants (especially tricyclics) can be used at low
      doses. Among the serotonergic drugs, serotonin 5-HT4 receptors agonists
      (tegaserod) may be available soon, but the development of 5-HT3 antagonists
      (alosetron, cilansetron) has been stopped for safety reasons (ischemic colitis
      and severe constipation). Non-drug options such as hypnosis, psychotherapy,
      relaxation, or yoga, may also be proposed to some patients. Probiotics are a
      possible treatment in the future.

TI  - Identification of commensal bacterial strains that modulate Yersinia
      enterocolitica and dextran sodium sulfate-induced inflammatory responses:
      implications for the development of probiotics.
PG  - 3490-7
AB  - An increasing body of evidence suggests that probiotic bacteria are effective in 
      the treatment of enteric infections, although the molecular basis of this
      activity remains elusive. To identify putative probiotics, we tested commensal
      bacteria in terms of their toxicity, invasiveness, inhibition of Yersinia-induced
      inflammation in vitro and in vivo, and modulation of dextran sodium sulfate
      (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. The commensal bacteria Escherichia coli,
      Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteroides distasonis, and
      Streptococcus salivarius were screened for adhesion to, invasion of, and toxicity
      for host epithelial cells (EC), and the strains were tested for their ability to 
      inhibit Y. enterocolitica-induced NF-kappaB activation. Additionally, B.
      adolescentis was administered to mice orally infected with Y. enterocolitica and 
      to mice with mucosae impaired by DSS treatment. None of the commensal bacteria
      tested was toxic for or invaded the EC. B. adolescentis, B. distasonis, B.
      vulgatus, and S. salivarius inhibited the Y. enterocolitica-induced NF-kappaB
      activation and interleukin-8 production in EC. In line with these findings, B.
      adolescentis-fed mice had significantly lower results for mean pathogen burden in
      the visceral organs, intestinal tumor necrosis factor alpha mRNA expression, and 
      loss of body weight upon oral infection with Y. enterocolitica. In addition, the 
      administration of B. adolescentis decelerated inflammation upon DSS treatment in 
      mice. We suggest that our approach might help to identify new probiotics to be
      used for the treatment of inflammatory and infectious gastrointestinal disorders.

TI  - Crohn's disease intestinal CD4+ T cells have impaired interleukin-10 production
      which is not restored by probiotic bacteria.
PG  - 592-601
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Crohn's disease (CD) has been associated with low mucosal interleukin 
      (IL)-10 production, but the mechanism behind this deficiency remains unclear. The
      aim of this study was to investigate IL-10 and interferon (IFN)-gamma production 
      in intestinal CD4+ T cells from CD patients and healthy volunteers (HV) and to
      examine how this was affected by bacterial products and the presence or absence
      of autologous dendritic cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We cultured intestinal CD4+ 
      T cells from CD patients (n=9) and HV (n=6) and differentiated dendritic cells
      from their peripheral monocytes. Intestinal T cells were stimulated with
      Lactobacillus strains or autologous intestinal bacteria in the presence or
      absence of dendritic cells. IL-10 and IFN-gamma were measured on day 4. RESULTS: 
      When there were autologous dendritic cells present, CD intestinal T cells
      produced high levels of IFN-gamma (mean 6.4 ng/ml+/-standard error of the mean
      1.1 ng/ml) but low levels of IL-10 (0.7 ng/ml+/-0.1 ng/ml). In contrast, HV
      intestinal T cells produced less IFN-gamma (3.9 ng/ml+/-0.8 ng/ml, p=0.06) and
      more IL-10 (4.6 ng/ml+/-0.9 ng/ml, p=0.0001) than CD intestinal T cells.
      Co-culture with Lactobacilli failed to revert this imbalance in CD, but tended to
      do so in HV. When there were no dendritic cells, CD intestinal T cells responded 
      to autologous bacteria with an increased IFN-gamma production (2.3+/-1.3 ng/ml)
      compared with HV intestinal T cells (0.3+/-0.2 ng/ml). CONCLUSIONS: Crohn's
      disease intestinal CD4+ T cells display a pro-inflammatory cytokine profile with 
      impaired production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10. Tolerogenic bacteria
      (Lactobacilli) failed to restore this regulatory defect.

TI  - Dietary factors in the modulation of inflammatory bowel disease activity.
PG  - 60
AB  - CONTEXT: As patients look to complementary therapies for management of their
      diseases, it is important that the physician know the effectiveness and/or lack
      of effectiveness of a variety of dietary approaches/interventions. Although the
      pathogenesis of the inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
      disease) is not fully understood, many suspect that diet and various dietary
      factors may play a modulating role in the disease process. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: 
      The purpose of this article is to present some of what is known about various
      dietary/nutritional factors in inflammatory bowel disease, with inclusion of
      evidence from various studies regarding their putative effect. MedLINE was
      searched (1965-present) using combinations of the following search terms: diet,
      inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis.
      Additionally, references of the articles obtained were searched to identify
      further potential sources of information. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: While much
      information is available regarding various dietary interventions/supplements in
      regard to inflammatory bowel disease, the lack of controlled trials limits broad 
      applicability. Probiotics are one of the few interventions with promising results
      and controlled trials. CONCLUSION: While there are many potential and promising
      dietary factors that may play a role in the modulation of inflammatory bowel
      disease, it is prudent to await further controlled studies before broad
      application/physician recommendation in the noted patient population.

      cancer].
PG  - 178-89
AB  - There is no ideal animal model for the study of human pathologies such as IBD or 
      CRC. For the last decade, genetically engineered animal models have been
      incorporated to models induced by exogenous agents. Experimental models of IBD
      reproduce heterogeneous intestinal inflammatory conditions, as it occurs in the
      human being, whereas CRC models imitate those mutations found in man although
      with different phenotypic repercussions. In both cases, these experimental
      systems are influenced by genetics and the environment. Today, animal models
      represent valued, complex, and complete bioassays for the study of new
      therapeutic strategies in IBD (IL-10, anti-IL-12, probiotics) and protective
      agents in CRC (n-3 fatty acids, NSAIDS, and COX-2 inhibitors).

TI  - [Ileo pouch-anal anastomosis].
PG  - 606-11
AB  - Restorative proctocolectomy with an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is the treatment
      of choice in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and familial adenomatous
      polyposis requiring surgical therapy. Pouchitis is the most frequent
      complication, occurring in up to 50% of patients with underlying UC. Clinical
      symptoms of the disease are non-specific. Moreover, surgical complications must
      be differentiated from idiopathic pouchitis using pouchoscopy, endoscopic
      ultrasound or MRI of the pelvis in certain cases. The therapy for idiopathic
      pouchitis, its etiology and pathophysiology being unclear, is based on antibiotic
      treatment, usually with metronidazole or ciprofloxacin. Probiotics such as VSL#3 
      can be used to prevent relapse. In summary, the clinical and functional outcomes 
      are excellent and stable for 20 years after surgery.

TI  - A key role of dendritic cells in probiotic functionality.
PG  - e313
AB  - BACKGROUND: Disruption of the intestinal homeostasis and tolerance towards the
      resident microbiota is a major mechanism involved in the development of
      inflammatory bowel disease. While some bacteria are inducers of disease, others, 
      known as probiotics, are able to reduce inflammation. Because dendritic cells
      (DCs) play a central role in regulating immune responses and in inducing
      tolerance, we investigated their role in the anti-inflammatory potential of
      probiotic lactic acid bacteria. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Selected LAB
      strains, while efficiently taken up by DCs in vitro, induced a partial maturation
      of the cells. Transfer of probiotic-treated DCs conferred protection against 2,
      4, 6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis. Protection was
      associated with a reduction of inflammatory scores and colonic expression of
      pro-inflammatory genes, while a high local expression of the immunoregulatory
      enzyme indolamine 2, 3 dioxgenase (IDO) was observed. The preventive effect of
      probiotic-pulsed DCs required not only MyD88-, TLR2- and NOD2-dependent signaling
      but also the induction of CD4+ CD25+ regulatory cells in an IL-10-independent
      pathway. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Altogether, these results suggest that
      selected probiotics can stimulate DC regulatory functions by targeting specific
      pattern-recognition receptors and pathways. The results not only emphasize the
      role of DCs in probiotic immune interactions, but indicate a possible role in
      immune-intervention therapy for IBD.

AB  - Standard treatment for IBD with 5-ASA, steroids and immunosuppressants is rather 
      effective and currently optimized using combinations of drugs or application
      routes. Among the biologics only infliximab has reached the therapeutic arsenal
      for Crohn's disease--it is as well effective in some patients with ulcerative
      colitis. Early aggressive treatment thus far is not established. Hormones and
      growth factors may play a role. Probiotics have a place in the treatment in
      particular for ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Isolation and characterisation of new putative probiotic bacteria from human
      colonic flora.
PG  - 725-34
AB  - The present study describes a novel bacterial isolate exhibiting high ability to 
      synthesise and secrete butyrate. The novel isolated bacterium was obtained from
      human faeces and grown in selective liquid intestinal microflora medium
      containing rumen fluid under microaerobic conditions. Its probiotic properties
      were demonstrated by the ability of the isolate to survive high acidity and
      medium containing bile acids and the ability to adhere to colon cancer cells
      (Caco-2) in vitro. Phylogenetic identity to Enterococcus durans was established
      using specific primers for 16S rRNA (99% probability). PCR analyses with primers 
      to the bacterial gene encoding butyrate kinase, present in the butyrogenic
      bacteria Clostridium, showed that this gene is present in E. durans. The in vivo 
      immunoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of E. durans were assessed in
      dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in Balb/c mice. Administration of E.
      durans ameliorated histological, clinical and biochemical scores directly related
      to intestinal inflammation whereas the lactic acid bacterium Lactobacillus
      delbrueckii was ineffective in this regard. Colonic cDNA concentrations of
      IL-1beta and TNF-alpha were significantly down regulated in DSS-treated E.
      durans-fed mice but not in control or DSS-treated L. delbrueckii- fed mice.
      Fluorescent in situ hybridisation analyses of colonic tissue from mice fed E.
      durans, using a butyrate kinase probe, demonstrated that E. durans significantly 
      adheres to the colonic tissue. The novel isolated bacterium described in the
      present paper, upon further characterisation, can be developed into a useful
      probiotic aimed at the treatment of patients suffering from ulcerative colitis.

TI  - [Pre- and probiotics].
PG  - 161-9
AB  - Nowadays, the regular consumption of pre- and probiotics is recommended to
      provide various positive health benefits. The in vitro and in vivo demonstrated
      actions on the intestinal microflora, the mucosal barrier and the immunological
      system are very interesting to propose beneficial health effects, but the
      scientific proof in humans is not demonstrated yet. Pre- and probiotics are very 
      active in the intestinal tract (mainly in the colon) by maintaining a healthy gut
      microflora and influencing metabolic, trophic and protective mechanism.
      Prebiotics stimulates the growth of apathogen bacteria and increase the short
      chain fatty acid concentration by fermentation. Short chain fatty acids are
      necessary substrates for a healthy gut. Probiotics inhibit the growth of pathogen
      bacteria, reduce the translocation of bacteria and toxins and modulate the
      intestinal immune system. For some specific clinical diseases (ulcerative
      colitis, pouchitis, diarrhoea) a therapeutic and prophylactic effect with pre-
      and probiotics was shown. In the near future more indications for pre- and
      probiotics (used as a single strain or as in a combination) will be added.
      Promising results are already shown in irritable bowel syndrome, prevention of
      antibiotic induced diarrhoea, in surgical and in intensive care patients. Future 
      studies should focus to determine the characteristics of a healthy gut and the
      evaluation of specific health benefits by well-designed, controlled human studies
      of adequate duration.

TI  - Spotlight on VSL#3 probiotic mixture in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 61-3
AB  - VSL#3 (VSL#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live
      freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human
      gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli
      (Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, and L. delbrueckii subsp.
      bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium longum, B. breve,
      and B. infantis), and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. Data from
      noncomparative trials suggest that VSL#3 has clinical potential in the treatment 
      of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for
      patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. In addition, a randomized,
      open-label, multicenter trial showed that VSL#3 in combination with low-dose
      balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was
      more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the
      treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled studies have shown VSL#3 is effective in preventing the onset 
      of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in
      maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in
      patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. Treatment
      guidelines from the US and the UK include VSL#3 as a therapeutic option for the
      prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. In general,
      VSL#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. Large, well designed, controlled
      confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of VSL#3 in the
      treatment of ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Correlation between in vitro and in vivo immunomodulatory properties of lactic
      acid bacteria.
PG  - 236-43
AB  - AIM: To investigate the correlation between in vitro and in vivo immunomodulation
      potential of the probiotic strain and its ability to prevent experimental colitis
      in mice. METHODS: In vitro immunomodulation was assessed by measuring interleukin
      (IL)-12p70, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interferon gamma
      (IFNgamma) release by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after 24 h
      stimulation with 13 live bacterial strains. A murine model of acute TNBS-colitis 
      was next used to evaluate the prophylactic protective capacity of the same set of
      strains. RESULTS: A strain-specific in vivo protection was observed. The strains 
      displaying an in vitro potential to induce higher levels of the anti-inflammatory
      cytokine IL-10 and lower levels of the inflammatory cytokine IL-12, offered the
      best protection in the in vivo colitis model. In contrast, strains leading to a
      low IL-10/IL-12 cytokine ratio could not significantly attenuate colitis
      symptoms. CONCLUSION: These results show that we could predict the in vivo
      protective capacity of the studied lactic acid bacteria (LAB) based on the
      cytokine profile we established in vitro. The PBMC-based assay we used may thus
      serve as a useful primary indicator to narrow down the number of candidate
      strains to be tested in murine models for their anti-inflammatory potential.

TI  - Multicenter randomized-controlled clinical trial of probiotics (Lactobacillus
      johnsonii, LA1) on early endoscopic recurrence of Crohn's disease after
      lleo-caecal resection.
PG  - 135-42
AB  - BACKGROUND: Seventy percent of Crohn's disease (CD) patients exhibit anastomotic 
      recurrence within 1 year after ileo-caecal surgery. Recent clinical trials
      suggest the beneficial use of probiotics in the control of intestinal
      inflammation in pouchitis and ulcerative colitis. This study is a multicenter
      clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of an oral administration of the probiotic
      LAl on early post-operative endoscopic recurrence of CD. METHODS: Seventy
      patients with CD were enrolled prior to elective ileo-caecal resection and
      randomly assigned after surgery to daily treatment with either Lactobacillus
      johnsonii, LA1, Nestle (1010 colony-forming units, CFU) (group A, n = 34) or
      placebo (group B, n = 36) for 12 weeks. The primary objective was to assess the
      effect of LAl on the endoscopic recurrence rate at 12 weeks. Stratification was
      performed according to smoking status at randomization. RESULTS: Seven and 14
      patients were excluded in the LA1 and placebo groups, respectively. In
      intention-to-treat analysis, the mean endoscopic score was not significantly
      different between the two treatment groups at 3 months (LA1 versus placebo: 1.50 
      +/- 1.32 versus 1.22+/-1.37, treatment effect: P = 0.48, smoke effect: P = 0.72).
      The percentage of patients with severe recurrence (i3 + i4) was 21% and 15% in
      the LAl and placebo groups, respectively (P = 0.33). Using a per-protocol (PP)
      analysis, the mean endoscopic score was not significantly different between the
      two treatment groups (LAl versus placebo groups: 1.44 +/-1.31 versus 1.05 +/-
      1.21, P = 0.32). The percentage of patients with severe recurrence (i3 + i4) was 
      19% and 9% in the LAl and placebo groups, respectively (P = 0.054). Clinical
      relapse rate (CDAI [CD activity index] > 150, with an increase of CDAI > 70
      points or greater from baseline) in the LAl and placebo groups was 15% (4/27) and
      13.5% (3/22), respectively (PP analysis: chi-square test, P = 0.91 and log-rank
      test: P = 0.79). CONCLUSION: Oral administration of the probiotic LA1 in patients
      with CD failed to prevent early endoscopic recurrence at 12 weeks after
      ileo-caecal resection.

TI  - Adherent-invasive Escherichia coli and Crohn's disease.
PG  - 16-20
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The identification of mutations in the nucleotide
      oligomerization domain 2-encoding gene in patients with Crohn's disease suggests 
      a link between the innate immune response to invasive bacteria and the
      development of Crohn's disease. Herein, we review reports concerning the
      association of pathogenic Escherichia coli with the intestinal mucosa of Crohn's 
      disease patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Adherent-invasive E. coli were isolated from
      ileal biopsies of 36.4% of patients with ileal Crohn's disease. Adherent-invasive
      E. coli colonize the intestinal mucosa by adhering to intestinal epithelial
      cells. They are also true invasive pathogens, able to invade intestinal
      epithelial cells and to replicate intracellularly. Adherent-invasive E. coli
      strains replicate extensively into macrophages inducing the secretion of very
      large amounts of tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Similar pathogenic E. coli strains 
      were recently associated with granulomatous colitis of Boxer dogs. Interestingly,
      high levels of E. coli outer membrane protein C antibodies are present in 37-55% 
      of Crohn's disease patients and reactivity to outer membrane protein C is
      associated with increased severity of Crohn's disease. SUMMARY: As the infection 
      cycle of adherent-invasive E. coli could depend upon the ability of these
      pathogenic bacteria to colonize the gastrointestinal tract of genetically
      predisposed Crohn's disease patients, antibiotics which could eradicate the
      bacteria, or probiotics which could substitute them in the gastrointestinal
      tract, could be of therapeutic value in ileal Crohn's disease.
