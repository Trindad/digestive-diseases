TI  - Probiotics and the incidence of colorectal cancer: when evidence is not evident.
PG  - S277-82
AB  - BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second major cause of death from
      cancer in Europe and in the USA. Dietary factors and colonic microflora seem to
      play an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis, making the potential
      protective role of probiotics of overwhelming interest. METHODS AND AIM: This
      article analyzes existing data from basic science (animal and in vitro models)
      and human (epidemiological and interventional) studies to highlight areas for
      which more evidence is necessary. We interrogated Medline for studies analysing
      the risk of CRC and the use of probiotics and also screened the references of
      identified papers. RESULTS: As far as regards animal models, we identified 29
      studies aimed at evaluating the effect of probiotics administration on the
      incidence of CRC and/or of precursor lesions. All but one study using an animal
      model with spontaneous tumour growth in the background of colitis employed
      carcinogens, and most studies employed Lactobacilli or Bifidobacteria. All but 3 
      studies had positive results, and when prebiotics were evaluated too, the
      combination led to an important synergistic effect. The protective effect of
      probiotics seemed more important when they were administered before, and not
      after the carcinogen, and the putative mechanisms are not fully elucidated. Five 
      papers evaluated the effect of probiotics on CRC cell lines in vitro, with
      results suggesting the ability of probiotics to modulate important cell functions
      and in a complex interplay. There are few human epidemiological studies
      specifically designed to analyze the effect of probiotics on CRC incidence, with 
      important confounding factors, such as role of fibers, other dairy products and
      vitamin D often present. Overall, these studies fail to detect significant
      effects of fermented milks against CRC. Interventional studies suggest reduction 
      of surrogate markers for CRC risk. However, one recent study showed no
      significant difference in the development of new CRC following administration of 
      either fibers or probiotics in patients previously treated for colon neoplasm. A 
      single randomised, double blind, placebo controlled pilot interventional trial
      aimed to evaluate the reduction in cancer risk biomarkers obtainable with the
      consumption of a symbiotic has been designed and started but a complete final
      report is not yet available. CONCLUSIONS: In our search of the literature few and
      conflicting epidemiologic data regarding the impact of fermented dairy products
      consumption in humans have been gathered. There are no positive data from
      interventional studies so far. Therefore, even though an ample body of evidence
      supports the potential anticarcinogenic action of probiotics on the basis of the 
      results obtained in both in vitro and in vivo models, further evidence is very
      much needed.

TI  - [Pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases].
PG  - 1965-73
AB  - Genetic predisposition, nutritional and environmental influences, intestinal
      pathogens, psychological stress, and disturbed intestinal barrier function have
      been accepted as important factors in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory
      bowel diseases. Uncontrolled reactions of T-cells and proinflammatoric cytokines 
      are the common denominator of all factors contributing to pathogenesis. The
      detection of NOD2 gene mutation in about 25% of patients with Crohn's disease was
      an important step towards an understanding of the molecular background of the
      disease. The NOD2 proteins functions as an intracellular sensor of bacterial cell
      membrane constituents and is a crucial part of the innate immune system. In
      Crohn's disease, the secretion of defensins, naturally occurring antimicrobial
      peptides, is disturbed. There is evidence that several pathways involved in the
      reaction of the innate immune system may be disturbed in CED, ultimately leading 
      to an uncontrolled activity of the adaptive immune system.

TI  - Are probiotics effective in the treatment of fungal colonization of the
      gastrointestinal tract? Experimental and clinical studies.
PG  - 35-49
AB  - UNLABELLED: The influence of fungal colonization and probiotic treatment on the
      course of gastric ulcer (GU) and ulcerative colitis (UC) was not explored. Our
      studies included: 1) clinical investigation of 293 patients with dyspeptic and
      ulcer complaints and 72 patients with lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract: 60
      patients with UC, 12 with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) - the control group.
      Significant fungal colonization (SFC), over 10(5) CFU/ml was evaluated.
      Mycological investigation was performed, including qualitative and quantitative
      examination, according to Muller method, 2) experimental studies in rats included
      estimation of the influence of inoculation of Candida isolated from human GI
      tract on the healing process of GU, induced by acetic acid with or without
      probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus (10(6) CFU/ml) introduced intragastrically
      (i.g.). At 0, 4, 15 and 25 day after ulcer induction. Weight, damage area,
      gastric blood flow (GBF) (H2 clearance), expression of mRNA for cytokines
      IL-beta, TNF-alpha (ELISA) were evaluated. Mycology: qualitative and quantitative
      examination was performed. MPO serum activity was measured. Results of clinical
      studies: 1) SFC was more frequent in patients with GU: 54.2% of cases and
      patients with over 5 years history of UC: 33.3% cases. 2) SFC delayed GU healing 
      and influenced the maintenance of clinical symptoms in both diseases. Results of 
      animal studies: 3) In Candida inoculated rats, the GBF was significantly lower
      than in the vehicle controls (saline administered group). Upregulation of
      TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta was recorded. The GUs were still present till 25 day in all 
      rats inoculated with Candida, in contrast to vehicle group (reduction of ulcer in
      92% at day 25). CONCLUSIONS: 1) Fungal colonization delays process of ulcer and
      inflammation healing of GI tract mucosa. That effect was attenuated by probiotic 
      therapy. 2) Probiotic therapy seems to be effective in treatment of fungal
      colonization of GI tract. 3) Lactobacillus acidophilus therapy shortens the
      duration of fungal colonization of mucosa (enhanced Candida clearance is
      associated with IL-4, INF-gamma response).

TI  - Clinical usefulness of probiotics in inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 23-33
AB  - Probiotics are live nonpathogenic bacteria or bacterial components that may be
      helpful in the prevention and treatment of acute diarrhoea in adults and children
      and have some effects on the course of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Many
      experimental and clinical studies suggest that intestinal bacterial flora plays
      an important role in the pathogenesis of IBD, and manipulation of the luminal
      contents with antibiotics or probiotics represents a potentially effective
      therapeutic option. The beneficial effect of probiotics was demonstrated mainly
      in the prevention and treatment of pouchitis and in maintaining remission of mild
      to moderate ulcerative colitis. Probiotics seems to be less effective in patients
      with Crohn's disease. Randomized clinical trials are still required to further
      define the role of probiotics as preventive and therapeutic agents. This review
      summarizes the current data about probiotics in IBD.

PG  - 486-98
AB  - Abundant evidence indicates that the intestinal microflora have a role in the
      pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The composition of the gut
      microflora is altered in IBD patients with increased "pathogenic" bacteria and
      decreased bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. In light of this dysbiosis, various
      methods have been examined to alter the composition of the intestinal microflora,
      including the administration of antibiotics and introduction of probiotic
      species. This article summarizes studies evaluating the efficacy of antibiotics
      and probiotics in the induction and maintenance of remission of ulcerative
      colitis, Crohn's disease, and pouchitis.

TI  - Escherichia coli: on-farm contamination of animals.
PG  - 555-69
AB  - Escherichia coli is one of the main inhabitants of the intestinal tract of most
      mammalian species, including humans, and birds. Shiga toxin-producing E. coli
      (STEC), also called verotoxinogenic E. coli, usually do not cause disease in
      animals but may cause watery diarrhoea, haemorrhagic colitis, and/or haemolytic
      uraemic syndrome in humans. Zoonotic STEC include the O157:H7 strains and, with
      increasing frequency, certain non-O157 strains. The importance of non-O157
      zoonotic strains is probably underestimated as they have been less well
      characterised and are more difficult to detect in samples than O157:H7. Another
      large subset of STEC strains has been isolated from animals but has not, at the
      present time, been associated with disease in animals or humans. Cattle and other
      ruminants are the most important reservoir of zoonotic STEC, which are
      transmitted to humans through the ingestion of foods or water contaminated with
      animal faeces, or through direct contact with the infected animals or their
      environment. The main sources of STEC infection of cattle on-farm are the
      drinking water, the feed, and the immediate environment of the animal. Risk
      factors that have been identified for infection of animals with O157 STEC include
      age, weaning, movement of the animals, season, feed composition, and the ability 
      of the bacteria to persist in the environment. On-farm control of the zoonotic
      risk of human infection with STEC should primarily target the main source of
      contamination: the animal reservoir. Various strategies to reduce intestinal
      colonisation of cattle by zoonotic STEC have been tried with varying results,
      including vaccination, treatment with probiotics, such as direct-fed microbials
      or competitive exclusion, administration of bacteriophages, and modification of
      the diet.

TI  - [Probiotics--should we change the treatment strategy for pouchitis?].
PG  - 3516-8
AB  - Pouchitis is an idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease, which occurs in up to 50% 
      of patients operated on for ulcerative colitis with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis 
      (IPAA). Treatment of pouchitis is still to a large extent empirical, but recently
      more randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trials have been conducted. This
      article reviews the possible treatments for pouchitis, focusing especially on
      treatment with probiotics, which seem to be a new and promising alternative to
      antibiotics. We are currently doing clinical trials to determine whether a
      probiotic is an effective treatment for chronic inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Homeostatic effects of TLR9 signaling in experimental colitis.
PG  - 351-5
AB  - The commensal microflora of the intestinal tract confer multiple health benefits 
      to the host, including amelioration of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Yet, the
      exact mechanisms by which it ameliorates experimental colitis in animals and
      human IBD are largely unknown. We tested whether the attenuation of experimental 
      colitis by probiotic bacteria is mediated by toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. 
      The severity of colitis was attenuated by delivery of nonviable,
      gamma-irradiated, or by viable probiotics, but not by heat-killed probiotics, in 
      wild-type mice in mice deficient in TLR2 or TLR4. In contrast we did not observe 
      any inhibition of experimental colitis by probiotics, in mice deficient in MyD88 
      or TLR9. Furthermore, administration of probiotic DNA ameliorated the severity of
      experimental colitis, whereas methylated probiotic DNA, calf thymus DNA, and
      Dnase-treated probiotics had no effect. In subsequent studies, we identified that
      TLR9-induced type 1 IFN mediates the anti-inflammatory effects in experimental
      colitis. The addition of neutralization antibodies to type 1 IFN abolished the
      anti-inflammatory effects, whereas the administration of recombinant IFN-beta
      mimicked the anti-inflammatory effects induced by TLR9 agonists. Taken together, 
      these results indicate that the protective effects of probiotics are mainly
      mediated by their own DNA rather than by their metabolites or their ability to
      colonize the colon. These findings underscore the diverse effects of indigenous
      microbial TLR ligands in intestinal homeostasis and intestinal inflammation and
      suggest that strategies, that modulate type 1 IFN may be of therapeutic value for
      intestinal inflammatory conditions.

TI  - Probiotics: do they help to control intestinal inflammation?
PG  - 339-50
AB  - There is currently a growing appreciation for the role of the enteric flora in
      health and disease. In the past years overwhelming evidence has accumulated for
      the role of commensal gut bacteria in the inflammatory bowel diseases Crohn's
      disease and ulcerative colitis. Both entities are mainly located in areas with
      high bacterial concentrations. Reduction of the enteric bacterial concentration
      by antibiotics, lavage, or surgical bypass results in a mitigation of symptoms,
      while experimental colitis models depend on the presence of the bacterial flora
      and the NOD2/CARD15-mutation results in inefficient clearance of invasive
      bacteria. Those findings helped to bring the concept of probiotic therapy to the 
      forefront, a therapy that had been known for millennia, but had been disregarded 
      by the scientific world. Probiotics are meanwhile established in the maintenance 
      therapy of ulcerative colitis and chronic recurrent or refractory pouchitis.
      Promising data exist for the primary prevention of pouchitis. Probiotic research 
      at the intersection of gastroenterology, immunology and microbiology is highly
      dynamic in both the basic and the clinical field. Further understanding of the
      complex molecular mechanisms leading to the effectiveness of probiotics will also
      spur the development of more successful probiotic formulations.

TI  - Interventions for treating collagenous colitis.
PG  - CD003575
AB  - BACKGROUND: Collagenous colitis is a disorder that is recognized as a cause of
      chronic diarrhea. Treatment has been based mainly on anecdotal evidence. This
      review was performed to identify therapies for collagenous colitis that have been
      proven in randomized trials. OBJECTIVES: To determine effective treatments for
      patients with clinically active collagenous colitis. SEARCH STRATEGY: Relevant
      papers published between 1970 and June 2006 were identified via the MEDLINE and
      PUBMED databases. Manual searches from the references of identified papers, as
      well as review papers on collagenous or microscopic colitis were performed to
      identify additional studies. Abstracts from major gastroenterological meetings
      were searched to identify research submitted in abstract form only. Finally, the 
      Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease
      and Functional Bowel Disorders Group Specialized Trials Register were searched
      for other studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Seven randomized trials were identified.
      One trial studied bismuth subsalicylate (published in abstract form only), one
      trial studied Boswellia serrata extract (published in abstract form only), one
      trial studied probiotics, one trial studied prednisolone, and 3 trials studied
      budesonide for the therapy of collagenous colitis. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: 
      Data were extracted independently by each author onto 2x2 tables (treatment
      versus placebo and response versus no response). For therapies assessed in one
      trial only, p-values were derived using the chi-square test. For therapies
      assessed in more than one trial, summary test statistics were derived using the
      Peto odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals. Data were combined for analysis
      only if the outcomes were sufficiently similar in definition. MAIN RESULTS: There
      were 9 patients with collagenous colitis in the trial studying bismuth
      subsalicylate (nine 262 mg tablets daily for 8 weeks). Those randomized to active
      drug were more likely to have clinical (p = 0.003) and histological (p = 0.003)
      improvement than those assigned to placebo. Eleven patients were enrolled in the 
      trial studying prednisolone (50 mg daily for 2 weeks). There was a trend towards 
      clinical response in patients on active medication compared to placebo (p =
      0.064). The effect of prednisolone on histologic improvement was not studied.
      Thirty-one patients were enrolled in the Boswellia serrata extract trial.
      Clinical improvement was noted in 44% of patients who received active treatment
      compared to 27% of patients who received placebo (p = 0.32). Twenty-nine patients
      were enrolled in the probiotics trial. Clinical improvement was noted in 29% of
      patients who received probiotics compared to 13% of patients who received placebo
      (p = 0.635). A total of 94 patients were enrolled in 3 trials studying budesonide
      (9 mg daily or in a tapering schedule for 6 to 8 weeks). The pooled odds ratio
      for clinical response to treatment with budesonide was 12.32 (95% CI 5.53-27.46),
      with a number needed to treat of 2 patients. There was significant histological
      improvement with treatment in all 3 trials studying budesonide therapy.
      Budesonide also appears to improve patients' quality of life. AUTHORS'
      CONCLUSIONS: Budesonide is effective for the treatment of collagenous colitis.
      The evidence for benefit with bismuth subsalicylate is weaker. The effectiveness 
      of prednisolone, Boswellia serrata extract, probiotics and other therapies for
      induction or maintenance of remission of collagenous colitis is unknown and
      requires further study.

TI  - Current therapy of inflammatory bowel disease in children.
PG  - 279-302
AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD) are chronic intestinal
      inflammatory diseases that can present as bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and
      malnutrition. Collectively, these disorders are referred to as inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). All patients with IBD share a common pathophysiology. However,
      there are a number of developmental, psychosocial, and physiologic issues that
      are unique to the approximate, equals 20% of patients that present during
      childhood or adolescence. These include the possibility of disease-induced delays
      in linear growth or physical development, differences in drug dosing, and the
      changes in social and cognitive development that occur as children move from
      school-age years into adolescence and early adulthood. Gastroenterologists caring
      for these children must therefore develop an optimal regimen of pharmacologic
      therapies, nutritional management, psychologic support, and properly timed
      surgery (when necessary) that will maintain disease remission, minimize disease
      and drug-induced adverse effects, and optimize growth and development. This
      article reviews current approaches to the management of patients with UC and CD
      and highlights issues specific to the treatment of children with IBD. The
      principal medical therapies used to induce disease remission in patients with UC 
      are aminosalicylates (for mild disease), corticosteroids (for moderate disease), 
      and cyclosporine (ciclosporin) (for severe disease). If a patient responds to the
      induction regimen, maintenance therapies that are used to prevent disease relapse
      include aminosalicylates, mercaptopurine, and azathioprine. Colectomy with
      creation of an ileal pouch anal anastomosis (J pouch) has become the standard of 
      care for patients with severe or refractory colitis and results in an improved
      quality of life in most patients. Therefore, the risks associated with using
      increasingly potent immunosuppressant agents must be balanced in each case
      against a patient's desire to retain their colon and avoid a temporary or
      potentially permanent ileostomy. Decisions about drug therapy in the management
      of patients with CD are more complex and depend on both the location (e.g.
      gastroduodenal vs small intestinal vs colonic), as well as the behavior of the
      disease (inflammatory/mucosal vs stricturing vs perforating) in a given patient. 
      Induction therapies for CD typically include aminosalicylates and antibiotics
      (for mild mucosal disease), nutritional therapy (including elemental or polymeric
      formulas), corticosteroids (for moderate disease), and infliximab (for
      corticosteroid-resistant or fistulizing disease). Aminosalicylates,
      mercaptopurine, azathioprine, methotrexate, and infliximab can be used as
      maintenance therapies. Because surgical treatment of CD is not curative, it is
      typically reserved for those patients either with persistent symptoms and disease
      limited to a small section of the intestine (e.g. the terminal ileum and cecum)
      or for the management of complications of the disease including stricture or
      abdominal abscess. When surgery is necessary, maintenance medications
      administered postoperatively will postpone recurrence. Patients with UC and CD
      are at risk for the development of micronutrient deficiencies (including folate, 
      iron, and vitamin D deficiencies) and require close nutritional monitoring. In
      addition, patients with UC and CD involving the colon are at increased risk of
      developing colon cancer, and should be enrolled into a colonoscopy surveillance
      program after 8-10 years of disease duration.

AB  - Ulcerative colitis is an important disease in the paediatric population.
      Ulcerative colitis is one of the chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, and is
      medically incurable. However, the arsenal of medications has grown as knowledge
      of the pathogenesis of this disease advances. This review looks at the classical 
      treatments for children with ulcerative colitis, including the
      5-aminosalicylates, corticosteroids and imunomodulators, as well as biological
      therapy and other, newer modalities.

TI  - Medical management of left-sided ulcerative colitis and ulcerative proctitis:
      critical evaluation of therapeutic trials.
PG  - 979-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: The goal of this work was to critically evaluate the published
      studies on the treatment of ulcerative proctitis (UP) and left-sided ulcerative
      colitis (L-UC). The results of this review provided the content for the
      accompanying treatment guidelines, Clinical Guidelines for the Medical Management
      of Left-sided Ulcerative Colitis and Ulcerative Proctitis: Summary Statement.
      METHODS: All English language articles published between 1995 and September 2005 
      were identified through a comprehensive literature search using OVID and PubMed. 
      The quality of the data supporting or rejecting the use of specific therapies was
      categorized by a data quality grading scale. An "A+" grade was assigned to
      treatment supported by multiple high-quality randomized controlled trials with
      consistent results, whereas a "D" grade was given to therapy supported only by
      expert opinion. The therapeutic efficacy of a treatment was defined by its
      success in treating UP and L-UC compared with placebo. A medication was ranked as
      "excellent" if it was specifically studied for UP and L-UC and had consistently
      positive results compared with placebo or another agent. Quality and efficacy
      scores were agreed on by author consensus. RESULTS: For the acute treatment of UP
      or L-UC, the rectally administered corticosteroids and mesalazine (5-ASA), either
      alone or in combination with oral 5-ASAs, are the most effective therapy:
      evidence quality, A+; efficacy, excellent. Only rectally administered 5-ASA
      received an A+/excellent rating for maintenance of remission. Infliximab received
      an A+ grade for induction and maintenance of remission but only a "good" rating
      because the studies were performed in all UC, not specifically UP or L-UC.
      CONCLUSIONS: This critical evaluation of treatment provides a "report card" on
      medications available for the management of patients with UP and L-UC. The
      guidelines should provide a useful reference and supplement for physicians
      treating UC patients.

PG  - 5941-50
AB  - The prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells of the colon exist in a highly complex, but 
      harmonious relationship. Disturbances in this remarkable symbiosis can result in 
      the development of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Although the etiology of
      IBD is not entirely understood, it is known that the chronic inflammation of
      Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and chronic pouchitis are a result of an
      overly aggressive immune response to the commensal intestinal flora in
      genetically susceptible hosts. Recent studies have enhanced our ability to
      understand the interaction between the host and its intestinal microflora and the
      role the microflora plays in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. As we begin to
      understand the benefits conferred to the intestine by the microflora, the notion 
      of modifying the composition of the bacterial load to improve human health has
      arisen. A significant body of research now exists investigating the role of
      probiotics and prebiotics in ameliorating chronic intestinal inflammation. This
      article will begin with an overview of the role of the commensal microflora in
      maintaining mucosal immune homeostasis, and how a dysregulated immune response to
      the intestinal microflora results in IBD. This will be followed by a summary of
      the use of probiotics and prebiotics in experimental and human IBD.

AB  - Current data show that probiotics are more effective in preventing the
      recrudescence of an inflammatory process than in suppressing active disease. This
      is reflected in the solid evidence for the effect of E. coli Nissle 1917
      (Mutaflor) in the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis, and of VSL#3 in
      preventing the recurrence of pouchitis. These indications have since been
      incorporated in valid guidelines. Initial clinical studies have also provided
      promising results regarding the efficacy of VSL#3 in preventing pouchitis
      immediately following proctocolectomy.

TI  - [Therapeutic possibilities of probiotics in antibiotic-related diarrhea].
PG  - 28-30
AB  - One of the major problems associated with the use of antibiotics is the
      occurrence of antibiotic-related diarrhea. Although most such cases of diarrhea
      are harmless, in individual cases it may lead on to fulminant colitis. In 10-20% 
      of the patients, the causal factor is infection with Clostridium difficile, which
      multiplies unhindered in patients on antibiotics. In the meantime, controlled,
      randomized studies have shown that probiotics can exercise a preventive effect in
      antibiotic-related diarrhea. The administration of Saccharomyces boulardii or
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG reduces the relative risk of an antibiotic-related
      diarrhea developing by 0.5. The data are more uniform in children than in adults.

PG  - 90-5
AB  - Undigested carbohydrates reaching the colon can act as competitors for epithelial
      bacterial receptors, making it difficult for noncommensal bacteria to adhere to
      them. On the contrary, fermentation of these carbohydrates by anaerobic flora
      produces - among other substrates - butyrate that is involved in numerous
      important metabolic processes. These include the provision of energy to the
      colonocytes, the enhancement of sodium and water absorption and the synthesis of 
      mucus and cell membranes. In addition, butyrate inhibits the nuclear
      translocation of the transcription factor NFkappaB, which exerts a potent
      anti-inflammatory activity. Clinical experience with probiotics in inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) is controversial. Whereas some probiotic preparations appear 
      to be useful in ulcerative colitis (UC) and pouchitis, most attempts to use
      probiotics for treating or preventing recurrence in Crohn's disease have failed. 
      It should be pointed out that - unlike in the small bowel - the colon and ileal
      pouches are well-established microbiological ecosystems with increasing amounts
      of a wide variety of bacterial strains. These bacterial strains have a high
      degree of metabolic interaction with luminal nutrients and a greater probability 
      of developing dysbiosis. With this in mind, the rationale for using pre- and
      probiotics appears to be stronger for colonic IBD (UC or Crohn's colitis) and
      pouchitis than for IBD mostly involving the small bowel.

      bowel disease.
PG  - 11-8
AB  - We review the evidence that strongly suggests a role of the intestinal microbiota
      in the onset and perpetuation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Experimental
      studies consisted of suppressing micro-organisms from the microbiota (using
      germ-free or gnotoxenic animals or antibiotics), introducing new micro-organisms 
      or microbial components (e.g. probiotics, CpG-DNA) or selectively increasing some
      endogenous bacteria (e.g. using prebiotics). Intervention studies were performed 
      in patients or animal models of spontaneous or chemically-induced colitis.
      Information was also obtained from observational studies that described the
      composition of the faecal and mucosal microbiota at various stages of the disease
      process and in controls. Many have used culture-independent techniques that
      identify bacteria based on the nucleic acid sequence of ribosomal RNA molecules. 
      Microbiota in patients with IBD seem to be characterized by high concentrations
      of bacteria in contact with the mucosa, instability, the presence of high numbers
      of unusual bacteria and sometimes a reduction in the biodiversity. Studies
      searching for a generalized or localized dysbiosis in IBD are discussed, as well 
      as those trying to identify bacterial molecules and receptors, which may be
      implicated in triggering the inflammatory process.

      mouse colitis model.
PG  - 5799-805
AB  - Studies showed that specific probiotics might provide therapeutic benefits in
      inflammatory bowel disease. However, a rigorous screening of new probiotics is
      needed to study possible adverse interactions with the host, particularly when
      intended for administration to individuals with certain health risks. In this
      context, the objective of this study was to investigate the role of three
      lactobacilli (LAB) on intestinal inflammation and bacterial translocation using
      variations of the mouse model of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid
      (TNBS)-induced acute colitis. We first compared the in vitro ability of LAB to
      survive gastrointestinal tract (GIT) conditions and their ability to persist in
      the GIT of mice following daily oral administration. As a control, we included a 
      nonprobiotic Lactobacillus paracasei strain, previously isolated from an
      endocarditis patient. Feeding high doses of LAB strains to healthy and to
      TNBS-treated mice did not induce any detrimental effect or abnormal translocation
      of the bacteria. Oral administration of Lactobacillus salivarius Ls-33 had a
      significant preventive effect on colitis in mice, while Lactobacillus plantarum
      Lp-115 and Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM did not. None of the three selected LAB
      strains translocated to extraintestinal organs of TNBS-treated mice. In contrast,
      L. paracasei exacerbated colitis under severe inflammatory conditions and
      translocated to extraintestinal organs. This study showed that evaluations of the
      safety and functionality of new probiotics are recommended. We conclude that not 
      all lactobacilli have similar effects on intestinal inflammation and that
      selected probiotics such as L. salivarius Ls-33 may be considered in the
      prevention or treatment of intestinal inflammation.

      abnormal response to the gut microbiota. This review discusses advances in
      knowledge of the changes in gut microbiota and host response in inflammatory
      bowel disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Approximately 15% of Crohn's disease cases in
      western populations result from mutations in NOD2/CARD15. This disease leads to
      defective intestinal defensin production and defective monocyte interleukin-8
      response to bacterial peptidoglycan. A similar defective interleukin-8 response
      and consequent delayed neutrophil recruitment have also been shown in patients
      with Crohn's disease who do not have the NOD2 mutation. A consequence seems to be
      the accumulation in tissue of macrophages containing various bacteria, perhaps
      particularly Escherichia coli. In keeping with this patients with Crohn's disease
      have circulating antibodies against bacterial flagellar proteins of
      enterobacteria and clostridia. In ulcerative colitis, there is less evidence for 
      invasion by or immune response to bacteria but changes in gut microbiota include 
      a relative deficiency of bifidobacteria. There is considerable interest in
      probiotic or prebiotic therapies although so far little evidence for their
      efficacy. SUMMARY: Molecular techniques are giving us better insight into the gut
      microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease that should translate into improved
      therapies.

TI  - Review article: prebiotics in the gastrointestinal tract.
PG  - 701-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prebiotics are short-chain carbohydrates that alter the composition, 
      or metabolism, of the gut microbiota in a beneficial manner. It is therefore
      expected that prebiotics will improve health in a way similar to probiotics,
      whilst at the same time being cheaper, and carrying less risk and being easier to
      incorporate into the diet than probiotics. AIM: To review published evidence for 
      prebiotic effects on gut function and human health. METHODS: We searched the
      Science Citation Index with the terms prebiotic, microbiota, gut bacteria, large 
      intestine, mucosa, bowel habit, constipation, diarrhoea, inflammatory bowel
      disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, calcium and cancer,
      focussing principally on studies in humans and reports in the English language.
      Search of the Cochrane Library did not identify any clinical study or
      meta-analysis on this topic. RESULTS: Three prebiotics, oligofructose,
      galacto-oligosaccharides and lactulose, clearly alter the balance of the large
      bowel microbiota by increasing bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus numbers. These
      carbohydrates are fermented and give rise to short-chain fatty acid and
      intestinal gas; however, effects on bowel habit are relatively small.
      Randomized-controlled trials of their effect in a clinical context are few,
      although animal studies show anti-inflammatory effects in inflammatory bowel
      disease, while calcium absorption is increased. CONCLUSIONS: It is still early
      days for prebiotics, but they offer the potential to modify the gut microbial
      balance in such a way as to bring direct health benefits cheaply and safely.

TI  - VSL#3 probiotic mixture: a review of its use in chronic inflammatory bowel
      diseases.
PG  - 1371-87
AB  - VSL#3 (VSL#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live
      freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human
      gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli
      (Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp.
      bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium longum, B. breve
      and B. infantis) and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. Data from
      noncomparative trials suggest that VSL#3 has clinical potential in the treatment 
      of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for
      patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. In addition, a randomised,
      open-label, multicentre trial showed that VSL#3 in combination with low-dose
      balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was
      more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the
      treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Randomised, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled studies have shown VSL#3 is effective in preventing the onset 
      of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in
      maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in
      patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. Treatment
      guidelines from the US and the UK include VSL#3 as a therapeutic option for the
      prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. In general,
      VSL#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. Large, well designed, controlled
      confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of VSL#3 in the
      treatment of ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Therapeutic approaches targeting intestinal microflora in inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 4452-60
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease, are chronic
      intestinal disorders of unknown etiology in which in genetically susceptible
      individuals, the mucosal immune system shows an aberrant response towards
      commensal bacteria. The gastrointestinal tract has developed ingenious mechanisms
      to coexist with its autologous microflora, but rapidly responds to invading
      pathogens and then returns to homeostasis with its commensal bacteria after the
      pathogenic infection is cleared. In case of disruption of this tightly-regulated 
      homeostasis, chronic intestinal inflammation may be induced. Previous studies
      showed that some commensal bacteria are detrimental while others have either no
      influence or have a protective action. In addition, each host has a genetically
      determined response to detrimental and protective bacterial species. These
      suggest that therapeutic manipulation of imbalance of microflora can influence
      health and disease. This review focuses on new insights into the role of
      commensal bacteria in gut health and disease, and presents recent findings in
      innate and adaptive immune interactions. Therapeutic approaches to modulate
      balance of intestinal microflora and their potential mechanisms of action are
      also discussed.

      toll-like receptor 2- and toll-like receptor 4-dependent pathways.
PG  - 4075-82
AB  - Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are key components of the innate immune system that
      trigger antimicrobial host defense responses. The aim of the present study was to
      analyze the effects of probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle strain 1917 in
      experimental colitis induced in TLR-2 and TLR-4 knockout mice. Colitis was
      induced in wild-type (wt), TLR-2 knockout, and TLR-4 knockout mice via
      administration of 5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Mice were treated with either 
      0.9% NaCl or 10(7) E. coli Nissle 1917 twice daily, followed by the determination
      of disease activity, mucosal damage, and cytokine secretion. wt and TLR-2
      knockout mice exposed to DSS developed acute colitis, whereas TLR-4 knockout mice
      developed significantly less inflammation. In wt mice, but not TLR-2 or TLR-4
      knockout mice, E. coli Nissle 1917 ameliorated colitis and decreased
      proinflammatory cytokine secretion. In TLR-2 knockout mice a selective reduction 
      of gamma interferon secretion was observed after E. coli Nissle 1917 treatment.
      In TLR-4 knockout mice, cytokine secretion was almost undetectable and not
      modulated by E. coli Nissle 1917, indicating that TLR-4 knockout mice do not
      develop colitis similar to the wt mice. Coculture of E. coli Nissle 1917 and
      human T cells increased TLR-2 and TLR-4 protein expression in T cells and
      increased NF-kappaB activity via TLR-2 and TLR-4. In conclusion, our data provide
      evidence that E. coli Nissle 1917 ameliorates experimental induced colitis in
      mice via TLR-2- and TLR-4-dependent pathways.

TI  - Probiotics and inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 376-82
AB  - Enteric microflora profiles vary considerably between active inflammatory bowel
      diseases (IBD) and healthy conditions. Intestinal microflora may partake in the
      pathogenesis of IBD by one or some ways: specific pathogenic infection induces
      abnormal intestinal mucosal inflammation; aberrant microflora components trigger 
      the onset of IBD; abnormal host immune response loses normal immune tolerance to 
      luminal components; luminal antigens permeate through the defective mucosal
      barrier into mucosal lamina propria and induce abnormal inflammatory response.
      Preliminary studies suggest that administration of probiotics may be benefit for 
      experimental colitis and clinical trials for IBD. Researches have been studying
      the function of probiotics. Introduction of probiotics can balance the aberrant
      enteric microflora in IBD patients, and reinforce the various lines of intestinal
      defence by inhibiting microbial pathogens growth, increasing intestinal
      epithelial tight junction and permeability, modulating immune response of
      intestinal epithelia and mucosal immune cells, secreting antimicrobial products, 
      decomposing luminal pathogenic antigens.

TI  - Antibiotics and probiotics in treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 3306-13
AB  - Many experimental and clinical observations suggest that intestinal microflora
      plays a potential role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
      Manipulation of the luminal content using antibiotics or probiotics represents a 
      potentially effective therapeutic option. The available studies do not support
      the use of antibiotics in ulcerative colitis (UC). Antibiotics are effective in
      treating septic complications of Crohn's disease (CD) but their use as a primary 
      therapy is more controversial, although this approach is frequently and
      successfully adopted in clinical practice. There is evidence that probiotic
      therapy may be effective in the prevention and treatment of mild to moderate UC. 
      In contrast, a lack of successful study data at present precludes the widespread 
      use of probiotics in the treatment of CD. Both antibiotics and probiotics appear 
      to play a beneficial role in the treatment and prevention of pouchitis and
      further trials are warranted to fully quantify their clinical efficacy.

TI  - Use of complementary and alternative medicine in Germany - a survey of patients
      with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 19
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested an increasing use of complementary
      and alternative medicine (CAM) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
      The aim of our study was to evaluate the use of CAM in German patients with IBD. 
      METHODS: A questionnaire was offered to IBD patients participating in patient
      workshops which were organized by a self-help association, the German Crohn's and
      Colitis Association. The self-administered questionnaire included demographic and
      disease-related data as well as items analysing the extent of CAM use and
      satisfaction with CAM treatment. Seven commonly used CAM methods were
      predetermined on the questionnaire. RESULTS: 413 questionnaires were completed
      and included in the analysis (n = 153 male, n = 260 female; n = 246 Crohn's
      disease, n = 164 ulcerative colitis). 52 % of the patients reported CAM use in
      the present or past. In detail, homeopathy (55%), probiotics (43%), classical
      naturopathy (38%), Boswellia serrata extracts (36%) and acupuncture/Traditional
      Chinese Medicine (TCM) (33%) were the most frequently used CAM methods. Patients 
      using probiotics, acupuncture and Boswellia serrata extracts (incense) reported
      more positive therapeutic effects than others. Within the statistical analysis no
      significant predictors for CAM use were found. 77% of the patients felt
      insufficiently informed about CAM. CONCLUSION: The use of CAM in IBD patients is 
      very common in Germany, although a large proportion of patients felt that
      information about CAM is not sufficient. However, to provide an evidence-based
      approach more research in this field is desperately needed. Therefore, physicians
      should increasingly inform IBD patients about benefits and limitations of CAM
      treatment.

TI  - Anti-inflammatory potential of the probiotic dietary supplement Lactibiane
      Tolerance: in vitro and in vivo considerations.
PG  - 994-1003
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Probiotics are live microorganisms which when administered in 
      adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host. In inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD), where major modifications of the intestinal microflora have been
      reported, there is an increasing interest in modulating the flora with probiotic 
      products. This work addresses the anti-inflammatory potential of Lactibiane
      Tolerance, a probiotic dietary supplement (mixture of four strains) using in
      vitro and in vivo approaches. METHODS: Comparison of the four individual strains 
      and the commercial product reconstituted from them was conducted by in vitro
      tests (cytokine release after 24h stimulation of human peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMC)). The potential immunomodulatory characteristics of
      Lactibiane Tolerance were determined in vivo in an acute mice model of
      2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis. Assessment of colitis
      included blinded histological and macroscopic scores. RESULTS: We showed that
      Lactibiane Tolerance has anti-inflammatory properties in vitro by stimulating
      IL-10 production and in vivo by conferring a significant protective effect in the
      TNBS-induced colitis model (more than 50% decrease of colitis symptoms, P<0.01). 
      CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that a probiotic dietary supplement,
      Lactibiane Tolerance, can significantly prevent the initial injury of TNBS and
      could stimulate the initiation of clinical trials in IBD.

TI  - Efficacy of Lactobacillus GG in maintaining remission of ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1567-74
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aminosalicylates are the mainstay of therapy to prevent relapse of
      quiescent ulcerative colitis. The rationale for using probiotics is based on the 
      evidence implicating intestinal bacteria in the pathogenesis of this disorder.
      AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of Lactobacillus GG alone or in combination with
      mesalazine vs. mesalazine as maintenance treatment in ulcerative colitis.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: 187 ulcerative colitis patients with quiescent disease were
      randomized to receive Lactobacillus GG 18 x 10(9) viable bacteria/day (65
      patients), mesalazine 2400 mg/day (60 patients) or Lactobacillus GG + mesalazine 
      (62 patients). Disease activity index, endoscopic and histological scores were
      determined at 0, 6 and 12 months and in case of relapse. The primary end point
      was to evaluate sustained remission. RESULTS: Overall analysis showed no
      difference in relapse rate at 6 (P = 0.44) and 12 months (P = 0.77) among the
      three treatment groups. However, the treatment with Lactobacillus GG seems to be 
      more effective than standard treatment with mesalazine in prolonging the
      relapse-free time (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Lactobacillus GG seems to be effective
      and safe for maintaining remission in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it
      could represent a good therapeutic option for preventing relapse in this group of
      patients.

TI  - Systematic review: microscopic colitis.
PG  - 1525-34
AB  - BACKGROUND: Collagenous and lymphocytic colitis are fairly common causes of
      chronic non-bloody diarrhoea, especially in elderly female. AIM: To present a
      systematic review of microscopic colitis. METHODS: A PubMed search using the MeSH
      terms microscopic colitis, collagenous colitis, lymphocytic colitis and chronic
      diarrhoea was performed. RESULTS: Annual incidence of each disorder is
      4-6/100,000 inhabitants. The aetiology is unknown. Clinical characteristics are
      well described and there is an association with autoimmune diseases. Budesonide
      is the best-documented short-term treatment of collagenous colitis. In
      meta-analysis pooled odds ratio for clinical response after 6-8 weeks of
      treatment was 12.3 (95% CI: 5.5-27.5) in comparison with placebo. The evidence
      for bismuth subsalicylate is weaker and the effectiveness of other alternatives
      such as loperamide, cholestyramine, aminosalicylates, probiotics, or Boswellia
      serrata extract is unknown. Although unproven, in unresponsive severe disease
      azathioprine or methotrexate may be tried. No controlled trials have been carried
      out in lymphocytic colitis. The long-term prognosis of microscopic colitis is
      good, serious complications are rare and there is no increased mortality.
      CONCLUSIONS: Clinical and epidemiological aspects of microscopic colitis are well
      described. Budesonide is the best-documented short-term therapy in collagenous
      colitis, but the optimal long-term strategy needs further study. Controlled
      treatment data of lymphocytic colitis are awaited for.

TI  - Probiotic treatment of collagenous colitis: a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial with Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium
      animalis subsp. Lactis.
PG  - 395-401
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotic treatment may be effective in diseases involving gut
      microflora and intestinal inflammation. In collagenous colitis (CC), a potential 
      pathogenic role of the gut microflora has been proposed. The effect of probiotic 
      treatment in CC is unknown. Our aim was to investigate the clinical effect of
      treatment with Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp.
      lactis BB-12 (AB-Cap-10) in patients with CC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients
      with CC and diarrhea were in a double-blind placebo-controlled study randomized
      (2:1) to AB-Cap-10 or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary end point was reduction
      in bowel frequency per week of >or=50%. Secondary end points were changes in
      bowel frequencies, stool consistency, stool weight, histopathology, and abdominal
      bloating and pain. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were randomized: 21 to
      probiotics and 8 to placebo. Reduction in bowel frequency per week of >or=50%
      occurred in 6 of 21 (29%) and in 1 of 8 (13%) patients receiving probiotic and
      placebo, respectively (P = 0.635). No differences between treatments were
      observed regarding the secondary end points. Post hoc analysis showed a median
      reduction in bowel frequency per week from 32 (range 18-84) to 23 (range 11-56; P
      < 0.005), a reduction in number of days with liquid stools per week from 6 days
      (range 0-7 days) to 1 day (range 0-7 days; P < 0.005), and an increase in number 
      of days with solid stools per week (P < 0.05) in the AB-Cap-10 group.
      CONCLUSIONS: AB-Cap-10 had no significant effect on the chosen end points. Post
      hoc analysis demonstrated amelioration of clinical symptoms in the AB-Cap-10
      group, indicating that probiotic treatment may potentially influence the disease 
      course of CC.

TI  - Meta-analysis of probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic associated diarrhea 
      and the treatment of Clostridium difficile disease.
PG  - 812-22
AB  - CONTEXT: Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) is a common complication of most
      antibiotics and Clostridium difficile disease (CDD), which also is incited by
      antibiotics, is a leading cause of nosocomial outbreaks of diarrhea and colitis. 
      The use of probiotics for these two related diseases remains controversial.
      OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of probiotics for the prevention of AAD and
      the treatment of CDD based on the published randomized, controlled clinical
      trials. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar, NIH registry of clinical
      trials, metaRegister, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were
      searched from 1977 to 2005, unrestricted by language. Secondary searches of
      reference lists, authors, reviews, commentaries, associated diseases, books, and 
      meeting abstracts. STUDY SELECTION: Trials were included in which specific
      probiotics given to either prevent or treat the diseases of interest. Trials were
      required to be randomized, controlled, blinded efficacy trials in humans
      published in peer-reviewed journals. Trials that were excluded were pre-clinical,
      safety, Phase 1 studies in volunteers, reviews, duplicate reports, trials of
      unspecified probiotics, trials of prebiotics, not the disease being studied, or
      inconsistent outcome measures. Thirty-one of 180 screened studies (totally 3,164 
      subjects) met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. DATA EXTRACTION: One reviewer
      identified studies and abstracted data on sample size, population
      characteristics, treatments, and outcomes. DATA SYNTHESIS: From 25 randomized
      controlled trials (RCTs), probiotics significantly reduced the relative risk of
      AAD (RR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.31, 0.58, p < 0.001). From six randomized trials,
      probiotics had significant efficacy for CDD (RR = 0.59, 95% CI 0.41, 0.85, p =
      0.005). CONCLUSION: A variety of different types of probiotics show promise as
      effective therapies for these two diseases. Using meta-analyses, three types of
      probiotics (Saccharomyces boulardii, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, and probiotic
      mixtures) significantly reduced the development of antibiotic-associated
      diarrhea. Only S. boulardii was effective for CDD.

TI  - Recommendations for probiotic use.
PG  - 275-8
AB  - Probiotics are live microbial organisms that are administrated as supplements or 
      in foods to benefit the host. It is the recommendation that they may be helpful
      in the prevention and treatment of acute diarrhea in adults and children, the
      prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in adults and children, and the
      maintenance of remission and prevention of pouchitis. Although early results
      indicate that probiotics may also be useful in immunologic modulation to prevent 
      atopy, treatment of radiation intestinal disease, vaginosis, ulcerative colitis, 
      and the irritable bowel syndrome, the studies available are not sufficient to say
      they are definitely helpful. Even fewer data are available to recommend
      probiotics for the treatment of H pylori and Crohn disease and for the prevention
      of cardiovascular risk factors or other degenerative diseases. Clearly, larger
      and better-designed studies of probiotics are necessary, including comparative
      and dose-ranging trials.

TI  - Probiotics in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 260-3
AB  - The demonstration that immune and epithelial cells can discriminate between
      different microbial species has extended our understanding of the actions of
      probiotics beyond simple antimicrobial concepts. Several probiotic mechanisms of 
      action, relative to inflammatory bowel disease, have been elucidated: (1)
      competitive exclusion, whereby probiotics compete with microbial pathogens; (2)
      immunomodulation and/or stimulation of an immune response; (3) antimicrobial
      activity and suppression of pathogen growth; (4) enhancement of barrier activity;
      and (5) induction of T cell apoptosis. The unraveling of these mechanisms of
      action has led to new support for the use of probiotics in the management of
      clinical inflammatory bowel disease. While level 1 evidence now supports the
      therapeutic use of some probiotics in the maintenance treatment of pouchitis,
      only level 2 and 3 evidence are currently available in support of the use of
      probiotics in the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.
      Nevertheless, one significant and consistent finding has emerged over the course 
      of research in the past year: not all probiotic bacteria have similar therapeutic
      effects. Rigorously designed, controlled clinical trials, to investigate the
      unresolved issues related to efficacy, dose, duration of use, single or
      multistrain formulation, and the concomitant use of prebiotics, synbiotics or
      antibiotics, are vital.

TI  - Colonic health: fermentation and short chain fatty acids.
PG  - 235-43
AB  - Interest has been recently rekindled in short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) with the 
      emergence of prebiotics and probiotics aimed at improving colonic and systemic
      health. Dietary carbohydrates, specifically resistant starches and dietary fiber,
      are substrates for fermentation that produce SCFAs, primarily acetate,
      propionate, and butyrate, as end products. The rate and amount of SCFA production
      depends on the species and amounts of microflora present in the colon, the
      substrate source and gut transit time. SCFAs are readily absorbed. Butyrate is
      the major energy source for colonocytes. Propionate is largely taken up by the
      liver. Acetate enters the peripheral circulation to be metabolized by peripheral 
      tissues. Specific SCFA may reduce the risk of developing gastrointestinal
      disorders, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. Acetate is the principal SCFA in
      the colon, and after absorption it has been shown to increase cholesterol
      synthesis. However, propionate, a gluconeogenerator, has been shown to inhibit
      cholesterol synthesis. Therefore, substrates that can decrease the acetate:
      propionate ratio may reduce serum lipids and possibly cardiovascular disease
      risk. Butyrate has been studied for its role in nourishing the colonic mucosa and
      in the prevention of cancer of the colon, by promoting cell differentiation,
      cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis of transformed colonocytes; inhibiting the enzyme
      histone deacetylase and decreasing the transformation of primary to secondary
      bile acids as a result of colonic acidification. Therefore, a greater increase in
      SCFA production and potentially a greater delivery of SCFA, specifically
      butyrate, to the distal colon may result in a protective effect. Butyrate
      irrigation (enema) has also been suggested in the treatment of colitis. More
      human studies are now needed, especially, given the diverse nature of
      carbohydrate substrates and the SCFA patterns resulting from their fermentation. 
      Short-term and long-term human studies are particularly required on SCFAs in
      relation to markers of cancer risk. These studies will be key to the success of
      dietary recommendations to maximize colonic disease prevention.

TI  - Antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.
PG  - 361-72
AB  - Diarrhoea is a common complication of antimicrobial therapy. The term
      antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD) is often considered synonymous with
      Clostridium difficile. In fact, AAD can develop through a variety of mechanisms
      and manifest through a broad range of clinical signs and symptoms. For improved
      prevention and recognition of AAD, it is important to understand the
      pathophysiology and risk factors for AAD. Although Clostridium difficile
      continues to be the most common identifiable pathogen of AAD, many patients with 
      AAD can be managed through a variety of conservative measures. This review
      focuses on some of the important distinctions between nonspecific AAD and
      antibiotic-associated colitis. In addition, the most recent data on important
      risk factors for the development of AAD are summarised. Given its pathogenicity, 
      there will be an emphasis on the early diagnosis, treatment and prevention of
      Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea. AAD is a common clinical problem that
      can progress to severe, life-threatening disease if not recognised quickly.
      Better awareness of risk factors can lead to the most efficacious treatment of
      this disorder: primary prevention.

TI  - Probiotics: their role in the treatment and prevention of disease.
PG  - 261-75
AB  - A probiotic is a "live microbial food ingredients that, when ingested in
      sufficient quantities, exerts health benefits on the consumer". Probiotics exert 
      their benefits through several mechanisms; they prevent colonization, cellular
      adhesion and invasion by pathogenic organisms, they have direct antimicrobial
      activity and they modulate the host immune response. The strongest evidence for
      the clinical effectiveness of probiotics has been in their use for the prevention
      of symptoms of lactose intolerance, treatment of acute diarrhea, attenuation of
      antibiotic-associated gastrointestinal side effects and the prevention and
      treatment of allergy manifestations. More research needs to be carried out to
      clarify conflicting findings on the use of probiotics for prevention of
      travelers' diarrhea, infections in children in daycare and dental caries, and
      elimination of nasal colonization with potentially pathogenic bacteria. Promising
      ongoing research is being conducted on the use of probiotics for the treatment of
      Clostridium difficile colitis, treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection,
      treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and prevention of relapse, treatment of
      irritable bowel syndrome, treatment of intestinal inflammation in cystic fibrosis
      patients, and prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants.
      Finally, areas of future research include the use of probiotics for the treatment
      of rheumatoid arthritis, prevention of cancer and the treatment of
      graft-versus-host disease in bone marrow transplant recipients.

AB  - Prebiotic and probiotic therapies are new strategies being used to treat
      gastrointestinal diseases. Recent evidence suggests that the administration of
      select prebiotics and probiotics, alone or in combination (the latter called
      "synbiotic" therapy) may improve the clinical outcome of patients with ulcerative
      colitis. We report a case of a pediatric ulcerative colitis patient who showed
      increased length of remission, resolution of symptoms, and improved quality of
      life following the administration of synbiotic therapy. The literature supporting
      the use of prebiotic, probiotic, and synbiotic therapies in adult ulcerative
      colitis is also reviewed.

TI  - Diarrhoea in the critically ill.
PG  - 149-54
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to update the knowledge on
      diarrhoea, a common problem in critically ill patients. Epidemiological data will
      be discussed, with special emphasis on diarrhoea in tube-fed patients and during 
      antibiotic therapy. The possible preventive and therapeutic measures will be
      presented. RECENT FINDINGS: The need for concise definitions of diarrhoea was
      recently re-emphasized. The use of pump-driven continuous instead of intermittent
      enteral feeding is less often associated with diarrhoea. The discontinuation of
      enteral feeding during diarrhoea is not justified. Clostridium
      difficile-associated diarrhoea is frequent during antibiotic therapy with
      quinolones and cephalosporins. Formulas enriched with water-soluble fibres are
      probably effective to prevent diarrhoea, and promising data on the modulation of 
      gut microflora with probiotics and prebiotics were recently released. SUMMARY:
      Diarrhoea is common in critically ill patients, especially when sepsis and
      hypoalbuminaemia are present, and during enteral feeding and antibiotic therapy. 
      The management of diarrhoea includes generous hydration, compensation for the
      loss of electrolytes, antidiarrheal oral medications, the continuation of enteral
      feeding, and metronidazole or glycopeptides in the case of moderate to severe C. 
      difficile colitis. The place of enteral formulas enriched with water-soluble
      fibres, probiotics and prebiotics is not yet fully defined.

TI  - Probiotics modulate inflammatory cytokine secretion from inflamed mucosa in
      active ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 284-8
AB  - Enteric microflora of ulcerative colitis patients becomes aberrant. The abnormal 
      interaction between microflora and intestinal mucosal immune system leads the
      mucosal inflammation. Probiotic administration may recover the commensal
      microflora and normalise the host-microbial interaction. In this experiment, we
      cocultured colonic biopsies from active ulcerative colitis patients with
      bifidobacterium to investigate the modulation effect of probiotics on inflamed
      colonic tissues and its possible mechanism. Colonic biopsies from active
      ulcerative colitis were cocultured for 24 h with Bifidobacterium longum. Tumour
      necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-8 in supernatants were measured 
      using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, the biopsies were fixed using paraffin 
      and the expression of NF-kappaB P65 of tissues was studied using
      immunohistochemical staining. The concentrations of TNF-alpha and IL-8 in
      supernatants of tissues cocultured with probiotics were lower than those cultured
      alone. The number of lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) with nuclear
      factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) P65 positive in cocultured tissues was also decreased.
      When cocultured with inflamed tissues of active ulcerative colitis, probiotics
      could inhibit NF-kappaB activation in LPMC and down-regulate inflammatory
      cytokine secretion from inflamed tissues of active ulcerative colitis.

TI  - [Antibiotic-associated diarrhea].
PG  - 193-204
AB  - The incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) differs with the antibiotic
      and varies from 15 - 25 %. Most cases of AAD are directly or indirectly caused by
      alterations of gut microflora by the antibiotics resulting in clinically mild AAD
      cases due to functional disturbances of intestinal carbohydrate or bile acid
      metabolism. Alternatively, changes in the gut flora allow pathogens to
      proliferate. Clostridium difficile is responsible for 10 - 15 % of all cases of
      AAD and almost of all cases of antibiotic-associated pseudomembraneous colitis.
      There is also a growing body of evidence which supports the responsibility of
      Klebsiella oxytoca for the development of antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic
      colitis. Diagnosing Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea should be based
      both on fecal-cytotoxin detection and culture. With respect to specific therapy, 
      metronidazol has become the first choice whereas treatment with oral vancomycin
      should be reserved for patients who have contraindications or intolerance to or
      who have failed to respond to metronidazole. Probiotics such as Sacharomyces
      boulardii can reduce the risk of development. Restrictive antibiotic policies (e.
      g. restricting clindamycin and cephalosporins) and the implementation of a
      comprehensive hospital infection control have also been shown to be effective in 
      reducing the incidence of AAD.

TI  - Bacterial and fungal microbiota in relation to probiotic therapy (VSL#3) in
      pouchitis.
PG  - 833-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: The intestinal microbiota plays a critical role in the
      pathophysiology of pouchitis, a major complication after ileal pouch anal
      anastomosis in patients with ulcerative colitis. Recently, controlled trials have
      demonstrated that probiotics are effective in maintenance of remission in
      pouchitis patients. However, the mechanism by which therapy with probiotics works
      remains elusive. This study explores the role of the bacterial and fungal flora
      in a controlled trial for maintenance of remission in pouchitis patients with the
      probiotic VSL#3 compound. METHODS: The mucosa associated pouch microbiota was
      investigated before and after therapy with VSL#3 by analysis of endoscopic
      biopsies using ribosomal DNA/RNA based community fingerprint analysis, clone
      libraries, real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and fluorescence in situ
      hybridisation. Patients were recruited from a placebo controlled remission
      maintenance trial with VSL#3. RESULTS: Patients who developed pouchitis while
      treated with placebo had low bacterial and high fungal diversity. Bacterial
      diversity was increased and fungal diversity was reduced in patients in remission
      maintained with VSL#3 (p = 0.001). Real time PCR experiments demonstrated that
      VSL#3 increased the total number of bacterial cells (p = 0.002) and modified the 
      spectrum of bacteria towards anaerobic species. Taxa specific clone libraries for
      Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria showed that the richness and spectrum of these
      bacteria were altered under probiotic therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotic therapy
      with VSL#3 increases the total number of intestinal bacterial cells as well as
      the richness and diversity of the bacterial microbiota, especially the anaerobic 
      flora. The diversity of the fungal flora is repressed. Restoration of the
      integrity of a "protective" intestinal mucosa related microbiota could therefore 
      be a potential mechanism of probiotic bacteria in inflammatory barrier diseases
      of the lower gastrointestinal tract.

TI  - Anti-inflammatory effect of Lactobacillus casei on Shigella-infected human
      intestinal epithelial cells.
PG  - 1228-37
AB  - Shigella invades the human intestinal mucosa, thus causing bacillary dysentery,
      an acute recto-colitis responsible for lethal complications, mostly in infants
      and toddlers. Conversely, commensal bacteria live in a mutualistic relationship
      with the intestinal mucosa that is characterized by homeostatic control of innate
      responses, thereby contributing to tolerance to the flora. Cross-talk established
      between commensals and the intestinal epithelium mediate this active process, the
      mechanisms of which remain largely uncharacterized. Probiotics such as
      Lactobacillus casei belong to a subclass of these commensals that modulate
      mucosal innate responses and possibly display anti-inflammatory properties. We
      analyzed whether L. casei could attenuate the pro-inflammatory signaling induced 
      by Shigella flexneri after invasion of the epithelial lining. Cultured epithelial
      cells were infected with L. casei, followed by a challenge with S. flexneri.
      Using macroarray DNA chips, we observed that L. casei down-regulated the
      transcription of a number of genes encoding pro-inflammatory effectors such as
      cytokines and chemokines and adherence molecules induced by invasive S. flexneri.
      This resulted in an anti-inflammatory effect that appeared mediated by the
      inhibition of the NF-kappaB pathway, particularly through stabilization of
      I-kappaBalpha. In a time-course experiment using GeneChip hybridization analysis,
      the expression of many genes involved in ubiquitination and proteasome processes 
      were modulated during L. casei treatment. Thus, L. casei has developed a
      sophisticated means to maintain intestinal homeostasis through a process that
      involves manipulation of the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway upstream of
      I-kappaBalpha.

TI  - Probiotics. Some evidence of their effectiveness.
PG  - 1487-93
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define the term probiotics, to indicate how to identify products
      that have been proven beneficial, and to assess the quality of evidence regarding
      probiotics. QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: A few level I studies support the effectiveness 
      of specific probiotics for certain diagnoses. For most so-called probiotics,
      however, weak or no evidence supports their effectiveness. MAIN MESSAGE:
      Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts,
      confer a health benefit on the host. Level I evidence supports use of VSL#3 for
      maintaining remission of inflammatory colitis. Probiotics for treating vaginal
      infections, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14, have
      level I evidence of effectiveness, but are not available in Canada. Specific
      probiotics taken for certain indications improve health and have few side
      effects. CONCLUSION: Limited but good evidence supports the role of certain
      probiotics in medical practice. Because consumer pressure will undoubtedly
      stimulate further interest in probiotics, family doctors need to be informed
      about them so they can advise their patients appropriately.

PG  - 492-9
AB  - Approximately 10% to 30% of patients with ulcerative colitis and up to 70% of
      patients with Crohn's disease will undergo surgery at some point during their
      lifetime. Although patients with ulcerative colitis are considered "cured" by
      surgery, patients who have undergone an ileal pouch anal anastomosis may develop 
      pouchitis, cuffitis, pouch irritability, or even Crohn's disease. Various
      therapies have shown success, including probiotics, in the prevention of
      pouchitis onset or relapse. Crohn's disease historically recurs following
      surgery; prophylaxis against disease recurrence has been attempted with a variety
      of agents, with variable success. Innovative therapies holding promise for the
      future treatment or prevention of these conditions are under exploration.

TI  - Positioning novel biologic, probiotic, and apheresis therapies for Crohn's
      disease and ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 485-91
AB  - Traditional medications for inflammatory bowel disease are small molecule drugs, 
      most of which were developed for use in other diseases before being found to be
      efficacious for the treatment of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. Recently,
      several exciting alternative approaches to the medical treatment of inflammatory 
      bowel disease have been developed. These include biologic, probiotic, and
      apheresis therapies that offer certain advantages over traditional drug therapy
      for inflammatory bowel disease. The purpose of this review is to assess the
      current state of knowledge about novel biologic, probiotic, and apheresis
      therapies and to analyze how best to incorporate these therapies into evolving
      management paradigms of inflammatory bowel disease.

AB  - Advances (from 2004 to 2006) in the use of conventional agents include the
      molecular mechanisms of action, which have implications for monitoring
      (azathioprine and thioguanosine triphosphate) and chemoprevention (mesalamine and
      peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma). Advances in biotherapy include
      new data on monoclonal antibodies (infliximab in ulcerative colitis, adalimumab, 
      certolizumab pegol, fontolizumab, selective anti-adhesion molecules, and others),
      antisense oligonucleotides, the development of small molecules, and cell-gene
      therapy (including helminth ova, leukocytapheresis, stem cell transplantation,
      and probiotic intestinal mucosal delivery systems). However, management of
      inflammatory bowel disease is about more than drug therapy, dose, and timing. The
      goals remain induction of remission, limitation of side effects, modification of 
      the pattern of disease, and avoidance of complications. With the cost and
      complexity of biotherapy, inflammatory bowel disease is emerging as a specific
      subspecialty.

TI  - Probiotics in arthralgia and spondyloarthropathies in patients with inflammatory 
      bowel disease. Prospective randomized trials are necessary.
PG  - 570-4
AB  - Arthralgias and spondyloarthropathies of the peripheral and axial joints are
      common in inflammatory bowel disease. Evidence for a strong association between
      these clinical manifestations and diseases of the joints has been provided by
      several clinical and epidemiological studies. Immunological studies have shown
      the presence of shared inflammatory cells both in the gut and the synovium in
      spondyloarthropathies. Genetic factors play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of
      spondyloarthropathies and inflammatory bowel disease. The role of the ubiquitous 
      bacterial flora and pathogenic microorganisms present in the intestinal lumen may
      induce these joint diseases in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. In this 
      review we will focus on the pathogenesis of spondyloarthropathies and arthralgia 
      in patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease. Based on preliminary
      clinical observations in patients with arthralgia and IBD, we put forward the
      hypothesis that probiotics may be helpful in the management of common
      extraintestinal manifestations such as arthralgia in patients with ulcerative
      colitis and Crohn's disease.

TI  - Bifidogenic growth stimulator for the treatment of active ulcerative colitis: a
      pilot study.
PG  - 76-81
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Experimental studies have shown that luminal antigens are involved in
      chronic intestinal inflammatory disorders. Bifidogenic growth stimulator (BGS) is
      a prebiotic preparation produced by Propionibacterium freudenreichii isolated
      from Swiss cheese. Previously BGS was shown to act in the colon as a growth
      stimulator of Bifidobacteria. This study investigated the efficacy and safety of 
      BGS in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Twelve patients with mildly 
      to moderately active ulcerative colitis received orally 4.5 g of BGS daily for 4 
      wk in an open-label treatment protocol while the baseline anti-inflammatory
      therapy was continued. The response to treatment was evaluated clinically and
      endoscopically. Concentrations of short-chain fatty acids and the composition of 
      commensal bacteria, including Bifidobacteria, Enterobacteria and Bacteroides
      species, were studied in stool samples. RESULTS: Patients showed improvement in
      their clinical activity index scores, with a significant decrease in the score
      from 7.4 +/- 2.8 to 4.7 +/- 1.5 (mean +/- standard error of the mean, P < 0.01). 
      The endoscopic index score decreased from 4.4 +/- 1.7 to 2.8 +/- 1.8 (P < 0.05)
      with treatment. Patients showed an increase in stool butyrate concentrations
      after BGS treatment (P < 0.05). There were no significant changes in stool levels
      of bacteria as a result of BGS treatment. No side effects related to BGS were
      observed. CONCLUSIONS: Oral BGS therapy may represent a non-toxic way to treat
      ulcerative colitis. However, controlled studies are needed to demonstrate its
      efficacy in the treatment of this disorder.

TI  - Correlation of probiotic Lactobacillus salivarius growth phase with its cell
      wall-associated proteome.
PG  - 153-9
AB  - Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salivarius UCC118 is a probiotic bacterium that
      was originally isolated from human intestinal tissues and was subsequently shown 
      in a pilot study to alleviate symptoms associated with mild-moderate Crohn's
      disease. Strain UCC118 can adhere to animal and human intestinal tissue, and to
      both healthy and inflamed ulcerative colitis mucosa, irrespective of location in 
      the gut. In this study, an enzymatic technique has been combined with proteomic
      analysis to correlate bacterial growth phase with the presence of factors present
      in the cell wall of the bacterium. Using PAGE electrophoresis, it was determined 
      that progression from lag to log to stationary growth phases in vitro correlated 
      with increasing prominence of an 84kD protein associated with in vitro adherence 
      ability. Isolated proteins from the 84kD band region were further separated by
      two-dimensional electrophoresis, resolving this band into 20 individual protein
      spots at differing isoelectric points. The protein moieties were excised, trypsin
      digested and subjected to tandem mass spectrometry. The observed proteins are
      analogous to those reported to be associated with the Listeria monocytogenes
      cell-wall proteome, and include DnaK, Ef-Ts and pyruvate kinase. These data
      suggest that at least some of the beneficial attributes of probiotic
      lactobacilli, and in particular this strain, may be due to nonpathogenic mimicry 
      of pathogens and potentially be mediated through a form of attenuated virulence.

TI  - Probiotics (VSL#3) in arthralgia in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's 
      disease: a pilot study.
PG  - 453-9
AB  - Arthralgia is a common extraintestinal manifestation of inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). Alterations of the immunologic regulation in the gut may
      contribute to the pathogenesis of arthralgia. Probiotics (VSL#3) have proven
      effective in the treatment of pouchitis in patients with ileal pouch anal
      anastomosis after panproctocolectomy for ulcerative colitis both in maintaining
      remission and in preventing a flare-up without side effects. The aim of this
      study was to determine the safety and efficacy of VSL#3 in patients with
      quiescent IBD who suffered from arthralgia for more than two weeks. An open-label
      trial was conducted using VSL#3. Pre- and post-treatment joint pain intensity
      were measured on the Ritchie Articular Index and visual analog scale. Disease
      activity of the bowel was assessed by the Truelove-Witts and the Harvey-Bradshaw 
      scores. Sixteen of 29 patients completed the trial; in 10 of the 16 patients a
      statistically significant improvement was documented by the Ritchie Articular
      Index. No one of the patients had a relapse of intestinal disease while on
      probiotics. These preliminary results suggest that the probiotic mixture VSL#3
      may be an alternative treatment for arthralgia in patients with IBD without
      inducing exacerbation of the disease. Because probiotics may be effective in the 
      treatment of IBD as well, our results suggest that patients with active disease
      and arthralgia may also derive benefit from this treatment. Proper randomized
      controlled studies are indicated.

TI  - Functional diarrhea.
PG  - 350-7
AB  - Functional diarrhea occurs as part of the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and as
      an isolated symptom as functional (painless) diarrhea. Progress has been made in 
      defining these disorders and in identifying new mechanisms involved in symptom
      production. A strong link exists between intestinal infection and IBS, as is the 
      role of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). The importance of persistent subclinical
      inflammation is also emerging as a potential etiologic factor, particularly in
      post-infectious IBS. Although changes in the bacterial flora and bacterial
      overgrowth have been put forward as additional new contributors to symptom
      production, the case is not strong. These developments in pathogenesis have
      facilitated the introduction of new therapies. 5-HT(3) antagonists reduce bowel
      frequency and pain in women with diarrhea-predominant IBS, but their use is
      limited because of ischemic colitis. Prednisolone lacks efficacy, and early
      results with probiotics and herbal remedies are encouraging but require
      confirmation by larger trials.

TI  - Occurrence of virulence factors among human intestinal enterococcal isolates.
PG  - 341-4
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of enterococcal
      virulence factors among human intestinal Enterococcus faecalis strains and to
      find out whether the pattern differs from that seen in published reports on food 
      and clinical isolates. METHODS AND RESULTS: The E. faecalis isolates were
      cultured from human faecal samples obtained from five ulcerative colitis patients
      in remission phase. The species identification was based on API120 strips and
      species-specific PCR primers. The isolates were further characterized using the
      pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The presence of seven different known
      enterococcal virulence factors among the confirmed E. faecalis isolates were
      screened using PCR techniques and published primers. CONCLUSIONS: Among the 35
      isolates representing nine different pulsotypes the most frequent virulence
      factors were cpd (33 isolates), agg (25 isolates), gelE (22 isolates) and esp (15
      isolates). No complete sets of genes associated for the production of functional 
      cytolysin were encountered indicating that intestinal enterococci may differ in
      this respect from clinical strains. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY:
      According to the results, the commensal enterococcal strains appear to differ
      from clinical isolates in their complement of presumed virulence factors.

TI  - Prescript-Assist probiotic-prebiotic treatment for irritable bowel syndrome: a
      methodologically oriented, 2-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind
      clinical study.
PG  - 755-61
AB  - BACKGROUND: The symptomatic efficacy of Prescript-Assist (Safer Medical, Inc.,
      Fort Benton, Montana), a treatment combining probiotic and prebiotic components, 
      has previously been evaluated clinically only in an open-label study in patients 
      with various gastrointestinal conditions, including irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS). OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted primarily to compare the effects of
      Prescript-Assist with placebo in patients with a diagnosis of IBS. Toward this
      objective, a secondary methodologic goal was to determine the number and nature
      of symptom clusters ("subsyndromic factors") that characterize IBS. METHODS: This
      was a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study in which patients were
      randomly assigned to receive either Prescript-Assist one 500-mg capsule BID or 1 
      placebo capsule BID for 2 weeks. Thirteen IBS symptoms identified from the
      clinical literature were embedded in a larger research instrument. Using a scale 
      from 0 to 5, patients rated the intensity of these symptoms for the 7-day period 
      immediately before the start of treatment, at the end of each study week, and
      after each of the 2 subsequent weeks (during which all patients received
      open-label Prescript-Assist as part of a larger study evaluating methodologic
      approaches to enhancing assessments of medication efficacy/safety). The
      symptom-intensity data were subjected to maximum likelihood factor analysis with 
      varimax rotation to identify any IBS subsyndromic factors, and the effect of
      treatment on each of the identified factors was evaluated using analyses of
      covariance with appropriate baseline-week assessments as covariate controls.
      RESULTS: The study included 25 patients with IBS (23 women, 2 men; age range,
      20-70 years). Three subsyndromic factors were identified that together accounted 
      for 60.2% of total IBS symptom variance: factor 1, general ill feelings/nausea;
      factor 2, indigestion/flatulence; and factor 3, colitis. Treatment with
      Prescript-Assist was associated with significant reductions in each of the
      subsyndromic factors. Factor 1 was significantly reduced by 0.345 standard score 
      units (F(1,46) = 4.26; P = 0.042), factor 2 by 0.544 standard score units
      (F(1,46) = 7.83; P = 0.008), and factor 3 by 0.826 standard score units (F(1,46) 
      = 10.20; P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: This study identified 3 subsyndromic factors of
      IBS: general ill feelings/nausea, indigestion/flatulence, and colitis. In this
      methodologically oriented double-blind study in patients with IBS, combined
      probiotic-prebiotic treatment with Prescript-Assist was associated with
      significant reductions in these factors.

TI  - Use of a probiotic to decrease enteric hyperoxaluria.
PG  - 1244-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease have a 10- to 100-fold
      increased risk of nephrolithiasis, with enteric hyperoxaluria being the major
      risk factor for these and other patients with fat malabsorptive states.
      Endogenous components of the intestinal microflora can potentially limit dietary 
      oxalate absorption. METHODS: Ten patients were studied with chronic fat
      malabsorption, calcium oxalate stones, and hyperoxaluria thought to be caused by 
      jejunoileal bypass (1) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery for obesity (4),
      dumping syndrome secondary to gastrectomy (2), celiac sprue (1), chronic
      pancreatitis (1), and ulcerative colitis in remission (1). For 3 months, patients
      received increasing doses of a lactic acid bacteria mixture (Oxadrop), VSL
      Pharmaceuticals), followed by a washout month. Twenty-four-hour urine collections
      were performed at baseline and after each month. RESULTS: Mean urinary oxalate
      excretion fell by 19% after 1 month (1 dose per day, P < 0.05), and oxalate
      excretion remained reduced by 24% during the second month (2 doses per day, P <
      0.05). During the third month on 3 doses per day oxalate excretion increased
      slightly, so that the mean was close to the baseline established off treatment.
      Urinary oxalate again fell 20% from baseline during the washout period. Calcium
      oxalate supersaturation was reduced while on Oxadrop, largely due to the decrease
      in oxalate excretion, although mean changes did not reach statistical
      significance. CONCLUSION: Manipulation of gastrointestinal (GI) flora can
      influence urinary oxalate excretion to reduce urinary supersaturation levels.
      These changes could have a salutary effect on stone formation rates. Further
      studies will be needed to establish the optimal dosing regimen.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review reports on the recent progress understanding
      mechanisms of action and clinical applications of probiotics. RECENT FINDINGS:
      New insights on regulating mechanisms of intestinal commensal bacteria to prevent
      and treat different gastrointestinal diseases have been reported. Some
      probiotics, though not all, exert beneficial effects by modulating the mucosal
      barrier function and immune activity. It seems that a combination of different
      probiotics is more effective than a single strain. It was demonstrated that not
      only viable bacteria administered to the intestinal tract but also isolated
      probiotic DNA is active, even if injected subcutaneously. There is reasonable
      evidence to recommend probiotics in infectious diarrhoea for prevention and
      treatment (mainly in children) and to prevent antibiotic-induced gastrointestinal
      side effects. Furthermore, probiotics are effective in maintaining remission in
      ulcerative colitis and preventing and treating pouchitis. Promising positive
      effects were published in major surgery patients (gastric resection, pancreatic
      resection, liver transplantation) and in severe necrotising acute pancreatitis.
      SUMMARY: Increasing knowledge on probiotics is exciting, but in the near future
      it must be defined which probiotics (single strains or a combination) are most
      effective in specific diseases. Well-designed, randomized clinical trials are
      still required to further define the role of probiotics as preventive and
      therapeutic agents.

TI  - Update in medical therapy of ulcerative colitis: newer concepts and therapies.
PG  - 557-69
AB  - Recent advances in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis recognize the interface
      of genetic susceptibility, environmental factors (eg, gut microflora), and an
      altered host's immune response. The meteoric evolution of new therapies designed 
      to address these pathogenetic factors may lead to confusing and often confounding
      treatment programs. This review is designed to assist the practitioner when in
      [corrected] incorporating new or novel therapies into a treatment program. These

TI  - VSL#3 probiotic-mixture induces remission in patients with active ulcerative
      colitis.
PG  - 1539-46
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Intestinal bacteria have been implicated in the initiation
      and perpetuation of IBD; in contrast, "probiotic bacteria" have properties
      possibly effective in treating and preventing relapse of IBD. We evaluated the
      safety and efficacy of VSL#3 and the components, and the composition of the
      biopsy-associated microbiota in patients with active mild to moderate ulcerative 
      colitis (UC). METHODS: Thirty-four ambulatory patients with active UC received
      open label VSL#3, 3,600 billion bacteria daily in two divided doses for 6 wk. The
      presence of biopsy-associated bacteria was detected using a nucleic acid-based
      method and the presence of VSL#3 species confirmed by DNA sequencing of 16S rRNA.
      RESULTS: Thirty-two patients completed 6 wk of VSL#3 treatment and 2 patients did
      not have the final endoscopic assessment. Intent to treat analysis demonstrated
      remission (UCDAI < or = 2) in 53% (n = 18); response (decrease in UCDAI > or = 3,
      but final score > or =3) in 24% (n = 8); no response in 9% (n = 3); worsening in 
      9% (n = 3); and failure to complete the final sigmoidoscopy assessment in 5% (n =
      2). There were no biochemical or clinical adverse events related to VSL#3. Two of
      the components of VSL#3 were detected by PCR/DGGE in biopsies collected from 3
      patients in remission. CONCLUSION: Treatment of patients with mild to moderate
      UC, not responding to conventional therapy, with VSL#3 resulted in a combined
      induction of remission/response rate of 77% with no adverse events. At least some
      of the bacterial species incorporated in the probiotic product reached the target
      site in amounts that could be detected.

TI  - Human defensins in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 42-54
AB  - Crohn's disease, a transmural inflammation of the gut, has been linked to good
      childhood hygiene, frequent use of antibiotics before diagnosis, adherent or
      invasive mucosal bacteria and a break in the tolerance of luminal bacteria. A
      decrease or lack of mucosal peptide antibiotics may play a central role in the
      etiopathogenesis of Crohn's disease. The dysregulated adaptive immune system may 
      reflect only the primary break of the mucosal defence since the immune response
      is mostly directed against luminal bacteria. Crohn's disease patients with ileal 
      involvement, as compared to controls and Crohn's disease patients without ileal
      disease, are characterized by a diminished expression of the ileal Paneth cell
      defensins. This decrease is even more pronounced in Crohn's disease patients with
      a mutation in the NOD2 gene, which is associated with Crohn's disease and ileal
      involvement. NOD2 is an intracellular peptidoglycan receptor and is expressed in 
      Paneth cells. In contrast to ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease of the colon is 
      characterized by an impaired induction of human beta defensins 2 and 3. The
      hypothesis of an impaired mucosal antibacterial activity is also consistent with 
      the benefit from antibiotic or probiotic treatment in certain disease states.

TI  - [Pouchitis treatment by probiotics].
PG  - 63-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to review the principal effects of
      probiotics on pouchitis and identify their mechanisms of action. METHODS: The
      study was based on a review of all relevant studies published in the literature
      on the effects of probiotics in pouchitis and their possible mechanisms of
      action. RESULTS: Pouchitis is the major long-term complication after ileal pouch 
      anal anstomosis for ulcerative colitis. The cause is still unknown but is likely 
      to be multifactorial. An imbalance in the usual fecal flora was recently
      suggested. Most patients with symptoms of pouchitis respond promptly to
      antibiotics. However, 5-10% of them develop rapidly relapsing symptoms that
      required protacted therapy. Porbiotics are living microorganisms that ingested in
      adequate amounts exert beneficial effects. Promising results have been obtained
      with probiotics mainly in maintenance of remission of chronic pouchitis and also 
      as induction of remission. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that restoring the
      microbial imbalance may offer an effective therapeutic alternative to patients
      with pouchitis.

TI  - Probiotic Lactobacillus-induced improvement in murine chronic inflammatory bowel 
      disease is associated with the down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in
      lamina propria mononuclear cells.
PG  - 417-26
AB  - IL-6/STAT-3 signals play key roles in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is
      known that Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota (LcS) improves inflammatory
      disorders. This study aimed to elucidate the effect of LcS on murine chronic IBD 
      and to clarify the mechanism. We focused the inhibitory effect of LcS on the
      production of IL-6 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated large intestinal lamina
      propria mononuclear cells (LI-LPMC) isolated from mice with chronic colitis and
      in RAW264.7 cells in vitro. We also determined in vivo the effect of LcS on
      murine chronic IBD models induced with dextran sodium sulphate and SAMP1/Yit
      mice. Finally, we examined the cellular determinants of LcS for the
      down-regulation of IL-6 secretion by LI-LPMC, RAW264.7 cells and peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) derived from patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). LcS,
      but not other strains of Lactobacillus, inhibited the production of IL-6 in
      LPS-stimulated LI-LPMC and RAW264.7 cells, down-regulating the nuclear
      translocation of NF-kappaB. The LcS-diet-improved murine chronic colitis is
      associated with the reduction of IL-6 synthesis by LI-LPMC. LcS also improved
      chronic ileitis in SAMP1/Yit mice. The release of IL-6 in vitro in LPS-stimulated
      LI-LPMC, RAW 264.7 cells and UC-PBMC was inhibited by a
      polysaccharide-peptidoglycan complex (PSPG) derived from LcS. This
      probiotic-induced improvement in murine chronic inflammatory bowel disease is
      associated with the down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6
      and IFN-gamma production in LPMC. Therefore, LcS may be a useful probiotic for
      the treatment of human inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease: possible mechanisms of action.
PG  - 426-30
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Probiotics are live, nonpathogenic bacteria that confer health
      benefits beyond their nutritional value. In inflammatory bowel disease, where
      changes in bacterial flora have been demonstrated, there is an increasing
      interest in modulating the flora with probiotic strains. The beneficial effect of
      probiotics is demonstrated mainly in pouchitis and ulcerative colitis; however,
      their mechanisms of action are not well defined. The purpose of this review is to
      discuss the latest findings related to their mechanism of action. RECENT
      FINDINGS: A decrease in the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IFN-gamma,
      TNF-alpha and IL-12, and interference with bacterial adherence to the epithelium 
      has been demonstrated. At the molecular level, an anti-inflammatory effect
      associated with NF-kappaB inhibition, heat-shock protein induction and proteasome
      inhibition has been suggested, although NF-kappaB induction has also been
      demonstrated. Unexpectedly, the beneficial effects described were achieved not
      only by live bacteria but also by gamma-irradiated nonviable bacteria, bacterial 
      DNA components and probiotic-cultured media. SUMMARY: Understanding the
      mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effect of probiotics in inflammatory
      bowel disease and experimental colitis may help understand the role of bacteria
      in disease pathogenesis. The findings that live probiotics may not be mandatory
      to be beneficial, and that therapeutic effects may be obtained by systemic,
      rather than oral administration could have a major impact on the practical use
      and manufacturing of probiotics.

AB  - The pathogenic role of certain microorganism of intestinal flora has been
      demonstrated in experimental colitis in animals and strongly suspected in
      inflammatory bowel disease in human, especially in Crohn's disease and pouchitis.
      Probiotics are living non pathogenic microorganisms that, upon oral ingestion
      exert benefits on human health by modulating enteric flora or by stimulation of
      local immune system. The aim of this article is to remind the role of intestinal 
      flora in inflammatory bowel disease, the mechanism of inflammation induced by
      this flora and to review through the literature, the different clinical studies
      performed with probiotics in human.

AB  - Pouchitis is a common and long-term complication of ileal pouch-anal anastomosis 
      in patients with underlying ulcerative colitis. Combination with clinical
      symptoms, endoscopic and histopathological findings are required to make accurate
      diagnosis. Ciprofloxacin and metronidazole are effective in patients with acute
      pouchitis. Probiotics may be useful in maintaining regression and preventing from
      remission. Immunomodulating agents are also useful in chronic pouchitis.

AB  - Although the causes of inflammatory bowel disease including ulcerative colitis
      and Crohn's disease remain incompletely understood, increasing evidence
      implicates intestinal microflora in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Therefore,
      modulation of microflora with probiotics or prebiotics may offer a plausible
      therapeutic approach. While recent data support a potential therapeutic efficacy,
      such treatments need to be further assessed by large scale studies. A better
      understanding of the intestinal microflora and the mechanisms of their action may
      help us to develop more effective treatment for inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Mucosal bacteria in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - S67-72
AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an acute and chronic inflammatory bowel disease of
      unknown aetiology, although bacterial species belonging to the normal colonic
      microbiota are known to be involved in its initiation and maintenance. Several
      organisms have been linked to the disease; however, mucosa-associated bacteria
      are more likely to be involved than their luminal counterparts, due to their
      close proximity to the host epithelium. Comparative bacteriological analyses were
      done on rectal biopsies to investigate differences in mucosal bacteria in
      patients with UC and healthy controls. Complex bacterial communities were found
      in both groups, with significant reductions in bifidobacterial numbers in UC,
      which suggested that they might have a protective role in the disease.
      Accordingly, a therapy for treating UC was designed, with the aim of modifying
      the mucosal microbiota to increase bifidobacterial colonisation and reduce
      inflammation. Ranges of mucosal and faecal bifidobacteria were tested for their
      substrate preferences and their abilities to survive under a variety of
      environmental conditions. A synbiotic comprising a probiotic (Bifidobacterium
      longum) isolated from healthy rectal mucosa combined with a prebiotic
      (oligofructose-enriched inulin - Synergy 1) was developed. The treatment was used
      in a randomised controlled trial involving eighteen patients with active UC, for 
      a period of 1 month. Rectal biopsies were collected at the beginning and end of
      the study. Bacteriological analysis and transcription levels of
      epithelium-related immune markers were assessed. Results demonstrated that
      short-term synbiotic treatment resulted in increased bifidobacterial colonisation
      of the rectal mucosa and induced significant reductions in the expression of
      molecules that control inflammation in active UC.

TI  - Inulin and oligofructose: impact on intestinal diseases and disorders.
PG  - S61-5
AB  - A large and diverse variety of bacteria have evolved and adapted to live in the
      human intestinal habitat in a symbiotic arrangement that influences both
      physiology and pathology in the host. Symbiosis between host and flora can be
      optimised by prebiotics. Inulin-type fructans have been shown to improve the
      metabolic functions of the commensal flora. Clinical and experimental data
      suggest that they also improve the gut mucosal barrier. Furthermore, modulation
      of the trophic functions of the flora by these prebiotics could help in the
      prevention of inflammatory bowel diseases. The anti-inflammatory effects of
      inulin or oligofructose have been assessed in the rat model of distal colitis
      induced by dextran sodium sulphate, which histologically resembles human
      ulcerative colitis, and in the trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid model that
      resembles human Crohn's disease. Both inulin and oligofructose stimulate colonic 
      production of SCFA and favour the growth of indigenous lactobacilli and/or
      bifidobacteria. These effects are associated with reduced mucosal inflammation
      and decreased mucosal lesion scores. Inulin has also been tested in a
      placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with relapsing pouchitis. Treatment
      reduced endoscopic and histological parameters of inflammation of the pouch
      mucosa. Inulin and oligofructose may offer an opportunity to prevent chronic
      inflammatory intestinal disorders, and this potential should be tested in further
      clinical studies.

TI  - [Probiotics as therapeutic agents in irritable bowel syndrome].
PG  - 467-71
AB  - Probiotics are defined as living micro-organisms which, when administered in
      large amounts, confer a health benefit on the host. The use of probiotics in the 
      therapy of infectious bowel diseases as well as maintaining remission of
      ulcerative colitis and in pouchitis is evidence-based. Also, in several studies
      proof could be supplied that specific probiotics relieve the symptoms and the
      course of irritable bowel syndrome. Some trials showed a significant improvement 
      of irritable bowel syndrome-related constipation via Lactobacillus casei Shirota 
      and E. coli Nissle 1917. Lactobacillus plantarum has been proven effective in
      reducing pain and abdominal bloating. However, in most of the studies rather
      small numbers of patients were examined. Furthermore, these studies do not always
      closely follow scientific standards (randomised, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled). Therefore, confirmatory studies are necessary to examine the
      effect of probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome.

TI  - Probiotic therapy in the prevention of pouchitis onset: decreased
      interleukin-1beta, interleukin-8, and interferon-gamma gene expression.
PG  - 447-54
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotic therapy has been shown to prevent the onset of pouchitis
      and to improve the quality of life in ulcerative colitis patients who required
      ileal pouch anal anastomosis. Pouchitis has been associated with elevated levels 
      of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. METHODS: In this retrospective
      analysis of archived endoscopic samples from responding patients enrolled in the 
      above-mentioned trial, we were interested in studying mucosal gene expression of 
      the pleiotropic proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6), TH1
      cytokines (interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-12),
      regulatory cytokines (interleukin-10, transforming growth factor-beta), and the
      chemokine interleukin-8. In addition to assessment of cytokine gene expression,
      the presence of polymorphonuclear cells in the mucosal tissue was evaluated.
      RESULTS: Data show that patients who were treated with probiotics had significant
      lower mucosal mRNA expression levels of interleukin-1beta, interleukin-8, and
      interferon-gamma compared with placebo-treated patients. In addition, a lower
      number of polymorphonuclear cells was present in the tissue of patients within
      the probiotic group compared with the number of polymorphonuclear cells in the
      tissue of patients receiving placebo and patients having an episode of pouchitis.
      CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that probiotic treatment regulates the mucosal
      immune response by reducing mucosal levels of neutrophil-chemoattractant IL-8 and
      tissue influx of polymorphonuclear cells, and may further act by inhibition of
      T-cell activation, by reinforcement of barrier function and by a tight control of
      the potent pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1beta.

TI  - Antibiotic-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis: are they less common
      with poorly absorbed antimicrobials?
PG  - 81-9
AB  - Diarrhea is a well-known complication of antibiotic therapy. Rates of
      antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) vary from 5 to 25%. Some antibiotics are
      more likely to cause diarrhea than others, specifically, those that are broad
      spectrum and those that target anaerobic flora. This paper reviews the effects of
      antibiotics on the fecal flora as well as host factors which contribute to AAD.
      Clinical features and treatment of AAD are also described. Prevention of AAD
      rests on wise antibiotic policies, the use of probiotics and prevention of
      acquisition in the hospital setting. Data from clinical trials suggest that
      poorly absorbed antimicrobials might have a decreased risk of causing AAD and
      Clostridium difficile-associated disease, as concluded from studies of
      antibiotics used for preoperative bowel decontamination and poorly absorbed
      antibiotics used for traveler's diarrhea. Controlled trials would prove this but 
      are not yet available. Probiotics may be a good adjunct to poorly absorbed
      antibiotics to minimize the risk of diarrhea associated with antibiotics.

      on with ileal-pouch-anal-anastomosis (IPAA). A disturbed microecology in the
      pouch has been suggested as one possible explanation. In a previous double-blind,
      randomized, controlled study we demonstrated clinical improvement of symptoms in 
      patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) operated on with IPAA, during intervention 
      with live probiotic microbes Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteriae. The aim of the
      present study was to confirm our previous results in a much larger material,
      including clinical symptoms, faecal flora and endoscopic evaluation, and to
      compare the results in UC/IPAA patients with those of patients with familial
      adenomatous polyposis (FAP) with IPAA and UC patients with ileorectal anastomosis
      (IRA). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Five hundred millilitres of a fermented milk product
      (Cultura) containing live lactobacilli (La-5) and bifidobacteriae (Bb-12) was
      given daily for 4 weeks to 51 UC patients and 10 patients with FAP, operated on
      with IPAA, and six UC patients operated on for IRA. Stool samples were cultured
      for examination of lactobacilli, bifidobacteriae, fungi and pH before, during and
      after intervention. Before, during and after intervention, endoscopic evaluation 
      was performed. Categorized symptomatology was examined prospectively using diary 
      cards in addition to an interview, before and on the last day of intervention.
      RESULTS: The number of lactobacilli and bifidobacteriae increased significantly
      during intervention in the UC patients operated on with IPAA and remained
      significantly increased one week after intervention. Involuntary defecation,
      leakage, abdominal cramps and the need for napkins (category I), faecal number
      and consistency (category II) and mucus and urge to evacuate stools (category
      III) were significantly decreased during intervention in the UC/IPAA group. In
      the FAP group there was a significant decrease in faecal leakage, abdominal
      cramps and use of napkins (category I) during intervention. The median endoscopic
      score of inflammation was significantly decreased during intervention in the
      UC/IPAA patients. Blood tests, faecal fungi and faecal pH did not change
      significantly during intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this extended study,
      showing an effect of probiotics on symptoms and endoscopic inflammation in UC
      patients operated on with IPAA confirm our previously reported effect of
      probiotics on clinical symptoms and endoscopic score in a smaller, double-blind, 
      randomized, controlled study. The significantly higher response to probiotics in 
      families with increased risk of IBD will have to be repeated in future studies.

TI  - The beneficial effects of microflora, especially obligate anaerobes, and their
      products on the colonic environment in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1047-53
AB  - Because intestinal microflora play a pivotal role in the development of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), there is currently some interest in alternating
      the composition of the microflora toward a potentially more remedial community.
      This paper summarizes the clinical and experimental efficacy of the manipulation 
      of microflora by the use of antibiotics, probiotics, and prebiotics in IBD.
      Germinated barley foodstuff (GBF) is a prebiotic whose unique characteristics
      make it highly suitable for applications in IBD. It also helps prolong remission 
      in remissive ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and also attenuates clinical
      activity in non-remissive UC patients. GBF has shown to be converted into a
      preferential nutrient, butyrate, for colonocytes through the action of
      Eubacterium and Bifidobacterium, and this bacterial butyrate can provide
      anti-inflammatory effects. The probiotic approaches for IBD include VSL#3,
      Nissle1917, Clostridium butyricum, and Bifidobacterium-fermented milk. In this
      paper, we summarize the distinctive role of another probiotic, Eubacterium
      limosum (E. limosum), which is a commensal microorganism that is promoted by GBF 
      administration. The metabolites of E. limosum included butyrate, which can
      accelerate intestinal epithelial growth and inhibit IL-6 production. This new
      probiotic approach may be useful as an adjunctive IBD treatment in the future.
      Although these strategies hold great promise and appear to be useful in some
      settings, more experimental and clinical studies are needed to firmly establish
      their relevance.

TI  - Green fluorescent protein for detection of the probiotic microorganism
      Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 (EcN) in vivo.
PG  - 389-98
AB  - Probiotic microorganisms are defined as viable nutritional agents conferring
      benefit to the health of the human host. Especially, Escherichia coli strain
      Nissle 1917 (EcN) was shown to be equally effective as mesalazine in the
      maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis (UC). Presumably, the therapeutic 
      effect of EcN is linked to the presence of the strain in the region of interest; 
      however, it remains difficult to follow the orally administered strain on its
      passage through the complex microbial environment of the intestine in vivo,
      inhabited dominantly by various E. coli strains, using traditional culturing
      methods. In this study we transformed EcN and a wild-type E. coli from a
      laboratory rat (EcR) with a plasmid carrying a gfp gene (pUC-gfp) to obtain EcN- 
      and EcR-GFP to allow in vivo detection without alteration of strain-specific
      characteristics. Analysis of different strain-specific characteristics included
      the measurement of stimulation of IL-8 secretion and adhesion in vitro using the 
      epithelial cell line HT-29. The kinetics of intestinal distribution in mice and
      colonization properties in rats following oral administration was studied in
      vivo. Detectability of the strain in histologic specimens was analysed using
      fluorescence microscopy and immunohistochemistry. The identity of fluorescent E. 
      coli strains isolated from stool samples, Peyer's patches (PP) and mesenteric
      lymph nodes (MLN) was determined by REP-PCR. We were able to demonstrate that EcN
      and EcN-GFP do not differ in stimulation of IL-8 secretion or adhesion to HT-29
      cells. In vivo, EcN-GFP colonies were readily detectable by fluorescence
      microscopy in luminal samples and also by immunohistochemistry in histological
      sections allowing analysis of the kinetics of the intestinal passage following
      oral administration. Translocation of fluorescent and non-fluorescent bacteria
      into PP and MLN was noted at 6 h post oral administration. EcN-GFP was detectable
      initially for 14 days in faecal samples of rats, while EcR-GFP was detectable
      throughout the whole experiment (45 days). Challenge with ampicillin at day 45
      demonstrated continuing presence of EcN-GFP in small numbers by reappearing
      fluorescent colonies. The plasmid was not stable in vivo since non-fluorescent
      EcN colonies were detected also in faecal samples by REP-PCR. In summary,
      transformation of EcN to obtain EcN-GFP in our study had no detectable influence 
      on the probiotic microorganism regarding adhesion on and induction of IL-8
      secretion of HT-29 cells and allows the detection in mixed microbial environments
      in vivo but the stability of EcN-GFP in vivo is limited.

TI  - Intestinal immunity of Escherichia coli NISSLE 1917: a safe carrier for
      therapeutic molecules.
PG  - 373-84
AB  - The development of novel approaches that allow accurate targeting of therapeutics
      to the intestinal mucosa is a major task in the research on intestinal
      inflammation. For the first time, a live genetically modified bacterial strain
      has been approved by Dutch authorities as a therapeutic agent for experimental
      therapy of intestinal bowel disease (IBD) in humans. Genetically modified
      probiotics can very well be used as carriers for localized antigen delivery into 
      the intestine. Therapeutic safety, however, of such a carrier organism, is
      crucial, especially when a specific probiotic strain has to be used under
      diseased conditions. In this study, we tested the potential of Escherichia coli
      NISSLE 1917 to serve as a safe carrier for targeted delivery of recombinant
      proteins to the intestinal mucosa. In a well-defined and very sensitive
      immunological system, we demonstrate that intestinal recombinant E. coli NISSLE
      1917 has no effect on migration, clonal expansion and activation status of
      specific CD4+ T cells, neither in healthy mice nor in animals with acute colitis.
      Furthermore, recombinant E. coli NISSLE 1917 has no effect on the induction or
      breakdown of peripheral T-cell tolerance in an autoimmune environment. The
      excellent colonization properties of E. coli NISSLE 1917 render this strain an
      ideal candidate as carrier organism for gut-focused in situ synthesis of
      therapeutic molecules.

TI  - Probiotic therapy of intestinal inflammation and infections.
PG  - 44-50
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The author presents evidence published during the past year
      regarding treatment of clinical and experimental intestinal inflammation and
      infections by probiotic agents. RECENT FINDINGS: Normal commensal bacteria are
      implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic, immune-mediated intestinal
      inflammation, particularly Crohn disease and pouchitis, whereas viral, bacterial,
      fungal, and protozoan infections are increasingly important with widespread use
      of immunosuppressive agents and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Combinations of
      Lactobacilli, Bifidobacteria, and Streptococcus salivarius prevent relapse of
      recurrent pouchitis and perhaps decrease the initial onset of pouch inflammation,
      whereas Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 maintains remission in ulcerative colitis.
      Several agents offer promise as primary therapy of ulcerative colitis. Use of
      probiotics in Crohn disease remains unsubstantiated. Animal models demonstrate
      marked differences in responses among various probiotic bacterial species and
      that nonviable organisms can have therapeutic efficacy. Probiotics have multiple 
      mechanisms of action, including prevention of pathogenic bacterial growth,
      binding to or penetration of pathogens to mucosal surfaces, stimulation of
      mucosal barrier function, or altering immunoregulation (decreasing
      proinflammatory and promoting protective molecules). Although multiple probiotic 
      species block epithelial adhesion and invasion by microbial pathogens in vitro,
      their proven utility in clinical infections is limited to accelerating recovery
      from acute infectious diarrhea and preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea.
      SUMMARY: Probiotics offer promise for physiologic, nontoxic treatment of
      pouchitis, ulcerative colitis, and acute infectious diarrhea, but larger,
      controlled clinical studies must be performed to clarify optimal agents; doses;
      combinations of various probiotics, prebiotics, and antibiotics; and therapeutic 
      conditions.

      inflammatory response of IBD. At the moment it is assumed that all components are
      necessary to have the typical manifestations of IBD but, in reality, it is
      unclear to what extent each factor contributes to the disease process, and
      whether some are more important than others. In addition, some factors are not
      practical targets; for example, environmental factors are poorly defined, too
      numerous, and require changes that cannot be implemented by the physician or the 
      patient alone. The same is true for genetic factors that are still not amenable
      to therapeutic manipulations for technical and ethical reasons. This leaves
      microbial and immune factors as the two categories that can be selected for
      therapeutic intervention and where all current treatments are focused. The
      commensal gut flora can be qualitatively or quantitatively modified with
      antibiotics, probiotics, or diet, and a better characterization of enteric
      bacteria strains should help greatly in developing more effective therapies. Most
      current drugs are focused on inhibiting pro-inflammatory molecules produced by
      immune cells, including biological agents that block specific cytokines such as
      tumor necrosis factor-alpha. It is anticipated that combination therapies
      targeting multiple pathogenic components will prove more effective than those
      blocking single components of IBD pathogenesis.

TI  - Synbiotic therapy (Bifidobacterium longum/Synergy 1) initiates resolution of
      inflammation in patients with active ulcerative colitis: a randomised controlled 
      pilot trial.
PG  - 242-9
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an acute and chronic inflammatory
      disease of the large bowel with unknown aetiology. The immune response against
      normal commensal microorganisms is believed to drive inflammatory processes
      associated with UC. Therefore, modulation of bacterial communities on the gut
      mucosa, through the use of probiotics and prebiotics, may be used to modify the
      disease state. METHODS: A synbiotic was developed for use in UC patients
      combining a probiotic, Bifidobacterium longum, isolated from healthy rectal
      epithelium, and a prebiotic (Synergy 1), a preferential inulin-oligofructose
      growth substrate for the probiotic strain. Treatment was employed in a double
      blinded randomised controlled trial using 18 patients with active UC for a period
      of one month. Clinical status was scored and rectal biopsies were collected
      before and after treatment, and transcription levels of epithelium related immune
      markers were measured. RESULTS: Sigmoidoscopy scores (scale 0-6) were reduced in 
      the test group (start 4.5 (1.4), end 3.1 (2.5)) compared with placebo (start 2.6 
      (2.1), end 3.2 (2.2)) (p=0.06). mRNA levels for human beta defensins 2, 3, and 4,
      which are strongly upregulated in active UC, were significantly reduced in the
      test group after treatment (p=0.016, 0.038, and 0.008, respectively). Tumour
      necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 1alpha, which are inflammatory cytokines
      that drive inflammation and induce defensin expression, were also significantly
      reduced after treatment (p=0.018 and 0.023, respectively). Biopsies in the test
      group had reduced inflammation and regeneration of epithelial tissue.
      CONCLUSIONS: Short term synbiotic treatment of active UC resulted in improvement 
      of the full clinical appearance of chronic inflammation in patients receiving
      this therapy.
