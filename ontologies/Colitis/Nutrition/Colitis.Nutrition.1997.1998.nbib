TI  - Dietary carbohydrates and the colonic microflora.
PG  - 409-14
AB  - The world of the colonic microflora has lain dormant in recent years, but is
      coming alive now with the advent of new chemical and molecular technologies for
      identifying bacteria, and the emergence of the concepts of biofilms, pro- and
      prebiotics. That bacteria play an essential role in barrier resistance to
      infection, ulcerative colitis and colorectal cancer is slowly becoming clear. New
      potential therapeutic avenues using bacteria should soon start to open up.
      Scientifically we lack an understanding of the mechanisms at work.

PG  - 1056-60
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the influence of inflammatory bowel disease on pregnancy 
      and fetal outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and fifty pregnancies in 72 
      women (28 with ulcerative colitis and 44 with Crohn's disease) were compared with
      those of 150 control subjects. RESULTS: Among 150 pregnancies, 108 (group I)
      began before and 42 (group II) at the same time or after the diagnosis of
      inflammatory bowel disease. In ulcerative colitis patients, age at first
      pregnancy, mean birth weight and preterm birth rates were not different between
      groups I and II; rate of underweight offsprings was significantly higher (P <
      0.05) in group II than in group I and controls. In Crohn's disease, compared to
      group I, mean age of first pregnancy was higher (P < 0.0001), mean birth weight
      was lower (P < 0.005) and preterm birth rate was higher (P = 0.001) than in group
      II. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
      disease induce deleterious effects on pregnancy and fetal outcome.

PG  - 229-35
AB  - The presence of virulence genes, encoding enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli
      (EHEC)-hemolysin (EHEC-hlyA), intimin (eae), and Shiga toxins 1 (stx1) and 2
      (stx2), in 178 isolates of pathogenic E. coli, was determined using the
      polymerase chain reaction with primers specific for each virulence gene. The
      tested organisms were 120 isolates of E. coli O157:H7 from human patients,
      cattle, sheep and foods, 16 non-O157:H7 EHEC isolates from patients suffering
      from hemorrhagic colitis or hemolytic uremic syndrome, 15 non-O157:H7 Shiga
      toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) isolates from cattle and foods, 26 isolates of
      enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) and
      enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), and an E. coli K12 strain. Results revealed that 
      all isolates of O157:H7 carried EHEC-hlyA, eae, and one or both stx genes; 15 of 
      the 16 non-O157:H7 EHEC isolates had EHEC-hlyA, but all possessed eae and one or 
      both stx genes; only seven of the 15 non-O157 STEC isolated from cattle and foods
      contained both EHEC-hlyA and eae genes. The EPEC, EIEC, ETEC, and the E. coli K12
      strain did not carry these virulence genes, except eight EPEC isolates were
      positive for eae. Results suggest that a combination of EHEC-hlyA and eae genes
      could serve as markers to differentiate EHEC from less pathogenic STEC, and other
      pathogenic or non-pathogenic E. coli.

TI  - Patients' diets and preferences in a pediatric population with inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 544-9
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the dietary practices of the pediatric inflammatory bowel
      disease population at the Children's Hospital of the Hamilton Health Sciences
      Corporation and the reported effectiveness of those diets. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      A questionnaire mailed to 153 pediatric patients was returned by 125 patients (76
      Crohn's disease [CD] and 49 ulcerative colitis [UC] patients)--an 82% response
      rate. RESULTS: The median age of respondents was 13 years, and 62% were male.
      Ninety per cent and 71% of CD and UC patients, respectively, had changed their
      diets since diagnosis. Caloric supplements (eg, BOOST [Mead Johnson
      Nutritionals]), sole source nutrition, low fibre and lactose-free diets were used
      by more than 15% of CD patients, whereas lactose-free, nonspicy, low acid,
      additive-free, caloric supplement and low fibre diets were used by more than 15% 
      of UC patients. A diet supplement was more commonly used in CD patients (P <
      0.05) and an additive-free diet in UC patients. Corn and corn products, nuts,
      milk and bran were avoided by more than 20% of CD and UC patients; however, more 
      CD than UC patients avoided corn and corn products. In addition, UC patients
      (more than 20%) also avoided tomato, other dairy (nonfluid milk-based products
      and foods containing milk products), chocolate, cheese, wheat, tomato sauces and 
      fruit juice. A benefit was reported for 103 of 141 reported diets, with the most 
      commonly alleviated symptoms being abdominal pain, diarrhea and flatulence.
      CONCLUSION: Many children with inflammatory bowel disease have altered their
      diets to manage their disease and have attributed symptomatic relief to these
      diets.

TI  - [Effect of smoking on the long-term course of ulcerative colitis].
PG  - 858-62
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of smoking on the long term clinical course in
      patients with ulcerative colitis. METHODS: The medical charts of 556 patients
      with ulcerative colitis were reviewed retrospectively. Patients were classified
      as smokers (n = 85) or nonsmokers (n = 471) according to their smoking status
      during the course of the disease. Extent of colonic lesions, complications,
      medical requirements, and actuarial rate of colectomy were compared in smokers
      and nonsmokers. RESULTS: Mean follow-up (+/- SD) was longer in smokers than in
      nonsmokers (116 +/- 107 mo, vs 87 +/- 94 mo.). Less smokers than nonsmokers
      required oral steroids (52 vs 63%, P = 0.05). No difference between the groups
      was observed regarding the use of salicylates, the need for intravenous steroids,
      for immunosuppressive drugs, for colectomy, and the occurrence of complications. 
      The actuarial rate of colectomy was less in smokers than in nonsmokers (32 +/-
      12% and 42 +/- 6% at 10 years respectively. P = 0.04). Initial and cumulative
      extent of the disease process did not differ between the groups. However, in the 
      subgroup of patients with limited disease at onset, development of pancolitis was
      less frequent in smokers than in nonsmokers (14 and 26%, respectively, P = 0.04).
      CONCLUSION: The lesser need for oral steroids and the lower actuarial rate of
      colectomy in smokers suggest that ulcerative colitis in smokers is characterized 
      by a less severe clinical presentation and a better long term prognosis than in
      nonsmokers.

TI  - Efficacy and efficiency of oral microemulsion cyclosporin versus intravenous and 
      soft gelatin capsule cyclosporin in the treatment of severe steroid-refractory
      ulcerative colitis: an open-label retrospective trial.
PG  - 276-9
AB  - We have used cyclosporin to treat patients with acute steroid-resistant
      ulcerative colitis since the beginning of 1991. Of the 55 patients so far elected
      for treatment, 40 received the drug intravenously at 2 mg/kg/day for 14 days,
      with the responders being maintained on traditional soft-gelatin-capsule
      cyclosporin at a dose of 6-8 mg/kg/day for 6 months; the remaining 15 received
      oral microemulsion cyclosporin, 5 mg/kg/day, for 3 months. The doses were
      titrated to ensure whole-blood drug concentrations of 60-240 ng/ml, with levels
      of approximately 200 ng/ml being attained by both regimens. One-hundred percent
      of the patients receiving oral microemulsion cyclosporin and 65% of those
      receiving the intravenous regimen achieved a short-term response (p = 0.011).
      Both the responder subsets received additional azathioprine and relapsed on
      treatment with the same frequency of 40%. However, 17% of the patients who
      received intravenous cyclosporin developed major toxicity (including one
      fatality), whereas no major toxicity was observed in the oral microemulsion
      cyclosporin group. The microemulsion formulation was therefore more effective
      than intravenous cyclosporin in achieving the short-term remission of
      steroid-unresponsive ulcerative colitis. As the maintenance drug, it led to the
      same frequency of disease relapse as traditional oral cyclosporin. However,
      because it did not involve invasive in-hospital procedures or cause major
      toxicity, it was more efficient than the combination of the intravenous and
      traditional oral drug.

TI  - [Enteral nutrition in severe ulcerative colitis. Digestive tolerance and
      nutritional efficiency].
PG  - 899-904
AB  - BACKGROUNDS AND AIMS: Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) has been traditionally
      used as an adjunctive therapy in severe ulcerative colitis patients. We performed
      a prospective study to ascertain the safety, nutritional efficiency, tolerance
      and costs of total enteral nutrition in this situation. METHODS: After 48 hours
      of intensive medical treatment, severe ulcerative colitis patients initiated
      enteral feeding with a polymeric formula. The formula concentration and volume
      were increased daily. RESULTS: 17 patients (7 women, 10 men; age 36.8 +/- 12.8
      years) with a mean clinical activity score of 15.6 +/- 1.5 were included. In 14
      patients (82.4%) enteral nutrition was well tolerated, attaining in 11 of them
      more than 80% of the caloric requirements by day 4. In 3 cases we observed
      vomiting and bloating. Prealbumin levels improved significantly from 11.1 +/- 3.4
      mg/dl to 22.7 +/- 6.8 mg/dl (p = 0.002) at the end of enteral nutrition (11.8 +/-
      4.7 days). Albumin and other nutritional parameters did not change. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Total enteral nutrition could be considered a safe and well tolerated nutritional
      support in these patients. Although albumin and other nutritional parameters did 
      not change during the study period, the increase in prealbumin levels suggests a 
      favourable anabolic effect of total enteral nutrition.

      depletion in patients with gastrointestinal disease. METHODS: The concentration
      of selenium and the activity of glutathione peroxidase in plasma and erythrocytes
      were measured by fluorometry and by spectrophotometry. Eighty-six patients with
      Crohn's disease, 40 patients with ulcerative colitis, and 39 patients with
      various other gastrointestinal diseases were studied. Twenty-seven patients (16%)
      received home parenteral nutrition. Stool mass, faecal fat, and vitamin B12
      absorption were analysed in 100 patients. RESULTS: The plasma selenium
      concentration was decreased in 85% of the patients receiving supplementary
      parenteral nutrition and in 20% of the patients receiving oral nutrition, among
      them in 26% of the patients with Crohn's disease. Almost all patients with
      ulcerative colitis had normal selenium levels. A statistically significant
      correlation was found between plasma selenium and vitamin B12 absorption, stool
      mass, faecal fat excretion, body mass index, P-albumin, P-zinc, and the length of
      the remaining small bowel. Stepwise regression analyses showed that the strongest
      predictors of selenium deficiency were stool mass, vitamin B12 absorption, and
      the length of the small-bowel resection. CONCLUSION: Selenium deficiency is
      common in patients with severe gastrointestinal disorders. The deficiency is
      mainly related to malabsorption, and a low selenium level was almost invariably
      present in patients who needed parenteral supplementation due to gut failure.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To cells play a crucial role in many chronic inflammatory diseases.
      Mucosal T cells are particularly important in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease
      (CD). We investigated the response of T cells in CD and other intestinal
      inflammatory conditions to interleukin-2 (IL-2), a cytokine essential for T-cell 
      activation, growth, and function. STUDY DESIGN: T-cell reactivity was assessed by
      measuring growth induced by IL-2 in mucosal endoscopic biopsy specimens obtained 
      from children with CD, ulcerative colitis, indeterminate colitis, and chronic
      nonspecific colitis and from children without gastrointestinal inflammation.
      RESULTS: CD mucosal T cells grew remarkably and significantly more than T cells
      from normal, ulcerative colitis, and chronic nonspecific colitis mucosa. T cells 
      from indeterminate colitis mucosa grew similarly to those of CD mucosa. The
      enhanced growth response in CD was independent of disease location, presence or
      absence of intestinal inflammation, treatment, disease duration, or clinical
      activity. CONCLUSION: Mucosal T cells from children with CD exhibit an intrinsic 
      hyperreactivity to IL-2. This may represent a primary pathogenic abnormality in
      this condition.

PG  - 499-506
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases remain a significant chronic disease affecting
      children and adolescents. Although corticosteroids remain the standard form of
      therapy for many patients, an era of biological agents for therapy in
      inflammatory bowel diseases is upcoming with human trials using these agents now 
      forthcoming. In addition, studies on maintenance of remission are beginning to
      address the selection of those patients most likely to benefit from
      aminosalicylate therapies, the risks of relapse from using cyclooxygenase
      inhibitors, the lack of benefit from lipoxygenase inhibitors, and possible future
      methodologies to examine the effectiveness of the immuno-suppressive agent
      6-mercaptopurine. Further development of the hypothesis that new-onset disease
      may be different than longstanding disease can be appreciated with reports of
      cytokine analysis in new-onset inflammation and the high risk of progression of
      disease in new-onset ulcerative proctitis in children. With more reports on the
      role of intestinal epithelial cells in intestinal diseases, it is now clear that 
      this cell layer is not a passive bystander with regard to the interactions
      between the luminal contents and immune system components found within the lamina
      propria; new studies suggest that novel therapeutic strategies may be possible.
      This review summarizes recently reported aspects of Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis, with an emphasis on issues-pertinent for younger patients.

TI  - [Toxic megacolon as a complication of Campylobacter jejuni enterocolitis].
PG  - 1553-8
AB  - We report the case of a previously healthy 53-year-old white male who developed
      an extraordinary complication of acute Campylobacter jejuni colitis. Toxic
      megacolon occurred while the patient was treated with a fluoroquinolone
      antibiotic and glucocorticoids, which were given for endoscopically suspected
      Crohn's colitis. During the course of the disease no cause of colitis was found
      other than C. jejuni. Despite the extreme dilatation, the patient was treated
      conservatively with parenteral nutrition and repeated decompression colonoscopies
      and made a full, though slow, and uneventful recovery. Follow-up colonoscopies
      for up to 4 years showed persistent scarring of the transverse colon, probably
      due to the extreme dilatation, and mild unspecific inflammation of the terminal
      ileum without histological evidence of inflammatory bowel disease. A comparison
      with the 6 previously published cases leads to the following conclusions: in most
      cases the transverse colon is most severely affected. Treatment with either
      antimotility agents or systemic glucocorticoids does not seem to promote colonic 
      dilatation. The complication has affected patients of both sexes (4 women, 3
      men), in the age range of 21 to 83 years, most of them without an underlying
      disease. The interval between the start of diarrhea and development of the
      megacolon ranged widely from 3 to 33 days, as did recovery time (2 days to
      several months). Three of the 7 patients underwent colectomy for imminent or
      actual colonic perforation. The delayed recovery of our patient was partly
      attributed to colonic damage caused by extreme dilatation, leading to ischaemia
      and subsequent scarring of the mucosa, which persisted. Histologically no Crohn's
      disease or ulcerative colitis could be found at any stage. A rapid increase in
      resistance of C. species against fluoroquinolone antibodies has been observed in 
      recent years, due to use of the antibiotics in farming. Our patient's severe
      illness may partly have resulted from delayed effective antibiotic treatment due 
      to resistance. Antibiotic resistance to common enteropathogens should be
      considered in the case of unusually prolonged or severe enterocolitis. The level 
      of suspicion for either infection or inflammatory bowel disease should remain
      high as it may be impossible to distinguish between them on the basis of clinical
      or endoscopic criteria alone.

AB  - Many nutritional issues are important in the care of children and adolescents
      with inflammatory bowel disease. No specific dietary toxin or antigen has been
      identified to have an etiologic role in either ulcerative colitis or Crohn's
      disease. A possible modulating effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on
      intestinal inflammation is being investigated. Most prevalent among the
      nutritional consequences of inflammatory bowel disease is weight loss, for which 
      inadequate caloric intake is primarily responsible. Impairment of linear growth
      and associated delay in pubertal development commonly complicate childhood
      Crohn's disease. The two major etiologic factors are chronic undernutrition and
      direct effects of inflammatory mediators secreted from the inflamed gut. Recent
      studies have incriminated interleukin-6. Treatment of intestinal inflammation and
      provision of adequate nutrition are of paramount importance in preventing or
      remedying growth impairment. Exclusive enteral nutrition using formulated food is
      efficacious primary therapy of active Crohn's disease, although the mode of
      action is poorly understood.

TI  - Local and systemic effects of macrophage cytokines in intestinal inflammation.
PG  - 780-3
AB  - The activation of macrophages and newly recruited monocytes appears to be common 
      to both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, despite different inductive
      stimuli. Similar activation occurs acutely during the course of invasive
      intestinal infections such as shigellosis, but is then usually downregulated. The
      macrophage cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 (IL-1) are
      centrally involved in the local inflammatory response, and blockade of either
      cytokine greatly attenuates the inflammatory lesion. Induction of focal vascular 
      thrombosis and matrix degradation are thought to be an important component of
      this focal damage. Both cytokines and IL-6 are now recognized to contribute to
      the systemic effects of intestinal disease, including growth suppression,
      anorexia, and chronic anemia. Disturbance of sleep patterns, mood, and affect may
      also occur, and recent evidence points towards bidirectional interplay between
      macrophage cytokines and central nervous system function.

AB  - Pediatric Crohn's disease is a severe disease with digestive and extra-digestive 
      manifestations. Growth retardation is a common feature. Diagnosis is based on
      endoscopy and histology with evidence of granulomas. Remission can be achieved by
      using anti-inflammatory treatment or continuous enteral feeding. Course of the
      disease is marked by relapse with extension. Surgery is limited in children.
      Ulcerative colitis is limited on rectum and colon and includes also
      extra-digestive manifestations. Bloody diarrhoea with abdominal pain is
      characteristic. Diagnosis is based on endoscopy and histology. Treatment depends 
      on the severity of the disease but can include rapidly colectomy for persistent
      severe bloody diarrhoea.

TI  - Diagnostic accuracy of serological assays in pediatric inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 822-9
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Accurate serological assays are desirable for the diagnosis of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) types in the pediatric age group. The aim of
      this study was to test the diagnostic accuracy of modified assays for perinuclear
      (p) antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) and anti-Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae antibodies (ASCAs) in patients with pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC) 
      and Crohn's disease (CD) and in those without IBD. METHODS: With observers
      blinded to patients' diagnoses, serum specimens were analyzed for immunoglobulin 
      (Ig) A and IgG ASCAs and ANCAs by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The
      perinuclear location of ANCAs visualized by indirect immunofluorescence was
      confirmed by its disappearance after administration of deoxyribonuclease.
      RESULTS: IgA and IgG ASCA titers were significantly greater and highly specific
      for CD (95% for either, 100% if both positive). pANCA was 92% specific for UC and
      absent in all non-IBD controls. The majority of patients with CD positive for
      pANCA had a UC-like presentation. Disease location, duration, activity,
      complications, and treatment with immunosuppressive drugs did not have an impact 
      on the ASCA or pANCA assay results. After resection, UC patients remained pANCA
      positive, in contrast to patients with CD, in whom ASCA titers decreased toward
      normal values postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: ASCA and pANCA assays are highly
      disease specific for CD and UC, respectively. These serological tests can assist 
      clinicians in diagnosing and categorizing patients with IBD and may be useful in 
      making therapeutic decisions.

TI  - Safety of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine in pediatric patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 813-21
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Azathioprine (AZA) and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) are used in
      pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease to reduce disease 
      activity, maintain remission, prevent relapse, and lower corticosteroid dosage,
      but their long-term side effects remain to be studied. The aim of this study was 
      to analyze the safety of AZA and 6-MP and steroid reduction in this age group.
      METHODS: The investigators' database identified 118 patients who received either 
      drug; 23 were excluded (single visit, noncompliance, or therapy < 1 week),
      leaving 95 patients, with a mean (+/-SD) age of 14.2 +/- 4.4 years. Medical files
      were reviewed for adverse side effects: fever, pancreatitis, infections,
      gastrointestinal intolerance, aminotransferase level increase, leukopenia, and
      thrombocytopenia. Prednisone doses before and after immunomodulatory therapy were
      compared. RESULTS: AZA or 6-MP was tolerated in 51 of 95 patients (54%) without
      adverse reaction; 27 of 95 (28%) experienced side effects that responded to dose 
      reduction (23 patients) or spontaneously (4 patients), most commonly increased
      aminotransferase level (13.7%). Cessation of therapy was needed in 17 of 95
      patients (18%), including recurrent fever (4), pancreatitis (4), gastrointestinal
      intolerance (4), and recurrent infections (3). Mean prednisone dose decreased
      from 24.3 to 8.6 mg/day. CONCLUSIONS: AZA and 6-MP were well tolerated in 82% of 
      patients; of these, prednisone reduction occurred in 87%. However, 18% required
      discontinuation because of hypersensitivity or infectious side effects.

TI  - Sulfur metabolism in ulcerative colitis: investigation of detoxification enzymes 
      in peripheral blood.
PG  - 2080-5
AB  - Two enzymes of detoxification were studied in blood samples from 27 patients with
      ulcerative colitis (UC) and 18 controls to determine whether there is an
      abnormality in sulfur metabolism in UC. Thiol methyltransferase (TMT) activity
      was measured in erythrocyte membranes as the extent of conversion of
      2-mercaptoethanol to S-methyl-2-mercaptoethanol with [3H]methyl-S-adenosyl
      methionine as methyl donor. Phenol sulfotransferase (PST) activity was measured
      in platelet homogenates as the extent of sulfation of p-nitrophenol with
      3-phosphoadenosine 5-phospho[35S]sulfate (PAPS) as sulfate donor. TMT activity
      was significantly higher in UC patients (27.0 vs 17.1 nmol/mg protein/hr; P <
      0.005). No difference in PST activity was found. We conclude that TMT may be
      up-regulated in UC to detoxify excess hydrogen sulfide exposed to the peripheral 
      blood compartment. This may arise from either increased luminal sulfide
      production or reduced colonic detoxification.

TI  - Selective omission of loop ileostomy in restorative proctocolectomy.
PG  - 119-23
AB  - Omission of a temporary ileostomy in patients undergoing restorative
      proctocolectomy is controversial. Although fewer operations may be required and
      some complications avoided, the risks of anastomotic dehiscence and pelvic sepsis
      may be greater. Patients undergoing restorative proctocolectomy with no ileostomy
      (Group NI, n = 72) were compared retrospectively with patients given a
      conventional loop ileostomy (Group I, n = 30). Criteria for avoiding faecal
      diversion included: absence of severe acute colitis, good nutritional status and 
      favourable surgery with creation of a sound, tension-free anastomosis. Steroid
      intake was not a contraindication to single-stage surgery. Delayed stomas were
      necessary in 8% of Group NI. For Groups NI and I, the rates of anastomotic leak
      (3% vs 3%), pelvic sepsis without demonstrable leak (3% vs 0%), pouch fistula (3%
      vs 10%) and intestinal obstruction (8% vs 3%) were similar. Closure of the
      temporary ileostomy in Group I was associated with a 10% complication rate.
      Cumulative post-operative hospital stay was significantly less in Group NI
      (median 11 vs 16 days). Functional results at 1 year were similar. A temporary
      loop ileostomy can be safely avoided in carefully selected patients undergoing
      restorative proctocolectomy.

TI  - Cutaneous advancement flap closure: alternative method for treatment of
      complicated anal fistulas.
PG  - 884-6; discussion 886-7
AB  - PURPOSE: A retrospective chart review of 20 consecutive patients with 23 anal
      fistulas treated with cutaneous advancement flap closure was undertaken to
      ascertain the efficacy of this previously unreported technique. METHODS: The
      so-called "diamond" and "house" flaps are commonly used to treat anal stenosis,
      and mucosal advancement flaps are successfully used to close fistulas. The
      authors began, in 1994, to close selected fistulas with skin advancement flaps
      after suture closure of the internal opening and adequate drainage of the
      external opening. Fourteen patients (4 females; average age, 42 years; a total of
      14 fistulas) without inflammatory bowel disease and 6 patients (3 females;
      average age, 35 years) with inflammatory bowel disease (5 with Crohn's disease; 1
      with chronic ulcerative colitis; a total of 8 fistulas) were treated. Indications
      were low internal opening with transsphincteric fistula in both groups. Mucosal
      advancement was relatively contraindicated, either because of fear of ectropion
      or, in the inflammatory bowel disease patients, diseased mucosa. No one in the
      noninflammatory bowel disease group was diverted or kept without anything by
      mouth, and all were treated as outpatients or with overnight observation. The
      inflammatory bowel disease group was either diverted (1 patient) or kept on home 
      total parenteral nutrition (5 patients) for three to six weeks. Cyclosporine,
      antibiotics, 5-acetylsalicylic acid, and other medications were used judiciously 
      in the inflammatory bowel disease group. RESULTS: In the noninflammatory bowel
      disease group, complete healing of all wounds occurred in 11 patients in an
      average of 6.5 weeks (average follow-up, 18 months). Complications included donor
      site separation in two patients and minor incontinence of flatus in one patient. 
      In the inflammatory bowel disease group, five fistulas healed, two failed, and
      one patient developed a new fistula during an average follow-up of 16 months.
      Deep venous thrombosis and catheter sepsis occurred in one patient in this group.
      There were no fatalities in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Although the numbers,
      especially in the inflammatory bowel disease group, are very small, the results
      are encouraging. This technique appears to have a place in the armamentarium of
      the surgeon repairing anal fistulas.

TI  - Taurolidine 2% as an antimicrobial lock solution for prevention of recurrent
      catheter-related bloodstream infections.
PG  - 242-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: This case report describes our preliminary data on the use of
      taurolidine as a lock technique. Taurolidine is a novel antimicrobial agent that 
      has found a niche in Europe for prevention of bacteremia in home parenteral
      nutrition (HPN) patients who have multiple catheter-related blood-stream
      infections. METHODS: A 29-year-old male with short bowel syndrome was admitted 18
      times in 9 years for treatment of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and
      yeast-associated catheter-related bloodstream infections. Management consisted of
      conventional antibiotic treatment in accordance with blood culture and
      sensitivity results as well as catheter removal in 10 cases. Ten months before
      the last infection, the patient was instructed to instil 1.5 mL taurolidine 2%
      daily into his central line after finishing his HPN infusion and has continued to
      do so 2 years to date. RESULTS: The incidence of catheter-related bloodstream
      infections decreased from 8.5 to 1.5 infections per 1000 catheter days.
      CONCLUSIONS: These data support previous observations made outside North America 
      and suggest that taurolidine may prove to be an effective and safe antimicrobial 
      agent for the prevention of recurrent catheter-related bloodstream infections.

TI  - Metabolic features of inflammatory bowel disease in a remission phase of the
      disease activity.
PG  - 339-47
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the anthropometric and metabolic characteristics of
      patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), comparing both
      groups with healthy volunteers. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SETTING: The
      Department of Internal Medicine, Catholic University Hospital, Rome, Italy.
      SUBJECTS: Thirty-four patients with biopsy-proven inflammatory bowel disease (18 
      CD; 16 UC) in clinical remission (SCDAI < 3 and Powell-Tuck index < 4) not
      receiving steroid therapy. INTERVENTIONS: All patients had a clinical
      examination. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Blood indicators of inflammation and
      nutritional status. Body composition was assessed by both anthropometry and
      bioimpedance and metabolic variables were measured by indirect calorimetry over a
      60-90 min period. RESULTS: CD had a lower body weight than both controls (58.1
      kg, range 41.5-71.0 vs. 66.4 kg, range 57.0-76.0; P < 0.001) and UC) 58.1 kg,
      range 41.5-71.0 vs. 69.6 kg, range 50.5-94.0; (P < 0.001). Fat-free mass (FFM)
      did not differ between the groups, whilst fat mass was significantly lower in CD 
      than in UC (P < 0.05) and controls (P < 0.001). Normalizing the basal metabolic
      rate by FFM, a higher value was found in CD compared with UC (143 kJ kg-1)
      d-(-1), range 97.5-179 vs. 133 kJ kg-1 d-1, range 123-148; P < 0.05) and control 
      subject 143 kj kg-1 d-1, range 97.5-179 vs. 134 kj kg-1 d-1, range 122-162; P <
      0.05). The nonprotein respiratory quotient was significantly lower in CD compared
      to UC 0.80, range 0.73-0.84 vs. 0.84, range 0.79-0.91; P < 0.01) and controls
      (0.80, range 0.73-0.84 vs. 0.83, range 0.81-0.87; P < 0.001), with a consequently
      higher lipid oxidation rate in CD. CONCLUSIONS: CD subjects showed a decreased
      fat mass and enhanced utilization of lipids compared with UC and controls. These 
      data could be explained by the larger intestinal involvement and considered as a 
      contribution to lipid tissue wasting in CD.

TI  - [Surgical concepts in Crohn disease of the terminal ileum and colon].
PG  - 331-7
AB  - Most patients with Crohn's disease have to be operated on. Necessity to loose
      some amount of the intestine and time-point of the surgical intervention may be
      derived from the irreversible cascade of the inflammatory process and the
      limitations of the conservative treatment. In ileocecal disease indications for
      surgery are represented by stenotic and/or penetrating complications of the
      inflamed bowel, whereas in Crohn's colitis acute or terminal medical refractority
      is predominating. Standard-procedures result from constantly definable patterns
      of the disease manifestation: ileocecal resection and colectomy/-proctocolectomy.
      In segmental colitis sometimes "resections within Crohn's" may be adequate in a
      first attempt to avoid anticipating the natural course by surgical means. In
      these cases the further prognosis depends on the treatment possibilities of the
      remaining colon. In contrast, true recurrence is a new inflammation of the
      neoterminal ileum and may indicate repeated resections. The frequence decreases
      with the number of resections. Nevertheless nutritional status is restored even
      by multiple resections, whereas specific functional sequelae of the
      resection--distal resection- and dehydration syndromes--are well treatable
      mostly. In the case of appropriate timing of the operation and the reoperation
      operative morbidity and mortality are remarkable low today resulting in an almost
      normal life expectancy. Most important as negative prognostic factor remains
      sepsis resulting from pre-existing or postoperative infectious complications.
      Keeping this in mind experimental pharmaco-therapy to delay the operation and not
      profoundly substantiated tendencies to minimize surgery are to be considered only
      with critical scepticism. At the moment, future research is thought to be more
      successful in focussing prophylaxis of ileal recurrence than avoiding surgery.

TI  - Bone mineral density assessment in children with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 902-11
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at risk for
      osteoporosis because of undernutrition, delayed puberty, and prolonged
      corticosteroid use. The aim of this study was to compare bone mineral density
      (BMD) in children with IBD with that in normal children and to assess the effects
      of nutritional and hormonal factors and corticosteroid dosages on BMD. METHODS:
      One hundred sixty-two subjects (99 with IBD and 63 healthy sibling controls) were
      enrolled. Patients underwent anthropometric assessment, pubertal staging, bone
      age radiography, and BMD assessment by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry of the
      lumbar spine, femoral neck, and radius. Laboratory evaluations included serum
      calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, 25-hydroxyvitamin D,
      1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone, osteocalcin, urinary
      N-telopeptides, albumin, insulin-like growth factor I, and testosterone or
      estradiol. Cumulative corticosteroid doses were calculated. RESULTS: BMD Z scores
      at the lumbar spine and femoral neck were lower in patients with IBD, and lower
      in those with Crohn's disease compared with those with ulcerative colitis. Low
      BMD persisted after correction for bone age in girls with Crohn's disease (lumbar
      spine, P = 0.004; femoral neck, P = 0.002). Cumulative corticosteroid dose was a 
      significant predictor of reduced BMD. BMD did not correlate with measures of
      calcium homeostasis, except elevated serum phosphate and urine calcium levels in 
      girls. CONCLUSIONS: Low BMD occurs in children with IBD (more in Crohn's disease 
      than in ulcerative colitis), especially pubertal and postpubertal girls.
      Cumulative corticosteroid dose is a predictor of low BMD, but other factors in
      Crohn's disease remain undetermined.

TI  - Use of acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: a prospective
      study and the risk of symptomatic diverticular disease in men.
PG  - 255-60
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine prospectively the relationship between self-reported
      regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen
      and the risk of symptomatic diverticular disease. DESIGN: Prospective cohort
      study using a mailed baseline questionnaire in 1986, and follow-up every 2 years 
      through 1992. SETTING: Male health professionals residing in 50 US states.
      PATIENTS: A total of 35 615 male health professionals (dentists, optometrists,
      veterinarians, physicians, pharmacists, osteopathic physicians, podiatrists) 40
      to 75 years of age at baseline and free of diagnosed diverticular disease, colon 
      or rectal polyp, ulcerative colitis, and cancer prior to 1988. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURES: Follow-up questionnaires in 1988, 1990, and 1992 about use of NSAIDs,
      acetaminophen, and other variables including the diagnosis of symptomatic
      diverticular disease. RESULTS: During 4 years of follow-up, we documented 310
      newly diagnosed cases of symptomatic diverticular disease. After adjustment for
      age, physical activity, and energy-adjusted dietary fiber and total fat intake,
      regular and consistent use of NSAIDs and acetaminophen was positively associated 
      with the overall risk of symptomatic diverticular disease (for users vs nonusers,
      relative risk [RR] for NSAIDs = 2.24, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-3.91; RR
      for acetaminophen = 1.81, 95% CI, 0.79-4.11). Most of this positive association
      was attributable to cases associated with bleeding, particularly for
      acetaminophen (for users vs nonusers, RR for NSAIDs = 4.64, 95% CI, 0.99-21.74;
      RR for acetaminophen = 13.63, 95% CI, 3.53-52.60). CONCLUSIONS: These results
      suggest that regular and consistent use of NSAIDs in general and acetaminophen is
      associated with symptoms of severe diverticular disease, particularly bleeding.
      Further research is needed to investigate the potentially deleterious effect of
      NSAIDs and other medications on the lower gastrointestinal tract.

TI  - Serum leptin in children and young adults with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 500-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease is often associated with growth 
      failure and inadequate energy intake. Although several circulating cytokines are 
      known to be elevated in inflammatory bowel disease, the mechanism for the related
      anorexia has not been described. Leptin is a newly recognized circulating protein
      that is an important regulator of appetite and energy metabolism; leptin levels
      are elevated in several animal models of inflammation. This study was conducted
      to determine whether serum leptin levels are elevated in young patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: One hundred twelve children and young adults
      with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis were studied prospectively. Forty-two 
      patients with other gastrointestinal illnesses were used as control subjects.
      Height, weight, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum albumin concentration, and 
      clinical information were collected prospectively, and leptin was measured by
      radioimmunoassay of stored serum. RESULTS: No significant differences in leptin
      levels were found among disease groups or control subjects. Body mass index and
      gender were the only independent predictors of serum leptin in all groups
      examined. Disease activity varied inversely with serum leptin in patients with
      Crohn's disease, but these differences were explained entirely by variations in
      body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: The determinants of serum leptin were the same in
      young patients with inflammatory bowel disease as in normal populations,
      indicating that alterations in leptin levels are unlikely to mediate the anorexia
      and growth failure associated with this disease.

TI  - Nutritional factors in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 235-7
AB  - During the past 20 years there has been growing interest in the importance of
      nutritional factors in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. There are 
      so far no definite links between ulcerative colitis and diet, but links with
      Crohn's disease have been studied by both epidemiologists and clinicians.
      Epidemiological studies, although retrospective, have suggested that patients
      with Crohn's disease eat more sugar and sweets that control individuals; however,
      when dietary sugar is restricted, there is little clinical benefit. The clinical 
      approach to nutrition in Crohn's disease has been by the use of elemental diets, 
      which will produce symptomatic and objective remission in up to 90% of compliant 
      patients. Those who return to normal eating soon relapse but, in some studies,
      have enjoyed prolonged remission on exclusion diets. The foods excluded have been
      not sugar, but predominantly cereals, dairy products and yeast. Attention has now
      switched to the possible harmful role of fat in Crohn's disease. The efficacy of 
      elemental feeds appears to depend not on the presentation of nitrogen but on the 
      amount of long chain triglyceride present. Increases in recent years in the
      frequency of Crohn's disease in Japan have been correlated with increased dietary
      fat intake, and a recent study suggested that W-3 fatty acids, which are
      metabolized by immunomodulatory leukotrienes and prostaglandins, may have a
      beneficial role to play. The links between nutrition and Crohn's disease have now
      become strong and the role of fat may be the most exciting of all.

TI  - A prospective study of dietary fiber types and symptomatic diverticular disease
      in men.
PG  - 714-9
AB  - To examine prospectively dietary fiber calculated from food composition values
      based on analytic techniques and specific dietary fiber types in relation to risk
      of diverticular disease, we analyzed data from a prospective cohort of 43,881
      U.S. male health professionals 40-75 y of age at base line; subjects were free of
      diagnosed diverticular disease, colon or rectal polyps, ulcerative colitis and
      cancer. The insoluble component of fiber was inversely associated with risk of
      diverticular disease relative risk (RR) = 0. 63, 95% confidence interval (CI),
      0.44-0.91, P for trend = 0.02, and this association was particularly strong for
      cellulose (RR = 0.52, 95% CI, 0.36-0.75, P for trend = 0.002). The association
      between diverticular disease and total dietary fiber intake calculated from the
      AOACstandards method was not appreciably different from results using the
      Southgate or Englyst method [for AOAC method, RR = 0.60, 95% CI, 0.41-0.87; for
      Southgate method, RR = 0.61, 95% CI, 0.42-0. 88; for Englyst method, RR = 0.60,
      95% CI, 0.42-0.87, for the highest quintiles]. Our findings provide evidence for 
      the hypothesis that a diet high in dietary fiber decreases the risk of
      diverticular disease, and this result was not sensitive to the use of different
      analytic techniques to define dietary fiber. Our findings suggest that the
      insoluble component of fiber was significantly associated with a decreased risk
      of diverticular disease, and this inverse association was particularly strong for
      cellulose.

TI  - [Inflammatory bowel disease: importance of nutrition today].
PG  - 289-98
AB  - Malnutrition is a very common situation in patients inflammatory with intestinal 
      disease (IID), which can be caused by a multitude of factors. It has been shown
      that nutritional support not only improves the nutritional condition of the
      patients, but in Crohn's disease it also has an effect on the activity of the
      disease, although this effect is smaller than that of steroids. Elemental diets
      are no more efficient than polymeric diets except under very special
      circumstances, but they are more expensive and patients tolerate them worse. A
      digestive pause is not recommended unless there is an absolute contraindication
      for the use of the digestive tract. Therefore, parenteral nutrition, which is
      more expensive and can cause serious complications, will be reserved for very
      specific indications. The use of fish oil supplements, either because it competes
      with arachidonic acid and prevents the initiation of the inflammatory cascade, or
      because it decreases the production of cytokines, has shown to be potentially
      useful in inflammatory intestinal disease, and this must be confirmed by further 
      studies. Short chain fatty acids enemas have shown promising results in distal
      ulcerative colitis but the lack of homogeneity in the studies makes it necessary 
      for these results to be consolidated in new studies. Nutritional support is
      especially interesting in children with inflammatory intestinal disease given
      that the growth retardation which is often seen in severe cases, can be
      controlled by adequate enteral or parenteral diets.

TI  - Nutritional issues and therapy in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 21-30
AB  - Nutritional issues in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) often receive inadequate
      attention both in regard to therapy and nutritionally related complications of
      IBD. This article reviews much of the research that has evaluated the role of
      diet in the causation, primary treatment, and adjunctive therapy of both
      ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Benefits have been demonstrated
      in the use of elemental diets or polymeric diets in CD in both acute flare up or 
      maintenance of IBD. A careful team approach can overcome problems in implementing
      nutritional therapy. Nutrition also has a critical benefit in postoperative CD
      and perioperative UC. Numerous easily corrected, nutritional abnormalities are
      often overlooked in patients with IBD, which may have significant consequences.
      Nutritional therapy may have a central place in the hierarchy of treatment in IBD
      and further research is critical in this area to better define the benefits of
      nutrition in IBD.

PG  - 318-21
AB  - We report about a forty year old female patient with severe bloody diarrhoea and 
      fever over a period of 14 days due to an infection with Salmonella enteritidis.
      X-ray of the abdomen showed a toxic megacolon. With the diagnosis of an
      infectious colitis we started therapy with ciprofloxacin i/v. The toxic megacolon
      progressed despite intensive care and parenteral nutrition. Additionally the
      patient received metronidazole i/v and in combination with a roll technique in
      bed in the knee-elbow-position the leucocytosis and the megacolon decreased. A
      toxic megacolon is in about 3% associated with an infection with Salmonella
      enteritidis. It is essentially diagnosed by X-ray. Patients should receive
      intensive care, and because of the high mortality rate an interdisciplinary
      management is required. The article discusses the major differential diagnosis of
      the toxic megacolon, as well as the pathogenesis and therapy of Salmonella ent,
      infection. In case of an infection with Salmonella ent. physicians should
      acknowledge the possibility of development of a toxic megacolon.

TI  - Bone mineral density and nutritional status in children with chronic inflammatory
      bowel disease.
PG  - 188-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis has been reported in adult patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease. AIMS: To evaluate bone mineral density (BMD), nutritional status, 
      and determinants of BMD in children with inflammatory bowel disease. PATIENTS:
      Fifty five patients (34 boys and 21 girls, age range 4-18) were studied; 22 had
      Crohn's disease and 33 ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Lumbar spine and total body
      BMD, and body composition were assessed by dual energy x ray absorptiometry
      (DXA). Results were expressed as standard deviation scores (SDS). Lean body mass 
      was also assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Yearly measurements 
      during two years were performed in 21 patients. RESULTS: The mean SDS of lumbar
      spine BMD and total body BMD were significantly lower than normal (-0.75 and
      -0.95, both p < 0.001). Height SDS and body mass index SDS were also decreased.
      The decrease in BMD SDS could not be explained by delay in bone maturation. The
      cumulative dose of prednisolone correlated negatively with lumbar spine BMD SDS
      (r = -0.32, p < 0.02). Body mass index SDS correlated positively with total body 
      BMD SDS (r = 0.36, p < 0.02). Patients with Crohn's disease had significantly
      lower lumbar spine and total body BMD SDS than patients with ulcerative colitis, 
      even after adjustment for cumulative dose of prednisolone. In the longitudinal
      data cumulative dose of prednisolone between the measurements correlated
      negatively with the change in lumbar spine and total body BMD SDS. Lean tissue
      mass measured by DXA had a strong correlation with lean body mass measured by BIA
      (r = 0.98). CONCLUSIONS: Children with inflammatory bowel disease have a
      decreased BMD. Children with Crohn's disease have a higher risk of developing
      osteopaenia than children with ulcerative colitis. Corticosteroid therapy and
      nutritional status are important determinants of BMD in these patients.

      levels of selected micronutrients].
PG  - 674-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Optimal saturation of organism by micronutrients--vitamins and trace 
      elements--has a significant inhibitory effect on the origin and development of
      malign diseases. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate the blood
      levels of A, C and E vitamins, Beta-carotene, zinc, and selenium in 249 patients 
      with precanceroses (atrophic gastritis, hyperplastic polyp of the stomach,
      adenomas of the stomach and colorectum, ulcerative colitis), 96 patients with
      carcinoma of the stomach or colorectum, and to compare them with a control group 
      of 130 people. RESULTS: We have discovered the frequency of decreased average
      levels of micronutrients in patients with precanceroses as follows: vitamin C >
      vitamins E and A > selenium > beta carotene. In all groups of patients with
      carcinoma the average levels of vitamins and Beta-carotene were significantly
      decreased, the level of selenium has decreased only in the group of gastric
      carcinoma. The copper level was increased in the group of ulcerative colitis and 
      in all groups with carcinoma. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that in the
      primary prevention of these malign diseases it is necessary to improve the levels
      of the presented micronutrients in the population of the Slovak Republic by
      increasing the intake of fruit, vegetables and other sources of nutrition, the
      secondary prevention in persons with precanceroses requires an appropriate
      intermittent supplementation of micronutrients (chemoprevention). (Tab. 3, Ref.
      24.)

TI  - Activated protein C resistance in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 172-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is evidence for a hypercoagulable state in inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD), and small vessel thrombosis has been identified in the bowel of
      patients with Crohn's disease, suggesting thrombosis as a possible etiologic
      factor. Activated protein C (APC) resistance is the most common inherited
      disorder leading to thrombosis and accounts for 30% to 40% of episodes of
      idiopathic venous thrombosis. METHODS: The prevalence of APC resistance was
      studied in 23 patients with IBD (17 with Crohn's disease, 6 with ulcerative
      colitis) and in 11 control subjects with recurrent abdominal pain or celiac
      disease, using an APC resistance screening method. RESULTS: One patient with
      Crohn's disease had a positive screen result, two patients (one with Crohn's, one
      with ulcerative colitis) had borderline results, and results in all of the
      control subjects were normal. One patient with Crohn's disease had a history of a
      thromboembolic event but had a normal screen result. CONCLUSIONS: Activated
      protein C resistance does not seem to play a major role in the etiology of the
      hypercoagulable state in inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Vitamins A and E serum levels in children and young adults with inflammatory
      bowel disease: effect of disease activity.
PG  - 129-35
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypovitaminosis and fat-soluble vitamin deficiency have been reported
      in adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A prospective study was
      undertaken to determine the prevalence of low serum levels of vitamins A and E in
      children and young adults with IBD. METHODS: Clinical information and serum for
      vitamin levels was gathered prospectively from 61 patients with Crohn's disease, 
      36 patients with ulcerative colitis, and 23 control subjects. Disease activity
      and disease location were determined for IBD patients. Serum retinol and
      alpha-tocopherol levels were determined by high-performance liquid
      chromatography. RESULTS: The prevalence of hypovitaminosis A (defined as serum
      vitamin A < 20 micrograms/dl) or hypovitaminosis E (defined as serum vitamin E < 
      5 mg/l) was 16% in the pediatric IBD population studied. Low vitamin A levels
      were more common than low vitamin E levels. Serum retinol levels correlated
      significantly with alpha-tocopherol levels. Hypovitaminosis was significantly
      more prevalent in the Crohn's disease patients who had active disease, an
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate of more than 25 mm/hour, or a serum albumin level 
      less than 3 mg/dl. CONCLUSIONS: Children and young adults with active IBD
      frequently have low serum levels of vitamin A or vitamin E. The severity of
      disease activity is a better predictor of risk for hypovitaminosis than is
      nutritional status. Further work is necessary to determine whether the
      hypovitaminosis seen in children with IBD reflects true deficiency.

TI  - Metabolic characteristics of healthy adult males as affected by ingestion of a
      liquid nutritional formula containing fish oil, oligosaccharides, gum arabic and 
      antioxidant vitamins.
PG  - 1165-76
AB  - n-3 Fatty acids from fish oil and short-chain fatty acids produced from
      fermentation of oligosaccharides may attenuate a portion of gut injury and
      inflammation associated with ulcerative colitis. The purpose of this study was to
      assess the effects of an enteral nutritional formula containing supplemental
      oligosaccharides, gum arabic and fish oil on serum metabolite profiles,
      haematology, plasma and red blood cell membrane phospholipid fatty acid profiles,
      urinary constituent, and safety in healthy human adult males. 30 subjects were
      randomly assigned to one of two treatments, a control formula (n = 10) and an
      ulcerative colitis nutritional formula (UCNF; n = 20). Formulas contained
      comparable levels of protein, fat and non-structural carbohydrates. Daily intake 
      of the formulas provided nutrients to meet or exceed the recommended daily
      allowance. Intake was recorded daily while blood and urine samples were collected
      weekly on days 0, 7 and 14. Certain subjects consuming large quantities of the
      UCNF experienced some abdominal distention, gas and loose stools. Sole source
      intake of the UCNF was safe over 14 days as assessed by routine measurements of
      serum metabolite profiles, haematology and urinalysis compared with subjects fed 
      the control formula. Substantial decreases in plasma and red blood cell
      phospholipid 18:2n-6 and increases in 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 within 1 wk of feeding 
      the UCNF were noted.

TI  - Nitric oxide and inflammatory bowel disease: evidence for local intestinal
      production in children with active colonic disease.
PG  - 34-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Active colitis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease is
      associated with mucosal vasodilation, increased intestinal permeability and
      abnormal colonic motility. Nitric oxide is a messenger molecule with many
      functions, including regulation of local blood flow, vasomotor tone, and
      inflammation. Increased nitric oxide production and inducible nitric oxide
      synthase activity have been demonstrated in experimental models of colitis. This 
      study was designed to determine the relationship between nitric oxide production 
      and colonic inflammation in children with active colitis and in control subjects 
      and whether expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase protein is demonstrable
      in the intestinal epithelium of these patients. METHODS: Nitrate + nitrite were
      measured in urine, stool, and plasma using the Griess assay. Expression of
      inducible nitric oxide synthase protein in intestinal tissue was determined by
      immunohistochemical localization. RESULTS: Urinary nitrate + nitrite levels were 
      not significantly different in patients and control subjects. In contrast, stool 
      and plasma nitrate + nitrite concentrations were significantly higher in children
      with inflammatory bowel disease compared with levels in control children (stool: 
      162.4 +/- 31.0 mumol/l versus 77.2 +/- 22.1 mumol/l; plasma: 65.2 +/- 9.9 mumol/l
      versus 38.1 +/- 6.6 mumol/L; p < 0.05). Stool nitrate + nitrite levels
      significantly correlated with plasma values. Immunohistochemical staining of
      colonic tissue from children with inflammatory bowel disease demonstrated
      inducible nitric oxide synthase protein located exclusively in epithelial cells. 
      CONCLUSION: Increased nitric oxide production and enhanced intestinal epithelial 
      cell expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase protein are associated with
      active colonic inflammation.

PG  - 813-25
AB  - The aim of this study was to clarify factors influencing the induction of
      remission and to compare the short term remission rate of EN with that of TPN.
      From 1985 to 1992, 87 active patients treated for more than 4 weeks with EN and
      71 active patients treated with TPN were analysed. Excluding the case with severe
      complications (abdominal abscess, external fistula, sub-ileus), 132 patients were
      divided to two groups (patients with remission and non-remission) based on
      clinical response to the treatment. Remission was defined as Crohn's disease
      activity index (CDAI) < 150 and ESR < 20 mm/hr after 4 weeks of treatment.
      Clinical characteristics and radiographic findings were compared between the two 
      groups. Furthermore, a multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to
      clarify the relative importance of various clinical or radiographic factors
      associated with remission. Remission rate at four weeks with EN was 77% and that 
      with TPN was 62%. By a multiple logistic regression analysis using 15 factors,
      which were significant by a single variable analysis, four factors (times of
      previous nutritional treatment, IOIBD, WBC, polyposis score of the colon) in EN
      cases and three factors (ESR, platelets, extent of Crohn's disease) in TPN cases 
      were selected as independent prognostic factors after adjusting for the effect of
      other factors. Moreover, mode of therapy was not selected as a valuable factor.
      From the above mentioned results, it was concluded that EN and TPN were
      equivalent in the efficacy of short-term therapy and patients having had several 
      previous nutritional therapy, high IOIBD score, high WBC count, severe
      cobblestoning of the colon were tended to be resistant to EN therapy and high ESR
      value, high platelet count, broader extent of Crohn's disease were tended to be
      resistant to TPN therapy. Both clinical and radiographic features are important
      prognostic factors in predicting response to nutritional therapy.

TI  - [Ulcerative colitis: activity of antioxidant enzymes of the colonic mucosa].
PG  - 1474-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Reactive oxygen species are regarded as mediators of inflammation in 
      ulcerative colitis. Antioxidant enzymes are the primary defense against reactive 
      oxygen species. We investigated the activities of antioxidant enzymes-superoxide 
      dismutase, catalase and glutathion peroxidase-in colonic mucosa biopsy specimens 
      obtained at different phases of the disease in patients given vitamin E therapy
      or not and in controls. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Biopsy specimens were obtained from
      29 patients with ulcerative colitis and from 18 healthy controls. Ten patients on
      maintenance drug therapy were also given a 300 mg daily oral dose of vitamin E.
      RESULTS: Enzyme activities were significantly increased in inflamed non-polypous 
      colonic mucosa in patients with active ulcerative colitis, while they were
      similar to activities observed in controls during quiescent phases of the
      disease. Antioxidant enzyme activities in specimens from inflammatory polyps
      remained high even in patients in clinical remission. Administration of vitamin E
      resulted in a significant reduction of glutathion peroxidase activity in the
      colonic mucosa. CONCLUSION: These findings indirectly confirm that important
      quantities of reactive oxygen species are formed in ulcerative colitis. Further
      studies are needed to elucidate the relationship of these changes with the
      pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis.

PG  - 453-5
AB  - Retroperitoneal colonic perforation in patients with ulcerative colitis is rare. 
      We report such a case in a patient with severe ulcerative colitis without toxic
      dilatation in whom mediastinal and subcutaneous emphysema also developed. Unlike 
      previously reported cases, our patient was treated conservatively with
      intravenous fluids, parenteral nutrition, intravenous hydrocortisone, and
      antibiotics. After 2 weeks, the mediastinal and subcutaneous emphysema and the
      retroperitoneal air completely disappeared.

TI  - Gallbladder motility and cholecystokinin secretion during continuous enteral
      nutrition.
PG  - 2274-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: During total parenteral nutrition, gallbladder motility is impaired, 
      resulting in sludge and stone formation. Little is known about gallbladder
      motility during prolonged enteral nutrition. METHODS: We studied gallbladder
      motility during continuous enteral nutrition (CEN) in nine hospitalized patients 
      with active inflammatory bowel disease. The patients received a polymeric diet
      (2000 kcal/24 h) by CEN through a nasogastric tube for a prolonged period.
      Gallbladder volumes were obtained daily by ultrasonography, starting from day 0
      (before CEN) and on 7 consecutive days during CEN. At days 0, 1, 4, and 7, the
      gallbladder response to i.v. cholecystokinin (CCK-33; 0.5 Ivy Dog unit/kg/h) was 
      studied. Plasma CCK levels were determined at regular intervals by
      radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed on day 0
      between patients and a group of nine healthy control subjects in fasting
      gallbladder volumes (19.4 +/- 2.3 and 19.6 +/- 2.4 cm3, respectively) and
      gallbladder contraction during CCK infusion (56 +/- 14% and 69 +/- 7%,
      respectively). During CEN, from day 1 to day 7, mean gallbladder volume remained 
      significantly (p < 0.05) reduced compared with fasting gallbladder volume, and
      mean plasma CCK levels remained significantly (p < 0.05) increased compared with 
      fasting levels. Although gallbladder volume was significantly reduced during CEN,
      the gallbladder contractile response to CCK was not affected; at days 1, 4, and
      7, gallbladder contraction was 36-57%. CONCLUSIONS: During CEN, 1) gallbladder
      volume is significantly reduced and plasma CCK levels are significantly
      increased, 2) these effects are sustained over time (7 days), and 3) the
      gallbladder remains responsive to exogenous CCK. These results indicate that
      gallbladder contractility and gallbladder responsiveness to CCK are preserved
      during prolonged CEN in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Intractable diarrhoea associated with secondary amyloidosis in rheumatoid
      arthritis.
PG  - 535-41
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical characteristics of intractable diarrhoea
      associated with secondary amyloidosis in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Of
      179 RA patients with biopsy confirmed secondary amyloidosis, 24 cases (23 women
      and one man) with intractable diarrhoea lasting for more than one month were
      retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: The mean (SD) duration of diarrhoea was 87
      (64) days. Prodromal symptoms of gastrointestinal dysfunction (n = 21) and
      impaired peristalsis (n = 16) were observed. Laboratory data showed
      hypoproteinaemia (4.7 (0.85) g/dl) caused by malabsorption or protein loss and
      high values of C reactive protein (17.0 (9.3) mg/dl). Recurrence of intractable
      diarrhoea (n = 4) and transition from intractable diarrhoea to other
      gastrointestinal problems of amyloidosis (ischaemic colitis (n = 2) and
      intestinal pseudo-obstruction (n = 4)) were observed. In 19 patients (25
      episodes) the duration of intravenous hyperalimentation at remission (18
      episodes) was 68 (52) days. Corticosteroid pulse therapy was administered to 10
      patients (11 times) and the time elapsed from the end of corticosteroid pulse
      therapy to the end of diarrhoea was 18 (14) days. One and five year survival
      rates after the onset of intractable diarrhoea were 73.4% and 38.9%. Seven of 13 
      patients (54%) had died as a result of infectious diseases. CONCLUSION:
      Intractable diarrhoea associated with secondary amyloidosis in RA is a serious
      clinical entity and the prognosis is poor. Although it is assumed that
      intravenous hyperalimentation treatment and corticosteroid pulse therapy are
      favourable regimens for intractable diarrhoea, the patients should be monitored
      for possible infectious complications.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease: a study of the association between anxiety and
      depression, physical morbidity, and nutritional status.
PG  - 1013-21
AB  - BACKGROUND: The etiology of inflammatory bowel disease is unclear, and the role
      played by anxiety and depression is highly controversial. Anxiety and depression 
      in patients with inflammatory bowel disease could be secondary to disabling
      symptoms, but the interaction between physical morbidity and psychologic illness 
      in these subjects has not been sufficiently investigated. Patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease are nevertheless frequently undernourished, but there 
      are no studies on the association between anxiety and depression and
      malnutrition. This study was designed to characterize anxiety and depression in
      subjects affected by inflammatory bowel disease and to establish the influence of
      physical morbidity and/or nutritional status on psychologic disorders. METHODS:
      Seventy-nine consecutive patients, 43 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 36 with
      ulcerative colitis (UC), were enrolled in the study. An index of the disease
      activity and physical morbidity was obtained by the simplified Crohn's Disease
      Activity Index and Truelove-Witts criteria and using the Clinical Rating Scale.
      Thirty-six healthy volunteers were studied as controls. All the subjects were
      given the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) test and the Zung self-rating 
      Depression Scale. RESULTS: The percentage of subjects with state anxiety was
      significantly higher in the CD (P < 0.001) and UC (P < 0.001) groups than in
      control subjects. There was no significant difference in trait anxiety among
      groups. The percentage of subjects with depression was significantly higher in
      the CD (P < 0.05) and UC (P < 0.05) groups than in control subjects. State
      anxiety and depression were significantly associated with physical morbidity and 
      correlated with malnutrition in CD and UC patients. CONCLUSION: Anxiety and
      depression in patients with inflammatory bowel disease could be reactive to the
      disabling symptoms and to malnutrition. As measured with the STAI, personality
      trait of anxiety does not seem to play an important role in inflammatory bowel
      disease.

TI  - Antiinflammatory effects of human milk on chemically induced colitis in rats.
PG  - 639-43
AB  - We examined the effects of a human milk diet on rats with chemical colitis
      induced with a 4% acetic acid enema. Colonic myeloperoxidase activity was used as
      a surrogate marker for neutrophil infiltration. Control rats fed rat chow had
      little colonic myeloperoxidase activity; geometric mean, 0.27 U/g of tissue. Rats
      with colitis fed rat chow had significantly increased colonic myeloperoxidase
      activity (geometric mean, 6.76 U/g, p < 0.01 versus no colitis), as did rats with
      colitis fed infant formula or Pedialyte (geometric mean, 6.92 and 8.13 U/g,
      respectively, both p < 0.01 versus no colitis). Animals with colitis fed human
      milk had significantly lower colonic myeloperoxidase activity (geometric mean,
      2.34 U/g) than did animals with colitis fed either chow or infant formula (p <
      0.001). Similar effects were seen in rats with colitis fed infant formula
      supplemented with recombinant human IL-1 receptor antagonist (geometric mean,
      1.95 U/g). These data show that orally administered human milk has an
      antiinflammatory effect on chemically induced colitis in rats, which may be
      mediated in part by IL-1 receptor antagonist contained in human milk.

TI  - Assessment and management of ulcerative colitis in children.
PG  - 858-63
AB  - The incidence of ulcerative colitis in school-age children in most parts of
      Europe has been steady at 1.5-2.0 per 100,000 children per year for the last
      20-30 years. In comparison to adults, abdominal pain is a relatively frequent
      presenting symptom in children in addition to rectal bleeding, bloody diarrhoea
      or diarrhoea. Distribution of disease in children is generally more extensive
      (ratio rectal:left sided:extensive 25:30:45). There are remarkably few clinical
      trials of therapy in children and reasons for this are discussed. Subjective
      indices of disease severity and activity are unreliable in children. Objective
      measures such as endoscopy are of value to define the extent of ulceration and
      histopathological features; a test of gut protein loss using whole gut lavage
      gives an objective index of disease activity. Principles of medical management in
      children are generally the same as in adults with the additional need for
      scrupulous attention to nutrition and growth, and psychological factors.
      Reassuring results of a review of the health status of young adults who had
      developed ulcerative colitis in childhood are presented. Twenty-four of 27
      considered themselves fully fit although nine of the patients had a permanent
      ileostomy.

TI  - The modern medical management of acute, severe ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 831-5
AB  - The management of patients with acute, severe ulcerative colitis requires careful
      in-hospital assessment of the patient and the coordinated treatment of a team of 
      experienced gastroenterologists and surgeons. Complete understanding of the
      potential complications and their management, especially toxic megacolon, is
      essential. We review the current medical arsenal and advocate a standardized
      approach to management that includes continuous, high dose intravenous
      hydrocortisone, more aggressive use of topical steroids as well as feeding the
      patients and continuing (but not initiating) oral 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA)
      agents. For those patients whose disease proves refractory to intravenous
      steroids, intravenous cyclosporin (with an acute response rate of 82%) is an
      essential component in the medical management of these patients. Antibiotics
      should be used only when specifically indicated. Total parenteral nutrition has
      not been shown to be helpful in the acute setting. Air contrast barium enema and 
      colonoscopy have been used to predict response but may be dangerous diagnostic
      modalities in these acutely ill patients and are no better than good clinical
      judgement. We review and advocate long-term management of acute response using
      6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine. The surgical experience and the postoperative
      complications of the ileal pouch anal anastomosis, which include acute pouchitis 
      in 50-60%, chronic pouchitis in 5-10% and recent reports of dysplasia among
      patients with chronic pouchitis, must be considered before colectomy is advised. 
      Over 80% of patients with acute severe colitis can be spared colectomy using our 
      current arsenal of medical therapies.

TI  - [Nutrition in the etiopathogenesis of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases].
PG  - 637-49
AB  - It is currently held that the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      involves a complex interaction of host responses, some immunologic and
      genetically determined, and external influences including microbial and dietary
      factors. Nutritional surveys and studies testing stepwise exclusion dietary
      compounds have suggested that dietary factors might be linked to the occurrence
      of IBD. Food allergy was suggested early as a possible trigger for the
      inflammatory response; however, no firm evidence has been gathered over the years
      to substantiate this possibility. The possibility that patients with Crohn's
      disease may have an unusual premorbid pattern of dietary intake has also been
      examined since the early seventies. Several groups of investigators report a high
      intake of refined sugars (i.e. sucrose), recycled cooking oil, a more frequent
      consumption of fast foods in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis
      respectively. However, a critical comparison of incidence and prevalence studies 
      published from 1976 until 1994 clearly showed no pre-existing nutritional
      abnormality that has been identified consistently in patients who develop
      inflammatory bowel disease.

PG  - 819-20
AB  - We report a case of a 62-year-old man who developed watery diarrhoea after
      starting treatment with cimetidine for dyspepsia. Macroscopically, sigmoidoscopy 
      and colonoscopy were normal. Histology revealed features consistent with a
      diagnosis of collagenous colitis. The diarrhoea is responding to treatment with
      prednisolone and withdrawal of cimetidine. We conclude that the collagenous
      colitis may have been drug induced.

TI  - Modulatory effects of the colonic milieu on neutrophil oxidative burst: a
      possible pathogenic mechanism of ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 216-25
AB  - An important hallmark of ulcerative colitis (UC) is mucosal neutrophil (PMN)
      infiltration associated with mucosal damage. This suggests that colonic
      chemoattractants such as bacterial products (e.g.,
      N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP), lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) reach
      systemic circulation and attract PMNs to the colon. PMNs are then activated in
      the colonic mucosa and release their toxic oxidative metabolites. However,
      bacterial products are also present in the systemic circulation of healthy
      subjects. Thus we hypothesized that PMNs develop tolerance to colonic factors in 
      the normal state and that this tolerance is absent in UC. We evaluated the PMN
      respiratory burst in response to stimulation with fMLP, LPS, or phorbol
      12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) by measuring the production of reactive oxygen
      species (ROS) with both luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence and a cytochrome C
      reduction assay. PMNs were obtained from control subjects, inactive UC patients, 
      patients with UC who had undergone colectomies, and non-UC patients with
      colectomies. All three stimuli induced a significant rise in ROS. PMNs from
      non-UC colectomy subjects produced significantly higher ROS than PMNs from
      control subjects with intact colons in response to both fMLP and LPS. In
      contrast, PMNs from UC colectomy patients produced levels of ROS similar to those
      produced by PMNs from UC patients with intact colons in response to fMLP and LPS.
      Colectomy had no effect on PMA-induced ROS production in controls. The observed
      difference in fMLP-induced ROS production in control subjects with intact colons 
      was not due to fMLP receptor down-regulation because a competition assay
      performed with the fMLP blocker BMLP showed a similar receptor apparent affinity 
      in all four groups. We conclude the following: (1) the normal colonic milieu
      modulates the PMN respiratory burst, resulting in hyporesponsiveness of PMNs to
      "physiologic" but not "pharmacologic" stimulation. This effect is not due to
      receptor down-regulation. (2) UC colonic milieu does not appear to modulate PMN
      respiratory burst. This loss of PMN "tolerance" to colonic factors may have a
      pathogenic role in the sustained inflammation and tissue damage in UC.

TI  - The use of glutamine in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders in man.
PG  - 743-7
AB  - The human gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is a major site of glutamine utilisation
      accounting for more than half of the net splanchnic utilisation (approximately 15
      g/day) of glutamine obtained from the systemic circulation. Dietary glutamine
      (approximately 5 g/day) is less important than circulating glutamine, especially 
      in disease conditions associated with substantial reduction in food intake.
      Glutamine has multiple effects on the structure and function of the GIT, and
      effects in improving morbidity and mortality in animal models of GIT damage has
      led to a series of studies in man, which have produced variable results.
      Glutamine administration to treat mucositis of the upper GIT (mouth, oesophagus) 
      due to cytotoxic drug therapy, has produced no evidence of benefit. Early studies
      suggested improved healing, as do recent studies of small intestinal mucositis
      resulting from chemotherapy. Investigations in colitis are lacking although in
      experimental rat models of colitis no benefit has been reported. Multiple
      explanations can be put forward to explain the overall results, including the GIT
      distribution of enzymes involved in glutamine metabolism. Apart from the lower
      stomach in man (upper stomach in the rat) there is very little weak activity of
      glutamine synthetase, suggesting that the gut derives glutamine formed in other
      tissues and from the diet. The activity of glutaminase, which is key flux
      generating enzyme involved in glutaminolysis is very weak in mucosa with
      stratified squamous epithelium (oesophagus), where intermediate in the same
      intestine, and highest in the small intestinal mucosa which accounts for about
      80% of the total glutaminase in the entire human GIT mucosa.

TI  - [New therapeutic possibilities in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases].
PG  - 1071-4
AB  - New therapeutic measures in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are either based on
      actual data on disease pathogenesis or on new pharmaceutic preparations of known 
      drugs. An overshooting immune response with T cell activation in the local gut
      associated immune system seems to be central in the etiopathogenesis of IBD.
      Modulation of the antigenic load in the gut lumen by parenteral or enteral
      nutrition or antibiotic treatment can alter disease activity. Immunosuppressive
      drugs are able to decrease the overshooting immune response. Azathioprin has its 
      clear value in chronic active steroid dependent disease courses of Crohn's
      disease. According to recent studies, Methotrexate seems to be active as well,
      however, more studies are necessary. Several studies were not able to prove that 
      Cyclosporine is of value in the treatment of Crohn's disease. Newer preparations 
      of aminosalicylates have shown effectiveness in both active disease and
      prolongation of remission in Crohn's disease in high doses. Local release
      formulations of steroids with high first-pass-effect as Budesonide will have
      their indication in subgroups of IBD patients. However, systemic steroid
      application is still the gold standard in active disease.

OAB - A dysentery outbreak in the Central African Republic village of Zemio was
      diagnosed as "Shigella flexneri" by the Pasteur Institute in Bangui (IPB) in
      February 1996; 2 months later there was an outbreak of hemorrhagic colitis. 108
      patients presented with bloody diarrhea; cramping abdominal pain, fever, nausea, 
      and vomiting were uncommon. The illness lasted between 5 days and 3 weeks
      (average, 8 days). Antibiotics were ineffective. Four patients died and several
      developed hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Stool cultures done at IPB tested negative. 
      PCR was used to detect enterohemorrhagic Shiga-like toxin (SLT) 1 and 2, the
      invasivity gene ipaH, and the attaching and effacing gene eaeA. DNA fragments of 
      130 and 494 nucleotides corresponding to amplified SLT1 and eaeA were found in
      80% of the specimens tested. No amplification was obtained for SLT2 or for ipaH
      in specimens collected during the second epidemic. These results suggest the
      presence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and the absence of Shigella. The
      number of reported cases of acute bloody diarrhea in infants and adults in Bangui
      has increased since 1996. E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from two fatal adult
      cases. Smoked zebu meat was suspected in several hospital cases (bloody diarrhea,
      hemolytic anemia, and renal insufficiency) in which non-fermenting sorbitol E.
      coli O157:H7 was not isolated. In two cases of acute diarrhea, other serotypes of
      E. coli were indicated by retrospective PCR on stools which were positive for
      SLT1 and for eaeA and negative for invasivity. A study was conducted in Bangui on
      290 cases (33 with bloody diarrhea) and 140 controls. Patients were not paired
      because of civil unrest in the city. The questionnaire included demographic and
      socioeconomic characteristics, environmental factors, and habitual food
      consumption. The major contributing factor was consumption of locally made meat
      pies (kanda), which were made with smoked zebu meat. Kanda is stored at ambient
      temperature, often for days, before it is sold in markets or along roads. Before 
      1996, E. coli was not reported as a cause of bloody diarrhea in the Central
      African Republic.

TI  - Pre-illness dietary factors in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 754-60
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of environmental factors has been demonstrated in the
      pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Nutrition may be one of them.
      AIM: To investigate the pre-illness diet in patients with recent IBD in
      comparison with matched population and clinic controls. METHODS: Quantified
      dietary histories were obtained from 87 patients with recent IBD (54 ulcerative
      colitis (UC) and 33 Crohn's disease (CD)) and 144 controls. Odds ratios (OR) for 
      IBD were derived for intake levels of various foods. RESULTS: A high sucrose
      consumption was associated with an increased risk for IBD (OR 2.85 (p = 0.03)
      against population controls and 5.3 (p = 0.00) against clinic controls). Lactose 
      consumption showed no effect while fructose intake was negatively associated with
      risk for IBD (NS). Similar trends were noted in UC and CD. A high fat intake was 
      associated with an increased risk for UC; this was particularly marked for animal
      fat (OR 4.09, p = 0.02) and cholesterol (OR 4.57, p = 0.02). A high intake of
      fluids (p = 0.04), magnesium (p = 0.04), vitamin C, and fruits (NS) was
      negatively associated with the risk for IBD, while a positive association was
      found for retinol (p = 0.01). Most of the findings were similar in UC and CD
      except for potassium and vegetable consumption which showed a negative
      association only with risk for CD. CONCLUSIONS: An association was found between 
      pre-illness diet and subsequent development of UC and CD. The effect of dietary
      components may be primary or modulatory.

TI  - Diversion colitis: a cause of abdominal discomfort in spinal cord injury patients
      with colostomy.
PG  - 670-1
AB  - Diversion colitis is thought to result from nutritional deficiencies secondary to
      fecal diversion. Symptoms include hemorrhagic purulent rectal discharge,
      abdominal pain, and tenesmus. 5-Aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) and N-butyrate enemas
      have been reported to help this condition non-spinal cord injury (SCI) patients. 
      We report the case of a 49-year-old C6 ASIA B tetraplegic man who had received
      colostomy because of intractable ileus 10 years earlier. He presented with a
      2-week history of rectal pain and bleeding. Abdominal and rectal examination on
      admission were unremarkable. Colonoscopy showed a partial stricture 70cm
      proximally to the rectum. The colonic mucosa appeared granular and friable with
      evidence of linear ulceration. Histopathologic study was consistent with colitis.
      The patient developed fever, abdominal distention, and extensive retroperitoneal 
      air after endoscopy, suggesting colonic perforation. He was treated with daily
      5-ASA suppository and total parenteral nutrition for the presumed diagnosis of
      diversion colitis, and intravenous antibiotics for perforated colon. After 6
      weeks of treatment with 5-ASA, the patient had decreased rectal pain and
      bleeding. This experience suggests that diversion colitis may be a cause of
      abdominal discomfort in SCI patients and that 5-ASA may be used in the management
      of diversion colitis.

TI  - [Low ileorectal anastomosis in the surgery of ulcerative rectocolitis].
PG  - 337-45
AB  - The authors report their experience of 23 patients with ulcerative colitis
      treated with surgery from 1991 to 1994. At admission 8 patients had a high-grade 
      illness, 10 patients had a middle-grade illness, 5 patients had a toxic
      megacolon. All the patients were treated with systemic medical management
      (mesalazine + methylprednisolone) and topical medical management with rectal
      steroid (methylprednisolone) and rectal mesalazine by enema, and with nutritional
      support (Total Parenteral Nutrition). The 5 patients with toxic megacolon, after 
      48 hours of unsuccessful medical management, underwent surgery with deferred
      urgency; the other 18 patients underwent surgery after one-four months. The
      authors prefer the ileorectal anastomosis (IRA), since the rectal lesions are
      more susceptible to topical therapy. A single-stage IRA was performed in 17
      patients. A sigmoid resection has been employed in the first stage in the 18th
      patient with a local development of the disease in the sigma; a following relapse
      of the lesions required a total colectomy with a low ileorectal anastomosis. A
      first-stage subtotal colectomy with ileostomy and Hartmann closure of the rectum 
      with low ileorectal anastomosis at a later date was performed in the 5 patients
      with toxic megacolon. One of these, 18 years old, died after a heart failure.
      After surgery, as soon as the patients start moving their bowels all of these had
      again a systemic therapy with mesalazine for a short period and after they had a 
      topical therapy with mesalazine + methylprednisolone by enema, for a long period.
      The average postoperative period of admission was 16.3 days. The functional
      results have been encouraging with an average of 1.6 bowel movements daily and an
      average of 0.4 nocturnal bowel movements. All the patients had a normal anal
      sphincter function with an acceptable stool frequency. In male patients there no 
      urinary or sexual defects. In one case of these, there was a low grade of
      dysplasia, revealed by endoscopic biopsy. The authors conclude that today
      surgical treatment of ulcerative colitis is not well established.

TI  - Role of nucleosides and nucleotides in the immune system, gut reparation after
      injury, and brain function.
PG  - 372-4
AB  - Emerging evidence indicates the importance of nucleosides and nucleotides in the 
      maintenance of functions of the bone marrow hematopoietic cells, intestinal
      mucosa, and the brain, which have limited de novo synthesis of purine and
      pyrimidine bases. We have found that nucleosides and nucleotides stimulate
      hemopoieses and increase peripheral neutrophil counts in mice treated with
      cyclophosphoamide. Intraperitoneal administration of nucleosides and nucleotides 
      decreased bacterial translocation, the number of colony-forming units, and
      increased survival against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. In vitro 
      immune studies in mice showed that nucleosides and nucleotides increase the
      delayed-type cutaneous hypersensitivity and the popliteal lymph node blastogenic 
      response to antigens, allogens, and mitogens. Both intraperitoneal and oral
      administration of nucleosides and nucleotides reduced endotoxin-induced bacterial
      translocation and improved injury to the gut in protein-deficient mice. However, 
      oral administration of nucleosides and nucleotides in experimental colitis
      resulted in a worsening of colitic conditions and increased interleukin-8 and
      tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentrations in inflamed colonic portions,
      indicating the pro-inflammatory activities of nucleosides and nucleotides.
      Memory-deficient senescence-accelerated mice and mice with dementia showed
      improved memory with dietary nucleosides and nucleotides supplementation. These
      results indicate that supplementation with nucleosides and nucleotides is
      beneficial to the functions of the system and the brain. However, beneficial
      effects to the gut appear to depend on the type of damage sustained by the gut.

      maintenance therapy, for 38 patients with UC. LCAP could remove approximately 1 x
      10(10) white blood cells in each session. In the evaluation, we classified the
      response to the LCAP as: 1) excellent, 2) moderately improved, 3) no change, and 
      4) deterioration. Clinical improvement was recognized in 29 of 38 patients (76%) 
      including 8 with dramatic response during the intensive therapy, and continued
      throughout the maintenance therapy in 26 patients (68.4%). Even though their
      symptoms were mild, the patients with more than 5 years UC history seemed to be
      not effective. The patients with moderately improvement and with excellent
      response have kept remission for about 20 months and about 2.5 years on an
      average, respectively. Clinical and blood examinations showed no side effects in 
      any cases. It suggests that LCAP is able to be a UC treatment between drug
      therapies and an operation.

AB  - No medical on surgical treatment exists that is ideal for the patient afflicted
      Crohn's disease. During the chronic course of disease various complications or
      significant side effect of medications will develop. At this point, the patient
      is offered an operation. Indication for surgery rarely absolute in Crohn's
      disease with the exception of life threatening emergencies such as free
      perforation or massive hemorrhage. Common indications are bowel obstruction due
      to stenosis, fistula in various sites, abscess and perianal complications. It is 
      well known that future likelihood of postoperative "recurrence" of the disease,
      and to learn various operative procedures described in this article. Therefore
      surgeon should be alert to understand the pathophysiology of the disease and to
      learn various operative procedures described in this article. It is important to 
      determine proper indication and to choose best timing for operation and select
      the appropriate operative procedures.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease and predisposition to osteopenia.
PG  - 325-9
AB  - The prevalence of osteopenia in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is
      unknown. The effect of nutritional state, disease activity, and steroid therapy
      on bone mineral content (BMC) of whole body, lumbar spine, and left femoral neck 
      measured by dual energy x ray absorptiometry in 32 children with IBD was assessed
      by comparison with 58 healthy local school children. Using the control data, a
      predicted BMC was calculated taking into account bone area, age, height, weight, 
      and pubertal stage. The measured BMC in children with IBD was expressed as a
      percentage of this predicted value (% BMC). Mean (SD) % BMC was significantly
      reduced for the whole body and left femoral neck in the children with IBD (97.0
      (4.5)% and 93.1 (12.0)% respectively, p < 0.05). Of the children with IBD, 41%
      had a % BMC less than 1 SD below the mean for the whole body and 47% at the
      femoral neck. Reduction in % BMC was associated with steroid usage but not with
      the magnitude of steroid dose, disease activity, or biochemical markers of bone
      metabolism. In conclusion, osteopenia is relatively common in childhood IBD and
      may be partly related to the previous use of steroids.

TI  - Banana flakes control diarrhea in enterally fed patients.
PG  - 72-5
AB  - Diarrhea occurs frequently in the critically ill tube-fed population and may
      result from a multitude of causes. Despite the availability of antidiarrheal
      medications, diarrhea associated with enteral feedings remains a problem for
      clinicians and for the patients affected by it. We tested the hypothesis that
      administration of banana flakes would control diarrhea in critically ill patients
      receiving enteral feedings. Thirty-one patients with diarrhea and receiving
      enteral feedings were randomized to receive either banana flakes or medical
      treatment for diarrhea. Medical treatments included the use of pharmacological
      agents according to the discretion of the patient's physician or reducing feeding
      rates. Both banana flakes and medical treatments reduced the severity of diarrhea
      in critically ill tube-fed patients. Over the course of treatment, mean diarrhea 
      scores were 21.64 +/- 7.81 for the banana flake group and 25.41 +/- 9.76 for the 
      medical group. These differences were not statistically significant. Both groups 
      achieved similar levels of nutrition support. The banana flake group had less
      diarrhea clinically, with 57% of the subjects diarrhea free on their last study
      day as opposed to 24% of the medically treated subjects. This occurred despite a 
      threefold increase in the number of patients testing positive for Clostridium
      difficile toxin in the banana flake group. We conclude that banana flakes can be 
      used as a safe, cost-effective treatment for diarrhea in critically ill tube-fed 
      patients. Banana flakes can be given concurrently with a workup for C. difficile 
      colitis, thereby expediting treatment of diarrhea.

TI  - Nutrition and ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 153-74
AB  - The role of diet in the aetiology and pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC)
      remains uncertain. Impaired utilization by colonocytes of butyrate, a product of 
      bacterial fermentation of dietary carbohydrates escaping digestion, may be
      important. Sulphur-fermenting bacteria may be involved in this impaired
      utilization. Oxidative stress probably mediates tissue injury but is probably not
      of causative importance. Patients with UC are prone to malnutrition and its
      detrimental effects. However, there is no role for total parenteral nutrition and
      bowel rest as primary therapy for UC. The maintenance of adequate nutrition is
      very important, particularly in the peri-operative patient. In the absence of
      massive bleeding, perforation, toxic megacolon or obstruction, enteral rather
      than parenteral nutrition should be the mode of choice. Nutrients may be
      beneficial as adjuvant therapy. Butyrate enemas have improved patients with
      otherwise recalcitrant distal colitis in small studies. Non-cellulose fibre
      supplements are of benefit in rats with experimental colitis. Eicosapentaenoic
      acid in fish oil has a steroid-sparing effect which, although modest, is
      important, particularly in terms of reducing the risk of osteoporosis, but it
      seems to have no role in the patient with inactive disease. gamma-Linolenic acid 
      and anti-oxidants also are showing promise. Nutrients may also modify the
      increased risk of colorectal carcinoma. Oxidative stress can damage tissue DNA
      but there are no data published at present on possible protection from oral
      anti-oxidants. Butyrate protects against experimental carcinogenesis in rats with
      experimental colitis. Folate supplementation is weakly associated with decreased 
      incidence of cancer in UC patients when assessed retrospectively. Vigilance
      should be maintained for increased micronutrient requirements and supplements
      given as appropriate. Calcium and low-dose vitamin D should be given to patients 
      on long-term steroids and folate to those on sulphasalazine.

TI  - Management of the first presentation of severe acute colitis.
PG  - 129-51
AB  - Prompt diagnosis and exclusion of infection requires a minimum of rigid
      sigmoidoscopy, rectal mucosal biopsy and stool culture. Admission to hospital is 
      mandatory for patients with features of severe disease, or who are in their first
      attack of ulcerative colitis and have bloody diarrhoea, even if the criteria for 
      severe disease are not met. Once admitted, the patient should be monitored by
      plain abdominal X-ray, full blood count, serum albumin and C reactive protein on 
      alternate days; temperature and pulse rate should be recorded four times per day.
      Treatment should be instituted as soon as the diagnosis is made with an
      intravenous corticosteroid (hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenously, four times
      daily, or equivalent). Antibiotics may be included if infection cannot be
      confidently excluded. Free diet can be allowed but attention should be given to
      nutritional, fluid and electrolyte status with intravenous replacement if
      necessary. Any evidence of colonic dilatation occurring despite maximal therapy
      should be regarded as an absolute indication for colectomy. The patient should be
      kept fully informed from an early stage about the likely natural history of the
      condition and about the possible therapeutic options including surgery.
      Cyclosporin therapy should be reserved for patients who have a poor response to
      the first 3-4 days of corticosteroid therapy, particularly those with serum C
      reactive protein > 45 mg/l and who do not yet have absolute indications for
      colectomy. Most patients who have not convincingly responded within 10 days of
      starting full medical therapy should undergo colectomy, although partial
      responders who are afebrile may reasonably continue for up to 14 days before a
      final decision. Approximately 30-40% of patients with severe colitis will need
      colectomy within the first 6 months. With optimal management, mortality should be
      zero, but better medical therapies are urgently needed to reduce the colectomy
      rate.

TI  - Long-term results after surgery for acute mesenteric ischemia.
PG  - 239-43
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute mesenteric ischemia is associated with high mortality rates,
      and little is known about the long-term prognosis of patients after initially
      successful surgical intervention. METHODS: Ninety patients were treated by
      vascular reconstruction or bowel resection, or both, between 1972 and 1993. The
      overall mortality was 66%. The outcomes and rehabilitational statuses of those 31
      patients who were discharged from the hospital were analyzed retrospectively.
      Anticoagulation consisted of vitamin K antagonists in patients with venous
      thrombosis and arterial embolism or inhibition of thrombocyte aggregation in
      patients with arterial thrombosis and nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia. RESULTS: 
      In 31 patients discharged from the hospital venous thrombosis, arterial embolism,
      arterial thrombosis, and nonocclusive disease occurred in 19, 5, 5, and 2
      patients, respectively. The 2- and 5-year survival rates were 70% and 50% and
      mainly related to cardiovascular comorbidity and malignant disease. Only one
      patient died after a recurrent attack of arterial mesenteric thrombosis. Twenty
      percent of the patients suffered from chronic short bowel syndrome after
      extensive bowel resection, but none required permanent parenteral nutrition.
      CONCLUSIONS: Under appropriate anticoagulation there is a remarkably low risk of 
      recurrent mesenteric ischemia. The impaired life expectancy of long-surviving
      patients is mainly due to cardiovascular comorbidity and malignancies.

      is considered. One of the hypotheses holds that environmental factors, especially
      those in dietary intake, can be the initiators of intestinal inflammation. In
      this connection authors examined a group of patients suffering from Crohns
      disease and ulcerative colitis. Results observed in patients with Crohns disease 
      indicate: preferred consumption of flour products, decreased intake of vegetables
      and fruit, lowered tolerance to milk and milk products, increased sugar
      consumption, increased proportion of smokers, no differences in diet regimen
      between nick and healthy subjects. (Tab. 3, Ref. 16.)

TI  - Serum basic fibroblast growth factor in pediatric Crohn's disease. Implications
      for wound healing.
PG  - 378-86
AB  - Basic fibroblast growth factor is a heparin-binding protein known to stimulate
      angiogenesis and promote wound healing in tissues. Since Crohn's disease is
      characterized in part by submucosal vascular proliferation, we sought to
      determine whether serum basic fibroblast growth factor is elevated in children
      with Crohn's disease and whether serum levels reflect disease activity. Sera were
      obtained from 64 children with Crohn's disease, 44 children with ulcerative
      colitis, 20 children with functional abdominal pain, and 29 from children with
      documented inflammatory disease evaluated in our gastroenterology program.
      Disease activity indices and clinical data were gathered prospectively for the
      inflammatory bowel disease patients. Serum basic fibroblast growth factor levels 
      were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Although the mean basic
      fibroblast growth factor level did not significantly differ between children with
      Crohn's disease and other conditions, there was a strong (r = 0.53, P < 0.001)
      correlation between basic fibroblast growth factor level and disease activity.
      The relationship of basic fibroblast growth factor with disease activity
      persisted even after adjusting for other covariates (including age, sex,
      hematocrit, albumin, and sedimentation rate) in a multivariate linear regression 
      model. There was also a statistically significant, although less strong
      correlation (r = 0.33, P = 0.03) between basic fibroblast growth factor level and
      disease activity in ulcerative colitis. While basic fibroblast growth factor is
      not a specific marker for Crohn's disease, serum levels reflect disease activity.
      Therefore, basic fibroblast growth factor release may be important in mediating
      the angiogenesis and wound healing seen in Crohn's disease.

TI  - Problems in diagnosis of IBD in children.
PG  - S8-11
AB  - Children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) present unique
      challenges to physicians and all health-care providers. The most important aspect
      is that children are not small adults. They are characterized by a highly dynamic
      state of growth and physical change as well as a constant alteration in
      psychological status. It will not be difficult to recognize IBD, even in
      children, when it presents with classical symptoms such as bloody diarrhoea,
      abdominal pain and weight loss. However, some children will present with
      abdominal pain and depression. Not infrequently these children are diagnosed as
      being depressed and are seen and treated by psychologists and psychiatrists for
      different periods of time. In addition, several children will be initially
      diagnosed as having a bacterial gastroenteritis with a proven positive faecal
      culture. It seems to be the triggering event in these children, and if adequate
      therapy fails, colonoscopy is indicated. Recently, Beattie et al. showed that in 
      children seen for chronic abdominal pain simple routine blood tests including
      full blood count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are almost always abnormal in
      children with IBD. But most importantly, growth retardation is common in children
      with IBD and is more often found in Crohn's disease (CD) than in ulcerative
      colitis (UC). Faltering growth is a sign of a catabolic situation. Therefore, it 
      is essential to follow the growth of children at the beginning and during
      treatment of IBD. Growth retardation can be the first symptom of IBD and is often
      already present before other symptoms of IBD become apparent. Rarely,
      extra-intestinal manifestations, particularly arthritis, can be the first and
      sometimes only initial symptom for months to years in children with IBD. About 2%
      of all patients with IBD present before the age of 10 years, but 30% present
      between the age of 10 and 19 years. A significant proportion of young patients
      with IBD will develop the disease just prior to or during puberty. Adolescent
      growth is characterized by rapid accumulation of lean body mass and any
      inflammatory disease occurring at this time is likely to have a major impact on
      nutritional status and growth. This rapid growth requires an appropriate increase
      in nutritional substrates and failure to achieve catch-up growth may ultimately
      lead to poor cumulative growth over time. Most of the growth retardation is seen 
      in children with CD, approximately 30%. However, also in UC 15% will show a
      reduction in growth. The higher percentage in CD could be due to the disease
      itself or to the relative subtlety of the intestinal manifestations of CD, mainly
      abdominal pain and general malaise. Not only growth, but also delayed puberty, is
      a sign of an ongoing disease that most likely needs more intensive treatment. It 
      has been shown that the severity of disease activity plays a more important role 
      in the occurrence of growth retardation than steroid treatment. Therefore in
      paediatrics it is important to state that growth retardation during medical
      treatment equals undertreatment. In contrast to adults, the potential benefit of 
      nutritional therapy should be seriously considered in addition to aggressive
      medical therapy including steroids and other immunosuppressive agents such as
      azathioprine. The most convincing evidence that malnutrition is primarily
      responsible for growth failure is based on depletion studies. The malnutrition
      itself is caused by ongoing inflammation and loss of appetite. Recommendations
      for nutritional therapy include an increase in energy and protein intake to 150% 
      of recommended daily allowances for height and age. Some studies have shown the
      benefit of nocturnal nasogastric infusion as supplements of daily intake.
      Importantly, nutritional support has been shown to be as effective as steroids in
      achieving remission of disease in children. Furthermore, no significant
      differences have been shown in studies using elemental versus polymeric diets.

PG  - 71-3
AB  - We reported here a case of unexplained chronic pancreatitis diagnosed 4 years
      before the onset of ulcerative colitis. The diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis was
      confirmed by recurrent pancreatitis and irregularities of the main pancreatic
      duct on retrograde pancreatography. None of the classical etiologies for chronic 
      pancreatitis was found. Chronic pancreatitis associated with ulcerative colitis
      has already been reported in 5 cases. Our case reinforces the hypothesis of a non
      fortuitous association between both diseases.

TI  - [Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy complicating a prolonged corticotherapy for
      hemorrhagic rectocolitis].
PG  - 48-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: The cardiac side-effects of corticosteroid therapy are very uncommon.
      CASE REPORT: A girl with ulcerative colitis developed at the age of 8 years an
      acute digestive episode despite prednisolone and total parenteral nutrition. The 
      patient was then given intravenous methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg/d). Polypnea
      appeared 25 days later while blood pressure remained normal. Echocardiography
      revealed a cardiac hypertrophy associated with a systolic anterior motion of the 
      mitral valve. Cardiac symptoms and echography findings returned to normal after
      reduction of corticosteroid therapy and its administration via the oral route.
      CONCLUSION: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy has been described in preterms treated
      with dexamethasone for bronchopulmonary dysplasia. It is exceptional in older
      children under corticosteroid therapy and its mechanism remains unknown.

TI  - Inulin and oligofructose do not influence the absorption of cholesterol, or the
      excretion of cholesterol, Ca, Mg, Zn, Fe, or bile acids but increases energy
      excretion in ileostomy subjects.
PG  - 1-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of inulin and oligofructose on cholesterol 
      absorption and excretion of cholesterol, bile acids, energy, nitrogen and
      minerals in man. DESIGN: Double-blind cross-over study. SETTING: Metabolic
      kitchen with policlinic visits, Sahlgrenska Hospital, Goteborg, Sweden. SUBJECTS:
      Patients with conventional ileostomy because of ulcerative colitis.
      INTERVENTIONS: 7 g of inulin, 17 g of oligofructose and 7 g of sucrose were added
      to a controlled diet during three experimental periods of three days each.
      Ileostomy effluents were collected and analysed. Differences between experimental
      and control diet were investigated with the Wilcoxon's sign and values test.
      RESULTS: Inulin and oligofructose were recovered in the ileostomy effluent to 88%
      (95% CI, 76-100%) and 89% (64-114%) respectively. Dry solid excretion increased
      by 14.4 g (11.3-17.5) on inulin, and by 14.7 g (13.0-16.4 g) on oligofructose and
      energy excretion increased 245 kJ (190-307 kJ) on inulin and 230 kJ (214-315 kJ) 
      on oligofructose compared to control diet (P < 0.05). Cholesterol absorption,
      excretion of cholesterol, bile acids, nitrogen, fat, calcium, magnesium, zinc and
      iron were not affected by inulin and oligofructose. CONCLUSIONS: Inulin and
      oligofructose are not digested in the small intestine. They do not affect mineral
      excretion and hence hardly mineral absorption. They do not increase fat or
      nitrogen excretion from the small intestine. Any physiological effect of inulin
      and oligofructose is probably mediated through other mechanisms than altered
      excretion from the small intestine.
