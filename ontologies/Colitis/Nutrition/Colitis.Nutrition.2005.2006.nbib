TI  - An initial report of sleep disturbance in inactive inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 409-16
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is an increased prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms, peptic
      ulcer disease, and colon cancer in night-shiftworkers, whose sleep is commonly
      disrupted. Sleep complaints are an extrapyramidal symptom of irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). Sleep disruption may contribute to increased medical morbidity by
      weakening the ability of the immune system to protect against endotoxins-this
      pathway could be of potential importance to the pathogenesis and/or clinical
      course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a chronic immunoinflammatory
      gastrointestinal disorder associated with marked reductions in quality of life.
      This is the first study to comprehensively examine sleep concerns in patients
      with IBD. METHODS: Sixteen patients with biopsy-proven inactive IBD (8 with Crohn
      disease and 8 with ulcerative colitis), 9 patients with IBS, and 7 healthy
      controls completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, 
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire, SF-12, and a single overnight
      polysomnogram. Polysomnography and arousals were scored according to standard
      criteria. Multivariate analyses were used to compare subjective and objective
      sleep parameters between groups and to identify associations between sleep
      complaints and quality of life. RESULTS: Patients with IBD did not seem to
      significantly differ from patients with IBS, who have established sleep
      complaints. On polysomnography, total sleep time differentiated the 3 groups
      well, with the IBS and IBD groups appearing numerically similar. Whereas IBS and 
      IBD groups were similar with respect to observed sleep parameters, IBS patients
      did report the most concerns, consistent with earlier research suggesting that
      hyperarousal and perceptual differences may contribute to symptom reporting.
      CONCLUSION: Sleep parameters greatly influenced quality of life in both groups
      and highlight the need to address sleep concerns as part of IBD management.

TI  - [Dietary characteristics of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases].
PG  - 895-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate nutritional status and dietary habits of Lithuanian
      patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and to compare with those of
      healthy controls. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case-control study was conducted in
      the Department of Gastroenterology, Kaunas University of Medicine Hospital. A
      total of 101 patients with ulcerative colitis, 44 with Crohn's disease, and 178
      healthy controls were examined with the help of standard self-report
      questionnaire about daily dietary habits. Healthy controls were evaluated in
      primary care centers during preventive examinations. Body mass index was
      calculated for all patients in a standard way. RESULTS: There was no
      statistically significant difference between patients and controls concerning
      consumption of coffee, tea, chewing gum, type of fat for meal preparation, white 
      bread, cooked potatoes and sausages, non-carbonated water. Patients with
      inflammatory bowel diseases statistically significantly less frequently consumed 
      fresh milk, cheese, fish, fried potatoes, and soda drinks. Patients with Crohn's 
      disease statistically significantly less frequently consumed fresh fruits and
      patients with ulcerative colitis--fresh vegetables as compared to controls. Body 
      mass index of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases was significantly lower
      compared to controls, and patients with Crohn's disease had significantly lower
      body mass index than ulcerative colitis patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with
      inflammatory bowel diseases have lower body mass index than healthy controls.
      Patients consume fresh milk, cheese, canned and fresh vegetables and fruits less 
      frequently; therefore, primary care physicians and patients should be provided
      with teaching and more information about nutrition issues.

TI  - Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody does not differentiate between Crohn's
      disease and intestinal tuberculosis.
PG  - 33-9
AB  - The clinical, morphological, and histological features of intestinal tuberculosis
      (IT) and Crohn's disease (CD) mimic so much, that it becomes difficult to
      differentiate between them. The sensitivity of anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae
      antibody (ASCA) IgG and ASCA IgA in CD is 60%-80%, whereas the specificity is
      almost 90%. There are no reports of study of ASCA in patients with IT, nor has it
      ever been used to differentiate CD from IT. Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC;
      n=25), CD (n=59), and IT (n=30) and 21 healthy controls were included in this
      study. The location and behavior of CD were classified according to the Modified 
      Montreal classification. Five milliliters of blood was taken from them and serum 
      was stored at -70 degrees C. ASCA antibodies (both IgG and IgA) were estimated
      using commercially available ELISA kits (AESKU Diagnostics, Germany).
      Anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody was measured by indirect
      immunofluorescence test. ASCA IgA was positive in 4.7%, 28%, 33.9%, and 43.3% and
      ASCA IgG was positive in 4.7%, 24%, 50.8%, and 46.6% of healthy controls and
      patients with UC, CD, and IT, respectively. Either ASCA IgG or ASCA IgA was
      positive in 9.5%, 40%, 61% and 66.6% of healthy controls, UC, CD, and IT,
      respectively. ANCA was positive in 0%, 32%, 10.1%, and 6.6% of healthy controls, 
      UC, CD, and IT, respectively. ASCA IgG was positive in a significantly higher
      number of patients with CD (P<0.0001) and IT (P<0.0001) in comparison to healthy 
      controls. ASCA IgA was positive in a significantly higher number of patients with
      UC (P<0.04), CD (P<0.013), and IT (P<0.006) in comparison to healthy controls. In
      comparisons between diseases, ASCA IgG was positive in significantly more
      patients with CD (P<0.001) and IT (P<0.001) in comparison to UC. There was no
      significant difference in ASCA IgA (33.9% vs. 43.3%), ASCA IgG (50.86% vs.
      46.6%), or ANCA (10.7%, 7.4%) in patients with CD and IT, respectively. There was
      no correlation between ASCA and duration, location and behavior of CD, and IT. We
      conclude that ASCA IgG and ASCA IgA do not help to differentiate between IT and
      CD.

TI  - Response to corticosteroids in severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review of 
      the literature and a meta-regression.
PG  - 103-10
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Colectomy is a potentially life-saving procedure for patients 
      with severe attacks of UC who fail medical therapy. We aimed to systematically
      review studies that reported the short-term colectomy rate in severe UC or
      reported variables that could predict treatment failure. METHODS: We conducted a 
      systematic literature search for cohort studies and controlled trials published
      between 1974-2006. RESULTS: Thirty-two studies met the inclusion criteria; 16
      reported short-term outcome and predictors of therapy failure, 13 only outcome,
      and 3 only predictors. In the pooled analysis, 581 of 1991 patients required
      colectomy (weighted mean 27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 26%-28%), and 22 died 
      (1%; 95% CI, 0.7%-1.5%). In a heterogeneity-controlled meta-regression, colectomy
      rate did not change during the last 30 years (R(2) = 0.07, P = .8). Cyclosporine 
      was used in only 100 patients, with a 51% (95% CI, 41%-60%) short-term success
      rate. A second meta-regression failed to demonstrate a dose-colectomy response of
      methylprednisolone therapy beyond 60 mg daily (R(2) < 0.01, P = .98). More than
      20 variables were identified in 19 studies to predict medical therapy failure,
      but only a few were consistently reproduced: disease extent, stool frequency,
      temperature, heart rate, C-reactive protein, albumin, and radiologic assessment. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The short-term colectomy rate in severe UC has remained stable
      during the last 30 years, despite the introduction of cyclosporine, which was not
      used frequently. We could not find any support for administering
      methylprednisolone at a higher dose than 60 mg/day. Variables that predict
      outcome of corticosteroid therapy could aid in the development of guidelines for 
      introduction of rescue therapies in severe UC.

TI  - Characteristics of inflammatory bowel disease with onset during the first year of
      life.
PG  - 603-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is recognized in young children,
      however, only rare data on onset and evolution are available in children younger 
      than 1 year. In the present clinical study, we aimed to analyze characteristics
      and clinical course of children with very early onset IBD. We were particularly
      interested in the relationship between bacterial infections and the use of
      antibiotics before the onset of IBD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The IBD database of
      Necker-Enfants-Malades-Hospital was screened for patients with IBD with disease
      onset during the first year of life and a follow-up of at least 2.5 years. Ten
      patients were identified during the period 1996-2002. RESULTS: All patients
      presented with rectal bleeding and had colonic involvement. Four patients had
      definitive diagnosis of Crohn disease; ulcerative or indeterminate colitis was
      seen in 2 and 4 children, respectively. Five of the patients had a positive
      history of neonatal or early-onset bacterial infection with use of antibiotics
      before onset of IBD, 4 patients were still breastfed and 3 just weaned when GI
      symptoms started. Seven patients had a severe onset of disease requiring bowel
      rest, parenteral nutrition and steroid medication, followed by azathioprine or
      cyclosporine medication. Surgery was necessary in 3 of 10 patients. Disease
      relapses were frequent and observed in 8 of 10 children. DISCUSSION: Very early
      onset IBD may reflect a subgroup of patients characterized by a particular
      sensitivity to modifications of the intestinal flora. Neonatal IBD was most often
      severe in presentation and evolution.

TI  - The prevalence of long bone fractures in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 597-602
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The association of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with decreased 
      bone mineral density is well recognized. In the adult population, up to 50% of
      IBD patients are reported to have osteopenia, correlating with an increase in the
      incidence of fractures as compared with controls. The aim of this study was to
      determine the prevalence of fractures in a pediatric population with IBD as
      compared with healthy sibling controls (SC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The families
      of 209 patients with IBD were sent a questionnaire asking them to compare their
      children with IBD to a healthy sibling (non-IBD). RESULTS: Surveys were returned 
      by 132 of the 209 families (63%). The sample characteristics of this sample
      closely resembled the overall clinic population for age (mean 14.3 vs 14.7
      years), gender (53% vs 59% male) and diagnosis (58.1 vs 57.8 Crohn disease).
      Completed surveys described 263 children. Of the 132 with IBD 73 (55%) had Crohn 
      disease, 52 (39%) had ulcerative colitis and 7 (6%) had indeterminate colitis.
      There were 76/132 males (age range, 4-18 years) with IBD and 64/131 males (age
      range, 1-26 years) in the sibling controls. Mean ages of the IBD sample 14.3
      +/-.3 was compared with 13.9 +/- in SC. Of the total group, 73/263 (28%) reported
      ever having a fracture, 44 (60%) were siblings (SC), and 29 (40%) had IBD. Of the
      29 children with IBD, 17 (59%) reported having a fracture after diagnosis
      including 2 who had fractures both before and after diagnosis. The total number
      of fractures reported was 96 (55 SC:41 IBD). CONCLUSION: In this survey, we found
      no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of fracture in IBD
      patients compared with their normal siblings.

TI  - Report on the vitamin D status of adult and pediatric patients with inflammatory 
      bowel disease and its significance for bone health and disease.
PG  - 1162-74
AB  - Vitamin D is a hormone responsible for calcium homeostasis and essential for bone
      mineralization throughout the lifespan. Recent studies revealed a high prevalence
      of hypovitaminosis D among healthy adults and children, especially in the
      northern hemisphere, and a link between this condition and suboptimal bone
      health. Moreover, maintenance of what are today considered optimal vitamin D
      stores has not been achieved throughout the year with currently recommended daily
      intake for vitamin D. The prevalence of hypovitaminosis D is even higher among
      adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a situation that may be caused by
      malabsorption and gastrointestinal losses through an inflamed intestine, among
      other factors. In children with IBD, existing reports of vitamin D status are
      scarce. The relationship between vitamin D status and bone health, although
      well-established in healthy adults and children, has been controversial among
      adults and children with IBD, and the reasons for this have not been investigated
      to date. Studies in animal models of colitis and in vitro human studies support a
      role of vitamin D in the regulation of the immune system of the gut and the
      potential of vitamin D and its derivatives as therapeutic adjuncts in the
      treatment of IBD. This role of vitamin D has not been investigated with
      translational studies to date. Currently, there are no guidelines for monitoring 
      vitamin D status, treating hypovitaminosis D, and maintaining optimal vitamin D
      stores in patients with IBD. These tasks may prove particularly difficult because
      of malabsorption and gastrointestinal losses that are associated with IBD.

TI  - Treatment of ulcerative colitis refractory to steroid therapy by oral
      microemulsion cyclosporine (Neoral).
PG  - 1131-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intravenous cyclosporine is active in 60% to 80% of patients with
      ulcerative colitis (UC) who failed to respond to intravenous corticosteroids.
      Several studies have suggested that cyclosporine in microemulsion form (Neoral)
      has some efficacy in this setting, but the optimal dose, blood level, time to
      response, and remission need to be better defined. The aim of this study was to
      evaluate the response to Neoral and its toxicity in active
      corticosteroid-refractory UC. METHODS: Between March 2002 and August 2005, 20
      courses of Neoral [initial dose, 2.3 mg/kg (range, 1.8 to 2.8 mg/kg) every 12
      hours] were prescribed in 19 consecutive patients for a UC attack that did not
      respond to intravenous methylprednisolone. All patients received prophylaxis
      against Pneumocystis carinii. RESULTS: Response was obtained in 17 of 20 attacks 
      (85%) after 3.5 days (range, 1 to 7). Remission was obtained in 15 of 20 attacks 
      (75%) after 13 days (range, 2 to 30 days). Four responders relapsed and underwent
      colectomy 21 to 900 days after the start of Neoral. Overall, 14 of 19 patients
      (74%) were colectomy free after a median follow-up of 8 months (range, 1 to 41
      months). Cyclosporine blood levels were measured at fasting (C0) and 2 hours
      after Neoral administration (C2) in a subgroup of 10 responders. The results were
      103 ng/mL (range, 32 to 240 ng/mL) for C0 and 761 ng/mL (183 to 1390 ng/mL) for
      C2. One severe bedridden patient with neonatal encephalopathy died. Main side
      effects observed were mild transient renal impairment (n = 2), hypertension (n = 
      1), cytomegalovirus infection (n = 2), and esophageal candidiasis (n = 1).
      CONCLUSIONS: In active corticosteroid-refractory UC, Neoral seems to have the
      same efficacy and toxicity as the intravenous form. Trough target cyclosporine
      blood levels should not exceed 100 ng/mL for C0 and 700 ng/mL for C2.

TI  - [Toxic megacolon--surgical point of view].
PG  - 1727-30
AB  - Toxic megacolon is an infrequent, but potentially fatal complication of a
      fulminant colitis. Toxic colonic dilatation, also caused by ischaemic or
      infectious inflammation like pseudomembranous colitis, mostly occur in patients
      with inflammatory bowel disease. Toxic mega-colon is defined as segmental or
      total colonic distension of >6 cm with the presence of clinical signs of acute
      colitis and systemic toxicity. Because of the associated high morbidity and
      mortality the early diagnosis and the management play an important role. The free
      perforation means a fourfold increase in the mortalitiy of the acute colitis.
      Recognition of toxic megacolon is underlaying by x-ray of the abdomen with
      colonic distension and a lack of haustral pattern. Accompanying distension of the
      small bowel can predict the development of the disease. CT scanning shows a
      diffuse wall thickening, pericolic inflammation and abnormal haustral pattern and
      can also detect subclinical perforation or abscesses. The management of toxic
      megacolon should be with intravenous parenteral nutrition, adaequate
      supplementation of intravenous fluids and correction of electrolytes
      abnormalities and the therapy of colitis with corticosteroids. Antibiotics are
      indicated in infectious disease or bacteriemia and also in colonic perforation.
      Surgical intervention is indicated by the onset of signs of progression of the
      disease and complications as perforation, uncontrollable bleeding or distension. 
      The surgical procedure of choice is colectomy and ileostomy. The mortality and
      morbidity was decreased by avoiding rectal excision. The rectum is closed as a
      Hartmann's procedure or a mucous fistula is created. A secondary ileoanal pouch
      can be created at a later date. The interdisciplinary approach with optimal
      timing of surgical intervention can decrease the morbidity and mortality of toxic
      megacolon.

TI  - Vitamin D status in children and young adults with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1950-61
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Previous studies of vitamin D status in pediatric patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease have revealed conflicting results. We sought to report
      (1) the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D
      concentration < or = 15 ng/mL) in a large population with inflammatory bowel
      disease, (2) factors predisposing to this problem, and (3) its relationship to
      bone health and serum parathyroid hormone concentration. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 
      total of 130 patients (8-22 years of age) with inflammatory bowel disease, 94
      with Crohn disease and 36 with ulcerative colitis, had serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin
      D, intact parathyroid hormone, and lumbar spine bone mineral density (using
      dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) measured at Children's Hospital Boston.
      RESULTS: The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 34.6%. Mean serum
      25-hydroxy-vitamin D concentration was similar in patients with Crohn disease and
      ulcerative colitis, 52.6% lower among patients with dark skin complexion, 33.4%
      lower during the winter months (December 22 to March 21), and 31.5% higher among 
      patients who were taking vitamin D supplements. Serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D
      concentration was positively correlated with weight and BMI z score, disease
      duration, and serum albumin concentration and negatively correlated with
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Patients with Crohn disease and upper
      gastrointestinal tract involvement were more likely to be vitamin D deficient
      than those without it. Serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin concentration was not associated 
      with lumbar spine bone mineral density z score or serum parathyroid hormone
      concentration. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent among
      pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Factors predisposing to the
      problem include having a dark-skin complexion, winter season, lack of vitamin D
      supplementation, early stage of disease, more severe disease, and upper
      gastrointestinal tract involvement in patients with Crohn disease. The long-term 
      significance of hypovitaminosis D for this population is unknown at present and
      merits additional study.

TI  - A genome-wide association study identifies IL23R as an inflammatory bowel disease
      gene.
PG  - 1461-3
AB  - The inflammatory bowel diseases Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are
      common, chronic disorders that cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, and
      gastrointestinal bleeding. To identify genetic factors that might contribute to
      these disorders, we performed a genome-wide association study. We found a highly 
      significant association between Crohn's disease and the IL23R gene on chromosome 
      1p31, which encodes a subunit of the receptor for the proinflammatory cytokine
      interleukin-23. An uncommon coding variant (rs11209026, c.1142G>A, p.Arg381Gln)
      confers strong protection against Crohn's disease, and additional noncoding IL23R
      variants are independently associated. Replication studies confirmed IL23R
      associations in independent cohorts of patients with Crohn's disease or
      ulcerative colitis. These results and previous studies on the proinflammatory
      role of IL-23 prioritize this signaling pathway as a therapeutic target in
      inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Changes in pulmonary function in patients with ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 977-82
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Information on the occurrence and frequency of pulmonary involvement 
      in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) is inconsistent. Some authors reported
      pulmonary impairment with UC by standard pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and
      documented a reduced diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) especially in 
      patients with active disease, whereas others could not detect differences in
      routine PFTs between UC patients and controls. AIM: The aim of this prospective
      study was to determine the frequency and type of pulmonary dysfunction in
      patients with UC with respect to disease activity. Furthermore, to evaluate the
      influence of smoking, nutritional status, sputum cytology and sulphasalazine
      therapy on PFT parameters. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-six patients with UC (20 
      with active disease, 6 inactive) and 16 age and sex matched healthy controls were
      investigated with respect to the following pulmonary function tests, forced vital
      capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in the 1s (FEV(1)%) and their ratio
      (FEV(1)/FVC) and forced expiratory flow 25-75% (FEF25-75%) as well as oxygen
      saturation. For UC patients, colonoscopy and biopsy were done. Disease activity
      was assessed by Truelove index for UC. Induced sputum was sampled for cytology.
      Smoking habit, body mass index (BMI) and medications were recorded. RESULTS:
      Fifteen out of 26 patients with UC (57.6%) exhibited at least one pathological
      pulmonary function test (<80% of predicted value). Small airway obstruction was
      reported in the 15 patients, restrictive dysfunction in 30.7% and obstructive
      dysfunction in 11.5%. The impairment of PFTs was significant and more pronounced 
      in patients with active disease, FVC (-14% of predicted), FEV(1) (-9% of
      predicted) and FEF25-75% (-32% of predicted), P<0.01, 0.05 and 0.01,
      respectively. There was no significant influence of smoking and medications on
      PFTs. CONCLUSIONS: UC patients show significantly decreased lung function tests
      in comparison to healthy controls. The impairment in active disease exceeded that
      during the remission. Early recognition is important, as they can be strikingly
      steroid responsive.

TI  - Current therapy of inflammatory bowel disease in children.
PG  - 279-302
AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD) are chronic intestinal
      inflammatory diseases that can present as bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and
      malnutrition. Collectively, these disorders are referred to as inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). All patients with IBD share a common pathophysiology. However,
      there are a number of developmental, psychosocial, and physiologic issues that
      are unique to the approximate, equals 20% of patients that present during
      childhood or adolescence. These include the possibility of disease-induced delays
      in linear growth or physical development, differences in drug dosing, and the
      changes in social and cognitive development that occur as children move from
      school-age years into adolescence and early adulthood. Gastroenterologists caring
      for these children must therefore develop an optimal regimen of pharmacologic
      therapies, nutritional management, psychologic support, and properly timed
      surgery (when necessary) that will maintain disease remission, minimize disease
      and drug-induced adverse effects, and optimize growth and development. This
      article reviews current approaches to the management of patients with UC and CD
      and highlights issues specific to the treatment of children with IBD. The
      principal medical therapies used to induce disease remission in patients with UC 
      are aminosalicylates (for mild disease), corticosteroids (for moderate disease), 
      and cyclosporine (ciclosporin) (for severe disease). If a patient responds to the
      induction regimen, maintenance therapies that are used to prevent disease relapse
      include aminosalicylates, mercaptopurine, and azathioprine. Colectomy with
      creation of an ileal pouch anal anastomosis (J pouch) has become the standard of 
      care for patients with severe or refractory colitis and results in an improved
      quality of life in most patients. Therefore, the risks associated with using
      increasingly potent immunosuppressant agents must be balanced in each case
      against a patient's desire to retain their colon and avoid a temporary or
      potentially permanent ileostomy. Decisions about drug therapy in the management
      of patients with CD are more complex and depend on both the location (e.g.
      gastroduodenal vs small intestinal vs colonic), as well as the behavior of the
      disease (inflammatory/mucosal vs stricturing vs perforating) in a given patient. 
      Induction therapies for CD typically include aminosalicylates and antibiotics
      (for mild mucosal disease), nutritional therapy (including elemental or polymeric
      formulas), corticosteroids (for moderate disease), and infliximab (for
      corticosteroid-resistant or fistulizing disease). Aminosalicylates,
      mercaptopurine, azathioprine, methotrexate, and infliximab can be used as
      maintenance therapies. Because surgical treatment of CD is not curative, it is
      typically reserved for those patients either with persistent symptoms and disease
      limited to a small section of the intestine (e.g. the terminal ileum and cecum)
      or for the management of complications of the disease including stricture or
      abdominal abscess. When surgery is necessary, maintenance medications
      administered postoperatively will postpone recurrence. Patients with UC and CD
      are at risk for the development of micronutrient deficiencies (including folate, 
      iron, and vitamin D deficiencies) and require close nutritional monitoring. In
      addition, patients with UC and CD involving the colon are at increased risk of
      developing colon cancer, and should be enrolled into a colonoscopy surveillance
      program after 8-10 years of disease duration.

PG  - 1907-18
AB  - Ulcerative colitis is an important disease in the paediatric population.
      Ulcerative colitis is one of the chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, and is
      medically incurable. However, the arsenal of medications has grown as knowledge
      of the pathogenesis of this disease advances. This review looks at the classical 
      treatments for children with ulcerative colitis, including the
      5-aminosalicylates, corticosteroids and imunomodulators, as well as biological
      therapy and other, newer modalities.

TI  - Medical management of left-sided ulcerative colitis and ulcerative proctitis:
      critical evaluation of therapeutic trials.
PG  - 979-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: The goal of this work was to critically evaluate the published
      studies on the treatment of ulcerative proctitis (UP) and left-sided ulcerative
      colitis (L-UC). The results of this review provided the content for the
      accompanying treatment guidelines, Clinical Guidelines for the Medical Management
      of Left-sided Ulcerative Colitis and Ulcerative Proctitis: Summary Statement.
      METHODS: All English language articles published between 1995 and September 2005 
      were identified through a comprehensive literature search using OVID and PubMed. 
      The quality of the data supporting or rejecting the use of specific therapies was
      categorized by a data quality grading scale. An "A+" grade was assigned to
      treatment supported by multiple high-quality randomized controlled trials with
      consistent results, whereas a "D" grade was given to therapy supported only by
      expert opinion. The therapeutic efficacy of a treatment was defined by its
      success in treating UP and L-UC compared with placebo. A medication was ranked as
      "excellent" if it was specifically studied for UP and L-UC and had consistently
      positive results compared with placebo or another agent. Quality and efficacy
      scores were agreed on by author consensus. RESULTS: For the acute treatment of UP
      or L-UC, the rectally administered corticosteroids and mesalazine (5-ASA), either
      alone or in combination with oral 5-ASAs, are the most effective therapy:
      evidence quality, A+; efficacy, excellent. Only rectally administered 5-ASA
      received an A+/excellent rating for maintenance of remission. Infliximab received
      an A+ grade for induction and maintenance of remission but only a "good" rating
      because the studies were performed in all UC, not specifically UP or L-UC.
      CONCLUSIONS: This critical evaluation of treatment provides a "report card" on
      medications available for the management of patients with UP and L-UC. The
      guidelines should provide a useful reference and supplement for physicians
      treating UC patients.

TI  - Clinical guidelines for the medical management of left-sided ulcerative colitis
      and ulcerative proctitis: summary statement.
PG  - 972-8
AB  - There are few published guidelines for the treatment of inflammatory bowel
      disease. Physicians choose therapy based on evidence-based data, peer and expert 
      opinion, and personal experience. This article provides treatment guidelines for 
      the induction and maintenance of ulcerative proctitis and left-sided colitis and 
      the management of disease refractory to 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) compounds
      and corticosteroids The guidelines are derived from evidence-based data and, when
      lacking, expert opinion or the authors' experience. The comprehensive review of
      the literature is presented in the accompanying article, "The Medical Management 
      of Left-Sided Ulcerative Colitis and Ulcerative Proctitis: Critical Evaluation of
      Therapeutic Trials". Rectally administered 5-ASA and corticosteroid suppositories
      are effective treatment for most ulcerative proctitis patients. Corticosteroid
      and 5-ASA enemas, which reach the splenic flexure of the colon, are recommended
      for patients with left-sided ulcerative colitis. The combination of rectally
      administered 5-ASA enemas and oral 5-ASA agents may afford better treatment of
      left-sided colitis and possibly prevent proximal extension of disease. Patients
      refractory to 5-ASAs and corticosteroids may require an immunomodulator or
      biological response modifier therapy. Those who have ongoing signs and symptoms
      of ulcerative proctitis and left-sided ulcerative colitis despite maximal medical
      therapy require a proctocolectomy.

TI  - Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt for treatment of intractable
      colonic ischemia associated with portal hypertension: a bridge to liver
      transplantation.
PG  - 1540-3
AB  - A 64-year-old man with portal hypertension secondary to hepatic nodular
      transformation was awaiting liver transplantation when he presented with severe, 
      unrelenting abdominal pain, fever, and hypotension. Computed tomographyrevealed
      pneumatosis within the cecum and ascending colon. Because of his advanced liver
      disease and the perceived high likelihood of a poor outcome after colonic
      resection, he was managed medically. He improved initially but had a lengthy
      hospital course notable for intractable intestinal ischemia and gastrointestinal 
      bleeding. Magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated patent mesenteric, portal, 
      and hepatic vessels. His blood pressure was typically 90/55 mm Hg (mean arterial 
      pressure, 65-70 mm Hg) despite intravenous fluids and blood product replacement. 
      The hypothesis developed that the patient's level of portal hypertension was
      sufficiently severe (in the face of his low mean systemic arterial pressure) to
      compromise perfusion of the colonic mucosa. Were this hypothesis correct, then
      portal decompression might enhance the blood pressure gradient across the bowel
      and improve mucosal perfusion. With this in mind, a transjugular intrahepatic
      portosystemic shunt (TIPS) was placed. There was reduction of the portal vein to 
      inferior vena cava gradient from 29 mm Hg to 9 mm Hg and his abdominal pain and
      gastrointestinal bleeding ceased. His prompt and sustained improvement following 
      TIPS shunt placement is consistent with the hypothesis that high portal pressure 
      was flow limiting, thus contributing to persisting intestinal ischemia. This case
      represents the first report of use of a TIPS shunt to address colonic ischemia
      associated with portal hypertension.

TI  - Sources and severity of self-reported food intolerance after ileal pouch-anal
      anastomosis.
PG  - 1459-62
AB  - Data on food intolerance after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis are scarce. The aim
      of this study was to identify foods causing intolerance and to determine the
      nature and severity of reported symptoms. Patients from the Dutch Crohn's and
      Ulcerative Colitis Association were mailed a survey on food intolerance; 105 (31%
      men) of 137 patients took part. They all reported intolerance to one or more
      foods. Common symptoms (scored from 0=absent to 10=severe), included diarrhea
      (mean score=5.8), fatigue (mean score=5.5), and thirst (mean score=4.6). Spicy
      foods, cabbage, and citrus fruits (or juice) were most likely to decrease stool
      consistency, increase stool frequency, or cause perianal irritation. Onions,
      cabbage, or leeks were reported by 28% of the patients to cause flatulence. The
      urge to defecate was stronger after a cooked meal (45% within (1/2) hour) than
      after sandwiches (15% within (1/2) hour). Foods reported to increase stool
      consistency were potato products, bread, and bananas. This study demonstrates
      that food intolerance is a common, albeit mild, problem after ileal pouch-anal
      anastomosis. Food and nutrition professionals should encourage patients to base
      their food choices on individual tolerance as long as no (patho-)
      physiological-based evidence to the contrary is available.

TI  - Review article: high-dose aminosalicylates to induce and maintain remissions in
      ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 37-40
AB  - Sulfasalazine was the first aminosalicylate to be used for induction and
      maintenance therapy of ulcerative colitis (UC). Initial trials demonstrated a
      dose response that was compromised by dose-related intolerance. Recognition that 
      the 5-aminosalicylic acid moiety (5-ASA, mesalazine) is the active ingredient of 
      sulfasalazine has allowed the development of sulpha-free formulations of
      mesalazine and alternative azo-bond derivatives (olsalazine, balsalazide) that
      substantially reduce the dose-related (and allergic) consequences of the
      sulfapyridine moiety of sulfasalazine. Dose-ranging studies of mesalazine
      formulations for induction of remission have demonstrated increased efficacy of
      oral mesalazine up to 4-4.8 g/day, particularly in patients with more moderate
      disease activity. Combination therapy with oral and rectal mesalazine provide
      additional efficacy for patients with both distal and extensive colitis. The
      mesalazine formulations have dose-related benefits without dose-related side
      effects. In contrast, the azo-bond formulations are compromised by secretory
      diarrhoea at doses providing greater than 2-2.4 g/day of mesalazine. There are
      less data regarding dose-related benefits of aminosalicylates to maintain
      remissions in UC greater than 1.6 g/day of mesalazine, although the absence of
      dose-related side effects allows continuation of the same inductive dose through 
      maintenance treatment without dose-related toxicity.

TI  - Challenges in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 885-913
AB  - It is estimated that of the >1 million individuals in the United States with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), approximately 100,000 are children. IBD that
      begins in childhood affects the individual at a critical period of growth and
      development. Children with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis may experience 
      complications such as growth failure, school absence, and depression. In
      addition, because children with IBD have fewer environmental confounders such as 
      smoking, children may be an excellent population to study microbial and immune
      interactions. Despite these opportunities, the discipline of pediatric IBD
      investigation is still in its infancy. In September of 2005, a group of
      investigators with expertise in pediatric IBD met in Boston (Massachusetts) to
      review the current status of childhood IBD research and to develop research
      priorities that warranted funding from the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of
      America. The group included pediatricians, internists, basic scientists, clinical
      investigators, and members of the administrative staff and board of the Crohn's
      and Colitis Foundation of America. The research needs in respective areas were
      outlined by the heads of 10 focus groups, each with expertise in their respective
      fields (genetics, psychosocial issues, epidemiology, microbiology, immunology,
      quality improvement, pharmacogenomics, nutrition, growth and skeletal health, and
      clinical trials). Before the conference, heads of the research focus groups
      developed their proposals with experts in the field. At the end of the
      conference, members of the focus groups and members of the steering committee
      rated the proposed areas of study in terms of feasibility and importance. It was 
      recommended that the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America focus its initial 
      efforts in pediatric IBD in 5 areas: the effects of inflammation on growth and
      skeletal development, the genetics of early-onset IBD, the development of quality
      improvement interventions to standardize and improve clinical care of children
      with IBD, the immunology of childhood IBD, and the diagnosis and treatment of
      psychosocial sequelae of childhood IBD. At the conclusion of the meeting,
      investigators discussed the formation of a multicenter collaborative network to
      advance clinical and basic research in the field.

TI  - Restorative proctocolectomy with an ileoanal pouch: the role of laparoscopy.
PG  - 420-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate early experience 
      with laparoscopic restorative proctocolectomy by analyzing the perioperative
      results of surgical treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seven major surgeries were
      performed in six patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and ulcerative
      colitis. All procedures were performed under laparoscopy at our third-level
      hospital from June 2003 to October 2004. RESULTS: Mean surgical time was 287.5
      +/- 80.7 min, and median blood loss was 300 +/- 249.0 cc. There were no
      conversions; return of peristalsis began at 32 +/- 12.4 h; average time to first 
      oral intake was 64.0 +/- 32.8 h, and mean duration of hospital stay was 9.3 +/-
      1.2 days. There was one case of perineal sepsis due to ileal pouch-anal
      anastomotic leakage, which was successfully treated with oral intake restriction,
      parenteral nutrition, and intra-rectal drainage. The most common postoperative
      complication was postoperative ileus. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that the
      laparoscopic approach to restorative proctocolectomy may be considerably improved
      in our center. Particular aspects for improvement include efforts to achieve
      lower operating and hospitalization times to equate our results with those
      reported by multicenter studies for laparoscopic colon cancer surgery. In our
      opinion, learning and further training opportunities should be encouraged to
      improve surgeon experience in the field of laparoscopy, preferably at centers
      specializing in restorative proctocolectomy.

TI  - Microheterogeneity of acute phase proteins in patients with ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 5191-5
AB  - AIM: To estimate the serum alpha1-antichymotrypsin (ACT), alpha1-acid
      glycoprotein (AGP) and transferrin (Tf) concentrations and to evaluate the
      microheterogeneity of these acute phase proteins in patients with ulcerative
      colitis. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 17
      healthy control subjects were studied. The patients were categorised as severe (n
      = 9), moderate (n = 10) and mild groups (n = 8) using Truelove and Witts'
      classification of ulcerative colitis. Microheterogeneity of ACT, AGP and Tf was
      analysed by crossed immunoaffinity electrophoresis (CIAE) with concanavalin A. In
      all serum samples standard electrophoresis of serum proteins was performed, iron 
      (Fe) concentration, total iron binding capacity (TIBC) and C-reactive protein
      (CRP) were also measured. RESULTS: Our patients suffering from ulcerative colitis
      had significantly higher serum ACT and AGP concentrations and lower serum
      transferrin concentration in comparison to healthy subjects. Changes in
      concentrations of acute phase proteins were dependent on the activity of the
      inflammatory process. The glycosylation patterns of transferrin were related to
      the inflammation status. We also observed the correlation between ACT and AGP
      concentrations, patterns of transferrin glycosylation and changes in standard
      protein electrophoresis or blood cell count. CONCLUSION: The glycosylation
      patterns of transferrin obtained from patients suffering from ulcerative colitis 
      are highly branched and sialylated compared with those obtained from healthy
      subjects. In contrast, the glycosylation patterns of transferrin do not differ
      according to the activity index of ulcerative colitis. The microheterogeneity
      patterns of AGP and ACT are similar in ulcerative colitis patients and healthy
      subjects.

TI  - Distinct phenotype of early childhood inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 583-6
AB  - GOALS: Our goals were to answer 2 questions: (1) Is the presentation of
      early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) similar to typical adolescent-onset 
      IBD? (2) Is there variability in familial aggregation in childhood IBD?
      BACKGROUND: The phenotype of IBD in children under 5 years of age (early-onset)
      is poorly defined. Clinical and genetic studies of IBD, however, generally assume
      the phenotype to be homogenous throughout childhood. STUDY: We analyzed data from
      413 consecutive pediatric IBD outpatients attending our center between 1995 and
      2000. Disease type, anatomic distribution, and family history were compared
      between children presenting before (early-onset) and after the age of five (5 to 
      15 y). RESULTS: Disease presentation was predominantly colonic in early-onset
      IBD, most patients presenting with ulcerative colitis (UC). Isolated colonic
      disease was most frequent in early-onset Crohn disease (colonic 76.5%, ileocolic 
      24%) compared with ileocolic disease (ileocolic 45.5%, colonic 26%, ileal 19.4%, 
      proximal 6.3%) in the older age group. First-degree family history was highest in
      early-onset UC 26% versus 11% in the older UC group. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a
      distinct phenotype of early childhood onset IBD, with a strikingly high familial 
      aggregation in UC and greater tendency to present with colonic disease. As more
      genetic heterogeneity is identified in IBD, careful definition of phenotype is
      required to identify further susceptibility genes. The early-onset form of UC
      presents an ideal group for further genetic analysis. These phenotype differences
      also suggest that treatment and outcome may vary in early-onset childhood IBD;
      prospective studies are required to confirm this.

TI  - Health-related quality of life in the first year after a diagnosis of pediatric
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 684-91
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is of
      increasing importance in the evaluation of new therapies for inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). Available data concerning HRQOL in pediatric patients are sparse
      and uniformly cross-sectional. The aim of this study was to describe HRQOL and
      influential factors in newly diagnosed pediatric patients with Crohn's disease
      and ulcerative colitis during the first 12 months after diagnosis. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Participants were drawn from a large, prospectively derived
      observational IBD registry of pediatric patients studied through 18 U.S. and
      Canadian centers. Patients who had completed a baseline IMPACT questionnaire and 
      for whom there were 12 months of follow-up data available were included. In
      addition to description of cohort, factors that were believed to influence HLQOL 
      were assessed during the course of the year from diagnosis. RESULTS: Two hundred 
      eighteen children met inclusion criteria (77% Crohn's disease, 23 % ulcerative
      colitis, mean age 12.7 +/- 1.9 years). Mean total IMPACT score at baseline was
      154, 181 at 6 months, and 191 at 1 year (possible range 0-238, with increasing
      scores representing better quality of life). Repeated measures analysis showed
      that age and disease severity significantly negatively affected the IMPACT scores
      during the course of the year. CONCLUSIONS: In this large prospective pediatric
      IBD cohort, significant improvement in HRQOL is noted during the year from
      diagnosis. Mean IMPACT scores varied significantly depending on the disease
      severity and also decreased with increasing age.

TI  - Tacrolimus-associated eosinophilic gastroenterocolitis in pediatric liver
      transplant recipients: role of potential food allergies in pathogenesis.
PG  - 730-5
AB  - Tacrolimus is a macrolide agent that is now the primary immunosuppressant used in
      prevention of graft rejection in transplant recipients. It has been found to be
      superior to cyclosporine (CSA) for rescue therapy as well as for earlier weaning 
      of steroids. Both tacrolimus and CSA share similar toxicity profiles; however,
      their gastrointestinal side effects have received little attention. We report
      three cases of eosinophilic colitis in liver transplant recipients, maintained on
      tacrolimus as immunosuppressive medication post-liver transplantation. These
      patients also had high serum immunoglobulin (Ig)E levels, eosinophilia and
      IgE-positive radioallergosorbent test for milk proteins. The colitis appeared to 
      be mediated by food allergies. Each patient had symptomatic improvement following
      reduced immunosuppression and an appropriately restricted diet. We conclude that 
      tacrolimus may play a role in the initiation of food allergies, leading to
      eosinophilic colitis. More studies are needed in a controlled setting to identify
      the prevalence of similar findings among other pediatric liver transplant
      recipients.

TI  - PPARgamma as a new therapeutic target in inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 1341-9
AB  - The peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma(PPARgamma) is a nuclear
      receptor highly expressed in the colon and playing a key role in bacterial
      induced inflammation. Regulation of colon inflammation by this receptor has been 
      well demonstrated in many experimental models of colitis but also in patients
      with ulcerative colitis, characterised by impaired expression of PPARgamma
      confined to their colon epithelial cells. Recent data showing that PPARgamma was 
      the major functional receptor mediating the common aminosalicylate activities in 
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have also reinforced the roles of this receptor
      in the control of intestinal inflammation. The aims of this review are to discuss
      the potential roles of PPARgamma in the physiopathology of IBD, as well as the
      emerging therapeutic strategies targeting this receptor.

TI  - Infliximab for hospitalized patients with severe ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 476-81
AB  - To evaluate the efficacy of infliximab in hospitalized ulcerative colitis (UC)
      patients refractory to intravenous corticosteroids. Treatment options for
      steroid-refractory UC patients are limited and include cyclosporine and
      colectomy. Although two recent studies (ACT I/II) demonstrate a benefit from
      infliximab in outpatients with moderate to severely active UC, the utility of
      infliximab in severe i.v. steroid-refractory UC is less clear. We report our
      open-label experience with infliximab in hospitalized UC patients at the
      University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. All hospitalized UC patients who had
      received infliximab were identified. Age, sex, extent of UC, duration of disease,
      concomitant medication, hospital course, and response to infliximab were
      recorded. Response to infliximab was defined as avoidance of colectomy and
      cessation of corticosteroids. There were 12 UC inpatients refractory to
      intravenous corticosteroids and subsequently treated with infliximab. Nine of the
      12 patients (75%) failed to respond to infliximab and required a colectomy;
      median time to colectomy was 3 months. Three patients (25%) did respond to
      infliximab and were able to withdraw from corticosteroids. In this open-label
      analysis, infliximab was not effective for the majority of UC patients refractory
      to intravenous corticosteroids. Whether earlier use of infliximab would prevent
      the need for hospitalization and colectomy is uncertain.

TI  - Centrifugal leukocytapheresis therapy for ulcerative colitis without concurrent
      corticosteroid administration.
PG  - 242-6
AB  - Corticosteroid administration is an important therapy for active ulcerative
      colitis. However, long-term corticosteroid use is associated with serious
      complications such as osteoporosis, diabetes, and growth retardation. The effect 
      of combination therapy corticosteroid plus leukocytapheresis has been previously 
      reported, but that of leukocytapheresis with no corticosteroid is unknown. We
      carried out a preliminary study of six patients (two men and four women) with
      active ulcerative colitis (severe in two, moderately severe in four) who did not 
      respond to 5-aminosalicylate derivatives, but refused corticosteroid use.
      Centrifugal leukocytapheresis was carried out once per week totaling four
      sessions per course. Treatment was considered effective when patients experienced
      clinical remission, which was defined as a frequency of diarrhea of four times or
      less and absence of visible blood in the stool, after one course.
      Leukocytapheresis was effective in five of six patients(83%). With cases
      stratified by severity, both severe cases and three of four moderately severe
      cases showed effectiveness. Clinical activity scores according to Lichtiger et
      al. in cases where leukocytapheresis was effective decreased from 9.8 to 6.6 at 1
      week (P < 0.0001), declining further 2.4 at the end of the course. No obvious
      complications of leukocytapheresis were noted except for a decrease in hemoglobin
      by 1 g/dL. Centrifugal leukocytapheresis without corticosteroid treatment can
      induce remission in patients with active ulcerative colitis, and might be
      particularly beneficial for patients in whom adverse effects preclude the use of 
      corticosteroids.

TI  - Nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 561-73
AB  - Nutrition has an important role in the management of inflammatory bowel disease. 
      This role includes the prevention and correction of malnutrition, the prevention 
      of osteoporosis and in children the promotion of optimal growth and development. 
      In active Crohn's disease nutritional therapy (in the form of enteral feeding) is
      an effective primary therapy for many patients. Corticosteroids, however, are
      more effective than enteral diet therapy in adults. Enteral diets should be
      considered as primary therapy in pediatric Crohn's disease, especially in
      children with poor nutritional status or growth impairment. Enteral nutrition
      does not have a proven primary therapeutic role in ulcerative colitis. There are 
      many theories that suggest that diet may be implicated in the aetiology of
      inflammatory bowel disease, however, there are, as yet, no dietary approaches
      proven to reduce the risk of developing IBD.

TI  - Malnutrition affects quality of life in gastroenterology patients.
PG  - 3380-5
AB  - AIM: To investigate the association between malnutrition and quality of life in
      patients with benign gastrointestinal disease. METHODS: Two hundred patients (104
      wellnourished and 96 malnourished) were assessed according to the Subjective
      Global Assessment, anthropometric measurements and bioelectrical impedance
      analysis. Quality of life was determined with the validated Medical Outcomes
      Study 36-item Short-Form General Health Survey (SF 36). Muscle function was
      assessed by hand grip strength and peak flow. RESULTS: Body mass index, body cell
      mass, arm muscle area and hand grip strength were significantly lower in the
      malnourished patients. Quality of life was generally lower when compared to norm 
      values. Seven out of eight quality of life scales (excluding bodily pain) were
      significantly reduced in the malnourished patients. Comparing patients with liver
      cirrhosis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), patients with IBD experienced
      significantly lower values in the perception of bodily pain,social functioning
      and mental health. Malnourished liver cirrhotics suffered reductions in more
      scales (six out of eight) than malnourished IBD patients did (four out of eight).
      CONCLUSION: Quality of life is generally low in benign gastrointestinal disease
      and is further reduced in patients who are classified as malnourished. It appears
      that liver cirrhosis patients experience a higher quality of life than IBD
      patients do, but the impact of malnutrition seems to be greater in liver
      cirrhosis than in IBD.

TI  - High-iron diet: foe or feat in ulcerative colitis and ulcerative
      colitis-associated carcinogenesis.
PG  - 391-7
AB  - Anemia associated with long-standing chronic inflammation and iron deficiency,
      and the increased risk for the development of dysplasia and carcinoma, are two of
      the most common complications in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Because
      of iron and nutrition deficiency, UC patients are encouraged to consume a
      high-protein and high-iron diet. The crucial clinical question is the effect of a
      high-iron diet on inflammation activity and inflammation-driven carcinogenesis.
      Is a high-iron diet a foe or a feat in UC and UC-associated carcinogenesis? This 
      review updates the progress and information on (1) iron nutrition and
      iron-deficiency anemia in patients with UC, (2) experimental evidence of the
      exacerbating effect of a high-iron diet on UC and its associated carcinogenesis
      and the difference between a high-iron diet and parental iron supplementation,
      (3) the clinical efficacy of, and concerns about, oral and intravenous iron
      supplements in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and iron deficiency
      anemia, and (4) the clinical implications of long-term iron supplements and
      management of UC. These experimental findings from animal models provide evidence
      to warrant further consideration and clinical studies of iron nutrition,
      inflammation activity, and cancer development.

TI  - Role of genes, the environment and their interactions in the etiology of
      inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 345-63
AB  - Few of the studied genes demonstrate association with inflammatory bowel disease 
      (IBD). Three mutations in the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 gene
      have consistently shown to be independent risk factors for Crohn's disease, but
      none of the alleles exhibited high sensitivity or specificity for IBD. Linkage
      analysis implicated several loci on various chromosomes, and epistasis has been
      demonstrated. The etiopathogenesis of IBD remains unknown, and environmental
      contribution to their pathogenesis is evident from genetic studies that
      demonstrated incomplete monozygotic twins concordandance rate for both Crohn's
      and ulcerative colitis. Smoking has shown an opposite effect on disease
      phenotype, with an adverse effect on disease course for Crohn's disease, but a
      slight beneficial effect in ulcerative colitis. The contribution of infectious
      agents to susceptibility to IBD appears to be strong. However, the role of
      nutrition on the etiology and therapy of IBD is not clear. Inconsistencies in
      environmental risk factors could be due to gene-environment interactions, making 
      it essential to study the role of genetics and environmental contribution to the 
      etiopathology of IBD. Transgenic or knockout mice, such as interleukin-10(-/-),
      T-cell receptor alpha(-/-), Galphai(2) (-/-) and N-cadherin(-/-), develop
      colitis-like inflammation similar to humans. Therefore, animal models must be
      further studied to explore mechanistic interactions.

TI  - ESPEN Guidelines on Enteral Nutrition: Gastroenterology.
PG  - 260-74
AB  - Undernutrition as well as specific nutrient deficiencies have been described in
      patients with Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and short bowel
      syndrome (SBS). The present guideline gives evidence-based recommendations for
      the indication, application and type of formula of enteral nutrition (EN) (oral
      nutritional supplements (ONS) or tube feeding (TF)) in these patients. It was
      developed in an interdisciplinary consensus-based process in accordance with
      officially accepted standards and is based on all relevant publications since
      1985. ONS and/or TF in addition to normal food is indicated in undernourished
      patients with CD or CU to improve nutritional status. In active CD EN is the
      first line therapy in children and should be used as sole therapy in adults
      mainly when treatment with corticosteroids is not feasible. No significant
      differences have been shown in the effects of free amino acid, peptide-based and 
      whole protein formulae for TF. In remission ONS is recommended only in steroid
      dependent patients in CD. In patients with SBS TF should be introduced in the
      adaptation phase and should be changed with progressing adaptation to ONS in
      addition to normal food.

TI  - Consumption of coffee is associated with reduced risk of death attributed to
      inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases in the Iowa Women's Health Study.
PG  - 1039-46
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coffee is the major source of dietary antioxidants. The association
      between coffee consumption and risk of death from diseases associated with
      inflammatory or oxidative stress has not been studied. OBJECTIVE: We studied the 
      relation of coffee drinking with total mortality and mortality attributed to
      cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other diseases with a major inflammatory
      component. DESIGN: A total of 41,836 postmenopausal women aged 55-69 y at
      baseline were followed for 15 y. After exclusions for cardiovascular disease,
      cancer, diabetes, colitis, and liver cirrhosis at baseline, 27,312 participants
      remained, resulting in 410,235 person-years of follow-up and 4265 deaths. The
      major outcome measure was disease-specific mortality. RESULTS: In the fully
      adjusted model, similar to the relation of coffee intake to total mortality, the 
      hazard ratio of death attributed to cardiovascular disease was 0.76 (95% CI:
      0.64, 0.91) for consumption of 1-3 cups/d, 0.81 (95% CI: 0.66, 0.99) for 4-5
      cups/d, and 0.87 (95% CI: 0.69, 1.09) for > or =6 cups/d. The hazard ratio for
      death from other inflammatory diseases was 0.72 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.93) for
      consumption of 1-3 cups/d, 0.67 (95% CI: 0.50, 0.90) for 4-5 cups/d, and 0.68
      (95% CI: 0.49, 0.94) for > or =6 cups/d. CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of coffee, a
      major source of dietary antioxidants, may inhibit inflammation and thereby reduce
      the risk of cardiovascular and other inflammatory diseases in postmenopausal
      women.

TI  - Clinical aspects of ulcerative colitis in mainland China.
PG  - 71-5
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative
      colitis (UC), is reported to be increasing in incidence and prevalence in
      provinces and cities in mainland China. This article specifically reviews
      clinical features, extra-intestinal manifestations, complications, diagnosis and 
      differential diagnosis, and medical treatment of UC. Compared to patients in
      Western countries, more mild to moderate and left-sided colitis cases were
      observed in a nation-wide study in China. Complications included anal fistula,
      anal abscess, anal fissure, severe bleeding, intestinal perforation, intestinal
      obstruction and colonic carcinoma. The extra-intestinal manifestations were
      arthritis/arthralgia, eye and skin disorders and oral ulcers. The high
      specificity of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody may useful for distinguishing 
      UC from infectious colitis; in addition, serum levels of anti-saccharomyces
      cerevisiae antibody may be helpful for distinguishing between UC and CD. Oral
      sulfasalazine and 5-aminosalicylic acid (ASA) remain the mainstays for the
      management of mild to moderate UC in China. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive
      agents are also widely used in severe or refractory UC.

TI  - Colonic health: fermentation and short chain fatty acids.
PG  - 235-43
AB  - Interest has been recently rekindled in short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) with the 
      emergence of prebiotics and probiotics aimed at improving colonic and systemic
      health. Dietary carbohydrates, specifically resistant starches and dietary fiber,
      are substrates for fermentation that produce SCFAs, primarily acetate,
      propionate, and butyrate, as end products. The rate and amount of SCFA production
      depends on the species and amounts of microflora present in the colon, the
      substrate source and gut transit time. SCFAs are readily absorbed. Butyrate is
      the major energy source for colonocytes. Propionate is largely taken up by the
      liver. Acetate enters the peripheral circulation to be metabolized by peripheral 
      tissues. Specific SCFA may reduce the risk of developing gastrointestinal
      disorders, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. Acetate is the principal SCFA in
      the colon, and after absorption it has been shown to increase cholesterol
      synthesis. However, propionate, a gluconeogenerator, has been shown to inhibit
      cholesterol synthesis. Therefore, substrates that can decrease the acetate:
      propionate ratio may reduce serum lipids and possibly cardiovascular disease
      risk. Butyrate has been studied for its role in nourishing the colonic mucosa and
      in the prevention of cancer of the colon, by promoting cell differentiation,
      cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis of transformed colonocytes; inhibiting the enzyme
      histone deacetylase and decreasing the transformation of primary to secondary
      bile acids as a result of colonic acidification. Therefore, a greater increase in
      SCFA production and potentially a greater delivery of SCFA, specifically
      butyrate, to the distal colon may result in a protective effect. Butyrate
      irrigation (enema) has also been suggested in the treatment of colitis. More
      human studies are now needed, especially, given the diverse nature of
      carbohydrate substrates and the SCFA patterns resulting from their fermentation. 
      Short-term and long-term human studies are particularly required on SCFAs in
      relation to markers of cancer risk. These studies will be key to the success of
      dietary recommendations to maximize colonic disease prevention.

TI  - Indeterminate colitis: a significant subgroup of pediatric IBD.
PG  - 258-62
AB  - BACKGROUND: Indeterminate colitis (IC) is a subgroup of inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) that cannot be characterized as either ulcerative colitis (UC) or
      Crohn's disease (CD). Our aims are to determine the prevalence of IC in our
      pediatric patient population and to describe its clinical presentation, natural
      history,and disease distribution. METHODS: We performed a retrospective database 
      analysis of all children diagnosed with IBD at the Johns Hopkins Children's IBD
      Center between 1996 and 2001. Patient demographics, including age, sex, and age
      at disease onset, were tallied. Disease distribution was identified on the basis 
      of a review of all endoscopic, colonoscopic, histopathological, and radiological 
      records. All of the patients were followed up clinically to determine the extent 
      of disease progression on the basis of the initial diagnosis of IC. RESULTS:
      Among 250 children registered in the database, 127 (50.8%) had a diagnosis of CD,
      49 (19.6%) had UC, and 74(29.6%) had IC. Patients with IC had a significantly
      younger mean +/- SEM age (9.53 +/- 4.8 years) at diagnosis compared with patients
      with CD (12.4 +/- 3.8 years; P < 0.001) but not compared with patients with UC
      (7.41 +/- 3.5 years). Among the patients with IC, 59 (79.7%) had a pancolitis at 
      diagnosis, and the remaining 15 had left-sided disease that progressed to a
      pancolitis within a mean of 6 years. Twenty-five patients (33.7%) with an initial
      diagnosis of IC were reclassified to either CD or UC after a median follow-up of 
      1.9 years (range 0.6-4.5 years). Forty-nine patients (66.2%) maintained their
      diagnosis of IC after a mean follow-up of 7 years (SEM 2.5 years). CONCLUSIONS:
      IC is a distinct pediatric subgroup of IBD with a prevalence that is higher than 
      that observed in adults. Children with IC have an early age of disease onset and 
      a disease that rapidly progresses to pancolitis. Longitudinal studies are needed 
      to determine the clinical implications of this pediatric IBD subgroup.

AB  - Twenty five per cent of inflammatory bowel disease presents in childhood. Growth 
      and nutrition are key issues in the management with the aim of treatment being to
      induce and then maintain disease remission with minimal side effects. Only 25% of
      Crohn's disease presents with the classic triad of abdominal pain, weight loss,
      and diarrhoea. Most children with ulcerative colitis have blood in the stool at
      presentation. Inflammatory markers are usually although not invariably raised at 
      presentation (particularly in Crohn's disease). Full investigation includes upper
      gastrointestinal endoscopy and ileocolonoscopy. Treatment requires
      multidisciplinary input as part of a clinical network led by a paediatrician with
      special expertise in the management of the condition.

TI  - Enteral feeding in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 314-8
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Treatment algorithms for inflammatory bowel disease are
      changing rapidly. Increased and earlier use of immunomodulatory drugs and
      availability of biologic agents have reduced dependence on corticosteroids and
      made mucosal healing a realistic goal. It is timely to debate the role of enteral
      nutrition in this evolving therapeutic armamentarium for Crohn's disease, and to 
      examine the mechanisms of its anti-inflammatory effects in light of current
      understanding of disease pathogenesis. RECENT FINDINGS: Clinical studies have
      suggested that response to enteral nutrition is associated with decreased mucosal
      inflammation in Crohn's disease, that isolated Crohn's colitis is less responsive
      and that exclusive enteral nutrition is required. Basic research has demonstrated
      that lipids in the intestinal lumen can alter signalling of the mucosal immune
      system by intestinal epithelial cells. Exclusive enteral nutrition is associated 
      with alteration of enteric microflora. SUMMARY: Enteral nutrition is an
      efficacious treatment of active inflammation involving the ileum; recent-onset
      disease may be particularly responsive. The significance of effects on enteric
      flora deserves further exploration in view of the importance of microbes to
      disease pathogenesis.

TI  - Altered levels of biochemical indices of bone turnover and bone-related vitamins 
      in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1007-16
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease-associated osteopenia 
      may be related to pathological rates of bone turnover; however, the literature
      shows mixed results. AIM: To compare bone biomarkers in inflammatory bowel
      disease patients (Crohn's disease: n = 68, and ulcerative colitis: n = 32,
      separately) with age- and sex-matched healthy controls. SUBJECTS: Patients and
      controls were recruited from Cork University Hospital and Cork City area,
      respectively. RESULTS: Relative to that in their respective controls, Crohn's
      disease (n = 47) and ulcerative colitis (n = 26) patients (i.e. excluding
      supplement users) had significantly (P < 0.05-0.001) higher serum
      undercarboxylated osteocalcin (by 27% and 63%, respectively) and bone-specific
      alkaline phosphatase (by 15% and 21%, respectively) and urinary Type I collagen
      cross-linked N-telopeptides concentrations (by 87% and 112%, respectively).
      Relative to that in their respective controls, Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis patients had significantly (P < 0.01) lower serum total osteocalcin (by
      20% and 42%, respectively) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (by 37% and 42%,
      respectively), while serum parathyroid hormone levels were similar. In the
      combined patient group (n = 100), undercarboxylated osteocalcin was positively
      associated with bone markers. CONCLUSIONS: Both Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis patients have altered bone turnover relative to that in healthy controls.

TI  - Synbiotic therapy: a promising new adjunctive therapy for ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 132-8
AB  - Prebiotic and probiotic therapies are new strategies being used to treat
      gastrointestinal diseases. Recent evidence suggests that the administration of
      select prebiotics and probiotics, alone or in combination (the latter called
      "synbiotic" therapy) may improve the clinical outcome of patients with ulcerative
      colitis. We report a case of a pediatric ulcerative colitis patient who showed
      increased length of remission, resolution of symptoms, and improved quality of
      life following the administration of synbiotic therapy. The literature supporting
      the use of prebiotic, probiotic, and synbiotic therapies in adult ulcerative
      colitis is also reviewed.

TI  - Diarrhoea in the critically ill.
PG  - 149-54
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to update the knowledge on
      diarrhoea, a common problem in critically ill patients. Epidemiological data will
      be discussed, with special emphasis on diarrhoea in tube-fed patients and during 
      antibiotic therapy. The possible preventive and therapeutic measures will be
      presented. RECENT FINDINGS: The need for concise definitions of diarrhoea was
      recently re-emphasized. The use of pump-driven continuous instead of intermittent
      enteral feeding is less often associated with diarrhoea. The discontinuation of
      enteral feeding during diarrhoea is not justified. Clostridium
      difficile-associated diarrhoea is frequent during antibiotic therapy with
      quinolones and cephalosporins. Formulas enriched with water-soluble fibres are
      probably effective to prevent diarrhoea, and promising data on the modulation of 
      gut microflora with probiotics and prebiotics were recently released. SUMMARY:
      Diarrhoea is common in critically ill patients, especially when sepsis and
      hypoalbuminaemia are present, and during enteral feeding and antibiotic therapy. 
      The management of diarrhoea includes generous hydration, compensation for the
      loss of electrolytes, antidiarrheal oral medications, the continuation of enteral
      feeding, and metronidazole or glycopeptides in the case of moderate to severe C. 
      difficile colitis. The place of enteral formulas enriched with water-soluble
      fibres, probiotics and prebiotics is not yet fully defined.

TI  - Prior appendectomy and the phenotype and course of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1235-42
AB  - AIM: To determine whether prior appendectomy modifies the phenotype and severity 
      of Crohn's disease. METHODS: Appendectomy status and smoking habits were
      specified by direct interview in 2838 patients consecutively seen between 1995
      and 2004. Occurrence of complications and therapeutic needs were reviewed
      retrospectively. Additionally, annual disease activity was assessed prospectively
      between 1995 and 2004 in patients who had not had ileocecal resection and of a
      matched control group. RESULTS: Compared to 1770 non-appendectomized patients,
      appendectomized patients more than 5 years before Crohn's disease diagnosis
      (n=716) were more often females, smokers, with ileal disease. Cox regression
      showed that prior appendectomy was positively related to the risk of intestinal
      stricture (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.13 to 1.36;
      P=0.02) and inversely related to the risk of perianal fistulization (adjusted
      hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.68 to 0.83; P=0.002). No
      difference was observed between the two groups regarding the therapeutic needs,
      except for an increased risk of surgery in appendectomized patients, attributable
      to the increased prevalence of ileal disease. Between 1995 and 2004, Crohn's
      disease was active during 50% of years in appendectomized patients (1318 out of
      2637 patient-years) and 51% in non-appendectomized patients (1454 out of 2841
      patient-years; NS). CONCLUSION: Prior appendectomy is associated with a more
      proximal disease and has an increased risk of stricture and a lesser risk of anal
      fistulization. However, the severity of the disease is unaffected.

TI  - Relationship between nutritional habits adopted by ulcerative colitis relevant to
      cancer development patients at clinical remission stages and molecular-genetic
      parameters.
PG  - 188-95
AB  - UC (ulcerative colitis) patients have an increased risk of developing colorectal 
      cancer compared with the normal population. The cause underlying this higher risk
      is not fully defined but includes nutritional and environmental factors
      concomitant with genetic alterations. We aimed to evaluate genetic stability in
      the colonic tissue of UC patients in clinical remission compared with the healthy
      population, and to establish a possible correlation between nutritional habits
      and these molecular assessments. UC patients (n 42) and healthy controls (n 37)
      participated in the study. All participants were histopathologically and
      medically diagnosed. Participants completed five separate 7 d dietary records,
      food-frequency questionnaires and validated 24 h recalls for nutritional
      assessment. The extent of chromosome 17 loss and the calculated chromosome index 
      was determined in colon tissue biopsies by fluorescence in situ hybridisation.
      Correlations between the molecular and nutritional assessments were performed
      using Pearson's correlation coefficients. Significant differences in the
      nutritional intake of total fat (65 (SD 15) v. 89 (SD 25) g), cholesterol (330
      (SD 168) v. 464 (SD 177) mg), dietary fibre (32 (SD 4.7) v. 9 (SD 4) g), vitamin 
      A (1009 (SD 209) v. 506 (SD 204) microg), vitamin C (308 (SD 108) v. 72 (SD 53)
      mg) and folic acid (412 (SD 89 microg) v. 187 (SD 107)) were recorded for UC
      patients compared with controls. Significant correlations were found for the
      consumption of different food groups and the chromosome index for chromosome 17. 
      The results of our study suggest that the nutritional habits adopted by UC
      patients during clinical remission may affect key cellular components of the
      colonic tissue, inducing a high degree of aneuploidy and genetic instability, and
      probably affecting the development of colon cancer.

TI  - Iron, cholesterol, and the risk of cancer in an 18-year cohort.
PG  - 505-9
AB  - The iron catalyzed oxidation of serum lipids is hypothesized to generate
      oxidative stress, which appears to play an important role in the pathogenesis of 
      many cancers. Previous research has obtained conflicting results regarding the
      independent contribution of cholesterol and iron on cancer risk. The purpose of
      this study was to test for an interaction between iron and cholesterol on cancer 
      risk. The present cohort study was an analysis of the National Health and
      Nutrition Examination Survey I (NHANES I) database linked with the NHANES I
      Epidemiologic Follow-up Study. Baseline serum iron and total cholesterol values
      were obtained on 7,448 adults, who were followed for the development of cancer
      over 18-21 years. Population weights were applied to create Cox proportional
      hazard models of time to the development of cancer for the entire U.S. adult
      population (n=72,602,523). Control variables included: age, race, gender,
      smoking, body mass index, chronic cough, chronic hepatitis, chronic/recurrent
      colitis or enteritis, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Independent elevations of
      either iron or total cholesterol were not significantly related to the
      development of cancer in the adjusted model. However, the combination of iron and
      total cholesterol above the 75th percentile was associated with a significant
      increase in the risk of all cancers (HR 1.39, 95% CI 1.00-1.94). Iron and
      cholesterol above the 80th and 85th percentiles increased the hazard ratio for
      cancer further to 1.51 (CI 1.10-2.08) and 1.61 (CI 1.07-2.43), respectively.
      These results support the theory that the iron induced oxidation of serum lipids 
      is important in the pathogenesis of cancer.

TI  - What is the impact of resistance to activated protein C (Leiden mutation to
      factor V) in inflammatory bowel disease?
PG  - 705-10
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Resistance to activated protein C (APCR) caused by the
      Leiden mutation to factor V is the most common cause of inherited thrombosis.
      Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are considered to have an
      increased risk of thromboembolic complications, and the role of APCR as a cause
      has previously been investigated. In this study, we investigated if APCR was
      associated with non-thrombotic morbidities in IBD. PATIENTS/METHODS: Of 951
      patients asked to participate, 389 agreed by returning a signed informed consent 
      and filled questionnaire and took the blood test for APCR. Self-reported
      IBD-related surgery was used as a rough indicator for increased morbidity.
      RESULTS: APCR was present in 6.6% of patients with Crohn's disease (CD; 10/152)
      and in 12.7% of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients (30/237). The difference of 6.1%
      is significant (p=0.039). Among patients with CD and APCR, 9 out of 10 had had
      surgery, significantly more than among those without APCR (81/142). In patients
      with UC and APCR, 10 out of 30 had had surgery, still significantly more than in 
      those without APCR (36/207). For the whole group of IBD patients, APCR is
      associated with a significantly increased risk for thrombosis (p=0.0018), and for
      the UC group (8/28) p=0.0029, but not for the CD patients alone (2/9), p=0.2323. 
      No other significant differences could be shown for parameters normally related
      to increased morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: APCR in IBD was associated with an increased
      frequency of IBD-related surgery, which may warrant screening for APCR in
      therapy-resistant IBD. In patients with APCR, it may be more difficult and/or
      important to control inflammation.

TI  - Epidemiology, risk factors and outcome of nosocomial infections in a Respiratory 
      Intensive Care Unit in North India.
PG  - 98-105
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the epidemiology, risk factors and outcome of infections 
      in a Respiratory Intensive Care Unit (RICU) of a tertiary care institute in
      northern India. METHODOLOGY: Prospective, observational clinical study. RESULTS: 
      The study included 201 patients (1285 patient days) admitted to RICU over a
      period of one-and-a-half years. A total of 77 infections were identified in 67
      patients (33.5%). The infections included pneumonia (23%), sepsis of unknown
      origin (10.5%), bacteremia (7.5%), urinary tract infections (1.5%), catheter
      related blood stream infections (1%) and Clostridium difficile colitis (1%). The 
      most commonly identified organisms were the Acinetobacter species (34.8%),
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa (23.9%) and Escherichia coli (15.2%). The median length of
      stay in patients with and without infection was 13 days (interquartile range,
      IQR, 28) and 4 days (interquartile range, IQR, 3), respectively (p<0.0001).
      Multivariate analysis showed the following risk factors for ICU-acquired
      infection: the admitting diagnosis of infection (odds ratio [OR] 3.3; 95%
      confidence intervals [CI] 1.06-10.1), length of stay in the RICU (OR, 1.2; 95%
      confidence intervals [CI] 1.1-1.33); renal failure (OR, 4.7; 95% CI, 1.52-14.41) 
      and institution of parenteral nutrition (OR, 16.9; 95% CI, 1.07-269.03).
      Multivariate analysis showed the following risk factors for death in ICU: APACHE 
      II scores (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.11), and endotracheal intubation (OR, 5.07;
      95% CI, 1.24-20.65). CONCLUSIONS: This study clearly documents a high prevalence 
      rate of infections in the ICU, and the data suggest that occurrence of infections
      was associated with a prolonged ICU stay but had no significant effect on the
      final outcome.

TI  - Cow milk is not responsible for most gastrointestinal immune-like
      syndromes--evidence from a population-based study.
PG  - 1327-35
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal hypersensitivity to cow milk (CM) may be more common
      among school-aged children and young adults than previously thought. OBJECTIVE:
      The objective was to study various gastrointestinal complaints and the
      immunologic mechanisms associated with food-related, especially CM-related,
      gastrointestinal disorders in young adults. DESIGN: Of 827 subjects aged 16-21 y 
      who completed a questionnaire on food-related gastrointestinal symptoms, 49
      symptomatic subjects agreed to a clinical examination, including an interview,
      blood tests, a lactose-maldigestion test, a blinded CM challenge and, in severely
      symptomatic subjects (n = 12), an endoscopic examination. Twenty-nine subjects
      served as controls. RESULTS: Approximately 10% of the subjects reported having
      major gastrointestinal symptoms, mainly food-related (n = 70 of 86), during the
      preceding year. Specific organic disease was found in 2 symptomatic subjects: 1
      case of celiac disease and 1 of colitis. The result of the lactose-maldigestion
      test was positive in 16 of the remaining 47 symptomatic subjects, but only 4
      carried the C/C(-13910) genotype for adult-type hypolactasia. The symptomatic
      subjects had restricted their consumption of certain foods, particularly CM.
      However, in a blinded challenge, CM-induced symptoms were rare. The symptomatic
      subjects had higher plasma soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (P = 0.007) 
      and lower granzyme A (P = 0.001) concentrations than did the control subjects.
      Duodenal biopsy samples tended to have higher intraepithelial CD3(+) cell counts 
      (P = 0.065) and a higher expression of transforming growth factor beta (P =
      0.073) and interleukin 12p35 messenger RNA (P = 0.075) than did the control
      subjects. CONCLUSIONS: In an unselected cohort of young adults, 8% reported
      food-related gastrointestinal symptoms. The finding of immunologic activity
      implied the existence of a food-related gastrointestinal syndrome but not one
      induced by CM.

      METHODS: Forty patients requiring surgery for severe intestinal complications of 
      CD were examined by IOE, and the severity of the remnant small intestine was
      determined. Patients were subclassified into either an EN group (>1,200 kcal/day)
      or a non-EN group (<1,200 kcal/day) according to the amount of daily EN intake
      after surgery. Contributions of IOE findings and EN to postoperative recurrence
      were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: IOE identified intestinal lesions in 39
      patients and active intestinal lesions in 24 patients. The cumulative rate of
      postoperative recurrence was significantly higher in patients with cobblestone
      appearance confirmed by IOE (p=0.006). However, other active intestinal lesions
      were not related to postoperative recurrence. EN reduced the cumulative rate of
      postoperative recurrence (p=0.017), especially in patients with penetrating type 
      (p=0.005), in patients who did not have colitis (p=0.051) and in patients who did
      not have active intestinal lesions confirmed by IOE (p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: EN is 
      a prophylactic that prevents the postoperative recurrence of small intestinal CD.
      Patients with the penetrating type of CD, and those who do not have active
      lesions in the small intestine according to IOE, are candidates for EN after
      surgery.

TI  - Outcome following emergency surgery for refractory severe ulcerative colitis in a
      tertiary care centre in India.
PG  - 39
AB  - BACKGROUND: Steroid-based intensive medical therapy for severe ulcerative colitis
      is successful in 60-70% of such patients. Patients with complications or those
      refractory to medical therapy require emergency colectomy for salvage. Little is 
      known about the impact of timing of surgical intervention and surgical outcomes
      of such patients undergoing emergency surgery in India where the diagnosis is
      often delayed or missed in patients who are poor, malnourished and non-compliant 
      to medical treatment. METHODS: The clinical records of all patients undergoing
      emergency surgery for severe ulcerative colitis or its complication in the
      Department of GI surgery AIIMS, New Delhi, India, between January 1985 and
      December 2003 were retrieved and data pertaining to demographic features,
      duration of intensive medical therapy, presence of complications, time from
      admission to emergency surgery, surgical procedure, in-hospital morbidity and
      mortality and follow up status extracted. RESULTS: A total of 72 patients
      underwent emergency surgery (Subtotal colectomy: 60; ileostomy alone under local 
      anaesthesia: 12). Poor nutritional status was seen in 61% of the patients.
      Twenty-one patients (29%) underwent emergency surgery for complications of severe
      ulcerative colitis such as colonic perforation (spontaneous 6, iatrogenic 4),
      massive lower gastrointestinal haemorrhage (5), toxic megacolon (4) and large
      bowel obstruction (2). The remaining patients (n = 51) underwent emergency
      surgery following failed intensive therapy; 17 underwent surgery < or = 5 days
      (Group I) and 34 were operated > 5 days (Group II) after initiation of intensive 
      therapy. In this group all the post-operative deaths (n = 8) occurred in those
      who were operated after 5 days. The difference in mortality in these two groups
      (i.e. surgical intervention < or = or > 5 days) was statistically significant
      {0/17 (Group I) vs 8/34 (Group II); p = 0.03}. Overall, 12 patients died
      (in-hospital mortality: 16.7%). The mortality was higher (10/43; 23.3%) in our
      early experience (i.e. 1985-1995) when compared to our subsequent experience
      (2/29; 6.9%) (1996-2003). A total of 48 patients (including 3 awaiting a
      restorative procedure) are alive on follow up (66.7%; 3 patients lost to follow
      up). A restorative procedure could be successfully completed in 81% of the
      survivors of the emergency procedure. CONCLUSION: To optimize the outcome, a
      combined team of physicians and surgeons should be involved in the management of 
      patients with severe ulcerative colitis with focus on nutritional support,
      correction of metabolic derangements, close clinical monitoring and timely
      assessment for the need for emergency surgery. This retrospective analysis shows 
      that improved results can be achieved with experience and by following a policy
      of early surgical intervention within 5 days, especially in patients who have
      failed intensive medical therapy.

TI  - Anthropometry at the time of diagnosis in Danish children with inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 1682-3
AB  - UNLABELLED: All patients below 15 y of age living in the eastern part of Denmark 
      with a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) during the period 1998-2000 
      were identified (n=94) and anthropometrical data at the time of diagnosis were
      evaluated. CONCLUSION: The height-for-age and the BMI-for-age, as evaluated by
      z-scores, of children with ulcerative colitis (UC) did not differ from those of
      normal Danish children, but Crohn's disease (CD) children had significantly lower
      height and BMI values, both when compared to normal children and children with
      UC. In contrast to UC, CD is frequently complicated by malnutrition and growth
      retardation at the time of diagnosis.

TI  - Superior mesenteric vein thrombosis after colectomy in a patient with Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 281-5; quiz 1 p following 285
AB  - BACKGROUND: An 18-year-old woman with a history of Crohn's disease presented in
      January 2004 with severe epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting of 4 hours'
      duration. The patient was diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease, thought to
      be consistent with ulcerative colitis, in March 2003, but had no medical history 
      up until this point. Initial treatment with mesalamine was unsuccessful and she
      subsequently presented with medically resistant fulminant colitis and required an
      urgent colectomy in June 2003. Her immediate postoperative course was uneventful 
      and she was discharged on tapering doses of prednisone. In August 2003, an
      ileoscopy revealed inflamed, mildly ulcerated mucosa, and biopsies were
      consistent with Crohn's disease. Azathioprine was added to the treatment regimen 
      and the patient tapered off prednisone. At this stage the patient continued to do
      well clinically up until presentation. INVESTIGATIONS: Small bowel series,
      abdominal CT scan, abdominal ultrasound, exploratory laparotomy. DIAGNOSIS: Acute
      mesenteric ischemia secondary to superior mesenteric vein thrombosis. MANAGEMENT:
      Resection of necrotic bowel, antibiotics and systemic anticoagulation.

TI  - Phlebosclerotic colitis with deep circumferential ulceration: three-year
      endoscopic follow-up. Report of a case.
PG  - 2347-51
AB  - We report a case of phlebosclerotic colitis with deep circumferential ulceration 
      in which the characteristic findings were observed radiologically and
      endoscopically. Previously, the patient was diagnosed with colitis of unknown
      etiology in 1999 when a colonoscopy showed small erosions, ulcers, and dark
      purple mucosa in the right colon. As a result of parenteral nutrition treatment, 
      his symptoms and ulcerations disappeared; however, the dark purple mucosa
      remained unchanged for three years on the annual endoscopic follow-up. Recurrent 
      colitis associated with circumferential ulceration was diagnosed in 2002. The
      patient was treated again with only parenteral nutrition and his symptoms
      improved after a few days; the ulceration completely disappeared within seven
      months. This case emphasizes the benefit of nonsurgical treatment for
      phlebosclerotic colitis even in cases of deep circumferential ulceration.

TI  - Innate immune receptor genetic polymorphisms in pouchitis: is CARD15 a
      susceptibility factor?
PG  - 965-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pouchitis is a frequent complication after ileal pouch-anal
      anastamosis (IPAA) for ulcerative colitis (UC). The aim of this study was to
      determine whether genetic polymorphisms in the innate immune receptors toll-like 
      receptor (TLR)4 and caspase activation and recruitment domain family member 15
      (CARD15) genes are associated with pouchitis. METHODS: From a retrospectively
      ascertained cohort of patients with UC 5 to 12 years after IPAA (n = 101),
      subjects were classified into 3 groups: no pouchitis (n = 52); 1 to 2 episodes
      per year (n = 11), and more than 2 episodes per year (n = 38). Single nucleotide 
      polymorphisms in the tlr4 gene (D299G, T399I) were determined by a real-time
      polymerase chain reaction-based fluorogenic probe technique; and card15
      polymorphisms (L1007fsinsC, R702W, G908R) were determined by pyrosequencing.
      RESULTS: Pouchitis affected 49% (49/101) of the study population. No correlation 
      between pouchitis and the presence of TLR4 polymorphisms was found. The
      percentage of patients who harbored CARD15 mutations was significantly higher in 
      patients with pouchitis than in patients without pouchitis (18% versus 8%; P <
      0.05); 24% of pouchitis patients with more than 2 episodes per year harbored
      CARD15 mutations (P < 0.01 compared with the no pouchitis group). The CARD15
      insertion mutation L1007fsinsC was present in 14% of patients with pouchitis and 
      in 0% without pouchitis (P < 0.05). All patients who carried L1007fsinsC
      developed more than 2 episodes per year. CONCLUSIONS: CARD15 polymorphisms are
      seen in greater frequency in patients with pouchitis after IPAA for UC. These
      findings, if borne out in prospective analyses, suggest that CARD15 mutations,
      particularly L1007fsinsC, may predispose to the development of pouchitis after
      IPAA for UC.

TI  - Eosinophils alter colonic epithelial barrier function: role for major basic
      protein.
PG  - G890-7
AB  - Mucosal eosinophils increase in a number of gastrointestinal diseases that are
      often associated with altered epithelial barrier function, including food
      allergic enteropathies and inflammatory bowel diseases. Although eosinophils are 
      known to secrete biologically active mediators including granule proteins, their 
      role in gastrointestinal diseases is uncertain. The aim of this study was to
      determine the impact of eosinophils on intestinal barrier function. Epithelial
      barrier function was determined in a coculture of eosinophils and T84 epithelial 
      cells and in a murine model of T helper (Th) type 2-mediated colitis. Coculture
      conditions resulted in decreased transepithelial resistance (TER) and increased
      transepithelial flux. Cell-free coculture supernatants contained a > or =5-kDa
      soluble factor that also diminished TER; these supernatants contained the
      eosinophil-granule proteins major basic protein (MBP) and eosinophil-derived
      neurotoxin (EDN). T84 barrier function decreased significantly when basolateral
      surfaces were exposed to native human MBP but not EDN. Additional studies
      identified downregulation of the tight junctional molecule occludin as at least
      one mechanism for MBP action. MBP-null mice were protected from inflammation
      associated with oxazolone colitis compared with wild-type mice. In conclusion,
      MBP decreases epithelial barrier function and in this manner contributes to the
      pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases.

TI  - Bifidogenic growth stimulator for the treatment of active ulcerative colitis: a
      pilot study.
PG  - 76-81
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Experimental studies have shown that luminal antigens are involved in
      chronic intestinal inflammatory disorders. Bifidogenic growth stimulator (BGS) is
      a prebiotic preparation produced by Propionibacterium freudenreichii isolated
      from Swiss cheese. Previously BGS was shown to act in the colon as a growth
      stimulator of Bifidobacteria. This study investigated the efficacy and safety of 
      BGS in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Twelve patients with mildly 
      to moderately active ulcerative colitis received orally 4.5 g of BGS daily for 4 
      wk in an open-label treatment protocol while the baseline anti-inflammatory
      therapy was continued. The response to treatment was evaluated clinically and
      endoscopically. Concentrations of short-chain fatty acids and the composition of 
      commensal bacteria, including Bifidobacteria, Enterobacteria and Bacteroides
      species, were studied in stool samples. RESULTS: Patients showed improvement in
      their clinical activity index scores, with a significant decrease in the score
      from 7.4 +/- 2.8 to 4.7 +/- 1.5 (mean +/- standard error of the mean, P < 0.01). 
      The endoscopic index score decreased from 4.4 +/- 1.7 to 2.8 +/- 1.8 (P < 0.05)
      with treatment. Patients showed an increase in stool butyrate concentrations
      after BGS treatment (P < 0.05). There were no significant changes in stool levels
      of bacteria as a result of BGS treatment. No side effects related to BGS were
      observed. CONCLUSIONS: Oral BGS therapy may represent a non-toxic way to treat
      ulcerative colitis. However, controlled studies are needed to demonstrate its
      efficacy in the treatment of this disorder.

TI  - Cow's milk allergy presenting Hirschsprung's disease-mimicking symptoms.
PG  - 850-2
AB  - The authors present a neonatal case of allergic colitis, which manifested the
      difficulty of spontaneous defecation and irregular narrowing of distal rectum in 
      contrast enema. Rectal suction biopsy showed positive acetylcholinesterase
      activity. These clinical, radiological and histological findings were
      indistinguishable from Hirschsprung's disease. Gastrointestinal symptoms were
      improved by the cessation of cow's milk formula. The present findings may impact 
      on the less recognizable gastrointestinal manifestation of allergic colitis.

TI  - A pilot randomised controlled trial to reduce colorectal cancer risk markers
      associated with B-vitamin deficiency, insulin resistance and colonic
      inflammation.
PG  - 639-46
AB  - Colorectal cancer risk is associated with biochemical markers for B-vitamin
      deficiency, insulin resistance and colonic inflammation, suggesting that these
      three conditions are each involved in colon carcinogenesis. We expected that
      dietary supplements of folic acid, n-3 fatty acids and calcium would reduce the
      markers and thus possibly cancer risk. We therefore randomised 98 participants,
      with previous colonic polyps or intramucosal carcinomas, to a combined treatment 
      of supplementary folic acid, fish oil and calcium carbonate, or placebos for 28
      days. Blood and faecal samples were obtained prior to and at the conclusion of
      the intervention and analysed for plasma folate, homocysteine, insulin, free
      fatty acids, triglycerides and faecal calprotectin. In addition, plasma vitamin
      B12, thiamin, glucose and C-reactive protein were assessed. Our supplemental
      strategy modestly affected some of the biomarkers associated with folate
      metabolism and insulin resistance, but had no effect on those associated with
      colonic inflammation. This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility and
      practicality of clinical trials aimed at reducing diet-related biochemical risk
      markers for colon cancer. We suggest that long-term intervention studies with
      tumour-related end points should be undertaken when the intervention agents used 
      are found effective in short-term biochemical risk marker trials.

TI  - Colonic Crohn's disease in children does not respond well to treatment with
      enteral nutrition if the ileum is not involved.
PG  - 1471-5
AB  - Data supporting a response to treatment with exclusive enteral nutrition in
      pediatric colonic Crohn's disease are few. We examined clinical and biochemical
      responses of ileal, colonic, and ileocolonic Crohn's disease and assessed the
      endoscopic and histological colonic mucosal response in the colonic and
      ileocolonic groups. We prospectively enrolled 65 children (age: 8-17 years) with 
      acute intestinal Crohn's disease (Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index
      [PCDAI] >20). After ileocolonoscopy, gastroscopy, and a barium meal and
      follow-through, they were distributed into three groups (ileal, n = 12,
      ileocolonic, n = 39; and colonic, n = 14). All patients received exclusive
      polymeric feed as treatment, with a repeat endoscopy at completion of treatment. 
      At enrollment the ileal group had significantly less severe disease (P = 0.05)
      compared to the colonic and ileocolonic groups. However, the colonic disease
      group showed the least fall in PCDAI scores at completion of treatment with
      enteral nutrition (P = 0.03), with the lowest remission rate (50%, vs 82.1% in
      the ileocolonic and 91.7% in the ileal group [chi2 test, P = 0.021]). Endoscopic 
      and histologic colonic mucosal assessment showed a post-treatment improvement in 
      the ileocolonic (P < or = 0.01) but not in the colonic disease group (P = ns).
      Children with disease in the colon respond better to enteral nutrition if the
      ileum is also involved. This may be due to different underlying inflammatory
      mechanisms. Detailed pretreatment assessment in studies of Crohn's disease
      according to disease distribution with appropriate individualized tailoring of
      treatment may be important in this regard.

TI  - Glutamine-enriched total parenteral nutrition in patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 1302-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies in animal models of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) suggest 
      that supplementation of total parenteral nutrition with glutamine (gln), a
      conditionally essential amino acid in catabolic conditions, increases gln plasma 
      concentrations, reduces intestinal damage, improves nitrogen balance and may
      improve the course of the disease. However, human data supporting this assumption
      are missing. METHODS: A total of 24 consecutive patients with an acute
      exacerbation of IBD (19 Crohn's disease; five ulcerative colitis) and scheduled
      for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) (>7 days) were randomised. Parallel to a
      standardised anti-inflammatory therapy, the patients received either a TPN with
      1.5 g/kg body weight of a standard amino acid or an isonitrogenic, isocaloric TPN
      with 1.2 g/kg body weight of a standard amino acid and 0.3 g/kg
      L-alanine-L-glutamine. Primary end points were gln plasma concentrations and
      intestinal permeability assessed by urinary lactulose and D-xylose ratio.
      RESULTS: Gln plasma levels did not differ significantly in either group
      throughout the study. Intestinal permeability did not change within 7 days either
      with or without gln supplementation (Delta-lactulose/xylose ratio: 0.01+/-0.05
      (gln+) vs 0.02+/-0.1 (gln-)). The observed changes in inflammatory and
      nutritional parameters, and also disease activity, length of TPN and hospital
      stay, were independent of glutamine substitution. Five (41%) patients in the gln+
      group and three (25%) patients in the gln- group needed surgical intervention.
      CONCLUSION: Although limited by the sample size, these results do not support the
      hypothesis that glutamine substitution has an obvious biochemical or clinical
      benefit in patients with active IBD scheduled for total parenteral nutrition.

      occasionally ciclosporine. In active Crohn's disease, corticosteroids represent
      the main treatment; budesonide must be preferred, as this steroid is better
      tolerated than prednisone. In patients refractory or intolerant to steroids,
      infliximab or artificial nutrition can be considered. Maintenance treatment is
      indicated in most of IBD patients. 5-ASA derivates are preferred in UC; in case
      of failure, azathioprine can be used. In Crohn's disease, azathioprine or
      methotrexate are more widely used; maintenance with infliximab is an option in
      case of failure. Surgery is mainly indicated for complications or in patients
      resistant to medical treatment.

PG  - 943-8
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases are chronic conditions of unknown origin that result 
      from continuous or intermittent inflammation of a part of the intestinal wall.
      The main classic types of IBD are ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and
      indeterminate colitis that cannot be classified accurately as ulcerative colitis 
      or Crohn's disease with pure colonic involvement. The two main subtypes of
      microscopic colitis, namely lymphocytic and collagenous colitis, fulfill the
      criteria that define IBD and should be considered as true IBD.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease-like colitis in a young Turkish child with glycogen
      storage disease type 1b and elevated platelet count.
PG  - 180-2
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-like colitis is a known entity in glycogen
      storage disease (GSD) type 1b patients. The mean age of the reported cases with
      IBD-like colitis was 12 +/- 5 years, and all had absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 
      less than 1,000 cells/microl. We report a three-year-old girl with GSD type 1b
      that was dignosed by mutation analysis. The patient was hospitalized with fever, 
      diarrhea, and perioral and anal ulcers. Colonoscopy was performed and IBD-like
      colitis was diagnosed. The patient had elevated platelet count beyond the age of 
      three months, but IBD-like colitis was diagnosed at three years of age. An
      elevated platelet count may be a warning sign for the IBD-like colitis in young
      patients with GSD type 1b.

TI  - Essential fatty acid depletion in children with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 573-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) suffer from
      malabsorption and malnutrition and therefore may be at risk of developing
      polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) deficiency. The aim of this study was to
      investigate PUFA status in children with IBD and the possible relationship to
      disease activity and nutritional status. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We assessed the
      fatty acid composition of plasma phospholipids (%wt/wt) of 21 children aged
      5.5-18 years with IBD (ulcerative colitis, 15; Crohn's disease, 6) with mild or
      moderate disease activity. The clinical symptoms and biochemical indices of
      disease activity and nutritional status (lean and fat body mass, Hb, albumin
      serum conc.) were also determined. RESULTS: The patients had lower phospholipid
      PUFAs than 13 healthy, aged-matched controls (25.8+/-5.2 versus 34.2+/-5.7,
      M+/-SD, p<0.001), mainly due to lower values of linoleic acid (18:2n-6,
      14.0+/-3.8 versus 18.3+/-4.3, p<0.01) and its major metabolite arachidonic acid
      (20:4n-6, 5.3+/-2.0 versus 9.3+/-1.9, p<0.0001). There were also higher values of
      a-linolenic acid (18:3n-3, 0.3+/-0.4 versus 0.2+/-0.1, p<0.01) while the
      long-chain n-3 PUFA-eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids were normal. Total
      n-6 PUFA correlated inversely to erythrocyte sedimentation rate (p<0.01),
      seromucoid (p<0.05) and positively to Hb concentration (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS:
      Children with inflammatory bowel disease have a high risk of n-6 PUFA depletion, 
      which is related to disease activity.

TI  - Place of probiotics.
PG  - 318-25
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review reports on the recent progress understanding
      mechanisms of action and clinical applications of probiotics. RECENT FINDINGS:
      New insights on regulating mechanisms of intestinal commensal bacteria to prevent
      and treat different gastrointestinal diseases have been reported. Some
      probiotics, though not all, exert beneficial effects by modulating the mucosal
      barrier function and immune activity. It seems that a combination of different
      probiotics is more effective than a single strain. It was demonstrated that not
      only viable bacteria administered to the intestinal tract but also isolated
      probiotic DNA is active, even if injected subcutaneously. There is reasonable
      evidence to recommend probiotics in infectious diarrhoea for prevention and
      treatment (mainly in children) and to prevent antibiotic-induced gastrointestinal
      side effects. Furthermore, probiotics are effective in maintaining remission in
      ulcerative colitis and preventing and treating pouchitis. Promising positive
      effects were published in major surgery patients (gastric resection, pancreatic
      resection, liver transplantation) and in severe necrotising acute pancreatitis.
      SUMMARY: Increasing knowledge on probiotics is exciting, but in the near future
      it must be defined which probiotics (single strains or a combination) are most
      effective in specific diseases. Well-designed, randomized clinical trials are
      still required to further define the role of probiotics as preventive and
      therapeutic agents.

TI  - Extraintestinal manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 147-63
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) predominantly affects the gastrointestinal
      system but it is associated with a large number of extraintestinal manifestations
      (EIM). These extraintestinal disorders can significantly contribute to morbidity 
      and impair the overall life quality. EIM may be diagnosed before, concurrently
      with, or after the diagnosis of IBD is made. The precise etiology of EIM remains 
      unknown. It currently is believed that mucosa from the underlying bowel disease
      may provide associated immune responses for the inflammatory process in the
      extraintestinal sites. The involvement of autoimmune mechanisms has been
      suggested when the shared and unique epitopes in the human colon, eye, joint and 
      biliary epithelium were detected. Recently, the presence of long-lived
      populations of memory lymphocytes has been discovered which arise as a
      consequence of bowel inflammation and express homing receptors that direct their 
      migration not only to the gut but also to the extraintestinal sites. The most
      common extraintestinal disorders associated with IBD include dermatologic,
      ophthalmologic, musculoskeletal and hepatobiliary diseases, although virtually
      every organ system may be involved. If these disorders can be considered as the
      real extraintestinal manifestations of IBD or represent just association between 
      different syndromes of autoimmune etiology, is still not clear. It is important
      to acquire knowledge on these extraintestinal manifestations of Crohn's disease
      and ulcerative colitis to start the respective treatment early.

PG  - 49-55
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the incidence and location at diagnosis of inflammatory
      bowel disease in children and adolescents in northern France between 1988 and
      1999. METHODS: A 12-year prospective population-based study was conducted by
      gastroenterologists and pediatric gastroenterologists of northern France
      (1,312,141 children <17 years of age). RESULTS: From 1988 to 1999, 509 cases of
      childhood inflammatory bowel disease were recorded (7.2% of all inflammatory
      bowel disease cases in Northern France): 367 Crohn disease, 122 ulcerative
      colitis and 20 indeterminate colitis. The mean standardized incidence was
      3.1/10(5) for inflammatory bowel disease as a whole (2.3 for Crohn disease, 0.8
      for ulcerative colitis and 0.12 for indeterminate colitis). Crohn disease
      location at diagnosis was: small bowel and colon (71%), colon only (10%) and
      small bowel only (19%). Location of initial ulcerative colitis was: proctitis
      (11%), left colitis (57%) and pancolitis (32%). Although ulcerative colitis
      incidence remained stable (0.8), Crohn disease incidence increased from 2.1 in
      1988 to 1990 to 2.6 in 1997 to 1999 (P = 0.2). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of
      Crohn disease in the children of northern France showed an increasing trend (20%;
      not significant) during the 12-year period while the incidence of ulcerative
      colitis remained stable. In the entire population(children and adults)the
      incidence of Crohn disease increased significantly (+23%; P < 0.001), while the
      incidence of ulcerative colitis decreased (-17%; P < 0.0001).

TI  - Prevalence and outcome of allergic colitis in healthy infants with rectal
      bleeding: a prospective cohort study.
PG  - 16-22
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Allergic colitis is often diagnosed clinically in healthy infants
      with rectal bleeding and often treated with costly hypoallergenic formula. The
      true prevalence of allergic colitis is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that
      allergic colitis is overdiagnosed in healthy infants with rectal bleeding. The
      authors also determined whether rectal bleeding in infants without allergic
      colitis would resolve without diet change. METHODS: For the purposes of this
      study, allergic colitis was defined histologically as colonic mucosa with >or= 6 
      eosinophils per high power field and/or eosinophils in colonic crypts or
      muscularis mucosae. We surveyed all 56 Ohio NASPGHAN members to determine
      standard practice regarding the evaluation of rectal bleeding in infants. In
      addition, infants <or= 6 months old with rectal bleeding were recruited from the 
      referral area of Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. All infants
      underwent flexible sigmoidoscopy with biopsies at 5, 10 and 15 cm. Formula or
      maternal diet was changed only for infants with histologic findings of allergic
      colitis as defined. Study subjects were followed for 9 weeks. RESULTS: In the
      survey of NASPGHAN members, 84% indicated they would empirically change the diet 
      of an infant with rectal bleeding to treat presumed allergic colitis. In our
      study population, however, only 14 of 22 (64%; 95% confidence interval, 41-83)
      infants with rectal bleeding had allergic colitis. Five (23%) had normal biopsies
      and three (14%) had nonspecific colitis. Rectal bleeding in all infants with
      normal biopsies or nonspecific colitis resolved without diet change except for 1 
      infant subsequently diagnosed with infantile inflammatory bowel disease.
      CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of infants with rectal bleeding may not have
      allergic colitis and may undergo unnecessary, expensive formula or maternal diet 
      changes that may discourage breast-feeding.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease in children and adolescents: recommendations for
      diagnosis--the Porto criteria.
PG  - 1-7
AB  - Ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease may present before the age of 20 years in
      25% to 30% of all patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Reported incidence
      figures vary considerably depending on the collection of data. Multicenter,
      multinational collaboration is needed when studying pediatric inflammatory bowel 
      disease. The essential first step is uniformity in the work-up and criteria used 
      for diagnosis. The Porto diagnostic criteria presented here provide the tool that
      is needed. These criteria are the result of consensus reached by the ESPGHAN
      inflammatory bowel disease working group. Diagnosis of Crohn disease, ulcerative 
      colitis and indeterminate colitis is based on clinical signs and symptoms,
      endoscopy and histology and radiology. Every child suspected of inflammatory
      bowel disease should undergo a complete diagnostic program consisting of
      colonoscopy with ileal intubation, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and (in all
      cases except in definite ulcerative colitis) radiologic contrast imaging of the
      small bowel. Multiple biopsies from all segments of the gastrointestinal tract
      are needed for a complete histologic evaluation. A diagnosis of indeterminate
      colitis cannot be made unless a full diagnostic program has been performed.

TI  - Primary signet-ring cell carcinoma mimicking segmental Crohn's colitis.
PG  - 537-41
AB  - Primary signet-ring cell carcinoma of the colon is a rare entity with a dismal
      prognosis, mainly due to a delay in diagnosis. Here, we present a case of a
      30-year-old Filipino woman who presented with symptoms mimicking inflammatory
      bowel disease. A barium enema and colonoscopy demonstrated a stricture in the
      rectosigmoid region. A biopsy revealed granulomatous changes indicative of
      inflammatory bowel disease. Despite initial improvement of her symptoms on total 
      parenteral nutrition and steroids, the patient relapsed several weeks later with 
      recurrent left lower quadrant pain. A subsequent biopsy revealed poorly
      differentiated signet-ring cell carcinoma of the colon. She was treated
      surgically with a left hemi-colectomy and primary repair. A high degree of
      suspicion is necessary to correctly diagnose these, often young, patients with
      primary signet-ring cell carcinoma early and have a positive impact on survival. 
      The literature on primary signet-ring cell carcinoma is reviewed.

TI  - Nutritional therapy for Crohn's disease in Japan.
PG  - 25-31
AB  - In Japan, nutritional therapy as both a primary and as a secondary treatment is
      widely used for Crohn's disease (CD). The rationale for its use is based on a
      variety of reasons. The first is its ability to induce remission and to
      ameliorate the activity of intestinal lesions in the short term by enteral (EN)
      or by parenteral nutritional therapy in which overexpressions of chemokine
      receptors in an active stage are decreased significantly in the remission stage. 
      Second is its ability to maintain remission over the long term through home-based
      enteral nutrition in which tube feeding during the nighttime is encouraged. Third
      is its ability to reduce the steroid dosage over the period of a long-term
      treatment course. However, several disadvantages of this therapy such as
      unpalatability and sluggish effect have been pointed out. Several studies have
      attempted to resolve this issue and determine the best components of EN,
      especially in fat composition. Some data have been suggestive of too much
      long-chained fatty acid having a hazardous effect on EN's clinical efficacy
      because it works as a precursor of inflammatory prostaglandins. Our recent data
      show that medium-chained triglyceride did not have such a hazardous effect on
      clinical efficacy. Several studies suggested that the patient factors that were
      resistant to inducing remission in the short term were a long period of suffering
      CD, a high activity (on Crohn's Disease Activity Index, CDAI), hemorrhagic
      colitis, and colitis with marked cobblestoning. Japanese guidelines for the
      treatment of CD recommended nutritional therapy as a first-line therapy and as a 
      maintenance therapy after inducing remission. This treatment policy has led to
      Japanese CD patients having lower mortality rates than that of patients who do
      not receive EN. If this therapy could be combined with other drug therapies,
      including strong immunosuppressants, treatment strategies would be improved over 
      those we have at present.

AB  - Guidelines for treatment of ulcerative colitis in children have been created by
      the working group of the Japanese Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology,
      Hepatology, and Nutrition and the Japanese Society for Pediatric Inflammatory
      Bowel Disease. The ideas of these guidelines, with regard to the fundamental
      differences in medical treatment between children and adults, included (1) for
      children, intensive medical treatment including appropriate systemic management
      is important during the acute phase of illness. (2) Treatment with steroids,
      which can cause growth disturbances, should not be continued for long period of
      time. (3) Pulsed steroid therapy, selective removal of blood cells, and
      intravenous infusion of cyclosporin are included in the therapeutic option for
      severe and fluminant cases.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 233-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasing in frequency in
      Australia. General practitioners play an important role in early diagnosis and in
      a multidisciplinary approach to managing such patients. Keeping abreast of
      evolving concepts, particularly in treatment, is challenging. OBJECTIVE: This
      article aims to address key issues in diagnosis and management to better equip
      general practitioners for their role in multidisciplinary management of patients 
      with IBD. DISCUSSION: Making the diagnosis can be difficult, but is facilitated
      by appropriate clinical suspicion and sensible judgment as to who undergoes
      diagnostic tests such as colonoscopy. Treatment of ulcerative colitis has changed
      little in recent years, except for our improved ability to deliver mesalazine to 
      the large bowel via the recent availability of several oral and rectal
      preparations. Prevention of relapse using these is an important strategy in the
      majority of patients. Treatment of Crohn disease is changing due to more
      realistic concepts of the natural history of the disease and the development of
      new, powerful anti-inflammatory therapies. Attention to issues other than
      intestinal inflammation such as nutrition, education and counselling, remain
      important in achieving optimal management.

TI  - Serum selenoprotein-P levels in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 574-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Selenoprotein-P is a selenium-rich serum protein that carries more
      than 50% of serum selenium. We evaluated changes in serum selenoprotein-P levels 
      in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Serum selenoprotein-P
      levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Twenty healthy
      individuals (controls), 34 patients with ulcerative colitis, and 37 patients with
      Crohn's disease (CD) were studied. RESULTS: A highly significant correlation was 
      found between the serum selenium and selenoprotein-P levels. There was no
      significant difference in serum selenoprotein-P levels between healthy controls
      (average 3.4+/-0.8 microg/mL, n=20) and patients with ulcerative colitis
      (3.0+/-1.0 microg/mL, n=34). Serum selenoprotein-P levels were significantly
      lower in patients with CD (average 1.8+/-0.5 microg/mL, n=37). Serum
      selenoprotein-P levels were significantly lower in the elemental diet group of
      patients who had CD (average 1.4+/-0.4 microg/mL, n=17) than in the non-elemental
      diet group of patients who had CD (average 2.1+/-0.3 microg/mL, n=20).
      CONCLUSION: We found that the serum selenoprotein-P level is decreased in
      patients with CD. It may be a useful marker to monitor the systemic selenium
      status in various disorders.

TI  - Patient education in inflammatory bowel disease does not influence patients
      knowledge and long-term psychosocial well-being.
PG  - 367-71
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Patient education is accepted in many disciplines as a valid
      component of disease management in chronic diseases. The aim of this prospective 
      study was to analyze the effects of an education program in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: 145 patients with inflammatory bowel disease
      were prospectively included: 73 were educated in four sessions, 72 were educated 
      after the one year evaluation period (control group). The following topics were
      presented: pathogenesis, diagnostic procedures, course of disease, medical and
      surgical treatment, nutrition, social problems and support, stress management,
      and coping with the disease. RESULTS: The repeated measurement two-way analysis
      of variances showed no effects of the patient education program on
      disease-related knowledge, depression and quality of life. CONCLUSION: This
      patient education program was not able to increase disease-related knowledge or
      psychosocial variables in patients with IBD. However, most of the patients were
      very satisfied with the education program, since as judged by their own
      assessment it helped them to act responsibly for themselves and their disease.

TI  - Metallothionein overexpression does not protect against inflammatory bowel
      disease in a murine colitis model.
PG  - BR69-73
AB  - BACKGROUND: We evaluated whether modulation of metallothionein (MT, and
      subsequent oxidative stress) would influence the development and progression of
      colitis. MATERIAL/METHODS: MT-transgenic (MT-TG), MT-knockout (MT-KO), and
      wild-type (WT) mice were treated with Dextran Sodium Sulfate (DSS) to induce
      colitis compared to controls (no DSS). RESULTS: The DSS treated MT-TG and MT-KO
      mice responded in a manner similar to that of DSS treated WT mice, with all
      groups developing severe colitis. The colonic MT content in DSS treated animals
      increased drastically when compared to controls. The colonic and blood levels of 
      the antioxidant, glutathione (GSH), were significantly reduced in DSS treated
      MT-TG and MT-KO mice. Howevei there was no significant difference in the cysteine
      levels in these mice. The subeellular level of MT was highest in intestinal
      crypts loci of MT-TG mice and was not observed in MT-KO mice as well as in the
      inflammatory lesions. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that MT does not appear to
      influence the development or progression of intestinal pathology in the DSS
      animal model of IBD.

TI  - Infliximab efficacy in pediatric ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 213-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effects of infliximab, a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) 
      antibody, have been well established in adult patients with inflammatory and
      fistulizing Crohn's disease. This study evaluates short- and long-term efficacy
      of infliximab in children with ulcerative colitis. METHODS: All pediatric
      patients with ulcerative colitis who received infliximab between July 2001 and
      November 2003 at the Johns Hopkins Children's Center were identified. Short- and 
      long-term outcomes and adverse reactions were evaluated. RESULTS: Twelve
      pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis received infliximab for treatment of
      fulminant colitis (3 patients), acute exacerbation of colitis (3),
      steroid-dependent colitis (5), and steroid-refractory colitis (1). Nine patients 
      had a complete short-term response, and 3 had partial improvement. The mean per
      patient dose of corticosteroid after the first infliximab infusion decreased from
      45 mg/day at the first infusion to 22.2 mg/day at 4 weeks (P = 0.02) and 7.8
      mg/day at 8 weeks (P = 0.008). Eight patients were classified as long-term
      responders with a median follow-up time of 10.4 months. Of the 4 long-term
      nonresponders, 3 underwent colectomy, and the fourth has ongoing chronic
      symptoms. Three of 4 long-term nonresponders were steroid-refractory compared
      with 1 of 8 long-term responders. Patients receiving 6-mercaptopurine had a
      better response to infliximab. CONCLUSION: Infliximab should be considered in the
      treatment of children with symptoms of acute moderate to severe ulcerative
      colitis.

TI  - Urgent subtotal colectomy for severe inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 70-3
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the safety of subtotal colectomy
      and outcomes after this procedure in the modern era of immunosuppressive agents
      and primary pelvic pouch surgery. METHODS: All patients undergoing subtotal
      colectomy with ileostomy for ulcerative colitis or Crohn's colitis from July 1,
      1990 to June 30, 2003 were identified from a prospective database. Only patients 
      who were operated on while hospitalized for disease exacerbation were included in
      the analysis. Age at colectomy, preoperative days in the hospital, postoperative 
      length of stay, and complications were recorded. The medical records were then
      reviewed for duration of disease, preoperative diagnosis, use of steroids and
      immunomodulators, parenteral nutrition, endoscopy findings, albumin level,
      postoperative diagnosis, and ultimate disposition. RESULTS: One hundred one
      patients underwent subtotal colectomy for inflammatory bowel disease during the
      study period. Seventy-four patients met all the inclusion criteria. The mean age 
      was 35.9 (range, 18-86) years. Median duration of disease was 36 (0-240) months, 
      but 28 patients had colitis for less than 1 year, whereas 10 patients had disease
      of greater than 10 years duration at the time of colectomy. Median preoperative
      hospital stay was 7 (range, 0-43) days and median postoperative length of stay
      was 6.5 (range, 4-37) days. Sixty-six patients underwent surgery for refractory
      exacerbation, 5 for free perforation, 2 for abscess, and 1 patient for
      hemorrhage. Twenty-seven patients (36.5 percent) had a change in diagnosis after 
      surgery. Complications occurred in 17 patients (23 percent), including 8 cases of
      central venous catheter-associated thrombosis; 7 of these occurred in patients
      who had been hospitalized for more than a week before surgery. In the ulcerative 
      colitis patients, 31 of 52 ultimately underwent ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, but
      20 (39 percent) chose either completion proctectomy or no further surgery.
      CONCLUSIONS: Subtotal colectomy with ileostomy remains a safe and effective
      treatment for patients requiring urgent surgery for severe inflammatory bowel
      disease. Because of the substantial incidence of change in diagnosis and
      satisfaction in many patients with an ileostomy, subtotal colectomy with
      ileostomy may be preferable to primary ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, even when a 
      pouch is considered safe.

TI  - A double-blind dose-escalating trial comparing novel mesalazine pellets with
      mesalazine tablets in active ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 133-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mesalazine as the treatment standard for ulcerative colitis can be
      applied in different galenical preparations. AIM: A novel formulation of
      mesalazine pellets with delayed and prolonged release characteristics was
      compared with conventional Eudragit L-coated tablets. Furthermore, the effect of 
      mesalazine dose escalation on nonresponders was evaluated in both treatment
      groups. METHODS: A total of 233 patients with mild to moderately active
      ulcerative colitis were randomized to receive either mesalazine (1.5 g/day in
      three doses) as pellets (n = 115) or tablets (n = 118) for 8 weeks. At
      insufficient response, the dose was increased to 3.0 g. RESULTS: The clinical
      remission rate (clinical activity index < or = 4) for pellets was 67% vs. 68% for
      tablets which statistically proved to be not inferior (significance level alpha =
      2.5%). In patients without dose increase, the remission rate was 47% (pellets)
      vs. 42% (tablets). Endoscopic improvement was observed in 80% (pellets) vs. 83%
      (tablets), and histological improvement in 48% (pellets) vs. 52% (tablets) of
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: Mesalazine pellets are as effective as tablets in the
      treatment of mild to moderately active ulcerative colitis. Dose escalation to 3.0
      g/day is a valid option for nonresponders to a starting dose of 1.5 g/day.

TI  - Health-related quality of life improves in children and adolescents with
      inflammatory bowel disease after attending a camp sponsored by the Crohn's and
      Colitis Foundation of America.
PG  - 164-70
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in
      children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) after attending an
      IBD summer camp. METHODS: A prospective analysis of quality of life was completed
      at an overnight camp that was exclusively for patients with IBD, which was
      sponsored by the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America. The IMPACT-II
      questionnaire (Canada and United States) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory
      for Children were administered to the campers at the beginning and at the end of 
      a 1-week camp to assess HRQOL and anxiety. The IMPACT-II questionnaire consists
      of 35 questions measuring 6 quality-of-life domains (i.e., bowel domain, systemic
      symptoms, emotional functioning, social functioning, body image, and
      treatment/interventions). The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children consists
      of 2 different 20-item sets of questions. One set assesses state anxiety, and the
      other, trait anxiety. A repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance was
      performed to determine the differences between scores attained before and after
      camp on the IMPACT-II questionnaire and in each of its domains. Paired sample t
      tests were performed on state and trait anxiety before and after camp. RESULTS: A
      total of 125 individuals consented to participate, but 61 patients (50 girls and 
      11 boys; age range, 9 to 16 y) completed the IMPACT-II questionnaire in full. Of 
      those 61 patients, 47 had Crohn's disease and 14 had ulcerative colitis. There
      was statistically significant improvement between the mean (+/-SD) precamp total 
      score (172.95 +/- 36.61) and the mean postcamp total score (178.71 +/- 40.97; P =
      0.035), bowel symptoms scores (P = 0.036), social functioning scores (P = 0.022),
      and treatment interventions scores (P = 0.012). No difference was found between
      anxiety scores before and after camp on either the state or trait anxiety
      inventories (n = 55; P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, HRQOL improved in children 
      after attending IBD summer camp. This exploratory study suggests that
      contributing factors for these improvements may be an increase in social
      functioning, a better acceptance of IBD symptoms, and less distress regarding
      treatment interventions, suggesting that a camp that is specifically designed for
      children with IBD may normalize the chronic illness experience. However, future
      research using a multimodal measurement approach is warranted to support these
      conclusions.

TI  - Cigarette smoking and age at diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 42-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The incidence and age of onset of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      appear to be changing. The aim of this study was to determine whether the
      prevalence of cigarette smoking differs among patients with Crohn's disease (CD) 
      or ulcerative colitis (UC) at the time of diagnosis compared with the general
      population and whether smoking history is related to the type and age of IBD
      onset. METHODS: Prevalence rates of smoking at the time of IBD diagnosis were
      compared between patients with CD and UC from the IBD Center at the University of
      Pittsburgh Medical Center versus age-, gender-, and time period-adjusted rates in
      the Pennsylvania general population. Analyses also were stratified by gender and 
      diagnoses before and after 40 years of age, i.e., early and late onset. RESULTS: 
      There were 263 IBD patients (144 UC patients and 119 CD patients) seen in the IBD
      center between August 2000 and December 2002. The prevalence of active smoking
      was significantly higher at diagnosis in CD patients compared with the
      Pennsylvania general population (33% versus 24%, P = 0.04), particularly in those
      with CD onset at 40 years of age or later (47% versus 27%, P = 0.005). In
      contrast, smoking prevalence was significantly lower in UC patients than the
      general population (9% versus 28%, P < 0.0001), particularly among those with UC 
      onset before the age of 40 years (6% versus 27%, P < 0.0001). Smoking cessation
      was associated with an approximate, but nonsignificant, 3-fold higher likelihood 
      of late-onset UC compared with CD. CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette smoking is associated
      with the development of late-onset CD and is protective against developing UC at 
      any age, particularly early onset. Former smoking is associated with a high
      likelihood of developing late-onset UC, but not CD.
