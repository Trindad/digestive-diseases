TI  - [Artificial nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease].
PG  - 629-34
AB  - Malnutrition is often a major clinical problem in patients affected by IBD.
      Assessment of nutritional status should be routinely carried out in these
      patients and, in case of severe malnutrition, artificial nutrition should be
      used. In ulcerative colitis and in Crohn disease localized to colonic segments
      both Parenteral Nutrition (PN) and Enteral Nutrition (EN) have similar results as
      support treatments but they have no primary therapeutic effects and then they are
      indicated only in case of severe malnutrition and/or when a surgical procedure is
      planned. Some theoretical advantages derived from supplementation of short chain 
      fatty acids and omega3-series is still debated. More evident are the advantages
      of nutritional support in Crohn enteritis. Both PN and EN have a role as a
      primary therapy capable to induce remission although these results are not
      prolonged in time when nutrition is not associated with pharmacological
      treatments. Experiments of pharmaco-nutrition with glutamine and fish fatty acid 
      have to be validated in the clinical practice. In case of integrity of the small 
      bowel and tolerance of the patient, EN is preferable to PN for its lower costs
      and reduced related complications. PN is still indicated in more severe cases or 
      in acute phase when the need of restoring rapidly the hydroelectrolitic and
      nitrogen/caloric balance prevails.

TI  - [Eosinophilic colitis. A report of two cases with non conventional treatment].
PG  - 231-5
AB  - Eosinophilic colitis is a rare entity of unknown etiology characterized by
      diarrhea, abdominal pain, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Diagnosis includes
      histopathological infiltration of more than 20 eosinophils in colon. It is
      frequently associated with milk hypersensitivity and, less usual, with other
      foods and increased IgE. Histopthological appearance of eosinophil mediators has 
      been observed in the gut. It is sometimes related to the degree of infiltration
      of eosinophils in the gut as well as to the disease severity. There is not an
      established treatment for this entity, although systemic steroids have been used 
      with certain efficacy. However, there is a recurrence of the symptoms when the
      therapy stops, besides the well known side effects of the long-term use of
      steroids. Cromolyn inhibits mast cell degranulation and prevents liberation of
      mediators. It is successful in certain cases, specially the severe ones. However,
      it is not available for its use in our country. Ketotifen, as last resource in
      our patients with bad response to habitual treatment and restriction diet, was
      used. Although its use is controversial, we consider that stabilizing mast cell
      membrane with subsequent inhibition of degranulation and recruitment of
      eosinophils to sites of inflammation, would also restrain histamine liberation
      and blockage of H1 receptors, which would diminish local damage induced by
      eosinophils. Nonetheless ketotifen mechanism of action is unknown, our patients
      improved after treatment with this drug.

TI  - Serologic testing with ANCA, ASCA, and anti-OmpC in children and young adults
      with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis: diagnostic value and correlation
      with disease phenotype.
PG  - 2235-41
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Serologic testing is increasingly being utilized to evaluate children
      with suspected inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of this paper was to
      evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of a currently available panel involving
      four antibodies: deoxyribonuclease (DNase)-sensitive perinuclear antineutrophil
      cytoplasmic antibody (DNase-sensitive pANCA), IgA and IgG antibodies to
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae (IgA and IgG ASCA), and antibody to Escherichia coli
      outer membrane porin (anti-OmpC). We also wished to determine whether antibody
      levels correlated with disease activity, and whether a specific antibody pattern 
      correlated with location and outcome of disease in children. METHODS: We studied 
      sera from 81 children with Crohn's disease (CD), 54 with ulcerative colitis (UC),
      and 63 controls. Clinical data, disease activity, and disease diagnosis were
      gathered at the time of serum sampling, and charts were re-reviewed at time of
      the study to determine long-term outcome. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was
      utilized to determine titers of antibodies to ASCA, DNase-sensitive pANCA, and
      anti-OmpC; the presence of perinuclear staining for ANCA was confirmed by
      immunofluorescence. RESULTS: We identified ASCA antibodies in 44% of CD patients,
      0% of UC patients, and 1 control patient. DNase-sensitive pANCA antibodies were
      found in 70% of patients with UC, 18% of CD patients (predominantly Crohn's
      colitis), and 3% of controls. Anti-OmpC as an isolated assay had low sensitivity 
      for both CD (24%) and UC (11%), and displayed a 5% false-positive rate. However, 
      anti-OmpC did identify a small number of IBD patients not detected by the other
      assays. If any one or more of the four antibodies was positive, the overall
      sensitivity of the four antibody panel was 65% for CD and 76% for UC, with a
      specificity of 94%. Patients who were ASCA-positive were more likely to have
      disease of the ileum or ileum and right colon than patients who were
      ASCA-negative (58%vs 18%, p < 0.001). Patients with ASCA-positive were also more 
      likely to require ileocecal resection (36%vs 13%, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A
      currently available commercial antibody panel has good sensitivity and excellent 
      specificity for CD and UC. The ASCA antibodies, while highly specific for CD,
      identify predominantly the subset of children with disease of the ileum and
      ascending colon who may be at increased risk of surgery.

TI  - Reduced joint pain after short-term duodenal administration of seal oil in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease: comparison with soy oil.
PG  - 1088-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rheumatic joint pain is a common extra-intestinal complication of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Because the high ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty
      acids (FAs) of the Western diet might promote rheumatic disorders, we sought to
      compare the effects of short-term duodenal administration of n-3-rich seal oil
      and n-6-rich soy oil on IBD-related joint pain. METHODS: Nineteen patients with
      IBD-related joint pain were included in the study; 9 had Crohn disease and 10 had
      ulcerative colitis. Ten millilitres seal oil (n = 10) or soy oil (n = 9) was
      self-administered through a nasoduodenal feeding tube 3 times daily for 10 days. 
      RESULTS: Compared with soy oil treatment, seal oil significantly reduced the
      duration of morning stiffness (P = 0.024), number of tender joints (P = 0.035),
      intensity of pain (P = 0.025) and the doctor's scoring of rheumatic disease
      activity (P = 0.025) at the end of the 10-day treatment period. Analysis of the
      effects as area under the curve (area between the curve and baseline, zero) for
      the entire period from start of treatment until 6 months' post-treatment
      suggested a long-lasting beneficial effect of seal oil administration on joint
      pain, whereas soy oil tended (not significantly) to aggravate the condition.
      Consistently, the serum ratios of n-6 to n-3 FAs (P < 0.01) and arachidonic acid 
      to eicosapentaenoic acid (P < 0.01) were reduced after treatment with seal oil.
      CONCLUSION: The results suggest distinctive, differential prolonged effects on
      IBD-related joint pain of short-term duodenal administration of n-3-rich seal oil
      (significant improvement) and n-6-rich soy oil (tendency to exacerbation).

TI  - Relevance of serologic studies in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 482-7
AB  - The serologic panel for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is rapidly expanding.
      Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae
      mannan antibodies (ASCA) have remained the most widely studied markers, but
      immune reactivity against a new group of bacterial antigens such as I2, OmpC
      (outer membrane porin C), and flagellin, has been described in Crohn's disease.
      Several clinical avenues have been explored, such as the usefulness of serologic 
      markers as screening tools for IBD and in accelerating a diagnosis in patients
      with indeterminate colitis. Another area of interest is disease stratification.
      Emerging data suggest there is a diversity of qualitative and quantitative
      responses to environmental antigens that differs among groups of IBD patients and
      may be associated with different clinical behaviors. As a result, it may be
      possible to tailor therapy on the basis of serologic responses. Prospective
      studies are needed before translating this concept into clinical practice.
      Clustering of IBD patients into more homogeneous subgroups based on antibody
      responses may help to unravel the pathophysiology of subsets of IBD.

TI  - Clinical outcome and factors predictive of recurrence after enterocutaneous
      fistula surgery.
PG  - 825-31
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recent experience with surgery for enterocutaneous fistulae (ECF) at a
      specialist colorectal unit is reviewed to define factors relating to a successful
      surgical outcome. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: ECF cause significant morbidity and
      mortality and need experienced surgical management. Previous publications have
      concentrated on mortality resulting from fistulae, while factors affecting
      recurrence have not previously been a focus of analysis. METHODS: Records were
      reviewed of patients who had ECF surgery (1994-2001). Management strategy
      involved early drainage of sepsis and nutritional support prior to elective ECF
      repair, with selective defunctioning proximal stoma formation. RESULTS: A total
      of 205 patients were available (89 males, 43%; median age, 51 years; range,
      16-86) years). ECF were related to Crohn's disease in 95, ulcerative colitis in
      18, diverticular disease in 17, carcinoma in 25 (16 after radiotherapy), mesh
      ventral hernia repair in 21, and other causes in 29. Forty-one (20%) had
      undergone attempted fistula repair at other institutions. Initial management
      included CT-guided drainage of an intra-abdominal abscess in 23 patients, and
      total parenteral nutrition in 74 (36%). A total of 203 patients had definitive
      ECF repair. Forty-four had oversewing or wedge resection of the fistula, and 159 
      had resection and reanastomosis of the involved small bowel segment or ileocolic 
      anastomosis. Ninety-day operative mortality was 3.5%. A total of 42 (20.5%)
      patients developed ECF recurrence within 3 months. Multivariate analysis
      demonstrated that recurrence was more likely after oversewing (36%) than
      resection (16%, P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: A strategy of drainage of acute sepsis, 
      maintenance of nutritional support prior to surgery, and selective use of PS
      allows for primary closure in 80% of complicated ECF. Resection should be
      performed when feasible.

PG  - 56-68
AB  - Probiotics have been defined by The Food Agricultural Organization/World Health
      Organization (FAO/WHO) as "live microorganisms which when administered in
      adequate amounts confer a health benefit to the host." They have been used for
      centuries in the form of dairy-based fermented products, but the potential use of
      probiotics as a form of medical nutrition therapy has not received formal
      recognition. A detailed literature review (from 1950 through February 2004) of
      English-language articles was undertaken to find articles showing a relationship 
      between probiotic use and medical conditions. Medical conditions that have been
      reportedly treated or have the potential to be treated with probiotics include
      diarrhea, gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel
      disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), cancer, depressed immune
      function, inadequate lactase digestion, infant allergies, failure-to-thrive,
      hyperlipidemia, hepatic diseases, Helicobacter pylori infections, genitourinary
      tract infections, and others. The use of probiotics should be further
      investigated for possible benefits and side-effects in patients affected by these
      medical conditions.

TI  - Infliximab therapy in pediatric Crohn's pouchitis.
PG  - 417-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We describe the prolonged clinical benefit of murine chimeric
      antitumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha monoclonal antibody, infliximab, on
      pediatric patients with Crohn's disease and ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA). 
      METHODS: A retrospective review of patients originally diagnosed with ulcerative 
      colitis, status post colectomy and IPAA, who developed findings compatible with
      Crohn's disease was undertaken. Refractory pouchitis developed in all patients as
      well as protracted symptoms of diarrhea, abdominal pain, joint pain, and
      incontinence. All patients received infliximab. RESULTS: Four pediatric patients 
      (2 males and 2 females) with mean age of 14.5 years (range 11-18 years) were
      studied. The development of perianal fistulas in 2 patients, granuloma on biopsy 
      in 1 patient and perianal skin tag in 1 patient, led to a diagnosis change of CD.
      After failure to respond to antibiotics, aminosalicylates and immunomodulators
      such as azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), all patients were treated with 
      infliximab. Patients received infliximab infusions at a dose of 5 mg/kg,
      initially at weeks 0, 2 and 6 and subsequently at 8 weeks intervals in
      combination with an immunomodulator drug. All patients showed marked improvement 
      clinically, endoscopically, and histologically. CONCLUSION: Infliximab can be
      used successfully for the treatment of pediatric patients with Crohn's disease
      and IPAA who are refractory to conventional therapies.

TI  - Intestinal interleukin-13 in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease patients.
PG  - 593-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a multifunctional cytokine whose net
      principle action is to diminish inflammatory responses. Dysregulation of IL-13
      production has been proposed to contribute to intestinal inflammation in
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Previous studies implicate IL-13 in
      IBD pathogenesis; however, they fail to accurately reflect in vivo intestinal
      IL-13 production. We evaluate IL-13, IL-6, and IL-1beta elaborations from colonic
      organ cultures of pediatric IBD patients METHODS: Endoscopic lamina propria
      biopsies or surgical specimens from pediatric patients with IBD were organ
      cultured and supernatants evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for
      IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-13. RESULTS: IL-13 concentrations were significantly
      reduced in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients when compared with normal controls (P
      = 0.002) and Crohn disease (CD) patients (P = 0.001). End-stage UC patients at
      colectomy had lower intestinal IL-13 production than all other UC patients (P =
      0.002). No significant correlation was found between IL-13 concentration and
      histologic disease severity (P = 0.134). CONCLUSIONS: Diminished intestinal IL-13
      production is present in UC patients and wanes further with clinical disease
      progression. These findings suggest that UC patients may be differentiated from
      CD patients by intestinal IL-13 quantitation, and UC patients may benefit from
      IL-13 enhancing therapies.

TI  - Diagnosis and treatment of ulcerative proctitis.
PG  - 733-40
AB  - Proctitis refers to inflammation of the rectum, a diagnosis made by endoscopic
      evaluation. Symptoms of proctitis include rectal bleeding, urgency, tenesmus,
      diarrhea or constipation, and occasionally rectal pain. The causes of proctitis
      include infection, medication, ischemia, radiation, and ulcerative proctitis.
      Ulcerative proctitis is an important and increasingly common subcategory of
      ulcerative colitis (UC) in which inflammation is limited to the rectum.
      Historically, oral aminosalicylates have been the mainstay of acute and
      maintenance therapy. A growing body of data, however, indicates that topical
      aminosalicylates are effective first line agents in ulcerative proctitis and
      distal UC. Topical aminosalicylates act more effectively and rapidly to induce
      and maintain remission compared with their oral counterparts or topical steroids.
      Rarely ulcerative proctitis is refractory to topical therapy and in these
      instances systemic corticosteroids, antibiotics, immunomodulators, or surgery is 
      required. This review highlights the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of
      ulcerative proctitis.

TI  - Influence of dietary factors on the clinical course of ulcerative colitis: a
      prospective cohort study.
PG  - 1479-84
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The causes of relapses of ulcerative colitis (UC) are
      unknown. Dietary factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of UC. The aim 
      of this study was to determine which dietary factors are associated with an
      increased risk of relapse of UC. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was
      performed with UC patients in remission, recruited from two district general
      hospitals, who were followed for one year to determine the effect of habitual
      diet on relapse. Relapse was defined using a validated disease activity index.
      Nutrient intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire and categorised
      into tertiles. Adjusted odds ratios for relapse were determined using
      multivariate logistic regression, controlling for non-dietary factors. RESULTS: A
      total of 191 patients were recruited and 96% completed the study. Fifty two per
      cent of patients relapsed. Consumption of meat (odds ratio (OR) 3.2 (95%
      confidence intervals (CI) 1.3-7.8)), particularly red and processed meat (OR 5.19
      (95% CI 2.1-12.9)), protein (OR 3.00 (95% CI 1.25-7.19)), and alcohol (OR 2.71
      (95% CI 1.1-6.67)) in the top tertile of intake increased the likelihood of
      relapse compared with the bottom tertile of intake. High sulphur (OR 2.76 (95% CI
      1.19-6.4)) or sulphate (OR 2.6 (95% CI 1.08-6.3)) intakes were also associated
      with relapse and may offer an explanation for the observed increased likelihood
      of relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Potentially modifiable dietary factors, such as a high
      meat or alcoholic beverage intake, have been identified that are associated with 
      an increased likelihood of relapse for UC patients. Further studies are needed to
      determine if it is the sulphur compounds within these foods that mediates the
      likelihood of relapse and if reducing their intake would reduce relapse
      frequency.

TI  - Controversies with aminosalicylates in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 104-17
AB  - Aminosalicylates have been shown to exhibit a wide range of anti-inflammatory and
      immunomodulatory properties. Since the discovery of sulfasalazine's efficacy in
      ulcerative colitis and the subsequent development of sulfa-free mesalamine
      delivery systems, aminosalicylates have evolved to become an integral part of our
      therapeutic armamentarium and are now first-line therapies for the treatment of
      mildly to moderately active inflammatory bowel disease and for maintenance of
      remissions after successful induction therapy. Despite the substantial body of
      evidence supporting the use of aminosalicylates in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
      disease, gaps in our evidence base and controversies surrounding aminosalicylates
      clinical application have emerged. In this review, issues of dose response and
      optimization of the treatment regimen in ulcerative colitis, the discrimination
      between oral mesalamine formulations in left-sided colitis, and their efficacy in
      active and quiescent Crohn's disease are discussed.

TI  - Review article: the role of nutrition in the treatment of inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 79-83
AB  - Nutrients may be involved in the modulation of the immune response through at
      least three different mechanisms. First, the intestinal ecosystem plays a pivotal
      role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, triggering the
      uncontrolled inflammatory response in genetically predisposed individuals.
      Nutrients, together with bacteria, are major components of, and can therefore
      influence, the intestinal environment. Second, as components of cell membranes,
      nutrients can mediate the expression of proteins involved in the immune response,
      such as cytokines, adhesion molecules and nitric oxide synthase. The composition 
      of lipids in the cell membrane is modified by dietary changes and can influence
      cellular responses. Indeed, various epidemiological, experimental and clinical
      data suggest that the immune response may be sensitive to changes in dietary
      composition. Finally, suboptimal levels of micronutrients are often found in both
      children and adults with inflammatory bowel disease, although, with the exception
      of iron and folate, it is unusual to discover symptoms attributable to these
      deficits. However, subclinical deficits may have a pathophysiological
      significance, as they may favour the self-perpetuation of the disease (due to
      defects in the mechanisms of tissue repair), cause defective defence against
      damage produced by oxygen free radicals and facilitate lipid peroxidation. These 
      events can occur even in clinically inactive or mildly active disease, as well as
      in the development of dysplasia in the intestinal mucosa. Some dietary
      manipulations have been attempted as primary treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, 
      and specially formulated diets for enteral nutrition have proved to be an
      effective treatment for Crohn's disease. Most trials, although lacking sufficient
      patient numbers, have demonstrated a role for dietary manipulation as primary
      therapy for inflammatory disease. Dietary lipids are one of the most active
      nutritional substrates modulating the immune response. Recently, it has been
      demonstrated that lipids may be a key factor explaining the therapeutic effect of
      clinical nutrition in Crohn's disease.

TI  - Review article: skin complications associated with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 50-3
AB  - Cutaneous manifestations are well-recognized complications of Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis. The incidence of these manifestations varies widely but, at
      the time of diagnosis, the mean incidence is around 10%. During the course of the
      disease, a great variety of skin lesions may develop, many of which are secondary
      to granulomatous cutaneous disease, reactive skin eruptions, nutritional
      deficiency and other associated conditions. The disorders that are directly
      related to the inflammatory process of Crohn's disease include perianal and
      peristomal ulcers and fistulae, metastatic Crohn's disease and oral granulomatous
      lesions. Histologically, the features are similar to those found in the inflamed 
      bowel. These lesions usually respond to treatment of the underlying intestinal
      disease. The most common forms of reactive skin eruption are erythema nodosum and
      pyoderma gangrenosum. Certain subsets of patients are more susceptible to the
      development of erythema nodosum; in a previous report from our group, erythema
      nodosum was seen mainly in females, and in patients with colonic involvement
      and/or arthritis. This manifestation tends to occur during the first 2 years of
      the clinical course of the disease and may recur in approximately one-half of
      cases. Infliximab is highly effective in healing refractory lesions of erythema
      nodosum and pyoderma gangrenosum. Manifestations that are secondary to
      nutritional deficiency or associated conditions include acrodermatitis
      enteropathica, psoriasis and autoimmune disorders. For most of the cutaneous
      manifestations, the primary therapeutic target remains the bowel. Early
      aggressive therapy can minimize severe complications and maintenance treatment
      may prevent some devastating consequences.

TI  - Guidelines for treatment of ulcerative colitis in children.
PG  - 494-6
AB  - This paper introduces the guidelines for treatment of ulcerative colitis in
      children, created by the working group of the Japanese Society for Pediatric
      Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (Chair: Yuichiro Yamashiro) and the
      Japanese Society for Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) (Chair: Akio
      Kobayashi). The ideas of the working group, with regard to the fundamental
      differences in medical treatment between children and adults, included: (1) for
      children, intensive medical treatment including appropriate systemic management
      is important during the acute phase of illness. (2) Treatment with steroids,
      which can cause growth disturbances, should not be continued for long periods of 
      time. (3) Pulsed steroid therapy, selective removal of blood cells, and
      intravenous infusion of cyclosporin should be included in the therapeutic option 
      for severe and fluminant cases.

TI  - Comparison of serological markers of inflammatory bowel disease with clinical
      diagnosis in children.
PG  - 240-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our purpose was to study the concordance of serological tests for
      inflammatory bowel disease with clinical diagnosis established by traditional
      testing in children. METHODS: All children seen in our division who had IBD
      Diagnostic System (ie, pANCA, ASCA IgA, and ASCA IgG) performed over a 21-month
      period (June 1998 to February 2000) were identified. Their medical records were
      reviewed for basic demographics, test results (endoscopy, histology, and
      radiology), IBD Diagnostic System results, and patient symptoms/medications.
      Results of the IBD Diagnostic System were compared with several patient
      characteristics including age, sex, absence/presence of symptoms, medication use,
      disease activity and duration. RESULTS: One hundred seven patients were divided
      into 6 groups based on clinical diagnosis and IBD Diagnostic System results. The 
      sensitivity, specificity and +/- predictive values of the IBD Diagnostic System
      for ulcerative colitis were 69.2, 95.1, 90.0, and 87.1%, respectively, and for
      Crohn's disease were 54.1, 96.8, 90.9, and 80.8%, respectively. Overall, the
      results of the IBD Diagnostic System were concordant with the clinical diagnosis 
      in 76 of the 107 (71%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, the specificity 
      of IBD Diagnostic System is better than the sensitivity; the sensitivity is
      better for ulcerative colitis than Crohn's disease (69.2% vs 54.1%). The low
      sensitivity, especially for Crohn's disease, precludes the possibility that the
      IBD Diagnostic System can replace traditional studies when evaluating for
      inflammatory bowel disease. Though we do not exclude inflammatory bowel disease
      solely by IBD Diagnostic System results, it is reassuring to note that all
      patients without clinical evidence of inflammatory bowel disease also had
      negative IBD Diagnostic System results.

TI  - Chronic granulomatous disease caused by a deficiency in p47(phox) mimicking
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 690-5
AB  - We describe 2 cases of autosomal recessive chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) in
      2 sisters presenting with a picture consistent with inflammatory bowel disease.
      The index case is a 10-year-old girl with a history of refractory Crohn's colitis
      treated with aggressive immunosuppressive therapy whose course subsequently was
      complicated by central nervous system aspergillosis. Additional evaluation showed
      a diagnosis of CGD, an underlying immunodeficiency in which phagocytes fail to
      produce microbicidal reactive oxygen intermediates because of inherited defects
      in the reduced form of nicotinamide-adenine phosphate dinucleotide (NADPH)
      oxidase. The diagnosis of a typically X-linked inherited disease in our female
      patient suggested that she had 1 of the 3 less common autosomal recessive forms
      of the disease. This was confirmed by studies showing the absence of the
      p47(phox) subunit of NADPH oxidase in her neutrophils and the presence of a
      homozygous dinucleotide deletion in the neutrophil cytosolic factor 1 gene that
      encodes p47(phox). Additional analyses of members of the patient's immediate
      family showed the same homozygous mutation in 2 siblings, 1 of whom also
      developed chronic colitis consistent with a diagnosis of Crohn's disease. These 2
      cases emphasize the importance of high clinical suspicion for an alternative
      diagnosis of immune deficiency in the setting of presumed inflammatory bowel
      disease and opportunistic infection.

TI  - Resistant starches and health.
PG  - 769-74
AB  - It was initially hypothesized that resistant starches, i.e., starch that enters
      the colon, would have protective effects on chronic colonic diseases, including
      reduction of colon cancer risk and in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Recent
      studies have confirmed the ability of resistant starch to increase fecal bulk,
      increase the molar ratio of butyrate in relation to other short-chain fatty
      acids, and dilute fecal bile acids. However the ability of resistant starch to
      reduce luminal concentrations of compounds that are damaging to the colonic
      mucosa, including fecal ammonia, phenols, and N-nitroso compounds, still requires
      clear demonstration. As such, the effectiveness of resistant starch in preventing
      or treating colonic diseases remains to be assessed. Nevertheless, there is a
      fraction of what has been termed resistant (RS1) starch, which enters the colon
      and acts as slowly digested or lente carbohydrate in the small intestine. Foods
      in this class are low glycemic index and have been shown to reduce the risk of
      chronic disease. They have been associated with systemic physiological effects
      such as reduced postprandial insulin levels and higher HDL cholesterol levels.
      Consumption of low glycemic index foods has been shown to be related to
      reductions in risk of coronary heart disease and Type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes
      has in turn been related to a higher risk of colon cancer. If carbohydrates have 
      a protective role in colon cancer prevention this may lie partly in the systemic 
      effects of low glycemic index foods. The colonic advantages of different
      carbohydrates, varying in their glycemic index and resistant starch content,
      therefore, remain to be determined. However, as recent positive research findings
      continue to mount, there is reason for optimism over the possible health
      advantages of those resistant starches, which are slowly digested in the small
      intestine.

PG  - 67-90, ix
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), collectively known as
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are idiopathic, life-long, destructive chronic
      inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract that typically manifest
      during late childhood and adolescence. These chronic relapsing diseases may have 
      devastating effects on patients. New medical progress in IBD includes genetics,
      gut ecology and microflora, immune mechanisms, and targeted biologic therapies.
      This article reviews the current understanding of the etiopathogenesis of IBD,
      the emerging epidemiologic data in pediatric IBD, clinical presentations,
      diagnostic evaluation, distinctions between adult and pediatric-onset disease,
      and a comprehensive review of both conventional and new therapies, highlighting
      age-specific issues such as growth, sexual delay, and psychological and
      behavioral health.

TI  - Infliximab is effective in acute but not chronic childhood ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 166-70
AB  - PURPOSE: The authors report their experience with infliximab in pediatric
      patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Fourteen patients were reviewed. 
      Group 1 included five patients with newly diagnosed, fulminant colitis refractory
      to 7 to 10 days of intravenous steroids. Group 2 included four patients with
      ulcerative colitis in remission off steroid therapy who experienced relapse and
      were hospitalized with fulminant colitis refractory to intravenous steroids for 7
      to 10 days. Group 3 included five patients chronically dependent on steroids with
      colitis refractory to medical management. All patients were treated on an
      open-label basis with infliximab infusions of 5 mg/kg/dose at 0, 2, and 6 weeks
      and every 6 to 8 weeks thereafter. Follow-up was maintained for at least 6 weeks.
      Clinical status was scored with the Lichtiger Colitis Activity Index (LCAI) at
      each visit. LCAI >or=10 was considered treatment failure. We defined success as
      LCAI <or=2, a score consistent with UC remission. Response was categorized for
      each group. RESULTS: All patients began the study with LCAI >or=11 before
      infliximab treatment. All group 1 patients experienced response to infliximab.
      All but one (75%) patient in group 2 had a response. Only one (20%) group 3
      patient had a response to infliximab. CONCLUSION: Infliximab was an effective
      agent in the treatment of acute UC in our patients. Long-term steroid use and
      emergency colectomy were avoided. Infliximab was less effective in patients who
      were dependent on steroids.

TI  - Mesalamine derivatives in the treatment of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 303-17, ix-x
AB  - The role of the aminosalicylates for induction therapy of mild moderate
      ulcerative colitis and as maintenance treatment has been substantiated by a large
      series of controlled clinical trials and confirmatory meta-analyses. Both
      sulfasalazine and newer derivatives are effective in preventing relapses. It
      remains to be determined whether certain high-risk groups of patients may benefit
      from higher doses of mesalamine induction or maintenance therapy. Mesalamine
      derivatives are also of benefit in the treatment of Crohn's disease.
      Sulfasalazine is likely not effective in the maintenance of Crohn's disease,
      although other mesalamine formulations continue to show some prophylactic
      activity after mesalamine induced remissions and for patients with disease of the
      ileum who have undergone surgical resection.

TI  - Medical therapy for ulcerative colitis 2004.
PG  - 1582-92
AB  - There continue to be evolutionary changes in the management of ulcerative colitis
      despite the fact that, aside from a variety of aminosalicylate formulations, no
      new therapies have been approved over the past few decades. Nevertheless, debates
      continue regarding the optimization of treatment with aminosalicylates and the
      short- and long-term benefits of immunomodulation in ulcerative colitis. This
      article focuses on the most recent clinical studies pertaining to the management 
      of ulcerative colitis and explores both the advances and controversies pertaining
      to aminosalicylate therapy, corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and the purine
      antimetabolites. Novel therapeutic approaches--including preliminary experience
      with biological therapies directed at tumor necrosis factor and other cytokines, 
      adhesion molecules, growth factors, and probiotics--will be reviewed. Recent data
      regarding potential chemoprevention in long-standing ulcerative colitis and
      management of postoperative complications and pouchitis will also be discussed.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel diseases in pediatric and adolescent patients: clinical,
      therapeutic, and psychosocial considerations.
PG  - 1550-60
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) primarily
      affect young adults, but in 15%-25% of cases, the initial disease starts in
      childhood. Many aspects of inflammatory bowel disease, including initial
      evaluation, nutritional support, medical and surgical intervention, and the
      direction of future research, are encountered in both adult and pediatric
      patients. However, it is important to delineate issues specific to pediatric
      patients, especially growth velocity impairment, derangements in and treatment of
      abnormal bone mineralization, and transitional care issues; the lack of extensive
      randomized, controlled pediatric therapeutic trials is also a concern. This
      article reviews the epidemiology of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease
      incidence and prevalence worldwide, clinical issues (including impairments of
      growth velocity and bone density), diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, and 
      psychosocial issues unique to pediatric patients. Future research directions
      defined by the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology,
      and Nutrition and opportunities provided by existing pediatric research databases
      are highlighted.

TI  - Tobacco and IBD: relevance in the understanding of disease mechanisms and
      clinical practice.
PG  - 481-96
AB  - Current smoking protects against ulcerative colitis and, after onset of the
      disease, improves its course, decreasing the need for colectomy. However, smoking
      increases the risk of developing Crohn's disease and worsens its course,
      increasing the need for steroids, immunosuppressants and reoperations. Smoking
      cessation aggravates ulcerative colitis and improves Crohn's disease. The effects
      of smoking are the sum of contradictory effects of various substances, including 
      nicotine and carbon monoxide, and are modulated by gender, genetic background,
      disease location and activity, cigarette dose and nicotine concentration. Smokers
      with ulcerative colitis should not be discouraged from stopping smoking but
      encouraged to stop, to reduce their risk of cardiopulmonary tobacco-related
      diseases. In Crohn's disease, smoking cessation has become a major therapeutic
      goal, particularly in young women and in patients with ileal involvement. A large
      amount of supportive information, use of nicotine-replacement therapies and
      antidepressants, and individual counselling might aid the patient in quitting.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease: a complex group of genetic disorders.
PG  - 451-62
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are complex genetic disorders resulting from the
      complex interplay between several genetic and environmental risk factors. The
      number of IBD genes is currently unknown but it is expected to be equal or higher
      to 8. None of these genes are expected to be neither necessary nor sufficient for
      disease development. Among the candidate genes investigated to date, only
      CARD15/NOD2 has been definitively associated with Crohn Disease (CD) but not
      Ulcerative Colitis (UC). This gene explains about 20% of the genetic
      predisposition to CD. Because it is involved in the innate immunity, it allows to
      speculate that CD is the result of a defect in host-bacteria interaction.
      However, it is not known if CD is caused by specific bacteria or the gut flora as
      a whole.

      with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 485-91
AB  - The hypothesis was studied that intestinal microbial metabolites play a role in
      the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. For that purpose, an in vitro
      model of the colon was inoculated with fresh feces of six healthy individuals and
      eight inflammatory bowel disease patients. Samples were taken from the model over
      time to analyze metabolites from both saccharolytic and proteolytic fermentation.
      Microbiotas from inflammatory bowel disease patients produced significantly more 
      short-chain fatty acids and ammonia than microbiotas from healthy individuals.
      Furthermore, the branched-chain fatty acid production was 25% higher after
      inoculation with microbiotas from patients than after inoculation with
      microbiotas from healthy individuals. Phenolic compounds were produced by all
      microbiotas, with large interindividual variation. The production of (potentially
      toxic) metabolites may play a role in the onset or chronicity of inflammatory
      bowel disease, because they were produced in higher amounts by microbiotas from
      these patients than by microbiotas from healthy individuals.

AB  - Malnutrition is state of organism with import of energy and other nutritional
      factors lower then consumption, leading in certain period, to deviation from
      normal, or changes in some functions. Patients with gastrointestinal diseases are
      prone to malnutrition states because of basic functions in absorption of
      nutritional substances. Most common causes are inflammatory bowel diseases
      (ulcerative colitis and Crohns disease especially), different digestive fistulas 
      (proximal parts), chronic pancreatitis, chronic liver diseases and malignant
      tumors of digestive tube.

AB  - UNLABELLED: There is an enigma of inflammatory bowel diseases, despite
      significant advantages during last 10 years in medicamentous and surgical
      treatment. Ulcerative colitis and Crohns disease are chronic with remissions and 
      recidives. Crohns disease involves any part of digestive tube. Histological
      changes in ulcerative colitis are: inflammation of mucosa and submucosal tissue, 
      crypt abscesses and ulcerations, pseudopolpys, bowel shortening and toxic
      megacolon in severe inflammation. In Crohns disease, transmural inflammation,
      "jumping lesions", deeper ulcerations, coble-stone mucosa, progressive fibrosis, 
      granuloma with gigantic epithelial cells. TREATMENT: ulcerative colitis:
      mesalazine, rectal 5-ASA and hydrocortisone enemas, surgery. Crohns disease:
      mesalazine and prednisolone. For terminal ilcitis, corticosteroid budesonid could
      be applied. Severe symptomatic disease: hospitalization, parenteral nutrition,
      antibiotics, prednisone, surgery in partial bowel obstruction, fistulas,
      abscessus, perforation.

TI  - Medications as a source of human exposure to phthalates.
PG  - 751-3
AB  - Phthalates are a group of multifunctional chemicals used in consumer and personal
      care products, plastics, and medical devices. Laboratory studies show that some
      phthalates are reproductive and developmental toxicants. Recently, human studies 
      have shown measurable levels of several phthalates in most of the U.S. general
      population. Despite their widespread use and the consistent toxicologic data on
      phthalates, information is limited on sources and pathways of human exposure to
      phthalates. One potential source of exposure is medications. The need for
      site-specific dosage medications has led to the use of enteric coatings that
      allow the release of the active ingredients into the small intestine or in the
      colon. The enteric coatings generally consist of various polymers that contain
      plasticizers, including triethyl citrate, dibutyl sebacate, and phthalates such
      as diethyl phthalate (DEP) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP). In this article we report
      on medications as a potential source of exposure to DBP in a man who took Asacol 
      [active ingredient mesalamine (mesalazine)] for the treatment of ulcerative
      colitis. In a spot urine sample from this man collected 3 months after he started
      taking Asacol, the concentration of monobutyl phthalate, a DBP metabolite, was
      16,868 ng/mL (6,180 micro g/g creatinine). This concentration was more than two
      orders of magnitude higher than the 95th percentile for males reported in the
      1999-2000 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The
      patient's urinary concentrations of monoethyl phthalate (443.7 ng/mL, 162.6 micro
      g/g creatinine), mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (3.0 ng/mL, 1.1 micro g/g
      creatinine), and monobenzyl phthalate (9.3 ng/mL, 3.4 micro g/g creatinine) were 
      unremarkable compared with the NHANES 1999-2000 values. Before this report, the
      highest estimated human exposure to DBP was more than two orders of magnitude
      lower than the no observable adverse effect level from animal studies. Further
      research is necessary to determine the proportional contribution of medications, 
      as well as personal care and consumer products, to a person's total phthalate
      burden.

TI  - Do serological markers and cytokines determine the indeterminate?
PG  - S51-6
AB  - There is a general sense that indeterminate colitis (IC) runs an aggressive
      clinical course, is medically refractory, and is associated with higher pouch
      failure rates following restorative proctocolectomy. The question has been raised
      whether IC can be assigned to a diagnosis of Crohn's disease or ulcerative
      colitis through the characterization of immunogenetic similarities, or whether IC
      may represent a distinct subgroup within these heterogeneous disorders. In this
      article, the use of serologic markers, genetics, and immune responses to
      understand the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and define
      clinically important subgroups of patients will be discussed. Then, how these
      scientific advances have been applied to the entity of IC will be reviewed.
      Importantly, a recent prospective study suggests that the absence of
      IBD-associated serologic markers defines the majority of IC as a separate entity 
      within the spectrum of IBD. The development of serologic, genetic, and immune
      response markers will allow for rational description of clinically important
      subgroups, redefine natural history, and predict responses to therapy in IBD.

TI  - Results of surgical removal of the pouch after failed restorative
      proctocolectomy.
PG  - 869-75
AB  - PURPOSE: Restorative proctocolectomy is the elective surgical procedure of choice
      for ulcerative colitis and familial adenomatous polyposis. Most patients have a
      satisfactory outcome, but at ten years 15 percent or more will have failed,
      needing indefinite defunctioning or excision of the pouch. There is little
      information on the morbidity of pouch excision. The study was designed to present
      the early results of surgical removal of the pouch after failed restorative
      proctocolectomy with reference to the indications and intermediate complications,
      particularly of the perineal wound. METHODS: Between 1977 and 2002, 996 patients 
      underwent a restorative proctocolectomy at our hospital and 245 patients were
      referred for potential salvage. The pouch was excised in 58 and 10 patients
      respectively. There were 40 females and 28 males (median age, 34 (14-65) years)
      including 47 with ulcerative colitis, 10 with Crohn's disease, and 11 with
      familial adenomatous polyposis. The median follow-up was 79 (range, 3-312) months
      from excision. RESULTS: There was one (1.4 percent) postoperative death. The
      overall morbidity rate was 62.3 percent (immediate 30 days (25 percent), late
      (53.7 percent)). Thirty-six patients (53.7 percent) were readmitted on 67
      occasions for a late complication. The risk of readmission from the time of pouch
      excision was 38 and 58 percent at one and five years, respectively. Surgical
      treatment was required during 48 of these readmissions. A persistent perineal
      sinus was the most common late complication. The perineal wound was not healed at
      6 months in 27 patients (40 percent) and at 12 months in 7 patients (10 percent).
      No factor, including age at the time of pouch excision, gender, indication for
      excision, or final histologic diagnosis, was associated with an unhealed perineal
      wound. Two males (7 percent) had impotence. One female suffered from short-bowel 
      syndrome with the need of permanent parenteral nutrition. The median overall
      hospital stay for all admissions was 20 (range, 8-220) days. CONCLUSIONS: Pouch
      excision is associated with high morbidity. Perineal wound-delayed healing is the
      commonest late complication and often requires further surgery.

TI  - Human antichimeric antibody in children and young adults with inflammatory bowel 
      disease receiving infliximab.
PG  - 502-8
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pediatric studies on immunogenicity of infliximab have not been
      published. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of human
      antichimeric antibody (HACA), relationship to infusion reactions (IR), and the
      role of concomitant immunomodulatory therapies. METHODS: An inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) database was queried, and a retrospective review of patients who
      had HACA performed was undertaken. RESULTS: HACA was conclusively determined in
      34 patients with IBD (14 male, Crohn disease/ulcerative colitis: 30/4), median
      age 14.8 years (range, 6.4-22.5 years). Twenty-nine (85.3%) patients were
      receiving immunomodulatory therapy. A total of 234 infliximab infusions were
      administered (mean, 6.9; range, 1-26). HACA was detected in 12 (35.3%) patients. 
      IR occurred in 8 (23.5%) patients. HACA-positive patients had a higher proportion
      of infusions associated with IR than did HACA-negative patients (P < 0.01). HACA 
      levels > or =8.0 microg/mL were more likely to be associated with IR (P = 0.03). 
      Levels of > or = 8.0 microg/mL were more common in patients who had an average
      interval between infliximab infusions of 8 weeks or less (P = 0.04). Concomitant 
      immunomodulatory therapy was associated with a lower risk of developing HACA (P =
      0.02) and lower titer of HACA (P = 0.04). Patients did not have HACA at a greater
      rate when there was an extended interval (more than 12 weeks) between infliximab 
      infusions (P = 0.89). CONCLUSIONS: In children and adolescents with IBD, HACA
      formation is related to IR and to the duration of response to treatment.
      Immunomodulatory agents seem to have a protective role against development of
      HACA or high titers of antibodies. The interval between infusions does not
      influence the development of HACA.

AB  - Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease result from an interaction between genetic
      and environmental factors. Only one gene, NOD2/CARD15, has been clearly
      identified; a minority of people with alteration of this gene develop Crohn's
      disease. The NOD2/CARD15 protein is thought to be involved in defence against
      intracellular bacteria. This supports the idea that Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis result from altered immunological responses to the normal
      intestinal flora. Life expectancy is normal in ulcerative colitis and nearly so
      in Crohn's disease, but both conditions cause considerable morbidity.
      Approximately 80% of patients with Crohn's disease eventually require surgery,
      and about 25% of patients with ulcerative colitis require colectomy. Treatment of
      ulcerative colitis is generally by corticosteroids for acute disease and
      mesalazine for maintenance, but the range of therapies for Crohn's disease is
      expanding. Alternative therapies include immunosuppressives, enteral nutrition,
      antibiotics, anti-TNF antibody (infliximab), corticosteroids, and surgery. High
      dosages of corticosteroids may provide symptomatic relief in Crohn's disease but 
      do not affect the long term natural history of the disease, and management
      strategies should avoid using steroids whenever possible.

TI  - Infliximab in pediatric ulcerative colitis: two-year follow-up.
PG  - 298-301
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The role of infliximab in treating pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC) 
      is not defined. The authors previously have described their experience with the
      open label use of infliximab in nine children with moderate to severe UC. The aim
      of this study was to describe the outcome of these patients after a minimum
      2-year follow-up and to describe the responses of eight additional patients to
      this medication. METHODS: The authors reviewed all pediatric patients with UC who
      received infliximab at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia from its first use
      until February 2003. Tolerance of the infusions and adverse events were recorded.
      RESULTS: Follow-up information for a minimum of 2 years was reviewed for the nine
      initial patients. A total of 73 infliximab infusions were administered to these
      patients. Seven of nine (78%) patients were considered to be responders to the
      initial dose of infliximab. Two of these patients became nonresponders within 9
      months of the first dose of infliximab and underwent colectomy. Of the remaining 
      five (56%) patients with sustained response, two continue to receive infliximab
      infusions and three are doing well without infliximab. One patient experienced an
      infusion reaction, and one experienced herpes zoster infection. We have treated
      eight additional UC patients with infliximab. Seven (88%) patients were
      considered responders. One responder experienced relapse within 2 months.
      Overall, a short-term improvement was seen in 14 of 17 (82%) patients, and
      sustained improvement in 10 of 16 (63%) patients followed up for more than 9
      months. All five patients with severe or fulminant UC, unresponsive to 2 weeks of
      intravenous corticosteroid therapy, experienced improvement with infliximab.
      Infliximab was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Infliximab is associated with short-
      and long-term clinical improvement in children and adolescents with moderate to
      severe UC.

PG  - 226-8
AB  - UNLABELLED: Gastrointestinal manifestations of Kawasaki disease are usually
      limited to stomatitis, paralytic ileus, and hydrops of the gallbladder. We report
      a case of Kawasaki disease complicated with hemophagocytosis and ischemic
      colitis. CASE REPORT: A 5-year-old girl with Kawasaki disease presented with
      hemophagocytosis that responded to gamma-globulin therapy. On day 4 she had
      abdominal pain and diarrhea. CT scan showed features suggesting ischemic colitis.
      Symptoms resolved on total parenteral nutrition. CONCLUSION: Ischemic colitis and
      hemophagocytosis are potential severe complications of Kawasaki disease.

TI  - A high degree of aneuploidy, loss of p53 gene, and low soluble p53 protein serum 
      levels are detected in ulcerative colitis patients.
PG  - 304-13
AB  - PURPOSE: The causes for the increased risk of colorectal cancer associated with
      ulcerative colitis have not been fully defined. Colonic tissue of ulcerative
      colitis patients was examined for changes in chromosome-17-centromere copy
      number, loss of the p53 gene, and alterations in serum levels of the 53-kDa
      protein. This study was performed under the assumption that these molecular
      events correlate with ulcerative colitis status and duration. METHODS: Ulcerative
      colitis patients (n = 42) and healthy controls (n = 37) participated in the
      study. All participants were histopathologically and medically diagnosed. The
      stage of ulcerative colitis patients was stratified according to increasing risk 
      factors for the development of colorectal cancer: left-sided colitis, pancolitis,
      sclerosing cholangitis, and dysplasia-associated lesions or masses. Changes in
      centromere number of chromosome 17 alone or in association with changes in copy
      number of the p53 gene were analyzed in colon tissue biopsies by fluorescence in 
      situ hybridization. Serum p53 level was determined in blood samples by
      immunoprecipitation followed by separation using high-pressure liquid
      chromatography. RESULTS: Changes in chromosome 17 and p53 copy number and lower
      levels of serum p53 protein in ulcerative colitis patients directly correlated
      with colorectal cancer risk factors. All values significantly differed from
      controls. Significant direct correlations were obtained for ulcerative colitis
      disease duration, levels of p53 in the serum, and extent of aneuploidy.
      CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that in the colonic mucosa of ulcerative colitis
      patients, high levels of genomic instability, changes in p53 gene copy number,
      and lower levels of p53 in the serum directly correlate with the extent of
      disease duration and increased risk factors for colorectal cancer. Any of the
      measurements described herein can provide an acceptable prognostic tool in the
      assessment of colorectal cancer risk in ulcerative colitis patients.

TI  - Intraluminal irrigation with fibers improves mucosal inflammation and atrophy in 
      diversion colitis.
PG  - 197-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effect of irrigating the colorectal mucosa of
      patients with a colostomy using a solution of fibers. METHODS: Eleven patients
      (10 male and 1 female; mean age, 34 y; age range, 16-49 y) with loop colostomy
      due to trauma underwent endoscopic evaluation of the rectum and the proximal and 
      distal mucosa from the colostomy. An endoscopic score (range, 0-10) was used to
      quantify the intensity of the inflammation at the mucosa. Biopsies were taken
      from the colostomy border and from the rectum. The mean crypt depth of the five
      best-oriented glands was registered. Then the diverted colorectal segment was
      irrigated with a solution containing 5% fibers (10 g/d) for 7 d. The patients
      underwent repeated endoscopic and biopsy procedures, and then the colostomy was
      closed. RESULTS: The endoscopic score was higher (P < 0.01) at the distal border 
      (2, 0-5) and the rectum (4, 1-10) when compared with the proximal border (0,
      0-1). After treatment, the score at the diverted colon (1, 0-2) diminished (P =
      0.03). The macroscopic score of the rectum also decreased after the infusion (4, 
      1-10, versus 3, 0-4; P = 0.03). Crypt depth at the proximal mucosa was higher
      than at the diverted mucosa (301 +/- 36 microm versus 205 +/- 76 microm; P <
      0.01). After treatment, crypt depth at the diverted mucosa (280 +/- 64 microm)
      increased (P = 0.03). The rectum mucosa did not change before and after the
      treatment. CONCLUSION: Irrigation with fibers improves inflammation at the
      defunctionalized colon.

TI  - Idiopathic colitis following cardiac transplantation: three pediatric cases.
PG  - 464-8
AB  - Colitis can cause significant morbidity in pediatric solid organ transplant
      recipients. In many cases, despite intensive evaluation, a specific infectious,
      inflammatory, or immunologic etiology is not identified, and idiopathic colitis
      may be the ultimate diagnosis. We defined idiopathic colitis as the presence of
      gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain) with inflammatory 
      changes seen on intestinal biopsy in the absence of identifiable bowel disease.
      We describe three cases of idiopathic colitis following cardiac transplantation. 
      In each case, the post-transplant course was complicated by persistent abdominal 
      pain, diarrhea, and in two cases, vomiting. All three patients' post-transplant
      courses were marked by multiple graft rejection episodes, and all received
      intensified immune therapy in addition to usual maintenance immunosuppression.
      Differential diagnosis of the patients' gastrointestinal symptoms included drug
      side effect, indolent opportunistic infections, inflammatory bowel disease,
      post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease, and microvascular ischemic colitis. 
      Continued symptoms led these patients to extensive evaluation including imaging
      studies, endoscopy and tissue biopsy, and stool, blood and tissue cultures for
      viral, bacterial and parasitic pathogens. Definitive differentiation presented
      significant diagnostic challenge, and once identifiable etiologies were excluded,
      the diagnosis of idiopathic colitis was assigned. We conclude that idiopathic
      colitis following pediatric cardiac transplantation can be a cause of significant
      morbidity. Endoscopic evaluation of patients who present with gastrointestinal
      symptoms after transplant is warranted to identify the presence of idiopathic
      colitis once common causes are ruled out. Further study is needed to identify its
      incidence, etiology, therapeutic options and prognosis.

TI  - Treatment of inflammatory bowel disease: safety and tolerability issues.
PG  - S18-23
AB  - An examination is needed of the potential adverse effects of the agents most
      commonly used to treat inflammatory bowel disease. Most of these therapies can be
      used safely to induce or maintain remissions, although some aspects of monitoring
      for toxicity are necessary. Aminosalicylates, including sulfasalazine and
      mesalamine delivery systems, are most commonly associated with sulfa-related
      effects (sulfasalazine) or intolerance, with rare instances of nephritis,
      pulmonitis, hepatitis, or worsening colitis. The immunomodulators are most
      commonly associated with bone marrow suppression, hepatitis, and the risk of
      opportunistic infections. Methotrexate is contraindicated in pregnancy.
      Antibiotics used for inflammatory bowel disease are generally safe and well
      tolerated, although metronidazole carries a long-term risk of peripheral
      neuropathy. The well-recognized multitude of adverse effects from corticosteroids
      are eliminated or minimized when rapidly metabolized steroids, such as
      budesonide, are used.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease emergencies.
PG  - 1269-88
AB  - Emergency complications of IBD are rare, but may be life-threatening, require
      surgery, and result in permanent end organ damage. The most common complications 
      associated with UC are fulminant colitis, toxic megacolon, and bleeding. Each of 
      these complications may resolve with aggressive medical therapy but often result 
      in a total proctocolectomy. The most common complications associated with CD are 
      abscesses and intestinal obstruction. Although initial treatment includes medical
      treatment, these Crohn's-related complications usually require a surgical
      intervention and intestinal resection. Finally, the most common extraintestinal
      manifestations that present as an emergency include thromboembolic events, ocular
      complications, and hepatobiliary disease. Some of these complications may
      parallel the course of the underlying disease and respond to IBD treatment, but
      thromboemboli, uveitis, and PSC do not. In the last decade there has been an
      explosion of knowledge and discovery into the pathogenesis of IBD. These findings
      have led to better and earlier treatment of IBD that it is hoped will alter the
      natural course of disease and prevent many of the complications outlined in this 
      article.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease and hospital treatment in Italy: the RING multi-centre
      study.
PG  - 63-8
AB  - AIM: To explore the management of chronic inflammatory bowel disease,
      specifically Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, in Italian gastroenterology 
      units. METHODS: The RING (Ricerca Informatizzata in Gastroenterologia) project is
      an observational study collecting hospital discharge forms from 56 centres.
      Factors associated with the length of hospital stay were studied using
      multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: In 24 months starting from August
      2000, out of 29,376 hospital discharge forms, 2131 (7.3%) were collected for
      inflammatory bowel disease (1163 for Crohn's disease and 968 for ulcerative
      colitis). The Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis groups were compared
      according to demographic characteristics, diagnoses, procedures and hospital
      stay. In Crohn's disease, computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging,
      x-rays/barium enema, number of procedures and number of diagnoses were
      significantly associated with a hospital stay longer than 10 days. In ulcerative 
      colitis, this association was found for parenteral nutrition, malnutrition,
      computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging and number of procedures.
      CONCLUSIONS: Crohn's disease was confirmed as a disabling disorder requiring more
      frequent hospital treatment than ulcerative colitis. For the latter, parenteral
      nutrition and malnutrition were related to a longer hospital stay. The number of 
      procedures, especially abdominal computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging, 
      was a major item for both pathologies.

TI  - Short bowel syndrome and Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1069-72
AB  - Patients with Crohn's disease are at high risk for recurrent disease and often
      undergo multiple operations. Our aims were to evaluate surgical management and
      outcome of patients with Crohn's disease who develop short bowel syndrome (SBS)
      and to identify factors leading to this complication. We reviewed the records of 
      170 adult patients with SBS evaluated over a 20-year period. Thirty (18%) had
      Crohn's disease. SBS was defined as an intestinal remnant less than 180 cm with
      associated malabsorption. There were 20 women and 10 men ranging in age from 18
      to 62 years. Eighteen (60%) presented initially with ileocolonic disease, seven
      (23%) with colonic disease, and five (17%) with small intestinal disease. The
      interval from initial diagnosis to development of SBS ranged from 2 to 32 years, 
      with 21 patients (71%) having an interval greater than 15 years. The number of
      resections leading to SBS varied from 2 to 12 with 24 patients (80%) having four 
      or fewer resections. Nineteen patients (63%) had an ostomy. Small intestinal
      remnant length was less than 60 cm in 10 patients, 60 to 120 cm in six patients, 
      and greater than 120 cm in 14 patients. Only one patient underwent
      stricturoplasty before developing SBS. Five patients were initially diagnosed as 
      having ulcerative colitis and underwent a pouch procedure, which was subsequently
      resected. Twenty patients (67%) required parenteral nutrition. Three patients
      have undergone reversed intestinal segment to slow intestinal transit. Two
      patients underwent intestinal transplantation. Two patients have died: one from
      parenteral nutrition-related liver failure and the other after intestinal
      transplantation. Crohn's disease remains a common cause of SBS. Aggressive
      resectional therapy, surgical complications, and errors in initial diagnosis
      contribute to development of SBS in these patients. Selected patients are
      candidates for surgical therapy for SBS.

TI  - Presenting features of inflammatory bowel disease in Great Britain and Ireland.
PG  - 995-1000
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reports from individual referral centres suggest that a significant
      proportion of children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) present after
      prolonged delays and with impaired growth. AIMS: To prospectively document the
      presenting features, delay in presentation, disease localisation, and growth in
      newly diagnosed cases of IBD. METHODS: For 13 months, between June 1998 and June 
      1999, 3247 paediatricians, adult gastroenterologists, and surgeons across the UK 
      and Ireland were prospectively surveyed each month and asked to report every
      newly diagnosed case of childhood IBD. RESULTS: A total of 739 new IBD cases aged
      less than 16 years were identified. Only one quarter of Crohn's disease (CD)
      cases presented with the "classic triad" of diarrhoea, weight loss, and abdominal
      pain; nearly half did not report diarrhoea. The median delay from onset of
      symptoms to diagnosis was 5 months (mean 11 months), with one fifth having
      symptoms of more than one year. Delays were most common in CD and in younger
      children. Short stature was noted only in those with CD and not with ulcerative
      colitis. One fifth of CD cases had disease activity in the jejunum and this group
      had significantly reduced stature. Ileo-colonic involvement was documented in
      most CD cases, with only a small minority having isolated ileal or isolated
      colonic disease. Pan-colitis was reported in most UC cases, with very few having 
      only an isolated proctitis. CONCLUSIONS: Many children are diagnosed after
      prolonged delays and have growth failure. Improved knowledge of the presenting
      features of IBD, and earlier investigation of suspected cases, may help reduce
      the delays noted.

TI  - Hyperhomocystinemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 586-90
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Thromboembolism is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in 
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) 
      is a risk factor for vascular disease and has been implicated as a mediator of
      thromboembolic events in adults with IBD. The authors studied the link between
      tHcy and IBD in children, in whom associations may be clearer, and investigated
      associations with plasma von Willebrand factor antigen, a marker of vascular
      damage. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 43 patients with IBD (27
      Crohn disease, 9 ulcerative colitis, and 7 indeterminate colitis) and 46 control 
      subjects from a pediatric gastroenterology clinic. Plasma tHcy, plasma 5-methyl
      tetrahydrofolate, red cell folate, plasma vitamin B12, plasma von Willebrand
      factor antigen, and methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) genotype (for
      the C677T mutation) were measured. RESULTS: Plasma tHcy concentrations were
      higher in children with IBD than in control subjects, when corrected for age (P <
      0.05), and plasma tHcy was negatively correlated with plasma 5 methyl
      tetrahydrofolate (P < 0.0005). Plasma 5 methyl tetrahydrofolate and age were the 
      main predictors of plasma tHcy. Neither MTHFR genotype nor von Willebrand factor 
      showed any association with any other measure, and there were no differences
      between children with IBD and control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated plasma tHcy
      is a consequence of IBD in children, probably mediated by poor folate status
      associated with diet or the pathophysiology of the disease.

TI  - Epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of children with newly diagnosed
      inflammatory bowel disease in Wisconsin: a statewide population-based study.
PG  - 525-31
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of newly
      diagnosed pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in a large population-based 
      model. STUDY DESIGN: All pediatric gastroenterologists providing care for
      Wisconsin children voluntarily identified all new cases of IBD during a 2-year
      period. Demographic and clinical data were sent to a central registry
      prospectively for analysis. RESULTS: The incidence of IBD in Wisconsin children
      was 7.05 per 100,000, whereas the incidence for Crohn's disease was 4.56, more
      than twice the rate of ulcerative colitis (2.14). An equal IBD incidence occurred
      among all ethnic groups, and children from sparsely and densely populated
      counties were equally affected. The majority (89%) of new IBD diagnoses were
      nonfamilial. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides novel, prospective, and
      comprehensive information on pediatric IBD incidence within the United States.
      The surprisingly high incidence of pediatric IBD, the predominance of Crohn's
      disease over ulcerative colitis, the low frequency of patients with a family
      history, the equal distribution of IBD among all racial and ethnic groups, and
      the lack of a modulatory effect of urbanization on IBD incidence collectively
      suggest that the clinical spectrum of IBD is still evolving and point to
      environmental factors contributing to the pathogenesis.

TI  - Nutrition and inflammatory bowel disease: its relation to pathophysiology,
      outcome and therapy.
PG  - 220-7
AB  - Nutritional deficiencies are frequent in patients with ulcerative colitis and
      Crohn's disease, and negatively influence the outcome of the disease. Growth
      retardation, osteopenia and thromboembolic phenomena are some of the inflammatory
      bowel disease complications in which nutritional deficits are involved. Moreover,
      nutrients can play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease and, in some cases, 
      can be a primary therapeutic tool. Enteral nutrition has proven to play a
      therapeutic role in Crohn's disease. The nutrient(s) responsible for this effect 
      are not well identified but dietary fat appears to be a major factor. In
      ulcerative colitis, unabsorbable carbohydrates can modulate the intestinal
      microbial environment, thus contributing to improve colonic inflammation.

TI  - Regulation of expression of the intestinal oligopeptide transporter (Pept-1) in
      health and disease.
PG  - G779-88
AB  - The abundance of the oligopeptide transporter (Pept-1) in the brush-border
      membrane of the intestinal epithelium is the central mechanism for regulation of 
      transport of products of protein digestion (dipeptides and tripeptides) and
      peptidomimetic drugs (for example, beta-lactam antibiotics). Within the past few 
      years, there has been substantial progress in identifying the factors controlling
      this regulation and the mechanisms of their actions. The purpose of this report
      is to review this progress. The studies of individual substrates and hormones in 
      a human intestinal cell line (Caco-2) have shown that dipeptides, certain amino
      acids, insulin, and leptin increase and epidermal growth factor and
      triiodothyronine decrease the membrane population of Pept-1. In the case of
      dipeptides, epidermal growth factor, and thyroid hormone, there are parallel
      changes in the gene expression brought about by alteration of transcription
      and/or stability of Pept-1 mRNA. In contrast, the treatment with insulin and
      leptin does not induce any alteration in the Pept-1 gene expression, and the
      mechanism of increased protein expression appears to be increased trafficking
      from a preformed cytoplasmic pool to the apical membrane. In vivo studies in rats
      have shown modulation of protein and gene expressions of the intestinal
      oligopeptide transporter during the day and during development and in nutritional
      and metabolic alterations, such as high-protein diet, fasting, and diabetes.
      Patients with intestinal diseases, such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease,
      and short-bowel syndrome, may have induction of the Pept-1 expression in their
      colon. Finally, pharmacological studies have shown that the expression of Pept-1 
      can be upregulated by agents such as 5 fluorouracil and downregulated by agents
      such as cyclosporine. In conclusion, the above studies have produced a wealth of 
      new information on regulation of a key transporter in the intestine. This
      information may have useful applications in nutritional and pharmacological
      treatments, for example, in diabetic patients needing enteral nutrition or in
      ulcerative colitis patients needing the suppression of the intestinal
      inflammation.

TI  - Decreased oxidative stress in patients with ulcerative colitis supplemented with 
      fish oil omega-3 fatty acids.
PG  - 837-42
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The potential pathogenicity of free radicals may have a pivotal role
      in ulcerative colitis. Fish oil omega-3 fatty acids exert anti-inflammatory
      effects on patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), but the precise mechanism of
      the action of fish oil on oxidative stress is still controversial. The aim of the
      present work was to verify the blood oxidative stress in patients with UC and
      determine whether the association of sulfasalazine to fish oil omega-3 fatty
      acids is more effective than isolated use of sulfasalazine to reduce the
      oxidative stress. METHODS: Nine patients (seven female and two male; mean age =
      40 +/- 11 y) with mild or moderate active UC were studied in a randomized
      crossover design. In addition to their usual medication (2 g/d of sulfasalazine),
      they received fish oil omega-3 fatty acids (4.5 g/d) or placebo for 2-mo
      treatment periods that were separated by 2 mo, when they only received
      sulfasalazine. Nine healthy individuals served as control subjects to study the
      oxidative stress status. Disease activity was assessed by laboratory indicators
      (C-reactive protein, alpha1-acid glycoprotein, alpha1-antitrypsin, erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate, albumin, hemoglobin, and platelet count), sigmoidoscopy, and 
      histology scores. Analysis of oxidative stress was assessed by plasma
      chemiluminescence and erythrocyte lipid peroxidation, both induced by tert butyl 
      hydroperoxide (t-BuOOH) and by plasma malondialdehyde. Antioxidant status was
      assayed by total plasma antioxidant capacity (TRAP) and microsomal lipid
      peroxidation inhibition (LPI). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase
      erythrocyte enzymatic activities were also determined. RESULTS: No significant
      changes were observed in any laboratory indicator or in the sigmoidoscopy or
      histology scores, with the exception of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which
      decreased with both treatments. Oxidative stress was demonstrated by significant 
      decreases in TRAP and LPI levels, increased chemiluminescence induced by t-BuOOH,
      and higher SOD activity in patients with UC. Treatment with fish oil omega-3
      fatty acids reverted the chemiluminescence induced by t-BuOOH and LPI to baseline
      levels but that did not occur when patients received only sulfasalazine. Levels
      of plasma malondialdehyde, erythrocyte lipid peroxidation, and catalase were not 
      different from those in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated
      that plasma oxidative stress occurs in patients with UC, and there was a
      significant decrease when the patients used sulfasalazine plus fish oil omega-3
      fatty acids. However, there was no improvement in most laboratory indicators,
      sigmoidoscopy, and histology scores. The results suggested that omega-3 fatty
      acids may act as free radical scavengers protecting the patients against the
      overall effect of oxidative stress.

TI  - Colovaginal fistulas. Etiology and management.
PG  - 489-95
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the diagnosis and treatment of colovaginal fistulas from
      various causes. DATA SOURCES: Papers on colovaginal fistulas were identified
      using Ovid and PubMed. The search terms used were as follows: colovaginal
      fistulas, rectovaginal fistulas, diverticular disease and fistulas. METHODS OF
      STUDY: Articles were selected based on their relevance to colovaginal fistulas
      and were then further subdivided into epidemiology, etiology, presentation,
      diagnosis and management. RESULTS: English-language papers were selected based on
      their relevance to all aspects of colovaginal fistulas. CONCLUSION: Optimizing
      nutrition is paramount prior to surgery. Medical management rarely corrects the
      problem. Diverticular colovaginal fistulas arise in patients who have previously 
      undergone a hysterectomy. Radiation-related fistulas often involve the distal
      sigmoid colon and rectum, and recurrent cancer must be ruled out. Often symptoms 
      are associated with radiation cystitis and terminal ileitis. When indicated,
      restoration of intestinal continuity is preferred. Malignant fistulas carry a
      poor prognosis, and when surgical removal is not practical, they are treated
      palliatively with fecal diversion or an endoluminal stent. Those arising from
      inflammatory bowel disease most frequently arise due to Crohn's disease, and
      extirpation of diseased bowel and associated abscess will successfully treat the 
      condition. Fistulas arising from ulcerative colitis can be malignant. There
      remains a small role for colostomy as a nondefinitive procedure to alleviate
      symptoms. Colovaginal fistulas require a multidisciplinary approach and focused
      diagnostics, successful treatment can dramatically improve the patient's quality 
      of life.

TI  - Intestinal cytokines in children with pervasive developmental disorders.
PG  - 1777-82
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A relationship between autism and gastrointestinal (GI) immune
      dysregulation has been postulated based on incidence of GI complaints as well as 
      macroscopically observed lymphonodular hyperplasia and microscopically determined
      enterocolitis in pediatric patients with autism. To evaluate GI immunity, we
      quantitatively assessed levels of proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-6, 
      IL-8, and IL-1beta, produced by intestinal biopsies of children with pervasive
      developmental disorders. METHODS: Fifteen patients, six with pervasive
      developmental disorders and nine age-matched controls, presenting for diagnostic 
      colonoscopy were enrolled. Endoscopic biopsies were organ cultured, supernatants 
      were harvested, and IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1beta levels were quantified by ELISA.
      Tissue histology was evaluated by blinded pathologists. RESULTS: Concentrations
      of IL-6 from intestinal organ culture supernatants of patients with pervasive
      developmental disorders (median 318.5 pg/ml, interquartile range 282.0-393.0
      pg/ml) when compared with controls (median 436.9 pg/ml, interquartile range
      312.6-602.5 pg/ml) were not significantly different (p = 0.0987). Concentrations 
      of IL-8 (median 84,000 pg/ml, interquartile range 16,000-143,000 pg/ml) when
      compared with controls (median 177,000 pg/ml, interquartile range 114,000-244,000
      pg/ml) were not significantly different (p = 0.0707). Concentrations of IL-1beta 
      (median 0.0 pg/ml, interquartile range 0.0-94.7 pg/ml) when compared with
      controls (median 0.0 pg/ml, interquartile range 0.0-60.2 pg/ml) were not
      significantly different (p = 0.8826). Tissue histology was nonpathological for
      all patients. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated no significant difference in
      production of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1beta between patients with pervasive
      developmental disorders and age-matched controls. In general, intestinal levels
      of IL-6 and IL-8 were lower in patients with pervasive developmental disorders
      than in age-matched controls. These data fail to support an association between
      autism and GI inflammation.

TI  - Clostridium difficile toxin B is an inflammatory enterotoxin in human intestine.
PG  - 413-20
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Clostridium difficile causes antibiotic-associated diarrhea
      and pseudomembranous colitis, diseases afflicting millions of people each year.
      Although C. difficile releases 2 structurally similar exotoxins, toxin A and
      toxin B, animal experiments suggest that only toxin A mediates diarrhea and
      enterocolitis. However, toxin A-negative/toxin B-positive strains of C. difficile
      recently were isolated from patients with antibiotic-associated diarrhea and
      colitis, indicating that toxin B also may be pathogenic in humans. METHODS: Here 
      we used subcutaneously transplanted human intestinal xenografts in
      immunodeficient mice to generate a chimeric animal model for C. difficile
      toxin-induced pathology of human intestine. RESULTS: We found that intraluminal
      toxin B, like equivalent concentrations of toxin A, induced intestinal epithelial
      cell damage, increased mucosal permeability, stimulated interleukin (IL)-8
      synthesis, and caused an acute inflammatory response characterized by neutrophil 
      recruitment and tissue damage. Laser capture microdissection and real-time
      quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that
      intestinal epithelial cell-specific IL-8 gene expression also was increased
      significantly after luminal exposure to C. difficile toxins in vivo. CONCLUSIONS:
      We conclude that C. difficile toxin B, like toxin A, is a potent inflammatory
      enterotoxin for human intestine. Future therapeutic or vaccine strategies for C. 
      difficile infection therefore need to target both toxins.

TI  - Intestinal goblet cell autoantibody associated enteropathy.
PG  - 629-30
AB  - This report describes a case of refractory enteropathy with circulating
      intestinal goblet cell autoantibodies (IGA). A 19 year old man with
      hyperthyroidism had suffered from protracted diarrhoea for nearly 10 years.
      Histological examination showed evidence of collagenous enterocolitis. The
      diarrhoea did not improve despite fasting under total parenteral nutrition. An
      immunofluorescence assay demonstrated IGA without anti-enterocyte autoantibodies,
      the hallmark of autoimmune enteropathy, although other criteria were fulfilled.
      None of 109 controls, including 55 cases of inflammatory bowel disease and one of
      lymphocytic colitis, had IGA. This case is considered to be a variant of
      autoimmune enteropathy, and might be a distinct entity.

TI  - Cardiac sources of embolism should be routinely screened in ischemic colitis.
PG  - 1573-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Potential cardiac sources of embolism may promote ischemic colitis.
      The aim of this study was to evaluate their role in segmental, nongangrenous
      ischemic colitis and to determine the usefulness of routine cardiac evaluation in
      patients with this disease. METHODS: Sixty case and 60 control patients matched
      for age and gender were included and questioned regarding treatment and prior
      cardiovascular history or risk factors. Potential cardiac sources of embolism,
      classified as "proven" or " still debated," were screened using an
      electrocardiogram, rhythmic Holter monitoring over 24 h, and transthoracic
      echocardiography. RESULTS: Sex ratio (male:female) was 1:2, and mean age was 70
      +/- 14 yr. Case and control patients had similar drug use, prior cardiovascular
      history, and risk factors. A potential cardiac source of embolism was found in
      26/60 case (43%), compared with 14/60 control patients (23%) (p = 0.02; OR = 2.5,
      95% CI = 1.2-5.5). Excluding the "still debated," 21/60 case (35%), compared with
      8/60 control patients (13%), had a "proven" cardiac source of embolism (p < 0.01;
      OR = 3.5, 95% CI = 1.4-8.4). Electrocardiogram alone misdiagnosed 72% of the
      "proven" cardiac sources of embolism, whereas the combination electrocardiogram
      plus Holter monitoring detected 71%, and electrocardiogram plus echocardiography 
      62%. Twelve of 21 case patients with at least one proven cardiac source of
      embolism, were previously unknown. Anticoagulant therapy was required in 32% of
      case patients and antiarrhythmic therapy in 25% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Potential 
      cardiac sources of embolism were more common in patients with segmental,
      nongangrenous ischemic colitis than in control patients. Therefore, these
      patients should undergo a routine electrocardiogram, rhythmic Holter monitoring, 
      and transthoracic echocardiography. Anticoagulant therapy should also be
      considered for this patient population.

TI  - Body composition in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a population-based 
      study.
PG  - 1556-62
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Weight loss and nutritional depletion are common features of
      inflammatory bowel disease. Our aim was to assess body composition in patients
      with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) and to evaluate possible
      differences between the patient groups and healthy subjects. METHODS: A total of 
      60 patients with CD, 60 patients with UC, and 60 healthy subjects were
      investigated. Each group consisted of 24 men and 36 women. Body composition was
      measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry and Z scores were obtained by comparison to
      age- and sex-matched normal values. RESULTS: Bone mineral content and lean body
      mass were significantly lower in patients with CD compared with patients with UC 
      and healthy subjects. The body composition of CD men was more strongly affected
      than that of women. UC patients had significantly higher fat mass and body mass
      index than patients with CD and healthy subjects. There was no difference in the 
      percentage of fat mass between the two patient groups. Corticosteroid treatment
      and smoking had a negative impact on bone mineral content and lean body mass in
      CD patients independently of each other. CONCLUSIONS: CD was associated with
      disturbances in body composition: both bone mineral content and lean body mass
      were significantly reduced, especially in men with CD. Corticosteroid therapy and
      smoking had a significant influence on body composition in patients with CD. When
      studying the effects of inflammatory bowel disease on body composition and
      nutritional status, patients with CD and UC should be evaluated separately.

TI  - Is nutrition an aetiological factor for inflammatory bowel disease?
PG  - 607-13
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory process, the aetiology
      of which is complex and probably multi-factorial. Nutrition has been proposed to 
      be an important aetiological factor for IBD. The present review critically
      examines the relationship between components of the diet (such as sugar, fat,
      fibre, fruit and vegetables, and protein) and IBD, including ulcerative colitis
      and Crohn's disease. In addition, it investigates the possible role of infant
      feeding practices in the development of IBD.

TI  - Modulation of cytokine release from colonic explants by bacterial antigens in
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 108-14
AB  - The intestinal flora play an important role in experimental colitis and
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Using colonic explant cultures from 132 IBD and
      control subjects, we examined tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha),
      interleukin (IL)-1 and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) production in
      vitro in response to bacterial activators. Unstimulated TNF-alpha release was
      increased significantly in rectal biopsies from involved IBD tissue, correlating 
      with inflammation severity. Whereas lipopolysaccharide (LPS) only moderately
      stimulated TNF-alpha production from inflamed tissue, pokeweed mitogen (PWM)
      induced its release in all groups, with a stronger response in involved IBD
      tissue. Superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) had a similar, but weaker
      effect. SEB was observed to be the strongest inducer of TNF-alpha for all groups,
      again with a more marked response in inflamed tissue. Stimulated release of IL-1 
      was considerably less than for TNF-alpha. The superantigens' superior potency
      over LPS was not as marked for IL-1 as it was for TNF-alpha. In addition to IL-1,
      IL-1RA release was also triggered by the bacterial products. The net effect of
      activation on the IL-1RA/IL-1 ratio was relatively modest. Release of the
      proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-1, as well as that of the
      anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-1RA was increased by incubation of colonic tissue
      with bacterial factors. TNF-alpha production and release was increased
      significantly in involved colonic explants from IBD. SEB was even capable of
      inducing TNF-alpha release from uninvolved colonic tissue.

PG  - 115-24
AB  - This study was conducted to elucidate factors that influence the self-evaluation 
      of physical condition and perception of difficulties of life in ulcerative
      colitis patients. A survey and clinical examination were carried out in 171
      outpatients with ulcerative colitis. Self-evaluation of physical condition was
      assessed according to a five-grade system. Perception of difficulties of life was
      assessed using a scale developed by the authors and others. Physical condition of
      patients was assessed according to their disease state, disease symptoms, and
      nutritional state. Additional related factors such as mental condition,
      demographic attributes, and psychosocial states were also investigated. Multiple 
      regression analyses was used to assess the relationships among variables and
      showed that perception of difficulties of life and disease symptoms were the main
      explanatory factors for the self-evaluation of physical condition. Perception of 
      difficulties of life was comprised of physical and mental conditions, the latter 
      being further influenced by the patients' psychosocial state.

TI  - The state of the art in the management of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 81-92
AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), collectively known as
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), afflict an estimated one million Americans and 
      produce symptoms that impair quality of life and ability to function. Progress in
      IBD management strategies has led to optimized approaches for achieving the two
      primary clinical goals of therapy: induction and maintenance of remission.
      Although surgery is indicated to treat refractory disease or specific
      complications, pharmacotherapy is the cornerstone of IBD management. The efficacy
      of aminosalicylates for induction of remission in mild to moderate UC and CD is
      well established, as is their role for maintenance of remission in UC. The
      sulfa-free mesalamine formulation offers an adverse effect profile similar to
      that of placebo, enabling the administration of higher, more effective doses.
      Although corticosteroids provide potent anti-inflammatory effects, their benefits
      are countermanded by the risk of intolerable and serious adverse effects, and
      they are ineffective for maintenance therapy. Other agents effective in inducing 
      or maintaining remission are azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, infliximab,
      cyclosporine, methotrexate, and antibiotics. Ongoing clinical trials of
      experimental therapies will generate new tools for IBD treatment. Currently, a
      broad range of options allows physicians to tailor treatment to each patient's
      needs and preferences. Such considerations are essential for maximizing adherence
      to therapy.

TI  - Home total parenteral nutrition: an alternative to early surgery for complicated 
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 562-566
LID - 10.1016/S1091-255X(02)00132-4 [doi]
AB  - This paper examines the safety and feasibility of providing short-term, in-home
      total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for patients with inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) for whom the alternative is prolonged hospitalization or early surgery. The
      records of all patients with IBD who were receiving temporary home TPN between
      June 1996 and July 2000 were reviewed. A quality-of-life phone interview was
      conducted at the time of review. Fifteen patients (11 men and 4 women) were
      identified whose average age was 35 years. The underlying diagnosis was Crohn's
      disease in 10 and ulcerative colitis in five. The indications for home TPN were
      complex internal fistulas and resolving sepsis in two, postoperative septic
      complications (anastomotic leak/enterocutaneous fistula) in five, high-output
      proximal stomas in four, prolonged ileus/partial obstruction in three, and
      spontaneous enterocutaneous fistula in one. The average duration of home TPN was 
      75 days (range 7 to 240 days). Two patients (13%) failed home TPN (1 with
      uncontrolled sepsis; 1 with dehydration) and were readmitted to the hospital.
      Home TPN was discontinued in one patient whose enterocutaneous fistula failed to 
      heal with nonoperative treatment. Home TPN was successful in 12 patients (80%):
      eight (53%) who underwent planned definitive surgery and four (27%) whose
      conditions resolved without surgery. Complications of home TPN were line sepsis
      and pulmonary aspergillosis in one patient. All patients preferred home TPN to
      further hospitalization and reported good or excellent quality of life at home.
      Home TPN is a safe alternative to prolonged hospitalization or early surgery in
      patients with complicated IBD.

TI  - Importance of processing for physico-chemical and physiological properties of
      dietary fibre.
PG  - 187-92
AB  - There is considerable loss of DM during wet heat treatment of vegetables, leading
      to an increase in dietary fibre. Correction for the loss of DM indicates that the
      effects on total dietary fibre are minor. There is, however, depolymerization of 
      the dietary fibre polysaccharides. The degradation is related to the severity of 
      the heat treatment. Souring, freezing and mild microwave treatment have no
      effects. The viscosity is in general related to the extent of polymerisation.
      Microwave treatment has different effects on various cultivars of green beans,
      and the addition of salt (NaCl and CaCl2) to the boiling water changes the
      physico-chemical properties of soluble fibre in carrots, depending on the cation.
      The higher viscosity of the soluble fibre in raw carrots may partly explain the
      lower glucose and hormonal responses observed in healthy subjects when compared
      with blanched and microwave-cooked carrots. In studies on rats the amount of
      butyric acid in the distal colon has been shown to be higher with dietary
      components containing high amounts of resistant starch. Further, the
      fermentability is lower and the butyric acid concentration higher with composite 
      foods than with the corresponding purified fibre fractions. In human studies the 
      faecal concentration of butyric acid has been shown to increase in patients with 
      ulcerative colitis when [beta-glucan-enriched oat bran (20 g fibre) is added to
      the diet for 12 weeks. Also, an improvement of symptoms was reported.

TI  - Pharmacological nutrition in inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 57-64
AB  - Inflammatory Bowel Diseases--ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease--are chronic 
      gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases of unknown etiology. Decreased oral
      intake, malabsorption, accelerated nutrient losses, increased requirements, and
      drug-nutrient interactions cause nutritional and functional deficiencies that
      require proper correction by nutritional therapy. The goals of the different
      forms of nutritional therapy are to correct nutritional disturbances and to
      modulate inflammatory response, thus influencing disease activity. Nutritional
      intervention may improve outcome in certain individuals; however, because of the 
      costs and complications of such therapy, careful selection is warranted. Total
      parenteral nutrition has been used to correct and prevent nutritional
      disturbances and to promote bowel rest during active disease, mainly in cases of 
      digestive fistulae with a high output. Its use should be reserved for patients
      who cannot tolerate enteral nutrition. Enteral nutrition is effective in inducing
      clinical remission of disease in adults and promoting growth in children. Recent 
      research has focused on the use of specific nutrients as primary treatment
      agents. Although some reports have indicated that glutamine, short-chain fatty
      acids, antioxidants and immunonutrition with omega-3 fatty acids are an important
      therapeutic alternative in the management of inflammatory bowel diseases, the
      beneficial reported effects have yet to be translated into the clinical practice.
      The real efficacy of these nutrients still need further evaluation through
      prospective and randomized trials.

TI  - CCR4 is an up-regulated chemokine receptor of peripheral blood memory CD4+ T
      cells in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 332-8
AB  - Several chemokine receptors are expressed selectively on the surface of T cells
      depending on their polarization. The aim of this study was to characterize
      chemokine receptor expression in peripheral blood memory T cells in Crohn's
      disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), and to correlate the expression with
      disease activity. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from
      24 patients with CD, 30 patients with UC, 24 normal controls and 10 disease
      controls. PBMCs were stained by anti-CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, CXCR3, CD4, CD8, CD45RO
      and beta 7 integrin, and the expression of the chemokine receptors were
      determined by flow cytometry. CCR4 expression on memory T cells was significantly
      lower in UC than in CD or normal controls, and that of memory CD4+ T and beta
      7(high) memory CD4+ T cells was significantly higher in CD than in UC or normal
      controls. CCR4 expression on memory CD4+ T cells exhibited significant positive
      correlation with disease activity in CD, and this decreased significantly after
      treatment. Such a decrease was not found in the disease controls. CCR5 and CXCR3 
      expression on memory CD8+ T cells was significantly lower in CD than in normal
      controls. CXCR3 expression on beta 7(high) memory CD4+ T and CXCR3 expression on 
      memory CD8+ T cells were lower in UC than in normal controls. These findings
      suggest that in peripheral blood memory T cells, chemokine receptor expression is
      different between CD and UC. Enhancement of CCR4 and suppression of CCR5 and
      CXCR3 seem to be the characteristic chemokine receptor profile in peripheral
      blood memory T cells of CD.

TI  - [Surgical strategies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease].
PG  - 165-73
AB  - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are specific inflammatory bowel diseases. 
      Quality of life can be considerably limited. It does not depend on the form of
      therapy that Crohn's disease is highly recurrent, whereas colitis ulcerosa is
      curable by proctocolectomy. For both forms of disease surgery is an important
      option. It has to be included early in the therapy concept and not as last
      choice. Quality of life in patients with Crohn's disease can be raised
      significantly by surgery. Meticulous selection of the patients are essential to
      the policy of surgery as well as a regular aftercare. Best profit for those
      patients are treatment with an interdisciplinary team, consisting of
      gastroenterologists, nutrition advisers, psychologists, surgeons and
      radiologists.

TI  - Oxidative stress and ulcerative colitis-associated carcinogenesis: studies in
      humans and animal models.
PG  - 353-62
AB  - The chronic inflammatory bowel disease ulcerative colitis (UC) occurs commonly in
      the US and other Western countries, but its etiology is unknown. An association
      between UC and an elevated risk for colorectal cancer is well established.
      UC-associated colorectal carcinogenesis is probably driven by chronic
      inflammation, but the mechanism is unclear. The morphological development of
      UC-associated cancer differs from that of its sporadic counterpart. Similarly,
      detailed molecular analyses have indicated that whereas many of the genetic
      alterations observed in sporadic colon cancers also occur in UC-associated
      neoplasms, the timing and frequency of those changes in the setting of UC are
      different. These histological and molecular signatures may very well be
      reflective of an inflammation-driven carcinogenesis process in UC patients.
      Studies in animal models of UC have helped to shed light on the mechanisms of
      inflammation-driven colorectal carcinogenesis. The available evidence suggests
      that DNA damage caused by oxidative stress in the characteristic
      damage-regeneration cycle is a major contributor to colorectal cancer development
      in UC patients. Based on this concept, iron over-nutrition is proposed as a risk 
      factor and dietary antioxidants as protective factors for UC and associated
      carcinogenesis.

TI  - Gastral antral biopsy in the differentiation of pediatric colitides.
PG  - 557-61
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Differentiation of Crohn's disease (CD) from ulcerative colitis (UC) 
      is problematic, primarily when inflammation is confined to the colon. In a
      historical cohort study, we evaluated the usefulness of baseline gastric antral
      biopsies in the differentiation of pediatric chronic colitides. METHODS: During
      initial investigation for suspected inflammatory bowel disease, 39 children and
      adolescents with colitis but normal small bowel radiography underwent
      pretreatment upper endoscopy concurrently with colonoscopy. Two reviewers
      assigned a colonoscopic diagnosis (colonic CD, UC, or indeterminate colitis)
      based on the macroscopic and microscopic appearances of the colonic mucosa.
      Antral histological findings were compared between groups using Fisher's exact
      test. RESULTS: Five (14%) of colonoscopic diagnoses (four indeterminate, one UC) 
      were changed to CD by the finding of granulomatous inflammation in antral
      biopsies. Nonspecific antral gastritis was found in similar proportions of
      children and adolescents with Crohn's colitis and UC (92% vs 75%). Focal antral
      gastritis was more common in patients with Crohn's colitis than UC (52% vs 8%).
      CONCLUSIONS: Nonspecific antral gastritis is common in all forms of chronic
      colitis. Nevertheless, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with biopsy is useful in 
      the differentiation of inflammatory bowel disease confined to the colon,
      particularly when colonoscopic findings are indeterminate.

TI  - Review article: nutrition and adult inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 307-20
AB  - Major advances in the understanding of the aetio-pathogenesis and genetics of
      inflammatory bowel disease have been accompanied by an escalation in the
      sophistication of immunomodulatory inflammatory bowel disease therapeutics.
      However, the basic 'triple' therapy (5-aminosalicylates, corticosteroids,
      azathioprine) and nutrition have maintained their central role in the management 
      of patients with inflammatory bowel disease over recent decades. This review
      provides an overview of the supportive and therapeutic perspectives of nutrition 
      in adult inflammatory bowel disease. The objective of supportive nutrition is to 
      correct malnutrition in terms of calorie intake or specific macro- or
      micronutrients. Of particular clinical relevance is deficiency in calcium,
      vitamin D, folate, vitamin B12 and zinc. There is justifiably a growing sense of 
      unease amongst clinicians and patients with regard to the long-term use of
      corticosteroids in inflammatory bowel disease. This, rather than arguments about 
      efficacy, should be the catalyst for revisiting the use of enteral nutrition as
      primary treatment in Crohn's disease. Treatment failure is usually related to a
      failure to comply with enteral nutrition. Potential factors that militate against
      successful completion of enteral nutrition are feed palatability, inability to
      stay on a solid-free diet for weeks, social inconvenience and transient
      feed-related adverse reactions. Actions that can be taken to improve treatment
      outcome include the provision of good support from dietitians and clinicians for 
      the duration of treatment and the subsequent 'weaning' period. There is evidence 
      to support a gradual return to a normal diet through exclusion-re-introduction or
      other dietary regimen following the completion of enteral nutrition to increase
      remission rates. We also review the evidence for emerging therapies, such as
      glutamine, growth factors and short-chain fatty acids. The future may see the
      evolution of enteral nutrition into an important therapeutic strategy, and the
      design of a 'Crohn's disease-specific formulation' that is individually tailored,
      acceptable to patients, cost-effective, free from adverse side-effects and
      combines enteral nutrition with novel pre- and pro-biotics and other factors.

TI  - [Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) -- critical discussion of etiology,
      pathogenesis, diagnostics, and therapy].
PG  - 1-8
AB  - AIMS: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the most frequent inflammatory
      bowel diseases (IBD) with a prevalence of approximately one out of 500. Cytokine 
      research opened new and potent treatment options and thus stimulated clinical and
      basic research.However, the IBD still remain a challenge for patients and
      physicians,demanding close cooperation between gastroenterologists,radiologists
      and surgeons. The basic understanding of IBD,which is necessary for efficient
      diagnostic and therapeutic concepts is reviewed. METHODS: Based upon recent
      publications and our clinical experience we discuss aspects of
      etiology,pathogenesis,diagnostics,and therapy of Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis. RESULTS: A genetically influenced, exaggerated and sustained immune
      response against the own gut flora seems to be one of the most important factors 
      in the pathogenesis of IBD. Not less important are environmental influences. For 
      instance, cigarette smoking had been judged to have some negative influence on
      the natural course of Crohn's disease.Now,however, recent studies show that
      smoking is even a significant independent risk factor in the pathogenesis of IBD.
      Since IBD and especially Crohn's disease can effect the whole body, detailed
      analysis of inflammatory organ involvement is necessary before therapy. For
      instance, the MRI enteroclysis technique adds a necessary diagnostic tool for the
      exploration of those parts of the small bowel that cannot been reached by routine
      endoscopy like the upper ileum and the lower jejunum. In terms of therapy, a
      change of paradigms can be observed: patients will no longer be treated only when
      symptoms arise, but will early be integrated into a therapeutic concept, which is
      determined by site and extent of the disease and adapted to the abilities and
      needs of the patient.Furthermore,immunosuppressive agents like azathioprine and
      6-mercaptopurine will establish as central concept in the medical treatment of
      IBD. DISCUSSION: IBD-therapy should rather be adapted to the patient's individual
      inflammatory pattern than be oriented to schematic treatment rules. New
      endoscopic and radiologic techniques provide the necessary diagnostic tools.

TI  - Delayed puberty associated with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 205-10
AB  - Delayed puberty frequently complicates the clinical course of young patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease, more often in Crohn's disease than ulcerative
      colitis. Undernutrition has been thought to be the main reason for delayed
      puberty in these patients. However, puberty may be delayed despite a normal
      nutritional status. Observations in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and 
      in rats with experimental colitis suggest that inflammatory mediators may have a 
      direct adverse influence, independent of undernutrition, on the onset and
      progression of puberty. Serum androgens are consistently reported to be reduced
      in patients with delayed puberty and inflammatory bowel disease. This reduction
      is not necessarily secondary to a reduction in gonadotrophins as serum
      concentrations of gonadotrophins have been reported to be normal or even
      increased in some studies. Management of delayed puberty involves calorie
      supplements to correct undernutrition and treatment of inflammation. Observations
      in boys with delayed puberty and controlled studies in experimental models of
      intestinal inflammation suggest that testosterone therapy can accelerate puberty.

TI  - Infusion reactions to infliximab in children and adolescents: frequency, outcome 
      and a predictive model.
PG  - 75-84
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease commonly affects children and adolescents, however
      the majority of research into the safety and efficacy of therapies for
      inflammatory bowel disease, including infliximab, has occurred only in adults.
      AIM: To determine the rate of reactions in children following infliximab
      infusions, and to identify variables that might be predictive of those reactions.
      METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all infliximab infusions
      performed at Columbus Children's Hospital from December 1998 through September
      2001. RESULTS: Fifty-seven children received 361 infusions. Three hundred and
      fifty-five of the 361 infusions (98.3%) were completed. Fifty children had 304
      repeat infusions. There were a total of 35 infusion related reactions. Female
      gender and the use of immunosuppressive medications for less than 4 months were
      risk factors for a reaction to infusion number 2. A reaction to infusion 2 and
      immunosuppressive use for less than 4 months were risk factors for infusion
      number 3. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of infusion reactions in children receiving
      infliximab is similar to that in adults. Female gender, immunosuppressive use for
      less than 4 months and prior infusion reactions may be risk factors for
      subsequent infusion reactions in children.
