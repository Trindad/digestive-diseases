TI  - [Hormonal changes in inflammatory bowel disease].
PG  - 5S35-9
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease is often accompanied by extraintestinal manifestations
      due to a common autoimmune etiopathogenesis, chronic systemic inflammation,
      frequent nutrition deficits, and the treatment. Endocrine system changes belong
      to manifestations too. Interaction is mutual, Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis cause functional and morphological changes of endocrine tissues. On the
      other hand the endocrine disorders negatively influence the course of bowel
      disease. In the article we analyze correlation of IBD with gonadal hormone
      production and fertility, with adrenal function, with the function and morphology
      of the thyroid, with growth hormone production and growth disorders in children, 
      and with bone mineral density reduction. This topic is not studied enough and
      needs more analysis and clarification.

TI  - Up regulation of glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR) is
      associated with intestinal epithelial cells apoptosis in TNBS-induced
      experimental colitis.

AB  - Glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR), which exists mainly in
      the liver, is a D-2-hydroxy-acid dehydrogenase that plays a critical role in the 
      formation of primary hyperoxaluria type 2 (PH2). Here, we investigated GRHPR
      expression and its potential role in both human Crohn's disease (CD) and
      experimental colitis. Murine experimental colitis models were established by
      administration of trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS). As shown by Western blot,
      significant up-regulation of GRHPR was found in TNBS-treated mice as compared
      with normal controls. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) also showed increased GRHPR
      expression, and the molecule was located in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs).
      This phenomenon also occurred in patients with Crohn's disease. Besides, in an in
      vitro study, human IEC line HT-29 cells cultured with tumor necrosis factor alpha
      (TNF-alpha) were used to evaluate the changes in expression of GRHPR. Moreover,
      overexpression of GRHPR was accompanied by active caspase-3 and cleaved poly
      ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) accumulation. Furthermore, knock-down GRHPR could
      inhibit the accumulation of active caspase-3 and cleaved PARP as shown by Western
      blot in TNF-alpha treated HT-29 cells. Flow cytometry assay indicated that
      interference of GRHPR led to increasing apoptosis of IECs. These data suggested
      that GRHPR might exert its pro-apoptosis function in IECs. Thus, GRHPR might play
      an important role in regulating IECs apoptosis, and might be a potential
      therapeutic target for CD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Infliximab is used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.
      Previously reported neurological complications include central and peripheral
      demyelinating disorders and neuropathies occurring months into therapy. PATIENT
      DESCRIPTION: A seven-year-old boy diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and primary
      sclerosing cholangitis received infliximab. Six hours following his uneventful
      infusion, he awoke with headache and emesis and rapidly became obtunded.
      Neurological examination revealed minimally reactive pupils and otherwise absent 
      brainstem reflexes. Cranial computed tomography revealed hypodense lesions in the
      cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, and pons accompanied by hemorrhage. Magnetic
      resonance imaging showed diffusion restriction concerning for ischemia with areas
      of ring enhancement suggestive of inflammation. Vessel imaging was normal, and
      cerebrospinal fluid and serum studies showed only an extremely elevated level of 
      d-dimer. Echocardiogram showed depressed ventricular function but neither
      intracardiac shunt nor thrombus. Within four days he met criteria for brain
      death. Autopsy was refused. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a fulminant,
      fatal central nervous system process to occur after an initial dose of
      infliximab. The differential diagnosis includes multifocal arterial strokes and a
      devastating demyelinating process.

PG  - 389-92
AB  - In the recent decades the rapid development of the studies on new methods used in
      diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and monitoring the treatment of inflammatory
      bowel diseases has been observed. To the diagnostics of gastrointestinal
      disorders new methods such as endoscopic capsule and imaging methods including
      magnetic resonance have been introduced. Markers of inflammation detected in
      stool play significant role in the diagnostics. To the best known belong
      calprotectine and lactoferrin, which are produced by neutral granulocytes. In the
      present review we have presented the clinical usefulness of detection in the
      stool of calprotectin, lectoferrin, S100A12 protein and pyruvate kinase. Clinical
      usefulness of these markers were used in diagnosis, assessment of the treatment
      results, disease relapse and mucosal healing in inflammatory bowel disease.
      Determination of fecal calprotectin and lactoferrin in the process of mucosal
      healing in ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease are of particular value.
      Confirmation of these results in multicenter prospective trials will enable in
      the future to reduce the number of control colonoscopies, which in children are
      performer under general anesthesia.

AB  - The hydroxycarboxylic acid receptors (HCA1-3) are a family of G-protein-coupled
      receptors that are critical for sensing endogenous intermediates of metabolism.
      All three receptors are predominantly expressed on adipocytes and mediate
      anti-lipolytic effects. In addition to adipocytes, HCA2 is highly expressed on
      immune cells, including macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils and dermal dendritic 
      cells, among other cell types. The endogenous ligand for HCA2 is
      beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB), a ketone body produced by the liver through
      beta-oxidation when an individual is in a negative energy balance. Recent studies
      demonstrate that HCA2 mediates profound anti-inflammatory effects in a variety of
      tissues, indicating that HCA2 may be an important therapeutic target for treating
      inflammatory disease processes. This review summarizes the roles of HCA2 on
      inflammation in a number of tissues and clinical states.

PG  - 815-22
LID - 10.17219/acem/26003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Children constitute 20% of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases 
      (IBD). Still there is a search for a perfect marker for this group of patients
      which would help in the diagnosis of the disease, in determinating its activity
      and in monitoring the treatment. OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the usefulness of the
      application of calprotectin measurement in stool samples from children with IBD, 
      as a marker of the severity of inflammation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analysed
      156 patients: 58 with ulcerative colitis (UC), 67 with Crohn's disease (CD), and 
      31 from the control group. In all patients the concentration of calprotectin in
      the sample of feces, markers of inflammation and hemoglobin were measured.
      RESULTS: Concentration of calprotectin in feces of patients with IBD was above
      the normal range in all patients with moderate and severe disease and in the
      majority with mild disease or in remission, but it was normal in all patients
      from the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated concentration of fecal calprotectin
      (FC) was observed in the majority of patients with IBD, but in none from the
      control group. The number of patients with elevated FC concentration increased
      together with the disease activity. FC concentration was higher in patients with 
      severe and moderate disease activity. FC concentration in patients with IBD was
      associated with the increase of inflammatory markers and decreased haemoglobin.
      Percentage of laboratory abnormalities in children with Crohn's disease and
      perianal changes was higher. FC concentration can be a noninvasive marker of
      disease activity in IBD.

TI  - Switching Between Infliximab Originator and Biosimilar in Paediatric Patients
      with Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Preliminary Observations.
PG  - 127-32
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv233 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The growing incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in
      children necessitates the use of biological treatments. Recently, an infliximab
      biosimilar was authorized in the European Union, which may result in switching
      patients. We present our preliminary experiences with such switches. METHODS: The
      prospective study included 32 paediatric patients diagnosed with Crohn's disease 
      (CD) and 7 children with ulcerative colitis (UC) at 3 academic hospitals, who
      were switched from infliximab originator to its biosimilar (Remsima). Patient
      characteristics, disease severity, laboratory parameters and adverse events were 
      recorded. Means, medians and ranges were calculated. RESULTS: Mean age at
      diagnosis of CD and UC was 11.1 (2.7-15.3) and 12.3 years (8.5-14.8),
      respectively. Mean number of infliximab originator infusions before switching to 
      the biosimilar was 9.9 (median 8, range 4-29) and 5.1 (5, 1-12) for the CD and UC
      group, respectively. Evaluation efficacy of last biosimilar doses of all patients
      revealed rates of clinical remission of 88 and 57% for CD and UC patients,
      respectively. Last follow-up assessment of patients who continued with biosimilar
      therapy showed that 16/20 (80%) CD patients and all 4 UC individuals were in
      remission. One infusion reaction to infliximab biosimilar was observed in a CD
      patient, which led to treatment discontinuation. The incidence of sporadic mild
      adverse events prior to and after switching did not differ significantly and was 
      consistent with the safety profile of the infliximab molecule. CONCLUSION:
      Switching from infliximab originator to its biosimilar seems to be a safe option 
      in children with CD. After the switch the biosimilar was just as effective as the
      originator.

TI  - Eldelumab [Anti-IP-10] Induction Therapy for Ulcerative Colitis: A Randomised,
      Placebo-Controlled, Phase 2b Study.
PG  - 418-28
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv224 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10 [IP-10] mediates
      immune cell trafficking from the circulation to the inflamed colon and decreases 
      gut epithelial cell survival. IP-10 expression is increased in patients with
      ulcerative colitis [UC]. We report efficacy and safety results from a
      dose-ranging induction study of eldelumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to
      IP-10, in moderately to severely active UC. METHODS: A total of 252 adults with
      UC [Mayo score >/= 6 and endoscopic subscore >/= 2] were randomised 1:1:1 to
      placebo or eldelumab 15 or 25 mg/kg administered intravenously on Days 1 and 8
      and every other week thereafter. The primary endpoint was clinical remission
      [Mayo score </= 2; no individual subscale score > 1] at Week 11. Key secondary
      endpoints included Mayo score clinical response and mucosal healing at Week 11.
      RESULTS: Neither eldelumab 15 or 25 mg/kg resulted in significant increases vs
      placebo in the proportion of patients achieving Week 11 clinical remission.
      Remission and response rates were 17.6% and 47.1% with eldelumab 25mg/kg, 13.1%
      and 44.0% with eldelumab 15mg/kg, and 9.6% and 31.3% with placebo. Clinical
      remission and response rates were higher in anti-tumour necrosis factor
      [TNF]-naive patients treated with eldelumab compared with placebo. Eldelumab
      treatment was well tolerated and no immunogenicity was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The
      primary endpoint was not achieved with induction treatment with eldelumab 15 or
      25 mg/kg in patients with UC. Trends towards clinical remission and response were
      observed in the overall population and were more pronounced in anti-TNF naive
      patients. Eldelumab safety signals were consistent with those reported previously
      [ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01294410].

TI  - The Influence of Ghrelin on the Development of Dextran Sodium Sulfate-Induced
      Colitis in Rats.
PG  - 718314
LID - 10.1155/2015/718314 [doi]
AB  - Ghrelin has protective and therapeutic effects in the gut. The aim of present
      studies was to investigate the effect of treatment with ghrelin on the
      development of colitis evoked by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Methods. Studies
      have been performed on rats. Colitis was induced by adding 5% DSS to the drinking
      water for 5 days. During this period animals were treated intraperitoneally twice
      a day with saline or ghrelin given at the dose of 8 nmol/kg/dose. On the sixth
      day, animals were anesthetized and the severity of colitis was assessed. Results.
      Treatment with ghrelin during administration of DSS reduced the development of
      colitis. Morphological features of colonic mucosa exhibited a reduction in the
      area and deep of mucosal damage. Ghrelin reversed the colitis-induced decrease in
      blood flow, DNA synthesis, and superoxide dismutase activity in colonic mucosa.
      These effects were accompanied by a decrease in the colitis-evoked increase in
      mucosal concentration of interleukin-1beta and malondialdehyde. Treatment with
      ghrelin reversed the DSS-induced reduction in body weight gain. Conclusions.
      Administration of ghrelin exhibits the preventive effect against the development 
      of DSS-induced colitis. This effect seems to be related to ghrelin's
      anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties.

LID - S1084-9521(15)30027-6 [pii]
AB  - The gastrointestinal (GI) tract must balance the extraction of energy and
      metabolic end-products from ingested nutrition and resident gut microbes and the 
      maintenance of a symbiotic relationship with this microbiota, with the ability to
      mount functional immune responses to pathogenic organisms to maintain GI health. 
      The gut epithelium is equipped with bacteria-sensing mechanisms that discriminate
      between pathogenic and commensal microorganisms and regulate host responses
      between immunity and tolerance. The epithelium also expresses numerous
      nutrient-sensing receptors, but their importance in the preservation of the gut
      microbiota and immune homeostasis remains largely unexplored. Observations that a
      deficiency in the extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) using intestinal 
      epithelium-specific receptor knockout mice resulted in diminished intestinal
      barrier integrity, altered composition of the gut microbiota, modified expression
      of intestinal pattern recognition receptors, and a skewing of local and systemic 
      innate responses from regulatory to stimulatory, may change the way that this
      receptor is considered as a potential immunotherapeutic target in gut
      homeostasis. These findings suggest that pharmacologic CaSR activators and
      CaSR-based nutrients such as calcium, polyamines, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and 
      oligo-peptides might be useful in conditioning the gut microenvironment, and
      thus, in the prevention and treatment of disorders such as inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD), infectious enterocolitis, and other inflammatory and secretory
      diarrheal diseases. Here, we review the emerging roles of the CaSR in intestinal 
      homeostasis and its therapeutic potential for gut pathology.

TI  - Incidence Trends and Geographical Variability of Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel
      Disease in Slovenia: A Nationwide Study.
PG  - 921730
LID - 10.1155/2015/921730 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aims of the study were to determine the incidence rate of
      pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD) and its trends for the period of
      2002-2010 and to assess the geographical distribution of PIBD in Slovenia.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records of patients (0-18 years) with newly
      diagnosed IBD during the study period were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: The
      mean incidence rate for IBD in 2002-2010 was 7.6 per 100,000 children and
      adolescents per year, 4.5 for Crohn's disease (CD), 2.9 for ulcerative colitis
      (UC), and 0.2 for IBD-unclassified, respectively. The incidence rate increased
      from 5.8 per 100,000 per year in 2002-2004 to 8.6 in 2005-2007 and remained
      stable afterwards. Statistically significant difference in the incidence rate
      between the Northeastern and Southwestern parts of the country was observed (p = 
      0.025). CONCLUSION: This nationwide study demonstrates that Slovenia is among the
      European countries with the highest PIBD incidence. During the study period a
      substantial rise of PIBD incidence was observed during the first half of the
      study and it seems to have stabilized in the second half. The significant
      difference in PIBD incidence between Northeastern and Southwestern parts of the
      country merits further exploration of the possible environmental factors.

AB  - We here report the case of a 30-year old man with a history of ulcerative
      colitis, who presented clinical and biological features compatible with a viral
      hepatitis. Initial serological results revealed the presence of IgM antibodies
      against many viruses, and the most likely diagnosis was viral hepatitis A.
      However, further investigations were performed and concluded to cytomegalovirus
      primary infection.

TI  - Ganglioside Intake Increases Plasma Ganglioside Content in Human Participants.
PG  - 657-666
LID - 10.1177/0148607115620093 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies reveal associations between intestinal
      ganglioside content and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Since a low level of
      ganglioside is associated with higher production of proinflammatory signals in
      the intestine, it is important to determine safety and bioavailability of dietary
      ganglioside for application as a potential therapeutic agent. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Healthy volunteers (HVs; n = 18) completed an 8-week supplementation
      study to demonstrate safety and bioavailabity of ganglioside consumption. HVs
      were randomized to consume a milk fat fraction containing 43 mg/d ganglioside or 
      placebo, and patients with IBD (n = 5) consumed ganglioside supplement in a small
      pilot study. Plasma gangliosides were characterized using reverse-phase liquid
      chromatography-QQQ mass spectrometry. Intestinal permeability was assessed by
      oral lactulose/mannitol, and quality of life was assessed by quality of life in
      the IBD questionnaire. RESULTS: There were no adverse events associated with
      dietary ganglioside intake. Ganglioside consumption increased ( P < .05) plasma
      content of total GD3 by 35% over 8 weeks. HVs consuming ganglioside exhibited a
      19% decrease in intestinal permeability ( P = .04). Consumption of ganglioside
      was associated with a 39% increase ( P < .01) in emotional health and a 36%
      improvement ( P < .02) in systemic symptoms in patients with IBD. CONCLUSION:
      Impaired intestinal integrity characteristic of IBD results in increased
      permeability to bacterial antigens and decreased nutrient absorption. Intestinal 
      integrity may be improved by dietary treatment with specific species of
      ganglioside. Ganglioside is a safe, bioavailable dietary compound that can be
      consumed to potentially improve quality of life in patients with IBD and treat
      other disorders involving altered ganglioside metabolism. This study was
      registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02139709.

TI  - Diagnostic Yield of Routine Enteropathogenic Stool Tests in Pediatric Ulcerative 
      Colitis.
PG  - 639-42
AB  - GOALS: It can be important to exclude infectious etiologies prior to adjusting
      immunosuppressive therapy in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) exacerbation. 
      We sought to determine the diagnostic yield of routine infectious stool studies
      in pediatric UC patients. PROCEDURES: We conducted a retrospective review of 152 
      pediatric UC patients at Texas Children's Hospital between January 2003 and
      December 2009. The patient records were followed through July 2014. The number
      and type of infectious stool studies performed and the results of those were
      collected. RESULTS: Three hundred fifty-four diagnostic stool tests were
      conducted for Clostridium difficile; 13.6% were positive. Two hundred twenty
      stool bacterial cultures were performed, and 1.8% were positive, all growing
      non-typhoid Salmonella. One of 13 (7.7%) Adenovirus PCR tests was positive. Two
      of 152 examinations (1.3%) for Ova and Parasites were positive. No stool tests
      for viral culture, viral particles, Yersinia or Rotavirus were positive.
      CONCLUSIONS: Clostridium difficile infection is common in pediatric UC, and
      routine screening during flares is strongly recommended. Other bacterial and
      parasitic infections routinely tested for are uncommon, but Salmonella may be a
      potentially important attribute to disease exacerbations in select patients. In
      patients without co-morbid conditions, the utility of performing non-specific
      fecal viral tests is questionable.

TI  - Mucosal Barrier Depletion and Loss of Bacterial Diversity are Primary
      Abnormalities in Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis.
PG  - 462-71
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv223 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ulcerative colitis [UC] is associated with colonic mucosa
      barrier defects and bacterial dysbiosis, but these features may simply be the
      result of inflammation. Therefore, we sought to assess whether these features are
      inherently abrogated in the terminal ileum [TI] of UC patients, where
      inflammation is absent. METHODS: TI biopsies from paediatric inflammatory bowel
      disease [IBD] subsets [Crohn's disease [CD; n = 13] and UC [n = 10]], and non-IBD
      disease controls [n = 12] were histologically graded, and alcian blue/periodic
      acid-Schiff stained biopsies were quantified. The mucosal barrier was assessed
      for mucin [MUC2], immunoglobulin [Ig]A, IgG, and total bacteria (fluorescence
      in-situ hybridisation [FISH probe EUB338]) by immunofluorescence. The regulation 
      of mucin secretion was investigated by NLRP6 gene expression and
      immunofluorescence. The composition of the active mucosa-associated microbiota
      was explored by sequencing the 16S rRNA amplicon generated from total RNA.
      RESULTS: Despite the absence of ileitis, UC patients displayed ileal barrier
      depletion illustrated by reductions in mucin-containing goblet cells and mucin
      production and altered epithelial NLRP6 expression. In both CD patients with
      ileitis and UC patients with normal histology, bacteria coated with IgA and IgG
      penetrated the TI mucin layer. Biopsy 16S rRNA sequencing revealed a reduction in
      alpha-diversity by three methods [Shannon, Simpson, and Equitability indices]
      between UC and non-IBD paediatric patients. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest
      an underlying defect in the UC-afflicted intestinal tract even in the absence of 
      inflammation, implicating barrier and microbial changes as primary abnormalities 
      in UC that may play a causative role in disease development.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Despite dietary factors being implicated in the pathogenesis of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), nutritional therapy, outside of exclusive
      enteral nutrition (EEN), has not had a defined role within the treatment paradigm
      of pediatric IBD within IBD centers. Based on emerging data, Seattle Children's
      Hospital IBD Center has developed an integrated dietary program incorporating the
      specific carbohydrate diet (SCD) into its treatment paradigm. This treatment
      paradigm uses the SCD as primary therapy as well as adjunctive therapy for the
      treatment of IBD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential effects of 
      the SCD on clinical outcomes and laboratory studies of pediatric patients with
      Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: In this retrospective 
      study, we reviewed the medical records of patients with IBD on SCD. RESULTS: We
      analyzed 26 children on the SCD: 20 with CD and 6 with UC. Duration of the
      dietary therapy ranged from 3 to 48 mo. In patients with active CD (Pediatric
      Crohn's Disease activity index [PCDAI] >10), PCDAI dropped from 32.8 +/- 13.2 at 
      baseline to 20.8 +/- 16.6 by 4 +/- 2 wk, and to 8.8 +/- 8.5 by 6 mo. The mean
      Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index for patients with active UC decreased
      from a baseline of 28.3 +/- 10.3 to 20.0 +/- 17.3 at 4 +/- 2 wk, to 18.3 +/- 31.7
      at 6 mo. CONCLUSION: This retrospective review provides evidence that the SCD can
      be integrated into a tertiary care center and may improve clinical and laboratory
      parameters for pediatric patients with nonstructuring, nonpenetrating CD as well 
      as UC. Further prospective studies are needed to fully assess the safety and
      efficacy of the SCD in pediatric patients with IBD.

      Systematic Review.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of enteral nutrition (EN) for maintaining remission in
      patients with inactive Crohn's disease (CD) is unclear. The aim of this article
      was to systematically identify, review, and critically appraise the evidence on
      efficacy of EN in maintaining medically induced remission in CD. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Several databases were searched from inception to April 2015 for
      relevant citations of published randomized controlled trials and nonrandomized
      cohort studies. Two reviewers independently selected studies for inclusion and
      assessed study quality and risk of bias. The primary outcome was relapse rate in 
      patients with inactive CD who have been in medically induced remission and
      subsequently started or maintained on EN. RESULTS: Twelve studies (1169 patients,
      including 95 children) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. As the included studies 
      were significantly heterogeneous, a meta-analysis was not performed. Eleven
      studies showed that EN was either better than, or as effective as, the comparator
      in maintaining remission in patients with inactive CD. No major EN-related
      adverse events were reported. Only 1 adult randomized controlled trial (n = 51), 
      with low risk of bias, compared EN with regular diet and found a relapse rate of 
      34% in the EN group versus 64% in the control group ( P < .01) after a mean
      follow-up of 11.9 months. CONCLUSIONS: EN is more effective than regular diet and
      as effective as some medications in maintaining remission for patients with
      inactive CD. Large, properly designed randomized controlled studies of sufficient
      duration are required to confirm this conclusion for EN versus individual
      medications.

AB  - The management of patients with moderate to severe inflammatory bowel diseases,
      that is, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, remains challenging. In recent
      years, therapeutic goal evolved from clinical remission to mucosal healing and
      deep remission. In order to achieve remission, it is important to appropriately
      choose and use available drugs. Therefore, anti-TNFalpha treatment should be
      rapidly used for severe and at-risk patients, sometimes in association with
      thiopurines or methotrexate. The monitoring of through levels and antibodies to
      anti-TNFalpha is relevant to optimize the treatment and to reduce drug
      inefficacy. However, the development of new drugs is required to offer
      alternative tools to severe and refractory patients.

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of Tacrolimus Therapy for Active Ulcerative Colitis; A
      Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
PG  - 484-94
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv221 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 25% of patients with ulcerative colitis [UC] experience
      a severe flare requiring steroid therapy to avoid colectomy. We performed a
      systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of tacrolimus as a
      rescue therapy for active UC. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for
      relevant studies assessing the efficacy of tacrolimus for active UC. Outcomes
      included short- and long-term clinical response, colectomy free rates, and rate
      of adverse events in randomised controlled trials [RCTs] and observational
      studies. RESULTS: Two RCTs comparing high trough concentration [10-15ng/ml]
      versus placebo [n = 103] and 23 observational studies [n = 831] were identified. 
      Clinical response at 2 weeks was significantly higher with tacrolimus compared
      with placebo (risk ratio [RR] = 4.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.09-10.17, 
      p = 0.15 x 10(-3)] among RCTs. Rates of clinical response at 1 and 3 months were 
      0.73 [95% CI = 0.64-0.81] and 0.76 [95% CI = 0.59-0.87], and colectomy-free rates
      remained high at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months [0.86, 0.84, 0.78, and 0.69,
      respectively] among observational studies. Among RCTs, adverse events were more
      frequent compared with placebo [RR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.20-3.37, p = 0.83 x
      10(-2)], but there was no difference in severe adverse events [RR = 3.15, 95% CI 
      = 0.14-72.9, p = 0.47]. Severe adverse events were rare among observational
      studies [0.11, 95% CI = 0.06-0.20]. CONCLUSIONS: In the present meta-analysis,
      tacrolimus was associated with high clinical response and colectomy-free rates
      without increased risk of severe adverse events for active UC.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Parenteral methotrexate is an effective treatment for patients
      with Crohn's disease, but has never been adequately evaluated in patients with
      ulcerative colitis (UC). We conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine 
      its safety and efficacy in patients with steroid-dependent UC. METHODS: We
      performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of
      parenteral methotrexate (25 mg/wk) in 111 patients with corticosteroid-dependent 
      UC at 26 medical centers in Europe from 2007 through 2013. Patients were given
      prednisone (10 to 40 mg/d) when the study began and were randomly assigned to
      groups (1:1) given placebo or methotrexate (intramuscularly or subcutaneously, 25
      mg weekly) for 24 weeks. The primary end point was steroid-free remission
      (defined as a Mayo score </=2 with no item >1 and complete withdrawal of
      steroids) at week 16. Secondary endpoints included clinical remission (defined as
      a Mayo clinical subscore </=2 with no item >1) and endoscopic healing without
      steroids at weeks 16 and/or 24, remission without steroids at week 24, and
      remission at both weeks 16 and 24. RESULTS: Steroid-free remission at week 16 was
      achieved by 19 of 60 patients given methotrexate (31.7%) and 10 of 51 patients
      given placebo (19.6%)--a difference of 12.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -4.0%
      to 28.1%; P = .15). The proportion of patients in steroid-free clinical remission
      at week 16 was 41.7% in the methotrexate group and 23.5% in the placebo group,
      for a difference of 18.1% (95% CI: 1.1% to 35.2%; P = .04). The proportions of
      patients with steroid-free endoscopic healing at week 16 were 35% in the
      methotrexate group and 25.5% in the placebo group--a difference of 9.5% (95% CI: 
      -7.5% to 26.5%; P = .28). No differences were observed in other secondary end
      points. More patients receiving placebo discontinued the study because of adverse
      events (47.1%), mostly caused by UC, than patients receiving methotrexate (26.7%;
      P = .03). A higher proportion of patients in the methotrexate group had nausea
      and vomiting (21.7%) than in the placebo group (3.9%; P = .006). CONCLUSIONS: In 
      a randomized controlled trial, parenteral methotrexate was not superior to
      placebo for induction of steroid-free remission in patients with UC. However,
      methotrexate induced clinical remission without steroids in a significantly
      larger percentage of patients, resulting in fewer withdrawals from therapy due to
      active UC. ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT00498589.

TI  - Exercise and gut immune function: evidence of alterations in colon immune cell
      homeostasis and microbiome characteristics with exercise training.
PG  - 158-63
LID - 10.1038/icb.2015.108 [doi]
AB  - There is robust evidence that habitual physical activity is anti-inflammatory and
      protective against developing chronic inflammatory disease. Much less is known
      about the effects of habitual moderate exercise in the gut, the compartment that 
      has the greatest immunological responsibility and interactions with the
      intestinal microbiota. The link between the two has become evident, as recent
      studies have linked intestinal dysbiosis, or the disproportionate balance of
      beneficial to pathogenic microbes, with increased inflammatory disease
      susceptibility. Limited animal and human research findings imply that exercise
      may have a beneficial role in preventing and ameliorating such diseases by having
      an effect on gut immune function and, recently, microbiome characteristics.
      Emerging data from our laboratory show that different forms of exercise training 
      differentially impact the severity of intestinal inflammation during an
      inflammatory insult (for example, ulcerative colitis) and may be jointly related 
      to gut immune cell homeostasis and microbiota-immune interactions. The evidence
      we review and present will provide data in support of rigorous investigations
      concerning the effects of habitual exercise on gut health and disease.

TI  - The aged gut in inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 235-47
AB  - Senescence is accompanied by various anatomical and functional alterations
      starting from mastication and deglutition and consequent modifications of
      nutrition. In addition, the widespread use of proton pump inhibitors and
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aged subjects weakens the gastric
      barrier, thus contributing to easier entry of microbes into the gastrointestinal 
      tract. The microbiota of the elderly is less stable than that of younger adults, 
      therefore, gut dysbiosis is more frequent. Dysbiosis represents a key factor for 
      infections, e.g. Clostridium difficile, especially after antibiotic treatment,
      but also represents an important step for the development of inflammatory bowel
      diseases (IBD). IBD onset in the elderly needs careful evaluation in order to
      distinguish this entity from other pathologies that may affect the gut in
      senescence. Colitis associated with diverticula, drug-induced, ischemic, and
      microscopic colitides are among the possible diseases and, therefore, a careful
      macroscopic and histologic evaluation is mandatory. Finally, late onset IBD
      represents an important challenge for physicians since it occurs in subjects with
      frequent comorbidities and relative concomitant treatments. Although there is
      some evidence that disease course of elderly-onset IBD follows a milder course,
      overall morbidity, hospitalization rates and even mortality, the latter mostly
      due to comorbidities, are increased, especially in emergency settings.

AB  - Ideally, surgical patients should be nutritionally optimized, as better
      nutritional status correlates with favorable outcomes during the perioperative
      period. As inflammatory bowel disease often leads to overall malnutrition,
      special consideration should be given to this patient population by surgeons. In 
      this article, we review methods for nutritional assessment and provide
      nutritional recommendations for this special surgical population.

TI  - Fungal Dysbiosis in Mucosa-associated Microbiota of Crohn's Disease Patients.
PG  - 296-305
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv209 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Gut microbiota is involved in many physiological functions
      and its imbalance is associated with several diseases, particularly with
      inflammatory bowel diseases. Mucosa-associated microbiota could have a key role
      in induction of host immunity and in inflammatory process. Although the role of
      fungi has been suggested in inflammatory disease pathogenesis, the fungal
      microbiota has not yet been deeply explored. Here we analysed the bacterial and
      fungal composition of the mucosa-associated microbiota of Crohn's disease
      patients and healthy subjects. METHODS: Our prospective, observational study
      evaluated bacterial and fungal composition of mucosa-associated microbiota of 23 
      Crohn's disease patients [16 in flare, 7 in remission] and 10 healthy subjects,
      using 16S [MiSeq] and ITS2 [pyrosequencing] sequencing, respectively. Global
      fungal load was assessed by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
      RESULTS: Bacterial microbiota in Crohn's disease patients was characterised by a 
      restriction in biodiversity. with an increase of Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria.
      Global fungus load was significantly increased in Crohn's disease flare compared 
      with healthy subjects [p < 0.05]. In both groups, the colonic mucosa-associated
      fungal microbiota was dominated by Basidiomycota and Ascomycota phyla.
      Cystofilobasidiaceae family and Candida glabrata species were overrepresented in 
      Crohn's disease. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Filobasidium uniguttulatum species 
      were associated with non-inflamed mucosa, whereas Xylariales order was associated
      with inflamed mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the alteration of the
      bacterial microbiota and is the first demonstration of the existence of an
      altered fungal microbiota in Crohn's disease patients, suggesting that fungi may 
      play a role in pathogenesis.

TI  - mTORC1 signaling and IL-17 expression: Defining pathways and possible therapeutic
      targets.
PG  - 291-9
LID - 10.1002/eji.201545886 [doi]
AB  - IL-17 mediates immune responses against extracellular pathogens, and it is
      associated with the development and pathogenesis of various autoimmune diseases. 
      The expression of IL-17 is regulated by various intracellular signaling cascades.
      Recently, it has been shown that mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)
      signaling, comprised mainly of mTORC1 signaling, plays a critical role in IL-17
      expression. Here, we review the current knowledge regarding mechanisms by which
      mTORC1 regulates IL-17 expression. mTORC1 positively modulates IL-17 expression
      through several pathways, i.e. STAT3, -HIF-1alpha, -S6K1, and -S6K2. Amino acids 
      (AAs) also regulate IL-17 expression by being the energy source for Th17 cells,
      and by activating mTORC1 signaling. Altogether, the AA-mTORC1-IL-17 axis has
      broad therapeutic implications for IL-17-associated diseases, such as EAE,
      allergies, and colitis.

TI  - IRE1alpha is an endogenous substrate of endoplasmic-reticulum-associated
      degradation.
PG  - 1546-55
LID - 10.1038/ncb3266 [doi]
AB  - Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) represents a principle
      quality control mechanism to clear misfolded proteins in the ER; however, its
      physiological significance and the nature of endogenous ERAD substrates remain
      largely unexplored. Here we discover that IRE1alpha, the sensor of the unfolded
      protein response (UPR), is a bona fide substrate of the Sel1L-Hrd1 ERAD complex. 
      ERAD-mediated IRE1alpha degradation occurs under basal conditions in a
      BiP-dependent manner, requires both the intramembrane hydrophilic residues of
      IRE1alpha and the lectin protein OS9, and is attenuated by ER stress. ERAD
      deficiency causes IRE1alpha protein stabilization, accumulation and mild
      activation both in vitro and in vivo. Although enterocyte-specific Sel1L-knockout
      mice (Sel1L(DeltaIEC)) are viable and seem normal, they are highly susceptible to
      experimental colitis and inflammation-associated dysbiosis, in an
      IRE1alpha-dependent but CHOP-independent manner. Hence, Sel1L-Hrd1 ERAD serves a 
      distinct, essential function in restraint of IRE1alpha signalling in vivo by
      managing its protein turnover.

AB  - Probiotics are foods or products that contain live microorganisms that benefit
      the host when administered. In this clinical review, we evaluate the literature
      associated with using probiotics in common pediatric gastrointestinal disorders, 
      focusing specifically on antibiotic-associated diarrhea, acute gastroenteritis,
      Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), colic, inflammatory bowel disease, and
      functional gastrointestinal diseases. Meta-analysis of several randomized
      controlled trials have confirmed benefit for the administration of Lactobacillus 
      rhamnosus GG and Saccharomyces boulardii to prevent antibiotic-associated
      diarrhea and to treat acute infectious diarrhea. Individual studies have also
      suggested benefit of probiotics to prevent acute gastroenteritis and serve as an 
      adjunct in ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, CDI,
      functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, and colic in breastfed
      babies. Although promising, larger well-designed studies need to confirm these
      findings. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend probiotics for
      the treatment of constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome or Crohn's
      disease.

TI  - Interleukin-6 stimulates aerobic glycolysis by regulating PFKFB3 at early stage
      of colorectal cancer.
PG  - 215-24
LID - 10.3892/ijo.2015.3225 [doi]
AB  - Chronic inflammation is a well-known etiological factor for colorectal cancer
      (CRC) and cancer cells are known to preferentially metabolize glucose through
      aerobic glycolysis. However, the connection between chronic inflammation and
      aerobic glycolysis in the development of CRC is largely unexplored. The present
      study investigated whether interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pro-inflammatory cytokine,
      promotes the development of CRC by regulating the aerobic glycolysis and the
      underlying molecular mechanisms. In colitis-associated CRC mouse, anti-IL-6
      receptor antibody treatment reduced the incidence of CRC and decreased the
      expression of key genes in aerobic glycolysis, whereas the plasma concentrations 
      of glucose and lactate were not affected. Consistently, IL-6 treatment stimulated
      aerobic glycolysis, upregulated key genes in aerobic glycolysis and promoted cell
      proliferation and migration in SW480 and SW1116 CRC cells.
      6-phoshofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase-3 (PFKFB3) was the most
      downregulated gene by anti-IL-6 receptor antibody in colorectal adenoma tissues. 
      Further analysis in human samples revealed overexpression of PFKFB3 in colorectal
      adenoma and adenocarcinoma tissues, which was also associated with lymph node
      metastasis, intravascular cancer embolus and TNM stage. In addition, the effect
      of IL-6 on CRC cells can be abolished by knocking down PRKFB3 through siRNA
      transfection. Our data suggest that chronic inflammation promotes the development
      of CRC by stimulating aerobic glycolysis and IL-6 is functioning, at least
      partly, through regulating PFKFB3 at early stage of CRC.

TI  - Dense genotyping of immune-related loci identifies HLA variants associated with
      increased risk of collagenous colitis.
PG  - 421-428

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Collagenous colitis (CC) is a major cause of chronic non-bloody
      diarrhoea, particularly in the elderly female population. The aetiology of CC is 
      unknown, and still poor is the understanding of its pathogenesis. This possibly
      involves dysregulated inflammation and immune-mediated reactions in genetically
      predisposed individuals, but the contribution of genetic factors to CC is
      underinvestigated. We systematically tested immune-related genes known to impact 
      the risk of several autoimmune diseases for their potential CC-predisposing role.
      DESIGN: Three independent cohorts of histologically confirmed CC cases (N=314)
      and controls (N=4299) from Sweden and Germany were included in a 2-step
      association analysis. Immunochip and targeted single nucleotide polymorphism
      (SNP) genotype data were produced, respectively, for discovery and replication
      purposes. Classical human leucocyte antigen (HLA) variants at 2-digit and 4-digit
      resolution were obtained via imputation from single marker genotypes. SNPs and
      HLA variants passing quality control filters were tested for association with CC 
      with logistic regression adjusting for age, sex and country of origin. RESULTS:
      Forty-two markers gave rise to genome-wide significant association signals, all
      contained within the HLA region on chromosome 6 (best p=4.2x10(-10) for SNP
      rs4143332). Among the HLA variants, most pronounced risk effects were observed
      for 8.1 haplotype alleles including DQ2.5, which was targeted and confirmed in
      the replication data set (p=2.3x10(-11); OR=2.06; 95% CI (1.67 to 2.55) in the
      combined analysis). CONCLUSIONS: HLA genotype associates with CC, thus
      implicating HLA-related immune mechanisms in its pathogenesis.

TI  - Quality of Life in Swiss Paediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: Do
      Patients and Their Parents Experience Disease in the Same Way?
PG  - 269-76
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv199 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) may impair quality of
      life (QoL) in paediatric patients. We aimed to evaluate in a nationwide cohort
      whether patients experience QoL in a different way when compared with their
      parents. METHODS: Sociodemographic and psychosocial characteristics were
      prospectively acquired from paediatric patients and their parents included in the
      Swiss IBD Cohort Study. Disease activity was evaluated by the Paediatric Crohn's 
      Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) and the Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity
      Index (PUCAI). We assessed QoL using the KIDSCREEN questionnaire. The QoL domains
      were analysed and compared between children and parents according to type of
      disease, parents' age, origin, education and marital status. RESULTS: We included
      110 children and parents (59 Crohn's disease [CD], 45 ulcerative colitis [UC], 6 
      IBD unclassified [IBDU]). There was no significant difference in QoL between CD
      and UC/IBDU, whether the disease was active or in remission. Parents perceived
      overall QoL, as well as 'mood', 'family' and 'friends' domains, lower than the
      children themselves, independently of their place of birth and education.
      However, better concordance was found on 'school performance' and 'physical
      activity' domains. Marital status and age of parents significantly influenced the
      evaluation of QoL. Mothers and fathers being married or cohabiting perceived
      significantly lower mood, family and friends domains than their children, whereas
      mothers living alone had a lower perception of the friends domain; fathers living
      alone had a lower perception of family and mood subscores. CONCLUSION: Parents of
      Swiss paediatric IBD patients significantly underestimate overall QoL and domains
      of QoL of their children independently of origin and education.

TI  - Association Between Long-Term Lipid Profiles and Disease Severity in a Large
      Cohort of Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
PG  - 865-71
LID - 10.1007/s10620-015-3932-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been linked to an increased risk
      of coronary heart disease and stroke. Dyslipidemia is a well-established risk
      factor for cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the
      long-term lipid profiles in a large cohort of IBD patients. METHODS: Data of
      patients from an IBD registry who had more than one measurement of total
      cholesterol and triglyceride levels during the follow-up period were analyzed.
      The lipid profiles of IBD patients were compared to those of the general
      population according to National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
      (2009-2012). Quartiles of cholesterol or triglyceride levels in relation to
      surrogate markers of disease severity were analyzed. RESULTS: Seven hundred and
      one IBD patients [54% Crohn's disease (CD), 46% ulcerative colitis (UC)] were
      included. IBD patients had less frequent high total cholesterol and high LDL
      cholesterol (6 vs. 13 and 5 vs. 10%) and more frequent low HDL and high
      triglycerides (24 vs. 17 and 33 vs. 25%) compared to the general population (all 
      p < 0.001). Median total cholesterol levels were lower and median triglycerides
      higher in CD compared to UC (171 vs. 184; 123 vs. 100 mg/dL; both p < 0.001). In 
      the multiple regression analysis, lipid profile was independently associated with
      hospitalizations (low cholesterol) and IBD surgeries (low cholesterol and high
      triglycerides). CONCLUSIONS: Low total cholesterol and high triglyceride levels
      are more frequent in IBD patients (in particular CD) compared to healthy controls
      and are independently associated with more severe disease.

TI  - IBD Genetic Risk Profile in Healthy First-Degree Relatives of Crohn's Disease
      Patients.
PG  - 209-15
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv197 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Family history provides important information on risk of developing
      inflammatory bowel disease [IBD], and genetic profiling of first-degree relatives
      [FDR] of Crohn's disease [CD]- affected individuals might provide additional
      information. We aimed to delineate the genetic contribution to the increased IBD 
      susceptibility observed in FDR. METHODS: N = 976 Caucasian, healthy, non-related 
      FDR; n = 4997 independent CD; and n = 5000 healthy controls [HC]; were studied.
      Genotyping for 158 IBD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs] was
      performed using the Illumina Immunochip. Risk allele frequency [RAF] differences 
      between FDR and HC cohorts were correlated with those between CD and HC cohorts. 
      CD and IBD genetic risk scores [GRS] were calculated and compared between HC,
      FDR, and CD cohorts. RESULTS: IBD-associated SNP RAF differences in FDR and HC
      cohorts were strongly correlated with those in CD and HC cohorts, correlation
      coefficient 0.63 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53 - 0.72), p = 9.90 x 10(-19). 
      There was a significant increase in CD-GRS [mean] comparing HC, FDR, and CD
      cohorts: 0.0244, 0.0250, and 0.0257 respectively [p < 1.00 x 10(-7) for each
      comparison]. There was no significant difference in the IBD-GRS between HC and
      FDR cohorts [p = 0.81]; however, IBD-GRS was significantly higher in CD compared 
      with FDR and HC cohorts [p < 1.00 x 10(-10) for each comparison]. CONCLUSION: FDR
      of CD-affected individuals are enriched with IBD risk alleles compared with HC.
      Cumulative CD-specific genetic risk is increased in FDR compared with HC.
      Prospective studies are required to determine if genotyping would facilitate
      better risk stratification of FDR.

TI  - Predictors of Thiopurine Treatment Failure in Biologic-Naive Ulcerative Colitis
      Patients.
PG  - 230-7
LID - 10.1007/s10620-015-3864-9 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Thiopurines (azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine) have been used in
      the management of UC patients for over three decades. Nearly half of patients
      with UC treated with thiopurines fail to achieve remission or lose remission
      during treatment. Factors associated with thiopurine failure are poorly
      understood. The primary aim of our study was to investigate patient-related
      factors which are associated with thiopurine failure. METHODS: TNF-alpha
      antagonist-naive patients with histological diagnosis of UC, receiving thiopurine
      therapy, with follow-up data from 1 to 3 years were included in the study. Data
      regarding demographics, laboratory results, and disease characteristics were
      collected. The primary endpoint was failure of thiopurine therapy, defined as
      treatment with steroids, therapeutic escalation to TNF-alpha antagonist therapy, 
      or need for surgery. RESULTS: Of the 563 patients identified using ICD-9 codes,
      78 TNF-alpha antagonist-naive patients with a histological diagnosis of UC,
      receiving thiopurine treatment, were identified. Over the three-year follow-up
      period, 38 patients failed thiopurine treatment. On adjusted Cox regression, BMI 
      < 25 kg/m(2) (HR 3, 95 % CI 1.55-5.83; p value = 0.001) was significantly
      associated with thiopurine failure. Furthermore, although not statistically
      significant, there was a strong trend toward thiopurine failure among patients
      with serum albumin level < 4 g/dL (HR 1.98, 95 % CI 0.97-4; p value = 0.06),
      non-smoking status (HR 2.2, 95 % CI 0.96-5.06; p value = 0.06), and higher degree
      of colon inflammation (HR 1.49, 95 % CI 0.96-2.32; p value = 0.08). DISCUSSION:
      Our results show that low body mass index is associated with increased risk of
      failure of thiopurine treatment. Furthermore, there was a strong trend toward
      thiopurine failure among patients with low serum albumin level (<4gm/dL). These
      factors should be considered as markers of non-response to thiopurine monotherapy
      for patients with moderately severe ulcerative colitis.

TI  - The effect of Clostridium butyricum MIYAIRI on the prevention of pouchitis and
      alteration of the microbiota profile in patients with ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 939-49
LID - 10.1007/s00595-015-1261-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, relapsing, and refractory disorder
      of the intestine. Total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) 
      is the preferred and standard surgical procedure for patients' refractory to
      medical therapy. Pouchitis is one of the most common long-term complications
      after IPAA. In the present study, the safety and efficacy of Clostridium
      butyricum MIYAIRI (CBM) as a probiotic were examined. METHODS: A randomized and
      placebo-controlled study was performed. Seventeen patients were recruited from
      2007 to 2013. Nine tablets of MIYA-BM((R)) or placebo were orally administered
      once daily. The cumulative pouchitis-free survival, pouch condition (using the
      modified pouch disease activity index), and blood parameters were evaluated. A
      fecal sample analysis was also performed. RESULTS: Subjects were randomly
      allocated to receive MIYA-BM or placebo (9 and 8 subjects, respectively). One
      subject in the MIYA-BM group and four subjects in the placebo group developed
      pouchitis. No side effects occurred in either group. Characteristic intestinal
      flora was observed in each group. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that probiotic
      therapy with CBM achieved favorable results with minimal side effects and might
      be a useful complementary therapy for the prevention of pouchitis in patients
      with UC who have undergone IPAA.

TI  - Food-related Quality of Life in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Development and
      Validation of a Questionnaire.
PG  - 194-201
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv192 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Psychosocial factors surrounding eating and drinking, such as
      enjoying food, managing restrictions, and maintaining social relationships,
      remain under-researched in inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]. This study aimed to 
      develop and validate a food-related quality of life [FR-QoL] questionnaire to
      systematically measure these issues in the IBD population. METHODS: Following
      semi-structured interviews with 28 IBD patients, 150 potential questionnaire
      items were generated. These were ranked by 100 IBD patients, and items were
      removed based on ceiling/floor effects and high inter-item correlations [> 0.7], 
      with 41 items being retained. In total, 323 IBD patients, 100 asthma patients
      [chronic disease control], and 117 healthy controls completed the FR-QoL
      questionnaire, alongside generic and disease-specific QoL and food satisfaction
      questionnaires. Principal components analysis [PCA], construct and discriminant
      validity, and test-retest reliability were calculated. RESULTS: Twelve items were
      removed following PCA. The reduced questionnaire [FR-QoL-29] explained 63.9% of
      the variance [Cronbach's alpha = 0.96]. FR-QoL-29 correlated significantly with
      generic QoL [r = 0.697], depression [r = -0.519], anxiety [r = -0.531], and food 
      satisfaction [r = 0.701]. The FR-QoL-29 sumscores were significantly lower for
      IBD (89.5, standard deviation [SD] 28.6) than asthma [125.4, SD 24.1; p < 0.001] 
      and healthy volunteers [123.0, SD 16.5; p<0.001]. Within IBD, worse food-related 
      QoL was found in those with moderate/high disease activity [66.7, SD 22.1]
      compared with remission/low disease activity [92.5, SD 28.1]. Test-retest
      reliability was good (intra-class correlation [ICC] = 0.83, 95% confidence
      interval [CI] = 0.76:0.88). CONCLUSIONS: The FR-QoL-29 shows good reliability and
      validity across a range of IBD characteristics. This easily administered
      questionnaire is a useful tool in identifying poor food-related QoL and in the
      future may identify areas for intervention.

TI  - Oral budesonide for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - CD007698
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD007698.pub3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Corticosteroids are first-line therapy for induction of remission in 
      ulcerative colitis. Although corticosteroids may improve symptoms, they have
      significant adverse effects. Steroids which act topically, with less systemic
      side-effects may be more desirable. Budesonide is a topically acting
      corticosteroid with extensive first pass hepatic metabolism. There are currently 
      three formulations of budesonide: two standard formulations including a
      controlled-ileal release capsule and a pH-dependent capsule both designed to
      release the drug in the distal small intestine and right colon; and the newer
      Budesonide-MMX(R) capsule designed to release the drug throughout the entire
      colon. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety 
      of oral budesonide for the induction of remission in ulcerative colitis. SEARCH
      METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and the Cochrane IBD Group
      Specialised Register from inception to April 2015. We also searched reference
      lists of articles, conference proceedings and ClinicalTrials.gov. SELECTION
      CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing oral budesonide to placebo or
      another active therapy for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis were
      considered eligible. There were no exclusions based on patient age or the type,
      dose, duration or formulation of budesonide therapy. DATA COLLECTION AND
      ANALYSIS: Two independent investigators reviewed studies for eligibility,
      extracted data and assessed study quality. Methodological quality was assessed
      using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The overall quality of the evidence
      supporting the outcomes was evaluated using the GRADE criteria. The primary
      outcome was induction of remission (as defined by the primary studies) at week
      eight. Secondary outcomes included clinical, endoscopic and histologic
      improvement, adverse events and early withdrawal. We calculated the risk ratio
      (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for each dichotomous outcome 
      and the mean difference (MD) and corresponding 95% CI for each continuous
      outcome. Data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. MAIN RESULTS: Six
      studies (1808 participants) were included. Four studies compared
      budesonide-MMX(R) with placebo, one small pilot study looked at clinical
      remission at week four, and was subsequently followed by three large, studies
      that assessed combined clinical and endoscopic remission at week eight. Although 
      two placebo-controlled studies had mesalamine and Entocort (standard budesonide) 
      treatment arms, these studies were not sufficiently powered to compare
      Budesonide-MMX(R) with these active comparators. One small study compared
      standard budesonide with prednisolone and one study compared standard budesonide 
      to mesalamine. Four studies were rated as low risk of bias and two studies had an
      unclear risk of bias. A pooled analysis of three studies (900 participants)
      showed that budesonide-MMX(R) 9 mg was significantly superior to placebo for
      inducing remission (combined clinical and endoscopic remission) at 8 weeks.
      Fifteen per cent (71/462) of budesonide-MMX(R) 9 mg patients achieved remission
      compared to 7% (30/438) of placebo patients (RR 2.25, 95% CI 1.50 to 3.39). A
      GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this
      outcome was moderate due to sparse data (101 events). A subgroup analysis by
      concurrent mesalamine use suggests higher efficacy in the 442 patients who were
      not considered to be mesalamine-refractory (RR 2.89, 95% CI 1.59 to 5.25). A
      subgroup analysis by disease location suggests budesonide is most effective in
      patients with left-sided disease (RR 2.98, 95% CI 1.56 to 5.67; 289 patients). A 
      small pilot study reported no statistically significant difference in endoscopic 
      remission between budesonide and prednisolone (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.42; 72
      patients). GRADE indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting
      this outcome was very low due to unclear risk of bias and very sparse data (10
      events). Standard oral budesonide was significantly less likely to induce
      clinical remission than oral mesalamine after 8 weeks of therapy (RR 0.72, 95% CI
      0.57 to 0.91; 1 study, 343 patients). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall
      quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was moderate due to sparse data
      (161 events). Another study found no difference in remission rates between
      budesonide-MMX(R) 9 mg and mesalamine (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.71; 247
      patients). GRADE indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting
      this outcome was low due to very sparse data (37 events). One study found no
      difference in remission rates between budesonide-MMX(R) 9 mg and standard
      budesonide 9 mg (RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.65; 212 patients). A GRADE analysis
      indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was
      low due to very sparse data (32 events). Suppression of plasma cortisol was more 
      common in prednisolone-treated patients (RR 0.02, 95% CI 0.0 to 0.33). While
      budesonide does appear to suppress morning cortisol to some extent, mean morning 
      cortisol values remained within the normal range in 2 large studies (n = 899) and
      there was no difference in glucocorticoid-related side-effects across different
      treatment groups. Further, study withdrawal due to adverse events was not more
      common in budesonide compared with placebo treated patients (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.53
      to 1.38). Common adverse events included worsening ulcerative colitis, headache, 
      pyrexia, insomnia, back pain, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, flatulence and
      nasopharyngitis. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Moderate quality evidence to supports the 
      use of oral budesonide-MMX(R) at a 9 mg daily dose for induction of remission in 
      active ulcerative colitis, particularly in patients with left-sided colitis.
      Budesonide-MMX(R) 9 mg daily is effective for induction of remission in the
      presence or absence of concurrent 5-ASA therapy. Further, budesonide-MMX(R)
      appears to be safe, and does not lead to significant impairment of
      adrenocorticoid function compared to placebo. Moderate quality evidence from a
      single study suggests that mesalamine may be superior to standard budesonide for 
      the treatment of active ulcerative colitis. Low quality evidence from one study
      found no difference in remission rates between budesonide MMX(R) and mesalamine. 
      Very low quality evidence from one small study showed no difference in endoscopic
      remission rates between standard budesonide and prednisolone. Low quality
      evidence from one study showed no difference in remission rates between
      budesonide-MMX(R) and standard budesonide. Adequately powered studies are needed 
      to allow conclusions regarding the comparative efficacy and safety of budesonide 
      versus prednisolone, budesonide-MMX(R) versus standard budesonide and budesonide 
      versus mesalamine.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the two major forms of
      inflammatory bowel disease; treatment strategies have historically been
      determined by this binary categorisation. Genetic studies have identified 163
      susceptibility loci for inflammatory bowel disease, mostly shared between Crohn's
      disease and ulcerative colitis. We undertook the largest genotype association
      study, to date, in widely used clinical subphenotypes of inflammatory bowel
      disease with the goal of further understanding the biological relations between
      diseases. METHODS: This study included patients from 49 centres in 16 countries
      in Europe, North America, and Australasia. We applied the Montreal classification
      system of inflammatory bowel disease subphenotypes to 34,819 patients (19,713
      with Crohn's disease, 14,683 with ulcerative colitis) genotyped on the Immunochip
      array. We tested for genotype-phenotype associations across 156,154 genetic
      variants. We generated genetic risk scores by combining information from all
      known inflammatory bowel disease associations to summarise the total load of
      genetic risk for a particular phenotype. We used these risk scores to test the
      hypothesis that colonic Crohn's disease, ileal Crohn's disease, and ulcerative
      colitis are all genetically distinct from each other, and to attempt to identify 
      patients with a mismatch between clinical diagnosis and genetic risk profile.
      FINDINGS: After quality control, the primary analysis included 29,838 patients
      (16,902 with Crohn's disease, 12,597 with ulcerative colitis). Three loci (NOD2, 
      MHC, and MST1 3p21) were associated with subphenotypes of inflammatory bowel
      disease, mainly disease location (essentially fixed over time; median follow-up
      of 10.5 years). Little or no genetic association with disease behaviour (which
      changed dramatically over time) remained after conditioning on disease location
      and age at onset. The genetic risk score representing all known risk alleles for 
      inflammatory bowel disease showed strong association with disease subphenotype
      (p=1.65 x 10(-78)), even after exclusion of NOD2, MHC, and 3p21 (p=9.23 x
      10(-18)). Predictive models based on the genetic risk score strongly
      distinguished colonic from ileal Crohn's disease. Our genetic risk score could
      also identify a small number of patients with discrepant genetic risk profiles
      who were significantly more likely to have a revised diagnosis after follow-up
      (p=6.8 x 10(-4)). INTERPRETATION: Our data support a continuum of disorders
      within inflammatory bowel disease, much better explained by three groups (ileal
      Crohn's disease, colonic Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis) than by Crohn's
      disease and ulcerative colitis as currently defined. Disease location is an
      intrinsic aspect of a patient's disease, in part genetically determined, and the 
      major driver to changes in disease behaviour over time. FUNDING: International

TI  - Sexually transmitted infectious colitis vs inflammatory bowel disease:
      distinguishing features from a case-controlled study.
PG  - 771-81
LID - 10.1309/AJCPOID4JIJ6PISC [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Sexually transmitted infectious (STI) colitis often raises concern
      for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In this study, we compare histologic
      features of IBD with STI colitis caused by syphilis and lymphogranuloma venereum.
      METHODS: The STI colitis group included 10 unique colorectal biopsy specimens in 
      patients with clinically confirmed syphilis and/or lymphogranuloma venereum. The 
      STI biopsy specimens were compared with patients matched for age, sex, and site
      with Crohn disease (n = 10) or ulcerative colitis (n = 10). All IBD controls had 
      an established history of IBD (up to 276 months of follow-up, mean follow-up =
      102 months). RESULTS: Discriminating features (P < .05) of STI colitis included
      its exclusive identification in human immunodeficiency virus-positive men who
      have sex with men, anal pain, and anal discharge. STI colitis contained the triad
      of (1) minimal active chronic crypt centric damage, (2) a lack of mucosal
      eosinophilia, and (3) submucosal plasma cells, endothelial swelling, and
      perivascular plasma cells. Nondiscriminating features (P > .05) included rectal
      bleeding, endoscopic appearance, skip lesions, ulcerations, aphthoid lesions,
      granulomata, foreign body giant cells, neural hyperplasia, fibrosis, and lymphoid
      aggregates. CONCLUSIONS: While STI colitis shares many overlapping features with 
      IBD, histologic and clinical discriminating features may be helpful when
      confronted with that differential diagnosis.

TI  - Development and validation of the Nancy histological index for UC.
PG  - 43-49
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2015-310187 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We developed a validated index for assessing histological disease
      activity in UC and established its responsiveness. METHODS: Two hundred biopsies 
      were scored. The outcome was the Global Visual Evaluation (GVE). Eight
      histological features were tested. The Nancy index was developed by multiple
      linear regression and bootstrap process to create an index that best matched the 
      GVE. Goodness of fit was assessed by the adjusted R squared (adjusted R(2)). The 
      second step was the validation of the index: 100 biopsies were scored for the
      Nancy index by three pathologists from different centres. Inter-reader
      reliability was evaluated for each reader. The relationship between the change of
      the Nancy index and the Geboes index was assessed to assess the responsiveness.
      RESULTS: After backward selection with bootstrap validation, 3/8 items were
      selected: ulceration (adjusted R(2)=0.55), acute inflammatory infiltrate
      (adjusted R(2)=0.88) and chronic inflammatory infiltrate (adjusted R(2)=0.79).
      The Nancy index is defined by a 5-level classification ranging from grade 0
      (absence of significant histological disease activity) to grade 4 (severely
      active disease). The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for the intrareader
      reliability was 0.88 (95% CI 0.82 to 0.92) and the index had good inter-reader
      reliability (ICC=0.86 (0.81 to 0.99)). The correlation between the Nancy index
      and the Geboes score or the GVE was very good. The index had a good
      responsiveness with a high correlation between changes in the Geboes score and
      changes in the Nancy index (0.910 (0.813 to 0.955)). CONCLUSIONS: A three
      descriptor histological index has been validated for use in clinical practice and
      clinical trials.

      About Diet?

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, 
      and unclassified IBD, continues to cause significant morbidity. While its
      incidence is increasing, no clear etiology and no cure have yet been discovered. 
      Recent findings suggest that IBD may have a multifactorial etiology, where
      complex interactions between genetics, epigenetics, environmental factors
      (including diet but also infections, antibiotics, and sanitation), and host
      immune system lead to abnormal immune responses and chronic inflammation. Over
      the past years, the role of altered gut microbiota (in both composition and
      function) in IBD pathogenesis has emerged as an outstanding area of interest.
      According to new findings, gut dysbiosis may appear as a key element in
      initiation of inflammation in IBD and its complications. Moreover, complex
      metagenomic studies provide possibilities to distinguish between IBD types and
      appreciate severity and prognosis of the disease, as well as response to therapy.
      This review provides an updated knowledge of recent findings linking altered
      bacterial composition and functions, viruses, and fungi to IBD pathogenesis. It
      also highlights the complex genetic, epigenetic, immune, and microbial
      interactions in relation to environmental factors (including diet). We overview
      the actual options to manipulate the altered microbiota, such as modified diet,
      probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, antibiotics, and fecal transplantation.
      Future possible therapies are also included. Targeting altered microbiota could
      be the next therapeutic personalized approach, but more research and
      well-designed comparative prospective studies are required to formulate adequate 
      directions for prevention and therapy.

TI  - Ocular Manifestations in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Are Associated with Other
      Extra-intestinal Manifestations, Gender, and Genes Implicated in Other
      Immune-related Traits.
PG  - 43-9
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv178 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There has been considerable progress in identifying inflammatory
      bowel disease [IBD] susceptibility genes but little progress in examining the
      role of genetic variation in the development of the extra-intestinal
      manifestations [EIMs] of IBD. This study identified clinical, serological, and
      genetic factors associated with ocular EIMs [O-EIMs] in IBD. METHODS: We
      performed a retrospective case-control study of IBD patients, comparing those
      with and without O-EIMs using the Cedars-Sinai IBD Research Repository and the
      NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium Repository. Genotyping was performed using Illumina
      whole genome platforms. RESULTS: In all, 124 cases and 3328 controls with
      available clinical data were identified; 103 cases and 2808 controls had genetic 
      data available. Erythema nodosum and peripheral arthritis particularly were
      common in patients with O-EIMs [p = 2.77 x 10(-13) and p = 2.58 x 10(-13),
      respectively] with increasing odds ratios for O-EIMs with each additional
      non-ocular-EIM [for >/= 2 EIMs, odds ratio 14.72]. Nominal association with
      O-EIMs was observed at several known IBD susceptibility single nuclear
      polymorphisms. One locus, containing RBM19, achieved genome-wide level of
      significance for association with O-EIMs. CONCLUSIONS: In IBD, O-EIMs co-occur
      with musculoskeletal and skin manifestations and, in this study, are nominally
      associated with known IBD loci. Additional cohorts are needed to verify these
      results and identify additional genes.

TI  - Scientific evidence for health effects attributed to the consumption of
      probiotics and prebiotics: an update for current perspectives and future
      challenges.
PG  - 1993-2015
LID - 10.1017/S0007114515003864 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics and prebiotics, mainly commercialised as food ingredients and also as 
      supplements, are considered highly profitable niche markets. However, in recent
      years, the food industry has suffered from a series of health claim restrictions 
      on probiotics and prebiotics in many parts of the world, including those made by 
      the European Food Safety Authority. Therefore, we reviewed the core benefits of
      probiotic and prebiotic consumption on health. A number of studies have examined 
      the prevention and/or management of intestinal infections, respiratory tract
      infections, CVD, osteoporosis, urogenital infections, cavities, periodontal
      disease and halitosis, allergic reactions, inflammatory bowel disease and
      irritable bowel syndrome and Helicobacter pylori gastric infections. In fact, a
      deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in human microbiota and immune
      system modulation by probiotics and prebiotics relies on continuous efforts to
      establish suitable biomarkers of health and diseases risk factors for the design 
      of clinical trials required for health claim approval. In spite of the promising 
      results, the performance of large, long-term, well-planned, well-aligned clinical
      studies is crucial to provide more reliability and a more solid basis for the
      outcomes achieved and to support the potential use of probiotics and prebiotics
      in clinical practice.

      Disease in the USA.
PG  - 389-99
LID - 10.1007/s10620-015-3895-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, debilitating condition
      with high emergency department (ED) utilization. We aimed to investigate the
      utilization patterns of ED by IBD patients and measure hospitalization and
      surgical rates following ED visits. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study
      of adults with IBD listed as the primary ED diagnosis from the 2009 to 2011
      Nationwide Emergency Department Sample. The characteristics of the IBD-related ED
      visits in relation to following hospitalizations and surgeries were analyzed.
      RESULTS: Adult IBD patients constitute 0.09 % of the total ED visits. Crohn's
      disease (CD) contributed to 69 % of the IBD-ED visits. The hospitalization rate
      from ED was 59.9 % nationally, ranging from 56 % in west to 69 % in northeast.
      The most significant factors associated with hospitalization were intra-abdominal
      abscess [odds ratio (OR) 24.22], bowel obstruction (OR 17.77), anemia (OR 7.54), 
      malnutrition (OR 6.29), hypovolemia/electrolyte abnormalities (OR 5.57), and
      fever/abnormal white cell count (OR 3.18). Patients with CD (OR 0.66), low-income
      group (OR 0.90), and female gender (OR 0.87) have a lower odds of getting
      hospitalized. Age above 65 years (OR 1.63), CD (OR 1.89), bowel obstruction (OR
      9.24), and intra-abdominal abscess (OR 18.41) were significantly associated with 
      surgical intervention. CONCLUSION: The IBD-related ED visits have remained
      relatively stable from 2009 to 2011. The presence of anemia, malnutrition,
      hypovolemia, electrolyte abnormalities, fever, abnormal white cell count, bowel
      obstruction, or intra-abdominal abscess during the ED visit was associated with
      hospitalization. The presence of bowel obstruction and intra-abdominal abscess
      was strongly associated with surgical intervention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tobacco use patterns and effects in patients with Inflammatory Bowel 
      Disease have been extensively studied, however the role and patterns of cannabis 
      use remains poorly defined. Our aim was to evaluate patterns of marijuana use in 
      a large population based survey. METHODS: Cases were identified from the NHANES
      database from the National Center for Health Statistics for the time period from 
      January, 2009 through December, 2010 as having ulcerative colitis or Crohn's
      disease, and exact matched with controls using the Propensity Score Module of
      SPSS, based on age, gender, and sample weighted using the nearest neighbor
      method. RESULTS: After weighting, 2084,895 subjects with IBD and 2013,901 control
      subjects were identified with no significant differences in demographic
      characteristics. Subjects with IBD had a higher incidence of ever having used
      marijuana/hashish (M/H) (67.3% vs. 60.0%) and an earlier age of onset of M/H use 
      (15.7 years vs. 19.6 years). Patients with IBD were less likely to have used M/H 
      every month for a year, but more likely to use a heavier amount per day (64.9%
      subjects with IBD used three or more joints per day vs. 80.5% of subjects without
      IBD used two or fewer joints per day). In multivariable logistic regression,
      presence of IBD, male gender, and age over 40 years predicted M/H use.
      CONCLUSION: Our study is the first to evaluate marijuana patterns in a
      large-scale population based survey. Older, male IBD patients have the highest
      odds of marijuana use.

TI  - DNA Methylation Profiling in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Provides New Insights
      into Disease Pathogenesis.
PG  - 77-86
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv176 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are heterogeneous
      disorders with complex aetiology. Quantitative genetic studies suggest that only 
      a small proportion of the disease variance observed in IBD is accounted for by
      genetic variation, indicating a potential role for differential epigenetic
      regulation in disease aetiology. The aim of this study was to assess genome-wide 
      DNA methylation changes specifically associated with ulcerative colitis (UC),
      Crohn's disease (CD) and IBD activity. METHODS: DNA methylation was quantified in
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 149 IBD cases (61 UC, 88 CD) and 
      39 controls using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Technical and
      functional validation was performed using pyrosequencing and the real-time
      polymerase chain reaction. Cross-tissue replication of the top differentially
      methylated positions (DMPs) was tested in colonic mucosa tissue samples obtained 
      from paediatric IBD cases and controls. RESULTS: A total of 3196 probes were
      differentially methylated between CD cases and controls, while 1481 probes were
      differentially methylated between UC cases and controls. There was considerable
      (45%) overlap between UC and CD DMPs. The top-ranked IBD-associated PBMC
      differentially methylated region (promoter region of TRIM39-RPP2) was also
      significantly hypomethylated in colonic mucosa from paediatric UC patients. In
      addition, we confirmed TRAF6 hypermethylation using pyrosequencing and found
      reduced TRAF6 gene expression in PBMCs of IBD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our data
      provide new insights into differential epigenetic regulation of genes and
      molecular pathways, which may contribute to the pathogenesis and activity of IBD.

TI  - Micronutrient deficiencies in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 576-81
LID - 10.1097/MCO.0000000000000226 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Malnutrition, protein-energy, and micronutrient deficiencies
      are common among patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The deficiencies
      are a manifestation of the complicated disease and a cause of morbidity. The
      present review summarizes recent advances and evidence-based knowledge regarding 
      micronutrients in relation to patients with IBD. RECENT FINDINGS: Micronutrient
      deficiencies occur in more than half of patients with IBD. Most common are
      deficiencies of iron, B12, vitamin D, vitamin K, folic acid, selenium, zinc,
      vitamin B6, and vitamin B1. Deficiencies are more common in Crohn's disease than 
      in ulcerative colitis, and more in active disease than at times of remission.
      Micronutrient deficiency is associated with prolonged and complicated course of
      disease. Iron deficiency is the most common cause for anemia. Definite diagnosis 
      of B12 deficiency cannot be established by serum levels alone. Vitamin D and
      vitamin K deficiencies are thought to be associated with heightened inflammatory 
      state. The relationship of these deficiencies with bone disease is controversial.
      The present review focuses on the significance, epidemiology, treatment options, 
      and recommendations regarding micronutrient deficiencies in IBD. SUMMARY:
      Micronutrient deficiencies are common and have clinical significance. High
      suspicion for micronutrient deficiencies is advocated so that treatable causes of
      morbidity are treated appropriately and late and irreversible sequlae are
      prevented.

AB  - The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn
      disease, are chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract most
      often diagnosed in adolescence and young adulthood, with a rising incidence in
      pediatric populations. These disorders are common enough in children that most
      pediatricians and other pediatric clinicians will encounter children with IBD in 
      their general practice. Inflammatory bowel disease is caused by a dysregulated
      mucosal immune response to the intestinal microflora in genetically predisposed
      hosts. Although children can present with the classic symptoms of weight loss,
      abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea, many present with nonclassic symptoms of
      isolated poor growth, anemia, or other extraintestinal manifestations. Once IBD
      is diagnosed, the goals of therapy consist of eliminating symptoms, normalizing
      quality of life, restoring growth, and preventing complications while minimizing 
      the adverse effects of medications. Unique considerations when treating children 
      and adolescents with IBD include attention to the effects of the disease on
      growth and development, bone health, and psychosocial functioning. The purpose of
      this review is to provide a contemporary overview of the epidemiologic features, 
      pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of IBD in children and adolescents.

PG  - 792-8
LID - 10.1111/petr.12578 [doi]
AB  - CDIs are on the rise in both hospital and community settings in adults and
      children. Children with cancer or a history of HSCT or SOT appear to be at higher
      risk for primary disease, recurrent disease, and severe outcomes when compared to
      children with other comorbidities. The reasons for this are not clear and no
      studies to date have analyzed risk factors for CDI in pediatric transplant
      patients. Colonization rates in children with cancer and a transplant history are
      also high. Determining which children are colonized with Clostridium difficile
      and symptomatic from another source vs. symptomatic from CDI is difficult and a
      clinical conundrum for the transplant physician. The use of fecal transplantation
      for severe or rCDI is likely safe and effective in the immunosuppressed pediatric
      cancer or transplant patient, but this will need to be more thoroughly studied in
      this patient population.

TI  - Gastro-Hepatic Fistula with Liver Abscess: A Rare Complication of a Common
      Procedure.
PG  - 652-7
LID - 10.12659/AJCR.895098 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is a procedure used most
      commonly for enteral access for nutrition and continuation of treatment in
      patients when oral nutrition is not possible. It is a safe, cost-effective
      procedure; however, has its own complications and adverse effects that can be
      life threatening. CASE REPORT: Here, we present the case of a 76-year-old woman
      who was sent to a long-term skilled nursing facility after discharge from a
      hospital a month before, initially admitted for seizures after a fall and
      diabetic ketoacidosis. She underwent tracheostomy for prolonged respiratory
      support on mechanical ventilation and also underwent PEG tube placement. She
      presented in our Emergency Department (ED) with septic shock and multi-organ
      failure initially attributed to urinary tract infection and possible Clostridium 
      difficile colitis. However, on further evaluation she was found to have a
      dislodged PEG tube, which led to development of gastro-hepatic fistula and
      multiple liver abscesses with liver necrosis. Comfort measures were implemented
      and she died due to her critical condition. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our
      knowledge, this is the first case of a PEG tube, with no post-procedure
      complications, that dislodged and resulted in formation of a gastro-hepatic
      fistula and multiple liver abscesses. It is the first case that describes liver
      injury resulting from dislodgement rather than the liver being injured during the
      procedure of PEG tube placement itself.

TI  - Increased catabolism and decreased unsaturation of ganglioside in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 10080-90
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v21.i35.10080 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To investigate whether accelerated catabolism of ganglioside and decreased
      ganglioside content contribute to the etiology of pro-inflammatory intestinal
      disease. METHODS: Intestinal mucosa from terminal ileum or colon was obtained
      from patients with ulcerative colitis or inflammatory Crohn's disease (n = 11)
      undergoing bowel resection and compared to control samples of normal intestine
      from patients with benign colon polyps (n = 6) and colorectal cancer (n = 12) in 
      this observational case-control study. Gangliosides and phospholipids of
      intestinal mucosa were characterized by class and ceramide or fatty acid
      composition using liquid chromatography triple-quad mass spectrometry. Content
      and composition of ganglioside classes GM1, GM3, GD3, GD1a, GT1 and GT3 were
      compared among subject groups. Content and composition of phospholipid classes
      phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine were compared among subject
      groups. Unsaturation index of individual ganglioside and phospholipid classes was
      computed and compared among subject groups. Ganglioside catabolism enzymes
      beta-hexosaminidase A (HEXA) and sialidase-3 (NEU3) were measured in intestinal
      mucosa using western blot and compared among subject groups. RESULTS: Relative
      GM3 ganglioside content was 2-fold higher (P < 0.05) in intestine from patients
      with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) compared to control intestine. The quantity
      of GM3 and ratio of GM3/GD3 was also higher in IBD intestine than control tissue 
      (P < 0.05). Control intestine exhibited 3-fold higher (P < 0.01) relative GD1a
      ganglioside content than IBD intestine. GD3 and GD1a species of ganglioside
      containing three unsaturated bonds were present in control intestine, but were
      not detected in IBD intestine. The relative content of PC containing more than
      two unsaturated bonds was 30% lower in IBD intestine than control intestine (P < 
      0.05). The relative content of HEXA in IBD intestine was increased 1.7-fold (P < 
      0.05) and NEU3 was increased 8.3-fold (P < 0.01) compared to normal intestine.
      Intestinal mucosa in IBD is characterized by increased GM3 content, decreased
      GD1a, and a reduction in polyunsaturated fatty acid constituents in GD3, GD1a and
      PC. CONCLUSION: This study suggests a new paradigm by proposing that IBD occurs
      as a consequence of increased metabolism of specific gangliosides.

TI  - Early Prediction of Cancer Progression by Depth-Resolved Nanoscale Mapping of
      Nuclear Architecture from Unstained Tissue Specimens.
PG  - 4718-27
LID - 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-15-1274 [doi]
AB  - Early cancer detection currently relies on screening the entire at-risk
      population, as with colonoscopy and mammography. Therefore, frequent, invasive
      surveillance of patients at risk for developing cancer carries financial,
      physical, and emotional burdens because clinicians lack tools to accurately
      predict which patients will actually progress into malignancy. Here, we present a
      new method to predict cancer progression risk via nanoscale nuclear architecture 
      mapping (nanoNAM) of unstained tissue sections based on the intrinsic density
      alteration of nuclear structure rather than the amount of stain uptake. We
      demonstrate that nanoNAM detects a gradual increase in the density alteration of 
      nuclear architecture during malignant transformation in animal models of colon
      carcinogenesis and in human patients with ulcerative colitis, even in tissue that
      appears histologically normal according to pathologists. We evaluated the ability
      of nanoNAM to predict "future" cancer progression in patients with ulcerative
      colitis who did and did not develop colon cancer up to 13 years after their
      initial colonoscopy. NanoNAM of the initial biopsies correctly classified 12 of
      15 patients who eventually developed colon cancer and 15 of 18 who did not, with 
      an overall accuracy of 85%. Taken together, our findings demonstrate great
      potential for nanoNAM in predicting cancer progression risk and suggest that
      further validation in a multicenter study with larger cohorts may eventually
      advance this method to become a routine clinical test.

TI  - Step-up fecal microbiota transplantation strategy: a pilot study for
      steroid-dependent ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 298
LID - 10.1186/s12967-015-0646-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The strategy of using fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for
      refractory ulcerative colitis (UC) remains unclear if single FMT failed to induce
      remission. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a designed
      step-up FMT strategy for the steroid-dependent UC. METHODS: Fifteen patients with
      steroid-dependent UC were enrolled, and treated with step-up FMT strategy.
      Follow-up clinical data was collected for a minimum of 3 months. Fecal microbiota
      composition before and post FMT of patients and related donors were analyzed by
      16S rRNA sequencing. RESULTS: Eight of fourteen (57.1 %) patients achieved
      clinical improvement and were able to discontinue steroids following step-up FMT.
      One patient was lost to follow-up. Among the 8 patients who responded, five (35.7
      %) received one FMT therapy, one (7.1 %) received two FMTs, and two (14.2 %)
      received two FMTs plus a scheduled course of steroids. Four (28.6 %) of the 8
      patients who responded maintained long-term remission during follow-up (3-18
      months). Six patients (42.9 %) failed to meet the criteria of clinical
      improvement and maintained steroid dependence, though three experienced transient
      or partial improvement. Microbiota analysis showed that FMT altered the
      composition greatly, and a microbiota composition highly similar to that of the
      donor emerged in the patients with successful treatment. No severe adverse events
      occurred during treatment and follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Step-up FMT strategy shows 
      promise as a therapeutic strategy for patients with steroid-dependent UC, likely 
      due to the successful restructuring of gut microbial composition. TRIAL

AB  - PURPOSE: Determination of overweight and obesity prevalence in children with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) at the time of diagnosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 
      This was a multicenter retrospective study. The study group consisted of children
      with new cases of IBD diagnosed in 2005-2013 according to the Porto criteria.
      Hospital admission records were reviewed for demographic and clinical
      characteristics. BMI-for-age and gender percentile charts were used to define
      overweight as >/=85th BMI percentile and obesity as >/=95th BMI percentile.
      RESULTS: 675 patients were evaluated: 368 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 307 with 
      ulcerative colitis (UC). Of these, 54.8% were boys and 45.2% were girls. There
      were no statistically significant differences in age, weight, height and disease 
      activity between the CD and UC patients. The UC patients had higher BMI values
      than the CD patients. The prevalence of overweight and obesity was higher in the 
      UC than the CD patients (4.89% CI95 2.76-7.93 vs. 2.45% CI95 1.12-4.59 and 8.47% 
      CI95 5.61-12.16 vs. 1.9% CI95 0.77-3.88, respectively); the differences were
      statistically significant (-2.44% CI95 -5.45 to 0.49 and -6.57% CI95 -10 to -3.1,
      respectively). The risk of overweight/obesity was 3.5 times higher for patients
      with UC (OR=0.272, CI95 0.14-0.49, p=0.0004). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of
      overweight and obesity in newly diagnosed children with IBD was 8.4% and was
      higher in patients with UC than in patients with CD. The results of this study
      have shown that not only malnourished children may suffer from IBD but also
      children who are overweight or obese at the time of diagnosis.

TI  - The outcome of infliximab dose doubling in 157 patients with ulcerative colitis
      after loss of response to infliximab.
PG  - 1192-9
LID - 10.1111/apt.13393 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Optimising infliximab therapy is recommended in inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) patients who lose response to infliximab; however, there are no
      data on the outcome of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients after doubling the dose. 
      AIM: To determine the efficacy and safety of infliximab dose doubling in UC
      patients with a loss of response to infliximab. METHODS: From January 2006 to May
      2013, we retrospectively reviewed the outcome of the consecutive UC patients who 
      were treated with infliximab dose doubling (10 mg/kg) for loss of response in
      four French academic centres. The clinical response and remission were assessed. 
      A composite event-free survival analysis was performed using the log-rank test
      and the Cox model. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-seven patients [84 males;
      median age 37. 6 (IQR 28.2-49.4) years] were included. The median follow-up after
      infliximab dose doubling was 1.8 (1.0-3.1) years. At weeks 8 and 24, 55% and 43% 
      of the patients achieved a clinical response respectively. The probabilities of
      the event-free survival were 71%, 61% and 55% at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years
      respectively. In the multivariate analysis, the predictors of infliximab dose
      doubling failure were the absence of the introduction of an immunomodulator
      concomitantly to dose doubling, a partial Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity
      Index >6, a C-reactive protein level >10 mg/L, a leucocyte count >8000/mm(3) and 
      a haemoglobin level <12.5 g/dL. Adverse events were reported in 12 patients (8%).
      CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab dose doubling led to short- and long-term event-free
      survival in UC patients, who had a loss of response to infliximab, in greater
      than 50% of the cases. The benefits of such a strategy were significantly
      improved by adding a concomitant immunomodulator.

TI  - Immunogenicity and Safety of Influenza Vaccine in Inflammatory Bowel Disease
      Patients Treated or not with Immunomodulators and/or Biologics: A Two-year
      Prospective Study.
PG  - 1096-107
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv152 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Data on the efficacy and safety of seasonal influenza
      vaccines in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remain scarce. The aim
      of the study was to evaluate the impact of immunosuppressive (IS) therapeutics on
      serological response to 2-year influenza vaccination in IBD adults. METHODS: A
      multicentre prospective study performed in 255 IBD adults (18-64 years) receiving
      the trivalent influenza vaccine in the years 2009-2010 and 2010-2011.
      Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titres were assessed before and 3 weeks and 6
      months after vaccination. RESULTS: At inclusion, 31 patients were receiving no IS
      treatment (Group A), 77 were receiving IS treatment without anti-TNF (Group B)
      and 117 were receiving anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) treatment with or
      without IS treatment (Group C). Three weeks after the first vaccination, rates of
      seroprotection were 77, 75 and 66% for strain A/H1N12007 (p = 0.35), 77, 68 and
      52% for strain A/H3N2 (p = 0.014) and 97, 96 and 95% for strain B (p = 0.99) in
      Groups A, B and C, respectively. Seroconversion rates for A/H1N12007 (67, 64 and 
      54%; p = 0.28), A/H3N2 (63, 50 and 41%; p = 0.074) and strain B (63, 76 and 60%; 
      p = 0.078) were not significantly different among treatment groups. At 6 months
      after vaccination, seroprotection rates were lower in Group C compared with
      Groups A and B. Comparable results were observed for the second year of
      vaccination. No impact on Harvey-Bradshaw and Mayo scores was detected.
      CONCLUSIONS: Influenza vaccine yielded high seroprotection rates in IBD patients.
      Persistence of seroprotection was lower in patients with anti-TNF treatment.

AB  - Studies suggest that consumption of omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids
      (PUFA) plays a protective role in inflammatory bowel disease; however, the use of
      plant-derived oils rich in alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) has not been widely
      investigated. The aims of this study were to test the effects of two different
      sources of (n-3) PUFA, fish and plant-derived oils, in two animal models of
      experimental colitis and to determine whether the (n-3) PUFA-enriched diets could
      ameliorate the inflammatory status. Rats were fed diets rich in corn, fish or
      sage oil with or without vitamin A supplementation for 3weeks then colitis was
      induced by adding dextran sodium sulfate to the drinking water or by injecting
      2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid. We show that colitic rats fed the sage oil
      diets had a lower inflammatory response, improved histological repair and had
      less necrotic damage in the mucosa when compared to the corn and fish oil groups.
      Colonic damage and myeloperoxidase activity were significantly lower. Colonic
      mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory genes including interleukin IL-6, cyclooxygenase 
      2 and tumor necrosis factor alpha were markedly down-regulated in rats fed fish
      and sage oils compared to control. These results were supported by experiments in
      the human colonic epithelial cell line Caco-2, where ALA supplementation was
      shown to be effective in inhibiting inflammation induced by IL-1beta by
      down-regulating mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory genes including IL-8, COX2 and
      inducible nitric oxide synthase. Taken together, these results suggest that
      plant-derived oil rich in ALA could ameliorate the inflammatory damage in
      colitis.

AB  - There is a close relationship between the human host and the intestinal
      microbiota, which is an assortment of microorganisms, protecting the intestine
      against colonization by exogenous pathogens. Moreover, the intestinal microbiota 
      play a critical role in providing nutrition and the modulation of host immune
      homeostasis. Recent reports indicate that some strains of intestinal bacteria are
      responsible for intestinal ulceration and chronic inflammation in inflammatory
      bowel diseases (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD).
      Understanding the interaction of the intestinal microbiota with pathogens and the
      human host might provide new strategies treating patients with IBD. This review
      focuses on the important role that the intestinal microbiota plays in maintaining
      innate immunity in the pathogenesis and etiology of UC and discusses new
      antibiotic therapies targeting the intestinal microbiota.

TI  - Th17 Cells as Potential Probiotic Therapeutic Targets in Inflammatory Bowel
      Diseases.
PG  - 20841-58
LID - 10.3390/ijms160920841 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are characterized by wasting and chronic
      intestinal inflammation triggered by various cytokine-mediated pathways. In
      recent years, it was shown that T helper 17 (Th17) cells are involved in the
      pathogenesis of IBD, which makes them an attractive therapeutic target. Th17
      cells preferentially produce interleukin (IL)-17A-F as signature cytokines. The
      role of the interplay between host genetics and intestinal microbiota in the
      pathogenesis of IBD was demonstrated. Probiotics are live microorganisms that
      when orally ingested in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit to the host by 
      modulating the enteric flora or by stimulating the local immune system. Several
      studies indicated the effectiveness of probiotics in preventing and treating IBD 
      (ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease). Furthermore, there is mounting
      evidence of probiotics selectively targeting the Th17 lineage in the prevention
      and management of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as IBD. This review
      highlights critical roles of Th17 cells in the pathogenesis of IBD and the
      rationale for using probiotics as a novel therapeutic approach for IBD through
      manipulation of Th17 cells. The potential molecular mechanisms by which
      probiotics modulate Th17 cells differentiation and production are also discussed.

TI  - Fecal lactoferrin, a marker of intestinal inflammation in children with
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 541-5
LID - 10.18388/abp.2015_982 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the usefulness of fecal lactoferrin in the
      diagnosis and monitoring of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children. The
      study included 52 children with IBD (24 with Crohn's disease and 28 with
      ulcerative colitis) aged between 0.92 and 18 years, and 41 IBD-free controls of
      similar age. Fecal concentration of lactoferrin was determined with a
      quantitative immunoenzymatic test. Fecal concentration of lactoferrin in children
      with IBD was significantly higher than in the controls. The cut-off value of
      fecal lactoferrin concentration optimally distinguishing between the children
      with IBD and the controls was identified as 13 mug/g. The sensitivity and
      specificity of this cut-off value equaled 80.7% and 92.7%, respectively, and its 
      positive and negative prognostic values were 96.8% and 63.3%, respectively.
      Patients diagnosed with moderate Crohn's disease had significantly higher fecal
      concentrations of lactoferrin than children with the mild or inactive disease.
      Similarly, children with moderate ulcerative colitis showed significantly higher 
      fecal concentrations of lactoferrin than individuals with the mild condition. No 
      significant relationship was found between the fecal concentration of lactoferrin
      and the severity of endoscopic lesions. Patients with IBD and a positive result
      of fecal occult blood test were characterized by significantly higher
      concentrations of lactoferrin than the individuals with IBD and a negative result
      of this test. In conclusion, fecal concentration of lactoferrin seems to be a
      useful parameter for diagnosis and monitoring of IBD in children.

TI  - The gut microbiota and host health: a new clinical frontier.
PG  - 330-9
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2015-309990 [doi]
AB  - Over the last 10-15 years, our understanding of the composition and functions of 
      the human gut microbiota has increased exponentially. To a large extent, this has
      been due to new 'omic' technologies that have facilitated large-scale analysis of
      the genetic and metabolic profile of this microbial community, revealing it to be
      comparable in influence to a new organ in the body and offering the possibility
      of a new route for therapeutic intervention. Moreover, it might be more accurate 
      to think of it like an immune system: a collection of cells that work in unison
      with the host and that can promote health but sometimes initiate disease. This
      review gives an update on the current knowledge in the area of gut disorders, in 
      particular metabolic syndrome and obesity-related disease, liver disease, IBD and
      colorectal cancer. The potential of manipulating the gut microbiota in these
      disorders is assessed, with an examination of the latest and most relevant
      evidence relating to antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, polyphenols and faecal 
      microbiota transplantation.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease involves 2 major disorders, ulcerative colitis and
      Crohn disease, both of which are due to inflammatory dysregulation in the
      gastrointestinal tract. Although these disorders have many overlapping features
      in pathophysiology and management, our current understanding of inflammatory
      bowel disease has illuminated several distinguishing features of the 2 diseases. 
      This article highlights similarities and differences most applicable to a primary
      care physician's practice. Also detailed are disease-related and
      treatment-related complications, and routine health maintenance practices for the
      patient with inflammatory bowel disease.

      mice: Possible mechanisms.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) encompass at least two forms of intestinal
      inflammation: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC). Both conditions are
      chronic and inflammatory disorders in the gastrointestinal tract, with an
      increasing prevalence being associated with the industrialization of nations and 
      in developing countries. Patients with these disorders are 10 to 20 times more
      likely to develop cancer of the colon. The aim of this study was to characterize 
      the effects of a naturally occurring polyphenol, gallic acid (GA), in an
      experimental murine model of UC. A significant blunting of weight loss and
      clinical symptoms was observed in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-exposed,
      GA-treated mice compared with control mice. This effect was associated with a
      remarkable amelioration of the disruption of the colonic architecture, a
      significant reduction in colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and a decrease
      in the expression of inflammatory mediators, such as inducible nitric oxide
      synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. In
      addition, GA reduced the activation and nuclear accumulation of p-STAT3(Y705),
      preventing the degradation of the inhibitory protein IkappaB and inhibiting of
      the nuclear translocation of p65-NF-kappaB in colonic mucosa. These findings
      suggest that GA exerts potentially clinically useful anti-inflammatory effects
      mediated through the suppression of p65-NF-kappaB and IL-6/p-STAT3(Y705)
      activation.

TI  - IL-33 Signaling Protects from Murine Oxazolone Colitis by Supporting Intestinal
      Epithelial Function.
PG  - 2737-46
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000532 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: IL-33, a member of the IL-1 cytokine family that signals through ST2,
      is upregulated in ulcerative colitis (UC); however, the role of IL-33 in colitis 
      remains unclear. IL-33 augments type 2 immune responses, which have been
      implicated in UC pathogenesis. We sought to determine the role of IL-33 signaling
      in oxazolone (OXA) colitis, a type 2 cytokine-mediated murine model of UC.
      METHODS: Colon mucosal IL-33 expression was compared between pediatric and adult 
      UC and non-IBD patients using immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR. OXA colitis
      was induced in WT, IL-33, and ST2 mice, and histopathology, cytokine levels, and 
      goblet cells were assessed. Transepithelial resistance was measured across
      IL-33-treated T84 cell monolayers. RESULTS: Colon mucosal IL-33 was increased in 
      pediatric patients with active UC and in OXA colitis. IL-33 and ST2 OXA mice
      exhibited increased disease severity compared with WT OXA mice. OXA induced a
      mixed mucosal cytokine response, but few differences were observed between OXA WT
      and IL-33 or ST2 mice. Goblet cells were significantly decreased in IL-33 and ST2
      OXA compared with WT OXA mice. IL-33 augmented transepithelial resistance in T84 
      cells, and this effect was blocked by the ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98,059. CONCLUSIONS:
      OXA colitis is exacerbated in IL-33 and ST2 mice. Increased mucosal IL-33 in
      human UC and murine colitis may be a homeostatic response to limit inflammation, 
      potentially through effects on epithelial barrier function. Further investigation
      of IL-33 protective mechanisms would inform the development of novel therapeutic 
      approaches.

TI  - Selecting Therapeutic Targets in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (STRIDE): Determining
      Therapeutic Goals for Treat-to-Target.
PG  - 1324-38
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2015.233 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Selecting Therapeutic Targets in Inflammatory Bowel Disease
      (STRIDE) program was initiated by the International Organization for the Study of
      Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IOIBD). It examined potential treatment targets for 
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to be used for a "treat-to-target" clinical
      management strategy using an evidence-based expert consensus process. METHODS: A 
      Steering Committee of 28 IBD specialists developed recommendations based on a
      systematic literature review and expert opinion. Consensus was gained if >/=75%
      of participants scored the recommendation as 7-10 on a 10-point rating scale
      (where 10=agree completely). RESULTS: The group agreed upon 12 recommendations
      for ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The agreed target for UC
      was clinical/patient-reported outcome (PRO) remission (defined as resolution of
      rectal bleeding and diarrhea/altered bowel habit) and endoscopic remission
      (defined as a Mayo endoscopic subscore of 0-1). Histological remission was
      considered as an adjunctive goal. Clinical/PRO remission was also agreed upon as 
      a target for CD and defined as resolution of abdominal pain and diarrhea/altered 
      bowel habit; and endoscopic remission, defined as resolution of ulceration at
      ileocolonoscopy, or resolution of findings of inflammation on cross-sectional
      imaging in patients who cannot be adequately assessed with ileocolonoscopy.
      Biomarker remission (normal C-reactive protein (CRP) and calprotectin) was
      considered as an adjunctive target. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence- and consensus-based
      recommendations for selecting the goals for treat-to-target strategies in
      patients with IBD are made available. Prospective studies are needed to determine
      how these targets will change disease course and patients' quality of life.

TI  - Mucosa-associated Faecalibacterium prausnitzii phylotype richness is reduced in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 7582-92
LID - 10.1128/AEM.02006-15 [doi]
AB  - Faecalibacterium prausnitzii depletion in intestinal diseases has been
      extensively reported, but little is known about intraspecies variability. This
      work aims to determine if subjects with gastrointestinal disease host
      mucosa-associated F. prausnitzii populations different from those hosted by
      healthy individuals. A new species-specific PCR-denaturing gradient gel
      electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) method targeting the 16S rRNA gene was developed to
      fingerprint F. prausnitzii populations in biopsy specimens from 31 healthy
      control (H) subjects and 36 Crohn's disease (CD), 23 ulcerative colitis (UC), 6
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and 22 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. The
      richness of F. prausnitzii subtypes was lower in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      patients than in H subjects. The most prevalent operational taxonomic units
      (OTUs) consisted of four phylotypes (OTUs with a 99% 16S rRNA gene sequence
      similarity [OTU99]), which were shared by all groups of patients. Their
      distribution and the presence of some disease-specific F. prausnitzii phylotypes 
      allowed us to differentiate the populations in IBD and CRC patients from that in 
      H subjects. At the level of a minimum similarity of 97% (OTU97), two phylogroups 
      accounted for 98% of the sequences. Phylogroup I was found in 87% of H subjects
      but in under 50% of IBD patients (P = 0.003). In contrast, phylogroup II was
      detected in >75% of IBD patients and in only 52% of H subjects (P = 0.005). This 
      study reveals that even though the main members of the F. prausnitzii population 
      are present in both H subjects and individuals with gut diseases, richness is
      reduced in the latter and an altered phylotype distribution exists between
      diseases. This approach may serve as a basis for addressing the suitability of F.
      prausnitzii phylotypes to be quantified as a putative biomarker of disease and
      depicting the importance of the loss of these subtypes in disease pathogenesis.

TI  - Prevalence and Risk Factors for Functional Vitamin B12 Deficiency in Patients
      with Crohn's Disease.
PG  - 2839-47
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000559 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is a risk factor for vitamin B12 deficiency due 
      to frequent involvement of the terminal ileum. Conventional screening for B12
      deficiency with serum B12 is relatively insensitive and measures total B12
      concentration, of which a minority is present in a biologically active form.
      Holotranscobalamin (holoTC) combined with methylmalonic acid (MMA) is believed to
      be more accurate in identifying impaired B12 status. We evaluated the prevalence 
      and risk factors for B12 deficiency using holoTC supported by MMA among patients 
      with CD. METHODS: We performed a single-center service evaluation of 381 patients
      with CD who underwent B12 assessment (holoTC/MMA) and compared them with 141
      patients with ulcerative colitis. Eighty-nine patients with CD underwent paired
      serum B12 and holoTC. Among patients with CD, risk factors including terminal
      ileal resection length, ileal inflammation on endoscopy, and disease
      characteristics on magnetic resonance imaging were recorded. RESULTS: Prevalence 
      of B12 deficiency among patients with CD was 33% compared with 16% in ulcerative 
      colitis (P < 0.0001). In 89 patients who underwent paired tests, conventional
      testing identified B12 deficiency in 5% of patients with CD, which increased to
      32% using holoTC/MMA. Independent risk factors for B12 deficiency were ileal
      resection length </=20 cm (odds ratio: 3.0, 95% confidence interval, 1.5-6.0, P =
      0.002) and >20 cm (odds ratio: 6.7, 95% confidence interval, 3.0-14.7, P <
      0.0001) and ileal inflammation (odds ratio: 3.9, 95% confidence interval,
      2.2-6.9, P < 0.0001). On magnetic resonance imaging, active terminal ileal
      inflammation (P = 0.02) and an increased disease burden (>/=1 skip lesion, P =
      0.01 and prestenotic dilatation >3 cm, P = 0.01) were associated with B12
      deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin B12 deficiency is common in patients with CD.
      holoTC supported by MMA identifies patients with B12 deficiency considered
      replete on conventional testing.

TI  - Patterns of Antibiotic Exposure and Clinical Disease Activity in Inflammatory
      Bowel Disease: A 4-year Prospective Study.
PG  - 2576-82
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000534 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial treatment is known to cause short- and long-term
      changes in the composition of normal human microbiota. The relationship between
      antibiotic use and overall clinical behavior in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) 
      has not been explored. We aim to prospectively characterize patterns of
      antibiotic use and clinical IBD activity in a large IBD cohort. METHODS:
      Prospective observational study from a longitudinal IBD natural history registry 
      between 2009 and 2012. Antibiotic prescriptions were identified and categorized
      using electronic medical record data. Cumulative rates over the 4-year study
      period were compared. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, health care utilization,
      and treatment data of the patients with IBD were collected and analyzed. Quality 
      of life was measured by Short IBD Questionnaire data. Primary outcomes were
      markers of disease activity including Short IBD Questionnaire scores, C-reactive 
      protein levels, health care utilization, and medication use. RESULTS: Seven
      hundred eighteen patients followed over 4 years were included (47.6% male; mean
      age, 46.7 +/- 15.2 yr), 59.9% had Crohn's disease, whereas 38.6% had ulcerative
      colitis. Most patients (66.3%) were exposed to antibiotics during the study
      period. Antibiotic-exposed patients were more likely to have Crohn's disease (63%
      versus 53.7%; P = 0.05), require narcotics (43.7% versus 14.9%; P < 0.0001),
      receive antidepressants (43.1% versus 18.6%; P < 0.001), prednisone (52.7% versus
      31%; P < 0.0001), or biological therapy (52% versus 36.5%; P < 0.0001).
      Antibiotic-exposed patients had a lower mean Short IBD Questionnaire (50.2 +/-
      11.5 versus 56.4 +/- 9.5; P < 0.0001), higher rates of C-reactive protein
      elevation (49.2% versus 31.8%; P < 0.0001), and higher health care utilization
      compared with nonantibiotic-exposed patients. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of
      patients with IBD receive antibiotic treatment, and these individuals demonstrate
      a more severe clinical course.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Post-operative recurrence is frequent in Crohn's disease.
      Genetic factors associated with post-operative recurrence remain poorly
      understood. Identification of genetic variants associated with repeat surgery
      would allow risk stratification of patients who may benefit from early aggressive
      therapy and/or post-operative prophylactic treatment. METHODS: Crohn's disease
      patients who had at least one bowel resection were retrospectively identified
      from the "Nancy IBD cohort". Covariates and potential interactions were assessed 
      using the Cox proportional hazard model. Kaplan-Meier curves for time to surgical
      recurrence were developed for 200 genetic variants and analyzed with the log-rank
      test. RESULTS: 137 patients had at least 1 resection in our cohort: 38 had a
      surgical recurrence (28%). In multivariate analysis, current smoker status (OR
      6.97, 95% CI 1.85-26.22, p=0.004), post-operative complications after prior
      surgery (OR 2.72, 95% CI 1.02-7.22, p=0.044), and Caspase recruitment
      domain-containing protein 8 (CARD8) homozygosity for the risk allele (OR 7.56,
      95% CI 1.13-50.37, p=0.036) remained significantly and independently associated
      with surgical recurrence. CONCLUSION: Current smoker status was associated with
      increased risk of surgical recurrence. A novel association between CARD8 and
      increased risk of surgical recurrence in Crohn's disease was observed. CARD8
      could be a new marker for risk stratification and prevention of recurrent
      surgery.

TI  - Characterization of genetic loci that affect susceptibility to inflammatory bowel
      diseases in African Americans.
PG  - 1575-1586
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2015.07.065 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has familial aggregation in
      African Americans (AAs), but little is known about the molecular genetic
      susceptibility. Mapping studies using the Immunochip genotyping array expand the 
      number of susceptibility loci for IBD in Caucasians to 163, but the contribution 
      of the 163 loci and European admixture to IBD risk in AAs is unclear. We
      performed a genetic mapping study using the Immunochip to determine whether IBD
      susceptibility loci in Caucasians also affect risk in AAs and identify new
      associated loci. METHODS: We recruited AAs with IBD and without IBD (controls)
      from 34 IBD centers in the United States; additional controls were collected from
      4 other Immunochip studies. Association and admixture loci were mapped for 1088
      patients with Crohn's disease, 361 with ulcerative colitis, 62 with IBD type
      unknown, and 1797 controls; 130,241 autosomal single-nucleotide polymorphisms
      (SNPs) were analyzed. RESULTS: The strongest associations were observed between
      ulcerative colitis and HLA rs9271366 (P = 7.5 x 10(-6)), Crohn's disease and
      5p13.1 rs4286721 (P = 3.5 x 10(-6)), and IBD and KAT2A rs730086 (P = 2.3 x
      10(-6)). Additional suggestive associations (P < 4.2 x 10(-5)) were observed
      between Crohn's disease and IBD and African-specific SNPs in STAT5A and STAT3;
      between IBD and SNPs in IL23R, IL12B, and C2orf43; and between ulcerative colitis
      and SNPs near HDAC11 and near LINC00994. The latter 3 loci have not been
      previously associated with IBD, but require replication. Established Caucasian
      associations were replicated in AAs (P < 3.1 x 10(-4)) at NOD2, IL23R, 5p15.3,
      and IKZF3. Significant admixture (P < 3.9 x 10(-4)) was observed for
      17q12-17q21.31 (IZKF3 through STAT3), 10q11.23-10q21.2, 15q22.2-15q23, and
      16p12.2-16p12.1. Network analyses showed significant enrichment (false discovery 
      rate <1 x 10(-5)) in genes that encode members of the JAK-STAT, cytokine, and
      chemokine signaling pathways, as well those involved in pathogenesis of measles. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In a genetic analysis of 3308 AA IBD cases and controls, we found
      that many variants associated with IBD in Caucasians also showed association
      evidence with these diseases in AAs; we also found evidence for variants and loci
      not previously associated with IBD. The complex genetic factors that determine
      risk for or protection against IBD in different populations require further
      study.

      Prevalence and Associations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Liver enzymes (LEs) abnormalities associated with pediatric
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are understudied. We undertook to describe the 
      development and associations of abnormal LEs in pediatric IBD. METHODS: We
      ascertained a cohort of 300 children with IBD and collected retrospective data. A
      Kaplan-Meier analysis determined the time to development of different thresholds 
      of abnormal LEs. Associations between clinical variables and the development of
      abnormal LEs were determined. RESULTS: The probability of developing the first
      episode of abnormal LEs above the upper limit of normal (ULN) within 150 months
      was 58.1% (16.3% by 1 mo post-IBD diagnosis). There was a 6% prevalence of
      primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) or autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis (ASC)
      in this cohort. Of those diagnosed with PSC/ASC, 93% had persistent LE elevations
      at a threshold of >2x ULN, while those without PSC/ASC had a 4% probability of
      this abnormality. Elevated gamma glutamyltranspeptidase levels of 252 U/L had a
      99% sensitivity and 71% specificity for PSC/ASC in IBD. After exclusion of
      patients with PSC/ASC, corticosteroids, antibiotics, and exclusive enteral
      nutrition demonstrated strongly positive associations with the first development 
      of abnormal LEs >ULN (hazard ratio 2.1 [95% confidence interval, 1.3-3.3], hazard
      ratio 5.6 [95% confidence interval, 3.6-8.9], hazard ratio 4.2 [95% confidence
      interval, 1.6-11.3], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal LEs are common in
      pediatric IBD and occur early. PSC/ASC is associated with persistently high LEs
      and gamma glutamyltranspeptidase levels >252 U/L. Children with IBD are at risk
      of elevated LEs if they require medications other than 5-ASA to induce IBD
      remission.

AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) belongs to inflammatory bowel disorders, a group of
      gastrointestinal disorders that can produce serious recurring diarrhea in
      affected patients. The mechanism for UC- and inflammatory bowel
      disorder-associated diarrhea is not well understood. The cystic fibrosis
      transmembrane-conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel plays an important
      role in fluid and water transport across the intestinal mucosa. CFTR channel
      function is regulated in a compartmentalized manner through the formation of
      CFTR-containing macromolecular complexes at the plasma membrane. In this study,
      we demonstrate the involvement of a novel macromolecular signaling pathway that
      causes diarrhea in UC. We found that a nitric oxide-producing enzyme, inducible
      nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), is overexpressed under the plasma membrane and
      generates compartmentalized cGMP in gut epithelia in UC. The scaffolding protein 
      Na(+)/H(+) exchanger regulatory factor 2 (NHERF2) bridges iNOS with CFTR, forming
      CFTR-NHERF2-iNOS macromolecular complexes that potentiate CFTR channel function
      via the nitric oxide-cGMP pathway under inflammatory conditions both in vitro and
      in vivo. Potential disruption of these complexes in Nherf2(-/-) mice may render
      them more resistant to CFTR-mediated secretory diarrhea than Nherf2(+/+) mice in 
      murine colitis models. Our study provides insight into the mechanism of
      pathophysiologic occurrence of diarrhea in UC and suggests that targeting CFTR
      and CFTR-containing macromolecular complexes will ameliorate diarrheal symptoms
      and improve conditions associated with inflammatory bowel disorders.

TI  - Perioperative Parenteral Nutrition in Adults With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A
      Review of the Literature.
PG  - 159-70
LID - 10.1177/0884533615594011 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory condition with
      numerous nutrition implications, including an increased risk of malnutrition and 
      various nutrient deficiencies. Surgical interventions are often necessary in the 
      treatment of IBD, and patients with IBD presenting for surgery often have
      multiple issues, including acute inflammatory processes, malnutrition, anemia,
      and infections, which may increase the likelihood of poor surgical outcomes.
      Thus, determining adjunctive treatments that may decrease postoperative
      complications is paramount. Although enteral nutrition (EN) is considered the
      preferred nutrition support modality when the gastrointestinal tract is
      accessible and functional, parenteral nutrition (PN) may provide a suitable
      alternative when the use of EN is not feasible. The aim of this review is to
      evaluate the currently available literature on the impact of perioperative PN on 
      postoperative complications, disease severity, and nutrition status in adults
      with IBD. Six studies within the past 10 years investigated this topic and are
      analyzed here. Results indicate general trends toward improvements in
      postoperative outcomes, disease severity, and nutrition status associated with
      perioperative PN use. Although results appear promising, additional, larger
      studies with an emphasis on PN composition will improve our understanding of the 
      benefits of perioperative PN in adults with IBD.

TI  - Impact of Obesity on the Management and Clinical Course of Patients with
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
PG  - 2857-63
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000560 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity has been linked with a proinflammatory state and the
      development of inflammatory diseases. Data on the clinical course and treatment
      of obese patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are limited. We used an
      institutional IBD registry to investigate the impact of obesity on IBD severity
      and treatment. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively
      collected data for 3 years (2009-2011). Patients with IBD were categorized by
      body mass index (BMI). IBD-related quality of life, biochemical markers of
      inflammation, comorbidities, health care utilization, and treatment were
      characterized. Obesity was defined as a BMI >/=30 (type I: 30-34.9, type II:
      35-39.9, and type III >/=40). RESULTS: Among 1494 patients with IBD, 71.9% were
      above their ideal BMI and 31.5% were obese. Obesity was more common in ulcerative
      colitis compared with patients with Crohn's disease (P = 0.04). Obese class II
      and class III patients were predominantly female. Obesity in IBD was associated
      with female gender (P < 0.0001), diabetes mellitus (P < 0.001), hypertension (P <
      0.001), hyperlipidemia (P < 0.001), poor quality of life (P < 0.0001), and
      increased rates of C-reactive protein elevation (P = 0.008). In logistic
      regression analysis, quality of life and C-reactive protein elevation were not
      independently correlated with obesity. There was no association between
      increasing BMI and annual prednisone use, emergency department visits,
      hospitalization, and surgery. Obesity was associated with lower milligrams per
      kilogram doses of purine analogs and biologics. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity in IBD is
      not associated with increased health care utilization and IBD-related surgeries. 
      Optimal regimens for drug dosing in obese patients with IBD have yet to be
      defined.

TI  - High School Diet and Risk of Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis.
PG  - 2311-9
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000501 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diet may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's
      disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC); yet, there are few prospective studies 
      of dietary factors. None have examined the association between adolescent diet
      and risk of inflammatory bowel diseases (CD and UC). METHODS: This study included
      women enrolled in Nurses' Health Study II who completed a validated high school
      dietary questionnaire in 1998. We examined the effect of dietary patterns
      (prudent or Western diet) and individual components of each patterns. We
      documented incident cases of CD and UC through 2011 based on physician review of 
      medical records and used Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for
      confounders to estimate hazard ratios and confidence intervals for CD and UC.
      RESULTS: Over 763,229 person-years of follow-up, we identified 70 incident cases 
      of CD and 103 cases of UC. Compared with women in the lowest quartile of a
      prudent diet score (characterized by greater intake of fruits, vegetables, and
      fish), women in the highest quartile had a 53% lower risk of CD (hazard ratio,
      0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.23-0.98; P trend = 0.04). Specifically, greater 
      intake of fish (P trend = 0.01) and fiber (P trend = 0.06) were associated with
      lower risk of CD. In contrast, Western diet score was not associated with risk of
      CD. Neither dietary patterns nor individual food or nutrient groups was
      associated with UC. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent diet is associated with risk of CD,
      but not UC, offering insights into disease pathogenesis.

TI  - Dietary intake of inulin-type fructans in active and inactive Crohn's disease and
      healthy controls: a case-control study.
PG  - 1024-31
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv136 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Prebiotic inulin-type fructans are widely consumed in the
      diet and may have contrasting effects in Crohn's disease by stimulating gut
      microbiota and/or by generating functional gastrointestinal symptoms. The aim of 
      this study was to measure fructan and oligofructose intakes in patients with
      active and inactive Crohn's disease compared with healthy controls. METHODS:
      Patients with active Crohn's disease (n = 98), inactive Crohn's (n = 99) and
      healthy controls (n = 106) were recruited to a case-control study. Dietary intake
      of inulin-type fructans was measured using a specific food frequency
      questionnaire and was compared between the three groups and between patients with
      different disease phenotypes (Montreal classification). Associations between
      intakes and disease activity (Harvey-Bradshaw Index, HBI) were also undertaken.
      RESULTS: Patients with active Crohn's disease had lower fructan intakes (median
      2.9 g/d, interquartile range [IQR] 1.8) than those with inactive Crohn's (3.6
      g/d, 2.1, p = 0.036) or controls (3.9 g/d, 2.1, p = 0.003) and lower
      oligofructose intakes (2.8 g/d, 1.8) than those with inactive Crohn's (3.5 g/d,
      2.2, p = 0.048) or controls (3.8 g/d, 2.1, p = 0.003). There were no differences 
      in intakes related to disease site or behaviour. There were negative correlations
      between HBI well-being score and fructan intake (rho = -0.154, p = 0.03) and
      oligofructose intake (rho = -0.156, p = 0.028) and for the HBI abdominal pain
      score and fructan (rho = -0.164, p = 0.021) and oligofructose intake (rho =
      -0.157, p = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with active Crohn's disease consume
      lower quantities of fructans and oligofructose than their inactive counterparts
      and healthy controls. The impact of lower intakes of prebiotic fructans on gut
      microbiota is unknown and warrants further research.

TI  - Ergosterol peroxide from Chaga mushroom (Inonotus obliquus) exhibits anti-cancer 
      activity by down-regulation of the beta-catenin pathway in colorectal cancer.
PG  - 303-12
LID - 10.1016/j.jep.2015.07.030 [doi]
LID - S0378-8741(15)30047-7 [pii]
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: In this study, we examined the effect of different fractions
      and components of Chaga mushroom (Inonotus Obliquus) on viability and apoptosis
      of colon cancer cells. Among them, one component showed the most effective growth
      inhibition and was identified as ergosterol peroxide by NMR analysis. We
      investigated the anti-proliferative and apoptosis mechanisms of ergosterol
      peroxide associated with its anti-cancer activities in human colorectal cancer
      (CRC) cell lines and tested its anti-tumor effect on colitis-induced CRC
      developed by Azoxymethane (AOM)/Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in a mouse model.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used MTT
      (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assays, flow
      cytometry assays, Western blot analysis, colony formation assays, reverse
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and
      AOM/DSS mouse models to study the molecular mechanism of metastatic activities in
      CRC cells. RESULTS: Ergosterol peroxide inhibited cell proliferation and also
      suppressed clonogenic colony formation in HCT116, HT-29, SW620 and DLD-1 CRC cell
      lines. The growth inhibition observed in these CRC cell lines was the result of
      apoptosis, which was confirmed by FACS analysis and Western blotting. Ergosterol 
      peroxide inhibited the nuclear levels of beta-catenin, which ultimately resulted 
      in reduced transcription of c-Myc, cyclin D1, and CDK-8. Ergosterol peroxide
      administration showed a tendency to suppress tumor growth in the colon of
      AOM/DSS-treated mice, and quantification of the IHC staining showed a dramatic
      decrease in the Ki67-positive staining and an increase in the TUNEL staining of
      colonic epithelial cells in AOM/DSS-treated mice by ergosterol peroxide for both 
      prevention and therapy. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that ergosterol peroxide
      suppresses the proliferation of CRC cell lines and effectively inhibits
      colitis-associated colon cancer in AOM/DSS-treated mice. Ergosterol peroxide
      down-regulated beta-catenin signaling, which exerted anti-proliferative and
      pro-apoptotic activities in CRC cells. These properties of ergosterol peroxide
      advocate its use as a supplement in colon cancer chemoprevention.

AB  - The gastrointestinal (GI) tract provides an intriguing organ for considering the 
      eosinophil's role in health and disease. The normal GI tract, except for the
      esophagus, is populated by eosinophils that are present throughout the mucosa,
      raising the possibility that eosinophils participate in innate mechanisms of
      defense. However, data from clinical studies associates increased numbers of
      eosinophils with inflammatory GI diseases, prompting concerns that eosinophils
      may have a deleterious effect on the gut. We present clinical features of 4
      disease processes that have been associated with eosinophilia and suggest areas
      requiring investigation as to their clinical significance and scientific
      relevance.

TI  - Serum Proteome Profiles in Stricturing Crohn's Disease: A Pilot Study.
PG  - 1935-41
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000445 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is a form of inflammatory bowel disease with
      different described behaviors, including stricture. At present, there are no
      laboratory studies that can differentiate stricturing CD from other phenotypes of
      inflammatory bowel disease. We performed a pilot study to examine differences in 
      the proteome among patients with stricturing CD, nonstricturing CD, and
      ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Serum samples were selected from the Ocean State
      Crohn's and Colitis Area Registry, an established cohort of patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease. Patients with CD with surgically resected stricture
      were matched with similar patients with CD without known stricture and with
      ulcerative colitis. Serum samples from each patient were digested and analyzed
      using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to characterize the proteome.
      Statistical analyses were performed to identify peptides and proteins that can
      differentiate CD with stricture. RESULTS: Samples from 9 patients in each group
      (27 total patients) were analyzed. Baseline demographic characteristics were
      similar among the 3 groups. We quantified 7668 peptides and 897 proteins for
      analysis. Receiver operating characteristic analysis identified a subset of
      peptides with an area under the curve greater than 0.9, indicating greater
      separation potential. Partial least squares discriminant analysis was able to
      distinguish among the three groups with up to 70% accuracy by peptides and up to 
      80% accuracy by proteins. We identified the significantly different proteins and 
      peptides and determined their function based on previously published literature. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The serum of patients with stricturing CD, nonstricturing CD, and
      ulcerative colitis is distinguishable through proteomic analysis. Some of the
      proteins that differentiate the stricturing phenotype have been implicated in
      complement activation, fibrinolytic pathways, and lymphocyte adhesion.

TI  - Disease Outcome of Ulcerative Colitis in an Era of Changing Treatment Strategies:
      Results from the Dutch Population-Based IBDSL Cohort.
PG  - 837-45
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv129 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In the past decades, treatment options and strategies for
      ulcerative colitis [UC] have radically changed. Whether these developments have
      altered the disease outcome at population level is yet unknown. Therefore, we
      evaluated the disease outcome of UC over the past two decades in the
      South-Limburg area of The Netherlands. METHODS: In the Dutch population-based
      IBDSL cohort, three time cohorts were defined: cohort 1991-1997 [cohort A],
      cohort 1998-2005 [cohort B], and cohort 2006-2010 [cohort C]. The colectomy and
      hospitalisation rates were compared between cohorts by Kaplan-Meier survival
      analyses. Hazard ratios [HR] for early colectomy [within 6 months after
      diagnosis], late colectomy [beyond 6 months after diagnosis], and hospitalisation
      were calculated using Cox regression models. RESULTS: In total, 476 UC patients
      were included in cohort A, 587 patients in cohort B, and 598 patients in cohort
      C. Over time, an increase in the use of immunomodulators [8.1%, 22.8% and 21.7%, 
      respectively, p < 0.01] and biological agents [0%, 4.3% and 10.6%, respectively, 
      p < 0.01] was observed. The early colectomy rate decreased from 1.5% in cohort A 
      to 0.5% in cohort B [HR 0.14; 95% confidence interval 0.04-0.47], with no further
      decrease in cohort C [0.3%, HR 0.98; 95% confidence interval 0.20-4.85]. Late
      colectomy rate remained unchanged over time [4.0% vs 5.2% vs 3.6%, respectively, 
      p = 0.54]. Hospitalisation rate was also similar among cohorts [22.3% vs 19.5% vs
      18.3%, respectively, p = 0.10]. CONCLUSION: Over the past two decades, a
      reduction in early colectomy rate was observed, with no further reduction in the 
      most recent era. Late colectomy rate and hospitalisation rate remained unchanged 
      over time.

PG  - 2383-92
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000495 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are the major forms 
      of inflammatory bowel disease, and pathogenesis involves a complex interplay
      among genetic, environmental, and immunological factors. We evaluated isoform
      expression of the IL-12-activated transcription factor STAT4 in children with CD 
      and UC. METHODS: We collected biopsy samples from both patients newly diagnosed
      with CD and with UC. We further collected blood samples from patients newly
      diagnosed with CD and with UC as well as from patients who had a flare-up after
      being in clinical remission, and we examined the ratios of STAT4beta/STAT4alpha
      mRNA. In addition to STAT4 isoforms, we measured the expression of the cytokines 
      TNFalpha, IFNgamma, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, and IL-17
      using polymerase chain reaction of biopsy samples and multiplex analysis of
      patient serum samples. RESULTS: Ratios of STAT4beta/STAT4alpha were increased in 
      specific gastrointestinal tract segments in both patients with CD and those with 
      UC that correlate with the location and severity of inflammation. In contrast, we
      did not observe changes in STAT4beta/STAT4alpha ratios in biopsy specimens from
      patients with eosinophilic esophagitis. We also observed increased
      STAT4beta/STAT4alpha ratios in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients
      with UC and those with CD, compared with healthy controls. Ratios were normalized
      after patients were treated with steroids. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these data 
      indicate that STAT4 isoforms could be an important noninvasive biomarker in the
      diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and that expression of
      these isoforms might provide further insight into the pathogenesis of IBD.

TI  - Pediatric IBD-unclassified Is Less Common than Previously Reported; Results of an
      8-Year Audit of the EUROKIDS Registry.
PG  - 2145-53

AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease-unclassified (IBD-U) is diagnosed in
      approximately 10% of pediatric and adolescent onset IBD patients. The EUROKIDS
      registry (2004) initiated by the Porto IBD working group of ESPGHAN prospectively
      monitors diagnostic workup of newly diagnosed pediatric and adolescent onset IBD 
      patients. We aimed to describe diagnostic workup, phenotype, and change of
      diagnosis over time in pediatric IBD-U patients. METHODS: Data were collected on 
      children from 52 centers across 20 European countries and Israel, diagnosed with 
      IBD from May 2005 through November 2013. Full endoscopy plus small bowel
      radiology was considered complete diagnostic workup. Participating centers
      reporting IBD-U patients were queried in 2014 for follow-up data. RESULTS: IBD-U 
      was the provisional first diagnosis in 265 of 3461 children (7.7%) (91/158 [58%] 
      with pancolitis; 140 [53%] male), diagnosed more frequently under the age of 10
      (median age 12.3 years, 89 [34%] under 10 years). Half (48%) had undergone
      complete diagnostic workup. Lack of small bowel radiology was the prevailing
      reason for incomplete workup. As a result of reinvestigations (endoscopy in 54%, 
      radiology in 38%) during a median follow-up of 5.7 years (interquartile range,
      2.5-7.8), a change in diagnosis from IBD-U to Crohn's disease (12%) or ulcerative
      colitis (20%) was reported. CONCLUSIONS: Only half of patients reported as IBD-U 
      in EUROKIDS had undergone complete diagnostic workup. Follow-up with
      reinvestigations resulted in a reduction of IBD-U rate to 5.6%. A diagnosis of
      IBD-U becomes less likely in case of complete diagnostic workup. Implementation
      of clear diagnostic criteria will further reduce the rate of IBD-U in the future.

TI  - The association of autoimmune diseases with pediatric ulcerative colitis does not
      influence its disease course.
PG  - 33-40
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2015.1058415 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory condition. Previous 
      reports suggested that UC may have a worse prognosis when associated with
      auto-immune diseases. We compared characteristics at diagnosis and natural
      history of the disease between classical ulcerative colitis (CUC) and UC
      associated with auto-immune diseases (CAI) in children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 
      this study, 67 children followed for UC at Nancy University Hospital between 1993
      and 2012 were included: 45 patients in the CUC group and 22 in the CAI group.
      RESULTS: Median follow-up was 4.8 years. Median age at diagnosis was 11.6 years
      in the CAI group and 9.8 years in the CUC group. Time between symptoms onset and 
      diagnosis was broadly similar in the two groups (<3 months) and there were no
      significant differences regarding biological and histological findings. At 5
      years, the need for corticosteroids and azathioprine did not differ between the
      CAI and the CUC groups. There was also no significant difference between the two 
      groups regarding infliximab use at 1 and 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: In this pediatric 
      study, CAI had similar characteristics at baseline as CUC. The course of CAI does
      not seem to be influenced by the presence of concomitant auto-immune diseases.

TI  - Impact of Crohn's Disease on Marital Quality of Life: A Preliminary
      Cross-Sectional Study.
PG  - 873-80
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv121 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Quality of marriage exerts a great effect on quality of life
      [QOL] and health outcomes. Few data are available on the effects of Crohn's
      disease [CD] on quality of marriage. We aimed to clarify whether and how CD
      affected the marital relationship. METHODS: Web-based questionnaires were created
      including an ENRICH marital inventory, a general QOL survey [SF12], a short
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire [SIBDQ] and a modified Harvey-Bradshaw
      Index [HBI]. Married patients were enrolled through the outpatient registration
      system and diverse social media websites. Controls were subsequently enrolled and
      matched with the ratio of 1:1 through invitation emails and internet advertising.
      RESULTS: A total of 243 patients completed valid questionnaires and then 243
      matched individuals were enrolled. Male patients were more affected, representing
      a significantly reduced total marital score. CD impaired the dimensions of
      idealistic distortion and marital satisfaction in both genders. There were
      correlations between quality of marriage, SF12, SIBDQ and HBI. Mental scale of
      SF12 correlated best with the marital relationship, indicating more significant
      involvement of mental adjustment. Multiple linear regression demonstrated that
      spouse's educational background, duration of marriage from disease onset, enteral
      nutrition, hospitalisation in past 12 months, and number of previous
      hospitalisations, independently impacted on quality of marriage. CONCLUSIONS:
      Certain aspects of the marital relationship were impaired in CD patients,
      especially in male subjects. In addition to medication, mental interventions
      should be given attention to improve the marriage of CD patients. Despite some
      novel findings in this study, this research orientation deserves more attention.

TI  - Lamina propria macrophage phenotypes in relation to Escherichia coli in Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 75
LID - 10.1186/s12876-015-0305-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Abnormal handling of E. coli by lamina propria (LP) macrophages may
      contribute to Crohn's disease (CD) pathogenesis. We aimed to determine LP
      macrophage phenotypes in CD, ulcerative colitis (UC) and healthy controls (HC),
      and in CD, to compare macrophage phenotypes according to E. coli carriage.
      METHODS: Mucosal biopsies were taken from 35 patients with CD, 9 with UC and 18
      HCs. Laser capture microdissection was used to isolate E. coli-laden and unladen 
      LP macrophages from ileal or colonic biopsies. From these macrophages, mRNA was
      extracted and cytokine and activation marker expression measured using RT-qPCR.
      RESULTS: E. coli-laden LP macrophages were identified commonly in mucosal
      biopsies from CD patients (25/35, 71 %), rarely in UC (1/9, 11 %) and not at all 
      in healthy controls (0/18). LP macrophage cytokine mRNA expression was greater in
      CD and UC than healthy controls. In CD, E. coli-laden macrophages expressed high 
      IL-10 & CD163 and lower TNFalpha, IL-23 & iNOS irrespective of macroscopic
      inflammation. In inflamed tissue, E. coli-unladen macrophages expressed high
      TNFalpha, IL-23 & iNOS and lower IL-10 & CD163. In uninflamed tissue, unladen
      macrophages had low cytokine mRNA expression, closer to that of healthy controls.
      CONCLUSION: In CD, intra-macrophage E. coli are commonly found and LP macrophages
      express characteristic cytokine mRNA profiles according to E. coli carriage.
      Persistence of E. coli within LP macrophages may provide a stimulus for chronic
      inflammation.

AB  - Prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins (PHDs) control cellular adaptation to hypoxia.
      PHDs are found involved in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, the exact
      role of PHD3, a member of the PHD family, in IBD remains unknown. We show here
      that PHD3 plays a critical role in maintaining intestinal epithelial barrier
      function. We found that genetic ablation of Phd3 in intestinal epithelial cells
      led to spontaneous colitis in mice. Deletion of PHD3 decreases the level of tight
      junction protein occludin, leading to a failure of intestinal epithelial barrier 
      function. Further studies indicate that PHD3 stabilizes occludin by preventing
      the interaction between the E3 ligase Itch and occludin, in a
      hydroxylase-independent manner. Examination of biopsy of human ulcerative colitis
      patients indicates that PHD3 is decreased with disease severity, indicating that 
      PHD3 down-regulation is associated with progression of this disease. We show that
      PHD3 protects intestinal epithelial barrier function and reveal a
      hydroxylase-independent function of PHD3 in stabilizing occludin. These findings 
      may help open avenues for developing a therapeutic strategy for IBD.

TI  - GPx2 Induction Is Mediated Through STAT Transcription Factors During Acute
      Colitis.
PG  - 2078-89
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000464 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The selenoprotein glutathione peroxidase 2 (GPx2) is highly expressed
      in the gastrointestinal epithelium. During inflammatory bowel disease and
      colorectal cancer, GPx2 expression is enhanced. METHODS: We analyzed GPx2
      expression and transcriptional regulation during the different phases of dextran 
      sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice and in cytokine-treated colorectal
      cancer cells. RESULTS: In the colon of DSS-treated mice, GPx2 was upregulated
      during the acute and recovery phase. In the latter, it was specifically localized
      in regenerating ki67-positive crypts next to ulcerations. In cultured cells,
      endogenous GPx2 expression and GPx2 promoter activity were enhanced by the
      anti-inflammatory mediators 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) and
      interleukin-22 (IL-22), while it was unaffected by classical proinflammatory
      cytokines like IL-1beta. Induction of GPx2 expression by 15d-PGJ2 was mediated
      through Nrf2. In contrast, in DSS-treated Nrf2-KO mice GPx2 expression remained
      upregulated during recovery, which appeared to be independent of Nrf2. IL-22
      activates transcription factors of the signal transducers and activators of
      transcription (STAT) family. Therefore, we analyzed the GPx2 promoter for
      putative STAT-responsive elements and identified 4 of them. Point mutation of the
      binding element next to the transcription start completely abolished promoter
      activation after IL-22 treatment and after cotransfection of STAT expression
      plasmids. To show in vivo relevance of the obtained results, we performed
      immunohistochemistry for phospho-STAT3 and GPx2. Especially during acute colitis,
      GPx2 and nuclear STAT3 colocalized in inflamed areas. CONCLUSIONS: GPx2 is a
      novel target of STAT transcription factors. The upregulation of GPx2 by IL-22
      indicates that GPx2 might be important for the resolution of inflammation.

TI  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli infection has donor-dependent effect on human 
      gut microbiota and may be antagonized by probiotic yeast during interaction with 
      Peyer's patches.
PG  - 9097-110
LID - 10.1007/s00253-015-6704-0 [doi]
AB  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) are major food-borne pathogens
      responsible for serious infections ranging from mild diarrhea to hemorrhagic
      colitis and life-threatening complications. Shiga toxins (Stxs) are the main
      virulence factor of EHEC. The antagonistic effect of a prophylactic treatment
      with the probiotic strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae against EHEC O157:H7 was
      investigated using complementary in vitro human colonic model and in vivo murine 
      ileal loop assays. In vitro, the probiotic treatment had no effect on O157:H7
      survival but favorably influenced gut microbiota activity through modulation of
      short-chain fatty acid production, increasing acetate production and decreasing
      that of butyrate. Both pathogen and probiotic strains had individual-dependent
      effects on human gut microbiota. For the first time, stx expression was followed 
      in human colonic environment: at 9 and 12 h post EHEC infection, probiotic
      treatment significantly decreased stx mRNA levels. Besides, in murine ileal
      loops, the probiotic yeast specifically exerted a trophic effect on intestinal
      mucosa and inhibited O157:H7 interactions with Peyer's patches and subsequent
      hemorrhagic lesions. Taken together, the results suggest that S. cerevisiae may
      be useful in the fight against EHEC infection and that host associated factors
      such as microbiota could influence clinical evolution of EHEC infection and the
      effectiveness of probiotics.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which primarily includes Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis, involves chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. 
      The mechanisms of IBD pathogenesis are not well understood at this time, but
      likely involve an interaction between genetic, gut microbial, immune, and
      environmental factors. Emerging epidemiologic studies have suggested a
      relationship between specific dietary nutrients as an environmental factor and
      IBD risk. Clinical trials have also shown oral diets to have variable efficacy in
      affecting clinical outcomes for IBD. This review discusses the key studies that
      evaluated the use of various oral diets as well as nutrition support in the
      management of IBD.

TI  - Fungal Signature in the Gut Microbiota of Pediatric Patients With Inflammatory
      Bowel Disease.
PG  - 1948-56
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000454 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves dysregulation of mucosal
      immunity in response to environmental factors such as the gut microbiota. The
      bacterial microbiota is often altered in IBD, but the connection to disease is
      not fully clarified and gut fungi have recently been suggested to play a role as 
      well. In this study, we compared microbes from all 3 domains of life-bacteria,
      archaea, and eukaryota-in pediatric patients with IBD and healthy controls.
      METHODS: A stool sample was collected from patients with IBD (n = 32) or healthy 
      control subjects (n = 90), and bacterial, archaeal, and fungal communities were
      characterized by deep sequencing of rRNA gene segments specific to each domain.
      RESULTS: Patients with IBD (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) had lower
      bacterial diversity and distinctive fungal communities. Two lineages annotating
      as Candida were significantly more abundant in patients with IBD (P = 0.0034 and 
      P = 0.00038, respectively), whereas a lineage annotating as Cladosporium was more
      abundant in healthy subjects (P = 0.0025). There were no statistically
      significant differences in archaea, which were rare in pediatric samples compared
      with those from adults. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric IBD is associated with reduced
      diversity in both fungal and bacterial gut microbiota. Specific Candida taxa were
      found to be increased in abundance in the IBD samples. These data emphasize the
      potential importance of fungal microbiota signatures as biomarkers of pediatric
      IBD, supporting their possible role in disease pathogenesis.

TI  - The severity of inflammation at onset of ulcerative colitis is not associated
      with IBS-like symptoms during clinical remission.
PG  - 776-83
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv107 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Symptoms compatible with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are 
      common in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) in clinical remission. It has
      been suggested that these symptoms might arise due to post-inflammatory changes
      comparable with post-infectious IBS. The aim was to study factors at new onset of
      UC that predict development of IBS-like symptoms during clinical remission.
      METHODS: In total, 98 patients with new onset of UC were followed prospectively
      for 3 years with yearly follow-up visits. Data from the first visit at the onset 
      of UC were compared between a group of patients who fulfilled the criteria for
      IBS while in remission (UCR+IBS) during follow-up and a group who did not
      (UCR-IBS). RESULTS: Among the UC patients, 87 met the criteria for clinical
      remission and 25 (29%) of these reported IBS-like symptoms in remission during
      follow-up. There was no difference in inflammatory disease activity at the
      initial flare or in the prevalence of previous IBS symptoms when comparing
      UCR+IBS and UCR-IBS patients. The UCR+IBS patients reported more severe
      gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal pain, during their primary flare. 
      CONCLUSION: The severity and extent of inflammation at onset of UC do not seem to
      affect the development of IBS-like symptoms in UC patients during clinical
      remission. The high prevalence of IBS-like symptoms is not explained by
      pre-existing IBS. UCR+IBS patients reported more severe gastrointestinal symptoms
      at disease onset, which might indicate a more sensitive gastrointestinal tract in
      this category of patients.

TI  - Toward enteral nutrition for the treatment of pediatric Crohn disease in Canada: 
      a workshop to identify barriers and enablers.
PG  - 351-6
LID - 16819 [pii]
AB  - The treatment armamentarium in pediatric Crohn disease (CD) is very similar to
      adult-onset CD with the notable exception of the use of exclusive enteral
      nutrition (EEN [the administration of a liquid formula diet while excluding
      normal diet]), which is used more frequently by pediatric gastroenterologists to 
      induce remission. In pediatric CD, EEN is now recommended by the pediatric
      committee of the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation and the European
      Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition as a
      first-choice agent to induce remission, with remission rates in pediatric studies
      consistently >75%. To chart and address enablers and barriers of use of EEN in
      Canada, a workshop was held in September 2014 in Toronto (Ontario), inviting
      pediatric gastroenterologists, nurses and dietitians from most Canadian pediatric
      IBD centres as well as international faculty from the United States and Europe
      with particular research and clinical expertise in the dietary management of
      pediatric CD. Workshop participants ranked the exclusivity of enteral nutrition; 
      the health care resources; and cost implications as the top three barriers to its
      use. Conversely, key enablers mentioned included: standardization and sharing of 
      protocols for use of enteral nutrition; ensuring sufficient dietetic resources;
      and reducing the cost of EEN to the family (including advocacy for reimbursement 
      by provincial ministries of health and private insurance companies). Herein, the 
      authors report on the discussions during this workshop and list strategies to
      enhance the use of EEN as a treatment option in the treatment of pediatric CD in 
      Canada.

TI  - Identification of a common variant with potential pleiotropic effect on risk of
      inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer.
PG  - 999-1007
LID - 10.1093/carcin/bgv086 [doi]
AB  - Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have separately identified many
      genetic susceptibility loci for ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD) and
      colorectal cancer (CRC), there has been no large-scale examination for
      pleiotropy, or shared genetic susceptibility, for these conditions. We used
      logistic regression modeling to examine the associations of 181 UC and CD
      susceptibility variants previously identified by GWAS with risk of CRC using data
      from the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium and the Colon 
      Cancer Family Registry. We also examined associations of significant variants
      with clinical and molecular characteristics in a subset of the studies. Among
      11794 CRC cases and 14190 controls, rs11676348, the susceptibility single
      nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) for UC, was significantly associated with reduced
      risk of CRC (P = 7E-05). The multivariate-adjusted odds ratio of CRC with each
      copy of the T allele was 0.93 (95% CI 0.89-0.96). The association of the SNP with
      risk of CRC differed according to mucinous histological features (P heterogeneity
      = 0.008). In addition, the (T) allele was associated with lower risk of tumors
      with Crohn's-like reaction but not tumors without such immune infiltrate (P
      heterogeneity = 0.02) and microsatellite instability-high (MSI-high) but not
      microsatellite stable or MSI-low tumors (P heterogeneity = 0.03). The minor
      allele (T) in SNP rs11676348, located downstream from CXCR2 that has been
      implicated in CRC progression, is associated with a lower risk of CRC,
      particularly tumors with a mucinous component, Crohn's-like reaction and
      MSI-high. Our findings offer the promise of risk stratification of inflammatory
      bowel disease patients for complications such as CRC.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Association of Signal transducers and activators of transcription-4
      (STAT4) gene polymorphism with susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease have 
      been investigated in a number of epidemiological studies, but the results are
      inclusive. The aim of this meta-analysis was to more precisely estimate the
      relationship. METHODS: The databases of Pubmed and CBM updated to October, 2014
      were retrieved. Random- or fixed-effect model was used to estimate odd radio (OR)
      and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95%CI) on the basis of heterogeneity. 
      RESULTS: Seven articles containing 2196 Crohn's disease (CD) cases, 1588
      ulcerative colitis (UC) cases and 4126 controls were identified. We detected a
      significant association between STAT4 rs7574865 polymorphism and IBD
      susceptibility in overall population (GG vs. GT+TT, OR=0.855, 95% CI=0.760-0.962,
      P=0.009), but not in Caucasian and Asian population, respectively. No association
      was detected between rs7574865 polymorphism and CD susceptibility in overall,
      Asian and Caucasian population, respectively. Interestingly, a significant
      association was detected between rs7574865 with UC susceptibility in overall
      population (G vs. T, OR=0.881, 95% CI=0.798-0.972, P=0.012; GG vs. GT+TT,
      OR=0.788, 95% CI=0.679-0.914, P=0.002; GG vs. TT, OR=0.683, 95% CI=0.498-0.937,
      P=0.018) and Caucasians (GG vs. GT+TT, OR=0.833, 95% CI=0.701-0.990, P=0.038;
      GG+GT vs. TT, OR=0.667, 95% CI=0.456-0.975, P=0.037; GG vs. TT, OR=0.636, 95%
      CI=0.433-0.934, P=0.021), respectively, and a possible association was found in
      Asian population (GG vs. GT+TT, OR=0.709, 95% CI=0.503-0.998, P=0.049).
      CONCLUSIONS: STAT4 rs7574865 gene is IBD risk factor, and this gene polymorphism 
      is associated with UC susceptibility, especially in Caucasians. To confirm these 
      findings, further studies with more sample size are required for a definitive
      conclusion.

TI  - Use of Acid Suppression Medication is Associated With Risk for C. difficile
      Infection in Infants and Children: A Population-based Study.
PG  - 912-7
LID - 10.1093/cid/civ432 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acid suppression medication is associated with Clostridium difficile 
      infection (CDI) in adults and is increasingly prescribed to children. This study 
      evaluated the relationship between acid suppression medication and incident CDI
      in children. METHODS: This was a population-based, nested case-control study.
      Patients were eligible if they were aged 0-17 years with 3 or more visits or 1
      year or more of follow-up in the dataset. Patients were excluded if they had
      comorbidities that associate with CDI and might also associate with acid
      suppression medication. Patients with codes for CDI were matched 1:5 with control
      patients by age, sex, medical practice, time of entry into the dataset, and
      follow-up time. The primary exposure was use of acid suppression medication with 
      proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) within 
      8-90 days. RESULTS: We identified 650 CDI cases and 3200 controls. The adjusted
      odds ratio (OR) for CDI and acid suppression medication was 7.66 (95% confidence 
      interval [CI], 3.24-18.1). Acid suppression medication was associated with CDI in
      infants aged <1 year (OR, 5.24; 95% CI, 1.13-24.4) and children aged 1-17 years
      (OR, 9.33; 95% CI, 3.25-26.8). There was increased risk for CDI with PPIs
      compared with H2RAs and with recent compared with distant exposure. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Acid suppression medication associated with CDI in infants and children in the
      outpatient setting, with an effect based on medication timing. Increased risk for
      CDI should be factored into the decision to use acid suppression medication in
      children.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between
      25-hydroxy vitamin D (25[OH]D) and markers of vitamin D status in inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case-control study of 
      59 pediatric patients with IBD (age 16.4 +/- 2.2 y) and 116 controls (age 14.6
      +/- 4.4 y), to investigate the association between 25(OH)D and albuminemia for
      protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) and hepatic dysfunction; alanine transaminase
      (ALT) for hepatic inflammation; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) for
      intestinal inflammation; body mass index (BMI) for adiposity; seasons and skin
      pigmentation for insolation. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as 25(OH)D < 50
      nmol/L; abnormal liver enzyme by ALT >40 U/L; overweight status by BMI of >/=85th
      but <95th percentile, and obesity by BMI >/=95th percentile. Seasons were
      categorized as summer, winter, spring, and fall. RESULTS: Patients with IBD had a
      higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (42.4% versus 26.7%; P = 0.04),
      elevated ALT (16.9% versus 2.6%; P < 0.001), and lower albumin (41.1 +/- 4.8
      versus 45.1 +/- 3.8; P < 0.001) than controls. In both the IBD cohort and
      controls, 25(OH)D was highest in summer and lowest in winter, and significantly
      higher in white than in non-white patients. ESR varied significantly with 25(OH)D
      (R(2) = 0.24; beta = -0.32; P = 0.010), and only patients with IBD with elevated 
      ESR had lower 25(OH)D than controls (49.5 +/- 25.2 versus 65.3 +/- 28.0 nmol/L; P
      = 0.045). CONCLUSION: Intestinal inflammation, not the loss of albumin-bound
      vitamin D in the gut, is the primary intestinal determinant of vitamin D status
      in IBD. The extraintestinal determinants are seasons and skin pigmentation, but
      not adiposity and hepatic inflammation.

AB  - Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders are a heterogeneous group of disorders
      characterized by no specific digestive symptoms associated with dense
      eosinophilic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract in the absence of known
      causes for such tissue eosinophilia. Among these diseases, eosinophilic
      gastroenteritis (EGE) and colitis (EC) are less common than esophagitis, but
      their incidence and prevalence have been increasing over the past decade due in
      part to increased disease recognition. The exact pathophysiology is not clear:
      EGE and EC are immune-mediated diseases implicating adaptive T-helper cell type 2
      immunity. According to the site of eosinophilic infiltration, there is a wide
      spectrum of digestive symptoms ranging from food refusal, nausea, vomiting,
      abdominal pain, weight loss, gastrointestinal bleeding (anemia), protein loosing 
      enteropathy, ascites, bowel obstruction or perforation for EGE and diarrhea +/-
      bleeding for CE. Endoscopic lesions are not specific: friability, erythematous
      mucosa with superficial erosions, or ulceration is often observed.
      Histologically, markedly increased numbers of mucosal eosinophils are seen in
      biopsy specimens. However, no standards for the diagnosis of EGE or CE exist and 
      few findings support the diagnosis: intraepithelial eosinophils, eosinophil crypt
      abscesses, and eosinophils in muscularis mucosa and/or submucosa. Other organs
      are not involved. The other causes of tissue eosinophilia (infections,
      inflammatory bowel diseases) should be excluded. Food allergy appears to play a
      central role in driving inflammation in EGE and CE, as evidenced by symptomatic
      improvement with initiation of food exclusion or elemental diets. Dietary
      treatment should be the first therapeutic option in children. If the elimination 
      diet fails, corticosteroids are currently the best characterized treatment but
      appropriate duration is unknown and relapses are frequent. In severe forms,
      immunomodulators or biologic agents (anti-IL5, anti-IgE, or anti-TNFa) can
      potentially play a role in the treatment of EGE and CE.

TI  - Systematic review: Body composition in children with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 142-57
LID - 10.1111/apt.13218 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Paediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with weight
      loss, growth restriction and malnutrition. Bone mass deficits are well described,
      little is known about other body composition compartments. AIMS: To define the
      alterations in non-bone tissue compartments in children with IBD, and explore the
      effects of demographic and disease parameters. METHODS: A systematic search was
      carried out in the PubMed (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) and Web of Science
      databases in May 2014 (limitations age <17 years, and composition measurements
      compared with a defined control population). RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were
      included in this systematic review, reporting on a total of 1479 children with
      IBD [1123 Crohn's disease, 243 ulcerative colitis], pooled mean age 13.1 +/- 3.2 
      years, and 34.9% female. Data were highly heterogeneous, in terms of methodology 
      and patients. Deficits in protein-related compartments were reported. Lean mass
      deficits were documented in 93.6% of Crohn's disease and 47.7% of ulcerative
      colitis patients when compared with healthy control populations. Lower lean mass 
      was common to both sexes in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, deficits in
      females with persisted for longer. Fat-related compartment findings were
      inconsistent, some studies report reductions in body fat in new diagnosis/active 
      Crohn's disease. CONCLUSIONS: It is clear that almost all children with Crohn's
      disease and half with ulcerative colitis have reduced lean mass, however, body
      fat alterations are not well defined. To understand what impact this may have on 
      health and disease in children with IBD, further studies are needed to identify
      in which tissues these deficits lie, and to quantify body fat and its
      distribution.

TI  - Food Intolerance: Immune Activation Through Diet-associated Stimuli in Chronic
      Disease.
PG  - 42-52
AB  - The immune response is a very complex interplay of specific and nonspecific
      branches that have evolved to distinguish between nondangerous and dangerous or
      nontolerated factors. In the past, research has focused on the specific immune
      system much more than the host's innate defense. Studies have shown that a key
      component of the immune response involves activation of the inflammasome. A
      direct relationship between the presence of the inflammasome and the onset of
      disease has already been characterized for a variety of chronic and food-related 
      diseases, including arthrosclerosis, metabolic syndrome, and chronic bowel
      diseases, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The leukocyte
      activation (ALCAT test), an immunological blood test for food intolerance
      reactions, is ideal to identify and eliminate individual food stimuli that may
      act as triggers for the cellular nonspecific immune response. Although the test
      is not diagnostic, studies have established that it can be a useful screening
      tool for the identification of foreign substances that may trigger immune cell
      activation, particularly of neutrophils, leading to inflammatory disorders. The
      ALCAT test, coupled with a targeted diet that is individually tailored according 
      to the test's results, may support immune homeostasis and provide a valuable
      complementary approach for therapy and overall health.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Colonic strictures complicate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      and often lead to surgical resection to prevent dysplasia or cancer. We assessed 
      the frequency of dysplasia and cancer among IBD patients undergoing resection of 
      a colorectal stricture. METHODS: We analyzed data from the Groupe d'etudes et
      therapeutiques des affections inflammatoires du tube digestif study. This was a
      nationwide retrospective study of 12,013 patients with IBD in France who
      underwent surgery for strictures at 16 centers from August 1992 through January
      2014 (293 patients for a colonic stricture, 248 patients with Crohn's disease,
      51% male, median age at stricture diagnosis of 38 years). Participants had no
      preoperative evidence of dysplasia or cancer. We collected clinical, endoscopic, 
      surgical, and pathology data and information on outcomes. RESULTS: When patients 
      were diagnosed with strictures, they had IBD for a median time of 8 years (3-14).
      The strictures were a median length of 6 cm (4-10) and caused symptoms in 70% of 
      patients. Of patients with Crohn's disease, 3 (1%) were found to have low-grade
      dysplasia, 1 (0.4%) was found to have high-grade dysplasia, and 2 (0.8%) were
      found to have cancer. Of patients with ulcerative colitis, 1 (2%) had low-grade
      dysplasia, 1 (2%) had high-grade dysplasia, and 2 (5%) had cancer. All patients
      with dysplasia or cancer received curative surgery, except 1 who died of
      colorectal cancer during the follow-up period. No active disease at time of
      surgery was the only factor associated with dysplasia or cancer at the stricture 
      site (odds ratio, 4.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-21.27; P = .036).
      CONCLUSIONS: In a retrospective study of patients with IBD undergoing surgery for
      colonic strictures, 3.5% were found to have dysplasia or cancer. These findings
      can be used to guide management of patients with IBD and colonic strictures.

TI  - Use of Intravenous Immunoglobulin for Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease
      with Contraindications or Who Are Unresponsive to Conventional Treatments.
PG  - 1854-9
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000456 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Managing patients with IBD who are refractory or have
      contraindications to standard therapies is challenging. Many will lose response, 
      become intolerant to treatment, or develop infections with contraindication for
      immunosuppression. Therefore, alternative therapies, such as the use of
      intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), could be used to manage patients in these
      difficult cases. METHODS: Data were extracted retrospectively from the electronic
      medical records at Vanderbilt University on patients with IBD who received IVIg
      (February 2011-June 2013). Patients were treated with IVIg 0.4 g.kg.d for 3
      consecutive days and then 0.4 g/kg once monthly. The dose was increased to 0.4
      g/kg biweekly for loss of response or partial response. Clinical response was
      defined as decreasing the Harvey-Bradshaw Index >/=3 points or improvement in
      C-reactive protein >25%. Clinical remission was defined as Harvey-Bradshaw Index 
      score <5, no hospitalizations or surgeries after IVIg, or symptom resolution.
      Statistical analysis was performed using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. RESULTS:
      Twenty-four patients with IBD received IVIg. Seventeen patients received IVIg for
      failure of standard treatment. Six patients received IVIg during active
      infection. Two patients had histoplasmosis, 1 patient had tuberculosis, and 2
      patients had pulmonary fungal infections. One patient with ulcerative colitis was
      given IVIg for recurrent Clostridium difficile. Nine patients required dose
      escalation after median 153 days (30-360). Ninteen patients (79%) had a response 
      or remission. Sixteen (67%) had a response and 3 (12.5%) obtained remission with 
      IVIg. C-reactive protein decreased significantly after treatment (19 mg/dL
      [0.1-77] to 7.5 [0.2-20]), P < 0.05. Harvey-Bradshaw Index scores improved (8
      [0-19] to 6 [0-17]), P = not significant. Of note, 62.5% had endoscopic
      improvement after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: IVIg is safe and effective in the
      short-term management of patients with IBD when standard therapies are
      contraindicated.

TI  - Assessing fatigue in inflammatory bowel disease: comparison of three fatigue
      scales.
PG  - 203-11
LID - 10.1111/apt.13255 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fatigue is commonly reported by patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD), both in quiescent and active disease. Few fatigue scales have been
      tested in IBD. AIM: To assess three fatigue assessment scales in IBD and to
      determine correlates of fatigue. METHODS: Potential participants (n = 2131) were 
      randomly selected from an IBD organisation's members' database; 605 volunteered
      and were posted three fatigue scales: Inflammatory Bowel Disease Fatigue scale,
      Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory and Multidimensional Assessment Fatigue scale 
      and questionnaires assessing anxiety, depression, quality of life (QoL) and IBD
      activity. The questionnaires were tested for stability over time with another
      group (n = 70) of invited participants. Internal consistency was measured by
      Cronbach's alpha and test-retest reliability by the intraclass correlation
      coefficient (ICC). RESULTS: Four hundred and sixty-five of 605 (77%)
      questionnaires were returned; of 70 invited, 48/70 returned test (68.6%) and
      41/70 (58.6%) returned retest. The three scales are highly correlated (P <
      0.001). Test-retest suggests reasonable agreement with ICC values between 0.65
      and 0.84. Lower age, female gender, IBD diagnosis, anxiety, depression and QoL
      were associated with fatigue (P < 0.001) on univariable analysis. However, on
      multivariable analysis only depression and low QoL were consistently associated
      with fatigue, while female gender was associated on most scales. IBD diagnosis,
      age and other factors were not consistently associated with severity or impact of
      fatigue once other variables were controlled for. CONCLUSIONS: All three fatigue 
      scales are likely to measure IBD fatigue adequately. Responsiveness to change has
      not been tested. Depression, poorer QoL and probably female gender are the major 
      associations of fatigue in IBD.

TI  - Dietary fatty acid intakes are related to the risk of ulcerative colitis: a
      case-control study.
PG  - 1255-60
LID - 10.1007/s00384-015-2232-8 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The role of dietary fatty acids in ulcerative colitis (UC)
      pathogenesis has been shown in animal models; however, human studies are rare. We
      hypothesized that there might be a relationship between dietary fatty acid
      composition and the risk of developing incident UC. MATERIAL AND METHODS:
      Overall, 62 new cases of UC and 124 healthy age and sex-matched controls were
      studied. Information on usual diet was measured by a validated country-specific
      food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Logistic regression analysis adjusting for
      potential confounding variables was carried out to compare dietary fatty acid
      intakes between cases and controls. RESULTS: We found positive associations
      between dietary intake of total fat (P value for trend <0.01), oleic acid (P
      value for trend <0.01), saturated fatty acid (SAFA) (P value for trend = 0.02),
      total polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) (P value for trend = 0.04), and trans fat
      (P value for trend <0.01). CONCLUSION: Our results showed that higher
      consumptions of total fats, oleic acid, SAFAs, total PUFAs, trans fat, MUFAs, and
      linoleic acid are significantly associated with increased risk for UC; however,
      no statistically significant associations were detected between the risk of
      disease and n-3 PUFAs and cholesterol intake.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the presentation, therapeutic management, and long-term
      outcome of children with very early-onset (VEO) (</= 5 years of age) inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD). STUDY DESIGN: Data were obtained from an inception cohort of
      1928 children with IBD enrolled in a prospective observational registry at
      multiple centers in North America. RESULTS: One hundred twelve children were </= 
      5 years of age with no child enrolled at <1 year of age. Of those, 42.9% had
      Crohn's disease (CD), 46.4% ulcerative colitis (UC), and 10.7% had
      IBD-unclassified. Among the children with CD, children 1-5 years of age had more 
      isolated colonic disease (39.6%) compared with 6- to 10-year-olds (25.3%, P =
      .04), and 11- to 16-year-olds (22.3%, P < .01). The change from a presenting
      colon-only phenotype to ileocolonic began at 6-10 years. Children 1-5 years of
      age with CD had milder disease activity (45.8%) at diagnosis compared with the
      oldest group (28%, P = .01). Five years postdiagnosis, there was no difference in
      disease activity among the 3 groups. However, compared with the oldest group, a
      greater proportion of 1- to 5-year-olds with CD were receiving corticosteroids (P
      < .01) and methotrexate (P < .01), and a greater proportion of 1- to 5-year-olds 
      with UC were receiving mesalamine (P < .0001) and thiopurine immunomodulators (P 
      < .0002). CONCLUSIONS: Children with VEO-CD are more likely to have mild disease 
      at diagnosis and present with a colonic phenotype with change to an ileocolonic
      phenotype noted at 6-10 years of age. Five years after diagnosis, children with
      VEO-CD and VEO-UC are more likely to have been administered corticosteroids and
      immunomodulators despite similar disease activity in all age groups. This may
      suggest development of a more aggressive disease phenotype over time.

TI  - Successful Mercaptopurine Usage despite Azathioprine-Induced Pancreatitis in
      Paediatric Crohn's Disease.
PG  - 676-9
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv086 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Azathioprine [AZA] and mercaptopurine [MP] are recommended for
      maintenance of steroid-free remission in children with Crohn`s disease [CD].
      Azathioprine-induced pancreatitis, an idiosyncratic and major side effect, has
      been considered as an absolute contraindication for the use of a second
      thiopurine in IBD patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We describe two children with 
      CD in whom MP were successfully trialled after a confirmed azathioprine-induced
      pancreatitis, being well tolerated in both cases. RESULTS: Two boys [13 and 10
      years old] started exclusive enteral nutrition after diagnosis of moderate
      (Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index [wPCDAI] = 45) and mild [wPCDAI = 35]
      CD. Both developed an acute mild to moderate pancreatitis after 2 and 3 weeks,
      respectively, of AZA treatment but recovered fully in hospital after AZA
      withdrawal. They started on MP treatment without any adverse effect. They were
      tested for the presence of polymorphisms 238G>C, 460G>A, and 719A>G in the TPMT
      gene and 94C>A and 21>C in the ITPase. Both patients were wild-type for all
      tested polymorphisms. CONCLUSIONS: Azathioprine-induced acute pancreatitis should
      not be considered as an absolute contraindication for the use of MP. Further
      investigation is required to create a better understanding of the mechanism
      underlying the adverse events and to allow more possibilities for personalised
      therapy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and functional abdominal pain (FAP)
      are associated with debilitating symptoms and frequent medical visits that may
      disrupt school functioning. The aim of this study was to assess school-related
      quality of life and school absenteeism in children with IBD, compared with FAP
      and healthy controls. METHODS: School absenteeism and participation in school and
      after-school activities data were obtained for 43 children with Crohn disease
      (CD), 31 children with ulcerative colitis (UC), 42 children with FAP, and 30
      age-matched healthy controls for the 2013-2014 school year. We used a
      semistructured questionnaire for both children and parents. For diminishing
      recall bias, absenteeism data were cross-matched with the patient's school annual
      report cards. RESULTS: Children with FAP, CD, and UC missed significantly more
      school days than age-matched healthy controls (17.6 [8.75-30], 24 [14-30], and 21
      [12-25] vs 5.1 [3.75-6.25], respectively, P < 0.001). Compared with children with
      FAP, absenteeism because of medical appointments and hospitalization was
      significantly greater in children with CD and UC (8.8 [4-14] and 7.1 [3-10] vs
      4.4 [2-6.25], P = 0.001). Participation of children with FAP and IBD in various
      school and after-school activities was significantly reduced compared with
      healthy controls. There was no difference in school attendance and functioning
      between children with IBD and FAP. CONCLUSIONS: FAP has a significant impact on
      school attendance and functioning similar to IBD. These findings show that
      significant psychosocial and academic difficulties are faced not only by children
      with chronic diseases like IBD but also by children with FAP.

PG  - 1587-93
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000417 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents are an important component of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treatment, but data on their influence on
      anemia, a frequent complication of IBD, are limited. The aim of this study was to
      evaluate the effect of anti-TNF agents on hemoglobin (Hb) levels in a large IBD
      cohort. METHODS: Prospectively collected demographic, clinical, laboratory, and
      treatment data from IBD patients who started anti-TNF treatment at a tertiary
      referral center during the years 2010 to 2012 were analyzed. Follow-up data
      including disease activity scores (Harvey-Bradshaw index or ulcerative colitis
      activity index), quality of life scores (short IBD questionnaire) completed at
      each visit, and laboratory data were analyzed. Data from the year of anti-TNF
      initiation (yr 0) to the following year (yr 1) were compared. RESULTS: A total of
      430 IBD patients (324 with Crohn's disease, 51.6% females) started anti-TNF
      treatment. The prevalence of anemia and median Hb levels did not change between
      years 0 and 1. Median short IBD questionnaire was significantly improved at year 
      1 (P = 0.002). IBD patients with anemia had significantly higher median Hb levels
      at year 1 compared with year 0 (P = 0.0009). Hematopoietic response (increase of 
      Hb >/=2 g/dL) was observed in only 33.6% of the 134 anemic IBD patients, despite 
      iron replacement being administered in 126 anemic patients (oral, 77%).
      Improvement in Hb levels was independently significantly correlated with change
      of C-reactive protein levels (P = 0.04) and immunomodulator use (P = 0.03).
      CONCLUSIONS: Anemia remains a significant manifestation of IBD 1 year after
      treatment with anti-TNF agents.

TI  - Interleukin 6 Increases Production of Cytokines by Colonic Innate Lymphoid Cells 
      in Mice and Patients With Chronic Intestinal Inflammation.

LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2015.04.017 [doi]
LID - S0016-5085(15)00573-9 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are a heterogeneous group of
      mucosal inflammatory cells that participate in chronic intestinal inflammation.
      We investigated the role of interleukin 6 (IL6) in inducing activation of ILCs in
      mice and in human beings with chronic intestinal inflammation. METHODS: ILCs were
      isolated from colons of Tbx21(-/-) x Rag2(-/-) mice (TRUC), which develop
      colitis; patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); and patients without
      colon inflammation (controls). ILCs were characterized by flow cytometry;
      cytokine production was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and
      cytokine bead arrays. Mice were given intraperitoneal injections of depleting
      (CD4, CD90), neutralizing (IL6), or control antibodies. Isolated colon tissues
      were analyzed by histology, explant organ culture, and cell culture. Bacterial
      DNA was extracted from mouse fecal samples to assess the intestinal microbiota.
      RESULTS: IL17A- and IL22-producing, natural cytotoxicity receptor-negative, ILC3 
      were the major subset of ILCs detected in colons of TRUC mice. Combinations of
      IL23 and IL1alpha induced production of cytokines by these cells, which increased
      further after administration of IL6. Antibodies against IL6 reduced colitis in
      TRUC mice without significantly affecting the structure of their intestinal
      microbiota. Addition of IL6 increased production of IL17A, IL22, and
      interferon-gamma by human intestinal CD3-negative, IL7-receptor-positive cells,
      in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: IL6 contributes to activation of colonic
      natural cytotoxicity receptor-negative, CD4-negative, ILC3s in mice with chronic 
      intestinal inflammation (TRUC mice) by increasing IL23- and IL1alpha-induced
      production of IL17A and IL22. This pathway might be targeted to treat patients
      with IBD because IL6, which is highly produced in colonic tissue by some IBD
      patients, also increased the production of IL17A, IL22, and interferon-gamma by
      cultured human colon CD3-negative, IL7-receptor-positive cells.

TI  - Interleukin 34: a new modulator of human and experimental inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 281-90
LID - 10.1042/CS20150176 [doi]
AB  - IBD (inflammatory bowel disease), where CD (Crohn's disease) and UC (ulcerative
      colitis) represent the two main forms, are chronic inflammatory conditions of the
      intestine. Macrophages play a central role in IBD pathogenesis and are regulated 
      by major differentiation factors such as CSF-1 (colony-stimulating factor 1) in
      homoeostasis and inflammation. IL (interleukin)-34 has recently been discovered
      as a second ligand for CSF-1R (CSF-1 receptor). However, expression and
      involvement of IL-34 in IBD remain unknown. In the present paper, we investigated
      the expression of IL34, CSF1 and their shared receptor CSF1R in normal human
      ileum and colon, in inflamed and non-inflamed tissues of CD and UC patients, and 
      in a mouse model of experimental colitis. We found distinct expression patterns
      of IL34 and CSF1 in ileum and colon, with higher IL34 in ileum and, in contrast, 
      higher CSF1 in colon. Furthermore, IL34 and CSF1 expression was increased with
      inflammation in IBD patients and in experimental colitis. In humans, infiltrating
      cells of the lamina propria and intestinal epithelial cells expressed IL-34, and 
      TNF-alpha (tumour necrosis factor alpha) regulated IL-34 expression in intestinal
      epithelial cells through the NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappaB) pathway. These
      data demonstrate the expression pattern of IL-34 in ileum and colon and suggest
      IL-34 as a new modulator of inflammation in IBD.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: An increasing body of evidence has linked diet to inflammatory
      bowel diseases (IBD), both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Most of our
      current knowledge pertains to the link between diet and Crohn's disease.
      Exclusive enteral nutrition and partial enteral nutrition are the best known
      dietary intervention for the induction of remission and maintenance of remission 
      in Crohn's disease both in children and in adults, but the mechanism whereby
      these interventions may cause or maintain remission and mucosal healing has
      remained elusive. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have shed light on the possible
      mechanisms of response to dietary intervention. Epidemiological and rodent model 
      studies over the last year have supplied us with several dietary candidates for
      an effect of diet on inflammation and disease pathogenesis. Others have shed
      insight into the effect of diet on dysbiosis and the microbiota. An elimination
      diet based on some of these candidates has shown clinical efficacy, and bridged
      the knowledge obtained from rodent models to a human intervention. SUMMARY: These
      studies may allow better understanding of the pathogenesis of IBD and provide new
      tools to treat these difficult diseases. Elimination diets based on the
      identification of deleterious dietary components may pave the way for an improved
      control of the disease in the future. VIDEO ABSTRACT:

TI  - Rac1 Polymorphisms and Thiopurine Efficacy in Children With Inflammatory Bowel
      Disease.
PG  - 404-7
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000820 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Thiopurines are effective for maintenance of remission in
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in only about half of patients. Predictors of
      response may assist in selecting the most appropriate patients for thiopurine
      therapy. Thiopurines inhibit Rac1, a GTPase that exerts an antiapoptotic effect
      on T-lymphocytes. A genetic association was recently demonstrated between a Rac1 
      single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and poorer response to thiopurines in adult 
      patients with Crohn disease. We aimed to determine whether Rac1 SNPs are
      associated with response to thiopurines in children with IBD. METHODS: Children
      with IBD treated with thiopurines were prospectively followed for 1 year and were
      genotyped for 3 Rac1 SNPs previously found to be relevant to IBD: rs10951982,
      rs4720672, and rs34932801. The rate of sustained steroid-free remission (SSFR)
      without treatment escalation by 12 months was compared between wild types (WTs)
      and heterozygotes. RESULTS: A total of 59 patients were studied (63% boys, 80%
      having Crohn disease, mean age 13 +/- 4.1). Nineteen of the 41 WT (46%) and 9 of 
      the 15 (60%) heterozygotes for rs10951982 were in SSFR (P = 0.55). Similarly, 21 
      of the 45 (47%) WT and 8 of the 12 (67%) heterozygotes for rs4720672 were in
      remission (P = 0.33). Finally, 21 of the 45 (47%) WT and 3 of the 5 (60%)
      heterozygotes for rs34932801 were in remission (P = 0.66). All of the 3
      comparisons remained nonsignificant in a sensitivity analysis of only the
      patients with Crohn disease. CONCLUSIONS: We did not find an association between 
      3 Rac1 SNPs and thiopurine effectiveness by 12 months in a prospective study of
      children with IBD. Other predictors of response should be sought to optimize
      patient selection for thiopurine therapy.

TI  - Probability, rate and timing of reconstructive surgery following colectomy for
      inflammatory bowel disease in Sweden: a population-based cohort study.
PG  - 882-90
LID - 10.1111/codi.12978 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Many patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) need colectomy, but the 
      rate of reconstructive surgery with restoration of intestinal continuity is
      unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the probability, rate and
      timing of reconstructive surgery after colectomy in patients with IBD in a
      population-based setting. METHOD: The study cohort included all patients with IBD
      in Sweden who underwent colectomy from 2000 to 2009. Each patient was followed
      from admission for colectomy to admission for reconstructive surgery, date of
      death, migration or 31 December 2010. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and
      multivariable Poisson regression models were used to describe the probability,
      rate and timing of reconstructive surgery. RESULTS: Out of 2818 IBD patients
      treated with colectomy, 61.0% were male and 78.9% had ulcerative colitis. No
      reconstructive surgery had been performed in 1595 (56.6%) patients by the end of 
      follow-up. Of the remaining 1223 patients, 526 underwent primary reconstructive
      surgery and 697 had a secondary reconstruction following a median interval of 357
      days from primary surgery in the form of colectomy. The probability of
      reconstructive surgery was dependent on age (55.6% and 18.1% at ages 15-29 and
      >/= 59 years, respectively), and the chance of reconstructive surgery was higher 
      in hospitals that performed more than 13 colectomies for IBD per year [incidence 
      rate ratio and 95% confidence interval 1.27 (1.09-1.49)]. CONCLUSION: Fewer than 
      half of the patients having a colectomy for IBD underwent subsequent
      reconstructive surgery. Older age and low hospital volume were risk factors for
      no reconstructive surgery.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Anemia is a common manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) that can greatly affect patients' quality of life. We performed a
      prospective study of a large cohort of patients with IBD to determine if patterns
      of anemia over time are associated with aggressive or disabling disease. METHODS:
      We performed a longitudinal analysis of demographic, clinical, laboratory, and
      treatment data from a registry of patients with IBD at the University of
      Pittsburgh Medical Center from 2009 through 2013. Patients with a complete
      follow-up evaluation (at least 1 annual visit with laboratory results) were
      included. Anemia was defined by World Health Organization criteria. Disease
      activity scores (the Harvey-Bradshaw Index or the ulcerative colitis activity
      index) and quality-of-life scores (based on the short IBD questionnaire) were
      determined at each visit; laboratory data, including levels of C-reactive protein
      and erythrocyte sedimentation rates, as well as patterns of IBD-related health
      care use, were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 410 IBD patients (245 with Crohn's
      disease, 165 with ulcerative colitis; 50.5% female) were included. The prevalence
      of anemia in patients with IBD was 37.1% in 2009 and 33.2% in 2013. Patients with
      IBD and anemia required significantly more health care and had higher indices of 
      disease activity, as well as a lower average quality of life, than patients
      without anemia (P < .0001). Anemia (persistent or recurrent) for 3 or more years 
      was correlated independently with hospitalizations (P < .01), visits to
      gastroenterology clinics (P < .001), telephone calls (P < .004), surgeries for
      IBD (P = .01), higher levels of C-reactive protein (in patients with ulcerative
      colitis, P = .001), and a higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P < .0001).
      Anemia was correlated negatively with quality-of-life scores (P < .03).
      CONCLUSIONS: Based on a longitudinal analysis of 410 patients, persistent or
      recurrent anemia correlates with more aggressive or disabling disease in patients
      with IBD.

AB  - We analyzed a national US database to study the presentation of children with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to the emergency department (ED). Our results
      indicate that from 2006 to 2010, there was a significant increase in the number
      of ED visits related to children with IBD accompanied by a contemporaneous
      decline in the rate of hospitalization that followed these ED visits. Earlier
      published results have highlighted an increased overall rate of hospitalizations 
      in the United States related to children with IBD. In this context, our results
      support the evidence for an increased prevalence of pediatric IBD in the United
      States in recent years.

TI  - Clostridium difficile ribotype 027: relationship to age, detectability of toxins 
      A or B in stool with rapid testing, severe infection, and mortality.
PG  - 233-41
LID - 10.1093/cid/civ254 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) can cause severe disease and
      death, especially in older adults. A better understanding of risk factors for
      adverse outcomes is needed. This study tests the hypotheses that infection with
      specific ribotypes and presence of stool toxins independently associate with
      severity and constructs predictive models of adverse outcomes. METHODS: Cases of 
      non-recurrent CDI were prospectively included after positive stool tests for
      toxins A and/or B by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or tcdB by polymerase chain
      reaction. Outcomes included severe CDI (intensive care unit admission, colectomy,
      or death attributable to CDI within 30 days of diagnosis) and 30-day all-cause
      mortality. Adjusted models were developed to test hypotheses and predict
      outcomes. RESULTS: In total, 1144 cases were included. The toxin EIA was positive
      in 37.2% and 35.6% of patients were of age >65 years. One of the 137 unique
      ribotypes was ribotype 027 (16.2%). Detectable stool toxin did not associate with
      outcomes. Adjusting for covariates, including age, Ribotype 027 was a significant
      predictor of severe CDI (90 cases; odds ratio [OR], 1.73; 95% confidence interval
      [CI], 1.03-2.89; P = .037) and mortality (89 cases; OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.19-3.43; 
      P = .009). Concurrent antibiotic use associated with both outcomes. Both
      multivariable predictive models had excellent performance (area under the curve
      >0.8). CONCLUSIONS: Detection of stool toxin A and/or B by EIA does not predict
      severe CDI or mortality. Infection with ribotype 027 independently predicts
      severe CDI and mortality. Use of concurrent antibiotics is a potentially
      modifiable risk factor for severe CDI.

PG  - 734-8
LID - 10.1111/ped.12577 [doi]
AB  - Neonatal transient eosinophilic colitis (NTEC) is a new disease concept within
      eosinophilic gastroenteritis, which was proposed by Ohtsuka et al. It causes
      hematochezia as a result of eosinophilia, in neonates who have not yet started to
      receive enteral nutrition, although the whole-body status of the infant is in
      fact relatively good. To date, there have been no reports of this disease in
      which abnormalities were noted during gestation, and the clinical phenomena
      surrounding it, along with any complications, are not yet clear. We encountered a
      suspected case of NTEC causing respiratory distress with aspiration of
      hematochezia, in which dilated bowel was noted during gestation. This case
      indicates that NTEC may occur at the fetal stage and be complicated by
      respiratory distress.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIM: Although inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients are at risk 
      for metabolic bone disease, studies analyzing this correlation have identified
      various risk factors, including disease phenotype, age, sex and steroid therapy. 
      Furthermore, few studies have assessed risk factors for bone loss in Japanese IBD
      patients. This study analyzed risk factors for metabolic bone disease in Japanese
      IBD patients. METHODS: This cross-sectional study assessed 388 patients with IBD 
      aged 20-50 years, including 232 with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 156 with Crohn's
      disease (CD). Bone mineral density of the femoral neck, total femur and lumbar
      spine was quantified by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The blood
      concentrations of bone metabolism markers were measured. History of smoking and
      bone fracture, and nutritional intake were assessed using questionnaires.
      RESULTS: Of the 388 patients with IBD, 78 (20.1%; UC, 17.2%; CD, 24.4%) had
      osteopenia and 17 (4.4%; UC, 3.4%; CD, 5.8%) had osteoporosis, as assessed by
      T-score. Bone mineral density of the lumbar vertebrae was lower in males than in 
      females. Multivariate regression analysis showed that risk factors for bone loss 
      in UC patients were male sex, low body mass index (BMI), high steroid dose and
      disease location. Risk factors for bone loss in CD patients were male sex and low
      BMI. CONCLUSION: Among Japanese patients with IBD, male sex and low BMI were
      associated with increased risk for metabolic bone disease. In addition, Steroid
      therapy shouldn't be indiscriminate in UC patients. These findings may help
      identify patients at particularly high risk of metabolic bone disease and may
      help implement appropriate therapies in a timely manner and improve long-term
      quality of life.

TI  - PTPN2 controls differentiation of CD4(+) T cells and limits intestinal
      inflammation and intestinal dysbiosis.
PG  - 918-29
LID - 10.1038/mi.2014.122 [doi]
AB  - Loss-of-function variants within the gene locus encoding protein tyrosine
      phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2) are associated with increased risk for
      Crohn's disease (CD). A disturbed regulation of T helper (Th) cell responses
      causing loss of tolerance against self- or commensal-derived antigens and an
      altered intestinal microbiota plays a pivotal role in CD pathogenesis. Loss of
      PTPN2 in the T-cell compartment causes enhanced induction of Th1 and Th17 cells, 
      but impaired induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in several mouse colitis
      models, namely acute and chronic dextran sodium sulfate colitis, and T-cell
      transfer colitis models. This results in increased susceptibility to intestinal
      inflammation and intestinal dysbiosis which is comparable with that observed in
      CD patients. We detected inflammatory infiltrates in liver, kidney, and skin and 
      elevated autoantibody levels indicating systemic loss of tolerance in
      PTPN2-deficient animals. CD patients featuring a loss-of-function PTPN2 variant
      exhibit enhanced Th1 and Th17 cell, but reduced Treg markers when compared with
      PTPN2 wild-type patients in serum and intestinal tissue samples. Our data
      demonstrate that dysfunction of PTPN2 results in aberrant T-cell differentiation 
      and intestinal dysbiosis similar to those observed in human CD. Our findings
      indicate a novel and crucial role for PTPN2 in chronic intestinal inflammation.

TI  - Comparing histological activity indexes in UC.
PG  - 1412-8
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2014-307477 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Assessment of disease activity in UC is important for designing an
      optimal therapeutic strategy. No single histology score is considered optimum.
      The aim of this study was to compare intraobserver reproducibility and the
      interobserver agreement of available histological UC activity indexes. METHODS:
      One hundred and two biopsy specimens (collected between 2003 and 2014) were
      scored blindly by three pathologists by determining Geboes, Riley, Gramlich and
      Gupta indexes and global visual evaluation (GVE). Intraobserver reproducibility
      and interobserver agreements for index and items of index were studied by
      intraclass correlation coefficient for quantitative parameter and by kappa values
      and Krippendorff index for qualitative parameters. Relationship between indexes
      was studied by computation of Pearson's and Spearman's correlation coefficients. 
      RESULTS: Geboes, Riley, Gramlich and Gupta indexes and GVE showed good
      intraobserver reproducibility and a good interobserver agreement. Histological
      items that showed the best interobserver agreement were 'erosion/ulceration or
      surface epithelial integrity' and 'acute inflammatory cells
      infiltrate/neutrophils in lamina propria'. The five scores were strongly
      correlated. CONCLUSIONS: Correlation between indexes is strong. Intraobserver
      reproducibility and interobserver agreement for all indexes is very good.
      Histological items that showed the best interobserver agreement are
      'erosion/ulceration' and 'acute inflammatory cells infiltrate/neutrophils in
      lamina propria'.

TI  - Variable access to quality nutrition information regarding inflammatory bowel
      disease: a survey of patients and health professionals and objective examination 
      of written information.
PG  - 2501-12
LID - 10.1111/hex.12219 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) report a range of
      nutritional and dietary problems and high-quality written information should be
      available on these. There is little research investigating the availability and
      quality of such information for patients with IBD. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed
      the type and quality of written information on nutrition and diet available to
      patients with IBD and the opinions of patients and health professionals. SETTING 
      AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-two patients with IBD were recruited from a large
      gastroenterology outpatient centre in England. One hundred dietitians from across
      the United Kingdom were also recruited. METHODS: Face-to-face surveys were
      conducted with patients with IBD. Questions regarding the use, format and
      usefulness of dietary information received were probed. Dietitians were surveyed 
      regarding written dietary information used in clinical practice. Samples of
      IBD-specific dietary information used across the UK were objectively assessed
      using two validated tools. MAIN RESULTS: The majority of patients rated written
      information as 'good' or 'very good', with the most useful information relating
      to 'general diet and IBD'. Forty-nine (49%) dietitians reported gaps in written
      information available for patients with IBD. Fifty-three different samples of
      IBD-specific information sheets were returned, with widely variable objective
      quality ratings. Commercially produced written information scored greater than
      locally produced information (BMA tool, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patient access to
      high-quality, written, IBD-specific dietary information is variable. IBD-specific
      written nutrition information needs to be developed in accordance with validated 
      tools to empower patients, encourage self-management and overcome nutritional
      implications of IBD.
