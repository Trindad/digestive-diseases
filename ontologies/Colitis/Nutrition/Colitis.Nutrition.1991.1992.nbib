AB  - Presented is a middle-aged male who developed a fulminant case of
      antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis characterized by leukocytosis,
      hypoalbuminemia, ascites, and anasarca without toxic megacolon. The patient
      responded slowly to medical therapy consisting of intravenous metronidazole, oral
      vancomycin, and parenteral nutrition. Subsequently, cholestyramine was
      administered. A review of the literature concerning similar cases of fulminant
      pseudomembranous colitis is presented.

TI  - [Enteropathy in premature newborn infants. Prospective study over one year].
PG  - 869-73
AB  - BACKGROUND: In neonatal units, there is a tendency to assume that any acutely
      sick infant with gastro-intestinal symptoms has necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). 
      This prospective study was conducted to find a better definition of enteropathy
      in preterm neonates and their risk factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All the 351
      preterm neonates admitted to a neonatal unit from 1 August 1988 to 31 July 1989
      were included in the study. A chart including 45 items was established for each
      infant, with special attention to data on the pregnancy, delivery, any early
      ischemic and/or infectious problem, nutrition and any gastro-intestinal (GI)
      problem. All the neonates were fed similarly, depending their maturation,
      gestational age and GI status. Each infant was assigned to one of 5 categories:
      1) no GI problem; 2) transient obstruction; 3) NEC with pneumatosis; 4)
      hemorrhagic colitis without obstruction or pneumatosis; 5) other GI disease.
      RESULTS: 267 infants had no GI problem during their stay in the neonatal unit. 53
      developed GI symptoms: 23 transient obstructions, 6 NEC, and 24 hemorrhagic
      colitis. The mean age at onset of symptoms in these last 3 categories was 7 days,
      14 days and 23 days, respectively. Ten risk factors were found to be
      significantly correlated with GI disturbances: umbilical venous catheter,
      benzodiazepines, birth weight < 1,500 g, patent ductus arteriosus, ventilatory
      assistance, abnormal amniotic fluid, gestational age < 32 weeks, early antibiotic
      treatment, passage of meconium > 48 hours, episodes of apnoea and/or bradycardia.
      CONCLUSION: This follow-up shows that the GI disturbances of preterm neonates
      admitted to a neonatal unit, specially those having one or more risk factors, can
      be separated into 3 groups: 1) isolated intestinal obstruction, seen in the most 
      immature babies during the first week of life with the risk of developing NEC; 2)
      frank blood in the stool, indicating colitis and possibly minor forms of NEC; 3) 
      combined obstructive and hemorrhagic symptoms, typical of NEC.

      parenteral nutrition, in a 21-year-old woman undergoing a surgical procedure for 
      long-standing chronic ulcerative colitis. She presented with high temperature and
      the illness did not respond to antibiotic therapy. A 2-dimensional echocardiogram
      showed a mobile right atrial mass that at surgery was identified as a thrombus.
      Thrombus cultures grew coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus.

AB  - 15N-Glycine constant infusion method was applied to study the changes of protein 
      metabolism after major abdominal operation and the influence of recombinant human
      growth hormone (GH). Our results showed: (1) under the support of total
      parenteral nutrition (30 cal/kg/d and 1.25 g protein/kg/d), the protein turnover 
      rate (Q), synthetic rate (S) and catabolic rate (C) all increased significantly
      (P < 0.05) with an outstriping increase of C over S on postoperative day 3 in
      comparison with that on preoperative day 3; (2) with the support of hypocaloric
      parenteral nutrition (20 cal/kg/d and 1.00 g protein/kg/d), Q, C values also
      increased significantly (P < 0.05) comparing with that of the control group on
      post operative day 7 in patients treated with one week GH (0.15 iu/kg/d), but S
      value increased more significantly (P < 0.01), which indicated that the
      postoperative use of TPN plus GH is much better than giving TPN alone.

TI  - Localized deficiencies of folic acid in aerodigestive tissues.
PG  - 87-95; discussion 95-6
AB  - The notion that requirements for folic acid may be higher in some tissues than
      others, resulting in localized deficiencies in spite of blood levels in the
      normal range was first suggested by the observation of megaloblastic changes in
      the cervical epithelium that responded to folate supplementation. Theoretically, 
      such deficiencies may arise from elevated folate turnover in response to rapid
      tissue proliferation or repair; inactivation or alteration of its function by
      external agents such as tobacco, alcohol, or drugs; or altered metabolism or
      tissue uptake caused by an inborn error. Marginal dietary intake could aggravate 
      these effects on cells at risk. Evidence for the possible existence of localized 
      folate deficiencies in the aerodigestive tract includes lower circulating folate 
      levels in smokers as compared with nonsmokers; yet lower circulating levels in
      smokers with bronchial metaplasia; lower folate levels in scrapings of the buccal
      mucosa of smokers than non-smokers; apparent improvement in bronchial atypical
      metaplasia in smokers supplemented with folic acid; lower erythrocyte folate
      levels and higher prevalence of cellular features compatible with folate
      deficiency in geographic areas and individuals in South Africa at high risk for
      esophageal cancer; and a trend toward a lower prevalence of colonic dysplasia in 
      ulcerative colitis patients who use folic acid supplements. These observations,
      as well as animal and in vitro studies, also suggest that folate deficiency may
      be co-carcinogenic. Further research in this area will be aided by the
      development of animal models of localized folate deficiency and of methodologies 
      capable of measuring folate levels in minute quantities of tissues and exfoliated
      cells.

TI  - Gastric emptying in childhood inflammatory bowel disease: nutritional and
      pathologic correlates.
PG  - 1148-53
AB  - To determine the incidence of gastric emptying abnormalities in children with
      inflammatory bowel disease, we performed dual liquid/solid-emptying studies on 25
      children with ulcerative colitis (UC) and on 45 with Crohn's disease (CD) over a 
      6-yr period. Nutritional parameters were evaluated initially and at the time of
      repeat study in those with abnormal emptying after a period of nutritional
      rehabilitation. All UC patients and 30 of 45 with CD (67%) had normal emptying of
      both liquid and solid components of the meal. Fifteen children with CD had
      delayed emptying of the solid liquid. Fourteen of these had preceding weight loss
      and one had no weight gain for 3 months prior to the study. Twelve complained of 
      upper gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, early satiety, postprandial epigastric
      pain, and anorexia), and five had evidence of growth retardation. The group
      averaged 4.8 abnormal nutritional parameters, compared with an average of 2.2 in 
      those with CD and normal gastric emptying. Twelve of the 15 with abnormal
      emptying had abnormal gastric and/or duodenal biopsies: 10 were treated with
      sulfasalazine and prednisone, whereas five were taking only sulfasalazine.
      Studies repeated 6-15 months later after establishment of weight gain by caloric 
      supplementation showed significant improvements in gastric emptying, nutritional 
      status, and disease activity for the group, despite persistence of upper
      gastrointestinal disease documented in eight patients who underwent
      reexamination.

TI  - Factors influencing first relapse in patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 12-6
AB  - To determine whether information available at time of diagnosis of Crohn's
      disease can predict initial clinical course, I followed 239 patients
      prospectively from time of diagnosis to initial relapse. The patient's sex,
      smoking habits, contraceptive usage, disease extent, and presence of granulomas
      in the first histological specimen were recorded. No association was found
      between this demographic data and the interval between onset of symptoms and
      diagnosis, the severity of symptoms at presentation, or the time to relapse. The 
      type of relapse, however, was influenced by the type of the first attack; 70% of 
      relapses were of the same type as the initial attack. Cigarette smoking was
      associated with ileocolitis (p = 0.028). There was a trend for oral contraceptive
      users to have ileocolitis, whereas the presence of granulomas in the first
      histological specimen was not associated with a specific disease distribution.
      Patients with ileocolitis had more inflammatory attacks than those with ileitis
      or colitis (p = 0.001). There was also a trend for cigarette smokers and those on
      oral contraceptives to have more inflammatory attacks, but the presence of
      granulomas had no effect on the type of relapse. There is little to assist in
      prognosis of early disease when the diagnosis of Crohn's disease is first made,

OAB - A surgeon followed 239 people diagnosed with Crohn's disease while they were
      patients at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa between 1970 and
      1988 until 1st relapse or for 10 years to determine whether risk factors of the
      disease predicts the clinical disease course. 156 (65%) had suffered from a
      relapse. The relapse type of about 70% of these cases was of the same type as the
      1st attack. Cigarette smokers were more likely to experience ileocolitis than
      nonsmokers (47% vs. 32%; p=.028). Ileocolitis was linked to an increased number
      of inflammatory attacks (47% vs. 35% for ileitis and 14% for colitis; p=.001).
      Thus the researcher concluded that cigarette smoking is linked to Crohn's disease
      and influences the underlying disease process. A nonsignificant trend existed for
      combined oral contraceptive use and increased numbers of inflammatory attacks and
      ileocolitis. Histological granulomas did not effect the relapse pattern of the
      patients. The Quetelet Index indicated that females were more likely to be
      malnourished than males (561 vs. 645; p.0001). They presented with more severe
      Crohn's disease at diagnosis. Obstruction was responsible for 40% of relapses in 
      patients with ileitis. Other than the fact that the type of attack 1st
      experienced by an individual tends to be the same as the relapse attack, this
      study did not provide physicians any additional information to help with
      prognosis of early diagnosis of Crohn's disease.

PG  - 70-3
AB  - Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) has become a useful tool in the management of
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In the past, it was felt that TPN
      would have a therapeutic role in IBD, but experience has shown that it functions 
      more as an adjunct to other therapeutic interventions. The specific roles of TPN 
      in IBD include: (1) nutritional maintenance in the short bowel syndrome, (2) TPN 
      as adjunctive therapy in jejunoileitis of Crohn's disease, (3) home TPN (HTPN) in
      Crohn's colitis, and (4) preoperative repletion of significantly depleted
      patients going to surgery. The adaptation of hospital techniques to the home
      situation has allowed patients to carry out long-term TPN therapy at home.
      Patients with IBD on HTPN are subject to the same mechanical and metabolic
      problems as are other patients on HTPN and, in addition, have a higher infection 
      rate. When carried out appropriately, however, HTPN is a valuable technique in
      the management of patients with IBD and may provide an improved quality of life.

TI  - Nutrition support in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 53-60
AB  - Many patients with the inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn's disease, or
      ulcerative colitis have significant protein-calorie malnutrition and
      micronutrient deficiencies. Factors that contribute to these nutritional deficits
      include inadequate nutrient intake, malabsorption, excessive nutrient secretion
      across the diseased gastrointestinal tract, drug-nutrient interactions, and
      increased nutrient requirements. In this review, the use of enteral and
      parenteral nutrition support as primary therapy for active Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis is discussed. Other roles for nutrition support in patients
      with inflammatory bowel disease, including preoperative nutrition support,
      nutritional treatment of intestinal fistulas and growth retardation, and home
      parenteral nutrition for gut failure, are also reviewed.

TI  - Childhood exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and the risk of ulcerative
      colitis.
PG  - 603-8
AB  - Previous reports have suggested that there may be a protective effect of active
      cigarette smoking on the risk of ulcerative colitis. Because passive smoking may 
      also have other health consequences, the authors examined the effect of exposure 
      to environmental tobacco smoke during childhood on adult risk of ulcerative
      colitis in a case-control study of 172 cases drawn in 1986-1987 from the rosters 
      of North Carolina chapters of the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America and 131
      peer-nominated neighborhood controls. Active smokers were less likely to develop 
      ulcerative colitis than were nonexposed nonsmokers (odds ratio = 0.53, 95%
      confidence interval 0.24-1.14). The risk was also decreased in passive smokers,
      i.e., those whose parents had smoked (odds ratio = 0.50, 95% confidence interval 
      0.25-1.00). Risk estimates were not related to sex, education, age at onset of
      symptoms, or year of onset of symptoms. Both active smoking in adulthood and
      passive childhood exposure to environmental tobacco smoke appear to decrease the 
      risk of ulcerative colitis. The results indicate that childhood passive smoke
      exposures can influence adult susceptibility to ulcerative colitis.

AB  - Three patients with an acute exacerbation of ulcerative colitis (a 40-year-old
      and a 31-year-old man and a 30-year-old woman) developed a protein C deficiency
      (serum protein C activity between 32 and 48%). In the two men the protein C
      deficiency was diagnosed only after the onset of severe thromboembolic
      complications (cavernous sinus thrombosis; pulmonary embolism) during heparin
      treatment. But in the woman protein C activity was measured immediately after
      hospital admission (in the knowledge of the first two cases) even before heparin 
      administration was started. All three patients received treatment with
      sulphasalazine (3 g daily) and fluocortolone (60 mg daily), as well as full
      heparinization (22,500-36,000 IU daily). Protein C activity returned to normal on
      remission of the ulcerative colitis (in one case only after subtotal colectomy). 
      These case reports show that acquired protein C deficiency can be reversed by
      rigorous treatment of the underlying disease.

AB  - Studies of body composition in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients
      demonstrated body cell mass depletion out of proportion to losses of body weight 
      or fat. The timing of death from wasting was related to the extent rather than
      the specific cause. However, some patients remain stable for indefinite periods, 
      indicating that wasting is not a constant phenomenon. The development of
      malnutrition is multifactorial and includes disorders of food intake, nutrient
      absorption and intermediary metabolism. Nutritional repletion has been
      demonstrated in several studies. The effect of treating infections that promote
      wasting was shown in a study of ganciclovir therapy for cytomegalovirus colitis, 
      in which untreated patients underwent progressive wasting whereas treated
      patients repleted body mass. Total parenteral nutrition had a variable effect
      upon body composition, with repletion occurring in patients with eating disorders
      or malabsorption syndromes and progressive depletion occurring in patients with
      serious systemic infections. Enteral nutrition also can replete body mass in AIDS
      patients without severe malabsorption. Pharmacologic stimulation of appetite also
      may lead to weight gain. The results of these studies indicate that nutritional
      support can improve nutritional status in properly selected AIDS patients.

AB  - The results of the study have shown that the nutrition of rural population is
      characterized by excessive consumption of bread and baked products, by high
      content of phosphorus, magnesium and iron, low content of animal proteins,
      vegetable oils, calcium, vitamins A, ascorbic acid and riboflavin. The incidence 
      of cardiovascular, respiratory and alimentary diseases in this group of
      population was rather high. The nutrition of students is characterized by
      excessive consumption of polysaccharides, vegetable oils, thiamine, niacin,
      ascorbic acid (in winter-spring period), and calcium. Diseases associated with
      nutrition disorders (obesity, hepatitis, cholecystitis, colitis) are most often
      recorded in this group of population.

TI  - Medical management of severe inflammatory disease of the rectum: nutritional
      aspects.
PG  - 27-41
AB  - It is clear that the nutritional state of patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease is often impaired and can be improved by the provision of nutritional
      support. Improvement in nutritional status can be achieved as effectively with
      enteral as with parenteral nutrition. Nutritional support appears to have no
      primary therapeutic effect in patients with ulcerative colitis. With regard to
      nutritional support in Crohn's disease, parenteral nutrition should be restricted
      to use as supportive rather than primary therapy. Available information now seems
      to suggest that most of the benefits of parenteral nutrition in Crohn's disease
      are related to an improvement in nutritional state rather than as primary
      therapy, and its use should be restricted to the treatment of specific
      complications of Crohn's disease, such as intestinal obstruction related to
      stricture formation or short bowel syndrome following repeated resection.
      Although some doubt exists over the efficacy of oligopeptide-containing elemental
      and polymeric enteral diets, the present evidence indicates that chemically
      defined free amino acid-containing elemental diets have primary therapeutic
      efficacy in the management of acute exacerbations of Crohn's disease. As such,
      these diets are worthy of therapeutic trial in patients with severe Crohn's
      disease involving the distal colon and rectum, particularly in those patients who
      are malnourished and who prove to be resistant to treatment with a combination of
      topical corticosteroids and 5-aminosalicylic acid-containing compounds.
      Clinicians should be aware, though, that the beneficial effects are likely to be 
      restricted to the short term, with high relapse rates by 1 year, this being
      particularly so in patients with distal Crohn's proctocolitis (Teahon et al,
      1988). Volatile fatty acid enemas clearly have potential in the management of
      patients with severe steroid-resistant proctitis. Finally, one of the most
      important observations made in recent years is the one concerning the large
      losses of nitrogen that will occur in patients with inflammatory bowel disease
      treated with corticosteroids in the absence of adequate protein intake (O'Keefe
      et al, 1989). Hopefully the days of treating patients with severe inflammatory
      bowel disease with high dose corticosteroids and a peripheral dextrose or
      dextrose-saline drip have passed into history.

TI  - Management of fulminating ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 37-41
AB  - A series of 69 patients with fulminating ulcerative colitis (UC), treated in
      1976-89, was reviewed to evaluate the lines of conservative and surgical methods 
      used. Fifty-six of the patients (81%) were operated on during the first
      hospitalization period: 33 patients (48%) underwent an emergency or urgent
      operation, and 23 (33%) received elective surgical treatment. The mortality rate 
      was 4.3%; three patients died after emergency operations. Excluding the 14
      patients who underwent immediate surgery within the first 48 hours, a significant
      difference could be observed in the response to conservative treatment with and
      without TPN: with TPN remission was achieved in 34 of 44 cases (77%), without it 
      in only two cases of 11 (18%), P less than 0.001. Proctocolectomy used as an
      emergency or urgent measure resulted in two deaths, and 93% of the patients
      showed complications, whereas subtotal colectomy with ileostomy resulted in no
      deaths and significantly fewer patients (31%) had complications, P less than
      0.001. The findings suggest that TPN and bowel rest, in addition to
      corticosteroid treatment, may be advantageous in all cases of fulminant UC. If
      this 'Oxford regimen' is insufficient, subtotal colectomy with ileostomy is the
      safest emergency operation.

TI  - [Bacterial translocation in Crohn disease].
PG  - 777-81
AB  - Bacterial translocation is the passage of viable endogenous bacteria from the
      gastrointestinal tract to mesenteric lymph nodes and other internal organs. The
      aim of this work was to study bacterial translocation in patients operated on for
      Crohn's disease. Twenty-eight patients, mean age 29 years, not having received
      any antibiotics since at least 8 days, presenting with ileal (n = 12),
      ileo-colonic (n = 14) or colonic (n = 2) Crohn's disease were studied. In 25 out 
      of 28 cases (89%) indication for surgery was strictures inducing an upper small
      bowel distension in 9 out of 25 patients. Mesenteric lymph nodes and liver
      biopsies, portal blood samples and peritoneum swabs were harvested after
      laparotomy and before gut opening. Bacterial translocation, defined as the
      presence of intestinal bacteria in at least one of the specimens, was present in 
      8 out of 28 patients. This was found in lymph nodes draining surgical territories
      in 7 out of 8 cases. Bacterial strains involved in translocation included E. coli
      (n = 5), Enterococcus (n = 3), Clostridium perfringens (n = 2), Proteus (n = 2), 
      and Bacteroides fragilis (n = 1). The rate of translocation differed neither
      according to Crohn's disease site nor with perforating or non perforating type of
      the disease. Five out of 9 patients operated on for strictures with proximal
      distension had a translocation. In conclusion, bacterial translocation was
      identified in 29% of patients operated on for Crohn's disease in this series.
      Distension of the intestine proximal to a digestive stricture could favor the
      occurrence of bacterial translocation in Crohn's disease.

TI  - Nutritional support in inflammatory bowel disease: current status and future
      directions.
PG  - 117-22
AB  - Malnutrition is a frequent occurrence in patients with acute inflammatory bowel
      disease. Total nutritional support provided either parentally (TPN) or enterally 
      (TEN) has been advocated not only as an adjunct for improving nutrition but also 
      as primary therapy. For patients with acute Crohn's disease, short-term rates of 
      remission after TEN are equivalent to TPN. Coupled with certain advantages when
      compared with TPN, including simpler administration, fewer side effects, and
      preservation of the intestinal mucosal barrier, TEN may therefore be the
      preferred route for nutrient delivery. Controlled trials indicate equivalent or
      superior efficacy when enteral polymeric diets are compared with elemental diets 
      for inducing remission in acute Crohn's disease. Moreover, when provided as an
      elemental diet, TEN is as effective as corticosteroids for achieving remission in
      acute Crohn's disease, but corticosteroids appear to be more effective than
      polymeric diets. Although the provision of nutritional support rather than bowel 
      rest is the major factor contributing to symptomatic improvement, the optimal
      nutrient composition and the precise mechanisms whereby nutritional support
      achieves clinical remission remain to be clarified. In contrast to Crohn's
      disease, nutritional support is not effective for achieving remission in patients
      with ulcerative colitis. Thus, enteral nutritional support is an effective
      therapy for the short-term management of acute Crohn's disease. Whether long-term
      remission is equivalent to treatment with drugs or surgery requires prospective
      evaluation. Future avenues of investigation also include defining the optimal
      nutrient composition and the underlying mechanisms that achieve maximal
      nutritional repletion, promote mucosal cell renewal, and potentially directly
      retard production of inflammatory mediators.

PG  - 639-43
AB  - Acute colitis occurring in patients suffering from psychiatric illnesses is
      believed to be linked to the intake of psychotropes. From 1983 to 1989, the
      authors observed, in three Hepato-gastroenterology units, 10 cases of acute
      colitis in patients suffering from serious psychiatric disorders, most of them
      inpatients of mental hospitals. The detailed study of 7 of these cases emphasized
      a certain number of common features: there was no previous history of digestive
      disease, the psychiatric illness was serious and longstanding, acute colitis was 
      severe, and there was no recurrence during clinical and endoscopic follow-up
      averaging 4.3 years. Of these 7 patients, 2 were not taking psychotropes at the
      time of colitis or after, 2 had discontinued their treatment for a few days, and 
      2 had not stopped taking psychotropes. One patient died. The short-term and
      long-term evolution in these cases was not influenced by the intake or not of
      psychotropes. The pathogeny of this colitis is yet to be determined: infection is
      the most likely origin.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease. Part II: Clinical and therapeutic aspects.
PG  - 669-746
AB  - Once regarded as medical curiosities, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease have
      achieved a remarkable change in status recently and today are among the more
      compelling of all human illnesses. The cause(s) of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) are not known. Genetic, environmental, microbial, and immunologic factors
      are involved, but the precise mechanisms are obscure. The incidence of ulcerative
      colitis is relatively stable, while Crohn's disease continues to increase in
      frequency. In 10% to 15% of patients, it is hard to differentiate between
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn's colitis, however, problems with diagnosis usually 
      resolve with time and repeated examinations. In part I of his two-part monograph 
      on IBD, Dr. Kirsner addressed the nature and pathogenesis of the disease.
      Increased study of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in recent years has
      generated new knowledge regarding their etiology. Part I focused on microbial,
      immunologic, and genetic mechanisms of, and the inflammatory process involved in 
      the disease. In this part, Dr. Kirsner deals with the clinical features, course, 
      and management of IBD, based on the author's 55 years of experience with these
      problems and supplemented by critical examination of the recent (1988-1990)
      literature. Particular attention is directed to the symptoms and physical
      findings of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. The laboratory, radiologic,
      endoscopic, and pathologic features, and the many systemic complications. IBDs
      are mimicked by several enterocolonic infections and other conditions making
      differential diagnosis necessary. Inflammatory bowel disease in children and the 
      elderly conforms to conventional clinical patterns modified by the health
      circumstances of the respective age groups. Because the cause of IBD has not been
      established, current medical therapy is facilitative and supportive rather than

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease. Part I: Nature and pathogenesis.
PG  - 605-66
AB  - Once regarded as medical curiosities, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease have
      achieved a remarkable change in status recently and today are among the more
      compelling of all human illnesses. The cause(s) of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) are not known. Genetic, environmental, microbial, and immunologic factors
      are involved, but the precise mechanisms are obscure. The incidence of ulcerative
      colitis is relatively stable, while Crohn's disease continues to increase in
      frequency. In 10% to 15% of patients, it is hard to differentiate between
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn's colitis; however, problems with diagnosis usually 
      resolve with time and repeated examinations. In part I of his two-part monograph 
      on IBD, Dr. Kirsner addresses the nature and pathogenesis of the disease.
      Increased study of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in recent years has
      generated new knowledge regarding their etiology. Part I focuses on microbial,
      immunologic, and genetic mechanisms and the inflammatory processes involved in
      the disease. In part II, which will be presented in next month's issue of
      Disease-a-Month, Dr. Kirsner deals with the clinical features, course, and
      management of IBD, based on the author's 55 years of experience with these
      problems and supplemented by critical examination of the recent (1988-1990)
      literature. Particular attention is directed to the symptoms and physical
      findings of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, the laboratory, radiologic,
      endoscopic, and pathologic features, and the many systemic complications. The
      IBDs are mimicked by several enterocolonic infections and other conditions,
      making differential diagnosis necessary. Inflammatory bowel disease in children
      and the elderly conforms to conventional clinical patterns modified by the health
      circumstances of the respective age groups. Because the cause of IBD has not been
      established, current medical therapy is facilitative and supportive rather than
      curative. The principles of medical treatment are approximately the same for
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Treatment emphasizes a program rather
      than a drug and also considers the individuality of the therapeutic response. A
      clearer understanding of dietary and nutritional needs, including
      hyperalimentation and electrolyte and fluid balance, aids treatment.
      Antidiarrheal and antispasmodic preparations and sedatives are prescribed for
      symptom relief. The bowel inflammation is controlled with sulfasalazine or the
      newer 5-amino salicylic acid (5-ASA) compounds, antibacterial drugs for
      complications of Crohn's disease and IBD, adrenocortical steroids, and the
      immunosuppressive compounds 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), azathioprine, and
      cyclosporine, as determined in each patient. The surgical procedures available
      for treatment of ulcerative colitis include total proctocolectomy and ileostomy
      or ileoanal anastomosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

TI  - Metabolism of vitamin A in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 391-5
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine serum retinol levels in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease and to attempt to elucidate the mechanism of changes
      in vitamin A metabolism in these disorders. It was found that in 15 patients with
      active ulcerative colitis, 14 patients with active Crohn's disease and in 3
      operated patients with recurrent Crohn's disease serum retinol levels and
      retinol-binding protein were significantly lower than in controls. Concentrations
      of vitamin A did not depend on the localization of inflammatory bowel disease,
      previous ileal resections, duration of the disease or age and sex of the
      patients. During successful treatment of active ulcerative colitis normalization 
      of serum retinol levels without substitution of vitamin A was observed. Repeated 
      determinations in patients with Crohn's disease who had low serum retinol levels 
      in an active phase of disease revealed normal vitamin A levels in an inactive
      phase. The absorption of vitamins A and E in patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease was normal. The normal serum retinol concentrations in patients with
      diarrhea due to irritable bowel syndrome, and in those with anorexia nervosa
      exclude the influence of diarrhea and body weight itself on vitamin A levels. The
      results of this study indicate that serum retinol levels in patients with active 
      inflammatory bowel disease are secondary to the decreased serum retinol-binding
      protein concentrations, and probably depend on the increased protein catabolism
      in these disorders.

TI  - [Changes in cell-mediated immune reactions in Crohn's disease].
PG  - 529-32
AB  - In a prospective study the effect on cell-mediated immunity (Merieux-Multitest), 
      nutritional state and parameters of inflammation was compared in conservatively
      (n = 21) and surgically (n = 20) treated patients with Crohn's disease. Before
      therapy both groups showed a significantly lower immune response compared with
      healthy controls. The therapeutical effect was similar in both groups concerning 
      normalization of parameters of inflammation, CDAI and state of nutrition. In
      contrast, normalization of immune response in skin test was only observed after
      bowel resection, while conservatively treated patients remained in hyperergy. In 
      conclusion, the impairment of the cell mediated immunity in Crohn's disease must 
      be secondary. Excluding patients with steroid therapy there was no correlation
      between preoperative annergy or hyperergy and postoperative complications.

TI  - Omega-3 fatty acids in health and disease and in growth and development.
PG  - 438-63
AB  - Several sources of information suggest that man evolved on a diet with a ratio of
      omega 6 to omega 3 fatty acids of approximately 1 whereas today this ratio is
      approximately 10:1 to 20-25:1, indicating that Western diets are deficient in
      omega 3 fatty acids compared with the diet on which humans evolved and their
      genetic patterns were established. Omega-3 fatty acids increase bleeding time;
      decrease platelet aggregation, blood viscosity, and fibrinogen; and increase
      erythrocyte deformability, thus decreasing the tendency to thrombus formation. In
      no clinical trial, including coronary artery graft surgery, has there been any
      evidence of increased blood loss due to ingestion of omega 3 fatty acids. Many
      studies show that the effects of omega 3 fatty acids on serum lipids depend on
      the type of patient and whether the amount of saturated fatty acids in the diet
      is held constant. In patients with hyperlipidemia, omega 3 fatty acids decrease
      low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol if the saturated fatty acid content is 
      decreased, otherwise there is a slight increase, but at high doses (32 g) they
      lower LDL cholesterol; furthermore, they consistently lower serum triglycerides
      in normal subjects and in patients with hypertriglyceridemia whereas the effect
      on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) varies from no effect to slight increases. The 
      discrepancies between animal and human studies most likely are due to differences
      between animal and human metabolism. In clinical trials eicosapentaenoic acid
      (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the form of fish oils along with
      antirheumatic drugs improve joint pain in patients with rheumatoid arthritis;
      have a beneficial effect in patients with ulcerative colitis; and in combination 
      with drugs, improve the skin lesions, lower the hyperlipidemia from etretinates, 
      and decrease the toxicity of cyclosporin in patients with psoriasis. In various
      animal models omega 3 fatty acids decrease the number and size of tumors and
      increase the time elapsed before appearance of tumors. Studies with nonhuman
      primates and human newborns indicate that DHA is essential for the normal
      functional development of the retina and brain, particularly in premature
      infants. Because omega 3 fatty acids are essential in growth and development
      throughout the life cycle, they should be included in the diets of all humans.
      Omega-3 and omega 6 fatty acids are not interconvertible in the human body and
      are important components of practically all cell membranes. Whereas cellular
      proteins are genetically determined, the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)
      composition of cell membranes is to a great extent dependent on the dietary
      intake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

TI  - Serum concentrations of tumour necrosis factor alpha in childhood chronic
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 913-7
AB  - Serum tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) concentrations were measured by
      enzyme linked immunoadsorbent assay in 31 normal children and during 65 episodes 
      of clinical remission and 54 episodes of relapse in 92 children with chronic
      inflammatory bowel disease. An appreciable rise in TNF alpha was found only in
      children in relapse of ulcerative colitis and colonic Crohn's disease. The group 
      of children with small bowel Crohn's disease in relapse did not show increases of
      TNF alpha above control concentrations, despite an equivalent rise in disease
      indices. Height velocity was depressed in children with relapse of large bowel
      Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis compared with the equivalent condition in 
      remission. The impairment of growth velocity was significantly greater in relapse
      of large bowel Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis than in small bowel Crohn's
      disease alone, although for the subgroups in stage 1 puberty (prepubertal) the
      differences were not significant. Inadequate growth in chronic inflammatory bowel
      disease is currently ascribed to inadequate nutrition and TNF alpha may
      contribute to this through its cachexia inducing effects. It may, in addition,
      diminish pituitary growth hormone release. These results suggest that production 
      of TNF alpha may be associated with growth failure in relapse of colonic
      inflammatory bowel disease.

AB  - We describe noninfectious bloody diarrhea in 13 of 16 infants referred for
      management of short bowel syndrome and parenteral nutrition during a 33-month
      period. The condition was characterized by bloody, watery stools associated with 
      carbohydrate malabsorption. Colitis occurred at a mean age of 4.2 months during
      periods of advancing enteral feedings of a hydrolyzed protein- or amino
      acid-containing formula. Sigmoidoscopy performed in nine patients revealed edema,
      patchy erythema, loss of normal vascular pattern, and mucosal friability without 
      ulcerations or pseudomembranes. Colonic biopsy specimens demonstrated edema and
      mixed hypercellularity of the lamina propria, with prominent eosinophilia. Rectal
      bleeding ceased if formula feedings were decreased or withheld. Of multiple
      medications administered, sulfasalazine seemed to improve rectal bleeding most
      effectively in our patients and allowed for more rapid reintroduction of enteral 
      feedings.

TI  - Nutritional management of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 609-23
AB  - The etiology and specific treatment of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are
      unknown, and the treatment strategy for patients with inflammatory bowel disease 
      is essentially symptomatic and supportive. The malnutrition that frequently
      accompanies inflammatory bowel disease is a manifestation of intestinal failure
      and should be vigorously corrected with total parenteral nutrition, elemental
      diets, or both. Evidence exists for the value of total parenteral nutrition and
      elemental diets as primary therapy for inflammatory bowel disease in selected
      patients. Judicious nutritional therapy remains a cornerstone in the adjunctive
      management of these patients.

OAB - In view of the significant and articulate minority view among pediatricians that 
      breast feeding is not "worth the bother" in developed countries, this review of
      the literature delves into the evidence from both developed and developing
      countries for the advantages of breastfeeding, both in infants and for long-term 
      health. Infants in developed settings experience twice the hospitalization rate
      and more severe illness from lower respiratory tract infection, primarily
      respiratory syncytial virus. In developing countries the mortality risk is
      4-fold. for otitis media, the relative risks were 3.3-4.3 for Finnish infants.
      Bacterial meningitis and/or bacteremia had a 4-fold risk for hospitalization in a
      Connecticut study, and a 3-fold relative risk in 2 developing country studies.
      Human milk was the best preventative for bacteremia and necrotizing enterocolitis
      in prematures in British neonatal units. A 20-fold reduction in neonatal deaths
      occurred in Philippine study of breastfeeding, especially in low birth weight
      babies. Diarrhea causes the most infant mortality in developing nations, where
      bottle-feeding raises rates 14-fold. In the U.S. estimated relative risks is 3.7 
      for diarrheal mortality. Sudden infant death is about 1/5 less common in U.S.
      breast fed babies than in bottle fed. There is evidence for better long-term
      health after breast feeding in disorders such as celiac disease, Crohn disease,
      ulcerative colitis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease,
      malignant lymphoma, chronic liver disease, atopic dermatitis, and food allergies.
      The design of good studies of protection conferred by breast feeding, and the
      possible modes of action of breast milk are discussed.

TI  - Metachronous occurrence of collagenous colitis and ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 447-9
AB  - Collagenous colitis and ulcerative colitis are distinct disorders. A 67 year old 
      woman with clinical and histological evidence of collagenous colitis had an
      abrupt symptomatic exacerbation while taking anti-inflammatory treatment with
      sulphasalazine and prednisone. Repeat colorectal endoscopy showed active mucosal 
      inflammation and colonic biopsy specimens were consistent with active ulcerative 
      colitis. After bowel rest, total parenteral nutrition, intensification of the
      anti-inflammatory regimen, and withdrawal of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs (which she had taken continuously for osteoarthritis) diarrhoea abated.
      Colorectal biopsy specimens obtained when the patient's symptoms had improved
      showed inactive ulcerative colitis with no evidence of collagenous colitis. This 
      may be the first case to be reported of the metachronous association of
      collagenous and ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Hepatic metabolism of cholesterol in Crohn's disease. Effect of partial resection
      of ileum.
PG  - 1046-53
AB  - To study cholesterol metabolism in Crohn's disease and especially the effect of
      ileum resection, liver biopsy specimens were obtained from patients undergoing
      partial ileal resection because of Crohn's disease (n = 17) and patients with
      Crohn's colitis undergoing colectomy (n = 3). Gallstone-free patients (n = 16)
      undergoing cholecystectomy because of adenomyomas or polyps of the gallbladder
      served as controls. The mean levels of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity
      and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity, rate-determining
      enzymes in bile acid, and cholesterol synthesis, respectively, were twofold to
      threefold higher in the ileum-resected patients than in the controls. Significant
      positive correlations were obtained between length of resected ileum and
      cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity. Provided patients who had received
      total parenteral nutrition preoperatively were excluded from analysis, a
      significant correlation was also observed between length of resected ileum and
      3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity. Significant positive
      correlations were also obtained between length of resected ileum and serum levels
      of 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol (a marker for bile acid biosynthesis) and
      lathosterol (a marker for cholesterol synthesis). The plasma levels of total and 
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were negatively correlated to the length of
      resected ileum. The expression of hepatic low-density lipoprotein-receptor
      binding activity was determined in five of the patients and in three of the
      controls. A significant positive correlation was observed between
      3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity and low-density
      lipoprotein-receptor binding activity. The results show that malabsorption of
      bile acids leads to parallel stimulation of cholesterol synthesis, cholesterol
      degradation, and low-density lipoprotein-receptor expression in human liver. The 
      resulting effect in the present patients was a significant reduction in
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

TI  - Effects of olsalazine and sulphasalazine on jejunal and ileal water and
      electrolyte absorption in normal human subjects.
PG  - 270-4
AB  - The effect of sulphasalazine and olsalazine on jejunal and ileal water and
      electrolyte absorption was investigated in normal subjects by a steady state
      intestinal perfusion of a physiological glucose bicarbonate electrolyte solution 
      in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations of each drug.
      (Olsalazine 0.25 g/l, 1.0 g/l, jejunum; 0.5 g/l, 1.0 g/l, ileum; sulphasalazine
      0.25 g/l, 0.5 g/l, 2.0 g/l jejunum; 1.0 g/l, 2.0 g/l, ileum.) In the jejunum
      olsalazine at 1.0 g/l significantly inhibited water, sodium, chloride, and
      potassium absorption (p less than 0.05). In the ileum olsalazine at 0.5 and 1 g/l
      significantly inhibited glucose uptake (p less than 0.04) and water absorption (p
      less than 0.03). In the jejunum sulphasalazine had a dose related and significant
      inhibitory effect on water, bicarbonate, and sodium absorption and at 2.0 g/l an 
      inhibitory effect on chloride, potassium (p less than 0.005), and glucose (p less
      than 0.05) absorption. In the ileum sulphasalazine had no significant effect on
      water and electrolyte absorption. All inhibitory effects were rapidly reversible.
      These data show that unexplained diarrhoea in patients with ulcerative colitis
      treated with olsalazine may occur as a consequence of inhibition of water and
      electrolyte absorption in the small intestine and that the mechanisms of
      inhibition of sulphasalazine and olsalazine are different.

TI  - [Qualitative study of fecal alpha-1-antitrypsin in patients with inflammatory
      digestive disease and patients with ileostomy].
PG  - 301-5
AB  - Alpha-1-antitrypsin is a glycoprotein which is excreted in feces under three
      different forms of molecular weight 38, 45 and 51 kDa. The 45 and 38 kDa forms
      are the result of a partial or total removal of the carbohydrate moiety,
      respectively. We determined the molecular forms of fecal alpha-1-antitrypsin in
      10 controls, 13 patients with protein-losing enteropathy other than inflammatory 
      bowel disease, 70 patients with active (n = 55) (CDAI greater than 150) and
      inactive (n = 15) (CDAI less than 150) Crohn's disease, 14 patients with active
      (n = 12) and inactive (n = 2) ulcerative colitis, and 17 patients with ileostomy.
      Fecal 38 kDa alpha-1-antitrypsin was found in all controls, all patients with
      protein-losing enteropathy, in 82 percent of patients with inactive inflammatory 
      bowel disease, and in 20 percent of patients with active inflammatory bowel
      disease. In contrast, the 51 kDa and 45 kDa forms were present in feces of 80
      percent of patients with active inflammatory bowel disease, and in only 17
      percent of patients with inactive inflammatory bowel disease. Patients with
      Crohn's disease and the 51 kDa form (n = 39) had significantly higher values of
      activity index (CDAI) and orosomucoid than patients with Crohn's disease and the 
      38 kDa form (n = 26) (P less than 0.01). Deglycosylated 38 kDa
      alpha-1-antitrypsin was never recovered in ileostomy samples. This suggests that 
      deglycosylation of alpha-1-antitrypsin occurred in the colon and is impaired in
      patients with active inflammatory bowel disease.

      what scientific grounds do we treat these patients? A survey shows that the
      considerable decline in mortality which has occurred as regards ulcerous colitis 
      ensued rather via trial and error than as a result of regular clinical tests.

TI  - Effect of fat and retinol loading on serum triglyceride and retinol levels in
      patients with ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 21-6
AB  - Serum copper, zinc, selenium, magnesium, calcium, cholesterol, triglyceride and
      retinol contents were determined in 11 patients with ulcerative colitis and in 20
      healthy volunteers. Lipid and retinol loadings were performed as well. No
      differences were found in serum copper, zinc, calcium and selenium levels between
      the groups. Serum magnesium levels were somewhat lower in the patients than in
      the volunteers. During the period of loading, cholesterol levels did not differ
      between the two groups at any time. Triglyceride levels except for two persons,
      were higher in patients. Triglyceride curves showed pathological courses in each 
      case. Retinol concentrations in patients remained below the values observed in
      volunteers. Data suggest a disturbed utilization of fat and retinol in patients
      with ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Cytomegalovirus colitis and wasting.
PG  - S36-41
AB  - Disseminated cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is associated with significant and
      progressive depletion of body cell mass and body fat in patients with the
      acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). In a study examining the effect of
      ganciclovir on wasting in AIDS patients with disseminated CMV infection, it was
      found that patients receiving ganciclovir had significant improvement in such
      variables as body cell mass, body fat, body weight, and total body energy content
      when compared with those not receiving ganciclovir. The repletion of body cell
      mass observed in AIDS patients with disseminated CMV infection who are
      successfully treated with ganciclovir appears to be associated with improved
      quality of life and prolongation of survival.
