TI  - Role of microecology in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - S34-8
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic conditions of unknown etiology.
      Current therapy mitigates the severity of acute bouts of mucosal inflammation but
      an eradication therapy is lacking. Growing incidence of IBD is associated with
      social development. Epidemiology suggests a relationship between the
      establishment of the individual gut flora and the risk of developing IBD.
      Patients show an impaired tolerance towards commensal bacteria of the resident
      flora. Unrestrained activation of the intestinal immune system against some
      commensal bacteria appears to be responsible for the characteristic relapsing
      course of these diseases. Wide-spectrum antibiotic therapy reduces bacterial load
      and mitigates intestinal inflammation in human IBD and in animal models. Current 
      research aims at the identification of probiotics for bacterial antagonism
      therapies. Probiotics are living microorganisms which upon ingestion in certain
      numbers exert health benefits beyond inherent basic nutrition. Colonization with 
      a Lactobacillus reuteri strain can prevent the development of colitis in
      genetically susceptible mice. Other studies have used a bacterium genetically
      engineered to secrete the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 and demonstrated a
      therapeutic effect in animal models of colitis. Moreover, some probiotics may
      naturally exhibit antiinflammatory properties when interacting with the human gut
      mucosa. Prebiotics such as inulin have also been shown to prevent colonic
      inflammation in animal models. Preliminary clinical trials with probiotics in IBD
      are encouraging. Probiotics offer a valuable tool for the prevention and control 
      of inflammatory bowel diseases.

TI  - [Diet therapy in chronic inflammatory bowel disease: results from meta-analysis
      and randomized controlled trials].
PG  - 2041-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic inflammatory bowel
      diseases of unknown etiology. Unspecific immunosuppressive therapy represents
      current standard treatment and is often associated with severe side effects.
      Several treatment regimens have been evaluated to identify alternative
      therapeutic options. Among these different diet therapies were investigated.
      Objective of this paper is to review the results of diet therapy in chronic
      inflammatory bowel disease on the basis of randomised controlled trials and
      meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. METHODS: Medline and Cochrane
      Library were searched for meta-analysis and randomised controlled trials
      investigating this question. Additionally reference lists of identified articles 
      and text books were checked for further trials. RESULTS: Four meta-analyses
      investigated the treatment of acute Crohn's disease with elemental-,
      semi-elemental-, and polymeric diets in comparison to corticosteroids or to
      another form of enteral diet. All meta-analyses show a superiority of
      corticosteroids and no difference in the effect of the compared enteral diets.
      Randomised controlled trials investigating diet therapy in ulcerative colitis
      have not been summarised in a meta-analysis yet. Eleven randomised trials were
      identified which evaluated diets in ulcerative colitis patients: Dietary
      supplementation with n-3-fatty acids (6 trials), elemental diet [2], dietary
      supplementation with dietary fiber [1], elimination diet [1], and dietary
      supplementation with olestra [1]. Only for the elimination diet a significant
      positive effect on the course of disease was found in one trial which
      investigated only 18 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Enteral nutritional therapy of acute 
      Crohn's disease is less effective than treatment with corticosteroids. In case of
      severe steroid induced side effects diet treatment can present a promising
      alternative. Superiority of one of the investigated different formulations was
      not found. Meta-analyses of randomised trials provide a clear and easy to
      understand presentation of the effect of this intervention. Eleven published
      trials investigating the effect of diets in ulcerative colitis show only for
      elimination diet a positive treatment effect. The trials do find a positive
      effect of one of the other interventions but the trials are very small and cannot
      exclude a treatment effect. Meta-analysis of these trials would be helpful for a 
      better presentation and understanding of these results.

AB  - Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is used to evaluate upper gastrointestinal
      symptoms in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. This article discusses the 
      procedure, which may allow for the diagnosis of Crohn's disease of the esophagus,
      stomach, and/or duodenum. Biopsies of normal gastric mucosa in patients with
      indeterminate colitis may be helpful in making a diagnosis of Crohn's colitis.
      Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy may allow for therapeutic intervention in terms 
      of bleeding and stricturing disease.

TI  - Omega-3 fatty acids in inflammation and autoimmune diseases.
PG  - 495-505
AB  - Among the fatty acids, it is the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) which
      possess the most potent immunomodulatory activities, and among the omega-3 PUFA, 
      those from fish oil-eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid
      (DHA)--are more biologically potent than alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). Some of the 
      effects of omega-3 PUFA are brought about by modulation of the amount and types
      of eicosanoids made, and other effects are elicited by eicosanoid-independent
      mechanisms, including actions upon intracellular signaling pathways,
      transcription factor activity and gene expression. Animal experiments and
      clinical intervention studies indicate that omega-3 fatty acids have
      anti-inflammatory properties and, therefore, might be useful in the management of
      inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Coronary heart disease, major depression,
      aging and cancer are characterized by an increased level of interleukin 1 (IL-1),
      a proinflammatory cytokine. Similarly, arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative
      colitis and lupus erythematosis are autoimmune diseases characterized by a high
      level of IL-1 and the proinflammatory leukotriene LTB(4) produced by omega-6
      fatty acids. There have been a number of clinical trials assessing the benefits
      of dietary supplementation with fish oils in several inflammatory and autoimmune 
      diseases in humans, including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative
      colitis, psoriasis, lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis and migraine
      headaches. Many of the placebo-controlled trials of fish oil in chronic
      inflammatory diseases reveal significant benefit, including decreased disease
      activity and a lowered use of anti-inflammatory drugs.

TI  - Role of serology and routine laboratory tests in childhood inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 325-9
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Serology is reported to be helpful in evaluating children for
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and distinguishing chronic ulcerative colitis
      (CUC) from Crohn's disease (CD). The markers include perinuclear staining
      antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA) for CUC and anti-Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae antibody (ASCA) for CD. In the clinical setting, hemoglobin (Hgb) and 
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are commonly performed for screening
      symptomatic children for IBD. We examined whether there was an additional benefit
      of serology in addition to specific symptoms and routine laboratory tests in
      screening for IBD. METHOD: Medical record data was reviewed on children
      investigated for IBD from February 1999 to April 2001. Children were included if 
      they had blood analyzed for pANCA and ASCA, Hgb, ESR, and colonoscopy as part of 
      their assessment. RESULTS: Of 177 cases reviewed, 51 were diagnosed with CUC, 39 
      with CD, and 26 other inflammatory conditions. Visible rectal bleeding was the
      most discriminating symptom (occurred in 60/90 cases of IBD and 5/61 without
      IBD). There was a significant difference between the proportion with CUC positive
      for pANCA (42/51) and those with abnormal Hgb and ESR (30/51) (p < 0.05), but not
      between children with CD who were ASCA positive (18/39) and those with abnormal
      Hgb and ESR (26/39) (p = 0.27). The sensitivity and specificity of combined pANCA
      and ASCA was 68% and 92%, respectively. For the combination of Hgb, ESR, and the 
      presence of rectal bleeding the respective values were 86% and 67%. Serology
      combined with Hgb and ESR and rectal bleeding as independent factors
      significantly (p < 0.05) improved sensitivity (89%) but reduced specificity
      (60%). Screening with the combination of rectal bleeding, Hgb, and ESR identified
      86% (77/90) patients with IBD prior to an endoscopic procedure. A further 3 of 90
      (3.3%) screened positive with the addition of serology. CONCLUSION: Serology
      tests have a high degree of specificity for IBD while routine laboratory test
      have a higher sensitivity. When serology is combined with rectal bleeding, Hgb,
      and ESR, the sensitivity of screening children for IBD is significantly improved.
      However the large majority of children with IBD can be identified with a clinical
      history and routine laboratory tests as needing an endoscopic procedure with
      little benefit of adding serology.

TI  - Prevalence of factor V G1691A (Leiden), prothrombin G20210A, and methylene
      tetrahydrofolate reductase C677T thrombophilic mutations in children with
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 629-35
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have an increased
      incidence of thromboembolic events. This risk may be caused by an increased
      frequency of thrombophilic mutations such as factor V Leiden G1691A (FVL),
      prothrombin G20210A (PT), or methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase C667T (MTHFR). 
      Prevalence rates of heterozygous mutations in FVL, PT, and MTHFR are reported for
      whites (1.8%, 1.3%, 26.6%, respectively), blacks (0.8%, 0.3%, and 12.4%,
      respectively), and Hispanics (1.2%, 2.4%, and 41.5%, respectively). We sought to 
      determine the prevalence of these thrombophilic mutations in a large cohort of
      children with IBD. METHODS: Children aged 21 years or younger with IBD were
      genotyped for FVL, PT, and MTHFR mutations by polymerase chain reaction
      amplification and restriction enzyme digestion. Prevalence rates were compared
      with established rates in the respective populations. RESULTS: Of 92 patients
      enrolled, 89 (62 with Crohn disease, 24 with ulcerative colitis, and 3 with
      indeterminate colitis) had genotype results available. The mean age was 13.3 +/- 
      4.2 years (range, 2-21 years). Statistical analysis was performed on 89 FVL, PT, 
      and MTHFR allele pairs. Polymerase chain reaction genotyping identified 5
      patients with heterozygous FVL mutations, 3 patients heterozygous for the PT
      mutation, and 36 patients heterozygous and 4 patients homozygous for the MTHFR
      mutation. The thrombophilic allele mutation frequencies in our sample were not
      significantly different from predicted weighted average values: FVL, 2.8% versus 
      1.5%; PT, 1.7% versus 1.1%; and MTHFR, 24.7% versus 24.4%. In 24 patients with a 
      family history of thrombosis, 1 was heterozygous for FVL and for MTHFR, 1 was
      heterozygous for FVL and homozygous for MTHFR, 2 were heterozygous for PT, and 9 
      were heterozygous MTHFR. There was no significant correlation between family
      history of thrombosis and presence of a thrombophilic mutation. The four patients
      with homozygous mutations for MTHFR, two of whom also were heterozygous for FVL, 
      did not have either a personal history of thrombosis or a family history of
      thrombotic events. Two patients had thrombotic events without mutations in these 
      genotypes: one had protein S deficiency and the other had no identifiable cause. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The presence of genetic mutations that predispose to hypercoagulable
      states does not appear to correlate with the prevalence of IBD or to
      thromboembolic events in patients with IBD. There was no statistical difference
      between the proportions of the mutated allele frequency in our study patients and
      the general population.

TI  - Idiopathic chronic ulcerative enteritis--the role of radical surgical resection.
PG  - 406-8
AB  - Idiopathic chronic ulcerative enteritis is uncommon. It is a term that describes 
      ulceration of the small bowel in the absence of a recognisable cause. Patients
      mainly present with a surgical abdomen and their management often proves to be a 
      therapeutic challenge. Our series describes three such cases: the first patient
      presented with a tender left iliac fossa mass and rectal bleeding, the second
      with peritonitis and pneumoperitoneum, the third with severe acute colitis. All
      three patients needed urgent surgical intervention with further laparotomies due 
      to recurrent ulceration, perforation and fistula formation in addition to
      intensive supportive measures such as inotropes and total parenteral nutrition.
      The importance and challenges of idiopathic chronic ulcerative enteritis are
      therefore discussed.

TI  - Ulcerative colitis in children: medical management.
PG  - 807-15
AB  - Ulcerative colitis is a chronic relapsing inflammatory disorder of the colonic
      mucosa of unknown etiology. The inflammatory process involves the mucosa and
      submucosa in a continuous segment of bowel with rectal involvement in almost all 
      cases. Since its etiology is unknown, therapy is directed at modulating the
      inflammatory response in order to control symptoms and to prevent relapses.
      5-aminosalicylates and corticosteroids have been the most widely used therapeutic
      agents for treatment of ulcerative colitis. Recently, experience has been gained 
      with the use of other immunomodulators, such as mercaptopurine, azathioprine,
      methotrexate, cyclosporine, and tacrolimus, in pediatric patients. Colectomy is
      indicated in patients with severe colitis who do not respond to intensive medical
      therapy. The care of children with ulcerative colitis not only involves control
      of symptoms from gastrointestinal and extraintestinal manifestations, but also
      optimizing growth and development. The complications of chronic inflammation and 
      long-term medical therapy must be weighed against the risks and benefits of
      surgery for children and adolescents with this condition.

TI  - Effects of appendicectomy on the course of ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 803-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Appendicectomy reduces the risk of having ulcerative colitis.
      However, its effect on the natural history of ulcerative colitis remains
      uncertain. AIM: To determine whether appendicectomy reduces the overall severity 
      of ulcerative colitis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Appendicectomy status and smoking
      habits were specified by direct interview in 638 patients seen consecutively
      between 1997 and 2000. Severity of ulcerative colitis was assessed by reviewing
      therapeutic needs from the onset of colitis. Additionally, the annual incidence
      of flare up was assessed prospectively between 1997 and 2000 in patients who had 
      not been colectomised. RESULTS: The 10 year risk of colectomy was 16 (7)% in
      previously appendicectomised patients (n=49) compared with 33 (2)% in
      non-appendicectomised patients (n=589, p=0.05). Cox regression showed that
      previous appendicectomy and current smoking were independent factors protecting
      against colectomy (adjusted hazard ratio and 95% confidence intervals: 0.40
      (0.20-0.78) and 0.60 (0.40-0.95), respectively). The respective proportions of
      appendicectomised and non-appendicectomised patients who required oral steroids
      and immunosuppressive therapy were not significantly different (67% v 70% and 27%
      v 19%, respectively). Between 1997 and 2000, ulcerative colitis was active for
      48% of the time in appendicectomised patients (47 of 98 patient years) and for
      62% of the time in non-appendicectomised patients (631 of 1024 patient years;
      p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Previous appendicectomy is associated with a less severe
      course of ulcerative colitis. The beneficial effect of appendicectomy on the risk
      of colectomy is additive to that of current smoking.

TI  - [Chronic intestinal inflammatory diseases].
PG  - 259-65
AB  - In the last years the research on the etiopathogenesis of the inflammatory bowel 
      disease (IBD) is focused around immunological aspects. Many authors consider that
      the intestinal inflammation is due to an inappropriate immunological response to 
      normally present antigens in the gut. Two aspects must to be considered between
      IBD: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. IBD's diagnosis is based on the
      symptomatology, (cramps, liquid feces with mucus and blood, anorexia and weight
      loss), hemato-clinical tests (ESR, PCR, blood platelet, mucoprotein, sideremia)
      and radiological tests (tenuis Rx, abdominal echography, fibro endoscophy and
      scintigraphy). Principal aim of the therapy is the clinical remission. Following 
      the remission starts a maintenance protocol. Parenteral nutrition is used in
      paediatric and adolescent age. Diets have been used to provide a convenient
      nutritious contribution with growth improvement and partial remission of activity
      index of the disease. Pharmacology therapy represents a valid instrument to
      obtain the remission. Colectomy is performed on unsuccessful medical therapy.
      Early studies on IBD's pathogenesis bring to the use of biological therapies that
      show beneficial effects on the disease.

TI  - Lamina propria and circulating interleukin-6 in newly diagnosed pediatric
      inflammatory bowel disease patients.
PG  - 2603-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Understanding cytokine production patterns in early mucosal lesions
      of pediatric patients newly diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may
      be critical to understanding IBD pathogenesis. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) has a central
      role in a multitude of immune system reactions; however, inconsistent lamina
      propria and serum IL-6 has been reported in IBD patients. Newly diagnosed
      pediatric IBD patients have not previously been evaluated for lamina propria or
      serum IL-6. METHODS: Serum and intestinal lamina propria biopsy whole organ
      culture supernatants were evaluated by ELISA for IL-6 obtained from newly
      diagnosed IBD patients, before initiation of immunomodulatory therapies. RESULTS:
      Levels of lamina propria IL-6 demonstrated significant correlation with graded
      severity of histological inflammation (p < 0.001). Log-transformed serum and
      organ culture IL-6 levels demonstrated significant correlation (p < 0.0001, R2 = 
      0.6226). Assigning a demarcation level of >400 pg/ml, serum IL-6 concentrations
      were a superior marker for the presence of microscopic intestinal inflammation
      than erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), with a sensitivity of 82%, specificity
      of 100%, positive predictive value of 100%, and negative predictive value of 82%.
      When evaluating subtypes of IBD, serum IL-6 levels were correlated more
      significantly with active disease in ulcerative colitis patients (p = 0.01, R2 = 
      0.74) than in Crohn's disease patients (p = 0.21, R2 = 0.33). CONCLUSIONS: This
      study outlines graded production of IL-6 in intestinal lamina propria and serum
      of newly diagnosed pediatric IBD patients, confirming the presence of IL-6 in
      early IBD patients. In addition, serum IL-6 may be a good predictor of IBD in
      pediatric patients with suspected or newly diagnosed IBD.

TI  - Mucosal and invading bacteria in patients with inflammatory bowel disease
      compared with controls.
PG  - 1034-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: Endogenous intestinal bacteria and/or specific bacterial pathogens
      are suspected of being involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel
      diseases (IBD). The aim of this study was to investigate IBD tissues for
      different bacterial population groups harbouring the mucosal surface and/or
      invading the mucosa. METHODS: Tissue sections from surgical resections from the
      terminal ileum and/or the colon from 24 IBD patients (12 active ulcerative
      colitis (UC), 12 active Crohn disease (CD)) and 14 non-IBD controls were studied 
      by fluorescent in situ hybridization on a quantifiable basis. RESULTS: More
      bacteria were detected on the mucosal surface of IBD patients than on those of
      non-IBD controls (P < 0.05). Bacterial invasion of the mucosa was evident in
      83.3% of colonic specimens from the UC patients, in 55.6% of the ileal and in 25%
      of the colonic specimens from the CD patients, but no bacteria were detected in
      the tissues of the controls. Colonic UC specimens were colonized by a variety of 
      organisms, such as bacteria belonging to the gamma subdivision of Proteobacteria,
      the Enterobacteriaceae, the Bacteroides/Prevotella cluster, the Clostridium
      histolyticum/Clostridium lituseburense group, the Clostridium
      coccoides/Eubacterium rectale group, high G + C Gram-positive bacteria, or
      sulphate-reducing bacteria, while CD samples harboured mainly bacteria belonging 
      to the former three groups. CONCLUSION: Pathogenic events in CD and UC may be
      associated with different alterations in the mucosal flora of the ileum and
      colon.

TI  - Growth in paediatric Crohn's disease.
PG  - 11-5
AB  - Growth failure (GF) is one of the major complications affecting children with
      inflammatory bowel disease. The faltering is temporary in 40-50% of cases and
      prolonged in 10-20% in Crohn's disease (CD). Such failure is rare in children
      with ulcerative colitis (5%). This complication is often associated with retarded
      bone development and delayed onset of sexual maturation. The delayed linear
      growth has a variety of causes including insufficient intake due to anorexia and 
      the inflammatory process with increased energy and protein expenditure. Other
      factors are increased intestinal loss, secondary hypopituitarism and treatment
      with steroids. Therapeutic strategies of CD in children have changed this last
      decade by introducing new therapeutic agents such as topic steroids,
      immunosuppressors, anti-TNF (antibody and notably in children enteral nutrition
      which has shown its efficacy in inducing remissions of active CD, restoring
      nutritional status and stimulation of linear growth. The results of a recent
      prospective multicentric study over 2 years in 82 CD show that severe GF (-2 SD) 
      is initially present in 15% (n = 12), among them 11 remain < -2SD after 2 years
      of follow-up. Six patients who were on the normal range initially increased their
      GF during the follow-up (< -2SD) (total 21% < -2SD (n = 17) at 2 years). At
      inclusion in this group there was no difference in growth velocity, used of
      steroids, enteral nutrition or severity of CD as compared to the group with no
      GF. It suggests that new treatment strategy should be developed in the future for
      this specific complication of paediatric CD.

TI  - Fundamental mechanisms of growth failure in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 7-10
AB  - Growth failure is common in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and
      has been attributed chiefly to undernutrition. Liquid enteral feeding can reverse
      the calorie deficit and increase growth velocity. The inflammatory process per se
      may also directly inhibit linear growth. After institution of enteral nutrition, 
      significant changes in serum growth factors and inflammatory indices have been
      observed before any changes in nutritional parameters [Bannerjee et al.,
      Gastroenterology 2000;118:A526]. In rats with trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid
      (TNBS)-induced colitis, about 60% of the final growth impairment can be
      attributed to undernutrition, inflammation accounting for the remaining growth
      deficit. Young patients with Crohn's disease and growth failure have normal
      stimulated and spontaneous growth hormone (GH) secretion and reduced plasma
      concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I), suggesting a degree of GH
      resistance. Rats with TNBS colitis also have normal plasma GH and reduced IGF-I
      concentrations, mediated by a combination of undernutrition and active
      inflammation. Immunoneutralization of interleukin-6 (IL-6) increases hepatic
      IGF-I mRNA expression, plasma concentrations of IGF-I and linear growth. In
      contrast, administration of anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha antibodies (TNF-ab)
      had no effect on IGF-I in this model. TNFab did, however, increase linear growth,
      suggesting inhibitory effects of TNF-alpha on the growth axis by mechanisms other
      than reduction in IGF-I. Preliminary data suggests that TNF-alpha inhibits
      maturation of growth plate chondrocytes. We have identified IL-6 receptors on
      growth plate chondrocytes but to date have not identified the effect, if any, of 
      IL-6 directly at the growth plate.

TI  - Evidence for an inflammatory bowel disease locus on chromosome 3p26: linkage,
      transmission/disequilibrium and partitioning of linkage.
PG  - 2599-606
AB  - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the two major forms of idiopathic
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are heritable, complex traits that appear to
      share some but not all susceptibility loci. We report that
      transmission/disequilibrium test analysis of a Crohn's disease genome scan
      dataset has detected an inflammatory bowel disease locus on chromosome 3p26
      (nominal P=0.000052 and genome-wide corrected P=0.039 at D3S1297). An allele
      sharing method shows significant linkage (multipoint lod=3.69) in a larger,
      independent sample of inflammatory bowel disease-affected sibling pairs. A survey
      of 16 chromosome 3p26 short tandem repeat polymorphisms in a combined sample of
      234 independent nuclear families with 324 IBD-affected sibling pairs shows
      significant linkage to chromosome 3p26 (multipoint lod=3.78) and significant
      transmission/disequilibrium test results at two adjacent markers (nominal P
      values in two different transmission/disequilibrium analysis methods=0.00011 and 
      0.0011 for the first marker, and 0.00071 and 0.00013 for the second marker).
      There is highly significant under-transmission of a common allele and modest
      over-transmission of other alleles at both markers. Families with no transmission
      to affected individuals of the under-transmitted alleles show significant linkage
      (multipoint lod=4.50) that is significantly greater in four simulation studies
      (P=0.0001, 0.0000625, 0.0000625 and 0.0000625, respectively) than the linkage
      evidence in families with transmission of the under-transmitted alleles
      (multipoint lod=0.12). Thus, the existence of an inflammatory bowel disease locus
      on chromosome 3p26 is supported by significant linkage,
      transmission/disequilibrium and partitioning of linkage evidence.

TI  - Colon mucosal pathology in infants under three months of age with diarrhea
      disorders.
PG  - 387-90
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diarrhea is a common disease in infants. It may result in
      catastrophic events, especially in early infancy. Sometimes it is difficult to
      point out the diagnosis after initial examination. Sigmoidoscopy with mucosal
      biopsy may help in assessing the nature of the disease. The goals of this study
      are to evaluate the colon mucosal pathology in young infants with unknown
      diarrhea disorders and the clinical courses of different etiologies. METHODS: We 
      performed a retrospective analysis of 64 young infants (Mean +/- SD: 1.68 +/-
      1.01 months) in whom a diagnosis of unknown diarrhea disorder had been made after
      an initial investigation. All infants received fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy and
      mucosal biopsy with consent obtained. RESULTS: The appearance of the colon mucosa
      under endoscopy were: 36 (56.2%) showing edema, 30 (46.8%) showing nodularity, 23
      (35.9%) patients with focal erythema and friable mucosa, 11 (17.1%) showed
      erosion, 7 (10.9%) patients showing hemorrhage, and negative finding in one
      patient (1.6%). Colon mucosa pathologic findings were established: 40 (62.5%) had
      eosinophilic colitis (EC) and 19 (29.7%) had nonspecific colitis. The biopsies
      were normal in 5 cases; 81.5%(22/27) of patients with EC showed eosinophils in
      the stool smear which was significantly higher ( = 0.04) compared to the group II
      (9/17); 34 of 40 EC patients responded rapidly to changes in formula. CONCLUSION:
      Sigmoidoscopy and mucosal biopsy may be useful in the pathologic diagnosis of
      unknown diarrhea disorders. Eosinophilic colitis accounts for over half of very
      young infants with diarrhea disorders suggesting for allergic etiology. Patients 
      with allergic colitis may exhibit a dramatic response to elimination of the
      offending proteins from the diet.

TI  - Lactase deficiency: not more common in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease than in patients with chronic abdominal pain.
PG  - 339-43
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Lactase deficiency is commonly found in adults with inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). Our aim was to determine its prevalence in children with IBD.
      METHODS: We conducted a retrospective and descriptive analysis of patients with
      symptomatic IBD whose mucosal lactase activity was measured on duodenal biopsies 
      obtained during gastrointestinal endoscopic evaluations. Age- and gender-matched 
      controls were chosen randomly from a group with chronic abdominal pain. RESULTS: 
      One hundred twelve patients with IBD were identified from January 1994 to
      December 2000. Seventy-nine (71%) had Crohn disease, and 33 (29%) had ulcerative 
      colitis. Forty-five (40%) of all IBD patients (29 with Crohn disease and 16 with 
      ulcerative colitis) had low lactase activity levels (< 15 microM/min/gm). The
      prevalence of lactase deficiency in patients with IBD was 37% (38 of 103) in
      white patients and 78% (7 of 9) in blacks. Thirty-four of 112 controls (30%) had 
      lactase deficiency. IBD patients were more likely to be lactase deficient than
      the controls, but the difference was not statistically significant ( = 0.162).
      Normal duodenal histology was found in 67% of lactase-deficient IBD patients
      compared with 82% in lactase-sufficient IBD patients. The frequency of duodenal
      inflammation did not differ significantly between lactase-deficient and
      -sufficient patients with IBD ( = 0.068). CONCLUSIONS: More than one third of
      pediatric patients with IBD have lactase deficiency, which is not significantly
      different from non-IBD patients with chronic abdominal pain. The majority of
      lactase-deficient patients with IBD have normal duodenal biopsy results. Lactase 
      activity from small bowel biopsy specimens can be measured at the time of initial
      endoscopy. Reevaluation, either by small bowel biopsy or the breath hydrogen
      test, may then be considered during follow-up of symptomatic patients.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel diseases: principles of nutritional therapy.
PG  - 187-98
AB  - Inflammatory Bowel Diseases - ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease- are chronic
      gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases of unknown etiology. Decreased oral
      intake, malabsorption, accelerated nutrient losses, increased requirements, and
      drug-nutrient interactions cause nutritional and functional deficiencies that
      require proper correction by nutritional therapy. The goals of the different
      forms of nutritional therapy are to correct nutritional disturbances and to
      modulate inflammatory response, thus influencing disease activity. Total
      parenteral nutrition has been used to correct and to prevent nutritional
      disturbances and to promote bowel rest during active disease, mainly in cases of 
      digestive fistulae with high output. Its use should be reserved for patients who 
      cannot tolerate enteral nutrition. Enteral nutrition is effective in inducing
      clinical remission in adults and promoting growth in children. Due to its low
      complication rate and lower costs, enteral nutrition should be preferred over
      total parenteral nutrition whenever possible. Both present equal effectiveness in
      primary therapy for remission of active Crohn's disease. Nutritional intervention
      may improve outcome in certain individuals; however, because of the costs and
      complications of such therapy, careful selection is warranted, especially in
      patients presumed to need total parenteral nutrition. Recent research has focused
      on the use of nutrients as primary treatment agents. Immunonutrition is an
      important therapeutic alternative in the management of inflammatory bowel
      diseases, modulating the inflammation and changing the eicosanoid synthesis
      profile. However, beneficial reported effects have yet to be translated into the 
      clinical practice. The real efficacy of these and other nutrients (glutamine,
      short-chain fatty acids, antioxidants) still need further evaluation through
      prospective and randomized trials.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease in children 5 years of age and younger.
PG  - 2005-10
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Clinicians are becoming increasingly aware that inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) can affect all age groups, although it has not been well described 
      in infants and young children. Our aim was to evaluate early onset IBD in
      patients 5 yr of age and younger. METHODS: Medical records of patients diagnosed 
      with early onset IBD at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia between 1977 and 
      2000 were reviewed. Patients were divided into three categories: those with
      Crohn's disease (CD), those with ulcerative colitis (UC), and those with
      indeterminant colitis (IC). RESULTS: A total of 82 patients fulfilled the
      criteria. In 12 patients (15%), the IBD diagnosis was changed during the course
      of illness. At the end of the follow-up period, linear growth failure was present
      in 10 of 35 (29%) children with CD, one of 30 (3%) with UC, and three of 17 (18%)
      with IC. Failure to thrive was a frequent presenting symptom in children with CD 
      (44%) and IC (39%), whereas in all four patients with UC and failure to thrive
      the diagnosis was subsequently changed to CD or IC. A high proportion of patients
      with CD had large bowel (89%), and perianal (34%) disease. None of the tested
      patients were positive for anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA), and 10 
      tested positive for perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (three of
      five patients with CD, five of seven with UC, and two of three with IC).
      CONCLUSIONS: Failure to thrive, at the time of presentation, is indicative of a
      final diagnosis of CD or IC, not UC. Linear growth failure is a common finding in
      patients with early onset CD. A high proportion of patients with CD have failure 
      to thrive, colonic, and perianal disease. The IBD serology panel is of limited
      clinical relevance in providing definitive diagnostic information in this
      pediatric population.

TI  - Successful nonoperative management of typhlitis in pediatric oncology patients.
PG  - 1151-5
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The optimal management for typhlitis in pediatric oncology
      patients has not always been clear from the medical literature. Trends have
      varied between operative and nonoperative approaches. The aim of this study was
      to review the successful nonoperative management of these patients at our
      institution over the last decade to further clarify management guidelines for
      this difficult problem. METHODS: Medical records of pediatric hematology and
      oncology patients up to 21 years of age with typhlitis diagnosed at the DeVos
      Children's Hospital from 1990 to 2000 were reviewed. RESULTS: Twelve patients
      were included. Ten patients (83%) with computed tomography (CT) scans suggestive 
      of the diagnosis were treated successfully nonoperatively. Management usually
      included bowel rest, antibiotics, and supplemental parenteral nutrition. Two
      patients (17%) in whom CT scans were not obtained underwent surgery for presumed 
      appendicitis and pneumoperitoneum, respectively. Typhlitis was found
      incidentally. In the latter patient, the pneumoperitoneum resulted from a
      perforated jejunum caused by graft-versus-host disease. This patient died of
      septic complications and was the only mortality in the series (8%). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Pediatric cancer patients with typhlitis can be treated carefully nonoperatively 
      with bowel rest, antibiotics, and supplemental nutrition. Usual indications for
      surgery (ie, perforation, clinical deterioration) still should be used. The early
      use of CT scanning helps to facilitate the diagnosis and may provide the ability 
      to differentiate typhlitis from other abdominal diseases for which surgery would 
      be indicated.

TI  - Platelet-activating factor regulates chloride transport in colonic epithelial
      cell monolayers.
PG  - 155-62
AB  - Platelet-activating factor (PAF) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of
      gastrointestinal diseases such as necrotizing enterocolitis, Crohn's disease, and
      ulcerative colitis. However, neither the physiologic role of PAF in the
      intestine, nor the mechanisms by which PAF participates in the pathogenesis of
      disease are well understood. The aim of the present study was to determine the
      direct effect of PAF on intestinal epithelial cell ion transport, and to
      delineate the mechanisms of regulation. Ion transport was evaluated by measuring 
      short circuit current (I(sc)) in HT29-CL19A cell monolayers using Ussing
      chambers. PAF receptor polarity was assessed using domain-selective biotinylation
      followed by immunoprecipitation and streptavidin blotting of intact epithelial
      monolayers. PAF (1-200 microM) stimulated I(sc) that followed the direction of a 
      Cl(-) gradient and was specifically inhibited by the Cl(-) channel blockers
      glybenclamide, 2,2' iminodibenzoic acid and 4,4' diisothiocyanostilbene-2, 2'
      disulfonic acid, but was unaffected by the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis 
      with indomethacin. Stimulated I(sc) was only detected after apical addition of
      PAF, correlating with the results of biotinylation experiments indicating an
      exclusive apical polarity of the PAF receptor. PAF receptor antagonists CV6209
      and octylonium bromide abolished PAF-stimulated I(sc). Thus, mucosal acting PAF
      directly and specifically stimulates ion transport via activation of an apical
      Cl(-) channel in intestinal epithelial cell monolayers independent of
      prostaglandin biosynthesis.

TI  - Anti-inflammatory effects of enteral diet components on Crohn's disease-affected 
      tissues in vitro.
PG  - 430-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The mechanism of action of elemental diet in Crohn's disease
      treatment, is unknown. Alteration of bacterial flora, low antigenicity, low fat
      content and improvement of nutritional status are postulated to play a role in
      the anti-inflammatory effect of elemental diet. AIM: To determine whether
      elemental diet or its modifications has a direct anti-inflammatory effect on
      colonic tissue biopsies in vitro. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Colonic or ileal biopsies
      from 39 patients with inflammatory bowel disease and control patients were
      incubated for 24 hours with enteral diets in which nitrogen sources were amino
      acids as in elemental diet, casein or whey. Tissues were incubated with elemental
      diet, casein or whey, at dilutions of 1:5, 1:10 or 1:20 in Waymouth's complete
      medium; a medium control was also included. Tissue viability was assessed by
      bromodeoxyuridine uptake. Interleukin-1beta, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist
      and interleukin-10 concentrations in supernatants were measured by immunoassay
      (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). RESULTS: Incubation of tissues from Crohn's 
      disease with elemental diet resulted in an increase in the ratio of interleukin-1
      receptor antagonist/interleukin-1beta vs control statistically significant at
      1:10 (89.6+/-17 vs 45.7+/-9. 1, p<0.05). Incubation of Crohn's tissue with casein
      resulted in a significant increase of interleukin-1 receptor
      antagonist/interleukin-1beta ratio at dilutions 1:20, 1:10 and 1:5 (101.8+/-22.0,
      p=0.05, 142.8+/-24.6, p<0.05; 109.7+/-25.0, p=0.05). In ulcerative colitis tissue
      and non-inflamed non-inflammatory bowel disease control tissue, no significant
      increase in interleukin 1 receptor antagonist/interleukin-1beta ratio was seen
      after incubation with elemental diet, casein and whey. CONCLUSION: Elemental diet
      incubation increases anti-inflammatory:proinflammatory cytokine ratio in Crohn's 
      disease and this anti-inflammatory effect is not specifically due to amino acid
      composition, as diets containing casein have similar anti-inflammatory effects.

TI  - The genetics of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 63-76
AB  - The complex genetics of IBD is characterized by more than one susceptibility
      locus, genetic heterogeneity, incomplete penetrance, and probable gene-gene and
      gene-environment interactions. Functional candidate gene association studies
      during the past few decades have revealed only modest associations between IBD
      and genetic variants in the HLA genes and a limited number of other genes that
      are involved in immune regulation and the inflammatory response. Important
      advances in IBD genetics research have come about from systematic genome searches
      for IBD loci. The identification of Crohn's disease-associated NOD2 genetic
      variants that appear to alter the innate immune response to bacteria is a seminal
      finding that perhaps is the greatest advance toward understanding the
      pathogenesis of IBD in decades. The future discovery of other IBD genetic risk
      factors, facilitated by the completion of the human genome sequencing and
      annotation, may allow the development of better therapies, possibly including
      preventive therapies, for patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Surgery for ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 219-35
AB  - The type of surgery performed for UC varies from patient to patient and must take
      into account the nutritional status and health of the patient, the presence of
      dysplasia or cancer, the desire of the patient to maintain continence, the
      preoperative anorectal function, the degree of confidence in the diagnosis of UC,
      and the technical constraint because of certain body habituses. A total
      proctocolectomy is the surgical procedure of choice for UC. A restorative
      proctocolectomy is the preferred surgical approach that not only cures the
      patient of the disease and prevents the development of colorectal cancer, but
      also maintains continence with an improved quality of life.

TI  - Nutritional factors in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 203-18
AB  - Dietary antigens may act as important stimuli of the mucosal immune system and
      have led to the study of nutritional therapy for IBD. Patients with active CD
      respond to bowel rest, along with total enteral nutrition or TPN. Bowel rest and 
      TPN are as effective as corticosteroids at inducing remission for patients with
      active CD, although benefits are short-lived. Enteral nutrition is consistently
      less effective than conventional corticosteroids for treatment of active CD. Use 
      of palatable, liquid polymeric diets in active CD is controversial, but these
      diets are of equal efficacy when compared with elemental diets. UC has not been
      treated effectively with either elemental diets or TPN. Fish oil contains
      n-3-PUFA, which inhibits production of proinflammatory cytokines and has some
      benefit in the treatment of CD. Topical applications of short-chain fatty acids
      have benefited diversion colitis and distal UC, whereas probiotics hold promise
      in the treatment of pouchitis.

      etiopathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. This review focuses on the most
      recent applications of medical therapy for ulcerative colitis. Therapeutic
      approaches continue to evolve regarding inductive and maintenance strategies with
      oral and topical aminosalicylates, systemic and non-systemic corticosteroids, and
      cyclosporine and alternative immunomodulators. As further investigations continue
      to discern microbiological and immunoinflammatory targets, future therapies may
      include both probiotics and novel biological agents.

TI  - Laparoscopic treatment of fulminant ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1778-82
AB  - BACKGROUND: The complexity and risks of the surgical treatment of ulcerative
      colitis are greater in patients with fulminant disease. Subtotal colectomy is
      frequently offered to such patients to control acute disease and restore
      immunological and nutritional status prior to a restorative procedure. The role
      of laparoscopy in this setting is poorly defined. METHODS: The records of 18
      patients with poorly controlled fulminant colitis on aggressive immunosuppressive
      therapy who underwent laparoscopic subtotal colectomy were reviewed. RESULTS:
      Postoperative complications occurred in six patients (33%). Postoperative length 
      of stay was 5.0 +/- 0.3 days vs 8.8 +/- 1.8 days (p<0.05) for a group of six
      patients who had undergone open subtotal colectomy for the same indications.
      Systemic steroids were withdrawn in all patients, and 17 patients subsequently
      underwent proctectomy and pelvic pouch construction. CONCLUSIONS: The relatively 
      high morbidity rate in these patients is likely related to their compromised
      status at the time of surgery. Laparoscopic subtotal colectomy in patients with
      fulminant ulcerative colitis allows for earlier hospital discharge, facilitates
      subsequent pelvic pouch, construction, and provides an excellent alternative to
      conventional two- and three-stage surgical treatment.

TI  - Different molecular events account for butyrate-induced apoptosis in two human
      colon cancer cell lines.
PG  - 1812-8
AB  - We studied the molecular events underlying butyrate-induced apoptosis in two
      different colon cancer cell lines: Caco-2, a well defined cancer cell and RSB, a 
      cell line obtained from a colonic tumor of an ulcerative colitis patient. Caco-2 
      and RSB cells were exposed to 2, 5 and 10 mmol/L butyrate for 48 h. Caspase-1 was
      cleaved in Caco-2-cells at all butyrate concentrations, whereas in RSB-cells
      caspase-1 expression was undetectable. In RSB cells, butyrate dose-dependently
      induced caspase-3 cleavage, whereas in Caco-2-cells, butyrate up-regulated
      expression of the caspase-3 active subunit. Caspase-3-specific activity,
      cytoplasmic nucleosome concentration and growth were directly correlated with
      butyrate doses in both cell lines; however, the response was more pronounced in
      Caco-2 than in RSB cells. Expression of the cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
      (PARP) product was elevated in both cell lines at the highest butyrate
      concentration. Bak expression gradually increased as a function of butyrate
      concentrations in both cell lines. At 10 mmol/L butyrate, expression increased by
      fivefold and sevenfold in Caco-2 and RSB cells, respectively. The highest
      expression of Bcl-2 was observed in control Caco-2 cells, and expression
      decreased with increasing butyrate concentration. This effect was not observed in
      RSB cells. Inactivation of caspase-1 with Z-YVAD-FMK abrogated butyrate-induced
      apoptosis in Caco-2 but not in RSB cells. Inactivation of caspase-3 with
      Z-DVED-FMK completely inhibited butyrate-induced apoptosis in RSB cells whereas
      this effect was less pronounced in Caco-2 cells. Our data demonstrate that
      butyrate-induced apoptosis is activated via different apoptotic pathways in
      diversely stratified colon cancers.

TI  - Complete small bowel recovery after prolonged total venous occlusion.
PG  - 175-6
AB  - Acute small bowel ischaemia is a mostly irreversible condition associated with
      high mortality. Here we report the case of a patient after severe abdominal
      trauma in whom the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) was completely occluded for
      more than 15 h in the absence of any collateral venous drainage. Following
      surgical reconstruction of the SMV and with scheduled relaparotomies for 5 days, 
      the bowel showed slow recovery. Now the patient is well and on complete oral
      nutrition.

TI  - Modification of enteral diets in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 457-61
AB  - The provision of food is thought to promote the maintenance of gut integrity.
      Nutrients are able to elicit and affect both systemic and mucosal immune
      responses. Enteral diet therapy has long been known to be efficacious in
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly in childhood Crohn's disease.
      However, the mechanisms of action of these diets are not clear. Nutritional
      repletion, direct effects on the gut mucosa or decreased intestinal permeability 
      have all been postulated as being important in nutritional therapy. There is some
      evidence that the enteral diet has a direct effect on the gut mucosa by reducing 
      cytokine production and the accompanying inflammation, thus leading to decreased 
      intestinal permeability. Modifications of enteral diet composition have been
      evaluated in many studies. Such modifications include fat and/or protein content 
      and the addition of bioactive peptides. The fatty acid composition of the enteral
      diet seems to have a much greater impact on its efficacy than modification of the
      N source. As specific fatty acids are precursors of inflammatory mediators
      derived from arachidonic acid, the reduction in these components may be
      beneficial in nutritional therapy for IBD. Addition of bioactive peptides to
      enteral diet formulas may also have a role; such peptides may have specific
      growth factor or anti-inflammatory actions. There is still much work to be done
      to define disease-specific enteral diet formulas that are effective as therapies 
      for both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

AB  - Malnutrition and specific vitamin and mineral deficiency together with growth
      retardation in children and delay in sexual maturation accompained Crohns disease
      and ulcerative colitis regularly. Supportive role of nutrition is to correct
      malnutrition, to heal specific nutritional deficiencies and enable normal growth,
      development and sexual maturation of children. Enteral nutrition, however, could 
      be a primary therapeutical aspect as a change for pharmacological treatment. In
      this role, as succesful as steroids, initiate remmission in patients with
      intermediate or severe forms of disease without steroid like side. In adults,
      three meta-analyses confirmed therapeutical effects of enteral nutrition with
      remission rate of 60%, although steroids were more successful. These reports were
      valid only in Crohns disease. In ulcerative colitis neither parenteral or enteral
      nutrition had therapeutical effects without other types of treatment.

PG  - 469-77
AB  - UNLABELLED: Pancreatitis in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children is
      anecdotal. In adults, symptomatic pancreatitis occurs in 2% and asymptomatic in 8
      to 21%. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The aim of our study was to review retrospectively 
      the frequency of pancreatitis in 124 pediatric patients (54.8% boys, 45.2% girls;
      97 with Crohn disease, 16 with ulcerative colitis and 11 with undetermined
      colitis). Diagnostic criterion of pancreatitis was an increase of amylasemia > or
      = +2 SD of the normal with or without evocative clinical symptoms. RESULTS:
      Symptomatic or asymptomatic pancreatitis was found in 27% (respectively 14.5 and 
      12.5%). Pancreatitis was significantly more frequent in girls as compared to boys
      (P = 0.04). Symptomatic pancreatitis was moderate and non complicated, often
      recurrent. It occurred mainly during active and severe diseases (P = 0.006). The 
      localizations of IBD were not discriminant. Strong relation with drug was found
      in 25% of pancreatitis mainly due to azathioprine or 5-aminosalicylic acid, and
      salazopyrin. Duodenal localisation of Crohn disease or hepatobiliary
      complications were found associated with pancreatitis in 18% and 15%
      respectively. CONCLUSION: These data suggest the high incidence of symptomatic
      and asymptomatic pancreatitis in children with IBD, the importance of its regular
      monitoring but also its multifactorial causes. Precise diagnosis of pancreatitis 
      in pediatric IBD has to be done in order to avoid inappropriate drug pancreatitis
      diagnosis.

      and ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 53-8
AB  - Most patients with inflammatory bowel disease can be managed with conventional
      immunosuppressive therapy. The choice of agents to prevent relapses of
      inflammatory bowel disease must be based on efficacy, toxicity and cost. Studies 
      in animal models of inflammatory bowel disease indicate that chronic intestinal
      inflammation results from enhanced immune responses to bacteria that are present 
      normally in the lumen. Loss of tolerance, an abnormal function or defective
      healing of the mucosal barrier may all give raise to chronic intestinal
      inflammation. This hypothesis is the basis of new therapies aimed at either
      decreasing the levels of luminal bacterial antigens and/or selectively blocking
      detrimental mucosal immune responses. Anti-TNF is an example of this novel
      approach that is very effective in Crohn's disease. The use of biological therapy
      is costly, however, and the long-term complications are not yet known. The recent
      increase of tuberculosis in patients treated with anti-TNF indicates that careful
      monitoring is necessary. It is clear that the new forms of treatment may play an 
      important role in tailoring the appropriate drug to a specific group of patients.
      However, for the time being, fine-tuning in the use of conventional
      immunosuppression is necessary. New knowledge in the pharmacogenetics of these
      compounds allows improvements to be made in their use. It is to be hoped that a
      critical approach in the use of current and future drugs, taking into account the
      advances in the aetiopathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, will contribute 
      to the quality of life of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Effect of dietary inulin supplementation on inflammation of pouch mucosa in
      patients with an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis.
PG  - 621-7
AB  - PURPOSE: Inflammation is a constant finding in the ileal reservoir of patients
      with an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis and is associated with decreased fecal
      concentrations of the short chain fatty acid butyrate, increased fecal pH,
      changes in fecal flora, and increased concentrations of secondary bile acids. In 
      healthy subjects, inulin, a dietary fiber, is fermented to short chain fatty
      acids and leads to a lower pH and potentially beneficial changes in fecal flora. 
      The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of enteral
      supplementation of inulin on inflammation of the ileal reservoir. METHODS: Twenty
      patients received 24 g of inulin or placebo daily during three weeks in a
      randomized, double-blind, crossover design. Stools were analyzed after each test 
      period for pH, short chain fatty acids, microflora, and bile acids. Inflammation 
      was assessed endoscopically, histologically, and clinically. RESULTS: Compared
      with placebo, three weeks of dietary supplementation with 24 g of inulin
      increased butyrate concentrations, lowered pH, decreased numbers of Bacteroides
      fragilis, and diminished concentrations of secondary bile acids in feces. This
      was endoscopically and histologically accompanied by a reduction of inflammation 
      of the mucosa of the ileal reservoir. CONCLUSION: Enteral inulin supplementation 
      leads to a decrease of inflammation-associated factors and to a reduction of
      inflammation of pouch mucosa.

TI  - Immunomodulatory therapy for pediatric inflammatory bowel disease: changing
      patterns of use, 1990-2000.
PG  - 928-32
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify changes over the past decade in physicians' attitudes
      regarding the use of immunomodulatory agents for the treatment of children with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we surveyed the membership of the North
      American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition and compared the
      responses to those from an identical survey performed in 1990. METHODS: Surveys
      were mailed to 718 physicians in January, 2000. All surveys returned by
      mid-February were analyzed, and results compared to those obtained in the 1990
      survey. RESULTS: Thirty-nine percent (278/718) of surveys were returned, compared
      to 27% (105/385) in 1990. Overall, 93% of the current survey's respondents agreed
      with the statement "immunomodulatory agents are effective in the treatment of
      children and adolescents with IBD." Compared to 1990, significant increases (p < 
      0.0001) were noted in the percentage of respondents who prescribe
      immunomodulatory agents to children with all forms of IBD. Indications for
      immunomodulation that showed significant increases (p < 0.001) since 1990
      included treatment of perianal and non-perianal fistulae; growth failure; use as 
      initial, primary therapy; and use as prophylaxis against postoperative
      recurrence. 6-Mercaptopurine and azathioprine continue to be the agents
      prescribed by the greatest percentage of respondents. More physicians are willing
      to use immunomodulatory agents in children younger than 5 yr, and duration of use
      is longer than in 1990. Currently, physicians seem to favor the use of
      immunomodulatory agents over colectomy for children with either intractable
      ulcerative or Crohn's colitis. Most respondents remain concerned about potential 
      bone marrow and immune suppression, but concerns regarding malignancy,
      teratogenicity, and infertility have lessened. CONCLUSION: These survey findings 
      document that pediatric gastroenterologists have widely accepted the use of
      immunomodulators in the treatment of children and adolescents with IBD.

TI  - Serological markers in inflammatory bowel disease: the pros and cons.
PG  - 103-5
AB  - Accurate serological assays are desirable for the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel
      disease. Among several serological markers anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae mannan
      antibodies and perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies are highly
      disease specific for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, respectively.
      Combining the two improves their specificity. Sensitivity, however, is still low.
      Due to lack of standardization and vast interobserver variability, they cannot be
      used as the only diagnostic criteria but can assist clinicians in diagnosing and 
      categorizing patients with inflammatory bowel disease as well as in helping them 
      to take therapeutic decisions.

TI  - Infliximab as a novel therapy for pediatric ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 307-11
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The role of infliximab (anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha antibody)
      therapy in ulcerative colitis (UC) is not well defined. There are only two
      reports published describing its use in UC. The authors describe their experience
      with open-label use of infliximab in children with moderate to severe UC.
      METHODS: The authors collected data on all consecutive pediatric patients with UC
      who received infliximab at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia until July
      2001. The primary measured outcome was clinical response at 2 days and 2 weeks
      after infliximab infusion, as measured by the Lichtiger colitis activity index
      (LCAI) score and the Physician Global Assessment (PGA). Tolerance of the
      infusions and adverse events were recorded. RESULTS: Nine patients qualified for 
      clinical response analysis. The median Lichtiger colitis activity index score
      decreased from 11 before the infusion to 1 at 2 days and 2 weeks after the
      infusion, respectively (P = 0.01 for 2 days and 2 weeks). Seven of nine (77%)
      patients had decreased activity of their disease measured by the Physician Global
      Assessment. Corticosteroid therapy was discontinued in six (66%) patients. An
      infusion reaction developed (generalized pruritus and facial flushing) in two
      patients and an elevated anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) titer of 1:1280 developed in
      one patient. CONCLUSION: Infliximab is associated with short-term clinical
      improvement in children and adolescents with moderate to severe UC.

TI  - Total dose intravenous infusion of iron dextran for iron-deficiency anemia in
      children with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 286-90
AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron-deficiency anemia is a frequent complication in children with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Parenteral iron therapy is rarely prescribed
      because of concern about potential side effects. The aim of this study was to
      retrospectively evaluate the safety and efficacy of total dose intravenous (TDI) 
      iron therapy. METHODS: Charts of all the pediatric patients with IBD who received
      TDI iron therapy between February of 1994 and February of 2000 were reviewed.
      RESULTS: Seventy patients (20 with ulcerative colitis and 50 with Crohn disease) 
      received a total of 119 TDI iron dextran infusions. Thirty-four patients
      qualified for the efficacy analysis. The average increase in hemoglobin
      concentration was 2.9 g/dL, (P < 0.0001). Eleven immediate hypersensitivity
      reactions developed in 10 patients (9% of the total number of infusions). None of
      the reactions was life threatening and none required hospitalization.
      CONCLUSIONS: Total dose intravenous infusion of iron dextran, when appropriately 
      used, is a safe and potentially efficacious treatment for children with
      inflammatory bowel disease and iron deficiency anemia who are unresponsive to or 
      noncompliant with oral iron therapy.

TI  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli infection induces interleukin-8 production via
      activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and the transcription factors
      NF-kappaB and AP-1 in T84 cells.
PG  - 2304-10
AB  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) infections are associated with
      hemorrhagic colitis and the hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). In vivo, elevated
      plasma levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) in
      EHEC-infected children are correlated with a high risk of developing HUS. As IL-8
      gene transcription is regulated by the transcription factors NF-kappaB and AP-1, 
      we analyzed the role of these factors in the regulation of IL-8 production after 
      infection of the epithelial intestinal T84 cell line by EHEC. By 6 h of
      infection, EHEC had induced significant secretion of IL-8 (35.84 +/- 6.76 ng/ml
      versus 0.44 +/- 0.04 ng/ml in control cells). EHEC induced AP-1 and NF-kappaB
      activation by 3 h of infection. Moreover, the three mitogen-activated protein
      kinases (MAPK) (ERK1/2, p38, and JNK) were phosphorylated in EHEC-infected T84
      cells concomitant with induction of AP-1 DNA binding activity, and IkappaB-alpha 
      was phosphorylated and then degraded concomitant with induction of NF-kappaB DNA 
      binding activity. Pretreatment of cells with the highly specific MEK1/2 inhibitor
      U0126, the p38 inhibitor SB203580, and/or the proteasome inhibitor ALLN led to
      inhibition of the IL-8 secretion induced in EHEC-infected T84 cells. These
      findings demonstrate that (i) EHEC can induce in vitro a potent proinflammatory
      response by secretion of IL-8 and (ii) the secretion of IL-8 is due to the
      involvement of MAPK, AP-1, and NF-kappaB signaling pathways.

TI  - Dietary protein enterocolitis.
PG  - 76-9
AB  - Dietary protein enterocolitis generally presents in the 1st year of life with
      diarrhea, emesis, and irritability. When there is a delay in diagnosis,
      persistent exposure to the offending dietary antigen leads to increasing enteric 
      inflammation manifesting as bloody diarrhea, anemia, dehydration, and failure to 
      sustain normal patterns of weight gain and growth. The extent of enteric
      inflammation may be limited to mild proctitis, pancolitis, or true enterocolitis 
      with esophagitis, gastritis, enteropathy, and colitis. The offending antigen is
      usually cow's milk protein or soy protein. A significant number of the infants
      are exclusively breast fed, especially those with proctitis. In older children, a
      wide variety of dietary proteins have been implicated. The inconsistency between 
      allergists and gastroenterologists in the clinical definition of the syndrome
      remains a significant problem. To the allergist, the definition is based on
      clinical criteria, allergy testing, and response to double-blind food challenge, 
      whereas to the gastroenterologist, it is defined by histologic criteria and the
      response of clinical and histologic manifestations to elimination diets. To
      further complicate the issue, European studies have emphasized the alterations in
      enteric permeability noted in both enteropathy and enterocolitis. In an effort to
      establish a unified approach, the International Life Sciences Institute sponsored
      a workshop in late 1998, which resulted in a document entitled "Classification of
      Gastrointestinal Disease of Infants and Children Due to Adverse Immunologic
      Reactions."

TI  - [Nutrition in chronic inflammatory bowl diseases. What your patient tolerates is 
      permitted].
PG  - 40-3
AB  - Modifying the diet can have a favorable impact on the course of chronic
      inflammatory bowel disease. In contrast, nutrition plays no major role in the
      development of the disease or in provoking an acute attack. During an acute
      attack of Crohn's disease, the application of oral (drinks) or tube feeding
      (enteral nutrition) can result in a substantial clinical improvement. The
      remission rate of this side effect-free therapy is, however, lower than that seen
      with steroids. The data available for diet therapy in ulcerative colitis are less
      unequivocal, but the effects are probably slight at best. During the remission
      phase, the patient should eat a balanced, vitamin-rich and varied normal diet
      that excludes all poorly tolerated foods: lactose intolerance in particular
      appears to be increased in patients with Crohn's disease. Known vitamin or
      mineral deficiencies should be corrected by appropriate dietary measures or
      supplementation. There is no such thing as a "Crohn's diet" or "colitis diet".
      The patient can be allowed to eat anything that is tolerated.

TI  - Centrilobular necrosis in children after combined liver and small bowel
      transplantation.
PG  - 252-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Centrilobular necrosis is not an uncommon finding after isolated
      liver transplantation. In this study, we sought to describe hepatic centrilobular
      necrosis in children after combined liver and small bowel transplantation (LSBT),
      and to assess the predictive factors, possible causes, and prognosis. METHODS:
      Six children aged 4 to 11 years, in whom liver biopsy showed centrilobular
      necrosis at least once, 3 weeks to 2 years after LSBT, were compared with nine
      children without this pathology. All six children experienced an acute
      complication in the few weeks preceding the finding of centrilobular necrosis. In
      addition, one child had an early arterial thrombosis and one, severe colitis 3
      years after LSBT. RESULTS: Centrilobular necrosis was associated with
      centrilobular swelling, dropout, endotheliitis, and inflammation. Fibrosis
      developed early and worsened on follow-up biopsy in three children. Portal
      symptoms of acute rejection were not constant, and there was no ductopenia.
      Biologic abnormalities were responsive to increased immunosuppression, including 
      mycophenolate in four cases. However, follow-up biopsies showed persistent
      lesions in five patients, mildly inflammatory in four. Baseline immunosuppression
      had to be maintained at high levels. No viral infections, vascular compromise
      (except in one), and autoimmunity were found. We compared the two groups of
      children for initial diagnosis, age at transplantation, time receiving parenteral
      nutrition, ischemic time, presence of an associated transplanted colon, number of
      reoperations and infections, intestinal rejection, and immunosuppression, and
      found no differences. CONCLUSIONS: This severe manifestation of chronic liver
      rejection occurred despite the heavy immunosuppression needed for LSBT. The
      previous acute clinical event could have triggered rejection by modifying the
      effective immunosuppression at the tissue level. Despite high baseline
      immunosuppression, histologic lesions persisted and significant fibrosis
      developed in half the children. We speculate that the lack of induction of
      tolerance in this particular setting of LSBT could be responsible for constant
      immune stimulation, thus chronic rejection. The optimal protocol of
      immunosuppression has yet to be defined to avoid this complication.

TI  - [Collagen gastroenterocolitis].
PG  - 1927-9
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Collagenous gastroenterocolitis is a recently known rare cause of
      chronic diarrhoea, that raises numerous nosological and diagnostic problems.
      OBSERVATION: A 41 year-old woman was hospitalised for severe diarrhoea, diagnosed
      as collagenous gastroenterocolitis. Gastroscopy and ileocolonoscopy were
      macroscopically normal, but a 20 to 40 microns thick sub-epithelial collagenous
      band was revealed in the gastric, duodenal and colic biopsies. Parenteral
      nutrition and treatment with salazopyrine and prednisolone progressively
      normalised the transit. Three months later, only a 30 microns colic mucosa
      collagenous band persisted. All the biopsies taken during control
      gastro-colonoscopy 2 years later were histologically normal. After 5 years
      follow-up and absence of treatment, the patient no longer presented diarrhoea or 
      biological abnormality. COMMENTS: This exceptional observation is a reminder that
      sub-epithelial collagen deposits are not always limited to the colon and
      therefore justify, in patients with collagenous colitis, systematic
      gastro-duodenal and ileum biopsies.

      reference to the differential diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.
PG  - S117-22
AB  - Neurological manifestations of gastrointestinal disorders are described, with
      particular reference to those resembling multiple sclerosis (MS) on clinical or
      MRI grounds. Patients with celiac disease can present cerebellar ataxia,
      progressive myoclonic ataxia, myelopathy, or cerebral, brainstem and peripheral
      nerve involvement. Antigliadin antibodies can be found in subjects with
      neurological dysfunction of unknown cause, particularly in sporadic cerebellar
      ataxia ("gluten ataxia"). Patients with Whipple's disease can develop mental and 
      psychiatric changes, supranuclear gaze palsy, upper motoneuron signs,
      hypothalamic dysfunction, cranial nerve abnormalities, seizures, ataxia,
      myorhythmia and sensory deficits. Neurological manifestations can complicate
      inflammatory bowel disease (e.g. ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) due to
      vascular or vasculitic mechanisms. Cases with both Crohn's disease and MS or
      cerebral vasculitis are described. Epilepsy, chronic inflammatory polyneuropathy,
      muscle involvement and myasthenia gravis are also reported. The central nervous
      system can be affected in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection because
      of vasculitis associated with HCV-related cryoglobulinemia. Mitochondrial
      neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy (MNGIE) is a disease caused by multiple
      deletions of mitochondrial DNA. It is characterized by peripheral neuropathy,
      ophthalmoplegia, deafness, leukoencephalopathy, and gastrointestinal symptoms due
      to visceral neuropathy. Neurological manifestations can be the consequence of
      vitamin B1, nicotinamide, vitamin B12, vitamin D, or vitamin E deficiency and
      from nutritional deficiency states following gastric surgery.

TI  - [Toxic megacolon].
PG  - 619-23
AB  - Toxic megacolon belongs to the severe acute complications of inflammatory bowel
      diseases. The frequency is 1.6-21.4% among patients with ulcerative colitis and
      0.3-2% in those with Crohn's disease. The main characteristics of toxic megacolon
      are toxemia, sepsis and distension of the colon due to the diminished muscular
      tone, loss of motor activity and increased amount of colonic gas. Sepsis and/or
      perforation of the large bowel can complicate this situation. The most important 
      diagnostic procedure is the abdominal X-ray. Should the diameter of colonic
      distension exceed 60 mm, the diagnosis of toxic megacolon has been confirmed.
      Conservative treatment of toxic megacolon consists of water and electrolyte
      replacement, total parenteral nutrition, administration of corticosteroids and
      broad-spectrum antibiotics and repeat patient's prone positioning. If medical
      therapy is not successful during the first 72 hours, surgical intervention is
      indicated. The most common procedure is subtotal colonic resection with creation 
      of an ileostomy. Patients with toxic megacolon should be managed at specialised
      centers, where cooperation of experienced gastroenterologists, surgeons and
      intensive care experts is possible.

TI  - Treatment of inflammatory bowel disease in childhood.
PG  - 48-50
AB  - Of all patients with Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis, the first presentation
      of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is at a paediatric or adolescent age in 20%
      to 30%, most children being prepubertal at diagnosis. It is essential to provide 
      an accurate diagnosis in children suspected of IBD, as the initial treatment of
      Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis in children is not the same as it is in
      adults. While the role of enteral feeding in the treatment of Crohn disease in
      adults continues to be controversial, there is firm evidence to support the use
      of enteral feeding as primary therapy for Crohn disease in children. Nutrition is
      improved by enteral feeding, and growth and pubertal development are promoted,
      while the systemic toxicity of corticosteroid therapy is avoided. Supplementary
      nocturnal enteral nutrition (with daytime intake of normal diet) after primary
      therapy and remission induction may be associated with the prolongation of
      remission. Drug treatment in children with IBD is characterized by a lack of
      evidence from controlled trials.

TI  - The bacterial flora in inflammatory bowel disease: current insights in
      pathogenesis and the influence of antibiotics and probiotics.
PG  - 29-40
AB  - The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains unknown, although in
      recent years more data have become available. The contribution of genetic and
      environmental factors is evident, and the luminal bacterial flora plays a major
      role in the initiation and perpetuation of chronic IBD. Animal models of IBD have
      shown that colitis does not occur in a germ-free environment. In human IBD,
      inflammation is present in parts of the gut containing the highest bacterial
      concentrations. Moreover, the terminal ileum, caecum and rectum are areas of
      relative stasis, providing prolonged mucosal contact with luminal contents.
      Enhanced mucosal permeability may play a pivotal role in maintaining a chronic
      inflammatory state, due to a genetic predisposition or as a result of direct
      contact with bacteria or their products. A detective epithelial barrier may cause
      a loss of tolerance to the normal enteric flora. Furthermore, an increased
      mucosal absorption of viable bacteria and bacterial products is found in IBD.
      Serum and secreted antibodies are increased and mucosal T-lymphocytes that
      recognize luminal bacteria are present. However, there is evidence that the
      immune system reacts over aggressively towards the normal luminal flora rather
      than the flora being altered in IBD. Several approaches have been used in
      attempts to discover a specific microbial agent in the cause of IBD. These
      include demonstration of the presence of organisms or specific antigens in
      affected tissues, culture of microbes firm the affected tissues, demonstration of
      serological responses to several agents, and localization and detection of
      individual pathogen-specific nucleic acid sequences in affected tissue by in situ
      hybridization and polymerase chain reaction. So far, no specific micro-organism
      has been directly associated with the pathogenesis of IBD. Analysis of the
      luminal enteric flora, however, has revealed differences in the composition of
      this flora compared to healthy controls. In Crohn disease, concentrations of
      Bacteroides, Eubacteria and Peptostreptococcus are increased, whereas
      Bifidobacteria numbers are significantly reduced. Furthermore, in ulcerative
      colitis, concentrations of facultative anaerobic bacteria are increased. The
      arrival of new molecular techniques qualifying and quantifying the complex
      intestinal flora has induced a revival of interest in this microflora.
      Therapeutic approaches geared towards changing the environment at the mucosal
      border have been attempted by the use of elemental diets, total parenteral
      nutrition, surgical diversion of the faecal stream and antibiotics. Over the past
      few years, the use of probiotics in IBD and other intestinal disorders has gained
      attention. Strengthened by promising experimental data and commercial interests, 
      research in this field is rapidly expanding. Manipulation of the colonic bacteria
      with antibiotic drugs and probiotic agents may prove to be more effective and
      better tolerated than immunosuppressants in the future.

TI  - [Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies in patients with Crohn's disease].
PG  - 2303-7
AB  - Inflammatory Bowel Diseases are a group of diseases with chronic inflammation of 
      the gastrointestinal tract, but without proven etiology. Immunologic,
      environmental, infective and genetic factors equally can play role in their
      development. Antibodies to an oligomannose epitope of the Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae demonstrated in 60-70% of the patients with Crohn's disease. The
      origin and the clinicopathological role are not clarified. It is important that
      there are no surveys with patients suffering in gluten sensitive enteropathy in
      the literature. As there are no ASCA survey in Hungary, the aim of this study was
      to determine the prevalence of the ASCA. The authors examined at their patients
      the ASCA's occurrence and compared with the clinical picture of the Crohn's
      disease. The results supported the theory that ASCA positivity correlates with
      small intestines' Crohn's disease and in these cases both the IgG and IgA type
      antibodies proved. The antibodies in the sera at the analyzed ASCA positive cases
      prove a systemic immune response against Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the authors
      suggest the end of the oral tolerance against the yeast's antigens. The diet
      restriction (elemental diet, total parenteral nutrition, and fecal diversion) may
      ameliorate the status of the patients with Crohn's disease. It is speculated that
      the yeast-free diet as a part of the therapy for the ASCA positive patients can
      be reasonable: moreover the permanent "forbidding" of the yeast can be an
      acceptable alternative in case of getting well.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease associated with immune thrombocytopenic purpura in
      children.
PG  - 582-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous reports suggest an association between inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) and immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) in adults. To date, only 
      five children with both diseases have been described. The aim of the study was to
      describe the characteristics of children with IBD and ITP. METHODS: Cases were
      obtained from the pediatric gastroenterology community by means of the pediatric 
      gastroenterology internet bulletin board in June 1999. Eight cases were submitted
      from seven medical centers. Medical records were reviewed by two pediatric
      gastroenterologists and a pediatric hematologist. RESULTS: The age range of the
      patients was 2.1 to 16.5 years, with a mean age of 9.6 +/- 5.2 years. Four
      children had ulcerative colitis, three had Crohn disease, and one had
      indeterminate colitis. All had colonic involvement of IBD. Of eight patients,
      three had IBD first, three had ITP first, and two had both simultaneously. At ITP
      diagnosis, platelet count was less than 10,000/mL in five children, 17,000/mL in 
      one child, and 50,000 to 60,000/mL in two children. Of the three children
      diagnosed with ITP first, two initially had rectal bleeding at the time of ITP
      diagnosis. Bone marrow evaluations, performed in six of eight children, were
      consistent with ITP. Six of the eight children had chronic ITP, including three
      children who were 5 years of age or younger. Therapy for ITP included steroids (n
      = 6), intravenous immunoglobulin (n = 6), Rh o (D) intravenous immunoglobulin (n 
      = 2), and splenectomy (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS: The authors describe the largest
      pediatric case series of children with IBD and ITP. More than 50% of the children
      had the chronic form of ITP. Most patients responded to conventional therapy for 
      ITP and IBD.

TI  - Elevated serum hepatocyte growth factor in children and young adults with
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 548-53
AB  - BACKGROUND: Elevated serum levels of several potent angiogenesis factors,
      including vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor
      have been described in children with active inflammatory bowel disease.
      Angiogenesis-promoting cytokines may promote inflammation by increasing vascular 
      permeability but also mediate tissue repair by activating fibroblasts. Hepatocyte
      growth factor (HGF) is another angiogenesis-promoting cytokine that is increased 
      in colon cancer tissues. We therefore evaluated serum HGF levels in individuals
      with Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Serum samples were obtained
      from 60 patients with Crohn disease, 31 with ulcerative colitis, and 38 controls 
      with functional abdominal pain and other gastrointestinal illnesses. Disease
      activity for Crohn disease patients was determined using the pediatric Crohn
      disease activity index, and for ulcerative colitis patients using the Kozarek
      score. The HGF levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
      RESULTS: Serum HGF levels were significantly ( P < 0.001) higher for Crohn
      disease patients (1439 +/- 84 pg/mL) and ulcerative colitis patients (1384 +/-
      107 pg/mL) than for control patients (807 +/- 50 pg/mL). Serum HGF levels also
      rose with increasing disease activity in individuals with both Crohn disease and 
      ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSION: Serum HGF is elevated in children and young
      adults who have Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis. Levels of serum HGF
      correlate directly with disease activity. The raised serum HGF suggests that HGF 
      may mediate angiogenesis and vascular permeability in the mucosa of children with
      inflammatory bowel disease. Alternatively, the raised serum HGF may be an
      epiphenomenon of inflammation.

TI  - Nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 561-9
AB  - Nutritional derangements are frequent in inflammatory bowel disease. In the past 
      year significant work has been published examining the mechanisms of impaired
      food intake in animal models of inflammatory bowel disease, which allow a better 
      understanding of these processes. Data from the same laboratory have shed further
      light on the relative role of underfeeding and inflammation on the growth
      retardation associated with intestinal inflammation. Other studies have provided 
      further data on the risk factors and predictive biomarkers of bone loss in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The potential role of enteral nutrition
      as primary therapy for Crohn's disease is particularly addressed in this review. 
      Recent contributions to the field emphasized the special importance of this
      modality of therapy in paediatric patients. The possible mechanisms for such a
      therapeutic action are not well understood. Other nutrients may have a
      therapeutic potential in inflammatory bowel disease. In particular, recent data
      on the in-vivo anti-inflammatory actions of butyrate merit special mention.
      Finally, novel nutritional therapeutic strategies for inflammatory bowel disease,
      such as transforming growth factor-beta2-enriched enteral feeding, or
      hydrothermally processed cereals have recently been explored.

TI  - Beneficial role for folate in the prevention of colorectal and breast cancer.
PG  - 98-105
AB  - Folate is involved in the synthesis of nucleotides and amino acid metabolism such
      as methylation of homocysteine to methionine. Methionine is activated by
      adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to produce S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the primary
      intracellular methyl donor. Thus, folate is essential for the synthesis,
      methylation, and repair of DNA. With regard to its biochemical function it has
      been hypothesized that a diminished folate status may contribute to
      carcinogenesis by alteration of gene expression and increased DNA damage. Animal 
      and human studies support this hypothesis, particularly with respect to
      colorectal cancer. Epidemiological evidence for the association between folate
      status and cancer was first observed among ulcerative colitis patients. Several
      case-control studies demonstrated reduction in colorectal cancer risk with better
      folate status. Two large, prospective cohort studies support the concept that
      high folate intake is protective against colon cancer. In contrast to colorectal 
      cancer, the potential association of folate status and risk has been less
      investigated in breast cancer. Recently, convincing epidemiological data
      establishing a positive effect of folate status on breast cancer risk were
      published. This review summarizes the epidemiological evidence for the
      association between folate status and colorectal and breast cancer risk. In
      addition, a short overview is given on the discussed mechanism(s) by which folate
      might be involved in carcinogenesis.

PG  - 641-57, vi
AB  - Since its introduction into clinical use, flexible fiberoptic endoscopy
      progressively has become an indispensable tool to diagnose and treat
      gastrointestinal disorders. Few innovations have had a greater impact on the
      clinical practice of gastroenterology. In effect, diagnostic endoscopy has become
      an extension of physical diagnosis. This article reviews the expanding use of
      endoscopy in inflammatory bowel disease in the pediatric age group.

TI  - Delayed puberty and response to testosterone in a rat model of colitis.
PG  - R1483-91
AB  - Delayed puberty is a frequent complication of inflammatory bowel disease. The
      precise etiological mechanisms are not known. In this study, we wanted to
      determine the relative contribution of undernutrition and inflammation to delayed
      puberty and the effect of inflammation on the reproductive axis. Puberty was
      assessed in rats with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid induced-colitis, healthy
      controls, and animals pair fed to match the food intake of the colitic group. The
      response to testosterone administration was assessed in colitic rats. We found
      that induction of colitis was associated with hypophagia and reduced weight gain,
      and undernutrition in healthy females (i.e., pair fed) resulted in a delay in the
      onset (by 4.8 days, P < 0.001) and progression of puberty (normal estrous cycles 
      in 42%, P = 0.04) compared with controls. However, puberty was further delayed in
      the colitic group (1.4 days after pair fed) with the absence of normal estrous
      cycling in all rats. In males, the onset of puberty was also delayed, and weights
      of accessory sex organs were reduced compared with pair-fed controls. Plasma
      testosterone concentrations were low, and gonadotropin concentrations were normal
      in colitic rats. Testosterone treatment normalized puberty in male rats with
      colitis. In conclusion, in rats with experimental colitis, inflammation appears
      to potentiate the effect of undernutrition on puberty. The weights of secondary
      sex organs and the onset of puberty were normalized by testosterone treatment.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease: clinics and pathology. Do inflammatory bowel disease 
      and periodontal disease have similar immunopathogeneses?
PG  - 235-43
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) comprises two chronic, tissue-destructive,
      clinical entities Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) both apparently 
      caused by immunological overreaction (hypersensitivity) to commensal gut
      bacteria. Under normal conditions the intestinal immune system shows a
      down-regulating tone ('oral tolerance') against dietary antigens and the
      indigenous microbiota. This local homeostasis is disturbed in IBD, leading to
      hyperactivation of T helper 1 (Th1) cells with abundant secretion of
      interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and production of IgG antibodies
      against commensal bacteria. In addition, UC includes genetically determined
      autoimmunity, particularly IgG1-mediated cytotoxic epithelial attack. Breaching
      of the epithelium is the best-defined event underlying abrogation of oral
      tolerance, but immune deviation caused by cytokines fiom irritated epithelial
      cells or subepithelial elements (for example, mast cells, natural killer cells,
      macrophages) may also be involved. Endogenous infection with local
      hypersensitivity likewise causes periodontal disease, reflecting 'frustrated'
      immune elimination mechanisms entertained by antigens from dental plaque.
      Altogether, perturbation of a tightly controlled cytokine network, with abnormal 
      crosstalk between several cell types, apparently explains the progressive
      immunopathology of chronic inflammatory mucosal diseases in general. This adverse
      development will be influenced by numerous immunity genes, the dosage and
      potential pathogeniciy of commensal bacteria, general health, nutritional status,
      and psychological factors. Several targets for new therapy have tentatively been 
      identified to block immunopathological mechanisms in IBD, and inhibition of TNF
      has a striking beneficial effect in CD, supporting a central role of this
      cytokine.

TI  - Abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
PG  - 335-44
AB  - Newer, minimally invasive catheter-based endovascular technology utilizing stent 
      grafts are currently being evaluated for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. 
      A retrospective review of all (3 years) consecutive, non-ruptured elective AAA
      repairs was undertaken to document the results of AAA surgical repair in a modern
      cohort of patients to allow a contemporary comparison with the evolving
      endoluminal data. One hundred twenty-one AAAs were identified in a male veteran
      population. Mean age was 68.5 +/-7.7 years. Medical history review showed
      hypertension in 55%, heart disease in 73.5%, peripheral vascular disease in 21%, 
      stroke and transient ischemic attacks in 22%, diabetes mellitus in 7%, renal
      insufficiency in 10%, and smoking history in 80%. The AAA size was documented
      with ultrasound (5.2 +/-1.3 cm, n=40) and computed tomography (5.6 +/-1.3 cm,
      n=100). Fifty-nine percent had angiography. Intraoperative end points included an
      operative time of 165 +/-6.3 minutes from incision to dressing placement. A
      Dacron tube graft was used in 78%, the remaining were Dacron bifurcated grafts. A
      suprarenal clamp was used in 8% for proximal aortic control with juxtarenal
      aneurysms. A pulmonary-artery catheter was placed in 69%. A transverse incision
      was used in 69% of patients and a midline incision was used in the rest.
      Estimated blood loss was 1505 +/-103 mL; cell saver blood returned 754 +/-53 mL; 
      crystalloid/Hespan 4771 +/-176 mL; banked packed red blood cells 0.75 +/-0.11 U. 
      Time to extubation was, in the operating room (78.5%), on the day of the
      operation (5.0%), postoperative day (POD) 1 (12.4%), POD2 (1.7%), POD3 (0.8%),
      and one case was performed with epidural anesthesia only. Postoperative end
      points included a 30-day mortality rate of 1.6% (two patients). Postoperative
      morbidity included wound dehiscence 0.8%; sepsis, urinary tract infection, wound 
      infection, leg ischemia, ischemic colitis, and stroke each had an incidence of
      1.6%; myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, pneumonia, re-operation
      for suspected bleeding, and ileus or bowel obstruction occurred with an incidence
      of 3.3%. No significant increase in serum creatinine levels was noted. Time to
      enteral fluids/nutrition was 3.5 +/-0.08 days. Patients were out of bed to a
      chair or walking by 1.3 +/-0.06 days postoperatively. The length of stay in the
      intensive care unit (ICU) was 2.0 +/-0.12 days and postoperative hospital stay
      was 6.6 +/- 0.33 days. Transfusion requirement for the hospital stay was 1.6
      +/-0.2 U per patient. This review highlights a cohort of male veteran patients
      with significant cardiac co-morbidity who have undergone repair with a
      conventional open technique and low mortality and morbidity rates. This group had
      rapid extubation, time to oral intake, and ambulation. In addition, ICU and
      hospital stays were relatively short.

TI  - Review article: balsalazide therapy in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1549-54
AB  - Balsalazide is a 5-aminosalicylic acid (mesalazine) pro-drug which has an inert
      carrier molecule instead of the sulfapyridine moiety of sulfasalazine. It is
      designed to deliver 5-aminosalicylic acid to the colonic mucosa without the
      sulfapyridine-associated side-effects encountered with sulfasalazine. Several
      studies have confirmed the efficacy and patient tolerance of balsalazide. When
      compared to mesalazine at equivalent doses, it induced symptomatic and complete
      remission of acute ulcerative colitis in a greater proportion of patients. In
      particular, patients with resistant left-sided disease were shown to have a
      higher probability of achieving remission. Balsalazide was beneficial in patients
      with troublesome nocturnal symptoms. It has a similar efficacy in maintaining
      remission when compared to sulfasalazine and mesalazine. The advantage of
      balsalazide over other 5-aminosalicylic acid compounds is its superior patient
      tolerability with minimal side-effects.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of azathioprine in the maintenance of ciclosporin-induced
      remission of ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1307-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been shown that azathioprine prolongs the response to
      ciclosporin of steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis, but no specific data are
      available concerning its toxicity in this indication. AIM AND METHODS: The charts
      of 21 patients with steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis who received
      azathioprine overlapping with a successful ciclosporin course were reviewed for
      the onset of toxicity. The controls consisted of 48 initial responders to
      steroids who received azathioprine for steroid-dependence or resistance/toxicity.
      RESULTS: Two of the 21 patients were withdrawn because of hypersensitivity to
      azathioprine. The remaining 19 were treated for a median of 18 months together
      with a median daily steroid dose of 35 mg (10-75 mg) to be tapered off. Toxicity 
      (31%) included leukopenia alone (two cases), cholestasis alone (one case),
      cholestasis and increased amylase (one case), increased amylase alone (one case),
      and cutaneous infection (one case). The frequency of withdrawal was 21%. The mean
      daily steroid doses were reduced from 38 mg to 3.8 mg in the study cohort, and
      from 25 mg to 8 mg in the controls, among whom toxicity (27%) included four cases
      each of leukopenia and increased amylase, two cases each of alteration of liver
      enzymes and infection, and one case of gastric intolerance. Ten of the 48
      controls (20%) were withdrawn from the study. CONCLUSION: Azathioprine is as
      effective and safe in the maintenance of the response of patients with
      steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis to ciclosporin as it is in the treatment of
      those who respond to steroids.

TI  - Intravenous metronidazole for the treatment of Clostridium difficile colitis.
PG  - 1176-80
AB  - PURPOSE: Severe Clostridium difficile colitis may produce abdominal distention
      and ileus, precluding oral antibiotic therapy. Stimulated by several case reports
      in which intravenous metronidazole was used, we reviewed our experience. METHODS:
      Using pharmacy and microbiology laboratory records, we retrospectively identified
      patients with C. difficile colitis who received intravenous metronidazole as
      initial monotherapy. To be included, patients had to fulfill the following
      criteria: 1) at least six doses (equivalent to two days of therapy) of
      intravenous metronidazole were administered, 2) no other potential cause for
      colitis was found, and 3) the diagnosis of C. difficile colitis was firmly
      established. For eligible patients, five clinical parameters were assessed before
      and after intravenous metronidazole. RESULTS: Our patient group (n = 10) received
      an average of 13.7 (range, 6-24) doses of intravenous metronidazole as initial
      therapy for C. difficile colitis. All received a dose of 500 mg three times
      daily. The majority of patients with vomiting, fever, and/or abdominal pain
      present at the beginning of therapy had resolution with intravenous
      metronidazole. Only one patient developed a symptom (vomiting) while on therapy; 
      however, this eventually resolved when oral metronidazole was instituted. No
      patient required colectomy for refractory colitis or developed toxic megacolon.
      No patient, including those on prolonged courses, developed toxicity related to
      intravenous metronidazole such as peripheral neuropathy. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous
      metronidazole may be effective therapy in patients with C. difficile colitis. A
      randomized, prospective study appears warranted.

TI  - A prospective randomized controlled trial of intravenous ciprofloxacin as an
      adjunct to corticosteroids in acute, severe ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 971-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of antibiotics in the treatment of ulcerative colitis is
      controversial. This study aims at assessing the therapeutic role of ciprofloxacin
      as an adjunct to corticosteroids in acute severe ulcerative colitis. METHODS: In 
      this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 55
      consecutive patients fulfilling the criteria of Truelove and Witts for severe
      ulcerative colitis were randomized on admission to the hospital to receive
      intravenously ciprofloxacin (400 mg b.i.d.) (n = 29) or placebo (n = 27). All
      patients received parenteral nutrition, intravenous hydrocortisone (100 mg
      q.i.d.) and hydrocortisone enemas (100 mg b.i.d.). Patients were assessed after
      10 days of continuous treatment, or at any time a severe complication occurred.
      RESULTS: At study entry, there were no significant differences between treatment 
      groups in any patient or disease-related parameter. Twenty-three of 29 patients
      (79.3%) treated with ciprofloxacin and 20 of 26 patients (77%) treated with
      placebo showed substantial improvement and were given oral steroids (P > 0.1).
      Six patients in each group did not improve (n = 10) or developed complications (n
      = 2). Nine of these 12 patients underwent emergency colectomy; three patients
      consented to receive intravenous cyclosporin but did not achieve remission of
      colitis and they underwent elective colectomy. There were no perioperative or
      late deaths. CONCLUSIONS: A short course of intravenous ciprofloxacin does not
      seem to augment the effect of corticosteroids for patients with acute, severe
      ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Oligofructose and long-chain inulin: influence on the gut microbial ecology of
      rats associated with a human faecal flora.
PG  - 291-300
AB  - Dietary incorporation of fermentable, indigestible fructans may be of benefit to 
      gastrointestinal health by providing short-chain fatty acids, stimulating the
      proliferation of bifidobacteria or lactobacilli and suppressing potential
      pathogenic organisms in the gut. We tested the hypothesis that the effects of
      fructans on caecal, colonic and faecal short-chain fatty acid concentration and
      microflora composition depend on their chain length. Germ-free rats associated
      with a human faecal flora were randomly assigned to one of four treatments as
      follows: (1) commercial standard diet as a control (Con); (2) Con+50 g
      short-chain oligofructose/kg (OF); (3) C+50 g long-chain inulin/kg (lcIN); or (4)
      Con+50 g OF-lcIN/kg (Mix OF-lcIN). Changes in bacterial population groups in
      response to feeding these diets were investigated with 16S rRNA-targeted probes
      applied in in situ hybridization. Mix OF-lcIN- and lcIN-containing diets resulted
      in larger numbers of caecal, colonic and faecal bacteria of the Clostridium
      coccoides-Eubacterium rectale cluster than Con (10.6 and 10.3 v. 9.5 log10/g wet 
      wt), whereas OF alone did not affect this bacterial group in caecum, colon or
      faeces. A bifidogenic effect was only observed in the colon and faeces of
      OF-treated rats. More lactobacilli were found in caecal and colonic contents of
      Mix OF-lcIN-fed rats and in faeces of OF-fed rats compared with Con. Mix OF-lcIN 
      and OF led to significantly smaller numbers of caecal, colonic and faecal
      bacteria belonging to the Clostridium histolyticum and C. lituseburense groups
      than Con (6.8 and 6.9 v. 7.9 log10/g wet wt). Counts of total bacteria,
      Bacteroides-Prevotella and Enterobacteriaceae did not differ between the groups. 
      OF and/or lcIN-containing diets significantly increased the caecal and colonic
      concentration of butyrate and its relative molar proportion. Only lcIN-containing
      diets resulted in a higher faecal concentration of butyrate than Con. Higher
      molar proportions of faecal butyrate were observed with all diets that had been
      supplemented with OF and/or lcIN. Stimulation of butyrate production could be of 
      interest for the prevention of ulcerative colitis and colon cancer.

TI  - Pneumatosis intestinalis in non-neonatal pediatric patients.
PG  - 402-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe fully pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) in non-neonatal
      pediatric patients and to characterize those patients with higher risk of poor
      outcome, including need for surgery and death. METHODS: A retrospective chart
      review was conducted of all patients 30 days of age and older with PI in a
      tertiary care children's hospital during an 8-year period. Underlying medical
      condition, presenting signs and symptoms, radiologic grade of pneumatosis, and
      events that immediately preceded the onset of PI were reviewed, and their
      correlation with outcome was assessed. RESULTS: Thirty-seven episodes of PI
      occurred in 32 patients. Seventy-eight percent of patients were male, and the
      median age was 29 months. Major patient diagnostic groups identified with PI
      included healthy children (22%), patients with organ and bone marrow transplant
      (22%), patients with decompensated congenital heart disease (12.5%), motility
      disorders (12.5%), gastroschisis (9%), and short bowel syndrome (6%). The most
      common events that immediately preceded the onset of PI were noninfectious
      colitis (32%), acute enteric infection or toxin (27%), bowel ischemia (20%), and 
      gastrointestinal dysmotility (17%). Resolution of PI with medical management
      occurred in 78% of episodes (good outcome). Twenty-two percent of episodes
      resulted in a poor outcome: patient death (8%) or surgery (14%). The presence of 
      portal venous gas and low mean serum bicarbonate concentration were the only
      clinical factors that correlated significantly with poor outcome. Only 25% of
      patients with pneumoperitoneum required surgery. Poor outcome was seen most
      commonly in 2 patient diagnostic groups: transplant patients (43% of patients)
      and decompensated cardiac disease (50% of patients). The event that preceded PI
      also had an impact on outcome. PI preceded by ischemia or graft versus host
      disease colitis was associated with poor outcome in 50% and 75% of cases,
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: PI is a radiologic sign that occurs in a variety of
      settings in non-neonates. PI preceded by bowel ischemia or graft versus host
      disease colitis has the worst prognosis, and the presence of portal venous gas
      and acidosis correlate with poor outcome. Not all patients with pneumoperitoneum 
      require surgical intervention. Overall, outcome of PI in non-neonatal patients
      was better than that reported in neonates with necrotizing
      enterocolitis.pneumatosis intestinalis, necrotizing enterocolitis, non-neonatal.

TI  - Current diagnosis, management and morbidity in paediatric inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 400-5
AB  - UNLABELLED: In the 1970s several reports highlighted the long delay in diagnosis 
      often experienced by children with Crohn's disease. In recent years this disorder
      has attracted much publicity, and many believe that the incidence has increased
      substantially. The aim of this investigation was to determine whether heightened 
      awareness had shortened the interval to diagnosis, improved clinical management
      and reduced morbidity. A retrospective study was therefore carried out on 112
      children with inflammatory bowel disease (64 Crohn's disease, 41 ulcerative
      colitis, 7 indeterminate colitis) referred to a paediatric gastroenterology
      department in the UK between 1994 and 1998. In Crohn's disease the median
      interval to diagnosis was 47 wk (maximum 7 y). In those without diarrhoea this
      was longer (66 vs 28 wk; p = 0.005). In ulcerative colitis the median interval
      was 20 wk (maximum 3 y). Even in severe colitis the median interval was 5.5 wk
      (range 3-9 wk) and 4 required urgent colectomy soon after referral. Many with
      unrecognized Crohn's disease had undergone inappropriate treatments, such as
      growth hormone or psychiatric therapy. Nineteen (17%) had undergone endoscopic
      investigations in adult units prior to referral. Malnutrition was equally common 
      in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (11%). Short stature was present in 19%
      with Crohn's disease, and 5% with ulcerative colitis, and was severe in 8% with
      Crohn's disease. There was a significant correlation between symptom duration and
      the degree of growth impairment present (r(s) = -0.4; p = 0.004). CONCLUSION:
      This study suggests that late diagnosis and inappropriate investigation and
      management are still significant problems.
