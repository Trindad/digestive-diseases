TI  - Reduction of atherogenic risk in patients with type 2 diabetes by curcuminoid
      extract: a randomized controlled trial.

AB  - Curcumin is a phytocompound found in the root of turmeric, a common herbal
      ingredient in many Asian cuisines. The compound contains anti-inflammatory
      activity, which is mediated through an up-regulation of adiponectin and reduction
      of leptin. Consumption of curcumin was shown to prevent some deteriorative
      conditions caused by inflammation, such as ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid
      arthritis and esophagitis, and so on. Inflammation-associated cardiovascular
      conditions such as atherosclerosis are common in diabetes patients. The
      anti-inflammation effect of curcumin might be beneficial to prevent such
      condition in these patients. We aim to evaluate an antiatherosclerosis effect of 
      curcumin in diabetes patients. Effects of curcumin on risk factors for
      atherosclerosis were investigated in a 6-month randomized, double-blinded and
      placebo-controlled clinical trial that included subjects diagnosed with type 2
      diabetes. An atherosclerosis parameter, the pulse wave velocity, and other
      metabolic parameters in patients treated with placebo and curcumin were compared.
      Our results showed that curcumin intervention significantly reduced pulse wave
      velocity, increased level of serum adiponectin and decreased level of leptin.
      These results are associated with reduced levels of homeostasis model
      assessment-insulin resistance, triglyceride, uric acid, visceral fat and total
      body fat. In summary, a 6-month curcumin intervention in type 2 diabetic
      population lowered the atherogenic risks. In addition, the extract helped to
      improve relevant metabolic profiles in this high-risk population.

TI  - ErbB receptors and their growth factor ligands in pediatric intestinal
      inflammation.
PG  - 127-32
LID - 10.1038/pr.2013.210 [doi]
AB  - The ErbB tyrosine kinases (epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), ErbB2/HER2,
      ErbB3, and ErbB4) are cell surface growth factor receptors widely expressed in
      many developing mammalian tissues, including in the intestinal tract. Signaling
      elicited by these receptors promotes epithelial cell growth and survival, and
      ErbB ligands have been proposed as therapeutic agents for intestinal diseases of 
      pediatric populations, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), necrotizing
      enterocolitis (NEC), and inflammation associated with total parenteral nutrition 
      (TPN). Furthermore, emerging evidence points to reduced ErbB ligand expression
      and thus reduced ErbB activity in IBD, NEC, and TPN models. This review will
      discuss the current understanding of the role of ErbB receptors in the
      pathogenesis and potential treatment of pediatric intestinal inflammation, with
      focus on the altered signaling in disease and the molecular mechanisms by which
      exogenous ligands are protective.

PG  - 8571-9
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v19.i46.8571 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative
      colitis, not only affect the intestinal tract but also have an extraintestinal
      involvement within the oral cavity. These oral manifestations may assist in the
      diagnosis and the monitoring of disease activity, whilst ignoring them may lead
      to an inaccurate diagnosis and useless and expensive workups. Indurated tag-like 
      lesions, cobblestoning, and mucogingivitis are the most common specific oral
      findings encountered in CD cases. Aphthous stomatitis and pyostomatitis vegetans 
      are among non-specific oral manifestations of IBD. In differential diagnosis,
      side effects of drugs, infections, nutritional deficiencies, and other
      inflammatory conditions should also be considered. Treatment usually involves
      managing the underlying intestinal disease. In severe cases with local symptoms, 
      topical and/or systemic steroids and immunosuppressive drugs might be used.

TI  - High-throughput multi-analyte Luminex profiling implicates eotaxin-1 in
      ulcerative colitis.
PG  - e82300
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0082300 [doi]
AB  - Accurate and high-throughput technologies are needed for identification of new
      therapeutic targets and for optimizing therapy in inflammatory bowel disease. Our
      aim was to assess multi-analyte protein-based assays of cytokines/chemokines
      using Luminex technology. We have reported that Luminex-based profiling was
      useful in assessing response to L-arginine therapy in the mouse model of dextran 
      sulfate sodium colitis. Therefore, we studied prospectively collected samples
      from ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and control subjects. Serum, colon
      biopsies, and clinical information were obtained from subjects undergoing
      colonoscopy for evaluation of UC or for non-UC indications. In total, 38 normal
      controls and 137 UC cases completed the study. Histologic disease severity and
      the Mayo Disease Activity Index (DAI) were assessed. Serum and colonic tissue
      cytokine/chemokine profiles were measured by Luminex-based multiplex testing of
      42 analytes. Only eotaxin-1 and G-CSF were increased in serum of patients with
      histologically active UC vs. controls. While 13 cytokines/chemokines were
      increased in active UC vs. controls in tissues, only eotaxin-1 was increased in
      all levels of active disease in both serum and tissue. In tissues, eotaxin-1
      correlated with the DAI and with eosinophil counts. Increased eotaxin-1 levels
      were confirmed by real-time PCR. Tissue eotaxin-1 levels were also increased in
      experimental murine colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium, oxazolone, or
      Citrobacter rodentium, but not in murine Helicobacter pylori infection. Our data 
      implicate eotaxin-1 as an etiologic factor and therapeutic target in UC, and
      indicate that Luminex-based assays may be useful to assess IBD pathogenesis and
      to select patients for anti-cytokine/chemokine therapies.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) frequently manifests during
      childhood and adolescence. For providing and understanding a comprehensive
      picture of a patients' health status, health-related quality of life (HRQoL)
      instruments are an essential complement to clinical symptoms and functional
      limitations. Currently, the IMPACT-III questionnaire is one of the most
      frequently used disease-specific HRQoL instrument among patients with IBD.
      However, there is a lack of studies examining the validation and reliability of
      this instrument. METHODS: 146 paediatric IBD patients from the multicenter Swiss 
      IBD paediatric cohort study database were included in the study. Medical and
      laboratory data were extracted from the hospital records. HRQoL data were
      assessed by means of standardized questionnaires filled out by the patients in a 
      face-to-face interview. RESULTS: The original six IMPACT-III domain scales could 
      not be replicated in the current sample. A principal component analysis with the 
      extraction of four factor scores revealed the most robust solution. The four
      factors indicated good internal reliability (Cronbach's alpha=.64-.86), good
      concurrent validity measured by correlations with the generic KIDSCREEN-27 scales
      and excellent discriminant validity for the dimension of physical functioning
      measured by HRQoL differences for active and inactive severity groups (p<.001,
      d=1.04). CONCLUSIONS: This study with Swiss children with IBD indicates good
      validity and reliability for the IMPACT-III questionnaire. However, our findings 
      suggest a slightly different factor structure than originally proposed. The
      IMPACT-III questionnaire can be recommended for its use in clinical practice. The
      factor structure should be further examined in other samples.

TI  - Delving into disability in Crohn's disease: dysregulation of molecular pathways
      may explain skeletal muscle loss in Crohn's disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: In Crohn's disease (CD), skeletal muscle mass and function are
      reduced compared to healthy controls, potentially resulting in disability.
      Mechanisms contributing to muscle impairment, and thus potential therapeutic
      targets, are poorly understood. This study aimed to measure and compare skeletal 
      muscle size and molecular targets involved in skeletal muscle growth, in CD
      subjects and healthy controls. METHODS: CD (n=27) and healthy (n=22) subjects
      were recruited from the IBD outpatient clinic and via local advertisement
      respectively. Demographics and clinical data were collected via survey and
      interview. Quadriceps muscle cross-sectional area was measured using peripheral
      quantitative CT scanning. Levels of muscle hypertrophy and atrophy signalling
      targets using quantitative PCR and western blotting were measured in muscle
      biopsies. RESULTS: Muscle size was 14% lower (p=0.055) and a 54% lower
      phosphorylated:total (p:t) Akt ratio was measured in the muscle samples (p<0.05),
      indicating an attenuated muscle hypertrophy pathway in CD compared with controls.
      In those with CD, a lower p:t Akt ratio (<0.97) was associated with lower serum
      vitamin D3, lower physical activity indices (49 vs 64 mmol/L, 1.7 vs 2.2x10(6)
      accelerometer counts respectively, each p<0.05) and a trend towards lower serum
      ferritin levels (128 vs 322mg/L, p=0.07), compared with CD subjects with
      normal/high p:t Akt ratios. CONCLUSION: The reduced muscle mass in CD may be
      explained, in part, by impaired activation of muscle protein synthesis pathways, 
      notably the IGF1-Akt pathway. Normal vitamin D levels and regular exercise may be
      protective in CD against this trend, though confirmatory longitudinal studies are
      needed.

AB  - An association between multiple sclerosis (MS) and inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) has been suggested. The purpose of this study was to compare the disease
      course of patients with both MS and IBD with that of patients with isolated MS or
      isolated IBD. Sixty-six MS-IBD patients were identified and were matched with 251
      isolated MS and 257 isolated IBD controls. Main outcomes were scores using the
      Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) in MS and extent of disease extension in 
      IBD at last clinical evaluation. After a median 12 years of disease duration, the
      median EDSS and the percentages of patients reaching an EDSS of 3.0 and 4.0 were 
      significantly lower in MS-IBD patients than in controls. MS had no impact on IBD.
      MS course appears to be milder in patients with concomitant IBD.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Fatigue, weakness and musculoskeletal manifestations are
      associated with IBD. An impaired nutritional status and a reduced physical
      activity can contribute to these clinical outcomes, impacting quality of life and
      increasing disability. This study aims to assess muscle strength and lower limb
      physical performance in female UC patients, taking into consideration disease
      activity, body composition and habitual physical activity. METHODS: A
      case-control study was performed including 23 UC female outpatients and 23 age-
      and BMI-matched healthy women as controls. Quadriceps strength (QS), handgrip
      strength (HGS), physical performance based measures (five repetitions sit-up test
      and 4meter gait speed test), body composition (bioelectrical impedance analysis, 
      anthropometry), and habitual physical activity (HPA) levels were assessed.
      RESULTS: UC group had decreased QS (-6%; P=0.012), slower sit-up test (-32%;
      P=0.000), slower gait speed (-17% P=0.002) and decreased HPA level (-30%,
      P=0.001) compared with controls. No difference in HGS was observed between
      groups. Logistic regression showed that UC was an independent factor for
      decreased QS and slower sit-up test, while HPA was a protective factor for
      impaired gait speed. Multivariate linear regression showed that BMI was
      independently associated with an improved QS and slower sit-up test in the UC
      group. CONCLUSION: Women with UC had decreased lower limb strength and mobility
      limitations, which were associated with BMI and the level of physical activity.
      Early evaluation of nutritional status and performance of the lower limbs could
      identify UC patients with pre-clinical disability who may benefit from earlier
      health lifestyle modifications.

TI  - Polymorphisms in the sodium-dependent ascorbate transporter gene SLC23A1 are
      associated with susceptibility to Crohn disease.
PG  - 378-83

AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are 2 common
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) associated with intestinal inflammation and
      tissue damage. Oxidative stress is suggested to play a major role in the
      initiation and progression of IBD. Vitamin C (ascorbate, ascorbic acid)
      supplementation has reduced oxidative stress in persons with IBD. The role of
      ascorbate transporters in IBD remains to be determined. SLC23A1 is a major
      ascorbate transporter in the intestinal tract, and some of its genetic variants
      have been associated with severely decreased ascorbate transport and lower
      systemic concentrations. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether common 
      genetic variants in the vitamin C transporter SLC23A1 are associated with the
      risk of IBD. DESIGN: Genomic DNA samples from patients with CD (n = 162) and UC
      (n = 149) from the Manitoba IBD Cohort Study and ethnically matched controls (n =
      142) were genotyped for 3 SLC23A1 polymorphisms (rs6596473, rs33972313, and
      rs10063949) by using TaqMan assays. RESULTS: Variation at rs10063949 (G allele
      for heterozygote and homozygote) was associated with increased susceptibility to 
      CD (OR: 2.54; 95% CI: 1.38, 4.66; OR: 4.72; 95% CI: 2.53, 8.81; P < 0.0001;
      respectively). A strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) was observed across the
      SLC23A1 region (variation rs6596473 with rs10063949) for CD and UC (D' = 0.94 and
      0.96, respectively). The risk alleles confirmed a haplotype (CGG) that is carried
      more in CD patients (65.3%, P < 0.0001) than in controls (43.5%). CONCLUSIONS: A 
      genetic variant (rs10063949-G) in the SLC23A1 ascorbate transporter locus was
      identified and is associated with an increased risk of CD in a white Canadian IBD
      cohort. The presented evidence that SLC23A1 variations can modulate the risk of
      CD has implications for understanding ascorbate transport in CD patients and
      provides a novel opportunity toward individualized nutritional therapy for
      patients carrying the disease-associated genotype.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with its two distinct entities, Crohn's disease 
      and ulcerative colitis, and Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) are autoimmune
      diseases. The prevalence of these diseases continues to rapidly rise in the
      industrialized world. Despite the identification of several genetic loci that are
      associated with both IBD and T1D, thus far, there is a paucity of epidemiological
      data to support a clinical overlap. In an effort to better understand the
      underlying pathogenic mechanisms of both IBD and T1D, this review summarizes the 
      literature about these related autoimmune diseases, describes the most recent
      advances in their etiopathogenesis and emphasizes the genetic and nongenetic
      factors that exercise a differential influence. Genome-wide association studies
      have identified genetic loci with a role in immune response regulation that are
      linked to both IBD (particularly Crohn's disease) and T1D. Some of these genetic 
      loci (e.g., IL-18RAP) have a divergent role, conferring risk for one disease and 
      protection for the other. Recent evidence highlights an important role of gut
      microbiota and cellular responses (e.g., endoplasmic reticulum stress) in the
      pathogenesis of both IBD and T1D.

TI  - Dietary iron does not impact the quality of life of patients with quiescent
      ulcerative colitis: an observational study.
PG  - 152
LID - 10.1186/1475-2891-12-152 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In animal models, excess luminal iron exacerbates colonic
      inflammation and cancer development. Moreover, in inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) patients with mild to moderate disease activity dietary fortificant iron
      intake is inversely related to quality of life. Here we sought to determine
      whether dietary iron intakes were also related to quality of life in IBD patients
      in remission. METHODS: Forty eight patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), 42 of
      which had quiescent disease during this observational study, and 53 healthy
      control subjects completed quality of life questionnaires and 7-day food diaries.
      For comparative analysis, 34/group were matched and the linear relationship
      between dietary iron intakes (total, haem, non-haem or fortificant) and EuroQol
      quality of life measures was investigated. For UC patients the linear
      relationship between dietary iron intakes and the scores from the disease
      specific inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ) was also considered.
      RESULTS: The intake of dietary iron, and its various sub-fractions, were not
      associated with quality of life (EuroQol) in patients with quiescent disease or
      in healthy control subjects. The picture was similar for the 42 quiescent UC
      patients when disease-specific IBDQ was used. However, the 6 patients who
      relapsed during the study again showed an inverse association between IBDQ and
      dietary iron intake (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that dietary iron
      does not impact on quality of life in quiescent UC patients but support that,
      once the disease is triggered, luminal iron may be a permissive factor for
      exacerbation of disease activity resulting in lower quality of life.

AB  - The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is rapidly increasing in developing
      countries, especially among populations that are adopting Western-style diets.
      Several, but not all, epidemiological and experimental studies suggest that a
      high intake of meat, especially red and processed meat, is associated with
      increased CRC risk. Potential reasons for the association between high red and
      processed meat intake and CRC risk include the content of the meat (e.g. protein,
      heme) and compounds generated by the cooking process (e.g. N-nitroso compounds,
      heterocyclic amines). These factors can affect the large intestine mucosa with
      genotoxicity and metabolic disturbances. Increased bacterial fermentation
      (putrefaction) of undigested protein and production of bacterial metabolites
      derived from amino acids may affect colon epithelial homeostasis and renewal.
      This correlates with the fact that most colonic cancers are detected in the
      distal colon and rectum where protein fermentation actively occurs. However,
      there are still large controversies on the relationship between red meat
      consumption and CRC risk. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to enhance the
      current understanding on the association between high red and processed meat
      intakes with CRC risk. A principal focus of this review will be to discuss the
      meat-related components, such as proteins in the meat, heme, N-nitroso compounds,
      and heterocyclic amines, and the effects they have upon the large intestine
      mucosa and the intestinal gut microbiota.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Telephone communication is common between healthcare providers
      and patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We analyzed telephone
      activity at an IBD care center to identify disease and patient characteristics
      associated with high levels of telephone activity and determine if call volume
      could identify individuals at risk for future visits to the emergency department 
      (ED) or hospitalization. METHODS: We performed a prospective observational study 
      in which we categorized telephone calls received by nursing staff over 2 years at
      a tertiary care IBD clinic (2475 patients in 2009 and 3118 in 2010). We analyzed 
      data on 21,979 ingoing and outgoing calls in 2009 and 32,667 calls in 2010 and
      assessed associations between clinical factors and logged telephone encounters,
      and between patterns of telephone encounters and future visits to the ED or
      hospitalization. RESULTS: Telephone encounters occurred twice as frequently as
      office visits; 15% of the patients generated >10 telephone encounters per year
      and were responsible for half of all telephone encounters. A higher percentage of
      these high telephone encounter (HTE) patients were female, had Crohn's disease,
      received steroid treatment, had increased levels of C-reactive protein and rates 
      of erythrocyte sedimentation, had psychiatric comorbidities, and had chronic
      abdominal pain than patients with lower telephone encounters. The HTE patients
      were also more frequently seen in the ED or hospitalized over the same time
      period and in subsequent years. Forty-two percent of patients with >8 telephone
      encounters within 30 days were seen in the ED or hospitalized within the
      subsequent 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Based on an analysis of telephone records at
      an IBD clinic, 15% of patients account for half of all calls. These HTE patients 
      are a heterogeneous group with refractory disease who are likely to visit the ED 
      or be hospitalized.

AB  - As we enter into the era of 'personalized medicine', many of the recommendations 
      of 'evidence-based medicine' require scrutiny and adaptation to optimize
      individual outcomes. Several examples of these discrepancies are exemplified by
      the topics of aminosalicylate use in Crohn's disease, early use of biologic
      agents that target TNF and the role of calcineurin inhibitors versus anti-TNF
      agents in steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Guanylate cyclase C deficiency causes severe inflammation in a murine model of
      spontaneous colitis.
PG  - e79180
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0079180 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Guanylate Cyclase C (GC-C; Gucy2c) is a transmembrane receptor
      expressed in intestinal epithelial cells. Activation of GC-C by its secreted
      ligand guanylin stimulates intestinal fluid secretion. Familial mutations in GC-C
      cause chronic diarrheal disease or constipation and are associated with
      intestinal inflammation and infection. Here, we investigated the impact of GC-C
      activity on mucosal immune responses. METHODS: We utilized intraperitoneal
      injection of lipopolysaccharide to elicit a systemic cytokine challenge and then 
      measured pro-inflammatory gene expression in colonic mucosa. GC-C(+/+) and
      GC-C(-/-) mice were bred with interleukin (IL)-10 deficient animals and colonic
      inflammation were assessed. Immune cell influx and cytokine/chemokine expression 
      was measured in the colon of wildtype, IL-10(-/-), GC-C(+/+)IL-10(-/-) and
      GC-C(-/-)IL-10(-/-) mice. GC-C and guanylin production were examined in the colon
      of these animals and in a cytokine-treated colon epithelial cell line. RESULTS:
      Relative to GC-C(+/+) animals, intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide injection into 
      GC-C(-/-) mice increased proinflammatory gene expression in both whole colon
      tissue and in partially purified colonocyte isolations. Spontaneous colitis in
      GC-C(-/-)IL-10(-/-) animals was significantly more severe relative to
      GC-C(+/+)IL-10(-/-) mice. Unlike GC-C(+/+)IL-10(-/-) controls, colon pathology in
      GC-C(-/-)IL-10(-/-) animals was apparent at an early age and was characterized by
      severely altered mucosal architecture, crypt abscesses, and hyperplastic
      subepithelial lesions. F4/80 and myeloperoxidase positive cells as well as
      proinflammatory gene expression were elevated in GC-C(-/-)IL-10(-/-) mucosa
      relative to control animals. Guanylin was diminished early in colitis in vivo and
      tumor necrosis factor alpha suppressed guanylin mRNA and protein in intestinal
      goblet cell-like HT29-18-N2 cells. CONCLUSIONS: The GC-C signaling pathway blunts
      colonic mucosal inflammation that is initiated by systemic cytokine burst or loss
      of mucosal immune cell immunosuppression. These data as well as the apparent
      intestinal inflammation in human GC-C mutant kindred underscore the importance of
      GC-C in regulating the response to injury and inflammation within the gut.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) starting during childhood has been
      assumed to impair quality of life (QoL) of affected children. As this aspect is
      crucial for further personality development, the health-related quality of life
      (HRQOL) was assessed in a Swiss nationwide cohort to obtain detailed information 
      on the fields of impairment. METHODS: Data were prospectively acquired from
      pediatric patients included in the Swiss IBD Cohort Study. IBD activity was
      evaluated by PCDAI and PUCAI. The age adapted KIDSCREEN questionnaire was
      evaluated for 110 children with IBD (64 with Crohn's disease 46 with ulcerative
      colitis). Data were analyzed with respect to established reference values of
      healthy controls. RESULTS: In the KIDSCREEN index a moderate impairment was only 
      found for physical wellbeing due to disease activity. In contrast, mental
      well-being and social support were even better as compared to control values. A
      subgroup analysis revealed that this observation was restricted to the children
      in the German speaking part of Switzerland, whereas there was no difference
      compared to controls in the French part of Switzerland. Furthermore, autonomy and
      school variables were significantly higher in the IBD patients as compared to
      controls. CONCLUSIONS: The social support for children with IBD is excellent in
      this cohort. Only physical well-being was impaired due to disease activity,
      whereas all other KIDSCREEN parameters were better as compared to controls. This 
      indicates that effective coping and support strategies may be able to compensate 
      the burden of disease in pediatric IBD patients.

      management of pediatric ulcerative colitis.

AB  - An expert panel of the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) and
      European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition
      (ESPGHAN) initiated a consensus process to produce the first pediatric specific
      ulcerative colitis (UC) guidelines based on a systematic literature review.
      Treatment strategies must reflect that pediatric-onset UC has a slightly
      different phenotype than adult-onset disease with more often extensive
      (pancolitis) and more aggressive disease course. Other pediatric-specific aspects
      include growth, puberty, bone density accrual and emotional development and body 
      image acquisition. These differences and others influenced the development of
      pediatric treatment algorithms. It is recommended that virtually all children
      with UC must be treated with some maintenance therapy and 5-ASA requirement and
      dosing are often higher in children. A larger number of children are at risk for 
      steroid-dependency, and this should not be tolerated; steroid sparing strategies 
      with early use of immunosuppressors are recommended in high-risk patients. On the
      other hand, the safety profile of immunosuppressive therapy in children includes 
      the rare forms of lymphomas and many future treatment years. Colectomy and pouch 
      formation should be balanced in the treatment algorithms against the higher rate 
      of future infertility in girls. The acute and on-going management of pediatric UC
      should be guided by evidence- and consensus-based balanced decisions, reflecting 
      a vision of long-term treatment goals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coping is an integral part of adjustment for patients with
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease but has not been well described in the literature.
      This study explored the relationship between coping, perceived health competence,
      patient preference for involvement in their treatment, depression and quality of 
      life, particularly among patients with inactive disease (in remission). METHODS: 
      Subjects (n=70) with active and inactive IBD completed questionnaires, including 
      the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire, Beck Depression
      Inventory, Perceived Health Competence Scale and the Coping Inventory for
      Stressful Situations. The Harvey Bradshaw Index measured disease activity.
      RESULTS: Patients with inactive IBD demonstrated significantly more interest in
      participating in their treatment (p<.05), more perceived health competence
      (p=.001), less depressive symptoms (p<.001), more task oriented coping (p=.02),
      and better quality of life than those with active disease. Only Task Oriented
      Coping was significantly negatively associated with the number of flares among
      inactive patients (p<.001). Patient preference for participation in treatment was
      inversely associated with Avoidance (p=.005), Distraction (p=.008), and Social
      Diversion (p=.008) coping among inactive patients. CONCLUSION: Among patients in 
      remission, those who expressed a greater interest in treatment participation were
      also less likely to practice maladaptive coping. Our data demonstrate that a more
      active coping style may be associated with improved health outcome. Compared to
      patients with active disease, patients in remission are more likely to employ
      task oriented coping, demonstrate a higher interest in treatment participation,
      report greater perceived control of their health, and exhibit less depression
      symptoms. Our findings may increase awareness of the importance of identifying
      coping strategies for IBD patients, including those in remission.

TI  - Dynamics of vitamin D in patients with mild or inactive inflammatory bowel
      disease and their families.
PG  - 145

AB  - BACKGROUND: 25(OH) vitamin D levels may be low in patients with moderately or
      severely active inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD: Crohn's disease and Idiopathic 
      Ulcerative Colitis) but this is less clear in patients with mild or inactive IBD.
      Furthermore there is limited information of any family influence on 25(OH)
      vitamin D levels in IBD. As a possible risk factor we hypothesize that vitamin D 
      levels may also be low in families of IBD patients. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate
      25[OH] vitamin D levels in patients with IBD in remission or with mild activity. 
      A second objective is to evaluate whether there are relationships within IBD
      family units of 25[OH] vitamin D and what are the influences associated with
      these levels. METHODS: Participants underwent medical history, physical
      examination and a 114 item diet questionnaire. Serum 25[OH] vitamin D was
      measured, using a radioimmunoassay kit, (replete >/= 75, insufficient 50-74,
      deficient < 25-50, or severely deficient < 25 nmol/L). Associations between
      25[OH] vitamin D and twenty variables were evaluated using univariate regression.
      Multivariable analysis was also applied and intrafamilial dynamics were assessed.
      RESULTS: 55 patients and 48 controls with their respective families participated 
      (N206). 25[OH] vitamin D levels between patients and controls were similar (71.2 
      +/- 32.8 vs. 68.3 +/-26.2 nmol/L). Vitamin D supplements significantly increased 
      intake but correlation with serum 25[OH] vitamin D was significant only during
      non sunny months among patients. Within family units, patients' families had mean
      replete levels (82.3 +/- 34.2 nmol/L) and a modest correlation emerged during
      sunny months between patients and family (r2 =0.209 p = 0.032). These
      relationships were less robust and non significant in controls and their
      families. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with mild or inactive IBD 25[OH] vitamin D
      levels are less than ideal but are similar to controls. Taken together
      collectively, the results of this study suggest that patient family dynamics may 
      be different in IBD units from that in control family units. However contrary to 
      the hypothesis, intra familial vitamin D dynamics do not pose additional risks
      for development of IBD.

TI  - Altered colonic mucosal Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid (PUFA) derived lipid mediators
      in ulcerative colitis: new insight into relationship with disease activity and
      pathophysiology.
PG  - e76532
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0076532 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a relapsing inflammatory disorder of
      unconfirmed aetiology, variable severity and clinical course, characterised by
      progressive histological inflammation and with elevation of eicosanoids which
      have a known pathophysiological role in inflammation. Therapeutic interventions
      targetting eicosanoids (5-aminosalicylates (ASA)) are effective first line and
      adjunctive treatments in mild-moderate UC for achieving and sustaining clinical
      remission. However, the variable clinical response to 5-ASA and frequent
      deterioration in response to cyclo-oxygenase (COX) inhibitors, has prompted an in
      depth simultaneous evaluation of multiple lipid mediators (including eicosanoids)
      within the inflammatory milieu in UC. We hypothesised that severity of
      inflammation is associated with alteration of lipid mediators, in relapsing UC.
      DESIGN: Study was case-control design. Mucosal lipid mediators were determined by
      LC-MS/MS lipidomics analysis on mucosal biopsies taken from patients attending
      outpatients with relapsing UC. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses
      were used to investigate the association of mucosal lipid mediators, with the
      disease state and severity graded histologically. RESULTS: Levels of PGE2, PGD2, 
      TXB2, 5-HETE, 11-HETE, 12-HETE and 15-HETE are significantly elevated in inflamed
      mucosa and correlate with severity of inflammation, determined using validated
      histological scoring systems. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach of capturing inflammatory
      mediator signature at different stages of UC by combining comprehensive
      lipidomics analysis and computational modelling could be used to classify and
      predict mild-moderate inflammation; however, predictive index is diminished in
      severe inflammation. This new technical approach could be developed to tailor
      drug treatments to patients with active UC, based on the mucosal lipid mediator
      profile.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of infliximab in children with moderate-to-severe ulcerative
      colitis: results from a randomized, multicenter, open-label, phase 3 study.
PG  - 2753-62

AB  - BACKGROUND: To assess infliximab pharmacokinetics in pediatric ulcerative colitis
      (UC). METHODS: This phase 3, randomized, open-label multicenter study enrolled 60
      children (6-17 yr) with moderate-to-severely active UC (Mayo score, 6-12;
      endoscopic subscore, >/=2), despite conventional therapy. Patients received
      infliximab 5-mg/kg induction infusions at weeks 0, 2, and 6. Week 8 clinical
      responders (n = 45) were randomized to infliximab 5 mg/kg given every 8 weeks
      (q8w) through week 46 or every 12 weeks (q12w) through week 42. Patients losing
      response during maintenance infliximab were eligible to increase the dose (5-->10
      mg/kg) and/or shorten the dosing interval (q12w-->q8w). Blood samples were
      collected for infliximab concentration and pharmacokinetic determinations.
      RESULTS: Infliximab pharmacokinetics were not influenced by age (6-11 yr versus
      12-17 yr), baseline immunomodulator use, or the extent of UC. At week 8, higher
      serum infliximab concentrations (>/=41.1 mug/mL) were associated with greater
      proportions of patients achieving efficacy endpoints (clinical response, 92.9%;
      mucosal healing, 92.9%; and clinical remission, 64.3%) versus those with lower
      serum concentrations (<18.1 mug/mL; 53.9%, 53.9%, and 30.8%, respectively). At
      week 30, higher median trough serum infliximab concentrations were observed with 
      infliximab 5 mg/kg q8w (1.9 mug/mL) versus q12w (0.8 mug/mL) and with infliximab 
      10 mg/kg (2.9 mug/mL) versus 5 mg/kg (1.1 mug/mL) among patients who are regimen 
      adjusted. CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab pharmacokinetics/exposure-response relationship
      in patients with UC aged 6 to 17 years were generally comparable with those
      observed in reference adult UC populations, supporting using infliximab 5 mg/kg
      at weeks 0, 2, and 6 followed by maintenance dosing with 5 mg/kg q8w in these
      patients. A positive relationship was noted between serum infliximab level and
      clinical effect following induction therapy similar to adults.

AB  - Recommendations to consume fish for prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD),
      along with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved generally recognized as
      safe (GRAS) status for long chain omega-3 fatty acids, may have had the
      unanticipated consequence of encouraging long-chain omega-3 (omega-3) fatty acid 
      [(eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)] supplementation and
      fortification practices. While there is evidence supporting a protective role for
      EPA/DHA supplementation in reducing sudden cardiac events, the safety and
      efficacy of supplementation with LComega-3PUFA in the context of other disease
      outcomes is unclear. Recent studies of bacterial, viral, and fungal infections in
      animal models of infectious disease demonstrate that LComega-3PUFA intake dampens
      immunity and alters pathogen clearance and can result in reduced survival. The
      same physiological properties of EPA/DHA that are responsible for the
      amelioration of inflammation associated with chronic cardiovascular pathology or 
      autoimmune states, may impair pathogen clearance during acute infections by
      decreasing host resistance or interfere with tumor surveillance resulting in
      adverse health outcomes. Recent observations that high serum LComega-3PUFA levels
      are associated with higher risk of prostate cancer and atrial fibrillation raise 
      concern for adverse outcomes. Given the widespread use of supplements and
      fortification of common food items with LComega-3PUFA, this review focuses on the
      immunomodulatory effects of the dietary LComega-3PUFAs, EPA and DHA, the
      mechanistic basis for potential negative health outcomes, and calls for biomarker
      development and validation as rational first steps towards setting recommended
      dietary intake levels.

AB  - Surgery for inflammatory bowel disease under immunosuppressant drugs is a widely 
      discussed topic. Because therapeutic concepts have significantly changed, almost 
      no patient is currently without an immunosuppressant or biologic agent prior to
      surgery. However, the data whether biological agents and immunosuppressant are a 
      risk factor are very inconsistent. Concerning Crohn's disease, monotherapy with
      immunosuppressants or biological agents seems to have no negative influence on
      the postoperative results. In contrast, however, for ulcerative colitis more
      publications recognise biologic agents and immunosuppressants as a single therapy
      as a risk factor for infections. To reduce the general risk, all risk factors
      have to be reduced. In Crohn's disease, nutritional status must be optimised,
      corticoids should be reduced, biological agents and immunosuppressant drugs
      should be stopped, protection of an eventual anastomosis by a stoma. For
      ulcerative colitis in high-risk patients, a three-stage restaurative
      proctocolectomy is favoured to a one- or two-staged proctocolectomy.

AB  - AIM: To investigate the diet of pouch patients compared to healthy controls, and 
      to correlate pouch patients' diet with disease behavior. METHODS: Pouch patients 
      were recruited and prospectively followed-up at the Comprehensive Pouch Clinic at
      the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center. Pouch behavior was determined based on
      clinical, endoscopic and histological criteria. Healthy age- and sex-matched
      volunteers were selected from the "MABAT" Israeli Nutrition and Public Health
      Governmental Study and served as the control group. All the participants
      completed a 106-item food frequency questionnaire categorized into food groups
      and nutritional values based on those used in the United States Department of
      Agriculture food pyramid and the Israeli food pyramid. Data on Dietary behavior, 
      food avoidance, the use of nutritional supplements, physical activity, smoking
      habits, and body-mass index (BMI) were also obtained. Pouch patients who had
      familial adenomatous polyposis (n = 3), irritable pouch syndrome (n = 4), or
      patients whose pouch surgery took place less than one year previously (n = 5)
      were excluded from analysis. RESULTS: The pouch patients (n = 80) consumed
      significantly more from the bakery products food group (1.2 +/- 1.4 servings/d vs
      0.6 +/- 1.1 servings/d, P < 0.05) and as twice as many servings from the oils and
      fats (4.8 +/- 3.4 servings/d vs 2.4 +/- 2 servings/d, P < 0.05), and the nuts and
      seeds food group (0.3 +/- 0.6 servings/d vs 0.1 +/- 0.4 servings/d, P < 0.05)
      compared to the controls (n = 80). The pouch patients consumed significantly more
      total fat (97.6 +/- 40.5 g/d vs 84.4 +/- 39 g/d, P < 0.05) and fat components
      [monounsaturated fatty acids (38.4 +/- 16.4 g/d vs 30 +/- 14 g/d, P < 0.001), and
      saturated fatty acids (30 +/- 15.5 g/d vs 28 +/- 14.1 g/d, P < 0.00)] than the
      controls. In contrast, the pouch patients consumed significantly fewer
      carbohydrates (305.5 +/- 141.4 g/d vs 369 +/- 215.2 g/d, P = 0.03), sugars (124
      +/- 76.2 g/d vs 157.5 +/- 90.4 g/d, P = 0.01), theobromine (77.8 +/- 100 mg/d vs 
      236.6 +/- 244.5 mg/d, P < 0.00), retinol (474.4 +/- 337.1 mug/d vs 832.4 +/-
      609.6 mug/d, P < 0.001) and dietary fibers (26.2 +/- 15.4 g/d vs 30.7 +/- 14 g/d,
      P = 0.05) than the controls. Comparisons of the food consumption of the patients 
      without (n = 23) and with pouchitis (n = 45) showed that the former consumed
      twice as many fruit servings as the latter (3.6 +/- 4.1 servings/d vs 1.8 +/- 1.7
      servings/d, respectively, P < 0.05). In addition, the pouchitis patients consumed
      significantly fewer liposoluble antioxidants, such as cryptoxanthin (399 +/- 485 
      mug/d vs 890.1 +/- 1296.8 mug/d, P < 0.05) and lycopene (6533.1 +/- 6065.7 mug/d 
      vs 10725.7 +/- 10065.9 mug/d, P < 0.05), and less vitamin A (893.3 +/- 516 mug/d 
      vs 1237.5 +/- 728 mug/d, P < 0.05) and vitamin C (153.3 +/- 130 mg/d vs 285.3 +/-
      326.3 mg/d, P < 0.05) than the patients without pouchitis. The mean BMI of the
      pouchitis patients was significantly lower than the BMI of the patients with a
      normal pouch: 22.6 +/- 3.2 vs 27 +/- 4.9 (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Decreased
      consumption of antioxidants by patients with pouchitis may expose them to the
      effects of inflammatory and oxidative stress and contribute to the development of
      pouchitis.

      improve outcomes.
PG  - 6367-74
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v19.i38.6367 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, pediatric health care has embraced the concept of quality
      improvement to improve patient outcomes. As quality improvement efforts are
      implemented, network collaboration (where multiple centers and practices
      implement standardized programs) is a popular option. In a collaborative network,
      improvement in the conduct of structural, process and outcome quality measures
      can lead to improvements in overall health, and benchmarks can be used to assess 
      and compare progress. In this review article, we provided an overview of the
      quality improvement movement and the role of quality indicators in this movement.
      We reviewed current quality improvement efforts in pediatric inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD), as well as other pediatric chronic illnesses. We discussed the
      need to standardize the development of quality indicators used in quality
      improvement networks to assess medical care, and the validation techniques which 
      can be used to ensure that process indicators result in improved outcomes of
      clinical significance. We aimed to assess current quality improvement efforts in 
      pediatric IBD and other diseases, such as childhood asthma, childhood arthritis, 
      and neonatal health. By doing so, we hope to learn from their successes and
      failures and to move the field forward for future improvements in the care
      provided to children with IBD.

TI  - Pathological fractures in paediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 141-51
LID - 10.1007/s00431-013-2174-5 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Paediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially Crohn's
      disease (CD), is commonly associated with poor skeletal health, related to the
      direct effects of chronic inflammation, prolonged use of glucocorticoid (GC),
      poor nutrition, delayed puberty and low muscle mass. Low bone mineral density is 
      commonly reported, although the prevalence of long bone fractures may not be
      increased in these patients. Emerging evidence however suggests that there may be
      an increased risk of vertebral fractures (VFs) in this group. VFs presenting at
      diagnosis of paediatric CD, prior to any GC exposure, have been reported,
      highlighting the deleterious effect of inflammation on skeletal health. This
      paper reviews the published literature on pathophysiology of skeletal morbidity
      and fractures in paediatric IBD, illustrated with a new case report of multiple
      VFs in a prepubertal girl with CD, soon after diagnosis, who received minimal
      amounts of oral GC. Optimising control of disease, addressing vitamin D
      deficiency, encouraging physical activity and ensuring normal growth and pubertal
      progression are paramount to management of bone health in these patients. Despite
      the lack of evidence, there may be a place for bisphosphonate treatment,
      especially in the presence of symptomatic pathological fractures, but this
      requires close monitoring by clinicians with expertise in paediatric bone health.
      CONCLUSION: Chronic inflammation mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines may have 
      adverse effects on skeletal health in paediatric patients with IBD. The risk of
      vertebral fractures may be increased, even without exposure to glucocorticoid.
      Clinical monitoring of these patients requires careful attention to the various
      factors that impact on bone health.

      disease.
PG  - 1882-8
LID - 10.1097/PAS.0b013e31829f03ee [doi]
AB  - Although the significance of focally enhanced gastritis (FEG) as a marker of
      Crohn disease (CD) in adults has been contested, several studies suggest that it 
      may be more specific of CD in pediatric patients. This study describes the
      detailed histologic features of FEG in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      and clarifies its association with CD. A series of 119 consecutive newly
      diagnosed IBD patients (62 CD cases, 57 ulcerative colitis [UC] cases) with upper
      and lower gastrointestinal biopsies were evaluated. The histology of the gastric 
      biopsies was reviewed blinded to final diagnoses and compared with age-matched
      healthy controls (n=66). FEG was present in 43% of IBD patients (CD 55% vs. UC
      30%, P=0.0092) and in 5% of controls. Among CD patients, FEG was more common in
      younger patients (73% in children aged 10 y and below, 43% in children above 10 y
      of age, P=0.0358), with the peak in the 5- to 10-year age group (80%). The total 
      number of glands involved in each FEG focus was higher in UC (6.4+/-5.1 glands)
      than in CD (4.0+/-3.0 glands, P=0.0409). Amongst the CD cohort, patients with FEG
      were more likely than those without FEG to have active ileitis (79% vs. 40%,
      P=0.0128) and granulomas elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract (82% vs. 43%,
      P=0.0016). There was no correlation between FEG and other gastrointestinal
      findings of UC. We demonstrate that differences in FEG seen in pediatric CD and
      UC relate to not only their frequencies but also the morphology and relationship 
      with other gastrointestinal lesions. Further, FEG is associated with disease
      activity and the presence of granulomas in pediatric CD.

TI  - Review article: the association of diet with onset and relapse in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1172-87
LID - 10.1111/apt.12501 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of diet in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is supported by 
      migration studies and increasing incidences in line with Westernisation. AIM: To 
      give a complete overview of studies associating habitual diet with the onset or
      relapses in ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: A
      structured search in Pubmed, the Cochrane Library and EMBASE was performed using 
      defined key words, including only full text papers in English language. RESULTS: 
      Forty-one studies were identified, investigating onset (n = 35), relapses (n = 5)
      or both (n = 1). Several studies reported high intake of sugar or
      sugar-containing foods (n = 7 UC, n = 12 CD), and low intake of fruits and/or
      vegetables (n = 5 UC, n = 10 CD) to be associated with an increased onset risk.
      However, these findings could not be confirmed by similar or higher numbers of
      other studies. A possible protective role was found for grain-derived products in
      CD onset, but results were inconsistent for dietary fibre in UC and CD and
      grain-derived products in UC. No definite conclusions could be drawn for
      unsaturated fatty acids (UFA), protein and energy intake due to limited and/or
      inconsistent results. Six studies reported on diet and relapse risk, of which
      only two (n = 1 UC, n = 1 CD) had a prospective follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The
      current evidence is not sufficient to draw firm conclusions on the role of
      specific food components or nutrients in the aetiology of IBD. Furthermore, large
      prospective studies into the role of habitual diet as a trigger of relapses are
      needed, to identify new therapeutic or preventive targets.

TI  - 6-Thioguanine levels in pediatric IBD patients: adherence is more important than 
      dose.
PG  - 2652-8
LID - 10.1097/01.MIB.0000436960.00405.56 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thiopurine immunosuppressants such as 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) are
      widely used to maintain remission in children with both Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis. Therapeutic efficacy is associated with higher red blood cell
      levels of the thiopurine metabolite 6-thioguanine (6-TGN). Studies in both
      children and adults have inexplicably failed to demonstrate a significant
      correlation between prescribed dose and level of 6-TGN. We aimed to quantify the 
      relationship between 6-TGN levels and adherence. METHODS: We used electronic
      monitoring devices to assess adherence in children and adolescents with
      inflammatory bowel diseases who were prescribed 6-MP. RESULTS: During 3230 days
      of monitoring in 19 subjects, adherence to 6-MP was 74.2%. Due to the generally
      low adherence to the prescribed dose of 6-MP, the 6-TGN level was not correlated 
      with the prescribed dose. The 6-TGN level was significantly correlated with the
      adherence-adjusted dose (R(2) = 0.395). It was also significantly correlated to
      adherence alone (R(2) = 0.478). Adherence to 5-aminosalicylic acid and 6-MP were 
      significantly positively correlated (r(s)(9) = 0.82, P = 0.00), and a significant
      relationship was found between 5-aminosalicylic acid adherence and 6-TGN levels
      independent of 6-MP adherence. Furthermore, low adherence to 6-MP was associated 
      with increased likelihood of escalation of medical therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Red
      blood cell 6-TGN levels are strongly correlated with the dose, when the dose is
      actually taken. Lack of efficacy of thiopurines may often be the result of poor
      adherence. Novel ways of assessing and improving adherence are necessary. Future 
      trials should assess adherence in study participants. Intake of 5-aminosalicylic 
      acid positively influences 6-TGN levels.

TI  - Review article: evidence-based dietary advice for patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease.
PG  - 1156-71
LID - 10.1111/apt.12500 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The therapeutic effect of enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease (CD)
      and the epidemiological associations between diet and inflammatory bowel disease 
      (IBD) implicate diet in IBD causation. There is little evidence, however, to
      support specific dietary changes and patients often receive contradictory advice.
      AIM: To review the literature on the impacts of diet on IBD causation and
      activity to produce guidance based on 'best available evidence'. METHOD: Review
      of Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases from 1975 to 2012 using MeSH headings
      'crohn's disease' 'ulcerative colitis' 'enteral' 'diet' 'nutrition' 'fatty acid' 
      and 'food additives'. RESULTS: Enteral nutrition with a formula-defined feed is
      effective treatment for CD, but approximately 50% of patients relapse within 6
      months of return to normal diet. There is no direct evidence of benefit from any 
      other specific dietary modification in CD, but indirect evidence supports
      recommendation of a low intake of animal fat, insoluble fibre and processed fatty
      foods containing emulsifiers. Foods tolerated in sustained remission may not be
      tolerated following relapse. Some evidence supports vitamin D supplementation. In
      ulcerative colitis (UC), evidence is weaker, but high intakes of meat and
      margarine correlate with increased UC incidence and high meat intake also
      correlates with increased likelihood of relapse. CONCLUSIONS: There is little
      evidence from interventional studies to support specific dietary recommendations.
      Nevertheless, people with IBD deserve advice based on 'best available evidence'
      rather than no advice at all, although dietary intake should not be
      inappropriately restrictive. Further interventional studies of dietary
      manipulation are urgently required.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Clostridium difficile is the major cause of
      antibiotic-associated diarrhea and is the most well known bacterial pathogen
      associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Enterotoxigenic Clostridium
      perfringens has also been detected in up to 15% of antibiotic-associated diarrhea
      cases, and it has not been found in healthy people. The aim of this study was to 
      investigate the prevalence of C. perfringens infection in pediatric patients with
      IBD. METHODS: This was a prospective, controlled study evaluating pediatric IBD
      patients in the Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition in Warsaw,
      Poland. All of the patients were diagnosed according to the Porto criteria. There
      were two control groups: (1) non-IBD patients that were suspected for bacterial
      diarrhea and (2) healthy children. Stool samples were collected on the day of
      admission. C. perfringens infection diagnosis was based on a positive stool
      enzyme immunoassay (C. perfringens enterotoxin test kit TechLab). RESULTS: 91
      fecal specimens from patients with IBD were collected. The average patient age
      was 11.7 years in IBD group, 7.4 years in non-IBD patients with diarrhea, and 7.4
      years in healthy children. The prevalence of C. perfringens infection was 9%
      (8/91; CI 95% 4.6-16.4). There were more Crohn's patients (6/8) in the C.
      perfringens positive group. There was no C. perfringens infection in the two
      control groups. CONCLUSION: Our pilot data add evidence to the hypothesis that
      Clostridia other than C. difficile may play a significant role in the clinical
      course of IBD. However, further studies are needed to confirm this.

LID - 10.1097/MIB.0b013e3182a82b15 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adjusting to symptom flares, treatment regimens, and side effects
      places youth with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) at increased risk for
      emotional and behavioral problems and adverse disease outcomes. Implementation of
      psychosocial screening into clinical practice remains a challenge. This study
      examines the clinical utility of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) screening
      in predicting disease outcome and healthcare utilization. METHODS: One hundred
      twelve youth of 7 to 18 years diagnosed with IBD and their parents. Youth
      completed standardized measures of HRQOL and depression. Parents completed a
      proxy report of HRQOL. Pediatric gastroenterologists provided the Physician
      Global Assessment. Families were recruited from a pediatric gastroenterology
      clinic. Retrospective chart reviews examined disease outcome and healthcare
      utilization for 12 months after baseline measurement. RESULTS: Linear
      regressions, controlling for demographic and disease parameters, revealed that
      baseline measurement of youth and parent proxy-reported HRQOL predicted the
      number of IBD-related hospital admissions, gastroenterology clinic visits,
      emergency department visits, psychology clinic visits, telephone contacts, and
      pain management referrals over the next 12 months. Disease outcome was not
      significant. CONCLUSIONS: Lower HRQOL was predictive of increased healthcare
      utilization among youth with IBD. Regular HRQOL screening may be the impetus to
      providing better case management and allocating resources based on ongoing care
      needs and costs. Proactive interventions focused on patients with poor HRQOL may 
      be an efficient approach to saving on healthcare costs and resource utilization.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is a well-established approach to
      the management of Crohn's disease. Aim. To determine effects of EEN upon
      inflammation and gut barrier function in a colitis mouse model. METHODS:
      Interleukin-10-deficient mice (IL-10(-/-)) were inoculated with Helicobacter
      trogontum and then treated with EEN, metronidazole, hydrocortisone, or EEN and
      metronidazole combination. Blood and tissue were collected at 2 and 4 weeks with 
      histology, mucosal integrity, tight junction integrity, inflammation, and H.
      trogontum load evaluated. RESULTS: H. trogontum induced colitis in IL-10(-/-)
      mice with histological changes in the cecum and colon. Elevated mucosal IL-8 mRNA
      in infected mice was associated with intestinal barrier dysfunction indicated by 
      decreased transepithelial electrical resistance and mRNA of tight junction
      proteins and increased short-circuit current, myosin light chain kinase mRNA,
      paracellular permeability, and tumor necrosis factor- alpha and myeloperoxidase
      plasma levels (P < 0.01 for all comparisons). EEN and metronidazole, but not
      hydrocortisone, treatments restored barrier function, maintained gut barrier
      integrity, and reversed inflammatory changes along with reduction of H. trogontum
      load (versus infected controls P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: H. trogontum infection in
      IL-10(-/-) mice induced typhlocolitis with intestinal barrier dysfunction. EEN
      and metronidazole, but not hydrocortisone, modulate barrier dysfunction and
      reversal of inflammatory changes.

AB  - Immunosuppression during the post-transplantation period has led to dramatic
      outcome improvements in PLTR patients. There have been reports describing the
      development of food allergies and an increased predilection for development of
      EGI in PLTR. We aimed to identify the clinical, endoscopic and histologic
      features of EGI in PLTR patients. In this retrospective case series we analyzed
      medical record of all PLTR who underwent EGD and/or colonoscopy at our
      institution from 2000 to 2006. From 2000 to 2006, 32 PLTR patients underwent
      endoscopic evaluation. Seventeen (53%) of 32 patients were diagnosed with EGI.
      Endoscopic abnormalities were seen in the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine
      in 11 (65%), 11 (65%), and four (24%) patients, respectively. Eosinophilic
      inflammation was seen in the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine in 13 (76%),
      10 (59%), and five (29%) patients, respectively. Nine of 17 patients underwent
      colonoscopy and endoscopic abnormalities were seen in four (44%) patients. Five
      patients (56%) had eosinophilic inflammation. In conclusion, we have
      characterized the clinical, endoscopic, and histologic features of EGI.
      Histologic and endoscopic examination reveals that, when present, EGI is often
      found at multiple segments along the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  - A decrease of the butyrate-producing species Roseburia hominis and
      Faecalibacterium prausnitzii defines dysbiosis in patients with ulcerative
      colitis.
PG  - 1275-83
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2013-304833 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacteria play an important role in the onset and perpetuation of
      intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Unlike in Crohn's
      disease (CD), in which dysbiosis has been better characterised, in ulcerative
      colitis (UC), only small cohorts have been studied and showed conflicting data.
      Therefore, we evaluated in a large cohort if the microbial signature described in
      CD is also present in UC, and if we could characterise predominant dysbiosis in
      UC. To assess the functional impact of dysbiosis, we quantified the bacterial
      metabolites. DESIGN: The predominant microbiota from 127 UC patients and 87 age
      and sex-matched controls was analysed using denaturing gradient gel
      electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis. Differences were quantitatively validated using 
      real-time PCR. Metabolites were quantified using gas chromatography-mass
      spectrometry. RESULTS: Based on DGGE analysis, the microbial signature previously
      described in CD was not present in UC. Real-time PCR analysis revealed a lower
      abundance of Roseburia hominis (p<0.0001) and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii
      (p<0.0001) in UC patients compared to controls. Both species showed an inverse
      correlation with disease activity. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) were reduced in
      UC patients (p=0.014), but no direct correlation between SCFA and the identified 
      bacteria was found. CONCLUSIONS: The composition of the fecal microbiota of UC
      patients differs from that of healthy individuals: we found a reduction in R
      hominis and F prausnitzii, both well-known butyrate-producing bacteria of the
      Firmicutes phylum. These results underscore the importance of dysbiosis in IBD
      but suggest that different bacterial species contribute to the pathogenesis of UC
      and CD.

TI  - Exploring associations of 6-thioguanine nucleotide levels and other predictive
      factors with therapeutic response to azathioprine in pediatric patients with IBD 
      using multilevel analysis.
PG  - 2404-10
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0b013e3182a508c6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Metabolite monitoring and response predictors to azathioprine (AZA)
      in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are debatable. In an attempt to
      optimize thiopurine therapy and understand the mechanism of action of
      thiopurines, we correlated metabolites and other factors with AZA efficacy in
      children with IBD. METHODS: Data from 86 children with IBD with 440 metabolite
      measurements were retrospectively analyzed using multilevel logistic regression
      analyses. A therapeutic response was defined as a pediatric Crohn's disease
      activity index </=10 for Crohn's disease or a pediatric ulcerative colitis
      activity index </=10 for ulcerative colitis without any treatment with steroids, 
      antitumor necrosis factor, other immunomodulators, or exclusive enteral
      nutrition. RESULTS: The 6-thioguanine nucleotide levels >250 pmol per 8 x 10 red 
      blood cells correlated with a higher response (odds ratio, 4.14; 95% confidence
      interval, 1.49-11.46, P = 0.007), whereas 6-methyl-mercaptopurine and
      6-methyl-mercaptopurine:6-thioguanine nucleotide ratio showed no correlation.
      Other novel response predictors in children with IBD were relative leukopenia
      (odds ratio, 14.01; 95% confidence interval, 3.77-52.10; P < 0.001) and the
      absence of lymphopenia (odds ratio, 3.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.26-10.89; P 
      = 0.017). Lower thiopurine methyltransferase activity (P = 0.015), lower platelet
      count (P = 0.020), and higher aspartate aminotransferase level (P = 0.009) also
      predicted therapeutic response. Age, gender, patient adherence, the duration of
      AZA therapy, IBD type, erythrocyte count, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate did 
      not predict efficacy. The high interindividual variability accounting for 57.7%
      of variance in therapeutic response was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The significant
      6-thioguanine nucleotide level-response relationship may support metabolite
      monitoring to improve thiopurine efficacy in pediatric IBD. The reported response
      predictors may be helpful for treatment optimization in AZA-treated children with
      IBD, but should be proved in prospective studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Curcumin, an active ingredient of turmeric with
      anti-inflammatory properties, has been demonstrated to be useful in experimental 
      models of ulcerative colitis (UC). It's efficacy in humans needs to be
      investigated. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, single-centre pilot trial was 
      conducted in patients with distal UC (<25 cm involvement) and mild-to-moderate
      disease activity. Forty-five patients were randomized to either NCB-02
      (standardized curcumin preparation) enema plus oral 5-ASA or placebo enema plus
      oral 5-ASA. Primary end point was disease response, defined as reduction in
      Ulcerative Colitis Diseases Activity Index by 3 points at 8 weeks, and secondary 
      end points were improvement in endoscopic activity and disease remission at 8
      weeks. RESULTS: Response to treatment was observed in 56.5% in NCB-02 group
      compared to 36.4% (p=0.175) in placebo group. At week 8, clinical remission was
      observed in 43.4% of patients in NCB-02 group compared to 22.7% in placebo group 
      (p=0.14) and improvement on endoscopy in 52.2% of patients in NCB-02 group
      compared to 36.4% of patients in placebo group (p=0.29). Per protocol analysis
      revealed significantly better outcomes in NCB-02 group, in terms of clinical
      response (92.9% vs. 50%, p=0.01), clinical remission (71.4% vs. 31.3%, p=0.03),
      and improvement on endoscopy (85.7% vs. 50%, p=0.04). CONCLUSION: In this pilot
      study we found some evidence that use of NCB-02 enema may tend to result in
      greater improvements in disease activity compared to placebo in patients with
      mild-to-moderate distal UC. The role of NCB-02 as a novel therapy for UC should
      be investigated further.

AB  - UNLABELLED: A variety of mechanisms have been proposed to explain the
      malnutrition and body mass loss in UC patients. The aim of the study trial was a 
      nutritional state assessment of 347 UC patients, admitted for surgical treatment,
      and the evaluation of the impact of this state on the postoperative course in
      this group of patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We referred the results of
      nutritional state assessment to the length of time of postoperative
      hospitalization of patients. RESULTS: Through application of the Kruskal-Wallis
      test we found statistically significant, but weakly expressed, differences
      between the values of nutritional state parameters and period of hospitalization 
      of patients. The applied U Mann-Whitney test, with statistically significant
      results with p <0.05, showed statistically significant differences between cured 
      and dead subgroups in: 1) loss of body mass in 6 months before hospitalization (p
      = 0.000033), 2) hemoglobin level (p = 0.006676), 3) total lymphocyte count (TLC) 
      (p = 0.025242), 4) total serum protein level (p = 0.003485), 5) serum albumin
      level (p =0.00165). Differences in BMI values were statistically negligible (p = 
      0.969397). CONCLUSIONS: The body mass loss in 6 months before admission, total
      lymphocyte count and serum albumin level are the reference parameters of the
      nutritional state of UC patients on admission to surgery.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: For over 1000 years, stool in various forms has been used to
      treat disease. Within the past few decades, fecal infusion either rectally or via
      a nasogastric tube has become a viable option for the treatment of refractory
      Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), and, more recently, it has shown promise
      in treating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and metabolic disease. The purpose
      of this article is to review the use of feces as a treatment option in pediatric 
      disease. RECENT FINDINGS: The majority of publications detailing the use of fecal
      infusion as a medical treatment have been case reports. In the first randomized
      controlled trial of its kind, fecal infusion via nasogastric tube was shown to be
      beneficial in treating refractory CDI in adults. In another first of its kind, a 
      pilot study on the use of fecal enemas to treat ulcerative colitis in pediatric
      patients found it to be well tolerated and effective. SUMMARY: The infusion of
      feces into the intestinal tract shows great promise for treatment and modulation 
      of a variety of intestinal and extraintestinal diseases. Defining the underlying 
      mechanism, microbes, and metabolites that mediate this effect will lead to more
      directed, safer, and potentially more effective treatments.

PG  - 2326-38
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0b013e3182a38a92 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mucosa-associated Escherichia coli are abundant in inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD), but whether these bacteria gain intracellular access within the
      mucosa is uncertain. If E. coli does gain intracellular access, the contribution 
      of bacterial pathogenicity to this requires further elucidation. This study aimed
      to quantify and characterize mucosa-associated and intracellular E. coli in
      patients with IBD and in healthy control subjects (HC). METHODS: Mucosal biopsies
      from 30 patients with Crohn's disease (CD), 15 with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 
      14 HC were cultured with or without gentamicin protection to recover
      intracellular or mucosa-associated E. coli, respectively. Overall, 40 strains
      (CD: n = 24, UC: n = 9, and HC: n = 7) were characterized by phylogenetic typing,
      adhesion and invasion assays, detection of virulence factors, antimicrobial
      resistance genes, and proteomic analysis. RESULTS: Mucosa-associated E. coli were
      more abundant in CD and UC than in HC (2750 versus 1350 versus 230 median
      colony-forming units per biopsy; P = 0.01). Intracellular E. coli were more
      prevalent in CD (90%) than in UC (47%) or HC mucosal biopsies (0%) (P < 0.001).
      Of 24 CD strains, 2 were adherent and invasive, but there were no unifying
      pathogenicity determinants that could distinguish most CD strains from UC or HC
      strains, or intracellular isolates from mucosa-associated isolates. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Intracellular E. coli are more common in CD than in UC and not identified in HC. 
      Most intracellular E. coli did not have characterizing pathogenic features,
      suggesting a significant role for defects in mucosal immunity or barrier
      dysfunction in their ability to gain intracellular access.

AB  - Rectal bleeding in neonates is an alarming sign that suggests a possible serious 
      underlying condition, such as infection or bleeding disorder that would
      necessitate hospitalization and prompt intervention. We report a case of
      eosinophilic gastroenteritis caused by cow's milk protein allergy in a one-day-
      old infant, who presented with frankly bloody stools associated with massive
      gastrointestinal and peripheral blood eosinophilia prior to initiation of enteral
      feedings. The patient's outcome was favorable, with complete spontaneous recovery
      in one week, after a period of bowel rest, parenteral nutrition, and use of amino
      acid formula. The eosinophilia was also transient and gradually resolving by two 
      months of age. Rectal bleeding secondary to allergic colitis caused by cow's milk
      sensitization may occur in neonates, and failure to appreciate this possibility
      may lead to inappropriate diagnostic or therapeutic intervention.

PG  - e779-83
LID - 10.1542/peds.2012-3344 [doi]
AB  - Hyperimmunoglobulinemia D is the less severe form of mevalonate kinase deficiency
      (MKD) caused by recessive inherited mutation in the mevalonate kinase gene.
      Hyperimmunoglobulinemia D is characterized by febrile attacks, often associated
      with transient digestive manifestations, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and
      vomiting. Here we report for the first time 2 patients with MKD revealed by
      severe neonatal colitis. Both patients had chronic bloody diarrhea and failure to
      thrive; 1 patient since the age of 1 month and the other since the age of 12
      days. Total parenteral nutrition was required. A marked elevation of acute phase 
      reactants was present, and no evidence of infection was found. In patient 1,
      ileocolonoscopy revealed ulcerative colitis at the age of 5 months. Patient 2
      suffered from enterocolitis and shock, associated with multiple bowel adhesions
      at age 5 weeks; the rectosigmoidoscopy showed aphtoid lesions of the sigmoid
      colon. Pathologic findings of colonic biopsies revealed a dense polymorph
      inflammatory infiltrate associated with deep ulcerations. Febrile attacks
      occurred 2 months after the onset of digestive symptoms in patient 1, and at
      onset of disease in patient 2. Genomic sequencing of the mevalonate kinase gene
      revealed compound heterozygous mutations in both patients. Anti-interleukin-1
      agent produced long-term remission of all digestive features and laboratory
      parameters. This report emphasizes that MKD may be the cause of severe
      early-onset inflammatory colitis, and must be considered by physicians, even in
      the absence of fever, after ruling out infections. Anti-interleukin-1 therapy may
      result in a dramatic improvement of MKD-related inflammatory bowel disease.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, which
      are both inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. Both types of
      inflammatory bowel disease have a complex etiology, resulting from a genetically 
      determined susceptibility interacting with environmental factors, including the
      diet and gut microbiota. Genome Wide Association Studies have implicated more
      than 160 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in disease susceptibility. Consideration
      of the different pathways suggested to be involved implies that specific dietary 
      interventions are likely to be appropriate, dependent upon the nature of the
      genes involved. Epigenetics and the gut microbiota are also responsive to dietary
      interventions. Nutrigenetics may lead to personalized nutrition for disease
      prevention and treatment, while nutrigenomics may help to understand the nature
      of the disease and individual response to nutrients.

TI  - Serum IL-17A in newly diagnosed treatment-naive patients with ulcerative colitis 
      reflects clinical disease severity and predicts the course of disease.
PG  - 2433-9

AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical course of ulcerative colitis (UC) is unpredictable. The 
      need for reliable biomarkers to reflect disease severity and predict disease
      course is therefore large. We investigated whether cytokines in mucosal tissue
      and serum reflect clinical disease severity at the onset of UC and predict the
      future disease course. METHODS: We prospectively monitored 102 patients from the 
      onset of UC during 3 years, and they were followed up yearly for clinical and
      biochemical disease severity. Rectal biopsies were obtained from healthy controls
      and patients with UC. Serum and stool samples were obtained from patients with
      UC. Total mRNA from biopsies was analyzed with real-time PCR. Cytokine levels in 
      serum were determined using Luminex or ELISA. RESULTS: Mucosal mRNA expression of
      IL-17A was 99.8 times higher while IFN-gamma and IL-13 expression was increased
      12.4 and 6.7 times, respectively, in patients relative to controls. Serum IL-17A 
      correlated with clinical disease severity at the onset. Also, contrary to a
      number of other parameters, serum IL-17A at the onset predicted the clinical and 
      biochemical course of the disease, as reflected by the Mayo score, number x
      severity of flares, and fecal calprotectin levels, respectively, during 3 years
      after the onset of the disease. None of these associations were found with
      mucosal cytokines at the onset. CONCLUSIONS: Serum IL-17A levels of
      treatment-naive patients with UC reflect clinical disease severity at the onset
      of the disease and also predicted the disease course over the following 3 years. 
      Thus, serum IL-17A may be valuable in the clinical management of patients with UC
      at the onset of the disease.

AB  - IBD includes two classic entities, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, and a 
      third undetermined form (IBD-U), characterized by a chronic relapsing course
      resulting in a high rate of morbidity and impaired quality of life. Children with
      IBD are vulnerable in terms of growth failure, malnutrition and emotional
      effects. The aims of therapy have now transitioned from symptomatic control to
      the achievement of mucosal healing and deep remission. This type of therapy has
      been made possible by the advent of disease-modifying drugs, such as biologic
      agents, which are capable of interrupting the inflammatory cascade underlying
      IBD. Biologic agents are generally administered in patients who are refractory to
      conventional therapies. However, there is growing support that such agents could 
      be used in the initial phases of the disease, typically in paediatric patients,
      to interrupt and cease the inflammatory process. Until several years ago, most
      therapeutic programmes in paediatric patients with IBD were borrowed from adult
      trials, whereas paediatric studies were often retrospective and uncontrolled.
      However, guidelines on therapeutic management of paediatric IBD and controlled,
      prospective, randomized trials including children with IBD have now been
      published. Here, the current knowledge concerning treatment options for children 
      with IBD are reported. We also highlight the effectiveness and safety of new
      therapeutic advances in these paediatric patients.

TI  - Functional polymorphisms in the regulatory regions of the VNN1 gene are
      associated with susceptibility to inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 2315-25
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0b013e3182a32b03 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vanin-1 is an epithelial pantetheinase, which regulates intestinal
      inflammation in mouse. We investigated whether human VNN1 levels could be
      associated to the susceptibility to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and
      explored the participation of PPARg to these processes. METHODS: We studied VNN1 
      expression in colon biopsies from IBD patients. We investigated polymorphisms in 
      the regulatory regions of the VNN1 gene and examined their genetic association
      with the disease. Functional relevance of these single-nucleotide polymorphisms
      (SNPs) was assayed, and we tested PPARg in nuclear complexes associated with
      specific VNN1 polymorphic sequences. In mouse, we examined Vanin-1 expression in 
      gut and feces during dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis and assayed the
      effect of PPARg on Vanin-1 regulation. RESULTS: VNN1 is expressed by enterocytes 
      and is upregulated in IBD. Three SNPs are statistically associated to IBD. The
      regions containing these SNPs specifically bind nuclear complexes and are
      correlated with the VNN1 transcript abundance in colon in an allele-dependent
      manner. One rare SNP is associated to severe ulcerative colitis with strong VNN1 
      and dropped PPARg levels. PPARg is involved in nuclear complexes that bound to
      VNN1 regulatory sites. Similarly, Vanin-1 is tightly regulated in the mouse gut
      in normal and colitis conditions and PPARg regulates its expression. CONCLUSIONS:
      VNN1 is a marker for IBD. Polymorphic positions in the VNN1 locus are direct
      targets for nuclear factors that might regulate the level of VNN1 in colon, and
      this could be linked to IBD susceptibility. It is hoped that modulating locally
      VNN1 expression or activity can be exploited to develop future therapeutic
      strategies against IBD.

AB  - PURPOSE: Poor sleep quality is associated with adverse health consequences. Sleep
      disturbances can impact the immune function and process of inflammation. The
      relationship between sleep quality and the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has
      not been well studied. METHODS: A prospective observational cohort study was
      performed to assess the correlation of the quality of sleep and disease activity 
      in IBD. We used the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) to measure sleep
      quality. IBD disease activity was measured by using the Harvey-Bradshaw Index or 
      Modified Mayo Score. RESULTS: Forty-one patients were enrolled with mean age of
      37 +/- 15.4 years and 27 (66%) women. Abnormal PSQI was present in all 23 (100%) 
      of the clinically active patients and in 13 (72%) of those with inactive disease 
      (odds ratio = 2.8, P = 0.007). All 30 patients with histologic evidence of
      inflammation on recent ileocolonoscopy also had abnormal PSQI scores, which were 
      independent of their clinical disease activity status. Only 6 of 11 patients with
      histologically quiescent disease had abnormal PSQI scores (odds ratio = 6.0, P < 
      0.0001). There was no difference in disease type, use of steroids, the presence
      of depression or anxiety, and body mass index between the patients with normal
      and abnormal sleep. An abnormal PSQI had a positive predictive value for
      histologic inflammatory activity of 83%. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show a strong
      association between clinically active IBD and poor sleep quality and demonstrate 
      that patients in clinical remission with abnormal sleep have a high likelihood of
      subclinical disease activity.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Crohn's disease (CD) patients are qualified for surgery in the acute 
      phase of the disease or after ineffective medical therapy. The course of the
      disease and the medical treatment received to that point weaken the general state
      of patients, with that they also cause undernutrition. THE AIM OF THE STUDY: The 
      assessment of the nutritional state of 168 CD patients, admitted for surgery and 
      the evaluation of the influence of this state on the postoperative course.
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: We referred the results of the nutritional state assessment
      to the time of the postoperative hospitalization of patients. RESULTS: Applying
      the Kruskal-Wallis test we found statistically significant, but weakly expressed,
      differences between the values of nutritional state parameters and period of
      hospitalization of patients. The applied U Mann-Whitney test, with statistically 
      significant results with p <0.05, showed that no one parameter of the nutritional
      state of patients expressed a statistically significant difference between dead
      and recovered groups. CONCLUSIONS: We propose the body mass loss in the 6 months 
      period before admission, TLC and serum albumin level as parameters which well
      detect undernutrition in CD patients presenting for surgery.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The association of fatigue with decreased physical performance
      and underlying mechanisms are poorly understood in Crohn's disease (CD). We aimed
      to measure and compare self-reported fatigue with skeletal muscle fatigue in CD
      subjects and healthy controls, and to identify associated factors that may be
      amenable to change. METHODS: Demographic and clinical data were collected and
      fatigue assessed using the Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS) in 27 consecutive CD
      patients and 22 matched healthy controls. Circulating cytokines and growth
      factors were measured. The rate of quadriceps muscle fatigue was assessed using
      an isokinetic dynamometer as the decrement of force with 30 contractions
      performed over a 5-minute period. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, CD
      patients reported greater levels of fatigue (mean global FIS score 45.3 vs 10.5, 
      physical dimension score 12.3 vs 2.7 respectively; each p<0.01) and muscle
      fatigue (-5.2 vs -1.3 Nm min(-1); p<0.05). The two indices were correlated (r =
      -0.52 in CD; p<0.01). Patients with CD had lower mean serum IGF-1 levels (16.1 vs
      25.4 pmol/L, p<0.01) and higher oxidative stress (TBARS assay 4.3 vs 3.9 muM,
      p<0.05). On multivariate analysis, low serum vitamin D, IGF-1 and magnesium, and 
      higher IL-6 levels were associated with increased muscle fatigue (all p </=
      0.05). CONCLUSION: Subjects with CD had more muscle fatigue than matched healthy 
      controls and this correlated well with self-reported fatigue. Of circulating
      factors that were independently associated with increased muscle fatigue, vitamin
      D, magnesium and IGF-1 could be targeted in future studies to reduce fatigue and 
      improve physical performance.

AB  - Since the introduction of biological therapy, endoscopic and histological
      remission, i.e. mucosal healing, has become an important therapeutic goal in
      Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis. Mucosal healing is associated with lower 
      rates of hospitalization and surgery, although its role in preventing progression
      and changing the natural history of the disease has not been clearly
      demonstrated. A precise definition of mucosal healing has not yet been
      established, although the concept used in clinical trials is the "complete
      absence of all inflammatory and ulcerative lesions in all segments of gut" at
      endoscopy. This definition does not include mucosal improvement and does not
      distinguish among grades of mucosal healing. In both Crohn's Disease and
      Ulcerative Colitis trials, several qualitative and quantitative numeric
      endoscopic indices have been proposed to measure and distinguish endoscopic
      changes. In addition, the microscopic features associated with inflammatory bowel
      diseases are considerably modified by the course of the disease and the
      treatments adopted. However, it is not yet clear whether microscopic healing
      should be a primary endpoint in clinical trials. In this paper we discuss
      endoscopic and histological findings and the limitations of the endoscopic and
      histological indices as a basis for a standardised diagnosis of mucosal healing.

TI  - Abdominal pain in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 2207-14
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0b013e31829614c6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic pain is common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease
      and often attributed to inflammation. However, many patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease without evidence of active disease continue to experience pain.
      This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of pain in patients with
      ulcerative colitis (UC) and examine the role of inflammation and psychiatric
      comorbidities in patients with UC with pain. METHODS: We performed a
      retrospective cross-sectional analysis of adult patients with UC seen at a
      tertiary referral inflammatory bowel disease center. Age, gender, disease
      duration and extent, abdominal pain rating, quality of life, physician global
      assessment, endoscopic and histological rating of disease severity, C reactive
      protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were abstracted. RESULTS: A total of 
      1268 patients were identified using billing codes for colitis. Five hundred and
      two patients (48.2% women) met all inclusion criteria. Two hundred and sixty-two 
      individuals (52.2%) complained of abdominal pain, with 108 individuals (21.5%)
      describing more frequent pain ("some of the time or more"). Of those with
      quiescent disease (n = 326), 33 patients (10%) complained of more frequent pain. 
      Physician global assessment, endoscopic and histological severity rating,
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C reactive protein significantly correlated
      with pain ratings. The best predictors of pain were physician global assessment, 
      C reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, female gender, and
      coexisting mood disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal pain affects more than 50% of
      patients with UC. Although inflammation is important, the skewed gender
      distribution and correlation with mood disorders highlight parallels with
      functional bowel disorders and suggest a significant role for central mechanisms.
      Management strategies should thus go beyond a focus on inflammation and also
      include interventions that target psychological mechanisms of pain.

AB  - Neutropenic enterocolitis is a potentially fatal complication of myeloablative
      chemotherapy in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Omega-3 polyunsaturated
      fatty acids (PUFA) are precursors of potent anti-inflammatory prostaglandins. Our
      aim was to explore the safety and effectiveness of omega-3 PUFA added to
      parenteral nutrition in protecting leukemia patients from severe enterocolitis.
      Fourteen patients with acute myeloid leukemia who received omega-3 PUFA in a
      Phase II trial were compared with 66 consecutive control patients not getting
      this intervention. We performed crude and adjusted comparisons, using inverse
      probability of treatment weighting for adjusted analysis, and blind outcome
      assessment to minimize assessor bias. Primary outcome was severe enterocolitis
      (>/=Grade 3). The crude odds ratio of Grade 3 colitis or higher was 1.36 (95% CI 
      0.37 to 4.96, P = 0.64), and the adjusted odds ratio was 0.79 (95% CI 0.35 to
      1.78, P = 0.57). There was little evidence to suggest differences between groups 
      in serious adverse events and overall mortality. Our results provide little
      evidence that addition of omega-3 PUFA is beneficial in this condition. Routine
      treatment with omega-3 PUFA is currently not warranted.

TI  - The epidemiology of anemia in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease: prevalence
      and associated factors at diagnosis and follow-up and the impact of exclusive
      enteral nutrition.
PG  - 2411-22
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0b013e31829ed855 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anemia is poorly studied in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease.
      This study explored the epidemiology and associated factors of anemia at
      diagnosis, after 1 year, and during treatment with exclusive enteral nutrition
      (EEN). METHODS: Three cohorts were included: (1) a representative population of
      newly diagnosed inflammatory bowel disease children (n = 184); (2) patients
      currently receiving care with data available at diagnosis (n = 179) and after 1
      year (n = 139); and (3) 84 children treated with EEN. RESULTS: At diagnosis, 72% 
      were anemic. Abnormal inflammatory markers were more common in Crohn's disease
      with severe anemia (severe versus no anemia [%]: raised C-reactive protein; 89%
      versus 48%; suboptimal albumin; 97% versus 29%; P < 0.002). Anemic children with 
      Crohn's disease had shorter diagnosis delay and lower BMI than nonanemic patients
      (severe versus mild versus no anemia, median [interquartile range]; diagnosis
      delay [months]: 3 [3.9] versus 6 [10] versus 8 [18], P < 0.001; BMI z score [SD]:
      -1.4 [1.4] versus -1.3 [1.5] versus -0.2 [1.4], P = 0.003). Extensive colitis was
      associated with severe anemia in ulcerative colitis. The proportion of severely
      anemic patients decreased from 34% to 9% and mild anemia doubled at 1 year. After
      EEN, severe anemia decreased (32% to 9%; P < 0.001) and the hemoglobin
      concentration increased by 0.75 g/dL. This was observed only after 8 weeks of
      treatment. Disease improvement and low hemoglobin at EEN initiation but not
      weight gain were associated with hemoglobin improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Anemia is
      high at diagnosis and follow-up and should receive more attention from the
      clinical team; however, the focus should remain suppression of inflammatory
      process in active disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The level of fecal calprotectin (FC) can predict the onset of 
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with high accuracy and precision. We evaluated
      the cost-effectiveness of using measurements of FC to identify adults and
      children who require endoscopic confirmation of IBD. METHODS: We constructed a
      decision analytic tree to compare the cost-effectiveness of measuring FC before
      endoscopy examination with that of direct endoscopic evaluation alone. A second
      decision analytic tree was constructed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of FC
      cutoff levels of 100 mug/g vs 50 mug/g (typically used to screen for intestinal
      inflammation). The primary outcome measure was the incremental cost required to
      avoid 1 false-negative result by using FC level to diagnose new-onset IBD.
      RESULTS: In adults, FC screening saved $417/patient but delayed diagnosis for
      2.2/32 patients with IBD among 100 screened patients. In children, FC screening
      saved $300/patient but delayed diagnosis for 4.8/61 patients with IBD among 100
      screened patients. If endoscopic biopsy analysis remained the standard for
      diagnosis, direct endoscopic evaluation would cost an additional $18,955 in
      adults and $6250 in children to avoid 1 false-negative result from FC screening. 
      Sensitivity analyses showed that cost-effectiveness of FC screening varied with
      the sensitivity of the test and the pre-test probability of IBD in adults and
      children. Pre-test probabilities for IBD of </=75% in adults and </=65% in
      children made FC screening cost-effective, but it was cost-ineffective if the
      probabilities were >/=85% and >/=78% in adults and children, respectively.
      Compared with the FC cutoff level of 100 mug/g, the cutoff level of 50 mug/g cost
      an additional $55 and $43 for adults and children, respectively, but it yielded
      2.4 and 6.1 additional accurate diagnoses of IBD per 100 screened adults and
      children, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Screening adults and children to measure
      fecal levels of calprotectin is effective and cost-effective in identifying those
      with IBD on a per-case basis when the pre-test probability is </=75% for adults
      and </=65% for children. The utility of the test is greater for adults than
      children. Increasing the FC cutoff level to >/=50 mug/g increases diagnostic
      accuracy without substantially increasing total cost.

TI  - A pilot study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an oral dose of
      (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate-rich polyphenon E in patients with mild to
      moderate ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1904-12
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0b013e31828f5198 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Green tea and its main polyphenolic component,
      (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), exert powerful anti-inflammatory effects
      that are protective against both inflammatory diseases and cancer. Research with 
      animal and human cell lines provide plausible support for these claims. Poor
      absorption results in low systemic bioavailability of EGCG after oral
      administration but high colonic mucosal exposure. METHODS: Patients with mild to 
      moderate ulcerative colitis (UC) were randomized to daily doses of oral
      Polyphenon E (400 mg or 800 mg of total EGCG daily, administered in split doses) 
      or placebo in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled pilot study. Response was
      measured by the UC disease activity index and the inflammatory bowel disease
      questionnaire on day 56. RESULTS: Twenty patients were randomized to active
      therapy or placebo in a 4:1 ratio. Nineteen subjects received >1 dose of study
      medication (15 Polyphenon E, 4 placebo). The mean UC disease activity index score
      at study entry was 6.5 +/- 1.9 in the treatment group and 7.3 +/- 1.7 in the
      placebo group. After 56 days of therapy, the response rate was 66.7% (10 of 15)
      in the Polyphenon E group and 0% (0 of 4) in the placebo group (P = 0.03). The
      active treatment remission rate was 53.3% (8 of 15) compared with 0% (0 of 4) for
      placebo (P = 0.10). Polyphenon E treatment resulted in only minor side effects.
      CONCLUSIONS: Administration of Polyphenon E resulted in a therapeutic benefit for
      patients who were refractory to 5-aminosalicylic and/or azathioprine. This agent 
      holds promise as a novel option for the treatment of patients with UC with mild
      to moderately active disease.

TI  - Why interleukin-10 supplementation does not work in Crohn's disease patients.
PG  - 3931-41
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v19.i25.3931 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative
      colitis are chronic intestinal disorders, which are on the increase in
      "Westernised" countries. IBD can be caused by both genetic and environmental
      factors. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an immunoregulatory cytokine that has been
      identified as being involved in several diseases including IBD. Studies have
      shown that polymorphisms in the promoter region reduce serum levels of IL-10 and 
      this reduction has been associated with some forms of IBD. Mouse models have
      shown promising results with IL-10 supplementation, as such IL-10 supplementation
      has been touted as being a possible alternative treatment for CD in humans.
      Clinical trials have shown that recombinant human IL-10 is safe and well
      tolerated up to a dose of 8 mug/kg. However, to date, the results of the clinical
      trials have been disappointing. Although CD activity was reduced as measured by
      the CD activity index, IL-10 supplementation did not result in significantly
      reduced remission rates or clinical improvements when compared to placebo. This
      review discusses why IL-10 supplementation is not effective in CD patients
      currently and what can be addressed to potentially make IL-10 supplementation a
      more viable treatment option in the future. Based on the current research we
      conclude that IL-10 supplementation is not a one size fits all treatment and if
      the correct population of patients is chosen then IL-10 supplementation could be 
      of benefit.

TI  - Pathobiology and potential therapeutic value of intestinal short-chain fatty
      acids in gut inflammation and obesity.
PG  - 2756-66
LID - 10.1007/s10620-013-2744-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The lumen of the gastrointestinal tract contains many substances
      produced from the breakdown of foodstuffs, from salivary, esophageal, intestinal,
      hepatic, and pancreatic secretions, and from sloughed cells present in the
      gastrointestinal lumen. Although these substances were traditionally regarded as 
      waste products, there is increasing realization that many can be biologically
      active, either as signalling compounds or as nutrients. For example, proteins are
      broken down into amino acids, which are then sensed by nutrient receptors. The
      gut microbiome, which is at highest abundance in the ileocecum, has powerful
      metabolic activity, digesting and breaking down unabsorbed carbohydrates,
      proteins, and other ingested nutrients into phenols, amines, volatile organic
      compounds, methane, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and hydrogen sulfide into volatile 
      fatty acids, also called short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). CONCLUSION: These
      latter substances are the topic of this review. In this review, we will briefly
      discuss recent advances in the understanding SCFA production, signalling, and
      absorption, followed by a detailed description and discussion of trials of SCFAs,
      probiotics, and prebiotics in the treatment of gastrointestinal disease, in
      particular ulcerative colitis (UC), pouchitis, short bowel syndrome, and obesity.

AB  - Neonatal-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) accounts for only 0.25% of
      pediatric IBD cases. The molecular pathogenesis of IBD remains unclear. Recently,
      rare Mendelian mutations have been identified in children with very early-onset
      Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. In this study, we report compound
      heterozygous mutations in the interleukin-10 receptor A (IL-10RA) gene in
      children with severe neonatal-onset IBD. Patient 1 had chronic diarrhea within
      the first month of life and had perianal fistulae. She was diagnosed with
      'intractable ulcerating enterocolitis in infancy' and underwent subtotal
      colectomy at the age of 24 months because of poor response to immunosuppressant
      therapy. Compound heterozygous mutations, c.[301C>T];[350G>A](p.[R101W];[R117H]),
      were discovered in IL-10RA for this patient. Patient 2 presented symptoms within 
      the first month of life and was diagnosed with Crohn's disease. Severe colitis
      and perianal and enteroenteric fistulae occurred repeatedly, and he underwent
      surgical management involving colectomy, colostomy, and ileostomy. We identified 
      mutations in IL-10RA, c.[272A>G];[784C>T] (p.[Y91C];[R262C]). Patient 3 had
      chronic diarrhea and a rectovaginal fistula at 3 days of life and was diagnosed
      with Crohn's disease. She underwent fistulectomy and ileostomy, but experienced
      frequent relapses. Mutations, c.[272A>G];[301C>T] (p.[Y91C];[R101W]), were found 
      in IL-10RA. This report confirms the genetic defect of IL-10RA in neonatal-onset 
      IBD including 'intractable ulcerating enterocolitis in infancy'.

TI  - The role of endoscopy and biopsy in the management of severe gastrointestinal
      disease in cystic fibrosis patients.
PG  - 1181-9
LID - 10.1002/ppul.22697 [doi]
AB  - There is increasing evidence to suggest the presence of chronic inflammation in
      the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Some CF
      patients continue to have very severe gastrointestinal symptoms despite
      conventional CF treatment. In our center, these patients are managed in a CF
      gastroenterology clinic, jointly with a pediatric gastroenterologist. A number
      have required GI endoscopy and biopsy. The aim of our study was to characterize
      these patients and determine whether endoscopy and biopsy changed their
      management. We reviewed all the patients seen in the CF gastroenterology clinic
      from 2004 to 2009, who had GI endoscopies performed. The GI symptoms these
      patients were experiencing included abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, rectal
      bleeding, failure to thrive, loose stools, and constipation. Twelve patients had 
      GI endoscopies with mucosal biopsies performed. The median [interquartile range
      (IQR)] age at referral to the CF gastroenterology clinic was 4 years [0.9-8].
      Their body mass index (BMI) was 15.2 [13.7-15.5]. Twenty-five percent were
      homozygous delta F508. Two patients had previously had meconium ileus as neonates
      requiring surgical intervention. One other patient had needed abdominal surgery
      for intussusception. Ninty-two percent were pancreatic insufficient, 25% were
      chronically infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 17% were on regularly 3
      monthly intravenous antibiotics. Of the 10 patients who were able to perform
      spirometry, FEV1 was 101% [67-125] predicted. Nine of the 12 patients had
      evidence of mucosal inflammation in their biopsies, including duodenitis with
      eosinophilic infiltrate, chronic non-specific inactive gastritis, enteropathy
      with partial villous atrophy, and non-specific colitis. Immunosuppressive and
      anti-inflammatory therapies were commenced in these nine patients, including
      prednisolone, azathioprine, methotrexate, ketotifen, mesalazine, and
      sulfasalazine as well as the use of parenteral nutrition and elemental feeds. All
      the patients clinically responded to therapy. Five of the patients commenced on
      anti-inflammatory therapy had repeat biopsies 1-5 years following commencement of
      treatment and all showed histological improvement of the mucosal inflammation. GI
      endoscopy with mucosal biopsy has a significant role to play in the management of
      CF children with severe GI disease. In our study, it influenced the management in
      the majority of patients with severe GI symptoms. Furthermore, if GI mucosal
      inflammation is identified on biopsy, management with immunomodulatory agents may
      be clinically beneficial.

TI  - Trends in hospitalizations of children with inflammatory bowel disease within the
      United States from 2000 to 2009.
PG  - 1036-8
LID - 10.2310/JIM.0b013e31829a4e25 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence and prevalence of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease 
      (IBD) seems to be increasing in North America and Europe. Our objective was to
      evaluate hospitalization rates in children with IBD in the United States during
      the decade 2000 to 2009. METHODS: We analyzed cases with a discharge diagnosis of
      Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) within the Healthcare Cost and
      Utilization Project Kids' Inpatient Database, Agency for Healthcare Research and 
      Quality. RESULTS: We identified 61,779 pediatric discharges with a diagnosis of
      IBD (CD, 39,451 cases; UC, 22,328 cases). The number of hospitalized children
      with IBD increased from 11,928 to 19,568 (incidence, 43.5-71.5 cases per 10,000
      discharges per year; P < 0.001). For CD, the number increased from 7757 to 12,441
      (incidence, 28.3-45.0; P < 0.001) and for UC, 4171 to 7127 (15.2-26.0; P <
      0.001). Overall, there was a significant increasing trend for pediatric
      hospitalizations with IBD, CD, and UC (P < 0.001). In addition, there was an
      increase in IBD-related complications and comorbid disease burden (P < 0.01).
      CONCLUSION: There was a significant increase in the number and incidence of
      hospitalized children with IBD in the United States from 2000 to 2009.

TI  - The impact of physical activity and nutrition on inflammatory bowel disease: the 
      potential role of cross talk between adipose tissue and skeletal muscle.
PG  - 143-55
AB  - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are both chronic inflammatory bowel
      diseases (IBDs) characterized by a cyclical nature, which alternates between
      active and quiescent states, ultimately impairing a patients' quality of life.
      The etiology of IBD is not known but it likely involves a combination of genetic 
      predisposition and environmental risk factors. Physical exercise has been
      suggested to provide protection against the onset of IBD, but there are
      inconsistencies in the findings of the published literature. Current research
      recommends exercise to help counteract some IBD-specific complications and
      preliminary studies suggest that physical activity may be beneficial in reducing 
      the symptoms of IBD. Obesity is becoming more prevalent in patients diagnosed
      with IBD and may be associated with higher disease activity. There is evidence
      that adipokines are involved in the inflammatory and metabolic pathways.
      Hypertrophy of the mesenteric white adipose tissue has been long recognized as a 
      characteristic feature of Crohn's disease; however its importance is unknown.
      Recent data suggest that dysregulation of adipokine secretion by white adipose
      tissue is involved in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Skeletal muscle was
      shown to produce biologically active myokines, which could be a important
      contributor to the beneficial effects of exercise. There is mounting evidence for
      the bi-directional endocrine cross talk between adipose tissue and skeletal
      muscle. The objective of the present review is to explore the role of exercise
      and its impact on IBD. Also, we discuss how current discoveries regarding the
      importance of adipokines and myokines and their cross talk expand our view of the
      pathological changes and the therapeutic options for IBD.

TI  - Correlations of plasma citrulline levels with clinical and endoscopic score and
      blood markers according to small bowel involvement in pediatric Crohn disease.
PG  - 570-5
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e31829e264e [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Several studies have indicated that plasma citrulline levels reflect
      the extent of mucosal injury of the small intestine. This study was performed to 
      determine whether plasma citrulline levels correlate with the disease activity in
      pediatric patients with Crohn disease (CD). METHODS: A total of 63 CD and 23
      ulcerative colitis (UC) patients were included in this study. Disease severity
      was assessed by pediatric CD activity index (PCDAI), pediatric UC activity index,
      simplified endoscopic activity score for CD, C-reactive protein (CRP), and
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). The correlations among these variables and 
      plasma citrulline levels were evaluated. We performed subgroup analysis whether
      correlations between plasma citrulline levels and disease activity depend on
      small bowel involvement in patients with CD. RESULTS: The plasma citrulline
      levels correlated negatively with CRP (r = -0.332, P = 0.008), ESR (r = -0.290, P
      = 0.022), and PCDAI (r = -0.424, P = 0.001) in patients with CD. The plasma
      citrulline levels were significantly lower in patients with jejunal involvement
      than in those without (P = 0.027). In subgroup analysis, patients with CD with
      jejunal involvement showed significantly negative correlations of plasma
      citrulline levels with CRP (r = -0.628, P = 0.016) and PCDAI (r = -0.632, P =
      0.015); however, patients with CD without jejunal involvement revealed no
      correlations of plasma citrulline levels with CRP and PCDAI. There were no
      significant correlations between plasma citrulline levels and simplified
      endoscopic activity score for CD. There were no significant correlations of
      plasma citrulline levels with CRP, ESR, and pediatric UC activity index in
      patients with UC. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma citrulline levels correlated with disease
      severity as measured by PCDAI, CRP, and ESR in pediatric patients with CD with
      jejunal involvement.

TI  - Inadequate nutrient intake in patients with celiac disease: results from a German
      dietary survey.
PG  - 240-6
LID - 10.1159/000348850 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently, the only treatment for celiac disease (CD) is a lifelong
      gluten-free diet (GFD). Research has been carried out in various countries into
      the nutritional adequacy of the GFD in terms of macro- and micronutrients, mostly
      presenting conflicting results. However, no data for Germany are available to
      date. AIM: To elucidate the nutritional composition of a GFD and to compare it
      with non-GFD in a representative German non-CD population. METHODS AND PATIENTS: 
      A total of 1,000 patients who were members of the German Celiac Society (DZG)
      were invited to fill out a prospective 7-day food diary and a questionnaire. Data
      from 88 patients aged 14-80 years were analyzed and compared to the DACH
      reference values and to data from the German National Diet and Nutrition Survey
      (NVS II). RESULTS: No significant difference was observed for the intake of
      energy and macronutrients in male celiac patients compared to the NVS II. Only
      the fiber intake of male patients was significantly lower than that of the
      general population. Female patients, however, showed a significantly higher fat
      intake, but lower carbohydrate consumption. The average daily micronutrient
      intake of male and female patients, specifically of vitamin B1, B2, B6, folic
      acid, magnesium and iron, was significantly lower in celiac patients compared to 
      the NVS II. CONCLUSION: This study reveals inadequate nutrient intake by male and
      female celiac patients in Germany. Based on our findings, regular (laboratory)
      monitoring of celiac patients should be recommended.

TI  - Characterization of IBS-like symptoms in patients with ulcerative colitis in
      clinical remission.
PG  - 756-e578
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12163 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal symptoms compatible with Irritable Bowel Syndrome
      (IBS) are common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. It has been
      suggested that these symptoms are a reflection of occult inflammation rather than
      coexisting IBS. The aim of this study was to characterize IBS-like symptoms in
      patients with Ulcerative Colitis (UC) in clinical remission by assessing
      inflammatory markers, psychological symptoms, and quality of life. METHODS:
      Ninety-four patients with new onset of UC were followed prospectively during 3
      years with yearly follow-up visits. The patients completed self-administrated
      questionnaires. Fecal calprotectin was used as an inflammatory biomarker.
      Remission was defined as a total Mayo-score </=2 and an endoscopic subscore </=1,
      with no relapse during the 3-month period prior to visit. KEY RESULTS: The
      prevalence of patients that fulfilled Rome II criteria for IBS among UC patients 
      in remission was 11% at visit 1, 23% at visit 2, and 17% at visit 3. When
      comparing UC patients in remission with and without IBS-like symptom, patients
      with IBS-like symptoms had more severe gastrointestinal symptoms, tendencies
      toward more severe psychological symptoms and reduced levels of quality of life, 
      but the calprotectin levels did not differ between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS & 
      INFERENCES: IBS-like symptoms are common in patients with UC in clinical
      remission and these fluctuate over time. The symptoms are associated with poor
      psychological well-being and reduced quality of life, and do not seem to be a
      reflection of low-grade inflammatory activity.

TI  - Infliximab inhibits activation and effector functions of peripheral blood T cells
      in vitro from patients with clinically active ulcerative colitis.

AB  - Many patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are undergoing therapy with
      infliximab, an antibody specific for TNF. However, the exact mechanisms of action
      of infliximab are not completely understood. The aim of this study was to
      determine the in vitro effects of infliximab on blood T cells derived from
      anti-TNF therapy-naive ulcerative colitis (UC) patients with clinically active
      disease. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated polyclonally or by
      antigen in the presence or absence of infliximab. The T cell phenotype was
      investigated by flow cytometry, cytokine secretion was determined by ELISA, and
      cell proliferation was determined by thymidine assay or CFSE dye. Presence of
      infliximab resulted in reduced expression of CD25 in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell
      populations and inhibited secretion of IFN-gamma, IL-13, IL-17A, TNF as well as
      granzyme A. Infliximab also suppressed CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell proliferation.
      These effects of infliximab were recorded both in T cells activated by polyclonal
      and antigen-specific stimulation. The effects of infliximab on T cell apoptosis
      and induction of FOXP3(+) CD4(+) T regulatory cells were ambiguous and depended
      on the originating cellular source and/or the stimulation mode and strength. In
      conclusion, infliximab is able to reduce T cell activation as measured by CD25,
      proliferation and cytokine secretion in vitro from UC patients with clinically
      active disease. These data suggest that suppression of T cell activity may be
      important for infliximab-mediated disease remission in patients with UC.

TI  - Polymerase chain reaction test for Clostridium difficile toxin B gene reveals
      similar prevalence rates in children with and without inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 293-7
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3182999990 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Clinicians often evaluate for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) presenting with exacerbations. A
      highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for the toxin B gene of C
      difficile is increasingly used to diagnose CDI. The aim of this study was to
      determine the prevalence of positive C difficile PCR results in children and
      young adults with and without active IBD compared with patients with non-IBD
      gastrointestinal disease. METHODS: Fecal samples were obtained from patients with
      ulcerative colitis (UC, n = 76) or Crohn disease (CD, n = 69) and 51 controls
      followed in our gastroenterology program. Samples were analyzed for C difficile
      using a PCR test for the C difficile toxin B gene (BD GeneOhm Cdiff assay).
      Proportions of positive tests in each group were compared using the Pearson chi2 
      test. RESULTS: The prevalence of positive PCR results was 11.6% in patients with 
      CD, 18.4% in patients with UC, and 11.8% in controls (P = 0.25). There were no
      significant differences in the prevalence of positive C difficile results among
      patients with IBD with and without active disease or among patients with and
      without diarrhea. CONCLUSIONS: Positive C difficile PCR results occur with
      similar frequency in patients with IBD with and without active disease and in
      patients with other gastrointestinal diseases. A positive result in a highly
      sensitive PCR assay that detects low copy numbers of a toxin gene in C difficile 
      may reflect colonization in a subset of patients with IBD, confounding clinical
      decision making in managing disease exacerbations.

TI  - Fecal chromogranins and secretogranins are increased in patients with ulcerative 
      colitis but are not associated with disease activity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known of the importance of chromogranins (Cg) and
      secretogranins (Sg) in ulcerative colitis (UC). We therefore investigated fecal
      levels of CgA, CgB, SgII and SgIII, and their association with inflammatory
      activity, disease duration and medical therapy in UC. METHODS: Analyses of CgA,
      CgB, SgII, SgIII and calprotectin in stool samples from 41 UC patients and 29
      healthy controls were performed. Two stool samples, during relapse and remission,
      respectively, were obtained from each UC patient. RESULTS: The levels of fecal
      CgA and SgII were higher in UC patients with active disease as compared to
      healthy controls. CgB and SgII were positively correlated with disease duration, 
      but none of the granins were positively correlated with calprotectin, Mayo score,
      CRP or serum concentrations of TNF in UC patients with active disease. Also UC
      patients in remission had higher levels of CgA, CgB, SgII, and SgIII as compared 
      to healthy controls. However, levels of fecal CgA, CgB, SgII and SgIII were lower
      during active disease relative to remission. Moreover, fecal levels of CgA and
      SgII were higher in UC patients in remission treated with thiopurines than in
      thiopurine-naive patients in remission. CONCLUSION: Fecal chromogranins and
      secretogranins are increased in UC but are not associated with disease activity, 
      but seem to increase with duration of the disease. Thus, fecal granins might
      reflect structural changes associated with chronicity of disease, or medical
      therapy.

TI  - Primary sclerosing cholangitis, autoimmune hepatitis, and overlap in Utah
      children: epidemiology and natural history.
PG  - 1392-400
LID - 10.1002/hep.26454 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: The epidemiology and natural history of pediatric primary sclerosing 
      cholangitis (PSC), autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis (ASC), and autoimmune
      hepatitis (AIH) are not well characterized. Using multiple, overlapping search
      strategies followed by a detailed records review, we identified all cases of
      pediatric PSC, ASC, AIH, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in a geographically
      isolated region of the United States. We identified 607 cases of IBD, 29 cases of
      PSC, 12 cases of ASC, and 44 cases of AIH. The mean age at diagnosis was 13.0
      years for PSC, 11.3 years for ASC, and 9.8 years for AIH. The incidence and
      prevalence of PSC, ASC, and AIH were 0.2 and 1.5 cases, 0.1 and 0.6 cases, and
      0.4 and 3.0 cases per 100,000 children, respectively. The mean duration of
      follow-up was 5.9 years. The probability of developing complicated liver disease 
      within 5 years of the diagnosis of liver disease was 37% [95% confidence interval
      (CI) = 21%-58%] for PSC, 25% (95% CI = 7%-70%) for ASC, and 15% (95% CI = 7%-33%)
      for AIH. The 5-year survival rates with the native liver were 78% (95% CI =
      54%-91%) for PSC, 90% (95% CI = 47%-99%) for ASC, and 87% (95% CI = 71%-95%) for 
      AIH. Cholangiocarcinoma developed in 2 of the 29 PSC patients (6.9%). PSC
      occurred in 9.9% of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and in 0.6% of patients
      with Crohn's disease (CD). ASC occurred in 2.3% of UC patients and 0.9% of CD
      patients. AIH occurred in 0.4% of UC patients and in 0.3% of CD patients. Liver
      disease occurred in 39 of 607 IBD patients (6.4%) overall. CONCLUSION:
      Immune-mediated liver diseases are important sources of morbidity in children.
      Using a population-based design, this study quantifies the burden and natural
      history of immune-mediated liver disease in children.

AB  - AIM: A Belgian registry for pediatric Crohn's disease, BELCRO, was created. This 
      first report aims at describing disease presentation and phenotype and
      determining associations between variables at diagnosis and registration in the
      database. METHODS: Through a collaborative network, children with previously
      established Crohn's disease and newly diagnosed children and adolescents (under
      18 y of age) were recruited over a 2 year period. Data were collected by 23
      centers and entered in a database. Statistical association tests analyzed
      relationships between variables of interest at diagnosis. RESULTS: Two hundred
      fifty-five patients were included. Median age at diagnosis was 12.5 y (range:
      1.6-18 y); median duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis was 3 m (range: 1-12
      m). Neonatal history and previous medical history did not influence disease onset
      nor disease behavior. Fifty three % of these patients presented with a BMI
      z-score < -1. CRP was an independent predictor of disease severity. Steroids were
      widely used as initial treatment in moderate to severe and extensive disease.
      Over time, immunomodulators and biological were prescribed more frequently,
      reflecting a lower prescription rate for steroids and 5-ASA. A positive family
      history was the sole significant determinant for earlier use of
      immunosuppression. CONCLUSION: In Belgium, the median age of children presenting 
      with Crohn's disease is 12.5 y. Faltering growth, extensive disease and upper GI 
      involvement are frequent. CRP is an independent predictive factor of disease
      activity. A positive family history appears to be the main determinant for
      initial treatment choice.

AB  - The peptide transporter PEPT1, expressed in the brush border membrane of
      enterocytes, mediates the uptake of di- and tripeptides from luminal protein
      digestion in the small intestine. PEPT1 was proposed not to be expressed in
      normal colonic mucosa but may become detectable in inflammatory states such as
      Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. We reassessed colonic expression of PEPT1 
      by performing a systematic analysis of PEPT1 mRNA and protein levels in healthy
      colonic tissues in mice, rats, and humans. Immunofluorescence analysis of
      different mouse strains (C57BL/6N, 129/Sv, BALB/c) demonstrated the presence of
      PEPT1 in the distal part of the colon but not in proximal colon. Rat and human
      intestines display a similar distribution of PEPT1 as found in mice. However,
      localization in human sigmoid colon revealed immunoreactivity present at low
      levels in apical membranes but substantial staining in distinct intracellular
      compartments. Functional activity of PEPT1 in colonic tissues from mice was
      assessed in everted sac preparations using [(1)(4)C]Gly-Sar and found to be
      5.7-fold higher in distal compared with proximal colon. In intestinal tissues
      from Pept1-/- mice, no [(1)(4)C]Gly-Sar transport was detectable but feces
      samples revealed significantly higher water content than in wild-type mice,
      suggesting that PEPT1 contributes to colonic water absorption. In conclusion, our
      studies unequivocally demonstrate the presence of PEPT1 protein in healthy distal
      colonic epithelium in mice, rats, and humans and proved that the protein is
      functional and contributes to electrolyte and water handling in mice.

AB  - The pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease is still incompletely
      understood. While the development of the immune system and the establishment of
      the microflora take place during infancy young patients often have a more severe 
      and extensive disease. The differences in composition and concentration of
      intestinal microbiota and aberrant immune responses towards the luminal bacteria 
      prompted the concept of an 'ecological' approach to control the disease course.
      Probiotics, living, non pathogenic micro organisms with a beneficial effect on
      the host, and prebiotics, oligosaccharides promoting the growth of the beneficial
      microflora, have been studied to this effect. Results have so far been
      disappointing for Crohn's disease but encouraging for ulcerative colitis. An
      overview of studies using probiotics in adults or children and a perspective on
      specific pediatric issues is provided in this review.

TI  - Patient perceptions of fecal microbiota transplantation for ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1506-13
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0b013e318281f520 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), the delivery of stool from a 
      healthy prescreened donor to an individual with disease, is gaining increasing
      recognition as a potential treatment for inflammatory bowel diseases. Our
      objective was to describe patient interest in and social concerns around FMT.
      METHODS: We conducted a survey of adults with ulcerative colitis (UC) seen in
      outpatient clinic at the University of Chicago IBD Center. All English-speaking
      patients >/=18 years of age were eligible. Subjects completed a written survey in
      clinic. Ninety-five participants, median age 39 years, 53% female, were enrolled 
      in the study. RESULTS: Forty-four percent and 49% reported excellent or
      good/satisfactory medical management of their UC, respectively. Forty-six percent
      participants were willing to undergo FMT as a treatment of UC, 43% were unsure,
      and 11% were unwilling to undergo FMT. Subjects who had been hospitalized were
      more willing to undergo FMT, 54% versus 34%, P = 0.035. Primary concerns included
      the following: adequate screening for infections (41%), cleanliness (24%), and
      potential to worsen UC (18%); 21% reported no specific concerns. For donor
      selection, an equal number of participants (46%) preferred whomever their doctor 
      recommended or family member/spouse. CONCLUSIONS: In our center despite reporting
      satisfactory to excellent disease control with their treatments, the vast
      majority of patients with UC are interested in or willing to consider FMT. Proof 
      of safety and effectiveness, and failure of other medical therapies are key
      issues in considering FMT. Strong interest in this as-yet unproven therapy
      warrants attention and is a pressing priority for clinical research and
      education.

TI  - Mucosal IgG4 cell infiltration in ulcerative colitis is linked to disease
      activity and primary sclerosing cholangitis.
PG  - 1232-7
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0b013e318281344d [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The distribution of IgG4 plasma cells in colonic mucosa, its
      significance, and relation to disease activity in patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) is unclear. We systematically evaluated IgG4 cell
      distribution in colonic mucosal biopsies of patients with IBD and correlated
      histological findings with disease pattern and mucosal inflammation. METHODS: We 
      reviewed clinical records and pathology specimens of 54 randomly selected
      patients with IBD (13 Crohn's colitis: 7 active, 6 inactive; 18 ulcerative
      colitis [UC]: 10 active, 8 inactive; 23 UC with primary sclerosing cholangitis:
      11 active colitis, 12 inactive colitis), and 11 controls (3 nonspecific diarrhea,
      8 collagenous/lymphocytic colitis) who had colonoscopy and biopsies performed at 
      our institution from April 2003 to July 2010. Immunostains for IgG4 were
      performed on archived rectal biopsies. Presence of >10 IgG4 cells per high-power 
      field (x40 field) on microscopic evaluation was considered significant. RESULTS: 
      Overall, significant IgG4 plasma cell infiltration was seen in 24% of patients
      compared with none of the controls (P = 0.05). Within IBD groups, significant
      infiltration was limited to patients with UC with active colitis (30%), primary
      sclerosing cholangitis with inactive (25%) and active (64%) colitis. In contrast,
      patients with Crohn's colitis, UC with inactive colitis, and controls had rare
      IgG4 plasma cells. No correlation was observed between the number of IgG4 cells
      and degree of active inflammation. In 4 patients with UC and primary sclerosing
      cholangitis who had more than 1 colonoscopy and biopsies, the number of IgG4
      cells fluctuated without correlation with colonic disease activity. CONCLUSIONS: 
      IgG4 plasma cells are significantly increased in a subset of patients with IBD
      suggesting the possibility of a B-cell-mediated mechanism in these patients.

TI  - Altered colonic mucosal availability of n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids
      in ulcerative colitis and the relationship to disease activity.
PG  - 70-9
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2013.03.013 [doi]
LID - S1873-9946(13)00137-2 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) arachidonic acid (AA,
      n-6) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, n-3) are precursors of eicosanoids and other
      lipid mediators which have critical roles in inflammation. The mediators formed
      from the different PUFA have different potencies. We hypothesised that metabolic 
      changes associated with colonic mucosal inflammation would modify the
      bioavailability of the eicosanoid precursors AA and EPA. METHODS: Colonic mucosa 
      biopsies were obtained from patients with ulcerative colitis and from matched
      controls. Inflammation was graded endoscopically and histologically. Esterified
      and non-esterified fatty acids were determined within the biopsies using gas
      chromatography-mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry,
      respectively. RESULTS: Biopsy samples were collected from 69 UC patients (54
      providing both inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa) and 69 controls. Inflamed mucosa
      had higher AA (p<0.001) and lower EPA (p<0.010) contents and a higher AA:EPA
      ratio (p<0.001). Inflamed mucosa also had higher docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) and 
      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and lower linoleic acid (LA) and alpha-linolenic acid 
      (alpha-LNA) contents (all p<0.001), compared to non-inflamed and controls. There 
      were significant correlations between severity of inflammation and contents of
      AA, DPA and DHA (positive correlations) and of LA, alpha-LNA and EPA (negative
      correlations). CONCLUSIONS: Higher AA, AA:EPA ratio, DPA and DHA and lower LA,
      alpha-LNA and EPA are seen in inflamed mucosa in UC and correlate with severity
      of inflammation. This suggests an alteration in fatty acid metabolism in the
      inflamed gut mucosa, which may offer novel targets for intervention and should be
      considered if nutritional strategies are used.

TI  - Fasting serum concentration of short-chain fatty acids in subjects with
      microscopic colitis and celiac disease: no difference compared with controls, but
      between genders.
PG  - 696-701
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2013.786128 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), particularly propionic and butyric
      acids, have been shown to have many positive health effects. The amount and type 
      of SCFAs formed from dietary fibre by the colonic microbiota depends on the
      substrate available and is reflected in blood. The total intake and type of
      dietary fibre in people with gastrointestinal diseases differs considerably from 
      healthy subjects. OBJECTIVE: To compare fasting SCFA concentrations in subjects
      with microscopic colitis (MC), celiac disease and controls without these
      diseases. SCFAs were also analysed over 6.5 h in young healthy subjects, who had 
      eaten a fibre-rich breakfast, to identify a possible peak concentration of SCFAs 
      after a meal. METHODS: SCFAs in serum were pre-concentrated using hollow
      fibre-supported liquid membrane extraction and gas chromatography. RESULTS: The
      MC group had a higher concentration of valeric acid than the control group (p <
      0.01). No significant differences in other SCFA concentrations were seen between 
      groups, but the control group tended to have higher concentration of acetic acid 
      (p = 0.1). Furthermore, males had higher concentrations of SCFAs (with the
      exception of valeric acid) than females (p < 0.05), which were independent of
      groups. The peaks for acetic, propionic and butyric acids came approximately 5 h,
      6.5 h and 2-3 h, respectively, after breakfast. CONCLUSION: The fasting
      concentrations of SCFAs were quite similar, although the fibre intake had
      probably been quite different for a long time. The results might have been
      different if SCFAs had been recorded over a longer period.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) occurring during childhood is generally
      extensive and is associated with severe flares that may require intravenous
      steroid treatment. In cases of corticosteroid resistance is necessary to
      introduce a second-line treatment to avoid or delay surgery. AIMS: To describe
      the efficacy and safety of oral tacrolimus for the treatment of severe
      steroid-resistant UC. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study that included
      all patients under age 18 suffering from severe steroid-resistant UC treated with
      oral tacrolimus during the period January 1998 to October 2012 and with a
      follow-up period after treatment of 24 months or more. RESULTS: A total of ten
      patients were included. The age at baseline was 9.4+/-4.9 years, and the time
      from diagnosis was 1.3 months (IQR, 1-5.7). Seven of the patients were in their
      first flare of disease. All of them received an oral dose of 0.12 mg/kg/day of
      tacrolimus divided in two doses. Trough plasma levels of tacrolimus were
      maintained between 4 and 13 ng/ml. Response was seen in 5/10 patients at 12
      months, colectomy was eventually performed in 60% of patients during the
      follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Tacrolimus is useful in inducing remission in
      patients with severe steroid-resistant UC, preventing or delaying colectomy, and 
      allowing the patient and family to prepare for a probable surgery. Tacrolimus may
      also be used as a treatment bridge for corticosteroid-dependent patients until
      the new maintenance therapy takes effect.

TI  - Intraperitoneal or subcutaneous: does location of the (colo)rectal stump
      influence outcomes after laparoscopic total abdominal colectomy for ulcerative
      colitis?
PG  - 615-21
LID - 10.1097/DCR.0b013e3182707682 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The optimal management of the closed defunctionalized large-bowel
      stump after laparoscopic total abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy for
      ulcerative colitis remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to 
      compare postoperative outcomes after different techniques of management of the
      defunctionalized (colo)rectal stump. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Patients undergoing
      laparoscopic total abdominal colectomy for ulcerative colitis during 1998 to 2010
      were assigned to an intraperitoneal group (creation of Hartmann rectal stump) or 
      a subcutaneous group (subcutaneous placement of rectosigmoid stump). OUTCOME
      MEASURE: Postoperative morbidity was defined as complications occurred within 30 
      days after the operation or during the same hospital stay. RESULTS: Of 204
      patients, 99 were in the intraperitoneal group and 105 were in the subcutaneous
      group. There were no significant differences in demographics or preoperative
      data, with the exception of a significantly increased age-adjusted Charlson
      Comorbidity Index and preoperative total parental nutrition use in the
      intraperitoneal group. There was 1 postoperative death for myocardial infarction 
      in the subcutaneous group. Overall postoperative morbidity, pelvic sepsis rates, 
      and length of hospital stay were similar. Stump leaks occurred in 5 patients in
      the intraperitoneal group vs 10 patients in the subcutaneous group (p = 0.23).
      All stump leaks in the subcutaneous group only required local wound treatments
      without causing pelvic sepsis or need for reoperation. Pelvic sepsis in the
      intraperitoneal group required reoperation in 1 case, CT-guided drainage in 3,
      and antibiotics alone in 2 cases. Pelvic sepsis in the subcutaneous group
      required CT-guided drainage in 3 cases and antibiotics alone in 1 case.
      CONCLUSION: With the limitations of a retrospective study, postoperative outcomes
      were comparable after either technique of stump management, none of which could
      offset the risk of pelvic sepsis. Subcutaneous placement of colorectal stump was 
      associated with more frequent but less morbid complications.

TI  - Total colectomy for ulcerative colitis in children: when are we operating?
PG  - 689-96
LID - 10.1007/s00383-013-3307-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Ulcerative colitis (UC) in children is frequently severe and
      treatment-refractory. While medical therapy is well standardized, little is known
      regarding factors that contribute to surgical indications. Our aim was to
      identify factors associated with progression to colectomy in a large cohort of
      pediatric UC patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using
      the Pediatric Health Information System database. We identified all patients
      under age 18 discharged between January 1, 2004 and September 30, 2011 with a
      primary diagnosis of UC. Primary outcome was odds of total colectomy. RESULTS: Of
      8,688 patients, 240 (2.8 %) underwent colectomy. Compared with non-operative
      patients, a greater proportion of colectomy patients received advanced therapies 
      during admission, including corticosteroids (84.2 vs. 71.3 %) and biological
      therapy (25.4 vs. 13.6 %). Odds of colectomy were increased with malnutrition (OR
      1.86), anemia (OR 2.17), electrolyte imbalance (OR 2.31), and Clostridium
      difficile infection (OR 1.69). TPN requirement also independently predicted
      colectomy (OR 3.86). Each successive UC admission significantly increased the
      odds of colectomy (OR 1.08). CONCLUSION: These data identify factors associated
      with progression to colectomy in children hospitalized with UC. Our findings help
      to identify factors that should be incorporated into future studies aiming to
      reduce the variability in surgical treatment of childhood UC.

TI  - Nutritional intake according to injury extent in ulcerative colitis patients.
PG  - 445-51
LID - 10.1111/jhn.12064 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is often associated with nutritional
      deficiency, which appears to contribute to the progression of UC severity. The
      present study aimed to evaluate nutritional status and dietary intake in UC
      remission patients. METHODS: The present study comprised a cross-sectional study 
      in which variables such as extent of disease (distal colitis, left-sided colitis,
      pancolitis), remission period, sex and age were recorded. Extent of disease was
      assessed by the results of a colonoscopy and dietary intake was evaluated by
      using 3-day, 24-h recalls. A Kruskall-Wallis test was used to compare the intake 
      of macro- and micronutrients among the three study groups. The analysis was
      complemented by the Mann-Whitney test. A logistic regression analysis was
      performed to identify predictive factors of extent of disease (pancolitis versus 
      left-sided colitis versus distal colitis). RESULTS: The median (range) age of the
      59 patients was 49.0 (37.0-63.0) years and 53.3% were female. Twenty-six (44.1%) 
      patients had distal colitis, 11 (18.6%) patients had left-sided colitis and 22
      (37.3%) patients had pancolitis. A high probability of an inadequate intake of
      fibre (100%), fat soluble vitamins (>40% for vitamin A and >95% for vitamin E),
      vitamin C (>34%), calcium (>90%) and magnesium (>50%) was identified in the study
      group. Vitamin D intake (odds ratio = 0.60; 95% confidence interval = 0.39-0.94; 
      P < 0.05) was significantly associated with increased intestinal damage.
      CONCLUSIONS: A large number of individuals showed an inadequate intake of
      nutrients. In addition, the consumption of vitamin D was significantly associated
      with extent of disease.

TI  - Microscopic colitis in children with chronic diarrhea.
PG  - 240-4
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3182942868 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to study microscopic colitis (MC) in 
      children with special reference to its role in chronic diarrhea and changes in
      mucosal biopsies. METHODS: A total of 100 consecutive children ages 3 to 12
      years, with nonbloody diarrhea (passage of >/=3 loose stools per day) of >12
      weeks' duration were screened and 26 were enrolled in the study in which no
      specific etiology could be found and colonoscopy did not reveal any mucosal
      abnormality. Colonic biopsies were evaluated for the presence of lymphocytic
      colitis or collagenous colitis and those with the characteristic changes were
      defined to have MC (group A). Colonic biopsies from patients with MC were
      compared with biopsies from patients with chronic diarrhea but no evidence of MC 
      (group B). One hundred children ages 3 to 12 years with bleeding per rectum were 
      screened and colonic biopsies from 45 patients (group C) who had colonic mucosal 
      changes but no vascular or polyp lesion were compared with patients with MC.
      RESULTS: Of the 26 patients with chronic diarrhea, MC was found in 5 (3
      lymphocytic colitis and 2 collagenous colitis). Significantly higher
      polymorphonuclear infiltration was seen in group A as compared with group B (13.8
      [5.4-20.6] vs 7.2 [0-19.6]; P = 0.03) or group C (13.8 [5.4-20.6] vs 4 [0-13.4]; 
      P = 0.007). Intraepithelial lymphocytes (12 [4-32] vs 4 [0-24]; P = 0.008) and
      basement membrane thickening (3.5 [2.9-10.6] vs 2.5 [1.6-5.86]; P = 0.008) were
      also significantly higher in group A as compared with group C. CONCLUSIONS: MC
      was found to be present in children with nonbloody chronic diarrhea in children. 
      Further multicentric studies may provide adequate data on its prevalence.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a debilitating and widespread immune-mediated
      illness characterized by excessive inflammatory and effector mucosal responses
      leading to tissue destruction at the gastrointestinal tract. Interactions among
      the immune system, the commensal microbiota and the host genotype are thought to 
      underlie the pathogenesis of IBD. However, the precise etiology of IBD remains
      unknown. Diet-induced changes in the composition of the gut microbiome can
      modulate the induction of regulatory versus effector immune responses at the gut 
      mucosa and improve health outcomes. Therefore, manipulation of gut microbiota
      composition and the local production of microbial-derived metabolites by using
      prebiotics, probiotics and dietary fibers is being explored as a promising avenue
      of prophylactic and therapeutic intervention against gut inflammation. Prebiotics
      and fiber carbohydrates are fermented by resident microflora into short chain
      fatty acids (SCFAs) in the colon. SCFAs then activate peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma, a nuclear transcription factor with 
      widely demonstrated anti-inflammatory efficacy in experimental IBD. The
      activation of PPARgamma by naturally ocurring compounds such as conjugated
      linoleic acid, pomegranate seed oil-derived punicic acid, eleostearic acid and
      abscisic acid has been explored as nutritional interventions that suppress
      colitis by directly modulating the host immune response. The aim of this review
      is to summarize the status of innovative nutritional interventions against
      gastrointestinal inflammation, their proposed mechanisms of action, preclinical
      and clinical efficacy as well as bioinformatics and computational modeling
      approaches that accelerate discovery in nutritional and mucosal immunology
      research.

TI  - Alterations in mucosal neuropeptides in patients with irritable bowel syndrome
      and ulcerative colitis in remission: a role in pain symptom generation?
PG  - 1299-306
LID - 10.1002/j.1532-2149.2013.00309.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal
      disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain. The transient receptor
      potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel, which is involved in visceral pain
      signalling, has been shown to be up-regulated in IBS. Activation of TRPV1 leads
      to the release of neuropeptides, such as somatostatin and substance P (SP). We
      hypothesized that increased pain perception in IBS could be explained by
      increased transcription in TRPV1 and/or altered levels of neuropeptides. We
      therefore assessed the transcription of TRPV1 and the mucosal concentration of
      somatostatin and SP in IBS in comparison to healthy volunteers and patients with 
      ulcerative colitis (UC) in remission as disease controls, and to ascertain their 
      relationship to pain symptoms. METHOD: Sigmoid colonic mucosal samples were
      collected from 12 patients with IBS, 34 patients with UC in remission and 9
      healthy volunteers, in which groups TRPV1 mRNA levels were determined using
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction and neuropeptide concentrations by
      radioimmunoassay. Pain symptom intensity was determined by questionnaires.
      RESULTS: Transcription of TRPV1 as well as the concentration of neuropeptides
      were significantly higher in IBS, but only the former correlated with pain
      symptom severity. CONCLUSION: Increased transcription of TRPV1 may provide a
      possible explanation for pain generation in IBS. While the neuropeptides SP and
      somatostatin were both found to be increased in IBS, these changes are not
      sufficient to explain pain generation. Pain generation in IBS is probably
      explained by a complex redundancy in the regulation of local nociceptive
      mechanisms, which remains a subject of intensive investigation.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Oxidative stress is presumed to play an important role in
      Crohn's disease (CD) pathogenesis. Nevertheless, the evaluation of the intestinal
      antioxidant capacity through the analysis of glutathione peroxidase activity in
      CD remains to be determined. METHODS: 20 CD outpatients and 16 volunteers going
      through colonic cancer screening were enrolled. Colonoscopy with biopsies was
      performed in all individuals. Samples from inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa were 
      taken when there was CD endoscopic activity. Spectrophotometric assays were
      performed to measure tissue glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, and total
      (GSHT) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione in all samples. Demographics and clinical 
      characteristics were collected from clinical charts. RESULTS: Inflamed CD mucosa 
      presented reduced GPx activity compared to non-inflamed CD mucosa (42.94mU/mg
      protein vs 79.62mU/mg protein, P<0.05) and control mucosa (42.94mU/mg protein vs 
      95.08mU/mg protein, P<0.001). GSHT concentration was reduced in inflamed mucosa
      when compared to non-inflamed CD mucosa (0.78mumol/g vs 1.98mumol/g, P<0.01) and 
      the control group (0.78mumol/g vs 2.11mumol/g, P<0.001). A significant
      correlation was detected between GPx activity and GSSG (r=-0.599), disease
      duration (r=0.546), and thiopurine treatment (r=-0.480) in non-inflamed CD
      mucosa. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that reduced GPx activity is present in 
      inflamed CD mucosa. In addition, endoscopic activity, disease duration and
      thiopurine therapy could be associated with mucosal decreased antioxidant
      activity.

AB  - Vaginoplasty using sigmoid colon is a common technique for creation of a
      neovagina. However, special consideration must be given to potential long term
      consequences of using a colonic conduit for vaginal replacement. We report on the
      youngest described case in which a patient developed ulcerative colitis
      refractory to medical therapy with simultaneous involvement of a sigmoid
      neovagina requiring total proctocolectomy and neovaginectomy. A 17 year old XY
      female with a history of gonadal dysgenesis and sigmoid graft vaginoplasty
      presented with a history of bloody, mucoid vaginal discharge, abdominal pain,
      bloody diarrhea and weight loss. Colonic and neovaginal biopsies demonstrated
      active colitis with diffuse ulcerations, consistent with ulcerative colitis.
      Despite aggressive immunosuppressive treatment she had persistent neovaginal and 
      colonic bleeding requiring multiple transfusions, subtotal colectomy and
      ultimately completion proctectomy and neovaginectomy. It is imperative to
      recognize that colectomy alone may be an inadequate surgical intervention in
      patients with ulcerative colitis and a colonic neovaginal graft and that a
      concomitant neovaginectomy may be integral in providing appropriate treatment.

      Utilization Project Kids' Inpatient Database. RESULTS: In our primary analysis,
      we evaluated pediatric cases with a principal diagnosis of IBD or CDI. For the
      year 2009, we identified 12,610 weighted cases with IBD of which 3.5% had CDI. In
      children with IBD, CDI was independently associated with lengthier hospital stays
      (8.0 versus 6.0 days; adjusted regression coefficient, 2.1 days; 95% confidence
      interval [CI], 1.4-2.8), higher charges ($45,126 versus $34,703; adjusted
      regression coefficient, $11,506; 95% CI, 6192-16,820), and greater need for
      parenteral nutrition (15.9% versus 12.1%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.5; 95% CI,
      1.1-2.0) and blood transfusion (17.7% versus 9.8%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.8; 95% 
      CI, 1.4-2.4). There were no deaths. We made similar observations in a subanalysis
      of cases with principal or secondary diagnoses of IBD or CDI. The incidence of
      CDI in patients with IBD increased between 2000 and 2009 from 21.7 to 28.0 cases 
      per 1000 IBD cases per year (P < 0.001). There was a significant increase in CDI 
      complicating ulcerative colitis (28.1 versus 42.2, P < 0.001) but not for Crohn's
      disease (18.3 versus 20.3). CONCLUSIONS: CDI represents a significant health care
      burden in hospitalized children with IBD.

AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammation-associated disease of the colon and
      rectum. The onset and progress of the disease are directly influenced by the
      nature of the intestinal microflora, the intestinal barrier function, and the
      immunological responses of the host. The epithelial invasion of pathogenic
      bacteria due to excess contact and/or barrier dysfunction is related to
      inflammation mediated by intestinal immune responses. Although the etiology of UC
      is not clearly understood, recent studies have shown a rising incidence of UC
      worldwide, and this phenomenon is more prominent in Asian countries and in Asian 
      immigrants in Western countries. The increased prevalence of UC also contributes 
      to an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer. Environmental factors,
      including changes in dietary habits, have been suggested as major risk factors of
      UC. A systematic review showed a negative association between UC risk and
      vegetable intake, whereas total fat, omega-6 fatty acids and meat intake were
      positively associated with an increased risk of UC. Individual dietary factors
      and energy balance have been suggested as having important roles in inducing
      changes in the microbial population and intestinal barrier integrity and in
      regulating inflammatory immune responses, directly or indirectly. Excess energy
      intake is now known to increase pathogenic microbial populations. Likewise, the
      application of appropriate probiotics may reverse the pathogenic progression of
      the disease. In the meantime, dietary anti-inflammatory compounds, including
      omega-3 fatty acids and other phytochemicals, may directly suppress inflammatory 
      responses in the course of UC development. In this review, the increased
      prevalence of UC and its management are interpreted from the standpoint of
      nutritional modulation to regulate the intestinal microflora population,
      intestinal epithelium permeability, and inflammatory responses.

TI  - Rates and predictors of oral medication adherence in pediatric patients with IBD.
PG  - 832-9
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0b013e3182802b57 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) include bloody diarrhea,
      fatigue, abdominal pain, and weight loss. Long-term management of remission for
      most patients requires adherence to taking 1 or more oral medications daily, in
      the absence of symptoms. We investigated whether disease characteristics and
      behavioral characteristics predict adherence to prescribed medical regimens.
      METHODS: : Patients aged 8 to 17.5 years, newly diagnosed with IBD, and a matched
      cohort previously diagnosed were studied over a 6-month period. Adherence was
      assessed using medication electronic monitoring devices (Medication Event
      Monitoring Systems); participants and parents completed questionnaires regarding 
      emotional and behavioral functioning, and biological parameters were monitored.
      RESULTS: : Adherence was monitored for 45 newly and 34 previously diagnosed
      patients. In total, 16,478 patient-days (including 12,066 discrete days) were
      electronically monitored. Overall, 70.6% of 5-aminosalicylic acid and 65.4% of
      6-mercaptopurine doses were taken. Only 25% and 15% of older adolescents took at 
      least 80% of their 5-aminosalicylic acid and 6-mercaptopurine, respectively,
      compared with about 83% and 64% of 8-year-olds to 11-year-olds. Only age and
      behavioral issues were statistically linked to rates of adherence. CONCLUSIONS:
      Adherence to commonly prescribed oral medications for IBD is challenging for
      patients. Screening for emotional and behavioral problems, especially among older
      adolescents, would be important in identifying patients at risk of poor
      adherence, who might benefit from interventions. Biological solutions, although
      critical, when applied without attention to behavioral issues, are not likely to 
      provide the level of therapeutic benefit that can be provided in a combined
      biobehavioral approach.

TI  - Teduglutide enhances structural adaptation of the small intestinal mucosa in
      patients with short bowel syndrome.
PG  - 602-7
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0b013e3182828f57 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intestinotrophic therapies, such as glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2)
      analogs, may enhance intestinal adaptation and reduce dependence on parenteral
      nutrition (PN) in patients with intestinal failure associated with short bowel
      syndrome (SBS-IF). However, because GLP-2 enhances cellular growth, there is
      concern that GLP-2 analogs may also encourage growth of malignant cells. AIMS: To
      histologically examine the effects of teduglutide, a recombinant human GLP-2
      analog, on the mucosa of the small and large intestine for indications of
      dysplastic transformation. METHODS: In a multicenter, prospective, randomized,
      placebo-controlled study, 83 PN-dependent patients with SBS-IF were monitored for
      several weeks to ensure optimal and stable PN. Patients were then randomized to
      receive 24 weeks of placebo (n=16), teduglutide (0.5 mg/kg/d; n=35), or
      teduglutide (0.10 mg/kg/d; n=32). RESULTS: Biopsies were obtained from 77
      patients to yield 390 individual histologic interpretations. After 6 months of
      treatment, no features of dysplasia were found in any biopsy from the large or
      small intestine of patients receiving placebo or either dose of teduglutide. New 
      secondary diagnoses, such as eosinophilic colitis or Crohn's disease, were found 
      at a low frequency overall: teduglutide (0.05 mg/kg/d; range, 3.1% to 6.3%);
      teduglutide (0.10 mg/kg/d, 3.3%); placebo (range, 6.7% to 13.3%). CONCLUSIONS:
      Although this histologic substudy of biopsy samples was not powered to detect
      differences in occurrence of dysplasia between teduglutide-treated patients and
      those randomized to placebo, it demonstrated that no dysplasia or other
      pathologic processes were evident within the intestinal mucosa in the placebo
      group or the 2 teduglutide groups after 6 months of treatment.

PG  - 285-9
LID - 10.1007/s00063-012-0195-x [doi]
AB  - From a gastroenterological point of view, for chronic critically ill patients a
      differentiation has to be made between general gastroenterological problems,
      which are important in many or all chronic critically ill patients and patients
      with gastroenterological diseases which are the reason for the chronic critically
      ill status. General gastroenterological problems are, for example the nutrition
      of these patients and also considerations about ulcer prophylaxis or
      gastroenterological complications, such as antibiotic-associated colitis.
      Gastroenterological diseases as the reason for a chronic critically ill status
      are more in the minority. Diseases which should be taken into consideration are
      advanced liver cirrhosis and short bowel syndrome. This manuscript is intended to
      discuss gastroenterological problems in this selected group of patients and to
      show possible solutions and treatment options.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cryptosporidiosis is usually a self-limiting illness in
      healthy patients. However, it can cause severe life threatening complications in 
      immunocompromised patients. The effect of cryptosporidial infection on
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has not been well studied and available
      literature is largely restricted to adult case reports. The purpose of this study
      is to describe the clinical characteristics of cryptosporidial infection in
      children with IBD. METHODS: Stool studies from children with IBD presenting with 
      presumed relapse during the period 2005-2011 were reviewed retrospectively.
      Cryptosporidial infection was diagnosed by stool enzyme immunoassay. An age
      matched control group of IBD patients without cryptosporidial infection was used 
      for comparison. RESULTS: Medical records of 170 IBD patients were reviewed and a 
      total of 149 presumed relapses were identified. Cryptosporidial infection was
      found in seven of the 39 patients with positive stool studies (four ulcerative
      colitis/three Crohn's disease) presenting with relapse. The median age was 13
      years (range: 3-17) and five patients were female. The median duration of the IBD
      was 18 months (range 2-48 months). All but one patient had stable disease prior
      to acquiring infection. Five patients required hospitalization due to significant
      dehydration. Three of the five patients treated with nitazoxanide had significant
      clinical improvement in 3 days. All patients had complete resolution of symptoms 
      by three weeks and no infection related complications were noted. In comparison
      to patients with cryptosporidial infection, the control group required an
      increased need for escalation of therapy (71% vs. 0.0%, p=001) and higher
      re-hospitalization rates (24% Vs.0.0%, p=0.54) within 6 months following indexed 
      relapse. CONCLUSION: In IBD patients, cryptosporidiosis can cause significant
      illness leading to increased need for hospitalization. In the absence of
      appropriate stool studies, cryptosporidiosis can be misdiagnosed as disease
      relapse and lead to inappropriate therapy. Nitazoxanide appears to be effective
      along with supportive therapy.

TI  - Gene signature distinguishes patients with chronic ulcerative colitis harboring
      remote neoplastic lesions.
PG  - 461-70
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0b013e3182802bac [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals with ulcerative colitis (UC) are at increased risk for
      colorectal cancer. The standard method of surveillance for neoplasia in UC by
      colonoscopy is invasive and can miss flat lesions. We sought to identify a gene
      expression signature in nondysplastic mucosa without active inflammation that
      could serve as a marker for remote neoplastic lesions. METHODS: Gene expression
      was analyzed by complementary DNA microarray in 5 normal controls, 4 UC patients 
      without dysplasia, and 11 UC patients harboring remote neoplasia. Common gene
      ontology pathways of significantly differentially expressed genes were
      identified. Expression of genes which were progressively and significantly
      upregulated from controls to UC without neoplasia, to UC with remote neoplasia
      were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Several gene products were
      also examined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Four hundred and sixty-eight
      genes were significantly upregulated, and 541 genes were significantly
      downregulated in UC patients with neoplasia compared with UC patients without
      neoplasia. Nine genes (ACSL1, BIRC3, CLC, CREM, ELTD1, FGG, S100A9, THBD, and
      TPD52L1) were progressively and significantly upregulated from controls to
      nondysplastic UC to UC with neoplasia. Immunostaining of proteins revealed
      increased expression of S100A9 and REG1alpha in UC-associated cancer and in
      nondysplastic tissue from UC patients harboring remote neoplasia compared with UC
      patients without neoplasia and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Gene expression changes
      occurring as a field effect in the distal colon of patients with chronic UC
      identify patients harboring remote neoplastic lesions. These markers may lead to 
      a more accurate and less invasive method of detection of neoplasia in patients
      with inflammatory bowel disease.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Diet is known to have a major role in the expression of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The role of dietary interventions and enteral
      nutrition in the management of IBD remains unelucidated. This study was to review
      the current evidence for dietary risk factors for the development of IBD and the 
      efficacies of dietary and enteral interventions. RECENT FINDINGS: High dietary
      intakes of total fats, polyunsaturated fatty acids, omega-6 fatty acids, and meat
      are associated with an increased risk of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. 
      Further prospective studies are required to confirm these observations. Among
      various dietary interventions, none has shown striking efficacy. Meta-analyses
      have shown enteral nutrition to be inferior to corticosteroids in adults with
      active Crohn's disease. However, in children, a meta-analysis has shown no
      significant difference in the remission rates between enteral nutrition and
      corticosteroid therapy. Although the evidence level is not striking, enteral
      nutrition may be useful for maintaining remission in patients with quiescent
      Crohn's disease. SUMMARY: Dietary risk factors for IBD and the therapeutic
      benefit of dietary and enteral interventions need to be confirmed by further well
      designed studies in large cohorts of patients.

AB  - Vitamin Ks (VKs) are fat-soluble quinone compounds known to have various
      bioactivities. This review describes the inflammatory effects of VKs and their
      related quinone derivatives based on DNA polymerase (pol) inhibition. VK3, but
      not VK1 or VK2 (=MK-4), inhibited the activity of human pol gamma, which is the
      DNA replicative pol in mitochondria. Of the intermediate compounds between VK2
      and VK3 (namely MK-3, MK-2 and MK-1), MK-2 was the strongest inhibitor of
      mammalian pols alpha, kappa and lambda, which belong to the B-, Y- and X-families
      of pols, respectively. Among the VK3 based quinone derivatives, such as
      1,4-naphthoquinone (NQ), 2-dimethyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (1,2-dimethyl-NQ),
      1,4-benzoquinone (BQ), 9,10-anthraquinone (AQ) and 5,12-naphthacenequinone (NCQ),
      NQ was the strongest inhibitor of mammalian pols alpha and lambda, in particular,
      DNA repair-related pol lambda. Among the all compounds tested, NQ displayed the
      strongest suppression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha production induced by 
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in a cell culture system using RAW264.7 mouse
      macrophages. NQ also suppressed the expression of pol lambda protein in these
      cells, after LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells were stimulated to induce pol lambda
      expression. In an in vivo mouse model of LPS-evoked acute inflammation,
      intraperitoneal injection of NQ into mice suppressed TNF-alpha production in
      peritoneal macrophages and serum. In an in vivo colitis mouse model induced using
      dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), NQ markedly suppressed DSS-evoked colitis. The
      promising anti-inflammatory candidates based on the inhibition of DNA
      repair-related pols, such as pol lambda, by VKs quinone derivatives, such as NQ, 
      are discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To assess the reliability and validity of IMPACT-III (HR), a
      disease-specific, health-related quality of life instrument in Croatian children 
      with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: In a multicenter study, 104 children
      participated in a validation study of IMPACT-III (HR) cross-culturally adapted
      for Croatia. Factor analysis was used to determine optimal domain structure for
      this cohort, analysis of Cronbach's alpha coefficients to test internal
      reliability, ANOVA to assess discriminant validity, and correlation with
      Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, Version 4.0 (PedsQL) using Pearson
      correlation coefficients to assess concurrent validity. RESULTS: Cronbach's alpha
      for the IMPACT-III (HR) total score was 0.92. The most robust factor solution was
      a 5-domain structure: Symptoms, Concerns, Socializing, Body Image, and Worry
      about Stool, all of which demonstrated good internal reliability
      (alpha=0.60-0.89), but two items were dropped to achieve this. Discriminant
      validity was demonstrated by significant differences (P<0.001) in mean IMPACT-III
      (HR) scores between quiescent and mild or moderate-severe disease activity groups
      for total (148 vs. 139 or 125) and following factor scores: Symptoms (84 vs. 71
      or 61), Socializing (91 vs. 83 or 76), and Worry about Stool (significant only
      between quiescent and moderate-severe groups, 90 vs. 62, respectively).
      Concurrent validity of IMPACT-III (HR) with PedsQL showed significant
      correlation, which was strongest when similar domains were compared. CONCLUSION: 
      IMPACT-III (HR) appears to be useful tool to measure health-related quality of
      life in Croatian children with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

LID - 10.1038/ajg.2012.453 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Obesity is associated with a proinflammatory state that may be
      involved in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), for which there are
      plausible biological mechanisms. Our aim was to perform the first prospective
      cohort study investigating if there is an association between obesity and the
      development of incident IBD. METHODS: A total of 300,724 participants were
      recruited into the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition
      study. At recruitment, anthropometric measurements of height and weight plus
      physical activity and total energy intake from validated questionnaires were
      recorded. The cohort was monitored identifying participants who developed either 
      Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). Each case was matched with four 
      controls and conditional logistic regression used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) 
      for body mass index (BMI) adjusted for smoking, energy intake, and physical
      activity. RESULTS: In the cohort, 177 participants developed incident UC and 75
      participants developed incident CD. There were no associations with the four
      higher categories of BMI compared with a normal BMI for UC (Ptrend=0.36) or CD
      (Ptrend=0.83). The lack of associations was consistent when BMI was analyzed as a
      continuous or binary variable (BMI 18.5<25.0 vs. >/=25 kg/m(2)). Physical
      activity and total energy intake, factors that influence BMI, did not show any
      association with UC (physical activity, Ptrend=0.79; total energy intake,
      Ptrend=0.18) or CD (physical activity, Ptrend=0.42; total energy, Ptrend=0.11).
      CONCLUSIONS: Obesity as measured by BMI is not associated with the development of
      incident UC or CD. Alternative measures of obesity are required to further
      investigate the role of obesity in the development of incident IBD.

      expression of claudin-2 and Th2-inducing cytokines.
PG  - 1849-58
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1201373 [doi]
AB  - Patients suffering from ulcerative colitis (UC) exhibit chronic colonic
      inflammation caused by a dysregulated mucosal immune response and epithelial
      barrier disruption. Th2 cytokines, including IL-13, have been implicated in the
      pathogenesis of UC. IL-13 induces phosphorylation of STAT6, and we previously
      demonstrated increased epithelial p-STAT6 in children with UC. In this study, we 
      investigated the role of STAT6 in oxazolone colitis, a murine model of UC, by
      inducing colitis in STAT6-deficient (STAT6(-/-)) and wild type (WT) mice. We
      observed increased epithelial cell, T cell, macrophage, and NKT cell STAT6
      phosphorylation, as well as increased p-STAT6(+) IL-13-producing NKT cells, in
      colitic WT mice. Colitis was attenuated in STAT6(-/-) mice, with improvements in 
      weight, colon length, and histopathology. There was decreased induction of the
      pore-forming tight junction protein claudin-2 in STAT6(-/-) mice. Similarly,
      short hairpin RNA STAT6 knockdown reduced claudin-2 induction and transepithelial
      resistance decrease in IL-13-treated human T84 cells. Tissue expression of IL-13,
      IFN-gamma, IL-17, and IL-10 mRNA was similarly induced in WT and STAT6(-/-)
      colitic mice; however, we observed increased mRNA expression for the Th2-inducing
      cytokines IL-33 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin in WT mice with colitis, which
      was abrogated in STAT6(-/-) mice. Mesenteric lymph node cells from STAT6(-/-)
      mice with colitis exhibited reduced secretion of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and
      IFN-gamma. IL-33 augmented mesenteric lymph node cell secretion of IL-5, IL-13,
      IL-6, and IFN-gamma. These data implicate STAT6 in the pathogenesis of colitis in
      vivo with important roles in altering epithelial barrier function and regulating 
      Th2-inducing cytokine production.

TI  - Role of thiopurine metabolite testing and thiopurine methyltransferase
      determination in pediatric IBD.
PG  - 333-40
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3182844705 [doi]
AB  - Thiopurines have been used in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) for >30 years, and
      measurements of both thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) and thiopurine (TP)
      metabolites, 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN) and 6-methylmercaptopurine
      (6-MMP), have been readily available. The North American Society for Pediatric
      Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) Committee on Inflammatory 
      Bowel Disease thought it appropriate to review the present indications for use of
      TPMT and TP metabolite testing. Substantial evidence demonstrates that TP therapy
      is useful for both Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis. Review of the existing
      data yielded the following recommendations. TPMT testing is recommended before
      initiation of TPs to identify individuals who are homozygote recessive or have
      extremely low TPMT activity, with the latter having more reliability than the
      former. Individuals who are homozygous recessive or have extremely low TPMT
      activity should avoid the use of TPs because of concerns for significant
      leukopenia. TMPT testing does not predict all cases of leukopenia and has no
      value to predict hypersensitivity adverse effects such as pancreatitis. Any
      potential value to reduce the risk of malignancy has not been studied. All
      individuals taking TPs should have routine monitoring with complete blood cell
      count and white blood cell count differential to evaluate for leukopenia
      regardless of TPMT testing results. Metabolite testing can be used to determine
      adherence with TP therapy. Metabolite testing can be used to guide dose increases
      or modifications in patients with active disease. Consideration would include
      either increasing the dose, changing therapy or for those with elevated
      transaminases or an elevated 6-MMP, using adjunctive allopurinol to help raise
      6-thioguanine metabolites and suppress formation of 6-MMP. Routine and repetitive
      metabolite testing has little or no role in patients who are doing well and
      taking an acceptable dose of a TP.

      disease.
PG  - 184-9
LID - 10.1097/MOG.0b013e32835d7bba [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is direct evidence that the pathogenesis of inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) involves the gastrointestinal microbiota and some evidence
      that the microbiota might also play a similar role in irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS). The aim of this article is to review the emerging evidence for the
      mechanisms and effectiveness of probiotics in the management of these disorders. 
      RECENT FINDINGS: The composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota is strongly
      influenced by factors including age, diet and disease. Probiotics may be
      effective through their impact on the host gastrointestinal microbiota and
      promotion of mucosal immunoregulation. Probiotics are considered to be well
      tolerated, although the quality of studies and health claims has been variable.
      There are many short-term studies demonstrating the effectiveness of probiotics
      in IBS, although recommendations should be made for specific strains and for
      specific symptoms. Within IBD, a number of trials have shown the benefits of a
      range of probiotics in pouchitis and in ulcerative colitis, although current
      evidence in Crohn's disease is less promising. SUMMARY: Clearly, some probiotics 
      have considerable potential in the management of IBS and IBD; however, the
      benefits are strain specific. High-quality trials of probiotics in
      gastrointestinal disorders as well as laboratory investigations of their
      mechanism of action are required in order to understand who responds and why.

AB  - Acute diarrhea is defined as an abnormally frequent discharge of semisolid or
      fluid fecal matter from the bowel, lasting less than 14 days. More than three
      millions cases of acute diarrhea, presumably due to intestinal infections, are
      seen in general practice every year in France. Most of the cases are benign and
      resolve under symptomatic treatment within 3 days, without need for biological
      tests or antibiotics. In special contexts (septicemic syndrome, visible blood in 
      stools, severe dehydration, patients at risk of severe sepsis [valvulopathy]),
      biologic tests and probabilist antibiotic treatment are required. Hygiene,
      rehydration and diet recommendations are always part of the treatment of acute
      diarrhea, in addition to the symptomatic treatment of diarrhea and other
      digestive symptoms. Antibiotic-associated diarrhea is clinically benign in most
      cases, and attributed to transient dysbiosis of gut microbiota. In the remaining 
      cases, diarrhea is the clinical expression of intestinal infection by Clostridium
      difficile, that should be treated with metronidazole, or the clinical expression 
      of a Klebsiella oxytoca-associated colitis that usually spontaneously resolves
      after stopping antibiotics.

PG  - 485-91
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3182801e43 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have an increased risk
      of venous thrombotic events (TEs). We sought to evaluate the risk for TE in
      children and adolescents with IBD using a large population database. METHODS: The
      triennial Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Kids' Inpatient Database was
      used in a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized children in the United
      States across 1997, 2000, 2003, 2006, and 2009. Billing codes were used to
      identify discharges with Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, pulmonary embolism,
      deep vein thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, thrombosis of intracranial venous sinus, 
      Budd-Chiari syndrome, and portal vein thrombosis. A logistic regression model was
      fitted to quantify the increased risk of TE in children with IBD, while adjusting
      for other risk factors of thrombosis. RESULTS: The total weighted number of
      pediatric discharges was 7,448,292, and 68,394 (0.92%) were identified with IBD. 
      The incidence of any TE in a hospitalized child or adolescent with IBD was
      117.9/10,000 with a relative risk (95% confidence interval) of 2.36 (2.15-2.58). 
      The adjusted odds ratio for any TE in a patient with IBD without surgery was 1.22
      (1.08-1.36). Risk factors for TE among patients with IBD include older age,
      central venous catheter, parenteral nutrition, and an identified hypercoagulable 
      condition. There is an increasing trend of TE in both the IBD and non-IBD
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized children and adolescents with IBD are at
      increased risk for TE. Conservative methods of TE prevention including hydration,

TI  - You look all right to me: compromised nutritional status in paediatric patients
      with ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 385-9
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e31827e1f25 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: It is reported that malnutrition is not a feature of ulcerative
      colitis (UC). Body mass index (BMI) is frequently used clinically to indicate
      nutritional status; however, it is a proxy measure at best, and body cell mass
      (BCM) is a much more accurate representation. The present study aims to
      investigate BMI in patients with UC in relation to their BCM. METHODS: A total of
      18 patients (7M; 11F) had their nutritional status (BCM) measured using total
      body potassium(4)(0) counting every 6 months to yield a total of 77 measurements.
      BCM measurements were adjusted for height and sex, and BMI was calculated as
      weight/height(2), with z scores determined for both parameters. Disease activity 
      was determined using the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index. RESULTS:
      Mean (+/-SD) height, weight, BMI, and BCM z scores were 0.39 (0.96), 0.20 (1.08),
      -0.05 (1.18), and -0.74 (1.41), respectively. No correlation was found between
      BMI and BCM z scores, and these z scores were significantly different (P=0.02),
      particularly in the moderate/severe disease activity group (P=0.01). Mean BCM z
      scores were -0.69 (1.65) of a z score below BMI z scores. Furthermore, where BMI 
      z scores showed no relation to disease activity and no differences between
      disease activity categories, BCM z scores were significantly negatively
      correlated (r=-0.32, P=0.01), with significantly lower scores found in the
      moderate/severe group (P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Simply calculating BMI in patients
      with UC does not give adequate information regarding nutritional status, and more
      accurate, yet easily accessible "bedside" techniques need to be determined to
      improve patient care.

AB  - The cytokine IL-1 is critical to the pathogenesis of a variety of human
      conditions and diseases. Unlike most other cytokines, IL-1 is counterbalanced by 
      two endogenous inhibitors. The functional significance of IL-1 receptor
      antagonist (IL-1RA) is well documented due to the clinical utilization of the
      recombinant human IL-1RA analog, anakinra. In contrast, much less is known about 
      the type 2 IL-1 receptor (IL-1R2), which acts as a decoy receptor for IL-1. While
      IL-1R2 is structurally similar to the type 1 IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1) responsible
      for IL-1 signal transduction, its truncated cytoplasmic domain and lack of
      Toll-IL-1 receptor (TIR) region renders IL-1R2 incapable of transmembrane
      signaling. IL-1R2 competes with IL-1R1 for ligands and for the IL-1R1
      co-receptor, IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAP). Additionally, IL-1R2
      exists in both a membrane bound and soluble form (sIL-1R2) that has biological
      properties similar to both a decoy receptor and a binding protein. Thus far,
      IL-1R2 has been implicated in arthritis, endometriosis, organ transplantation,
      sepsis/sickness behavior, diabetes, atherosclerosis, autoimmune inner ear disease
      (AIED), Alzheimer's disease and ulcerative colitis. In this review, we will
      detail the functional properties of IL-1R2 and examine its role in human disease.

TI  - Lack of preoperative enteral nutrition reduces gut-associated lymphoid cell
      numbers in colon cancer patients: a possible mechanism underlying increased
      postoperative infectious complications during parenteral nutrition.
PG  - 1059-64
LID - 10.1097/SLA.0b013e31827a0e05 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine preoperative dietary influences on gut-associated lymphoid 
      tissue (GALT) cell number in the context of postoperative infectious
      complications. BACKGROUND: There is little clinical evidence regarding whether
      nutritional routes affect GALT size and/or phenotype. The influence of GALT
      atrophy on clinical outcomes is also unclear. METHOD: Patients with complete
      obstruction of the colon due to a tumor were excluded from this study. Study 1.
      Resected terminal ileum specimens, from 62 patients [preoperative parenteral
      nutrition (PN): n = 15, preoperative oral feeding (OF): n = 47] who underwent
      right colectomy during the period from 1997 to 2004 at our department, were
      immunohistochemically stained for counting numbers of T, IgA-producing, and
      mature and immature dendritic cells (DCs) in the lamina propria (LP) and
      intraepithelial space.Study 2. We reviewed 341 patients (PN: n = 99, OF: n = 242)
      with colon cancer who underwent colectomy during this period for postoperative
      complications. RESULTS: Study 1. T cell numbers in the LP and intraepithelial
      space and IgA-producing cell number in the LP were significantly lower in the PN 
      than in the OF group. Mature DC number in the LP was significantly lower in the
      PN than in the OF group, whereas total DC numbers (both mature and immature DC)
      were similar in the 2 groups.Study 2. The PN group had significantly higher rates
      of total infectious complications, surgical site infection, pneumonia, infectious
      colitis, and central venous catheter infection. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of enteral
      delivery of nutrients reduces numbers of T and IgA-producing cells, as well as
      mature DCs, in GALT of colon cancer patients, as it does in animal models. A
      close association between GALT changes and infectious complication morbidity was 
      confirmed.

AB  - Primary duodenal localization of Crohn's disease (CD) is rare. Medical therapy
      can control symptoms, but surgery is required when progressive obstructive
      symptoms occur. Surgical options include bypass, resection, or strictureplasty,
      but it is still not clear which should be the treatment of choice. Reviewing the 
      medical records of 1253 patients undergoing surgery for CD between January 1986
      and December 2011 at the Digestive Surgery Unit of the Department of Clinical
      Physiopathology of the University of Florence, 10 patients (6 males and 4
      females) underwent operations for duodenal CD. Four patients had only a duodenal 
      localization, 6 patients had synchronous involvement of other intestinal tracts. 
      Strictures were distributed in all the duodenal portions: in 7 patients there
      were single lesions, in 3 patients there were multiple lesions. Eight patients
      were treated with strictureplasty: 5 with the Heineke-Mikulicz technique, 2 with 
      Jaboulay, and 1 with a pedunculated jejunal patch. Two patients were treated with
      resection: one with a B2 gastro-duodenal resection, and 1 with a duodenal-jejunal
      resection and an end to side duodeno-jejunal anastomosis. Follow up of the
      patients was from 2 to 18 years. No recurrence of duodenal CD was observed in the
      2 patients treated with resection, while 2 of the 8 patients treated with
      strictureplasty had a recurrence. In our experience, strictureplasty is indicated
      when less than 2 strictures are present in the 2nd or 3rd duodenal portion. In
      cases with multiple strictures localized in the 1st or the distal duodenal
      portion, resection is preferable.

LID - 10.4161/gmic.22822 [doi]
AB  - Pathogenic autoinflammatory responses triggered by dysregulated microbial
      interactions may lead to intestinal disorders and malignancies. Previously, we
      demonstrated that a lipoteichoic acid (LTA)-deficient Lactobacillus acidophilus
      strain, NCK2025, ameliorated inflammation-induced colitis, significantly reduced 
      the number of polyps in a colonic polyposis cancer model and restored
      physiological homeostasis in both cases. Nonetheless, the regulatory signals
      delivered by NCK2025 to reprogram the gastrointestinal microenvironment, and thus
      resist colonic cancer progression, remain unknown. Accumulating evidence suggest 
      that epigenetic changes, in the presence and absence of pathogenic inflammation, 
      can result in colorectal cancer (CRC). To test possible epigenetic modifications 
      induced by NCK2025, the expression of epigenetically regulated, CRC-associated
      genes was measured with and without bacterial treatment. In vivo and in vitro,
      NCK2025 enhanced the expression of tumor suppressor genes that may regulate CRC
      development. Therefore, differential epigenetic regulation of CRC-related genes
      by NCK2025 represents a potential therapy against colitis-associated and sporadic
      CRC.

      elderly patients with IBD in four countries using health administrative data.
      METHODS: Databases from the United States (US), United Kingdom (UK), Denmark and 
      Canada were queried. Variation in prescription rates between countries was
      assessed in patients >/=65y with prevalent IBD who had >/=1 prescription for an
      IBD-related medication in a given quarter between 2004 and 2009. Patients were
      identified using previously-reported, validated algorithms. Country-specific
      rates were compared in each quarter using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: In
      patients with Crohn's disease, Canada and US had higher prescription rates for
      oral 5-ASA (P<0.0001 in all quarters) and infliximab (P<0.05 in 22/24 quarters), 
      while the US had higher rates of thiopurine usage (P<0.05 in 23/24 quarters).
      Canada had greater rates of methotrexate prescriptions (P<0.05 in 21/24 quarters 
      analyzed). In patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), rates of oral steroid usage 
      was lowest in the US (P<0.05 in 22/24 quarters) and oral 5-ASA use was highest in
      the US and Canada (P<0.0001 in all quarters). Canada and Denmark used more rectal
      therapy than the US. Infliximab usage in UC was significantly higher in the US
      and Canada after 2006. CONCLUSIONS: Significant variation in medication
      prescription rates exists among countries. Future research should assess whether 
      these differences were associated with disparities in outcomes and health care
      costs.

AB  - The essential micronutrient zinc has long been known to be a functional component
      of diverse structural proteins and enzymes. More recently, important roles for
      free or loosely bound intracellular zinc as a signaling factor have been
      reported. Insufficient zinc intake was shown to exacerbate symptoms in mouse
      models of inflammation such as experimental colitis, while zinc supplementation
      was found to improve intestinal barrier function. Herein, we provide evidence
      that intracellular zinc is essential for maintaining intestinal epithelial
      integrity when cells are exposed to the inflammatory cytokine Tumor Necrosis
      Factor (TNF)alpha. Using the human intestinal Caco-2/TC7 cell line as an in vitro
      model, we demonstrate that depletion of intracellular zinc affects
      TNFalpha-triggered signaling by shifting intestinal cell fate from survival to
      death. The mechanism underlying this effect was investigated. We show that
      TNFalpha promotes a zinc-dependent survival pathway that includes modulation of
      gene expression of transcription factors and signaling proteins. We have
      identified multiple regulatory steps regulated by zinc availability which include
      the induction of cellular Inhibitor of APoptosis (cIAP2) mRNA, possibly through
      activation of Nuclear Factor-Kappa B (NF-kappaB), as both nuclear translocation
      of the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB and up-regulation of cIAP2 mRNA were impaired
      following zinc depletion. Moreover, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein level
      was profoundly reduced by zinc depletion. Our results provide a possible
      molecular explanation for the clinical observation that zinc supplements
      ameliorate Crohn's disease symptoms and decrease intestinal permeability in
      experimental colitis.

TI  - Health-related quality of life in pediatric ulcerative colitis patients on
      conventional medical treatment compared to those after restorative
      proctocolectomy.
PG  - 325-33
LID - 10.1007/s00384-012-1561-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Health-related quality of life (HRQL) is not well studied in
      proctocolectomy patients with pediatric onset of ulcerative colitis (UC). We
      aimed to (1) compare the HRQL of proctocolectomy patients with those treated with
      conventional therapy and (2) determine factors that influence HRQL in UC patients
      < 18 years. METHODS: Chart review was done on patients diagnosed with pediatric
      onset of UC (<18) at the Stollery Children's Hospital. HRQL was evaluated in 88
      patients using disease- and age-specific questionnaires; IMPACT III (<18) and
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ; >/=18). Demographics, disease
      characteristics, disease index (PUCAI), HRQL EuroQoL visual analog scale
      (EQ-5D/VAS) were collected and analyzed from all patients. RESULTS: Sixty-five
      respondents completed the IMPACT III (74 %) and 23 patients completed the IBDQ
      (26 %). Thirty-three surgical patients (34 %) responded (mean IMPACT III score = 
      148.9 +/- 12.7; mean IBDQ = 171.2 +/- 40.1). There was no significant difference 
      in IMPACT III scores of surgical patients vs. medically treated patients (148.9
      +/- 12.7 vs. 140.6 +/- 19.4, p = 0.09). Patients with high IMPACT scores (>143
      points) were most likely to be in remission (p = 0.05), they were less likely to 
      be on medication (p < 0.05), have parent/guardian with postsecondary education (p
      = 0.01), did not suffer from fatigue (p < 0.01), and did not report depression (p
      < 0.02). The IMPACT correlation with PUCAI (adjusted r (2) = 0.33) and EQ-VAS
      (adjusted r (2) = 0.45) was strong. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical patients reported to
      have a HRQL comparable to or better than the nonsurgical patients. Depression,
      fatigue, parent/guardian education, and drugs influence HRQL.

TI  - Recurrent blood eosinophilia in ulcerative colitis is associated with severe
      disease and primary sclerosing cholangitis.
PG  - 222-8
LID - 10.1007/s10620-012-2329-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Eosinophils are implicated in the pathogenesis of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A subset of IBD patients develops blood
      eosinophilia, and the clinical profile of these patients is undefined. We sought 
      to characterize IBD patients with and without eosinophilia. METHODS: We studied a
      prospective registry of 1,176 IBD patients followed in a tertiary referral
      center. Patients who developed eosinophilia at any time were identified by
      electronic medical record query. We performed a chart review case-control study
      comparing patients with recurrent eosinophilia versus randomly selected
      disease-matched patients with no history of eosinophilia. Histological analysis
      was performed on selected cases and controls. RESULTS: Eosinophilia at any time
      was more prevalent in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients than Crohn's disease
      patients (22.2 versus 12.7%), as was recurrent eosinophilia (3.4 versus 0.7%). UC
      patients with recurrent eosinophilia were predominantly male compared with the
      control UC population (81.3 versus 46.9%) and had higher rates of colectomy for
      either medically refractory disease or dysplasia/cancer than control UC patients 
      (56.3 versus 15.6%). Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) occurred in 37.5% of UC
      patients with recurrent eosinophilia compared with only 3.1% in the UC controls. 
      Histological analysis of random diagnostic samples from UC patients with
      recurrent eosinophilia demonstrated a normal eosinophil pattern as seen in the
      control UC population. CONCLUSIONS: Eosinophilia-associated UC is a subgroup of
      IBD associated with severe colitis and PSC. Further studies are warranted to
      characterize molecular mechanisms underlying eosinophilia-associated UC and to
      determine optimal approaches for therapy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and anti-Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae mannan antibodies (ASCAs) have been detected in the serum of patients 
      with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) and their unaffected family
      members. The aim of this study was to establish the value of serological markers 
      as predictors of UC and CD. DESIGN: Individuals who developed CD or UC were
      identified from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition 
      (EPIC) study. At recruitment, none of the participants had a diagnosis of CD or
      UC. For each incident case, two controls were randomly selected matched for
      centre, date of birth, sex, date of recruitment and time of follow-up. Serum of
      cases and controls obtained at recruitment were analysed for ASCA IgG, ASCA IgA, 
      perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA), antibodies against
      Escherichia coli outer membrane porin C (OmpC) and flagellin CBir1. Conditional
      logistic regression was used to determine risk of CD and UC. Receiver operating
      characteristic curves were constructed to test accuracy. RESULTS: A total of 77
      individuals were diagnosed with CD and 167 with UC after a mean follow-up of 4.5 
      (SD 3.2) and 4.4 (SD 3.1) years following blood collection, respectively.
      Combinations of pANCA, ASCA, anti-CBir1 and anti-OmpC were most accurate in
      predicting incident CD and UC (area under curve 0.679 and 0.657, respectively).
      The predictive value of the combination of markers increased when time to
      diagnosis of CD or UC decreased. CONCLUSION: A panel of serological markers is
      able to predict development of CD and UC in individuals from a low-risk
      population.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A six-week course of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is
      recommended as first treatment in active paediatric Crohn's disease (CD). We
      aimed to assess short-term and long-term outcome of EEN, and to identify
      predictive factors of treatment success. METHODS: The medical records of newly
      diagnosed paediatric CD patients initiating EEN as remission induction therapy
      between January 2008 and October 2011 were retrospectively studied. Treatment
      outcome was assessed using a previously described pattern recognition model.
      RESULTS: 77 CD patients (median age 13.9 years, 57% male) initiated a six-week
      course of EEN, combined with azathioprine maintenance treatment in 92%. Patients 
      received EEN as either hyperosmolar sip feeds or polymeric formula by nasogastric
      tube. In patients completing a six-week course of EEN (n=58), complete remission 
      was achieved in 71%, partial remission in 26%, and no response in 3%. Complete
      remission rates were higher in children presenting with isolated ileal/ileocaecal
      disease and malnutrition. Nineteen patients discontinued EEN before the intended 
      treatment period due to worsening of symptoms (n=9) or adherence issues (n=10).
      Non-adherence occurred more often in older children, females, children from
      non-Dutch parents, and patients taking hyperosmolar sip feeds compared with
      polymeric formula by nasogastric tube. The likelihood of relapsing disease within
      the first year after EEN treatment was 59%. CONCLUSION: A six-week course of EEN 
      is effective in newly diagnosed paediatric CD, with response rates that seem to
      be influenced by disease location and nutritional status, but not by type of
      formula. Non-adherence occurs frequently and limits the success of this treatment
      in everyday clinical practice.

AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic granulomatous disease of unknown etiology that 
      affects primarily the gastrointestinal system but can be associated with
      extraintestinal manifestations. Latent pulmonary involvement in children with CD 
      has been described, but symptomatic pulmonary disease has rarely been reported in
      children. In this review, we report two pediatric cases, one with pleural
      effusion at the time of CD diagnosis and the other with bilateral cavitary
      lesions in a previously diagnosed CD patient. We review the current literature
      and summarize the diagnosis and management of pulmonary involvement in CD.
      Awareness of these pulmonary complications of CD in children may lead to more
      prompt diagnosis, guide appropriate therapy, and decrease morbidity.

TI  - Ischaemia-induced mucus barrier loss and bacterial penetration are rapidly
      counteracted by increased goblet cell secretory activity in human and rat colon.
PG  - 250-8
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2011-301956 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Colonic ischaemia is frequently observed in clinical practice. This
      study provides a novel insight into the pathophysiology of colon
      ischaemia/reperfusion (IR) using a newly developed human and rat experimental
      model. DESIGN: In 10 patients a small part of colon that had to be removed for
      surgical reasons was isolated and exposed to 60 min of ischaemia (60I)
      with/without different periods of reperfusion (30R and 60R). Tissue not exposed
      to IR served as control. In rats, colon was exposed to 60I, 60I/30R, 60I/120R or 
      60I/240R (n=7 per group). The tissue was snap-frozen or fixed in glutaraldehyde, 
      formalin or methacarn fixative. Mucins were stained with Periodic Acid
      Schiff/Alcian Blue (PAS/AB) and MUC2/Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA). Bacteria
      were studied using electron microscopy (EM) and fluorescent in situ hybridisation
      (FISH). Neutrophils were studied using myeloperoxidase staining. qPCR was
      performed for MUC2, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta and tumour necrosis factor
      alpha. RESULTS: In rats, PAS/AB and MUC2/DBA staining revealed mucus layer
      detachment at ischaemia which was accompanied by bacterial penetration (in EM and
      FISH). Human and rat studies showed that, simultaneously, goblet cell secretory
      activity increased. This was associated with expulsion of bacteria from the
      crypts and restoration of the mucus layer at 240 min of reperfusion. Inflammation
      was limited to minor influx of neutrophils and increased expression of
      proinflammatory cytokines during reperfusion. CONCLUSIONS: Colonic ischaemia
      leads to disruption of the mucus layer facilitating bacterial penetration. This
      is rapidly counteracted by increased secretory activity of goblet cells, leading 
      to expulsion of bacteria from the crypts as well as restoration of the mucus
      barrier.

AB  - To the best of our knowledge, no cases of ulcerative colitis (UC) mimicking
      Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) have been reported so far. During a 28-year period
      5635 patients were followed up at our Pediatric Rheumatology Unit and 357 had HSP
      according to the European League Against Rheumatism, the Paediatric Rheumatology 
      International Trials Organisation and the Paediatric Rheumatology European
      Society validated classification criteria. At the same period, 148 patients with 
      IBD according to the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology
      and Nutrition criteria were followed up at the Pediatric Gastroenterology Unit in
      our University Hospital. Only two of them had vasculitis, as an extra intestinal 
      manifestation of UC mimicking HSP, and fulfilled both disease criteria. A 2-year 
      old girl had bloody diarrhoea, severe abdominal pain, arthritis in ankles,
      petechiae and palpable purpura not related to thrombocytopenia in lower limbs. A 
      5-year old boy had bloody diarrhoea, palpable purpura in buttocks, lower limbs,
      penis and scrotum associated with arthritis in knees, orchitis in right testicle 
      and periarticular swelling in hands and feet. Their ileocolonoscopy showed
      diffuse mucosal erythema, oedema, friability and multiple irregular ulcers, and
      histopathological examination of colonic specimen revealed diffuse chronic
      mucosal inflammation, crypt distortion and crypt abscesses suggesting ulcerative 
      colitis. There were no signs of intestinal vasculitis in both cases. In
      conclusion, this is the first study in a paediatric population that evidenced
      palpable purpura associated with UC mimicking HSP.

TI  - The mRNA level of the transforming growth factor beta1 gene, but not the amount
      of the gene product, can be considered as a potential prognostic parameter in
      inflammatory bowel diseases in children.
PG  - 165-72
LID - 10.1007/s00384-012-1489-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) plays a role in cell
      proliferation and differentiation, and it can modulate immune response. In this
      work, we asked whether levels of either TGF-beta1 or mRNA of the corresponding
      gene in plasma or tissue can be useful in diagnosing and/or monitoring of the
      clinical course of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). METHODS: The study group
      consisted of 104 pediatric patients with IBD: 36 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 68
      with ulcerative colitis (UC); 42 children represented the control group.
      TGF-beta1 levels in plasma and intestinal mucosa were estimated by ELISA and
      immunohistochemistry (IHC), respectively. Levels of TGF-beta1 mRNA were
      determined by reverse transcription and real-time PCR. RESULTS: In patients with 
      IBD, and in subgroups with CD and UC, no significant differences in the TGF-beta1
      level in plasma and tissue were found relative to the control group. These
      variables were not dependent on the stage of the disease, its activity or
      severity of endoscopic and histopathological findings. TGF-beta1 mRNA levels were
      significantly higher in tissue samples withdrawn during the relapse of the
      disease than in those taken during the remission or in the control group.
      However, no correlation between TGF-beta1 plasma levels and TGF-beta1 mRNA amount
      in the intestinal mucosa was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The TGF-beta1 mRNA level, but
      not the amount of the gene product, was significantly increased in the
      pathologically changed tissue during the relapse of IBD. We suggest that this
      parameter might be considered as a potential prognostic value when assessing IBD 
      in children.

TI  - Atypical disease phenotypes in pediatric ulcerative colitis: 5-year analyses of
      the EUROKIDS Registry.
PG  - 370-7
LID - 10.1002/ibd.23013 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Definitive diagnosis of pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC) may be
      particularly challenging since isolated colitis with overlapping features is
      common in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD), while atypical phenotypes of UC are not
      uncommon. The Paris classification allows more accurate phenotyping of atypical
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Our aim was to identify the prevalence
      of atypical disease patterns in new-onset pediatric UC using the Paris
      classification. METHODS: Information was collected from the EUROKIDS Registry, an
      inception cohort of untreated pediatric IBD patients undergoing evaluation at
      diagnosis. Patients with IBD-unclassified were excluded. Patients with isolated
      Crohn's colitis served as a control group. RESULTS: Data from 898 pediatric
      patients (643 UC, 255 CD colitis) were included. Extensive or pancolitis was
      present in 77% of UC patients and macroscopic rectal sparing in 5%. Rectal
      sparing was inversely associated with age (mean age with rectal sparing 9.9 years
      vs. 11.8 without; P = 0.02). Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) involvement occurred in
      4% of patients. Erosions in the stomach were present in 3.1% of children, but
      frank ulcerations in 0.4%; 0.8% of children had erosions or ulcerations limited
      to the esophagus or duodenum. The corresponding UGI involvement in Crohn's
      colitis was 22%. A cecal patch occurred in 2% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Extensive
      disease and rectal sparing are age-dependent phenotypes in pediatric UC. Rectal
      sparing, cecal patch, backwash ileitis, and gastric erosions are not uncommon at 
      diagnosis, while gastric ulcerations and erosions in the duodenum or esophagus
      are. Recognition of atypical phenotypes in pediatric-onset UC is crucial to
      prevent misclassification of IBD.

TI  - Sixty-year study of incidence of childhood ulcerative colitis finds eleven-fold
      increase beginning in 1990s.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We sought to define the point at which a recently noted marked
      increase in the incidence of ulcerative colitis (UC) had occurred in children in 
      Victoria, Australia. METHODS: A 60-year retrospective review (1950-2009) of
      children age 16 years or less diagnosed with UC in the state's major pediatric
      centers was performed. RESULTS: In all, 342 children were diagnosed with UC (male
      to female ratio of 1.25:1.0, median age 10.9 years, interquartile range [IQR]
      7.0, 13.2). The overall median annual incidence of UC was 0.36/10(5) children </=
      16 years of age (IQR 0.18, 0.66). The number of reported cases increased by
      11-fold during the study period (P < 0.001). This marked increase appeared to
      occur from the early 1990s and has yet to plateau. Children diagnosed during the 
      last two decades were older at diagnosis (median 10 years vs. 11.6, P < 0.0001), 
      and had higher weight- and height-for-age z scores than those diagnosed during
      the first 40 years (mean weight-for-age [standard deviation] 1950-1989: -0.80
      [1.56] vs. 1990-2009: -0.11 [1.17], P < 0.001; mean height-for-age 1950-1989:
      -0.50 [1.15] vs. 1990-2009: -0.13 [1.12], P < 0.05). More recently diagnosed
      children also had more extensive disease (1950-1989: 52% vs. 1990-2009: 71%, P < 
      0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of UC has increased markedly in Victorian
      children since 1990. Although some of this change may be attributable to earlier 
      diagnosis, it is unlikely that this can provide a complete explanation for this
      still-increasing condition.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anti tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) agents have become widely
      used in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). So far, only few studies
      examined the long-term results of anti-TNFalpha treatment in children with IBD.
      METHODS: The long-term outcome of pediatric patients with IBD was assessed
      retrospectively in a multicenter cohort of children treated with anti-TNFalpha
      beyond induction treatment. Short- and long-term response rates, predictors for
      loss of response, data on growth and laboratory parameters were assessed.
      RESULTS: 120 patients [101 crohn's disease (CD), 19 ulcerative colitis (UC) or
      indeterminate colitis (IC)] received either infliximab or adalimumab. The mean
      age at initiation of anti-TNFalpha was 13.4 +/- 3.9 years and the median duration
      of anti-TNFalpha treatment was 15 months (range: 2-90). Overall, 89% of the
      cohort experienced short-term response following induction. Response was
      associated with improvement in weight and BMI Z-scores (p<0.001) but not with
      linear growth. Responders experienced a significant decrease in erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate (ESR) and C reactive protein (CRP) during treatment (p<0.001).
      Albumin and hemoglobin both improved but only albumin increased significantly
      (p<0.001). The cumulative probability of losing response to anti-TNFalpha
      treatment was 17%, 38%, and 49% after 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Responders
      had a significantly lower weight and BMI Z-scores at initiation of anti-TNFalpha 
      treatment in compared to non-responders (p=0.04 and 0.02 respectively).
      CONCLUSIONS: Our long term cohort supports the current evidence on the
      effectiveness and safety of anti-TNFalpha treatment in children with IBD.
      Response to treatment was interestingly associated with lower weight and BMI.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Serious infections are an important side effect of
      immunosuppressive therapy used to treat Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative
      colitis (UC). There have been no nationally representative studies examining the 
      spectrum of infection related hospitalizations in patients with IBD. METHODS: Our
      study consisted of all adult CD and UC related hospitalizations from the
      Nationwide Inpatient Sample 2007, a national hospitalization database in the
      United States. We then identified all infection-related hospitalizations through 
      codes for either the specific infections or disease processes (sepsis, pneumonia,
      etc.). Predictors of infections as well as the excess morbidity associated with
      infections were determined using multivariate regression models. RESULTS: There
      were an estimated 67,221 hospitalizations related to infections in IBD patients, 
      comprising 27.5% of all IBD hospitalizations. On multivariate analysis,
      infections were independently associated with age, co-morbidity, malnutrition,
      TPN, and bowel surgery. Infection-related hospitalizations had a four-fold
      greater mortality (OR 4.4, 95% CI 3.7-5.2). However, this varied by type of
      infection with the strongest effect seen for sepsis (OR 15.3, 95% CI 12.4-18.6), 
      pneumonia (OR 3.6, 95% CI 2.9-4.5) and C. difficile (OR 3.2, 95% CI 2.6-4.0), and
      weaker effects for urinary infections (OR 1.4, 95%CI 1.1-1.7). Infections were
      also associated with an estimated 2.3 days excess hospital stay (95% CI 2.2-2.5) 
      and $12,482 in hospitalization charges. CONCLUSION: Infections account for
      significant morbidity and mortality in patients with IBD and disproportionately
      impact older IBD patients with greater co-morbidity. Pneumonia, sepsis and C
      difficile infection are associated with the greatest excess mortality risk.

AB  - The number of microorganisms inhabiting the human digestive tract exceeds the
      number of body cells by a factor of ten. This microbial community affects host
      physiology and host health. The metabolic potential of the gut microbiota is
      immense affording the extraction of energy from otherwise indigestible
      carbohydrates (dietary fiber) and the conversion of host-derived substances,
      non-nutritive dietary components and drugs. Recognized functions of the gut
      microbiota include provision of colonization resistance against pathogens and
      priming of both the innate and the acquired immune systems. However, the
      intestinal microbiota may also contribute to the development of diseases such as 
      ulcerative colitis and colorectal cancer. Culture-dependent studies provided
      basic knowledge on the gut microbiota, but only the advent of culture-independent
      molecular methods led to a better understanding of host-microbe interactions. The
      application of metagenomics to the gut microbial ecosystem revealed truly
      remarkable correlations between certain diseases and the gut microbiome. It also 
      led to the suggestion of the existence of a 'core microbiome' that encompasses
      key functions shared by each individual. However, the mechanisms underlying
      host-microbe interactions have not yet been unraveled.

AB  - Numerous complications can occur in celiac disease, nutritional (growth failure
      in children, malnutrition, vitamin deficiencies), hematologic (anaemia), bone
      disease (osteoporosis, fracture), gynaecologic (hypo fertility), cardiovascular
      (coronaropathy, venous thrombosis), neurological (peripheral neuropathy), hepatic
      (cytolysis, cirrhosis). Celiac disease is associated with an increased risk of
      autoimmune diseases (type 1 diabetes, thyroiditis), and cancer (upper digestive
      tract, hepatocellular carcinoma, lymphoma). The main digestive complications are 
      microscopic colitis and refractory sprue, which are resistant to gluten-free
      diet. It can be associated with a monoclonal proliferation of intraepithelial
      lymphocytes (type 2 refractory sprue), which may be considered as a cryptic
      lymphoma and can lead to invasive T lymphoma, which occurs in one celiac patient 
      in 1000. Gluten-free diet protects from the occurrence of most complications and 
      correct the over-mortality related to these complications.
