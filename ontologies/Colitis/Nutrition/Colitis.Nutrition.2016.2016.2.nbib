AB  - In cystic fibrosis (CF), approximately 5-8% of the patients develop multilobular 
      cirrhosis during the first decade of life. Annual screening (clinical
      examination, liver biochemistry, ultrasonography) is recommended in order to
      identify early signs of liver involvement, initiate ursodeoxycholic acid therapy 
      and detect complications (portal hypertension and liver failure). Management
      should focus on nutrition and prevention of variceal bleeding. The gut may also
      be involved in children with CF. Gastroesophageal reflux is frequent, although
      often neglected and should be investigated by pH monitoring and impedancemetry,
      if available. Acute pancreatitis occurs in patients with persistent exocrine
      pancreatic activity. Intussusception, appendicular mucocele, distal intestinal
      occlusion syndrome, small bowel bacterial overgrowth and Clostridium difficile
      colitis should be considered in case of abdominal pain. Preventive nutritional
      support should be started as soon as possible after diagnosis of CF. Attainment
      of normal growth is one of the main goals and can be achieved with hypercaloric
      and salt supplemented food. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy should be
      started as soon as exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is confirmed and ingested
      immediately prior to meals with intake of fat-soluble vitamins. Curative
      nutritional interventions are more likely to be effective in the early stages of 
      pulmonary disease. Feeding disorders, related to the physiopathology and the
      psychologic aspects of the disease are frequent. Repeated corporeal aggressions, 
      associated with inappropriate medical and parental pressure, may increase the
      child's refusal of food. The multidisciplinary team should guide parents in order
      to avoid all intrusive feeding practices and promote pleasant mealtimes.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The ESPEN guideline presents a multidisciplinary focus on clinical 
      nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODOLOGY: The guideline is
      based on extensive systematic review of the literature, but relies on expert
      opinion when objective data were lacking or inconclusive. The conclusions and 64 
      recommendations have been subject to full peer review and a Delphi process in
      which uniformly positive responses (agree or strongly agree) were required.
      RESULTS: IBD is increasingly common and potential dietary factors in its
      aetiology are briefly reviewed. Malnutrition is highly prevalent in IBD -
      especially in Crohn's disease. Increased energy and protein requirements are
      observed in some patients. The management of malnutrition in IBD is considered
      within the general context of support for malnourished patients. Treatment of
      iron deficiency (parenterally if necessary) is strongly recommended. Routine
      provision of a special diet in IBD is not however supported. Parenteral nutrition
      is indicated only when enteral nutrition has failed or is impossible. The
      recommended perioperative management of patients with IBD undergoing surgery
      accords with general ESPEN guidance for patients having abdominal surgery.
      Probiotics may be helpful in UC but not Crohn's disease. Primary therapy using
      nutrition to treat IBD is not supported in ulcerative colitis, but is moderately 
      well supported in Crohn's disease, especially in children where the adverse
      consequences of steroid therapy are proportionally greater. However, exclusion
      diets are generally not recommended and there is little evidence to support any
      particular formula feed when nutritional regimens are constructed. CONCLUSIONS:
      Available objective data to guide nutritional support and primary nutritional
      therapy in IBD are presented as 64 recommendations, of which 9 are very strong
      recommendations (grade A), 22 are strong recommendations (grade B) and 12 are
      based only on sparse evidence (grade 0); 21 recommendations are good practice
      points (GPP).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic and disabling condition. There is
      no curative medical treatment but current treatments provide increasingly
      sustainable control of the disease and allow patients a better quality of life.
      There is limited evidence supporting CD management in specific clinical
      situations, thus precluding an evidence-based approach. AIMS: To help clinicians 
      in making informed treatment decisions, a group of 59 French gastroenterologists 
      with experience in the management of CD met to develop straightforward and
      practical algorithms based on the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation
      (ECCO) recommendations. METHODS: This experts' opinion was developed following a 
      Nominal Group consensus methodology. Nine clinical situations were identified:
      mildly active CD; uncomplicated moderately active CD, with, and without poor
      prognostic factors; uncomplicated severely active CD; perianal CD with a single
      fistula; perianal CD with complex fistula with or without abscess; complicated CD
      with abscess; intestinal stricture; and post-operative CD. Two working groups
      were formed and proposed algorithms that were then approved by a two-thirds
      majority of the Nominal Group. RESULTS: These algorithms represent the pragmatic 
      consensus of a group of experts in gastroenterology on the modalities of
      therapeutic care in different clinical situations in CD. They are available via a
      web application at: www.algorithmici.com.

      cohort.
PG  - 10653-10662
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i48.10653 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Infantile-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IO-IBD) with the onset of
      disease before 12 mo of age, is a different disease entity from childhood IBD. We
      aimed to describe the clinical features, outcome and role of mutation in
      interleukin-10 (IL-10) and interleukin-10 receptors (IL-10R) in Asian children
      with IO-IBD. METHODS: All cases of IO-IBD, defined as onset of disease before 12 
      mo of age, seen at University Malaya Medical Center, Malaysia were reviewed. We
      performed mutational analysis for IL10 and IL10R genes in patients with
      presenting clinical features of Crohn's disease (CD). RESULTS: Six [13%; CD = 3, 
      ulcerative colitis (UC) = 2, IBD-unclassified (IBD-U) = 1] of the 48 children (CD
      = 25; UC = 23) with IBD have IO-IBD. At final review [median (range) duration of 
      follow-up: 6.5 (3.0-20) years], three patients were in remission without
      immunosuppression [one each for post-colostomy (IBD-U), after standard
      immunosuppression (CD), and after total colectomy (UC)]. Three patients were on
      immunosuppression: one (UC) was in remission while two (both CD) had persistent
      disease. As compared with later-onset disease, IO-IBD were more likely to present
      with bloody diarrhea (100% vs 55%, P = 0.039) but were similar in terms of an
      associated autoimmune liver disease (0% vs 19%, P = 0.31), requiring biologics
      therapy (50% vs 36%, P = 0.40), surgery (50% vs 29%, P = 0.27), or achieving
      remission (50% vs 64%, P = 0.40). No mutations in either IL10 or IL10R in the
      three patients with CD and the only patient with IBD-U were identified.
      CONCLUSION: The clinical features of IO-IBD in this Asian cohort of children who 
      were negative for IL-10 or IL-10R mutations were variable. As compared to
      childhood IBD with onset of disease after 12 mo of age, IO-IBD achieved remission
      at a similar rate.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Autoimmune cytopenias (AIC) including autoimmune hemolytic anemia
      (AIHA) and immunologic thrombocytopenia (ITP) are rare immunologic disorders,
      scarcely reported in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). We conducted a
      multicentric retrospective study, including a case-control analysis, that aimed
      to describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients affected by AIC and IBD.
      METHOD: Forty cases were recruited from 4 IBD centers and 2 AIC tertiary centers.
      Controls were recruited from the MICISTA registry. RESULTS: From the MICISTA
      registry, incidences were estimated at 4.1/100,000 patient-years and 12.5/100,000
      patient-years after IBD diagnosis for AIHA and ITP, respectively. All AIHA
      patients (n=14) had colonic involvement (13/14 with UC), whereas CD (52%) and UC 
      (48%) diagnoses were evenly distributed among ITP patients. Compared to control
      IBD patients, cases were characterized by a higher frequency of extra-intestinal 
      manifestations (37.5% vs 17%, p<0.001) and by the presence of IBD severity's
      hallmark. AIHA and IBD ran mainly in parallel, and 12 out of 14 AIHA were warm
      AIHA. In isolated cases, rituximab and infliximab were efficient to treat IBD and
      AIC, respectively. IBD surgery may induce AIC remission in some cases.
      CONCLUSION: Although low, incidence of AIC appears higher in IBD patients
      compared to the general population. The association seems to be mainly
      non-fortuitous, especially for colitis-associated AIHA.

AB  - Physical health has a direct relationship with digestive function. Any
      abnormalities in the link may cause malnutrition, endocrine disorders, and the
      decline of organ functions. Obestatin, a biologically active peptide, is encoded 
      by the ghrelin gene. Most studies suggest that obestatin is a pleiotropic
      peptide, which acts by suppressing the motility of the gastrointestinal tract,
      regulating the secretion of insulin, reducing inflammation and apoptosis, and
      promoting proliferation. These characteristics suggest that obestatin may
      represent an efficient way to prevent the occurrence and development of some
      digestive diseases. However, the functions of obestatin are not clear, and even
      appear to be contradictory. The aim of this review was to discuss the close
      relationship between obestatin and the digestive system, and to provide a unique 
      perspective for the future development of obestatin relative to digestive
      diseases.

TI  - Genetic architecture differences between pediatric and adult-onset inflammatory
      bowel diseases in the Polish population.
PG  - 39831
LID - 10.1038/srep39831 [doi]
AB  - Most inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are classic complex disorders represented
      by common alleles. Here we aimed to define the genetic architecture of pediatric 
      and adult-onset IBDs for the Polish population. A total of 1495 patients were
      recruited, including 761 patients with Crohn's disease (CD; 424 pediatric), 734
      patients with ulcerative colitis (UC; 390 pediatric), and 934 healthy controls.
      Allelotyping employed a pooled-DNA genome-wide association study (GWAS) and was
      validated by individual genotyping. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on
      44 IBD patients diagnosed before 6 years of age, 45 patients diagnosed after 40
      years of age, and 18 healthy controls. Altogether, out of 88 selected SNPs, 31
      SNPs were replicated for association with IBD. A novel BRD2 (rs1049526)
      association reached significance of P = 5.2 x 10(-11) and odds ratio (OR) = 2.43.
      Twenty SNPs were shared between pediatric and adult patients; 1 and 7 were unique
      to adult-onset and pediatric-onset IBD, respectively. WES identified numerous
      rare and potentially deleterious variants in IBD-associated or innate
      immunity-associated genes. Deleterious alleles in both groups were
      over-represented among rare variants in affected children. Our GWAS revealed
      differences in the polygenic architecture of pediatric- and adult-onset IBD. A
      significant accumulation of rare and deleterious variants in affected children
      suggests a contribution by yet unexplained genetic components.

AB  - Among the neoplasias, colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer
      death in men and women. The increasing incidence of this type of cancer is due to
      the increase in the population's life expectancy, by the increase in chronic
      inflammatory bowel diseases, primarily ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease,
      and the change in eating habits. The American Cancer Society (2011) shows that
      diet might be responsible for approximately 30% of cancer cases in developed
      countries, moreover when considering only colorectal cancer, the number can reach
      30% to 50%. Probiotics are effective in the prevention and treatment of many
      bowel diseases as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), diarrhea, irritable bowel
      syndrome, gluten intolerance, gastroenteritis, Helicobacter pyloriinfection, and 
      colon cancer. Classical examples are strains from the Lactobacillus, and
      Bifidobacteriumgenus that have probiotic proprieties with a potential use in the 
      prophylaxis, as well as in the treatment of a variety of gastrointestinal tract
      disorders. Researchers are focusing on extremely important studies regarding the 
      possibility of using probiotics to promote a balanced microbiota composition, and
      a sufficient immunological surveillance system as a way to prevent cancer.
      Considering the fact that the human intestines host 100 trillion bacteria,
      including more than 1,000 species, there is still need to perform more in depth
      investigations in order to find probiotics with potential to prevent, and treat
      cancerous diseases, adding a very promising effect to this already successful
      panorama. This revision aims to conduct a review of the most recent studies
      correlating probiotics and its cancer preventing and treatment potential.

      risk loci and quantifies the genetic relationship with inflammatory bowel
      disease.

AB  - Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare progressive disorder leading to
      bile duct destruction; approximately 75% of patients have comorbid inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD). We undertook the largest genome-wide association study of
      PSC (4,796 cases and 19,955 population controls) and identified four new
      genome-wide significant loci. The most associated SNP at one locus affects
      splicing and expression of UBASH3A, with the protective allele (C) predicted to
      cause nonstop-mediated mRNA decay and lower expression of UBASH3A. Further
      analyses based on common variants suggested that the genome-wide genetic
      correlation (rG) between PSC and ulcerative colitis (UC) (rG = 0.29) was
      significantly greater than that between PSC and Crohn's disease (CD) (rG = 0.04) 
      (P = 2.55 x 10(-15)). UC and CD were genetically more similar to each other (rG =
      0.56) than either was to PSC (P < 1.0 x 10(-15)). Our study represents a
      substantial advance in understanding of the genetics of PSC.

LID - 10.1038/srep39399 [doi]
AB  - The intestinal microbiota of patients with constipated-predominant irritable
      bowel syndrome (C-IBS) displays chronic dysbiosis. Our aim was to determine
      whether this microbial imbalance instigates perturbation of the host intestinal
      mucosal immune response, using a model of human microbiota-associated rats (HMAR)
      and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced experimental colitis. The analysis of
      the microbiota composition revealed a decrease of the relative abundance of
      Bacteroides, Roseburia-Eubacterium rectale and Bifidobacterium and an increase of
      Enterobacteriaceae, Desulfovibrio sp., and mainly Akkermansia muciniphila in
      C-IBS patients compared to healthy individuals. The bacterial diversity of the
      gut microbiota of healthy individuals or C-IBS patients was maintained in
      corresponding HMAR. Animals harboring a C-IBS microbiota had reduced DSS colitis 
      with a decreased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines from innate, Th1, and
      Th17 responses. The pre-treatment of conventional C57BL/6 mice or HMAR with A.
      muciniphila, but not with Escherichia coli, prior exposure to DSS also resulted
      in a reduction of colitis severity, highlighting that the anti-inflammatory
      effect of the gut microbiota of C-IBS patients is mediated, in part, by A.
      muciniphila. This work highlights a novel aspect of the crosstalk between the gut
      microbiota of C-IBS patients and host intestinal homeostasis.

PG  - e0168276
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0168276 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genetic variation in the Laccase (multicopper oxidoreductase)
      domain-containing 1 (LACC1) gene has been shown to affect the risk of Crohn's
      disease, leprosy and, more recently, ulcerative colitis and juvenile idiopathic
      arthritis. LACC1 function appears to promote fatty-acid oxidation, with
      concomitant inflammasome activation, reactive oxygen species production, and
      anti-bacterial responses in macrophages. We sought to contribute to elucidating
      LACC1 biological function by extensive characterization of its expression in
      human tissues and cells, and through preliminary analyses of the regulatory
      mechanisms driving such expression. METHODS: We implemented Western blot,
      quantitative real-time PCR, immunofluorescence microscopy, and flow cytometry
      analyses to investigate fatty acid metabolism-immune nexus (FAMIN; the LACC1
      encoded protein) expression in subcellular compartments, cell lines and relevant 
      human tissues. Gene-set enrichment analyses were performed to initially
      investigate modulatory mechanisms of LACC1 expression. A small-interference RNA
      knockdown in vitro model system was used to study the effect of FAMIN depletion
      on peroxisome function. RESULTS: FAMIN expression was detected in
      macrophage-differentiated THP-1 cells and several human tissues, being highest in
      neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells
      among peripheral blood cells. Subcellular co-localization was exclusively
      confined to peroxisomes, with some additional positivity for organelle
      endomembrane structures. LACC1 co-expression signatures were enriched for genes
      involved in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) signaling
      pathways, and PPAR ligands downregulated FAMIN expression in in vitro model
      systems. CONCLUSION: FAMIN is a peroxisome-associated protein with primary
      role(s) in macrophages and other immune cells, where its metabolic functions may 
      be modulated by PPAR signaling events. However, the precise molecular mechanisms 
      through which FAMIN exerts its biological effects in immune cells remain to be
      elucidated.

AB  - Geographic patterns with diminishing rates from north to south toward the equator
      have been described for a number of diseases, putatively related largely to
      "western" lifestyle. Among these the inflammatory bowel diseases; Crohn's (CD)
      and Ulcerative colitis (UC) have been prominent in sharing distributions with a
      number of autoimmune diseases. One of the interesting associations is the
      epidemiologic similarity with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, in addition, at
      least some of these diseases also correlated inversely with lactase non
      persistent population (LNP) distributions. It is hypothesized that MS should also
      have an inverse relationship with LNP. We provide support for this by comparing
      published MS, CD, UC and LNP national rates to the beginning of the new
      millennium. Possible links among these diseases may be an evolutionary signature 
      of new genes which may have accompanied emergence of lactase persistence
      millennia ago. The emergent phenotypic dichotomy also forced different
      assimilation responses to lactose digestion. While intestinal retention of
      lactase results in direct host enzymatic digestion, in LNP persons intestinal
      bacterial metabolism of lactose impacts on the host micro-flora. These microbial 
      changes may play some role in altering rates of diseases including IBD and MS.
      However, since the late 20th century previously observed patterns are changing.
      Although industrialization is considered to play an important modifying role, the
      rising rates of obesity with an emphasis on diet, and microfloral pathogenesis,
      but with an independent geographic pattern may also facilitate altering rates and
      geographic distributions of both of these and other diseases.

TI  - Prebiotics and synbiotics in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 477-485
LID - 10.1080/00365521.2016.1263680 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the
      colon with unclear pathogenesis. A dysbiotic intestinal microbiota is regarded as
      a key component in the disease process and there has been significant interest in
      developing new treatments which target the microbiota. AIM: To give an overview
      of the studies to date investigating prebiotics and synbiotics for the treatment 
      of UC. METHODS: A literature search of PubMed and related search engines was
      carried out using the terms "ulcerative colitis" in combination with "prebiotic",
      "synbiotic" or "dietary fibre". RESULTS: In total 17 studies on humans examining 
      the effect of prebiotics in UC were found. Five major groups could be
      distinguished. Fructo-oligosaccharides were tried in six studies (mean 35
      patients included, range 9-121). One study found a clinical response while two
      demonstrated indirect evidence of an effect. Germinated barley foodstuff was used
      in 8 studies (mean 38 patients, range 10-63). One study found an endoscopic
      response, while four noted a clinical response and two some indirect effects.
      Galacto-oligosaccharides, lactulose and resveratrol were used in one study each
      (mean 48 patients, range 41-52). One study found an endoscopic response and one a
      clinical response. CONCLUSION: There is yet inadequate evidence - especially in
      humans - to support any particular prebiotic in the clinical management of UC.
      However, due to the bulk of evidence supporting the effect of the microbiota on
      colonic inflammation, there is enough potential to justify further high-quality
      clinical trials investigating this subject.

TI  - Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's Disease Are Associated with Decreased Serum
      Selenium Concentrations and Increased Cardiovascular Risk.
LID - E780 [pii]
AB  - The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and associated oxidative stress
      is increasing. The antioxidant mineral selenium (Se) was measured in serum
      samples from 106 IBD patients (53 with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 53 with
      Crohn's disease (CD)) and from 30 healthy controls. Serum Se concentrations were 
      significantly lower in UC and CD patients than in healthy controls (p < 0.001)
      and significantly lower in CD patients than in UC patients (p = 0.006). Se
      concentrations in patients were significantly influenced by sex, body mass index 
      (BMI), the inflammatory biomarker alpha-1-antitrypsin, surgery, medical
      treatment, the severity, extent, and form of the disease and the length of time
      since onset (p < 0.05). Se concentrations in IBD patients were positively and
      linearly correlated with nutritional (protein, albumin, prealbumin,
      cholinesterase and total cholesterol) and iron status-related (hemoglobin, Fe and
      hematocrit) parameters (p < 0.05). A greater impairment of serum Se and
      cardiovascular status was observed in CD than in UC patients. An adequate
      nutritional Se status is important in IBD patients to minimize the cardiovascular
      risk associated with increased inflammation biomarkers, especially in
      undernourished CD patients, and is also related to an improved nutritional and
      body iron status.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Eosinophils are implicated in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis.
      AIMS: To evaluate the magnitude of mucosal and blood eosinophils in newly
      diagnosed pediatric ulcerative colitis patients and its significance in
      predicting disease outcomes. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated colorectal
      biopsies of 96 pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis and 50 age- and
      sex-matched controls. Samples were taken from diseased areas of the colon and
      examined by a gastrointestinal pathologist. The most inflamed site was used for
      assessment of mucosal eosinophils. RESULTS: Samples from 96 diagnostic and 70
      follow-up colonoscopies were evaluated. Median age was 13.3 years (IQR
      10.1-15.3). Median duration of follow-up was 12.8 years (IQR 7.2-17.1). Median
      number of tissue eosinophils at diagnosis was 45 (IQR 22-73) compared to 10
      eosinophils (IQR 8-25) during histologic remission (p<0.0001). Peripheral
      absolute eosinophil counts correlated with tissue inflammation and eosinophilia
      (p=0.001). Mucosal eosinophilic infiltration (p=0.02) and peripheral eosinophilia
      (p=0.04) was associated with clinical severity at diagnosis. Multivariate
      analysis showed that severe eosinophilic infiltration is associated with
      corticosteroid therapy following diagnosis (p=0.04) but not with long-term risk
      for step-up therapy or colectomy. CONCLUSION: Tissue and peripheral eosinophilia 
      correlate with ulcerative colitis severity at diagnosis and with short-term
      corticosteroid requirement but not with long-term outcomes.

      the group of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) than the group with ulcerative
      colitis (UC) (P<0.001). The overall decrease in mean hsCRP concentration observed
      during the follow-up period was larger in the group of CD patients. The analysis 
      showed a correlation between hsCRP concentrations at diagnosis and risk of
      surgery in the group of CD patients (r=0.408, P=0.002), but not in the group of
      UC patients. In a logistic regression analysis, surgery in CD patients was
      associated with age (OR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.8-1.0, P=0.05) and hsCRP concentration
      (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.0-1.04, P=0.03) at diagnosis. DISCUSSION: HsCRP might be a
      useful diagnostic marker in differentiating active IBD from other diseases.
      Particularly important however seems to be the predictive value of hsCRP at
      diagnosis in prognosing the clinical outcome of the disease in CD patients.

TI  - Current evaluation and management of anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 19-32
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Anemia is a common extraintestinal manifestation in IBD patients
      and considerably impacts disease prognosis, hospitalization rates and time lost
      from work. While iron deficiency anemia is predominant, combinations of
      hematimetric and biochemical markers enable detection and targeted therapy of
      other etiologies including vitamin B12/folic acid deficiencies, hemolysis,
      myelosuppression and pharmacotherapies. Areas covered: Current literature was
      searched for articles focusing on etiology, diagnostics and therapy of anemia in 
      IBD. In the light of their own experience, the authors describe the physiology of
      anemia in IBD and present current evidence endorsing diagnostic and therapeutic
      options, focusing particularly on non-iron-related etiologies. Expert commentary:
      Anemia in IBD is polyetiological, reaching far beyond iron deficiency anemia.
      While clinicians need to be aware of the increasing pallet of diagnostic tools
      and therapeutic options, detailed studies are needed to develop more convenient
      test procedures, long-term treatment and monitoring strategies, and unified
      guidelines for daily practice.

TI  - Altered intestinal microbiota-host mitochondria crosstalk in new onset Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 13419
LID - 10.1038/ncomms13419 [doi]
AB  - Intestinal microbial dysbiosis is associated with Crohn's disease (CD). However, 
      the mechanisms leading to the chronic mucosal inflammation that characterizes
      this disease remain unclear. In this report, we use systems-level approaches to
      study the interactions between the gut microbiota and host in new-onset
      paediatric patients to evaluate causality and mechanisms of disease. We report an
      altered host proteome in CD patients indicative of impaired mitochondrial
      functions. In particular, mitochondrial proteins implicated in H2S detoxification
      are downregulated, while the relative abundance of H2S microbial producers is
      increased. Network correlation analysis reveals that Atopobium parvulum controls 
      the central hub of H2S producers. A. parvulum induces pancolitis in
      colitis-susceptible interleukin-10-deficient mice and this phenotype requires the
      presence of the intestinal microbiota. Administrating the H2S scavenger bismuth
      mitigates A. parvulum-induced colitis in vivo. This study reveals that
      host-microbiota interactions are disturbed in CD and thus provides mechanistic
      insights into CD pathogenesis.

TI  - De novo inflammatory bowel disease after pediatric kidney or liver transplant.
LID - 10.1111/petr.12835 [doi]
AB  - A subset of children who receive a liver and/or kidney transplant develop de novo
      inflammatory bowel disease-like chronic intestinal inflammation, not explained by
      infection or medications, following transplant. We have conducted a
      single-center, retrospective case series describing the unique clinical and
      histologic features of this IBD-like chronic intestinal inflammation following
      solid organ transplant. At our center, nine of 327 kidney or liver recipients
      developed de novo IBD following transplant (six liver, two kidney, one
      liver-kidney). Most children presented with prolonged hematochezia and diarrhea
      and were treated with aminosalicylates. At time of diagnosis, five were not
      currently using mycophenolate mofetil for transplant immunosuppression.
      Histologic and endoscopic findings at IBD diagnosis included inflammation,
      ulcerations, granulomas, and chronic colitis. Since diagnosis, no patients have
      required surgical intervention, or escalation to biologic therapy, nor developed 
      stricturing or perianal disease. In this case series, de novo post-transplant IBD
      developed in 4% of pediatric liver and/or kidney recipients; however, it often
      does not fit the classic patterns of Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Bamboo Salt Suppresses Colon Carcinogenesis in C57BL/6 Mice with Chemically
      Induced Colitis.
PG  - 1015-1022
AB  - The aim of our experiment was to evaluate the anticancer effect of bamboo salt
      (BS) on C57BL/6 mice in an azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate
      (DSS)-induced colon cancer model. BS, solar salt, and purified salt were
      evaluated for their protective effects during AOM/DSS-induced colon
      carcinogenesis in C57BL/6 mice. BS, especially after baking for nine separate
      intervals (BS9x), suppressed colon carcinogenesis in the mice. BS9x decreased
      colon length shortening, weight-to-length ratios, and tumor counts. Pathological 
      evidence from histological evaluation by hematoxylin and eosin staining also
      revealed suppression of tumorigenesis. BS9x lowered serum levels of
      proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta) to close to those of
      the Normal group. Additionally, BS9x suppressed colon mRNA expression of
      proinflammatory factors and significantly regulated mRNA levels of the
      apoptosis-related factors, Bax and Bcl-2, and the cell cycle-related genes, p21
      and p53. Additionally, immunohistochemistry showed that BS promoted p21
      expression in the colon. Taken together, the results indicate that BS exhibited
      anticancer efficacy by modulating apoptosis- and inflammation-related gene
      expression during colon carcinogenesis in mice, and repetition in baking cycles
      of BS enhanced its anticancer functionality.

TI  - Anti-inflammaging effects of Lactobacillus brevis OW38 in aged mice.
PG  - 707-718
AB  - In the present study, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains were collected from
      kimchi and were screened to isolate strains that inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
      production by Escherichia coli and p16 expression and nuclear factor-kappa B
      (NF-kappaB) activation in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Oral administration of
      Lactobacillus brevis OW38 (1x10(9) cfu/mouse) to aged mice (male, 18 months old) 
      for 8 weeks reduced the LPS level in colon fluid and blood. In addition, OW38
      treatment also reduced the ratio of Firmicutes or Proteobacteria to
      Bacteroidetes, which was significantly higher in aged mice than in young mice.
      Treatment with OW38 in aged mice inhibited the expression of inflammatory
      markers, such as myeloperoxidase, tumour necrosis factor (TNF), and interleukin
      (IL)-1beta, and inhibited NF-kappaB activation. Furthermore, it induced the
      expression of colonic tight junction proteins zonula occludens-1, occludin, and
      claudin-1. OW38 treatment also suppressed the expression of senescence markers
      p16, p53, and SAMHD1 in the colon and the hippocampus of aged mice. In addition, 
      it significantly restored spontaneous alternation as well as the expression of
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor and doublecortin in aged mice compared to that 
      in young mice (P<0.05). Based on these findings, we conclude that OW38 treatment 
      may ameliorate aging-associated colitis and memory impairment by inhibiting gut
      microbiota LPS production, NF-kappaB activation, and p16 expression.

TI  - Nutrition, oxidative stress and intestinal dysbiosis: Influence of diet on gut
      microbiota in inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 461-466
LID - 10.5507/bp.2016.052 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microbiota refers to the population of microorganisms (bacteria,
      viruses and fungi) that inhabit the entire gastrointestinal tract, more
      particularly the colon whose role is to maintain the integrity of the intestinal 
      mucosa and control the proliferation of pathogenic bacteria. Alteration in the
      composition of the gut microbiota is called dysbiosis. Dysbiosis redisposes to
      inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease and
      indeterminate colitis. METHODS: The purpose of this literature review is to
      elucidate the influence of diet on the composition of the gastrointestinal
      microbiota in the healthy gut and the role of diet in the development of
      dysbiosis. CONCLUSION: The "Western diet", in particular a low - fiber high
      fat/high carbohydrate diet is one factor that can lead to severe dysbiosis. In
      contrast, "mediterranean" and vegetarian diets that includes abundant fruits,
      vegetables, olive oil and oily fish are known for their anti-inflammatory effects
      and could prevent dysbiosis and subsequent inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Non-IgE-mediated gastrointestinal food allergies in children.
PG  - 6-17
LID - 10.1111/pai.12659 [doi]
AB  - Non-IgE-mediated gastrointestinal food allergic disorders (non-IgE-GI-FA)
      including food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES), food
      protein-induced enteropathy (FPE), and food protein-induced allergic
      proctocolitis (FPIAP) are relatively uncommon in infants and young children, but 
      are likely under-diagnosed. Non-IgE-GI-FA have a favorable prognosis, with
      majority resolving by age 3-5 years. Diagnosis relies on the recognition of
      symptoms pattern in FPIAP and FPIES and biopsy in FPE. Further studies are needed
      for a better understanding of the pathomechanism, which will lead eventually to
      the development of diagnostic tests and treatments. Limited evidence supports the
      role of food allergens in subsets of constipation, gastroesophageal reflux
      disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and colic. The immunologic pathomechanism is
      not fully understood and empiric prolonged avoidance of food allergens should be 
      limited to minimize nutrient deficiency and feeding disorders/food aversions in
      infants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prebiotic dietary fibers resist digestion in the upper
      gastrointestinal tract and allow for stimulation of bacteria in the distal
      intestine and colon. Stimulation of bacteria among different individuals varies
      greatly, depending on a wide range of variables. OBJECTIVE: To determine the
      range of differences in response between individuals, a preclinical in vitro
      fermentation was conducted with six fecal donors. The primary objective was to
      compare the fecal microbiota of six individuals at baseline, 12 h and 24 h
      post-exposure to partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG). METHOD: Fecal donations
      were collected from six healthy individuals consuming a non-specific Western
      diet, free of antibiotic treatments in the past year, not affected by any GI
      diseases and not consuming any probiotic or prebiotic supplements. Fecal samples 
      were exposed to 0.5 g of PHGG and measured for bacterial changes at 0, 12 and 24 
      h based on 16S rRNA sequencing. RESULTS: Parabacteroides increased from 3.48% of 
      sequence reads to 10.62% of sequence reads after 24 h (p = 0.0181) and
      Bacteroidetes increased from 45.89% of sequence reads to 50.29% of sequence reads
      (p = 0.0008). CONCLUSIONS: PHGG stimulates growth of Parabacteroides, a genus of 
      bacteria that have been inversely associated with IBS and ulcerative colitis.
      PHGG provides stimulation of beneficial Bacteroidetes (Bacteroides and
      Parabacteroides), which may be correlated with many positive health markers and
      outcomes. PHGG is a prebiotic dietary fiber that is readily fermentable.

TI  - Neutrophil volume distribution width as a new marker in detecting inflammatory
      bowel disease activation.
PG  - 51-57
LID - 10.1111/ijlh.12574 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: We sought to investigate the value of neutrophil volume
      distribution width in detecting inflammatory bowel disease activation. METHODS:
      Patients with infection and accompanying inflammatory disease were excluded. All 
      the patients were diagnosed and classified according to Porto criteria and Paris 
      classification, respectively. Physician global assessment, pediatric Crohn's
      disease and pediatric ulcerative colitis activity indexes and fecal calprotectin 
      were used to define disease activation. RESULTS: A total of 34 pediatric patients
      with Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and 29 controls were enrolled in the
      study. Neutrophil volume distribution width (NVDW) was significantly higher in
      patients with IBD compared to healthy controls (P < 0.001). An increased NVDW
      level was observed in IBD patients in activation (22.42 +/- 2.13) compared to
      those in remission (19.22 +/- 1.63) (P < 0.001). There was no statistically
      significant difference between IBD patients in remission and healthy controls.
      The best cutoff of NVDW for prediction of disease activation in Crohn's disease
      and ulcerative colitis in this series was 20.39 with a sensitivity of 90.9% and a
      specificity of 75% (AUC: 0.852 CI: 0.698-1.000 P < 0.001) and 19.74 with a
      sensitivity of 92.9% and a specificity of 90.9% (AUC: 0.961, CI: 0.889-1.000, P <
      0.001), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: As a quantitative, objective, and sensitive
      parameter, we believe that the NVDW has a potential to be an additional test
      detecting disease activation in IBD.

TI  - Alterations in the epithelial stem cell compartment could contribute to permanent
      changes in the mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 2069-2079
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2016-312609 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: UC is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colonic mucosa. Growing
      evidence supports a role for epithelial cell defects in driving pathology.
      Moreover, long-lasting changes in the epithelial barrier have been reported in
      quiescent UC. Our aim was to investigate whether epithelial cell defects could
      originate from changes in the epithelial compartment imprinted by the disease.
      DESIGN: Epithelial organoid cultures (EpOCs) were expanded ex vivo from the
      intestinal crypts of non-IBD controls and patients with UC. EpOCs were induced to
      differentiate (d-EpOCs), and the total RNA was extracted for microarray and
      quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analyses. Whole intestinal samples were used to
      determine mRNA expression by qPCR, or protein localisation by immunostaining.
      RESULTS: EpOCs from patients with UC maintained self-renewal potential and the
      capability to give rise to differentiated epithelial cell lineages comparable
      with control EpOCs. Nonetheless, a group of genes was differentially regulated in
      the EpOCs and d-EpOCs of patients with UC, including genes associated with
      antimicrobial defence (ie, LYZ, PLA2G2A), with secretory (ie, ZG16, CLCA1) and
      absorptive (ie, AQP8, MUC12) functions, and with a gastric phenotype (ie, ANXA10,
      CLDN18 and LYZ). A high rate of concordance was found in the expression profiles 
      of the organoid cultures and whole colonic tissues from patients with UC.
      CONCLUSIONS: Permanent changes in the colonic epithelium of patients with UC
      could be promoted by alterations imprinted in the stem cell compartment. These
      changes may contribute to perpetuation of the disease.

TI  - Leucine-rich Alpha-2 Glycoprotein is a Serum Biomarker of Mucosal Healing in
      Ulcerative Colitis.
PG  - 84-91
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjw132 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Although several noninvasive and easily accessible
      biomarkers for inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] are available, their sensitivity 
      and specificity are not adequate to be used as single markers and do not overrule
      the need for endoscopic evaluation. We previously reported that serum
      leucine-rich alpha-2 glycoprotein [LRG] was a novel biomarker for rheumatoid
      arthritis and IBD. We herein investigated whether LRG could indicate endoscopic
      activity in patients with ulcerative colitis [UC]. METHODS: Serum LRG
      concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] in
      consecutive 129 patients with UC in two tertiary care hospitals, and associations
      of LRG with clinical and endoscopic activities were evaluated. Clinical activity 
      index [CAI] < 6 was defined as clinical remission, and mucosal healing [MH] and
      complete mucosal healing were defined as Matts' endoscopic grades of 1 or 2 and
      grade of 1, respectively. RESULTS: Serum LRG levels were significantly increased 
      and correlated with clinical and endoscopic activities in patients with UC. LRG
      levels were associated with both clinical and endoscopic activities even in
      patients with normal serum C-reactive protein [CRP] levels. Furthermore, LRG
      levels were significantly lower in patients with complete MH and deep remission. 
      Serial measurements of LRG levels in a subset of patients demonstrated that LRG
      was significantly elevated during the endoscopically active stage compared with
      that during the MH stage. CONCLUSIONS: Serum LRG is a novel biomarker for
      detecting MH during disease course in patients with UC and a surrogate marker of 
      endoscopic inflammation in patients with normal CRP levels.

TI  - The association between the intake of specific dietary components and lifestyle
      factors and microscopic colitis.
PG  - 1309-1317
LID - 10.1038/ejcn.2016.130 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The incidence of microscopic colitis (MC) has increased
      over the previous decades. In addition to smoking and drugs, currently
      unidentified environmental factors may have a role. The aim of this study was to 
      determine whether specific dietary or other lifestyle factors were associated
      with the development of MC. SUBJECT/METHODS: The population-based cohort Malmo
      Diet and Cancer Study of 28 095 individuals was examined. Information about
      dietary habits was collected by a modified diet history method. Data on
      anthropometry were measured, and socio-economic and lifestyle factors were
      collected by questionnaires. Cases of MC were identified in medical registers.
      Associations were estimated using Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: During a
      22-year period, 135 patients were diagnosed with MC. Intakes of protein,
      carbohydrates, sucrose, saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, 
      omega-3 or omega-6 fatty acids, fibre and zinc were not associated with MC. We
      could verify the previously reported association between MC and smoking (hazard
      ratio (HR): 2.29; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.66-3.84) and the female gender 
      (HR: 3.57; 95% CI: 2.22-5.74). High alcohol consumption was associated with an
      increased risk for MC (HR: 1.89 for the highest quartile; 95% CI: 0.82-4.33, P
      for trend=0.032). In a post hoc analysis, alcohol intake including all patients
      independently of consumption seemed to reduce the smoking-related risk.
      CONCLUSIONS: Despite a large cohort and a long follow-up period, we could not
      detect any dietary risk factors for MC. The aetiological mechanisms behind the
      positive impact of smoking and alcohol on MC risk should be investigated.

TI  - Development of an index to define overall disease severity in IBD.
PG  - 244-254
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2016-312648 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Disease activity for Crohn's disease (CD) and UC is typically
      defined based on symptoms at a moment in time, and ignores the long-term burden
      of disease. The aims of this study were to select the attributes determining
      overall disease severity, to rank the importance of and to score these individual
      attributes for both CD and UC. METHODS: Using a modified Delphi panel, 14 members
      of the International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases
      (IOIBD) selected the most important attributes related to IBD. Eighteen IOIBD
      members then completed a statistical exercise (conjoint analysis) to create a
      relative ranking of these attributes. Adjusted utilities were developed by
      creating proportions for each level within an attribute. RESULTS: For CD, 15.8%
      of overall disease severity was attributed to the presence of mucosal lesions,
      10.9% to history of a fistula, 9.7% to history of abscess and 7.4% to history of 
      intestinal resection. For UC, 18.1% of overall disease severity was attributed to
      mucosal lesions, followed by 14.0% for impact on daily activities, 11.2% C
      reactive protein and 10.1% for prior experience with biologics. Overall disease
      severity indices were created on a 100-point scale by applying each attribute's
      average importance to the adjusted utilities. CONCLUSIONS: Based on specialist
      opinion, overall CD severity was associated more with intestinal damage, in
      contrast to overall UC disease severity, which was more dependent on symptoms and
      impact on daily life. Once validated, disease severity indices may provide a
      useful tool for consistent assessment of overall disease severity in patients
      with IBD.

TI  - Interleukin 1beta Mediates Intestinal Inflammation in Mice and Patients With
      Interleukin 10 Receptor Deficiency.
PG  - 1100-1104
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2016.08.055 [doi]
AB  - Interleukin 10 receptor (IL10R)-deficient mice develop spontaneous colitis and,
      similarly, patients with loss-of-function mutations in IL10R develop severe
      infant-onset inflammatory bowel disease. Loss of IL10R signaling in mouse and
      human macrophages is associated with increased production of interleukin 1beta.
      We demonstrated that innate immune production of IL1beta mediates colitis in
      IL10R-deficient mice. Transfer of Il1r1(-/-) CD4(+) T cells into
      Rag1(-/-)/Il10rb(-/-) mice reduced the severity of their colitis (compared to
      mice that received CD4(+) T cells that express IL1R), accompanied by decreased
      production of interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and IL17A. In
      macrophages from mice without disruption of IL10R signaling or from healthy
      humans (controls), incubation with IL10 reduced canonical activation of the
      inflammasome and production of IL1beta through transcriptional and
      post-translational regulation of NLRP3. Lipopolysaccharide and adenosine
      triphosphate stimulation of macrophages from Il10rb(-/-) mice or IL10R-deficient 
      patients resulted in increased production of IL1beta. Moreover, in human
      IL10R-deficient macrophages, lipopolysaccharide stimulation alone triggered
      IL1beta secretion via non-canonical, caspase 8-dependent activation of the
      inflammasome. We treated 2 IL10R-deficient patients with severe and
      treatment-refractory infant-onset inflammatory bowel disease with the
      IL1-receptor antagonist anakinra. Both patients had marked clinical, endoscopic, 
      and histologic responses after 4-7 weeks. This treatment served as successful
      bridge to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in 1 patient. Our
      findings indicate that loss of IL10 signaling leads to intestinal inflammation,
      at least in part, through increased production of IL1 by innate immune cells,
      leading to activation of CD4(+) T cells. Agents that block IL1 signaling might be
      used to treat patients with inflammatory bowel disease resulting from IL10R
      deficiency.

TI  - Long-Term Disease Course and Pregnancy Outcomes in Women with Inflammatory Bowel 
      Disease: An Indian Cohort Study.
PG  - 2054-2062
LID - 10.1007/s10620-016-4353-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The literature on interaction between pregnancy and inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) is inconsistent, and there are no reports on this aspect from
      Asia. This study evaluated the impact both IBD and pregnancy have on each other
      in a large cohort of Indian patients. METHODS: In total, 514 females with
      ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) aged between 18 and 45 years
      attending IBD clinic, at our institute, from July 2004 to July 2013 were
      screened, and patients with data on pregnancy status were included (n = 406).
      Pregnancies were categorized as either before, after or coinciding with disease
      onset. Long-term disease course was ascertained from prospectively maintained
      records. Pregnancy and fetal outcomes were recorded from antenatal records or
      individual interviews. RESULTS: Of 406 patients (UC: 336, CD: 70), 310 became
      pregnant (UC: 256, CD: 54), with a total of 597 pregnancies (UC: 524, CD: 73).
      More UC patients with pregnancies were in long-term remission than non-pregnant
      patients (56.7 vs. 43.4 %, p = 0.04). Long-term remission was less frequent in UC
      patients in whom pregnancy coincided with disease onset than patients with
      pregnancies before and after/pregnancy after the disease onset (41.4 vs. 62.5 %, 
      p = 0.023). Pregnancies after the disease onset were associated with more
      cesarean sections and adverse fetal outcomes than pregnancies before disease
      onset in both UC and CD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term disease course in UC
      patients was better in pregnant as compared to non-pregnant patients. Among
      pregnant UC patients, disease course was worst when pregnancy coincided with
      disease onset. Pregnancy and fetal outcomes were worse in pregnancy after disease
      onset than pregnancy before disease onset.

TI  - Coordinated Hospital-Home Fecal Microbiota Transplantation via Percutaneous
      Endoscopic Cecostomy for Recurrent Steroid-Dependent Ulcerative Colitis.
PG  - 975-980
LID - 10.5009/gnl15456 [doi]
AB  - Since its introduction as an alternative intestinal microbiota alteration
      approach, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been increasingly used as a 
      treatment of choice for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), but no reports
      exist regarding FMT via percutaneous endoscopic cecostomy (PEC). This report
      describes the case of a 24-year-old man with a 7-year history of recurrent,
      steroid-dependent UC. He received FMT via PEC once per day for 1 month in the
      hospital. After the remission of gastrointestinal symptoms, he was discharged
      from the hospital and continued FMT via PEC twice per week for 3 months at home. 
      The frequency of stools decreased, and the characteristics of stools improved
      soon thereafter. Enteral nutrition was regained after 1 week, and an oral diet
      was begun 1 month later. Two months after the FMT end point, the patient resumed 
      a normal diet, with formed soft stools once per day. The follow-up colonoscopy
      showed normal mucus membranes; then, the PEC set was removed. On the subsequent
      12 months follow-up, the patient resumed orthobiosis without any gastrointestinal
      discomfort and returned to work. This case emphasizes that FMT via PEC can not
      only induce remission but also shorten the duration of hospitalization and reduce
      the medical costs; therefore, this approach should be considered an alternative
      option for patients with UC.

AB  - Existing therapies for inflammatory bowel disease that are based on broad
      suppression of inflammation result in variable clinical benefit and unwanted side
      effects. A potential therapeutic approach for promoting immune tolerance is the
      in vivo induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Here we report that activation
      of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor using the non-toxic agonist
      2-(1'H-indole-3'-carbonyl)-thiazole-4-carboxylic acid methyl ester (ITE) induces 
      human Tregs in vitro that suppress effector T cells through a mechanism mediated 
      by CD39 and Granzyme B. We then developed a humanized murine system whereby human
      CD4(+) T cells drive colitis upon exposure to 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid 
      and assessed ITE as a potential therapeutic. ITE administration ameliorated
      colitis in humanized mice with increased CD39, Granzyme B, and IL10-secreting
      human Tregs. These results develop an experimental model to investigate human
      CD4(+) T responses in vivo and identify the non-toxic AHR agonist ITE as a
      potential therapy for promoting immune tolerance in the intestine.

TI  - The L-Arginine Transporter Solute Carrier Family 7 Member 2 Mediates the
      Immunopathogenesis of Attaching and Effacing Bacteria.
PG  - e1005984
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005984 [doi]
AB  - Solute carrier family 7 member 2 (SLC7A2) is an inducible transporter of the
      semi-essential amino acid L-arginine (L-Arg), which has been implicated in immune
      responses to pathogens. We assessed the role of SLC7A2 in murine infection with
      Citrobacter rodentium, an attaching and effacing enteric pathogen that causes
      colitis. Induction of SLC7A2 was upregulated in colitis tissues, and localized
      predominantly to colonic epithelial cells. Compared to wild-type mice,
      Slc7a2-/-mice infected with C. rodentium had improved survival and decreased
      weight loss, colon weight, and histologic injury; this was associated with
      decreased colonic macrophages, dendritic cells, granulocytes, and Th1 and Th17
      cells. In infected Slc7a2-/-mice, there were decreased levels of the
      proinflammatory cytokines G-CSF, TNF-alpha, IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, and the
      chemokines CXCL1, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CXCL2, and CCL5. In bone marrow chimeras, the
      recipient genotype drove the colitis phenotype, indicative of the importance of
      epithelial, rather than myeloid SLC7A2. Mice lacking Slc7a2 exhibited reduced
      adherence of C. rodentium to the colonic epithelium and decreased expression of
      Talin-1, a focal adhesion protein involved in the attachment of the bacterium.
      The importance of SLC7A2 and Talin-1 in the intimate attachment of C. rodentium
      and induction of inflammatory response was confirmed in vitro, using
      conditionally-immortalized young adult mouse colon (YAMC) cells with shRNA
      knockdown of Slc7a2 or Tln1. Inhibition of L-Arg uptake with the competitive
      inhibitor, L-lysine (L-Lys), also prevented attachment of C. rodentium and
      chemokine expression. L-Lys and siRNA knockdown confirmed the role of L-Arg and
      SLC7A2 in human Caco-2 cells co-cultured with enteropathogenic Escherichia coli. 
      Overexpression of SLC7A2 in human embryonic kidney cells increased bacterial
      adherence and chemokine expression. Taken together, our data indicate that C.
      rodentium enhances its own pathogenicity by inducing the expression of SLC7A2 to 
      favor its attachment to the epithelium and thus create its ecological niche.

TI  - Autonomic nervous system function predicts the inflammatory response over three
      years in newly diagnosed ulcerative colitis patients.
PG  - 1655-1662
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12865 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The autonomic nervous system (ANS) modulates intestinal inflammation 
      in animal models. Human evidence confirming such modulating influence is limited.
      We aimed to investigate whether ANS function is associated with inflammatory
      parameters at disease onset, and whether it predicts the evolution of
      inflammation in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: We prospectively 
      monitored 51 patients from onset of UC for 3 years. Upon remission of the onset
      flare, ANS activity was assessed by heart rate variability analysis and compared 
      with healthy controls. Inflammatory parameters in blood, stool, and colonic
      biopsies obtained at onset and during follow-up visits were analyzed. Generalized
      linear models were used to test cross-sectional associations between ANS activity
      and inflammatory parameters at onset; linear mixed models were used to test
      whether ANS function at onset predicted the evolution of inflammation over the
      following 3 years. KEY RESULTS: Sympathovagal balance was different in UC
      patients compared to healthy controls, and cross-sectional associated with higher
      levels of systemic (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], CRP, TNF-alpha,
      IFN-gamma) and mucosal inflammation (interleukin-8, IFN-gamma) at onset.
      Conversely, a negative cross-sectional association with parasympathetic activity 
      was found for ESR & TNF-alpha. Longitudinally, parasympathetic activity at onset 
      predicted systemic (ESR, WBC), but not mucosal inflammation during follow-up.
      CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: This study further strengthens the association between 
      the ANS system and intestinal inflammation previously found in animal models and 
      recently in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. These results may have
      important implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of UC.

TI  - Reflections About Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Vitamins A and D.
PG  - 1105-1110
AB  - Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are two major forms of the inflammatory
      bowel diseases (IBDs). Vitamin A (VA) and vitamin D (VD) may be associated with
      reduction in inflammation in these disorders. The aim of this review was to show 
      the current evidence that may associate VA and VD with IBDs. Data linking VA, VD,
      and IBDs were studied. Both VA and VD may be related to the immune system in
      different manners. The active form of VA, retinoic acid, may be related to the
      growth factor-beta and release of interleukin-10 (IL-10), thus involved with the 
      resolution of the inflammation. Its deficiency is associated with the increase of
      disease activity. The active form of VD is 1,25(OH)2D3 that produces biological
      effects via the nuclear hormone receptor named VD receptor (VDR), which may
      interfere with the immune cells and macrophages leading to the suppression of the
      inflammatory process by decreasing the release of TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-6, and
      IL-8, IL-12, and IL-23. VDR may also activate nucleotide-binding oligomerization 
      domain 2 expression and stimulate the production of the defensin and cathelicidin
      that are important to the homeostasis of the mucosal immune barrier. The use of
      VA and VD could be helpful in the treatment and prevention of IBDs but more
      studies are necessary to establish the precise role of these compounds in the
      prevention or remission of these inflammatory processes.

TI  - Is Modern Medical Management Changing Ultimate Patient Outcomes in Inflammatory
      Bowel Disease?
PG  - 1867-1873
AB  - BACKGROUND: The impact of modern medical management of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) on surgical necessity and outcomes remains unclear. We hypothesized that
      surgery rates have decreased while outcomes have worsened due to operating on
      "sicker" patients since the introduction of biologic medications. METHODS: The
      Nationwide Inpatient Sample and ICD-9-CM codes were used to identify inpatient
      admissions for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Trends in IBD nutrition,
      surgeries, and postoperative complications were determined. RESULTS: There were
      191,743 admissions for IBD during the study period. Surgery rates were largely
      unchanged over the study period, ranging from 9 to 12 % of admissions in both
      Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The rate of poor nutrition increased by
      67 % in ulcerative colitis and by 83 % in Crohn's disease. Rates of postoperative
      anastomotic leak (10.2-13.9 %) were unchanged over the years. Postoperative
      infection rates decreased by 17 % in Crohn's disease (18 % in 2003 to 15 % in
      2012; P < 0.001) but did not show a trend in any direction in ulcerative colitis.
      CONCLUSIONS: Rates of IBD surgery have remained stable while postoperative
      infectious complications have remained stable or decreased since the
      implementation of biologic therapies. We identified an increase in poor nutrition
      in surgical patients.

TI  - Acute severe ulcerative colitis: from pathophysiology to clinical management.
PG  - 654-664
LID - 10.1038/nrgastro.2016.116 [doi]
AB  - Ulcerative colitis is a common chronic inflammatory disease of the colon and
      rectum, resulting from a dysregulated immune response towards intraluminal
      antigens in a genetically predisposed host. The disease has a varying extent and 
      severity. Approximately 20% of patients with ulcerative colitis experience a
      severe flare during the course of their disease, requiring hospitalization. Acute
      severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) is potentially a life-threatening condition that
      requires early recognition, hospitalization, correction of body fluids and
      electrolytes, and nutritional support if needed. Superimposed bacterial or viral 
      infections need to be excluded and thromboprophylaxis should be started.
      Intravenous corticosteroids are the first-line treatment for this condition.
      Rescue treatment with ciclosporin or infliximab is indicated in patients who do
      not sufficiently respond to corticosteroids after 3-5 days, with close monitoring
      of the patients' symptoms, serum C-reactive protein and albumin levels. If
      medical therapy fails, timely colectomy should be performed to prevent critical
      complications. In this article, we review all relevant aspects of ASUC, from its 
      pathophysiological background to modern management in clinical practice.

AB  - Complementary or alternative medicine is of great interest for the treatment of
      inflammatory bowel disease, with the aim of ameliorating the side effects of the 
      drugs commonly used or improving their efficacy. In this study, we evaluated the 
      ability of goat whey to prevent intestinal inflammation in the experimental model
      of acetic acid-induced rats and compared it to sulfasalazine. Pretreatment with
      goat whey (1, 2, and 4g/kg) and sulfasalazine (250mg/kg) on colitic rats improved
      colonic inflammatory markers, including myeloperoxidase activity, leukotriene B4 
      levels, as well as the production of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and tumor
      necrosis factor-alpha. Furthermore, the administration of goat whey significantly
      reduced the colonic oxidative stress by reducing malondialdehyde levels and
      increased total glutathione content, a potent antioxidant peptide. The
      histological evaluation of the colonic specimens from colitic rats confirmed
      these beneficial effects, as goat whey preserved the colonic tissue, especially
      in those rats treated with the highest dose of goat whey or with sulfasalazine.
      The immunohistochemistry analysis of the colonic tissue evaluation also revealed 
      a reduction in the expression of cyclooxygenase-2, inducible nitric oxide
      synthase, and matrix metalloproteinase-9, together with an increased expression
      of suppressor of cytokine signaling-1. These results suggest that goat whey
      exerted a preventive effect against the intestinal damage induced by acetic acid,
      showing a similar efficacy to that shown by sulfasalazine, therefore making it a 
      potential treatment for human inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - A Putative Blood-Based Biomarker for Autism Spectrum Disorder-Associated
      Ileocolitis.
PG  - 35820
LID - 10.1038/srep35820 [doi]
AB  - Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in children with autism spectrum disorder
      (ASD). A significant proportion of children with ASD and gastrointestinal
      symptoms have histologic evidence of ileocolitis (inflammation of the terminal
      ileum and/or colon). We previously reported the molecular characterization of
      gastrointestinal biopsy tissue from ASD children with ileocolitis (ASD(IC+))
      compared to anatomically similar inflamed tissue from typically developing
      children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; i.e. Crohn's disease or ulcerative
      colitis) and typically developing children with gastrointestinal symptoms but no 
      evidence of gastrointestinal mucosal inflammation (TD(IC-)). ASD(IC+) children
      had a gene expression profile that, while primarily overlapping with known IBD,
      had distinctive differences. The present study confirms these findings and
      replicates this molecular characterization in a second cohort of cases (ASD(IC+))
      and controls (TD(IC-)). In these two separate case/control mucosal-based cohorts,
      we have demonstrated overlap of 59 differentially expressed transcripts (DETs)
      unique to inflamed ileocolonic tissue from symptomatic ASD(IC+) children. We now 
      report that 9 of these 59 transcripts are also differentially expressed in the
      peripheral blood of the second cohort of ASD(IC+) children. This set of
      transcripts represents a putative blood-based biomarker for ASD-associated
      ileocolonic inflammation.

TI  - Serologic Anti-GP2 Antibodies Are Associated with Genetic Polymorphisms,
      Fibrostenosis, and Need for Surgical Resection in Crohn's Disease.
PG  - 2648-2657
AB  - BACKGROUND: The presentation of Crohn's disease (CD) is heterogeneous and often
      leads to serious complications and need for surgery. We tested serum anti-zymogen
      granule glycoprotein 2 (GP2) antibodies, including its novel isoform alpha, for
      association with genetic variants, diagnosis, disease stratification, and
      prediction of CD courses in a combined cross-sectional and cohort study. METHODS:
      Serum samples of 303 CD, 108 ulcerative colitis, 72 other inflammatory
      gastrointestinal diseases, and 206 controls without predominant gastrointestinal 
      diseases controls (HC) were tested for the presence of Anti-GP2 and
      Anti-Saccharomyces cervisiae (ASCA) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Genetic
      analysis was performed using the Illumina Immunochip. RESULTS: GP2 IgA and IgG
      had the highest discriminatory capability for CD versus ulcerative colitis and CD
      versus inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases. We identified an association of
      GP2 IgA and IgG each with 5 distinct single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Levels of
      anti-GP2 IgG were moderately associated with ileal disease location.
      Interestingly, both, anti-GP2 IgA and IgG were exclusively associated with the
      occurrence of stenosis and need for surgery, independently of disease location,
      but not with fistulizing CD, early disease onset or disease activity. ASCA IgG
      and IgA were qualitatively and quantitatively linked to CD, CD complications, and
      need for surgery. Increased levels of ASCA IgG and IgA and positivity for ASCA
      IgG, but neither levels nor positivity for GP2 IgG or IgA were predictive of the 
      earlier occurrence of complications or surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-GP2 antibodies 
      may aid as a tool for diagnosis and differentiation of CD and could indicate a
      more complicated CD course.

TI  - Patients Perceive Clinical Benefit with the Specific Carbohydrate Diet for
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
PG  - 3255-3260
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that dietary therapy may be effective for
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but limited published data exist 
      on the usage and efficacy of dietary therapy. AIM: To evaluate the perspective of
      IBD patients using the specific carbohydrate diet (SCD). METHODS: An anonymous
      online survey was conducted using REDCap, a Web-based survey tool. Survey links
      were sent to known Web sites as well as support groups in an attempt to
      characterize patient utilization of the SCD and perception of efficacy of the
      SCD. RESULTS: There were 417 respondents of the online survey on the SCD with
      IBD. Mean age for individuals on the SCD was 34.9 +/- 16.4 years. Seventy percent
      were female. Forty-seven percent had Crohn's disease, 43 % had ulcerative
      colitis, and 10 % had indeterminate colitis. Individuals perceived clinical
      improvement on the SCD. Four percent reported clinical remission prior to the
      SCD, while 33 % reported remission at 2 months after initiation of the SCD, and
      42 % at both 6 and 12 months. For those reporting clinical remission, 13 %
      reported time to achieve remission of less than 2 weeks, 17 % reported 2 weeks to
      a month, 36 % reported 1-3 months, and 34 % reported greater than 3 months. For
      individuals who reported reaching remission, 47 % of individuals reported
      associated improvement in abnormal laboratory values. CONCLUSIONS: The SCD is
      utilized by many patients as a primary and adjunct therapy for IBD. Most patients
      perceive clinical benefit to use of the SCD.

TI  - IBS-like Symptoms in Patients with Ulcerative Colitis in Deep Remission Are
      Associated with Increased Levels of Serum Cytokines and Poor Psychological
      Well-being.
PG  - 2630-2640
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal symptoms (GI) compatible with irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) are common in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) in remission. 
      The causes of these symptoms remain to be clarified. Our aim was to investigate
      prevalence and factors associated with IBS-like symptoms in patients with UC in
      deep remission. METHODS: We included 298 patients with UC and used Mayo score,
      sigmoidoscopy, and fecal calprotectin to define deep remission versus active
      disease. Presence of IBS-like symptoms according to the Rome III criteria,
      severity of GI, extraintestinal and psychological symptoms, stress levels, and
      quality of life were measured with validated questionnaires. Serum cytokines and 
      high-sensitive C-reactive peptide were determined. RESULTS: The criteria for deep
      remission was fulfilled by 132 patients (44%) and 24 of these fulfilled the Rome 
      III criteria for IBS (18%). Patients with UC in deep remission with IBS-like
      symptoms had comparable levels of GI symptoms, non-GI somatic symptoms, and
      quality of life as patients with active UC. The patients with UC in deep
      remission with IBS-like symptoms had similar levels of fecal calprotectin as
      patients in deep remission without IBS-like symptoms (18 versus 31 mug/g, P =
      0.11), but higher levels of serum cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1beta, IL-6, IL-13,
      IL-10 and IL-8, P < 0.05) and higher levels of anxiety (P < 0.001), depression (P
      = 0.02) and perceived stress (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: IBS-like symptoms in
      patients with UC in deep remission are common, but not as prevalent as previously
      reported. Poor psychological well-being and increased serum cytokine levels, but 
      not colonic low-grade inflammation, were associated with IBS-like symptoms.

TI  - Development of an Inflammatory Bowel Disease Research Registry Derived from
      Observational Electronic Health Record Data for Comprehensive Clinical
      Phenotyping.
PG  - 3236-3245
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a heterogeneous collection of
      chronic inflammatory disorders of the digestive tract. Clinical, genetic, and
      pathological heterogeneity makes it increasingly difficult to translate efficacy 
      studies into real-world practice. Our objective was to develop a comprehensive
      natural history registry derived from multi-year observational data to facilitate
      effectiveness and clinical phenotypic research in IBD. METHODS: A longitudinal,
      consented registry with prospectively collected data was developed at UPMC. All
      adult IBD patients receiving care at the tertiary care center of UPMC are
      eligible for enrollment. Detailed data in the electronic health record are
      accessible for registry research purposes. Data are exported directly from the
      electronic health record and temporally organized for research. RESULTS: To date,
      there are over 2565 patients participating in the IBD research registry. All
      patients have demographic data, clinical disease characteristics, and disease
      course data including healthcare utilization, laboratory values, health-related
      questionnaires quantifying disease activity and quality of life, and analytical
      information on treatment, temporally organized for 6 years (2009-2015). The data 
      have resulted in a detailed definition of clinical phenotypes suitable for
      association studies with parameters of disease outcomes and treatment response.
      We have established the infrastructure required to examine the effectiveness of
      treatment and disease course in the real-world setting of IBD. CONCLUSIONS: The
      IBD research registry offers a unique opportunity to investigate clinical
      research questions regarding the natural course of the disease, phenotype
      association studies, effectiveness of treatment, and quality of care research.

      Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Phase 3 trials have shown the efficacy of vedolizumab, which
      binds to integrin alpha4beta7, in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) or
      ulcerative colitis (UC). We investigated the effectiveness and safety of
      vedolizumab in patients who failed anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy. METHODS:
      From June through December 2014, there were 173 patients with CD and 121 patients
      with UC who were included in a multicenter nominative compassionate early access 
      program granted by French regulatory agencies. This program provided patients
      with access to vedolizumab before it was authorized for marketing. Vedolizumab
      (300 mg) was administered intravenously at weeks 0, 2, and 6, and then every 8
      weeks. Disease activity was assessed using the Harvey-Bradshaw Index for CD and
      the partial Mayo Clinic score for UC. We report results obtained after the
      14-week induction phase. RESULTS: Among the 294 patients treated with vedolizumab
      (mean age, 39.5 +/- 14.0 y; mean disease duration, 10.8 +/- 7.6 y; concomitant
      steroids, 44% of cases), 276 completed the induction period, however, 18
      discontinued vedolizumab because of a lack of response (n = 14), infusion-related
      reaction (n = 2), or infections (n = 2). At week 14, 31% of patients with CD were
      in steroid-free clinical remission and 51% had a response; among patients with
      UC, 36% were in steroid-free clinical remission and 50% had a response. No deaths
      were reported. Severe adverse events occurred in 24 patients (8.2%), including 15
      (5.1%) that led to vedolizumab discontinuation (1 case of pulmonary tuberculosis 
      and 1 rectal adenocarcinoma). CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of patients with CD or UC 
      who failed previous anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy, approximately one third
      of patients achieved steroid-free clinical remission after 14 weeks of induction 
      therapy with vedolizumab. This agent had an acceptable safety profile in these
      patients.

TI  - Gastrointestinal Symptoms Predictors of Health-Related Quality of Life in
      Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
PG  - e186-e192
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate the multidimensional
      gastrointestinal symptoms predictors of generic health-related quality of life
      (HRQOL) in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease from the
      perspectives of pediatric patients and parents. METHODS: The Pediatric Quality of
      Life Inventory Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales and Pediatric Quality of Life
      Inventory 4.0 Generic Core Scales were completed in a 9-site study by 260
      families of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Gastrointestinal Symptoms
      Scales measuring stomach pain, food and drink limits, gas and bloating,
      constipation, blood in stool, and diarrhea were identified as clinically
      important symptom differentiators from healthy controls based on prior findings, 
      and subsequently tested for bivariate and multivariate linear associations with
      overall HRQOL (Generic Core Scales). RESULTS: Stomach pain, food and drink
      limits, gas and bloating, constipation, blood in stool, and diarrhea were
      significantly associated with decreased HRQOL in bivariate analyses (P < 0.001). 
      In predictive models utilizing hierarchical multiple regression analyses
      controlling for age, sex, and race/ethnicity, gastrointestinal symptoms accounted
      for an additional 40% of the variance in patient self-reported HRQOL (P < 0.001) 
      and 37% of the variance in parent proxy-reported HRQOL (P < 0.001), reflecting
      large effect sizes. Stomach pain, food and drink limits, and constipation were
      significant individual patient-reported predictors after controlling for the
      other gastrointestinal symptoms in the predictive models. CONCLUSIONS:
      Patient-reported gastrointestinal symptoms differentially predicted HRQOL.
      Identifying the specific gastrointestinal symptoms from a standardized
      multidimensional gastrointestinal symptoms profile that are the most important
      predictors from the patient perspective facilitates a patient-centered approach
      for interventions designed to ameliorate impaired HRQOL.

TI  - Loss of interleukin 33 expression in colonic crypts - a potential marker for
      disease remission in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 35403
LID - 10.1038/srep35403 [doi]
AB  - Interleukin 33 (IL-33) is a cytokine preferentially elevated in acute ulcerative 
      colitis (UC), inferring a role in its pathogenesis. The role of IL-33 in
      intestinal inflammation is incompletely understood, with both pro-inflammatory
      and regulatory properties described. There are also conflicting reports on
      cellular sources and subcellular location of IL-33 in the colonic mucosa,
      justifying a closer look at IL-33 expression in well-defined clinical stages of
      UC. A total of 50 study participants (29 UC patients and 21 healthy controls)
      were included from a prospective cohort of inflammatory bowel disease patients
      treated to disease remission with infliximab, a tumour necrosis factor alpha
      (TNF) inhibitor. To our knowledge this is the first study examining mucosal IL-33
      expression before and after anti-TNF therapy. In colonic mucosal biopsies we
      found a 3-fold increase in IL-33 gene expression comparing acute UC to healthy
      controls (p < 0.01). A significant reduction of IL33 between acute UC and disease
      remission was observed when TNF normalised in the mucosa (p = 0.02).
      Immunostaining revealed IL-33 in the nuclei of epithelial cells of scattered
      colonic crypts in acute disease, while at disease remission, IL-33 was
      undetectable, a novel finding suggesting that enterocyte-derived IL-33 is induced
      and maintained by inflammatory mediators.

      questions to be answered.
PG  - 800-810
LID - 10.1111/1751-2980.12422 [doi]
AB  - Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) exhibit impaired control of the
      microbiome in the gut, and 'dysbiosis' is commonly observed. Western diet is a
      risk factor for the development of IBD, but it may have different effects on gut 
      microbiota between IBD and non-IBD individuals. Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN)
      can induce remission in pediatric Crohn's disease with a decrease in gut
      microbial diversity. Although there are some theoretical benefits, actual
      treatment effects of prebiotics and probiotics in IBD vary. High-quality studies 
      have shown that VSL#3 (a high-potency probiotic medical food containing eight
      different strains) exhibits benefits in treating ulcerative colitis, and gut
      microbial diversity is reduced after treated with VSL#3 in animal models. The
      effect of fecal microbiome transplantation on IBD is controversial. Increasing
      microbial diversity compared with impaired handling of bacteria presents a
      dilemma. Antibiotics are the strongest factors in the reduction of microbiome
      ecological diversity. Some antibiotics may help to induce remission of the
      disease. Microbiome alteration has been suggested to be an intrinsic property of 
      IBD and a potential predictor in diagnosis and prognosis. However, the effects of
      therapeutic modulations are variable; thus, more questions remain to be answered.

AB  - In the last 10 years, we have learned much about the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and
      management of intestinal fibrosis in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.
      Just a decade ago, intestinal strictures were considered to be an inevitable
      consequence of long-term inflammation in patients who did not respond to
      anti-inflammatory therapies. Inflammatory bowel diseases-associated fibrosis was 
      seen as an irreversible process that frequently led to intestinal obstructions
      requiring surgical intervention. This paradigm has changed rapidly, due to the
      antifibrotic approaches that may become available. We review the mechanisms and
      diagnosis of this serious complication of inflammatory bowel diseases, as well as
      factors that predict its progression and management strategies.

TI  - ALLERGIC PROCTOCOLITIS IN INFANTS: analysis of the evolution of the nutritional
      status.

AB  - Background: Allergic proctocolitis is a disease that affects infants in the first
      months. The change in feed is the primary factor for clinical improvement and
      maintenance of the nutritional status of the infant. Objective: Study the
      anthropometric evolution of infants with allergic proctocolitis at diagnosis and 
      1 to 6 months after nutritional intervention. Methods: A retrospective cohort of 
      infants with allergic proctocolitis diagnosis followed at the Pediatric
      Gastroenterology Institute of Sao Paulo (IGASTROPED), Brazil. The database with
      clinical, therapeutic and anthropometric data was obtained from medical records
      of outpatient infants. The therapeutic intervention was characterized by 1)
      exclusive breastfeeding with maternal exclusion diet of the six allergens
      (EBF-MED) or 2) no breastfeeding and use of hypoallergenic formulas. Results: Of 
      the 44 infants diagnosed with allergic proctocolitis, 23 were female. The median 
      age of the infants was 3.5 months at the time of admission and 6 months after the
      intervention. The main clinical complaint was hematochezia with or without other 
      symptoms of allergic proctocolitis. No difference was shown in the infants
      anthropometric evaluation between the two diets. Conclusion: The duration of the 
      allergic proctocolitis did not induce worsening of the infants nutritional
      status. Importantly, both nutritional interventions were able to keep the infants
      within the growth channel and resulted in the total clinical symptoms remission. 
      Considering the fundamental mother-child link promoted by breastfeeding, the
      present data highlights the beneficial role of EBF-MED on the nutritional status 
      of infants diagnosed with allergic proctocolitis in addition to the lower cost
      that breastfeeding brings compared the use of hypoallergenic formulas.

TI  - Lycopene, Lutein and Zeaxanthin May Reduce Faecal Blood, Mucus and Pus but not
      Abdominal Pain in Individuals with Ulcerative Colitis.
LID - E613 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The main symptom of ulcerative colitis is diarrhoea, which is often
      accompanied by painful tenesmus and faecal blood and mucus. It sometimes
      co-occurs with abdominal pain, fever, feeling of fatigue, loss of appetite and
      weight loss. Some dietary factors have been indicated as important in the
      treatment of ulcerative colitis. The aim of the study was to analyse the
      association between retinoid intake (total vitamin A, retinol, beta-carotene,
      alpha-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, lutein and zeaxanthin) and
      ulcerative colitis symptoms (abdominal pain, faecal blood, faecal mucus, faecal
      pus) in individuals with ulcerative colitis in remission. METHODS: Assessment of 
      diet was based on self-reported data from each patient's dietary records taken
      over a period of three typical, random days (2 weekdays and 1 day of the
      weekend). RESULTS: A total of 56 individuals with ulcerative colitis in remission
      (19 males and 37 females) were recruited for the study. One in every four
      individuals with ulcerative colitis in remission was characterised as having
      inadequate vitamin A intake. Higher lycopene, lutein and zeaxanthin intakes in
      individuals with ulcerative colitis in remission were associated with lower
      faecal blood, mucus and pus but not with lower incidence of abdominal pain.
      Higher carotene intake in individuals with ulcerative colitis in remission may
      contribute to higher incidence of faecal mucus. CONCLUSIONS: Optimising intake of
      specific retinoids may enhance disease control in individuals with ulcerative
      colitis. Prospective studies, including patient reported and objective outcomes, 
      are required to confirm this.

TI  - Prolonged fibroblast growth factor 19 response in patients with primary
      sclerosing cholangitis after an oral chenodeoxycholic acid challenge.
PG  - 132-140

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bile salts likely contribute to liver injury in patients with primary
      sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). Fibroblast
      growth factor 19 (FGF19) is a bile salt-induced enterokine with hepatoprotective 
      potential as it suppresses de novo bile salt synthesis. Here, we evaluated the
      bile salt receptor FXR/FGF19 gut-liver axis in PSC and PBC patients. METHODS:
      Fasted patients with PSC (n = 12) and PBC (n = 10), and healthy controls (HC; n =
      10) were orally challenged with the natural FXR agonist chenodeoxycholic acid
      (CDCA 15 mg/kg). Blood was sampled hourly until 8 h afterwards. Serum FGF19 and
      bile salt excursions were determined. Serum levels of
      7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4), reflecting bile salt synthesis, were
      measured as a biomarker of FGF19 response. RESULTS: Baseline serum FGF19 levels
      were comparable between groups, while fasted bile salt levels in PSC patients
      were elevated. Upon CDCA challenge, HC and PBC patients showed a serum FGF19 peak
      after 4 h followed by a decline. PSC patients showed a prolonged and elevated
      serum FGF19 response up to 8 h, combined with a sustained serum elevation of CDCA
      and other bile salts. In general, C4 levels declined following FGF19 elevation.
      In PSC patients with less favorable prognosis, baseline C4 levels were
      drastically suppressed and did not further decline. CONCLUSION: Following an oral
      CDCA challenge, PSC patients showed an impaired clearance of CDCA and a prolonged
      serum FGF19 response. FXR agonist therapy in PSC could cause prolonged exposure
      to elevated levels of FGF19, and we propose careful monitoring for detrimental
      side effects in patient studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) ulcerative colitis (UC) 
      and Crohn's disease (CD) cause significant morbidity and are increasing in
      prevalence among all populations, including African Americans. More than 200
      susceptibility loci have been identified in populations of predominantly European
      ancestry, but few loci have been associated with IBD in other ethnicities.
      METHODS: We performed 2 high-density, genome-wide scans comprising 2345 cases of 
      African Americans with IBD (1646 with CD, 583 with UC, and 116 inflammatory bowel
      disease unclassified) and 5002 individuals without IBD (controls, identified from
      the Health Retirement Study and Kaiser Permanente database). Single-nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) associated at P < 5.0 x 10(-8) in meta-analysis with a
      nominal evidence (P < .05) in each scan were considered to have genome-wide
      significance. RESULTS: We detected SNPs at HLA-DRB1, and African-specific SNPs at
      ZNF649 and LSAMP, with associations of genome-wide significance for UC. We
      detected SNPs at USP25 with associations of genome-wide significance for IBD. No 
      associations of genome-wide significance were detected for CD. In addition, 9
      genes previously associated with IBD contained SNPs with significant evidence for
      replication (P < 1.6 x 10(-6)): ADCY3, CXCR6, HLA-DRB1 to HLA-DQA1 (genome-wide
      significance on conditioning), IL12B,PTGER4, and TNC for IBD; IL23R, PTGER4, and 
      SNX20 (in strong linkage disequilibrium with NOD2) for CD; and KCNQ2 (near
      TNFRSF6B) for UC. Several of these genes, such as TNC (near TNFSF15), CXCR6, and 
      genes associated with IBD at the HLA locus, contained SNPs with unique
      association patterns with African-specific alleles. CONCLUSIONS: We performed a
      genome-wide association study of African Americans with IBD and identified loci
      associated with UC in only this population; we also replicated IBD, CD, and UC
      loci identified in European populations. The detection of variants associated
      with IBD risk in only people of African descent demonstrates the importance of
      studying the genetics of IBD and other complex diseases in populations beyond
      those of European ancestry.

      A review article.
PG  - 7727-34
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i34.7727 [doi]
AB  - Emerging data have highlighted the co-existence of non-alcoholic fatty liver
      disease (NAFLD) and inflammatory bowel disease; both of which are increasingly
      prevalent disorders with significant complications and impact on future health
      burden. Cross-section observational studies have shown widely variable prevalence
      rates of co-existing disease, largely due to differences in disease definition
      and diagnostic tools utilised in the studies. Age, obesity, insulin resistance
      and other metabolic conditions are common risks factors in observational studies.
      However, other studies have also suggested a more dominant role of inflammatory
      bowel disease related factors such as disease activity, duration, steroid use and
      prior surgical intervention, in the development of NAFLD. This suggests a
      potentially more complex pathogenesis and relationship between the two diseases
      which may be contributed by factors including altered intestinal permeability,
      gut dysbiosis and chronic inflammatory response. Commonly used immunomodulation
      agents pose potential hepatic toxicity, however no definitive evidence exist
      linking them to the development of hepatic steatosis, nor are there any data on
      the impact of therapy and prognosis in patient with co-existent diseases. Further
      studies are required to assess the impact and establish appropriate screening and
      management strategies in order to allow early identification, intervention and
      improve patient outcomes.

TI  - Preventive health measures in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 7625-44
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i34.7625 [doi]
AB  - We aim to review the literature and provide guidance on preventive health
      measures in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Structured searches were performed 
      in PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Library from January 1976
      to June 2016 using the following keywords: (inflammatory bowel disease OR Crohn's
      disease OR ulcerative colitis) AND (health maintenance OR preventive health OR
      health promotion). Abstracts of the articles selected from each of these multiple
      searches were reviewed, and those meeting the inclusion criteria (that is,
      providing data regarding preventive health or health maintenance in IBD patients)
      were recorded. Reference lists from the selected articles were manually reviewed 
      to identify further relevant studies. Patients with IBD are at increased risk of 
      developing adverse events related to the disease course, therapeutic
      interventions, or non-adherence to medication. Recent studies have suggested that
      IBD patients do not receive preventive services with the same thoroughness as
      patients with other chronic diseases. Preventive health measures can avert
      morbidity and improve the quality of life of patients with IBD.
      Gastroenterologists and primary care physicians (PCPs) should have an up to date 
      working knowledge of preventive health measures for IBD patients. A holistic
      approach and better communication between gastroenterologists and PCPs with
      explicit clarification of roles will prevent duplication of services and
      streamline care.

TI  - Bone status assessed by quantitative ultrasound in children with inflammatory
      bowel disease: a comparison with DXA.
PG  - 1305-1312
AB  - BACKGROUND: To determine the bone status in children with inflammatory bowel
      diseases (IBD) using quantitative ultrasound (QUS) measurement at hand phalanges 
      and compare the obtained results with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).
      METHODS: Fifty-one children with IBD underwent DXA and QUS measurements at hand
      phalanges in the year 2013. The control group for the QUS consisted of 460
      children. Reference data for DXA comes from Hologic Explorer. RESULTS: QUS
      measurements did not differ significantly between IBD patients and healthy
      controls. There was no difference between UC and CD subjects. DXA measurements in
      patients with IBD were lower than in the healthy population. Tanner stage and
      nutritional status correlated with bone status contrary to steroids therapy.
      CONCLUSION: Low bone mineral density often complicates IBD in children. QUS is
      not an appropriate method for the assessment of bone status in children.
      Nutritional status seems to have a greater impact on bone status than
      corticosteroids therapy.

TI  - Anemia and iron deficiency in gastrointestinal and liver conditions.
PG  - 7908-25

AB  - Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is associated with a number of pathological
      gastrointestinal conditions other than inflammatory bowel disease, and also with 
      liver disorders. Different factors such as chronic bleeding, malabsorption and
      inflammation may contribute to IDA. Although patients with symptoms of anemia are
      frequently referred to gastroenterologists, the approach to diagnosis and
      selection of treatment as well as follow-up measures is not standardized and
      suboptimal. Iron deficiency, even without anemia, can substantially impact
      physical and cognitive function and reduce quality of life. Therefore, regular
      iron status assessment and awareness of the clinical consequences of impaired
      iron status are critical. While the range of options for treatment of IDA is
      increasing due to the availability of effective and well-tolerated parenteral
      iron preparations, a comprehensive overview of IDA and its therapy in patients
      with gastrointestinal conditions is currently lacking. Furthermore, definitions
      and assessment of iron status lack harmonization and there is a paucity of expert
      guidelines on this topic. This review summarizes current thinking concerning IDA 
      as a common co-morbidity in specific gastrointestinal and liver disorders, and
      thus encourages a more unified treatment approach to anemia and iron deficiency, 
      while offering gastroenterologists guidance on treatment options for IDA in
      everyday clinical practice.

AB  - This paper is the first in a series of two publications relating to the European 
      Crohn's and Colitis Organisation [ECCO] evidence-based consensus on the diagnosis
      and management of Crohn's disease and concerns the methodology of the consensus
      process, and the classification, diagnosis and medical management of active and
      quiescent Crohn's disease. Surgical management as well as special situations
      including management of perianal Crohn's disease of this ECCO Consensus are
      covered in a subsequent second paper [Gionchetti et al JCC 2016].

TI  - Bone Metabolism and the c.-223C > T Polymorphism in the 5'UTR Region of the
      Osteoprotegerin Gene in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
PG  - 616-624
AB  - Osteoporosis is more frequent in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. A
      reduction in bone mineral mass in these individuals is caused not only by
      inflammatory processes in the bowel, because osteoporosis occurs already in very 
      young IBD patients and in newly diagnosed individuals who have not yet undergone 
      any pharmacological treatment. One of individual determinants of the bone
      turnover parameters is osteoprotegerin (OPG) encoded by the TNFRSF11B gene. The
      c.-223C > T polymorphism in this gene has been extensively studied in
      post-menopausal osteoporosis patients. However, no such studies exist for
      osteoporosis related to IBD. The aim of our study was to determine whether the
      c.-223C > T (rs2073617) polymorphism in the 5'UTR region of the gene encoding
      osteoprotegerin is a functional polymorphism which may change the gene expression
      and resulting OPG levels, and so be associated with osteopenia and osteoporosis, 
      and impaired bone metabolism in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients. 
      Our study included 198 IBD patients and 41 healthy controls. Lumbar spine and
      femoral neck bone mineral density, T-score, Z-score as well as OPG, RANKL,
      vitamin D, calcium and interleukin 4 and 10 concentrations were determined for
      all study subjects. Genotyping of the TNFRSF11B polymorphic site was performed by
      restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. Statistical analyses were
      conducted using Statistica software. Odds ratios, 95 % confidence intervals, and 
      P values were calculated using the HWE calculator. Our results did not allow
      determining an unequivocal association between the polymorphic variants of the
      TNFRSF11B 5'UTR region and a susceptibility to osteoporosis in IBD patients. We
      have shown, however, that the c.-223T allele was twice as more frequent in
      Crohn's disease (CD) patients than among controls (OR = 1.99, P value = 0.009).
      Interestingly, average osteoprotegerin levels in CD patients did not
      significantly differ from those in controls, whereas in ulcerative colitis
      patients, OPG levels were significantly lower. We have concluded that low OPG
      levels may be associated with osteoporosis in ulcerative colitis, but it is not
      correlated with the c.-223C > T polymorphism in the TNFRSF11B gene. In CD
      patients, in turn, we observed increased RANKL levels. Our observations confirm
      different pathogeneses of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis as well as
      different molecular backgrounds of osteoporosis associated with these two
      diseases.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of chronic, lifelong, and relapsing
      illnesses, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, which involve the
      gastrointestinal tract. There is no cure for these diseases, but combined
      pharmacological and nutritional therapy can induce remission and maintain
      clinical remission. Malnutrition and nutritional deficiencies among IBD patients 
      result in poor clinical outcomes such as growth failure, reduced response to
      pharmacotherapy, increased risk for sepsis, and mortality. The aim of this review
      is to highlight the consequences of malnutrition in the management of IBD and
      describe nutritional interventions to facilitate induction of remission as well
      as maintenance; we will also discuss alternative delivery methods to improve
      nutritional status preoperatively.

AB  - The concept of prebiotics, probiotics, and symbiotics and their use in different 
      situations of daily clinical practice related to clinical nutrition is reviewed, 
      as well as their role in the treatment/prevention of diarrhea (acute, induced by 
      antibiotics, secondary to radiotherapy), inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative
      colitis and pouchitis), in colonic health (constipation, irritable bowel), in
      liver disease (steatosis and minimum encephalopathy), and in intensive care,
      surgical, and liver transplantation. While their effectiveness for preventing
      antibiotic-induced diarrhea and pouchitis in ulcerative colitis appears to be
      shown, additional studies are needed to establish recommendations in most
      clinical settings. The risk of infection associated to use of probiotics is
      relatively low; however, there are selected groups of patients in whom they
      should be used with caution (as jejunum infusion).

TI  - Vedolizumab Therapy in Severe Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
PG  - 2425-31
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000918 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vedolizumab is effective for inducing and maintaining remission in
      adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, there is limited pediatric
      data. This study aimed to describe the adverse events and clinical response to
      vedolizumab in refractory pediatric IBD. METHODS: Disease activity indices,
      clinical response, concomitant medication use, and adverse events were measured
      over 22 weeks in an observational prospective cohort study of children with
      refractory IBD who had failed anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy and subsequently
      initiated vedolizumab therapy. RESULTS: Twenty-one subjects, 16 with Crohn
      disease, received vedolizumab. Clinical response was observed in 6/19 (31.6%) of 
      the evaluable subjects at week 6 and in 11/19 (57.9%) by week 22. Before
      induction, 15/21 (71.4%) participants were treated with systemic corticosteroids,
      as compared with 7/21 (33.3%) subjects at 22 weeks. Steroid-free remission was
      seen in 1/20 (5.0%) subjects at 6 weeks, 3/20 (15.0%) at 14 weeks, and 4/20
      (20.0%) at 22 weeks. There was statistically significant improvement in serum
      albumin and hematocrit; however, C-reactive protein increased by week 22 (P <
      0.05). There were no infusion reactions. Vedolizumab was discontinued in 2
      patients because of severe colitis, requiring surgical intervention. CONCLUSIONS:
      There is limited experience with vedolizumab therapy in pediatric IBD. There
      seems to be a marked number of subjects with clinical response in the first 6
      weeks that increases further by week 22 despite the severity of disease in this
      cohort. Adverse events may not be directly related to vedolizumab. This study is 
      limited by small sample size, and larger prospective studies are warranted.

TI  - Knowledge, Attitudes, and Beliefs Regarding the Role of Nutrition in IBD Among
      Patients and Providers.
PG  - 2474-81
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000901 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malnutrition is common in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
      Identifying patients who are malnourished or at risk for malnutrition may lead to
      early intervention and improve patient outcomes. To date, little is known about
      the role of nutritional assessment and management in IBD care. We aimed to
      evaluate knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs regarding nutrition in IBD among
      patients and providers. METHODS: Surveys were mailed electronically to patients
      and providers identified through their membership in the Crohn's & Colitis
      Foundation of America. In addition, patient and provider focus groups were
      conducted to explore nutrition-related themes. These surveys and focus groups
      were designed to evaluate knowledge and perceived importance of nutrition,
      patient-provider interactions regarding nutrition and use of nutritional
      resources. RESULTS: There were 223 provider respondents (65.5%
      gastroenterologists, 15.2% nurses, and 6.7% dietitians). Forty-one percent of the
      gastroenterologists rated their knowledge of nutrition in IBD as "very good"
      compared with 87% of dietitians and 16% of nurses (P < 0.001). Thirty-three
      percent of the gastroenterologists reported not routinely screening their IBD
      patients for malnutrition. The patient survey had 567 respondents with 27% rating
      their knowledge of nutrition in IBD as "very good." In the focus groups, a lack
      of adequate IBD nutritional resources was evident along with a desire for
      improved access to nutrition specialists. CONCLUSIONS: Significant gaps in
      knowledge relating to nutrition in IBD seem to exist. Targeted educational
      initiatives and improved access to nutritional experts are warranted. In
      addition, a standardized process for the assessment of malnutrition among
      patients with IBD should be developed.

AB  - Although all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) is a key regulator of intestinal
      immunity, its role in colorectal cancer (CRC) is unknown. We found that mice with
      colitis-associated CRC had a marked deficiency in colonic atRA due to alterations
      in atRA metabolism mediated by microbiota-induced intestinal inflammation. Human 
      ulcerative colitis (UC), UC-associated CRC, and sporadic CRC specimens have
      similar alterations in atRA metabolic enzymes, consistent with reduced colonic
      atRA. Inhibition of atRA signaling promoted tumorigenesis, whereas atRA
      supplementation reduced tumor burden. The benefit of atRA treatment was mediated 
      by cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells, which were activated due to MHCI upregulation on
      tumor cells. Consistent with these findings, increased colonic expression of the 
      atRA-catabolizing enzyme, CYP26A1, correlated with reduced frequencies of tumoral
      cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells and with worse disease prognosis in human CRC. These
      results reveal a mechanism by which microbiota drive colon carcinogenesis and
      highlight atRA metabolism as a therapeutic target for CRC.

TI  - Northern Latitude but Not Season Is Associated with Increased Rates of
      Hospitalizations Related to Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Results of a Multi-Year
      Analysis of a National Cohort.
PG  - e0161523
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0161523 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There is growing evidence that the incidence and severity of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may be geographically and seasonally related.
      Why these associations are observed remains unclear. We assessed the impact of
      geographic location, season, and exposure to ultraviolet light on disease
      severity by measuring national hospital IBD-related discharge rates. METHODS:
      Utilizing the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), we identified all patients with 
      IBD-related discharges from 2001-2007. Patients were included if they were
      discharged from states above the 40th parallel (north) or at or below the 35th
      parallel (south); and their discharge fell within the winter (January, February, 
      and March) or summer (July, August, and September). Groups of patients were
      assessed comparing north to south within each season, and summer to winter within
      each region. UV index was recorded from the National Weather Service data and
      compared to monthly discharge rates. RESULTS: There was a consistent pattern of
      increased IBD-related hospitalization rates in northern states compared to
      southern states for both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Differences in
      IBD-related hospitalization rates by season, however, were not uniform across the
      years studied. UV index was significantly inversely associated although not
      proportional to discharge rates for both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In the US, there is a significant increased rate of IBD-related
      hospitalizations in the northern compared to southern states, which not fully
      explained by differences in UV exposure.

      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1335-42

AB  - UNLABELLED: In adult inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, there is a strong
      discrepancy between symptoms and biomarkers of inflammation. Data on pediatric
      IBD patients are conflicting. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the relationship
      between clinical symptoms and biomarkers of inflammation in pediatric IBD.
      Patients aged <18 years with previously diagnosed Crohn's disease (CD) or
      ulcerative colitis (UC) were included. Clinical disease activity was determined
      using the abbreviated Pediatric CD Activity Index (aPCDAI) or Pediatric UC
      Activity Index (PUCAI). Biochemical disease activity was assessed using fecal
      calprotectin (FC) and C-reactive protein (CRP). In total, 127 patients (62 male; 
      median age 14.9 years) were included (82 CD, 45 UC). FC correlated weakly with
      total aPCDAI score (r s = 0.32; 95 % CI 0.12-0.51; p = 0.003) and total PUCAI
      score (r s = 0.36; 95 % CI 0.07-0.62; p = 0.015). Only aPCDAI components
      abdominal examination and perirectal disease and PUCAI component activity level
      had a significant correlation with levels of FC. CRP correlated weakly with total
      aPCDAI score (r s = 0.28; 95 % CI 0.05-0.46; p = 0.012) and aPCDAI components
      abdominal examination and activity level. No significant correlation was observed
      between CRP and total PUCAI score (r s = 0.01; 95 % CI -0.34-0.29; p = 0.961) or 
      individual PUCAI components. CONCLUSION: There is a strong discrepancy between
      clinical symptoms and biomarkers of inflammation in children with IBD. WHAT IS
      KNOWN: * A substantial proportion of asymptomatic pediatric inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) patients have elevated biomarkers of inflammation. * There is a
      strong discrepancy between symptoms and biomarkers of inflammation in adults with
      IBD. What is New: * Clinical symptoms are only weakly associated with levels of
      fecal calprotectin and serum C-reactive protein in children and adolescents with 
      previously diagnosed IBD. * Similarly to adult IBD patients, there is a strong
      discrepancy between clinical symptoms and biomarkers of inflammation in children 
      with IBD.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic pathology that has an outbreaks
      course that in recent years have seen an increase in incidence, especially at
      younger ages. Malnutrition is frequently associated with this condition,
      therefore, it is very important to ensure a right nutritional intervention,
      especially in pediatric patients, to ensure an optimal growth and also an
      improvement in the clinic. Our goal will be updated the role of nutrition in this
      disease and in its treatment based on the published evidence. Malnutrition in
      these patients is frequent and is influenced by various factors such as,
      decreased food intake, increased nutrient requirements, increased protein loss
      and malabsorption of nutrients. Therefore there should be a nutritional
      monitoring of all of them, in which anthropometric measurements, laboratory tests
      and densitometry were made to establish the needs and sufficient caloric intake
      tailored to each patient. The use of enteral nutrition as a treatment in Crohn's 
      disease with mild to moderate outbreak in child population, is amply
      demonstrated, has even shown to be superior to the use of corticosteroids.
      Therefore we can conclude by stressing that nutritional intervention is a
      mainstay in the management of patients with IBD, which aims to prevent and / or
      control disease-related malnutrition to decrease morbidity and mortality and
      improve quality of life.

TI  - Presumed Allergic Proctocolitis Resolves with Probiotic Monotherapy: A Report of 
      4 Cases.
PG  - 621-4
AB  - BACKGROUND The prevalence of allergic diseases has been dramatically rising in
      the United States and other developed nations over recent decades. Growing
      evidence suggests a partial role for the microbiome in the development of these
      allergic diseases. Food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis (AP) (also
      referred to as cow's milk protein intolerance or allergy) is among the earliest
      and most common food allergic diseases of infancy, yet its pathophysiology is not
      well understood. The currently accepted clinical practice is to restrict the diet
      until 12 months of age. CASE REPORT We present 4 cases of clinically diagnosed AP
      whose symptoms quickly and completely resolved with probiotic Lactobacillus
      rhamnosus GG (LGG) monotherapy. All 4 infants avoided any dietary restrictions.
      The range of time from probiotic initiation to symptom resolution was 7-28 days. 
      CONCLUSIONS These cases suggest an important role for the infant intestinal
      microbiome in the development of gastrointestinal mucosal food allergies such as 
      AP. Prospective investigation of the intestinal microbiome in infants with AP may
      further our understanding of this disease's pathogenesis. The potential use of
      probiotic monotherapy in the treatment of AP also warrants further investigation.

AB  - Selenium is an essential micronutrient that is incorporated into at least 25
      selenoproteins encoded by the human genome, many of which serve antioxidant
      functions. Because patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) demonstrate
      nutritional deficiencies and are at increased risk for colon cancer due to
      heightened inflammation and oxidative stress, selenoprotein dysfunction may
      contribute to disease progression. Over the years, numerous studies have analyzed
      the effects of selenoprotein loss and shown that they are important mediators of 
      intestinal inflammation and carcinogenesis. In particular, recent work has
      focused on the role of selenoprotein P (SEPP1), a major selenium transport
      protein which also has endogenous antioxidant function. These experiments
      determined SEPP1 loss altered immune and epithelial cellular function in a murine
      model of colitis-associated carcinoma. Here, we discuss the current knowledge of 
      SEPP1 and selenoprotein function in the setting of IBD, colitis, and inflammatory
      tumorigenesis.

AB  - The impact of the dietary protein level on the process of colonic mucosal
      inflammation and subsequent recovery remains largely unknown. In this study, we
      fed DSS-treated mice with either a normoproteic (NP) or a high-protein (HP)
      isocaloric diet from the beginning of the 5-day dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)
      treatment to 14 days later. Measurements of colitis indicators (colon
      weight:length ratio, myeloperoxidase activity, cytokine expressions) showed a
      similar level of colonic inflammation in both DSS groups during the colitis
      induction phase. However, during the colitis resolution phase, inflammation
      intensity was higher in the DSS-HP group than in the DSS-NP group as evidenced by
      higher inflammatory score and body weight loss. This coincided with a higher
      mortality rate. In surviving animals, an increase in colonic crypt height
      associated with a higher number of colon epithelial cells per crypt, and
      TGF-beta3 content was observed in the DSS-HP vs. DSS-NP group. Moreover, colonic 
      expression patterns of tight junction proteins and E-cadherin were also different
      according to the diet. Altogether, our results indicate that the HP diet, when
      given during both the induction and resolution periods of DSS-induced colitis,
      showed deleterious effects during the post-induction phase. However, HP diet
      ingestion was also associated with morphological and biochemical differences
      compatible with higher colonic epithelium restoration in surviving animals,
      indicating an effect of the dietary protein level on colonic crypt repair after
      acute inflammation. These data highlight the potential impact of the dietary
      protein amount during the colitis course.

TI  - Health Services Utilization, Specialist Care, and Time to Diagnosis with
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Immigrants to Ontario, Canada: A Population-Based
      Cohort Study.
PG  - 2482-90
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000905 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Canada has amongst the highest incidence of inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) in the world, and the highest proportion of immigrants among G8
      nations. We determined differences in prediagnosis delay, specialist care, health
      services use, and risk of surgery in immigrants with IBD. METHODS: All incident
      cases of IBD in children (1994-2009) and adults (1999-2009) were identified from 
      population-based health administrative data in Ontario, Canada. Linked
      immigration data identified those who arrived to Ontario after 1985. We compared 
      time to diagnosis, postdiagnosis health services use (IBD specific and related), 
      physician specialist care in immigrants and nonimmigrants, and risk of surgery
      between immigrants and nonimmigrants. RESULTS: Thousand two hundred two
      immigrants were compared with 22,990 nonimmigrants. Immigrants had similar time
      to diagnosis as nonimmigrants for Crohn's (hazard ratio [HR] 1.002; 95%
      confidence intervals [CIs] 0.89-1.12) and ulcerative colitis (HR 1.073; 95% CI
      0.95-1.21). For outpatient visits, immigrants with IBD were seen by
      gastroenterologists more often than nonimmigrants. Immigrants had greater
      IBD-specific outpatient health services use after diagnosis (odds ratio 1.24; 95%
      CI 1.15-1.33), emergency department visits (odds ratio 1.57, 95% CI 1.30-1.91),
      and hospitalizations (odds ratio 1.19; 95% CI 1.02-1.40). In immigrants, there
      was lower risk of surgery for Crohn's (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.43-0.99) and ulcerative 
      colitis (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.31-0.87). CONCLUSIONS: Immigrants to Canada had
      greater outpatient and specialty care and lower risk of surgery, with no delay in
      diagnosis, indicating appropriate use of the health system.

      Bowel Disease.
PG  - 2121-6
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000865 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Though vedolizumab has received regulatory approval for the treatment
      of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) in adults, there is
      increasing off-label use in children. AIMS: To describe the experience with
      vedolizumab in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients at 3 tertiary 
      IBD centers and examine predictors of remission. METHODS: A retrospective review 
      identified pediatric IBD patients (age < 18 yrs) receiving vedolizumab. Data on
      demographics, disease behavior, location, activity, and previous
      treatments/surgeries were collected. Disease activity was assessed using the
      weighted pediatric CD activity index or pediatric UC activity index. Primary
      outcome was week 14 remission, defined as pediatric UC activity index <10 or
      weighted pediatric CD activity index <12.5. Descriptive statistics and univariate
      analyses were performed to examine associations of clinical characteristics with 
      efficacy. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients, 58% CD and 42% UC, initiated vedolizumab
      between June 2014 and August 2015. Median age at vedolizumab initiation was 14.9 
      (range 7-17) years. Ninety percent had failed >/=1 anti-tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF) agent. Week 14 remission rates for UC and CD were 76% and 42%, respectively
      (P < 0.05). Eighty percent of anti-TNF-naive patients experienced week 14
      remission. At week 22, anti-TNF-naive patients had higher remission rates than
      TNF-exposed patients (100% versus 45%, P = 0.04). There were no infusion
      reactions or serious adverse events/infections. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest 
      that vedolizumab is efficacious and safe in pediatric IBD patients, with UC
      patients experiencing earlier and higher rates of remission than CD patients.
      Anti-TNF-naive patients experienced higher remission rates than those with
      anti-TNF exposure. Controlled clinical trial data are needed to confirm these
      observations.

      Bowel Disease by Whole-exome Sequencing.
PG  - 2317-27
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000890 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most cases of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are caused by complex 
      host-environment interaction. There are a number of conditions associated with a 
      single-gene mutation, most cases are very early onset (aged < 6 yr), present with
      a unique form of disease and often have atypical features. METHODS: Whole-exome
      data for 147 pediatric patients with IBD were interrogated for a panel of 51
      genes associated with monogenic IBD. Observed variation was categorized according
      to the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) guidelines to identify rare,
      novel, and known variants that might contribute to IBD. RESULTS: Five hundred
      seventy-four variants were identified across 51 genes. These were categorized in 
      line with ACMG guidance to remove benign variants and to identify "pathogenic"
      and "likely pathogenic" variants. In 6 patients, we observed 6 pathogenic
      variants of which CYBA(c.287+2T>C), COL7A1(c.6501+1G>C), LIG4(p.R814X), and
      XIAP(p.T470S) were known causative mutations, and FERMT1(p.R271Q) and
      SKIV2L(c.354+5G>A) were novel. In the 3 patients with XIAP, SKIV2L, and FERMT1
      variants, individuals' disease features resembled the monogenic phenotype. This
      was despite apparent heterozygous carriage of pathogenic variation for the latter
      2 genes. The XIAP variant was observed in a hemizygous male. CONCLUSIONS:
      Whole-exome sequencing allows for identification of known and de novo potentially
      causative mutations in genes associated with monogenic IBD. Although these are
      rare conditions, it is vital to identify causative mutations early to improve
      prognosis. We postulate that in a subset of IBD, heterozygous mutations (in genes
      believed to manifest IBD through autosomal recessive inheritance) may contribute 
      to clinical presentation.

TI  - Urinary Metabolic Phenotyping Reveals Differences in the Metabolic Status of
      Healthy and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Children in Relation to Growth and
      Disease Activity.
LID - 10.3390/ijms17081310 [doi]
LID - E1310 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Growth failure and delayed puberty are well known features of
      children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), in addition to
      the chronic course of the disease. Urinary metabonomics was applied in order to
      better understand metabolic changes between healthy and IBD children. METHODS: 21
      Pediatric patients with IBD (mean age 14.8 years, 8 males) were enrolled from the
      Pediatric Gastroenterology Outpatient Clinic over two years. Clinical and
      biological data were collected at baseline, 6, and 12 months. 27 healthy children
      (mean age 12.9 years, 16 males) were assessed at baseline. Urine samples were
      collected at each visit and subjected to (1)H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
      spectroscopy. RESULTS: Using (1)H NMR metabonomics, we determined that urine
      metabolic profiles of IBD children differ significantly from healthy controls.
      Metabolic differences include central energy metabolism, amino acid, and gut
      microbial metabolic pathways. The analysis described that combined urinary urea
      and phenylacetylglutamine-two readouts of nitrogen metabolism-may be relevant to 
      monitor metabolic status in the course of disease. CONCLUSION: Non-invasive
      sampling of urine followed by metabonomic profiling can elucidate and monitor the
      metabolic status of children in relation to disease status. Further developments 
      of omic-approaches in pediatric research might deliver novel nutritional and
      metabolic hypotheses.

TI  - What Are the Top 10 Research Questions in the Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel
      Disease? A Priority Setting Partnership with the James Lind Alliance.
PG  - 204-211
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjw144 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Many uncertainties remain regarding optimal therapies and
      strategies for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. Setting research
      priorities addressing therapies requires a partnership between health care
      professionals, patients and organisations supporting patients. We aimed to use
      the structure of the James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership, which has 
      been used in other disease areas, to identify and prioritise unanswered questions
      about treatments for inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: The James Lind Priority
      Setting Partnership uses methods agreed and adopted in other disease areas to
      work with patients and clinicians: to identify uncertainties about treatments; to
      agree by consensus a prioritised list of uncertainties for research; then to
      translate these uncertainties into research questions which are amenable to
      hypothesis testing; and finally to take results to research commissioning bodies 
      to be considered for funding. RESULTS: A total of 1636 uncertainties were
      collected in the initial survey from 531 respondents, which included 22% health
      care professionals and 78% patients and carers. Using the rigorously applied
      processes of the priority setting partnership, this list was distilled down to
      the top 10 research priorities for inflammatory bowel disease. The top priorities
      were: identifying treatment strategies to optimise efficacy, safety and
      cost-effectiveness; and stratifying patients with regard to their disease course 
      and treatment response. Diet and symptom control [pain, incontinence and fatigue]
      were also topics which were prioritised. CONCLUSIONS: A partnership involving
      multidisciplinary clinicians, patients and organisations supporting patients has 
      identified the top 10 research priorities in the treatment of patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - The Natural History of Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis in Children: A Large
      Single-Center Longitudinal Cohort Study.
PG  - 603-609
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Data regarding pediatric primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) natural
      history are limited. We describe a large pediatric PSC cohort with longitudinal
      follow-up. METHODS: The present study records review of pediatric patients with
      PSC diagnosed between 1984 and 2014. RESULTS: N = 120 (63% M) ages 1 to 21 years 
      (median 14 years) at diagnosis. 27% (31/113) had autoimmune sclerosing
      cholangitis (ASC), 24% had exclusive small duct PSC, METAVIR stage was F3-F4 in
      41%. Eighty-one percent of patients with PSC had inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD); most had ulcerative/indeterminate colitis (72/97), typically pancolitis
      (40/72). PSC-IBD was more common than ASC-IBD (85% vs 68%, P = 0.03). Median
      follow-up was 3.7 years (interquartile range [IQR] 1.5, 6.9). Median gamma
      glutamyl transferase decreased from baseline of 221 U/L (IQR 110, 425) to 104 U/L
      by 1 year postdiagnosis ([IQR 18,229], P < 0.0001), and then changed little. Mean
      fibrosis stage at diagnosis was 2.3 +/- 1.4 (N = 91), and at 1 to 5 years was 2.6
      +/- 1.3 (N = 20). Transplant-free survival at 10 year was 89%; there were 6 liver
      transplants, 2 in patients with small duct PSC and 4 with diffuse large duct PSC.
      Although the cirrhosis rate was not significantly different in PSC with IBD
      versus without (22% vs 41%, P = 0.06), the former had a lower rate of liver
      transplantation (2% vs 18%, P = 0.01). The rate of cirrhosis was lower in
      patients diagnosed with IBD before PSC (15% vs 31%, P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In
      this largest reported pediatric PSC cohort, liver transplantation rate at 10
      years was lower than that reported in adults. ASC and PSC had similar biochemical
      abnormalities and degree of fibrosis at diagnosis. PSC that developed after IBD
      diagnosis had a milder course, possibly reflecting earlier disease detection or
      milder phenotype.

      ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 12342
LID - 10.1038/ncomms12342 [doi]
AB  - Protein-truncating variants protective against human disease provide in vivo
      validation of therapeutic targets. Here we used targeted sequencing to conduct a 
      search for protein-truncating variants conferring protection against inflammatory
      bowel disease exploiting knowledge of common variants associated with the same
      disease. Through replication genotyping and imputation we found that a predicted 
      protein-truncating variant (rs36095412, p.R179X, genotyped in 11,148 ulcerative
      colitis patients and 295,446 controls, MAF=up to 0.78%) in RNF186, a single-exon 
      ring finger E3 ligase with strong colonic expression, protects against ulcerative
      colitis (overall P=6.89 x 10(-7), odds ratio=0.30). We further demonstrate that
      the truncated protein exhibits reduced expression and altered subcellular
      localization, suggesting the protective mechanism may reside in the loss of an
      interaction or function via mislocalization and/or loss of an essential
      transmembrane domain.

TI  - Can we improve the therapy of Clostridium difficile infection in elderly
      patients?
PG  - 592-8
LID - 10.1007/s00508-016-1056-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is becoming a serious problem
      predominantly in geriatric patients, who are a significant risk group. The goal
      of this study was to evaluate the risk factors for mortality in CDI patients and 
      to construct a binary logistic regression model that describes the probability of
      mortality in geriatric patients suffering from CDI. METHODS: In this
      retrospective study, we evaluated a group of 235 patients over 65 years of age
      with confirmed diagnoses of CDI, hospitalized at the Department of Internal
      Medicine, Geriatrics and General Practice, Brno, from January 2008 to December
      2013. The examined group comprised 148 women (63 %) and 87 men (37 %). For the
      diagnosis of CDI, confirmation of A and B toxins in the patients' stool or an
      autopsy confirmation was crucial. RESULTS: The impact of antibiotic therapy on
      the increased incidence of CDI was clearly confirmed in our study group when
      examining patients' histories. Other risk factors included cerebrovascular
      disease, dementia, the presence of pressure ulcers, and immobility. Our new model
      consisted of a combination of the following parameters: the number of antibiotics
      used (from patients' history), nutritional status (Mini Nutritional Assessment
      short-form test), presence of pressure ulcers, and occurrence of fever.
      CONCLUSION: Our logistic regression model may predict mortality in geriatric
      patients suffering from CDI. This could help improve the therapeutic process.

TI  - Golimumab for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1273-82
LID - 10.1080/17512433.2016.1221759 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Anti-TNF agents are the mainstay of therapy in patients with
      moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC) not responding to 5-aminosalisylic
      acid, corticosteroids, immunmodulators and for patients dependent on
      corticosteroids. There is a therapeutic gap of 30%- 60% with infliximab and
      adalimumab, which is required to be bridged by newer agents. The present review
      summarizes the literature on the role of golimumab, a new anti TNF agent, in
      ulcerative colitis. AREAS COVERED: Literature search was done on PubMed using the
      search terms 'golimumab' AND 'ulcerative colitis' from inception till March 2016.
      Golimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against TNF-alpha, was approved by
      FDA for clinical use in UC in 2013. In vitro studies showed golimumab to be
      better than infliximab and adalimumab in terms of affinity and neutralization of 
      TNF-alpha and its conformational stability. Golimumab was found to be effective
      and safe in inducing and maintaining clinical remission, clinical response and
      mucosal healing in patients with UC in the two registration trials. Expert
      commentary: Although there is no difference in terms of efficacy between
      golimumab, infliximab and adalimumab, golimumab is better than infliximab in
      terms of route of administration (subcutaneous vs intravenous) and better than
      adalimumab in terms of frequency of dosing (4 weeks vs 2 weeks).

      disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis remain incompletely defined. Here, we aimed
      to identify novel associations between IBD and functional genetic variants using 
      the Illumina ExomeChip (San Diego, CA). METHODS: Genotyping was performed in
      10,523 IBD cases and 5726 non-IBD controls. There were 91,713 functional
      single-nucleotide polymorphism loci in coding regions analyzed. A novel
      identified association was replicated further in 2 independent cohorts. We
      further examined the association of the identified single-nucleotide polymorphism
      with microbiota from 338 mucosal lavage samples in the Mucosal Luminal Interface 
      cohort measured using 16S sequencing. RESULTS: We identified an association
      between CD and a missense variant encoding alanine or threonine at position 391
      in the zinc transporter solute carrier family 39, member 8 protein (SLC39A8
      alanine 391 threonine, rs13107325) and replicated the association with CD in 2
      replication cohorts (combined meta-analysis P = 5.55 x 10(-13)). This variant has
      been associated previously with distinct phenotypes including obesity, lipid
      levels, blood pressure, and schizophrenia. We subsequently determined that the CD
      risk allele was associated with altered colonic mucosal microbiome composition in
      both healthy controls (P = .009) and CD cases (P = .0009). Moreover, microbes
      depleted in healthy carriers strongly overlap with those reduced in CD patients
      (P = 9.24 x 10(-16)) and overweight individuals (P = 6.73 x 10(-16)).
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that an SLC39A8-dependent shift in the gut
      microbiome could explain its pleiotropic effects on multiple complex diseases
      including CD.

TI  - A long noncoding RNA signature for ulcerative colitis identifies IFNG-AS1 as an
      enhancer of inflammation.
PG  - G446-57
LID - 10.1152/ajpgi.00212.2016 [doi]
AB  - High-throughput technologies revealed new categories of genes, including the long
      noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), involved in the pathogenesis of human disease; however,
      the role of lncRNAs in the ulcerative colitis (UC) has not been evaluated. Gene
      expression profiling was used to develop lncRNA signatures in UC samples. Jurkat 
      T cells were activated by PMA/ionomycin subsequently interferon-gamma (IFNG) and 
      tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha protein levels were assessed by ELISA.
      Anti-sense molecules were designed to block IFNG-AS1 expression. A unique set of 
      lncRNAs was differentially expressed between UC and control samples. Of these,
      IFNG-AS1 was among the highest statistically significant lncRNAs (fold change:
      5.27, P value: 7.07E-06). Bioinformatic analysis showed that IFNG-AS1 was
      associated with the IBD susceptibility loci SNP rs7134599 and its genomic
      location is adjacent to the inflammatory cytokine IFNG. In mouse models of
      colitis, active colitis samples had increased colonic expression of this lncRNA. 
      Utilizing the Jurkat T cell model, we found IFNG-AS1 to positively regulate IFNG 
      expression. Novel lncRNA signatures differentiate UC patients with active
      disease, patients in remission, and control subjects. A subset of these lncRNAs
      was found to be associated with the clinically validated IBD susceptibility loci.
      IFNG-AS1 was one of these differentially expressed lncRNAs in UC patients and
      found to regulate the key inflammatory cytokine, IFNG, in CD4 T cells. Taking
      these findings together, our study revealed novel lncRNA signatures deregulated
      in UC and identified IFNG-AS1 as a novel regulator of IFNG inflammatory
      responses, suggesting the potential importance of noncoding RNA mechanisms on
      regulation of inflammatory bowel disease-related inflammatory responses.

TI  - Ulcerative proctitis is a frequent location of paediatric-onset UC and not a
      minor disease: a population-based study.
PG  - 1912-1917
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2016-311970 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Natural history of paediatric-onset ulcerative proctitis (UP) is
      poorly described. Our aim was to describe the phenotype and disease course of
      incident UP in a population-based study of paediatric-onset UC. PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: All patients with UC diagnosed <17 years from 1988 to 2004, and followed
      during >2 years have been extracted from a population-based registry. UC location
      was defined according to the Paris classification. Cumulative risks for use of
      immunosuppressants (IS), anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) therapy,
      colonic extension and colectomy were described using Kaplan-Meier method. Risk
      factors for colonic extension were assessed using Cox proportional hazards
      models. RESULTS: 158 patients with paediatric-onset UC (91 females) with a median
      age at diagnosis of 14.5 years (Q1: 11.4-Q3: 16.1) have been identified and
      followed during a median of 11.4 years (8.2-15.8). Among them, 25% had UP (E1) at
      diagnosis and 49% of them presented a colonic extension at maximal follow-up. In 
      these children, the cumulative risk for colonic extension was 10% at 1 year, 45% 
      at 5 years and 52% at 10 years. No parameter at diagnosis was associated with
      colonic extension in the UP (E1 group). IS use was significantly lower in
      patients with UP than in those with E2, E3 or E4 location (p=0.049). For the UP
      cohort, the cumulative risk for colectomy was 3% at 1 year, 10% at 5 years, 13%
      at 10 years and 13% at 15 years. Risks for colonic extension, treatment with
      anti-TNF-alpha and colectomy did not differ between the E1 group and the E2-E3-E4
      group. CONCLUSIONS: UP is frequent in paediatric-onset UC and should not be
      considered as a minor disease. Compared with more extensive UC locations, risks
      for colonic extension, anti-TNF-alpha therapy and colectomy were similar in UP,
      whereas the risk for use of IM was lower.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial on the effect of vitamin D3 on inflammation and
      cathelicidin gene expression in ulcerative colitis patients.
PG  - 316-23
LID - 10.4103/1319-3767.187606 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an intestinal chronic
      inflammatory condition and includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis
      (UC). It has been proposed that Vitamin D supplementation may have a beneficial
      role in IBD. AIM: To characterize the effects of Vitamin D on cathelicidin
      (hCAP/LL37) gene expression, ESR, and serum hs-CRP levels. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Ninety UC patients on remission were randomized to receive 300,000 IU
      intramuscular Vitamin D or 1 mL normal saline as placebo, respectively. Before
      and 90 days after intervention, serum levels of 25 (OH)-Vitamin D3, PTH, Calcium,
      ESR, and hs-CRP were measured. Cathelicidin gene expression was also quantified
      using qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Baseline serum 25-OH-Vitamin D3 levels were not different
      between the two groups and after intervention, increased only in Vitamin D group 
      (P < 0.001). Hs-CRP levels were lower in Vitamin D group after intervention
      (Before: 3.43 +/- 3.47 vs 3.86 +/- 3.55 mg/L, P = 0.56; after: 2.31 +/- 2.25 vs
      3.90 +/- 3.97 mg/L, P= 0.023). ESR decreased significantly in Vitamin D group
      (Before: 12.4 +/- 6.1 vs 12.1 +/- 5.3 mm/h, P= 0.77; after: 6.7 +/- 4.5 vs 11.4
      +/- 5.5 mm/h, P< 0.001). The mean fold change in hCAP18 gene expression in
      Vitamin D group was significantly higher than placebo group. (Mean +/- SD: 3.13
      +/- 2.56 vs 1.09 +/- 0.56; median +/- interquartile range: 2.17 +/- 3.81 vs 0.87 
      +/- 0.53, P< 0.001). CONCLUSION: Decreases in ESR and hs-CRP levels and increase 
      in LL37 gene expression support the hypothesis that Vitamin D supplementation may
      have a beneficial role in UC patients.

TI  - A secretome view of colonisation factors in Shiga toxin-encoding Escherichia coli
      (STEC): from enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) to related enteropathotypes.
LID - 10.1093/femsle/fnw179 [doi]
LID - fnw179 [pii]
AB  - Shiga toxin-encoding Escherichia coli (STEC) regroup strains that carry genes
      encoding Shiga toxin (Stx). Among intestinal pathogenic E. coli,
      enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) constitute the major subgroup of virulent STEC.
      EHEC cause serious human disease such as haemorrhagic colitis and
      haemolytic-uremic syndrome. While EHEC have evolved from enteropathogenic E.
      coli, hybrids with enteroaggregative E. coli have recently emerged. Of note, some
      enteroinvasive E. coli also belong to the STEC group. While the LEE (locus of
      enterocyte effacement) is a key and prominent molecular determinant in the
      pathogenicity, neither all EHEC nor STEC contain the LEE, suggesting that they
      possess additional virulence and colonisation factors. Currently, nine protein
      secretion systems have been described in diderm-lipopolysaccharide bacteria
      (archetypal Gram-negative) and can be involved in the secretion of extracellular 
      effectors, cell-surface proteins or assembly of cell-surface organelles, such as 
      flagella or pili. In this review, we focus on the secretome of STEC and related
      enteropathotypes, which are relevant to the colonisation of biotic and abiotic
      surfaces. Considering the wealth of potential protein trafficking mechanisms, the
      different combinations of colonisation factors and modulation of their expression
      is further emphasised with regard to the ecophysiology of STEC.

TI  - Fecal microbiota transplantation in inflammatory bowel disease: the quest for the
      holy grail.
PG  - 1360-1365
LID - 10.1038/mi.2016.67 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is due to an aberrant immune response toward
      luminal antigens, probably commensal bacteria, in genetically susceptible
      subjects and is also influenced by environmental factors. An imbalanced
      intestinal microbiota known as "dysbiosis," characterized by an increased
      proportion of pro-inflammatory microorganisms and a decreased proportion of
      anti-inflammatory microorganisms, has been repeatedly observed in IBD and is now 
      recognized as a key factor in the gut inflammatory process. Fecal microbiota
      transplantation (FMT) has gained interest as a novel treatment option in IBD. The
      goal of FMT in IBD is not only to correct the dysbiosis, but also to restore a
      normal dialog between the host immune system and the microbiota. Data are still
      scarce, but the results of the first studies suggest that FMT could be a
      promising therapy in IBD. More studies are needed to define the best indications,
      optimal timing, frequency, mode of delivery, and the optimal donor for each
      patient.

TI  - Exposure to Ambient Air Pollution and the Risk of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A
      European Nested Case-Control Study.
PG  - 2963-2971
LID - 10.1007/s10620-016-4249-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Industrialization has been linked to the etiology of inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD). AIM: We investigated the association between air pollution
      exposure and IBD. METHODS: The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and
      Nutrition cohort was used to identify cases with Crohn's disease (CD) (n = 38)
      and ulcerative colitis (UC) (n = 104) and controls (n = 568) from Denmark,
      France, the Netherlands, and the UK, matched for center, gender, age, and date of
      recruitment. Air pollution data were obtained from the European Study of Cohorts 
      for Air Pollution Effects. Residential exposure was assessed with land-use
      regression models for particulate matter with diameters of <10 mum (PM10), <2.5
      mum (PM2.5), and between 2.5 and 10 mum (PMcoarse), soot (PM2.5 absorbance),
      nitrogen oxides, and two traffic indicators. Conditional logistic regression
      analyses were performed to calculate odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % confidence
      intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Although air pollution was not significantly associated
      with CD or UC separately, the associations were mostly similar. Individuals with 
      IBD were less likely to have higher exposure levels of PM2.5 and PM10, with ORs
      of 0.24 (95 % CI 0.07-0.81) per 5 mug/m(3) and 0.25 (95 % CI 0.08-0.78) per 10
      mug/m(3), respectively. There was an inverse but nonsignificant association for
      PMcoarse. A higher nearby traffic load was positively associated with IBD [OR
      1.60 (95 % CI 1.04-2.46) per 4,000,000 motor vehicles x m per day]. Other air
      pollutants were positively but not significantly associated with IBD. CONCLUSION:
      Exposure to air pollution was not found to be consistently associated with IBD.

TI  - Importance of the Evaluation of N-Acetyltransferase Enzyme Activity Prior to
      5-Aminosalicylic Acid Medication for Ulcerative Colitis.
PG  - 1793-802
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000823 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) is a classic anti-inflammatory drug for
      the treatment of ulcerative colitis. N-acetyltransferase (NAT) enzymes convert
      5-ASA to its metabolite N-acetyl-5-ASA, and it is unresolved whether 5-ASA or
      N-acetyl-5-ASA is the effective therapeutic molecule. We previously demonstrated 
      that colonic production of N-acetyl-5-ASA (NAT activity) is decreased in dextran 
      sulfate sodium-induced colitis. Our hypothesis is that 5-ASA is the therapeutic
      molecule to improve colitis, with the corollary that altered NAT activity affects
      drug efficacy. Since varying clinical effectiveness of 5-ASA has been reported,
      we also ask if NAT activity varies with inflammation in pediatric or adult
      patients. METHODS: Acute colonic inflammation was induced in C57BL/6 NAT
      wild-type (WT) or knockout mice, using 3.5% dextran sulfate sodium (w/v)
      concurrent with 5-ASA treatment. Adult and pediatric rectosigmoid biopsies were
      collected from control or patients with ulcerative colitis. Tissue was analyzed
      for NAT and myeloperoxidase activity. RESULTS: Dextran sulfate sodium-induced
      colitis was of similar severity in both NAT WT and knockout mice, and NAT
      activity was significantly decreased in NAT WT mice. In the setting of colitis,
      5-ASA significantly restored colon length and decreased myeloperoxidase activity 
      in NAT knockout but not in WT mice. Myeloperoxidase activity negatively
      correlated with NAT activity in pediatric patients, but correlation was not
      observed in adult patients. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammation decreases NAT activity in
      the colon of mice and human pediatric patients. Decreased NAT activity enhances
      the therapeutic effect of 5-ASA in mice. A NAT activity assay could be useful to 
      help predict the efficacy of 5-ASA therapy.

TI  - Patients with inflammatory bowel disease and their treating clinicians have
      different views regarding diet.
PG  - 66-72
LID - 10.1111/jhn.12400 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diet and body composition play unclear roles in the pathogenesis,
      activity and symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Evidence-based
      guidance regarding dietary modification in IBD is lacking. We aimed to determine 
      the attitudes of IBD patients and clinicians to diet. METHODS: The present
      cross-sectional study comprised an online questionnaire distributed to members of
      a national IBD patient organisation, assessing demographics, anthropometry,
      disease phenotype and dietary beliefs. Dietitians, gastroenterologists and
      surgeons were targeted for a similar questionnaire as a result of membership of
      national professional bodies. RESULTS: Nine hundred and twenty-eight patients
      (72.2% female; mean age 39.5 years; age range 5-91 years) responded. Two-thirds
      of the patients had Crohn's disease. The mean reported body mass index was 24.9
      kg m(-2) and was significantly skewed to the right. Patients who had taken >10
      courses of steroids were had a greater probability of being overweight or obese, 
      independent of disease complications. Most patients (71%) assumed that their diet
      affected their IBD; 61% considered their IBD specialist disregarded the
      importance of diet. Of the 136 clinicians who responded, the majority felt that
      diet was a factor in symptoms and intestinal microbiota. More gastroenterologists
      (44%) than dietitians (17%) considered that diet had a role in the pathogenesis
      of IBD (P = 0.003). Twenty-six percent of patients reported receiving dietary
      advice from their IBD specialist, whereas 98% of gastroenterologists reported
      advice provision. Patients received diverse advice. Half of the patients followed
      recommendations provided by a clinician. CONCLUSIONS: The present study
      demonstrates that IBD patients consider diet to be important in their disease.
      IBD clinicians from different disciplines have diverse views of the role of diet.
      Advice given to patients is heterogeneous, often perceived as inadequate and
      poorly followed.

PG  - 500-3
LID - 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0578-1310.2016.07.005 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the efficacy and safety of the application of enteral
      nutrition (EN) in gastrointestinal disease in children, and to explore the
      possibility of the implementation of family EN. METHOD: Retrospective analysis of
      disease spectrum, EN approach, preparation, speed and time as well as adverse
      reactions and outcomes in 47 pediatric patients with gastrointestinal disease
      underwent EN therapy during July 2014 to March 2015. The nutrition indicators
      before and after EN therapy were compared by paired t-test. RESULT: A total of 47
      patients were selected, 27 male (57%) and 20 female (43%), aged 0.8 (0.3, 4.0)
      years, 9 with mechanical or chemical damage to the esophagus, 7 with inflammatory
      bowel disease (including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease), 6 with chronic 
      diarrhea, 5 with acute pancreatitis, 3 with acute diarrhea and severe
      malnutrition, 3 with short bowel syndrome, 3 with improper feeding, 3 with
      feeding difficulties, 3 with protein losing enteropathy, 2 with post-enterostomy,
      2 with enterocolitis, 1 with gastroesophageal reflux, were diagnosed. Of 47
      cases, 22 were given oral nutrition, 28 were fed with nasogastric tube and 4 with
      nasojejunal tube feeding, 2 with percutaneous endoscopic gastrojejunostomy tube
      feeding for each. In these tube-feeding cases, 20 cases were treated with
      continuous infusion and 21 cases with intermittent infusion. Eleven cases were
      fed with amino acid formula; 21 cases took the choice of peptide formulations; 16
      cases chose whole protein formula, including six cases who chose 3.3-4.2 kJ/ml
      higher energy density formula, 10 cases selected common energy density formula
      including breast milk. Twenty-one cases suffered from different degrees of
      adverse reactions, including vomiting in 7 cases, abdominal pain and bloating in 
      3, diarrhea in 12, secondary respiratory infections in 5. Five patients were
      discharged after giving up of treatment by parents due to poor efficacy on
      primary disease; 3 cases were transferred to other departments for further
      treatment; 15 cases were discharged with a feeding tube for family nutrition and 
      specialist out-patient treatment. The rest 24 cases were all improved and
      discharged. There were significant differences in nutrition indicators before and
      after EN, weight-for-age Z score (WAZ)(-2.3+/-1.9 vs. -1.9+/-1.8, t=4.156,
      P=0.000), weight-for-height Z score (WHZ)(-1.9+/-1.7 vs. -1.2+/-1.5, t=3.714,
      P=0.001), albumin ((35+/-9)g/L vs.(39+/-6) g/L, t=3.017, P=0.005) and prealbumin 
      ((0.11+/-0.05)g/L vs.(0.18+/-0.07)g/L, t=5.144, P=0.000). CONCLUSION: EN is
      suitable for a variety of children's digestive diseases, which can improve the
      nutritional status of the patients and was safe for clinical application. As the 
      implementation of EN is simple and has good compliance, family EN is proven to be
      feasible.

TI  - Novel antimicrobial peptide prevents C. rodentium infection in C57BL/6 mice by
      enhancing acid-induced pathogen killing.
PG  - 1641-1650
LID - 10.1099/mic.0.000335 [doi]
AB  - Citrobacter rodentium is a Gram-negative, murine-specific enteric pathogen that
      infects epithelial cells in the colon. It is closely related to the clinically
      relevant human pathogen, enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), a leading
      cause of haemorrhagic colitis and haemolytic uremic syndrome. We have previously 
      reported that a novel antimicrobial peptide, wrwycr, compromises bacterial DNA
      repair and significantly reduces the survival of acid-stressed EHEC, suggesting
      an antimicrobial strategy for targeting the survival of ingested EHEC. This study
      examines the impact of peptide pretreatment on survival of the closely related
      murine pathogen, C. rodentium, before and after acid stress, using both in vitro 
      and in vivo investigations. Peptide pretreatment of C. rodentium significantly
      and dramatically increases acid-stress-induced killing in a
      peptide-dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Reduction in survival rates
      after brief pretreatment with peptide (25-65 microM) followed by 1 h at pH 3.5
      ranges from 6 to 8 log fold relative to untreated C. rodentium, with no
      detectable bacteria after 65 microM peptide-acid treatment. Using a C57BL/6 mouse
      model of infection, peptide pretreatment of C. rodentium with wrwycr prior to
      orogastric gavage eliminates evidence of infection based on C. rodentium
      colonization levels, faecal scores, colonic histology, faecal microbiome and
      visual observation of overall animal health. These findings provide compelling
      evidence for the role of the peptide wrwycr as a potential strategy to control
      the growth and colonization of enteric pathogens.

TI  - Handgrip Strength Index Predicts Nutritional Status as a Complement to Body Mass 
      Index in Crohn's Disease.
PG  - 1395-1400
AB  - BACKGROUND: Body mass index [BMI] is widely used to measure nutritional status in
      Crohn's disease [CD] patients, but limitations remain. Measuring handgrip
      strength index, in addition to BMI, may aid in overcoming limitations. METHODS: A
      total of 150 patients with CD and 254 controls were included in this study. All
      patients and controls underwent BMI, handgrip strength and bioelectrical
      impedance analysis. Bioelectrical impedance analysis included body cell mass,
      bone mineral content, skeletal muscle mass and body fat mass. A total of 88 CD
      patients were age-, sex- and BMI-matched with healthy controls for further
      analysis. RESULTS: BMI, body cell mass, body cell mass index, handgrip strength
      and handgrip strength index were all significantly decreased in the group of CD
      patients compared with controls [p < 0.0001]. When paired by BMI, healthy
      controls had significantly increased body cell mass index[p = 0.0344] and
      handgrip strength index [p = 0.0010] compared to patients. In addition, handgrip 
      strength was well correlated with body cell mass [r = 0.8365, p < 0.0001].
      CONCLUSIONS: BMI is widely used for detecting malnutrition, but it is less
      sensitive in predicting loss of body cell mass and skeletal muscle mass. Our
      study shows that handgrip strength index is an effective and convenient parameter
      to predict the functional nutritional status and muscular health in CD patients.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] is characterized by chronic inflammation of the 
      gastrointestinal tract. Medications such as corticosteroids, thiopurines,
      immunomodulators and biologic agents are used to induce and maintain remission;
      however, response to these drugs is variable and can diminish over time.
      Defective autophagy has been strongly linked to IBD pathogenesis, with evidence
      showing that enhancing autophagy may be therapeutically beneficial by regulating 
      inflammation and clearing intestinal pathogens. It is plausible that the
      therapeutic effects of some IBD drugs are mediated in part through modulation of 
      the autophagy pathway, with studies investigating a wide range of diseases and
      cell types demonstrating autophagy pathway regulation by these agents. This
      review will highlight the current evidence, both in vitro and in vivo, for the
      modulation of autophagy by drugs routinely used in IBD. A clearer understanding
      of their mechanisms of action will be invaluable to utilize these drugs in a more
      targeted and personalized manner in this diverse and often complex group of
      patients.

TI  - North American Pediatric Gastroenterology Fellowship Needs Assessment in
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Trainee and Program Director Perspectives.
PG  - 1616-20
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000801 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) care is complex and
      rapidly evolving. The Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America and North
      American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition
      cosponsored a needs assessment survey of pediatric gastroenterology trainees and 
      program directors (PDs) to inform on educational programming. METHODS: A
      Web-based, self-completed survey was provided to North American trainees and PDs 
      during the 2013-2014 academic year. Standard descriptive statistics summarized
      demographics and responses. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-six of 326 (51%) trainees 
      (62% female) and 37 of 74 (50%) PDs responded. Median trainees per program = 5
      and median total faculty = 10 (3 IBD experts); 15% of programs did not have a
      self-identified "IBD expert" faculty member. Sixty-nine percent of trainees were 
      confident/somewhat confident in their IBD inpatient training, whereas 54% were
      confident/somewhat confident in their outpatient training. Trainees identified
      activities that would most improve their education, including didactics (55%),
      interaction with national experts (50%), trainee-centered IBD Web resources
      (42%), and increased patient exposure (42%). Trainees were most confident in
      managing inpatient active Crohn's disease/ulcerative colitis, phenotype
      classification, managing biological therapies, and using clinical disease
      activity indices. They were least confident in managing J-pouch complications,
      performing pouchoscopy, managing extraintestinal manifestations, and
      ostomy-related complications. Eighty-five percent would like an IBD-focused
      training elective. Most directors (86%) would allow trainees to do electives at
      other institutions. CONCLUSIONS: This IBD needs assessment survey of pediatric
      gastroenterology trainees and PDs demonstrated a strong resource commitment to
      IBD training and clinical care. Areas for educational enrichment emerged,
      including pouch and ostomy complications.

TI  - Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration is inversely associated with mucosal
      inflammation in patients with ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 113-20
LID - 10.3945/ajcn.115.123786 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin D exerts anti-inflammatory actions both in vitro and in
      murine models of colitis. In previous studies, we demonstrated that vitamin D
      protects against the development of colitis by maintaining the integrity of the
      intestinal mucosal barrier. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate whether deficient
      serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations are associated with increased 
      mucosal inflammation, a loss of epithelial junctional proteins, and an increase
      in mucosal inflammatory cytokines in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC).
      DESIGN: We prospectively enrolled 230 subjects with UC. Serum 25(OH)D
      concentrations were compared with the Mayo endoscopic score, the total Mayo
      score, and histologic activity. Colonic mucosal expression concentrations of
      vitamin D receptor (VDR), E-cadherin, zonula occluden 1 (ZO-1), occludin,
      claudin-2, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin 8 (IL-8) were
      compared between dichotomous groups with low or high serum 25(OH)D
      concentrations. RESULTS: The mean serum 25(OH)D concentration was 21.8 ng/mL.
      Subjects stratified by concentrations included 12.6% >/=30 ng/mL, 45.6% >/=20 to 
      <30 ng/mL, 37.4% >/=10 to <20 ng/mL, and 4.4% <10 ng/mL. There was an inverse
      association between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and mucosal inflammation as
      assessed by the Mayo endoscopy score (P = 0.01), disease activity as indicated by
      the total Mayo score (P = 0.001), and histologic activity (P = 0.02). A serum
      25(OH)D concentration <20 ng/mL was associated with decreased mucosal transcript 
      and protein expression concentrations of VDR, E-cadherin, and occludin as well as
      decreased protein expression of ZO-1, whereas TNF-alpha and IL-8 mucosal
      transcript expression concentrations were increased. CONCLUSIONS: In UC patients,
      serum 25(OH)D concentration is inversely correlated with mucosal inflammation and
      disease activity. These results, coupled with the findings that serum 25(OH)D
      concentrations correlate with the mucosal expression of VDR as well as epithelial
      junction proteins and inversely with proinflammatory cytokines, suggest that
      vitamin D deficiency may contribute to UC inflammation by disrupting epithelial
      barrier function.

PG  - 1647-54
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000828 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed at describing the efficacy of azathioprine (AZA) in
      pediatric ulcerative colitis, comparing the outcomes of early (0-6 months) versus
      late (6-24 months) initiation of therapy. METHODS: Children with ulcerative
      colitis treated with AZA within 24 months of diagnosis were included.
      Corticosteroid (CS)-free remission and mucosal healing (MH), assessed by
      endoscopy or fecal calprotectin, at 12 months were the primary outcomes. Patients
      were also compared for CS-free remission and MH, need for treatment escalation or
      surgery, number of hospitalizations, and adverse events during a 24-month
      follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 121 children entered the study (median age 10.5
      +/- 4.0 years, 59% girls). Seventy-six (63%) started AZA between 0 and 6 months
      (early group) and 45 (37%) started between 6 and 24 months (late group).
      Seventy-five percent and 53% of patients in the early and late group,
      respectively, received CS at the diagnosis (P = 0.01). CS-free remission at 1
      year was achieved by 30 (50%) of the early and 23 (57%) of the late patients (P =
      0.54). MH occurred in 37 (37%) patients at 1 year, with no difference between the
      2 groups (33% early, 42% late; P = 0.56). No difference was found for the other
      outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Introduction of AZA within 6 months of diagnosis seems not
      more effective than later treatment to achieve CS-free remission in pediatric
      ulcerative colitis. MH does not depend on the timing of AZA initiation; however, 
      because of the incomplete comparability of the 2 groups at the diagnosis and the 
      use of fecal calprotectin as a surrogate marker of MH, our results should be
      further confirmed by prospective studies.

TI  - An Antibody Against Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 1 (TREM-1)
      Dampens Proinflammatory Cytokine Secretion by Lamina Propria Cells from Patients 
      with IBD.
PG  - 1803-11
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000822 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1) is a potent
      amplifier of inflammation. Recently, the antimicrobial peptide PGLYRP-1 was shown
      to be the ligand of TREM-1. Here, the ability of an anti-TREM-1 antibody to
      dampen the release of proinflammatory cytokines by colon lamina propria cells
      (LPCs) from patients with IBD was investigated and correlated with PGLYRP-1
      levels. METHODS: Biopsies from patients with ulcerative colitis (UC, n = 45) or
      Crohn's disease (CD, n = 26) were compared with those from individuals undergoing
      colonoscopy for other reasons (n = 17). TREM-1 expression was analyzed on myeloid
      cells by flow cytometry. Cell culture experiments with LPCs were used to analyze 
      PGLYRP-1 and inflammatory cytokine levels and assess the effect of anti-TREM-1 on
      cytokine secretion. RESULTS: The frequency of TREM-1-expressing neutrophils and
      recruited macrophages was higher in inflamed than in noninflamed biopsies. The
      PGLYRP-1 level in inflamed tissue was higher than in noninflamed tissue; it was
      produced primarily by neutrophils, and its level correlated with the secretion of
      proinflammatory cytokines. Secretion of myeloperoxidase, tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, and interleukin-8 by LPCs stimulated with the
      potent TREM-1 agonist consisting of PGLYRP-1 complexed with peptidoglycan was
      reduced in the presence of anti-TREM-1. Moreover, a blocking effect of
      anti-TREM-1 was apparent when LPCs from a subset of inflamed individuals with
      elevated PGLYRP-1 were stimulated with killed bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: An
      anti-TREM-1 antibody can dampen secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in
      inflamed patients with elevated PGLYRP-1. Moreover, PGLYRP-1 + myeloperoxidase is
      a potential biomarker for predicting the effect of anti-TREM-1 therapy.

TI  - Predictors of Pouchitis After Ileal Pouch-Anal Anastomosis in Children.
PG  - e58-62
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000001279 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Predictive factors for the development of pouchitis after ileal
      pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) in children have not been well studied. In this
      retrospective study, the incidence and risk factors that predict pouchitis in
      children with IPAA will be identified. METHODS: The records of patients who
      underwent IPAA surgery at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin between January 2000
      and December 2013 were reviewed retrospectively. Patients with clinical,
      endoscopic, and histological findings consistent with pouchitis were identified. 
      The groups of patients with and without pouchitis or chronic pouchitis were
      compared to determine which demographic, pathological, or disease characteristics
      may serve as predictive factors for the development of pouchitis or chronic
      pouchitis. RESULTS: Out of a total of 60 patients who underwent IPAA,
      preoperative diagnosis was ulcerative colitis (UC) in 43 and familial adenomatous
      polyposis (FAP) in 17. Pouchitis was identified in 24 (56%) patients with UC and 
      2 (12%) patients with FAP. Subgroup analysis of patients with UC revealed that
      chronic pouchitis occurred in 15 (35%) patients. The median follow-up period from
      construction of the IPAA was 35 months (range 4.59-104.26 months). The study
      analysis revealed that a higher Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index score
      at the time of diagnosis was a significant predictive factor for both pouchitis
      (P = 0.001) and chronic pouchitis (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with UC and a
      higher PUCAI score at the time of diagnosis have a higher risk for developing
      pouchitis.

TI  - (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate decreases colonic inflammation and permeability in
      a mouse model of colitis, but reduces macronutrient digestion and exacerbates
      weight loss.
PG  - 2267-2274
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201501042 [doi]
AB  - SCOPE: (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) has been reported to have putative
      health effects including the prevention of inflammation and obesity.
      Historically, polyphenols have been regarded as antinutritionals and while such
      effects may be beneficial in obese subjects, they may be deleterious in
      nutritionally compromised individuals. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined the
      effect of EGCG in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-treated mouse model of
      ulcerative colitis. Following induction of colitis, mice were treated with EGCG
      (3.2 mg/g) as the sole source of drinking fluid for 3 days. EGCG treatment
      mitigated DSS-induced colon shortening and spleen enlargement. EGCG also
      decreased colonic protein levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha, as well as colonic lipid peroxides compared to DSS-treated
      controls. We observed that EGCG reduced DSS-induced gastrointestinal
      permeability. These beneficial effects were offset by enhanced body weight loss
      in EGCG-treated mice compared to DSS-treated controls. These effects were related
      to decreased protein and lipid digestion in EGCG-treated mice compared to
      DSS-treated controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that although EGCG may
      exert anti-inflammatory effects, its ability to modulate macronutrient digestion 
      may represent a dose-limiting adverse effect that must be considered in the
      context of its use for treating inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Composition and function of the pediatric colonic mucosal microbiome in untreated
      patients with ulcerative colitis.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic intestinal inflammatory disorders
      characterized by a complex disruption of the physiologic interaction between the 
      host immune system and intestinal microbes precipitated by environmental factors.
      Numerous observations indicate the altered composition and function of the
      intestinal microbiome of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), a subtype of IBD.
      The accuracy of these results may be limited by confounding factors, such as
      concurrent medication use. To address these limitations, we examined the colonic 
      mucosal microbiome of pediatric patients with UC prior to initiating treatment.
      Based on bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we identified a significant decrease
      in the phylum Verrucomicrobia in patients with UC. At the genus level, we
      observed a significant decrease in the short chain fatty acid producer Roseburia.
      Despite these compositional changes, we did not identify inferred gene content
      differences between the UC and control groups. To determine if microbial taxa may
      be associated with clinical outcomes, we retrospectively assessed the clinical
      course of the UC patients. Despite similar metrics of OTU richness and diversity,
      multiple OTU differences were observed between patients who responded to therapy 
      and those who did not. Our observations regarding the mucosal microbiome and the 
      associations with differential clinical outcomes support the contributions of gut
      microbes to disease onset and modulation.

AB  - Over the past 20 years, a growing amount of evidence supports the role of
      microbes and an imbalanced microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). While 
      many reviews have been written on the microbiota in IBD, few have considered how 
      they fulfil the Koch's postulates. In this review, we consider how the Koch's
      postulates might be modified so that they can be fulfilled for polymicrobial
      diseases, and we discuss the progress made to date in fulfilling them.

TI  - Correlation of Serum Vitamin A Levels with Disease Activity Indices and Colonic
      IL-23R and FOXP3 mRNA Expression in Ulcerative Colitis Patients.
PG  - 110-7
LID - 10.1111/sji.12450 [doi]
AB  - Genome-wide association studies have identified IL-23 receptor (IL-23R) as a
      susceptibility locus for the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC), which is
      characterized by exaggerated Th2/Th17 response. Studies have shown that vitamin A
      (VA) reduces disease progression by promoting FOXP3(+) T cells and curbing Th17
      cells. In this study, we explored the association of colonic IL-23R and FOXP3
      expression in fifty-one UC patients (23 in remission and 28 with active disease) 
      with serum VA levels and disease activity. We observed that decreased serum VA
      levels were associated with increased disease activity. However, there was no
      significant difference in mucosal IL-23R and FOXP3 expression in UC patients with
      moderate-to-severe disease activity compared to those in remission. Also, no
      significant correlation was drawn between serum VA levels and mucosal IL-23R and 
      FOXP3 expression. Our study suggests that even after an established role of VA in
      inhibiting Th17 responses in mice models and humans, serum VA levels and disease 
      activity do not correlate with FOXP3 and IL-23R expression in colonic mucosa of
      UC patients.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease, cancer and medication: Cancer risk in the Dutch
      population-based IBDSL cohort.
PG  - 1270-80
LID - 10.1002/ijc.30183 [doi]
AB  - The management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has changed since the
      mid-1990s (e.g., use of thiopurines/anti-TNFalpha agents, improved surveillance
      programs), possibly affecting cancer risk. To establish current cancer risk in
      IBD, updates are warranted from cohorts covering this time span, and detailed
      enough to study associations with phenotype and medication. We studied
      intestinal-, extra-intestinal- and overall cancer risk in the Dutch
      population-based IBDSL cohort. In total, 1,157 Crohn's disease (CD) and 1,644
      ulcerative colitis (UC) patients were diagnosed between 1991 and 2011, and
      followed until 2013. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for CD 
      and UC separately, as well as for gender-, phenotype-, disease duration-,
      diagnosis era- and medication groups. We found an increased risk for colorectal
      cancer in CD patients with colon involvement (SIR 2.97; 95% CI 1.08-6.46), but
      not in the total CD or UC population. In addition, CD patients were at increased 
      risk for hematologic- (2.41; 1.04-4.76), overall skin- (1.55; 1.06-2.19), skin
      squamous cell- (SCC; 3.83; 1.83-7.04) and overall cancer (1.28; 1.01-1.60),
      whereas UC patients had no increased risk for extra-intestinal- and overall
      cancer. Finally, in a medication analysis on CD and UC together, long-term
      immunosuppression exposure (>12 months) was associated with an increased risk for
      hematologic cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, SCC and overall cancer, and this
      increase was mainly attributed to thiopurines. IBD patients with long-term
      immunosuppression exposure can be considered as having a higher cancer risk, and 
      our data support the advice in recent IBD guidelines to consider skin cancer
      screening in these patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease of
      multifactorial etiology that primarily affects the colonic mucosa. The disease
      progresses over time, and clinical management guidelines should reflect its
      dynamic nature. There is limited evidence supporting UC management in specific
      clinical situations, thus precluding an evidence-based approach. AIM: To use a
      formal consensus method - the nominal group technique (NGT) - to develop a
      clinical practice expert opinion to outline simple algorithms and practices,
      optimize UC management, and assist clinicians in making treatment decisions.
      METHODS: The consensus was developed by an expert panel of 37 gastroenterologists
      from various professional organizations with experience in UC management using
      the qualitative and iterative NGT, incorporating deliberations based on the
      European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation recommendations, recent reviews of
      scientific literature, and pertinent discussion topics developed by a steering
      committee. Examples of clinical cases for which there are limited evidence-based 
      data from clinical trials were used. Two working groups proposed and voted on
      treatment algorithms that were then discussed and voted for by the nominal group 
      as a whole, in order to reach a consensus. RESULTS: A clinical practice guideline
      covering management of the following clinical situations was developed: (i)
      moderate and severe UC; (ii) acute severe UC; (iii) pouchitis; (iv) refractory
      proctitis, in the form of treatment algorithms. CONCLUSIONS: Given the limited
      available evidence-based data, a formal consensus methodology was used to develop
      simple treatment guidelines for UC management in different clinical situations
      that is now accessible via an online application.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The effect of adiposity on bone mass in the early phases of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children and adolescents is unclear. The aim 
      of this study was to determine the role of adiposity on bone mass in the first 3 
      y of diagnosis of IBD. The expected result is that increased adiposity will be
      associated with increased bone mass in both the controls and IBD subjects.
      METHODS: Height-adjusted bone mineral density (BMD) z-scores of 25 subjects, age 
      13.97 +/- 2.70 y, diagnosed with IBD for <4 y were compared to 24 controls, age
      13.65 +/- 2.60 y. Overweight was defined as BMI of >/=85th but <95th percentile, 
      and obesity as BMI >/=95th percentile. Severity of IBD was determined by the
      Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index and Lichtiger Colitis Activity Index.
      RESULTS: Before stratification by BMI criterion, height-adjusted BMD z-scores
      were not significantly lower in IBD subjects versus controls for both the femoral
      neck (-0.8 +/- 1.1 versus -0.06 +/- 1.1, P = 0.070) and lumbar vertebrae (-0.4
      +/- 1.2 versus 0.2 +/- 1.2, P = 0.086). Following stratification, height-adjusted
      BMD z-scores were significantly lower in the overweight/obese IBD subjects versus
      overweight/obese controls for femoral neck (-0.9 +/- 0.9 versus 0.3 +/- 1.3, P = 
      0.032); and non-significantly lower for the lumbar spine z-score (-0.4 +/- 1.6
      versus 0.5 +/- 1.3, P = 0.197). BMD z-score had no relationship with the duration
      of disease, steroid therapy, and the severity of disease. CONCLUSION: Adiposity
      was associated with reduced bone mass in the early phases of IBD, but with
      increased bone mass in the controls.

TI  - pANCA and ASCA in Children with IBD-Unclassified, Crohn's Colitis, and Ulcerative
      Colitis-A Longitudinal Report from the IBD Porto Group of ESPGHAN.
PG  - 1908-14
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000784 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: No study to date has evaluated perinuclear antineutrophil
      cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA) and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA) in
      pediatric inflammatory bowel disease-unclassified (IBDU) as compared with Crohn's
      colitis (CC) and ulcerative colitis (UC), which represent the diagnostic
      challenge. We aimed to explore the diagnostic utility of serology and to assess
      whether serology can predict disease severity in these subgroups. METHODS: This
      was a multicenter retrospective longitudinal study including 406 children with
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) from 23 centers affiliated with the Porto group
      of European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (mean
      age 10.5 +/- 3.9, 54% males); 117 (29%) with CC, 143 (35%) with UC, and 146 (36%)
      with IBDU. Median follow-up period was 2.8 years (interquartile range, 1.6-4.2). 
      RESULTS: The most prevalent serologic profile in IBDU was pANCA-/ASCA- (41%),
      followed by pANCA+/ASCA- (34%) and pANCA-/ASCA+ (17%). pANCA-/ASCA+
      differentiated well between CC versus IBDU (83% specificity, 96% positive
      predictive value [PPV]) and UC (97% specificity, 90% PPV) patients, albeit with a
      low negative predictive value (13% and 40%, respectively). pANCA+/ASCA- did not
      differentiate as well between IBD subgroups, but UC children with pANCA+/ASCA-
      had more often severe disease at diagnosis (36 [62%] versus 22 [38%], P = 0.033) 
      and needed more often calcineurin inhibitors, biologics, or colectomy (25 [80%]
      versus 6 [20%], P = 0.026). In CC, double positivity for ASCA and not
      pANCA-/ASCA+ profile was associated with disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: Serology 
      may have some role in predicting disease course and outcomes in colonic IBD, but 
      its routine use needs to be supported by more studies. Serology cannot routinely 
      be recommended for differentiating between IBDU versus CC or UC as a sole
      diagnostic criterion given its low diagnostic utility.

TI  - Timing of Last Preoperative Dose of Infliximab Does Not Increase Postoperative
      Complications in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients.
PG  - 2602-7
LID - 10.1007/s10620-016-4171-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The association between preoperative use of infliximab and
      postoperative complications in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is 
      a subject of continued debate. Results from studies examining an association
      between the timing of last preoperative dose of infliximab and postoperative
      complications remain inconsistent. AIMS: To assess whether timing of last dose of
      infliximab prior to surgery affects the rate of postoperative complications in
      patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Retrospective chart
      review of IBD patients who have undergone surgery while receiving therapy with
      infliximab was conducted. Forty-seven patients were included in the analysis.
      RESULTS: No significant association was found between timing of infliximab and
      the rate of postoperative complications. Age, gender, disease type, steroid use, 
      preoperative status, surgery type, or surgeon type was not associated with
      increased rate of postoperative complications. CONCLUSION: Timing of last dose of
      infliximab does not affect the rate of postoperative complications in patients
      with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.

AB  - Survey aims were to investigate the dietary concerns, beliefs and opinions of
      people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and differences between those with 
      Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). A cross-sectional postal
      questionnaire was sent to people with IBD who were booked into an adult IBD or
      Gastroenterology clinic over a 6-week period. There were 416 eligible people and 
      168 (40%) responded. Sixty-four (42%) people indicated that food affects their
      symptoms a lot or severely. Eighty (51%) respondents indicated that diet was
      important or extremely important in controlling symptoms. Significantly more
      people with CD reported meat, fatty foods, chocolate and salad as a trigger than 
      people with UC. Significantly more people with UC reported wheat as a trigger.
      More people with CD avoided meat and chocolate than UC. This survey highlights
      the importance of nutrition and diet to people with IBD. Frequent food avoidance 
      was reported. This may impact on nutrition-related health problems.

TI  - The prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome-type symptoms in paediatric
      inflammatory bowel disease, and the relationship with biochemical markers of
      disease activity.
PG  - 181-8
LID - 10.1111/apt.13636 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A large proportion (25-46%) of adults with inflammatory bowel disease
      in remission has symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which are thought to
      reflect ongoing inflammation. Data on paediatric inflammatory bowel disease
      patients are lacking. AIM: To investigate (i) the prevalence of IBS-type symptoms
      in paediatric inflammatory bowel disease patients in remission and (ii) the
      relationship of IBS-type symptoms with biochemical markers of disease activity.
      METHODS: This cross-sectional study included all patients (<18 years) with
      Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis attending the out-patient clinic of one of 
      three Dutch hospitals between March 2014 and June 2015. Clinical disease activity
      was determined using the abbreviated-PCDAI or PUCAI. Biochemical disease activity
      was assessed using faecal calprotectin and serum CRP. IBS-symptoms were assessed 
      using physician-administered Rome III-questionnaires. RESULTS: We included 184
      patients (92 female; mean age: 14.5 years) (Crohn's disease: 123, ulcerative
      colitis: 61). The prevalence of IBS-type symptoms in children with inflammatory
      bowel disease in clinical remission was 6.4% (95% CI: 2.5-11.1%; Crohn's disease:
      4.5%; ulcerative colitis: 10.8%). Prevalence of IBS-type symptoms in children
      with faecal calprotectin <250 mug/g was 16.1% (95% CI: 7.6-25.8%; Crohn's
      disease: 16.7%; ulcerative colitis: 10.8%). No difference in faecal calprotectin 
      or CRP was found between patients in clinical remission with or without IBS-type 
      symptoms (faecal calprotectin: IBS+ median 58 mug/g, IBS- 221 mug/g, P = 0.12;
      CRP: IBS+ median 1.4 mg/L, IBS- 1.1 mg/L, P = 0.63). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence 
      of IBS-type symptoms in children with inflammatory bowel disease is highly
      dependent on the definition of remission. Nonetheless, the prevalence is much
      lower than that previously reported in studies in adult inflammatory bowel
      disease patients. IBS-type symptoms appear to be unrelated to gastrointestinal
      inflammation.

TI  - L-Arginine Availability and Metabolism Is Altered in Ulcerative Colitis.
PG  - 1847-58
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000790 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: L-arginine (L-Arg) is the substrate for both inducible nitric oxide
      (NO) synthase (NOS2) and arginase (ARG) enzymes. L-Arg is actively transported
      into cells by means of cationic amino acid transporter (SLC7) proteins. We have
      linked L-Arg and arginase 1 activity to epithelial restitution. Our aim was to
      determine if L-Arg, related amino acids, and metabolic enzymes are altered in
      ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Serum and colonic tissues were prospectively
      collected from 38 control subjects and 137 UC patients. Dietary intake,
      histologic injury, and clinical disease activity were assessed. Amino acid levels
      were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Messenger RNA (mRNA)
      levels were measured by real-time PCR. Colon tissue samples from 12 Crohn's
      disease patients were obtained for comparison. RESULTS: Dietary intake of
      arginine and serum L-Arg levels were not different in UC patients versus control 
      subjects. In active UC, tissue L-Arg was decreased, whereas L-citrulline (L-Cit) 
      and the L-Cit/L-Arg ratio were increased. This pattern was also seen when paired 
      involved (left) versus uninvolved (right) colon tissues in UC were assessed. In
      active UC, SLC7A2 and ARG1 mRNA levels were decreased, whereas ARG2 and NOS2 were
      increased. Similar alterations in mRNA expression occurred in tissues from
      Crohn's disease patients. In involved UC, SLC7A2 and ARG1 mRNA levels were
      decreased, and NOS2 and ARG2 increased, when compared with uninvolved tissues.
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients with UC exhibit diminished tissue L-Arg, likely
      attributable to decreased cellular uptake and increased consumption by NOS2.
      These findings combined with decreased ARG1 expression indicate a pattern of
      dysregulated L-Arg availability and metabolism in UC.

TI  - Interobserver Variation Study of the Rutgeerts Score to Assess Endoscopic
      Recurrence after Surgery for Crohn's Disease.
PG  - 1001-5
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjw082 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: After resection surgery for Crohn's disease, recurrence of endoscopic
      lesions at the site of the anastomosis or in the neoterminal ileum is graded
      according to the Rutgeerts score (RS). The goal of this study was to test the
      interobserver variability for RS. METHODS: Thirteen trained endoscopists
      evaluated the RS on 39 videotapes of patients who had undergone resection for
      Crohn's disease with an ileocolonic anastomosis 6 months earlier. Videotapes were
      randomly assigned to endoscopists through a balanced incomplete block design.
      Each videotape was scored independently by four endoscopists, and each
      endoscopist evaluated 12 videotapes, making a total of 156 videotape assessments.
      Reproducibility levels of the RS were assessed through unweighted kappa estimates
      among multiple raters. The proportion of inappropriate therapeutic initiation was
      estimated by randomly selecting one endoscopist for each videorecording, assuming
      that the majority of endoscopists correctly classified endoscopic recurrence.
      RESULTS: The kappa estimates were 0.43 (95% confidence interval: 0.33-0.52) for
      the RS on a 5-grade scale, 0.47 (0.28-0.66) for RS < i2 vs. >/= i2, and 0.64
      (0.42-0.85) for RS </= i2 vs. > i2. The percentages of inappropriate therapeutic 
      initiation were 12.8% (3.8-21.9) when initiation was triggered by a RS >/= i2 and
      8.3% (1.1-15.6) when initiation was triggered by a RS > i2 (p = 0.41).
      CONCLUSION: The reproducibility of the RS was moderate, especially when
      differentiating <i2 from >/=i2, which may lead to incorrect therapeutic decisions
      in >10% of patients.

TI  - Genomic Alterations Observed in Colitis-Associated Cancers Are Distinct From
      Those Found in Sporadic Colorectal Cancers and Vary by Type of Inflammatory Bowel
      Disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's
      disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are at increased risk for small bowel
      or colorectal cancers (colitis-associated cancers [CACs]). We compared the
      spectrum of genomic alterations in CACs with those of sporadic colorectal cancers
      (CRCs) and investigated differences between CACs from patients with CD vs UC.
      METHODS: We studied tumor tissues from patients with CACs treated at Memorial
      Sloan Kettering Cancer Center or Weill Cornell Medical College from 2003 through 
      2015. We performed hybrid capture-based next-generation sequencing analysis of
      >300 cancer-related genes to comprehensively characterize genomic alterations.
      RESULTS: We performed genomic analyses of 47 CACs (from 29 patients with UC and
      18 with CD; 43 primary tumors and 4 metastases). Primary tumors developed in the 
      ileum (n = 2), right colon (n = 18), left colon (n = 6), and rectosigmoid or
      rectum (n = 21). We found genomic alterations in TP53, IDH1, and MYC to be
      significantly more frequent, and mutations in APC to be significantly less
      frequent, than those reported in sporadic CRCs by The Cancer Genome Atlas or
      Foundation Medicine. We identified genomic alterations that might be targeted by 
      a therapeutic agent in 17 of 47 (36%) CACs. These included the mutation encoding 
      IDH1 R132; amplification of FGFR1, FGFR2, and ERBB2; and mutations encoding BRAF 
      V600E and an EML4-ALK fusion protein. Alterations in IDH1 and APC were
      significantly more common in CACs from patients with CD than UC. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      an analysis of CACs from 47 patients, we found significant differences in the
      spectrum of genomic alterations in CACs compared with sporadic CRCs. We observed 
      a high frequency of IDH1 R132 mutations in patients with CD but not UC, as well
      as a high frequency of MYC amplification in CACs. Many genetic alterations
      observed in CACs could serve as therapeutic targets.

TI  - Colonic stenting as a bridge to surgery for obstructive colorectal cancer:
      advantages and disadvantages.
PG  - 1310-7
LID - 10.1007/s00595-016-1333-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To clarify the advantages and disadvantages of stenting as a bridge to
      surgery (BTS) by comparing the clinical features and outcomes of patients who
      underwent BTS with those of patients who underwent emergency surgery (ES).
      METHODS: We assessed technical success, clinical success, surgical procedures,
      stoma formation, complications, clinicopathological features, and Onodera's
      prognostic nutritional index (OPNI) in patients who underwent BTS and those who
      underwent ES. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients underwent stenting, which was
      successful in 22 (BTS group). The remaining four patients with unsuccessful
      stenting underwent emergency surgery. A total of 22 patients underwent emergency 
      surgery (ES group). The rates of technical and clinical success were 85.0 and
      81.0 %, respectively. The proportion of patients able to be treated by
      laparoscopic surgery (P = 0.0001) and avoid colostomy (P = 0.0042) was
      significantly higher in the BTS group. Although the incidence of anastomotic
      leakage in the two groups was not significantly different, it was significantly
      reduced by colonoscopic evaluation of obstructive colitis (P = 0.0251). The mean 
      number of harvested lymph nodes (P = 0.0056) and the proportion of D3
      lymphadenectomy (P = 0.0241) were significantly greater in the BTS group.
      Perineural invasion (PNI) was noted in 59.1 and 18.2 % of the BTS group and ES
      group patients, respectively (P = 0.0053). OPNI and serum albumin decreased
      significantly after stenting (P = 0.0084). CONCLUSIONS: The advantages of
      stenting as a BTS were that it avoided colostomy and allowed for laparoscopic
      surgery and lymphadenectomy, whereas its disadvantage lay in the decreased PNI
      and OPNI levels. A larger study including an analysis of prognosis is warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: IgG4-mediated pouchitis was first described in 2011. The
      aetiology and pathogenesis of IgG4-associated pouchitis is unknown. Over the last
      four years, less than seventy cases of IgG-associated pouchitis have been
      reported from a pouchitis clinic in Cleveland. METHODS: We report the first two
      cases of IgG4-associated pouchitis from our inflammatory bowel disease clinic and
      outside of Cleveland. CONCLUSION: This highlights the fact that this entity could
      be more common than we think. It is important for general gastroenterologists to 
      think about IgG4-mediated disease if the patient has refractory pouchitis, so
      early diagnosis and referral can be made. This would avoid the cost of expensive 
      therapy and minimize antibiotic use which is what happened in our cases prior to 
      this diagnosis being made.

TI  - Effect of Psychotherapy on Health Care Utilization in Children With Inflammatory 
      Bowel Disease and Depression.
PG  - 658-664
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at an
      increased risk of developing depression compared with community controls.
      Depression often negatively influences illness behaviors such as resource
      utilization. We sought to investigate the effects of treating depression on
      utilization of medical resources in depressed pediatric patients with IBD by
      comparing rates of health care utilization 1 year before and after psychotherapy.
      METHOD: Two hundred seventeen subjects ages 9 to 17 years with IBD and depression
      received 3 months of psychotherapy for depression as part of a multicenter
      randomized controlled trial. Of these 217 subjects, 70 had utilization data
      available 1 year prior and 1 year after receiving 3 months of psychotherapy.
      Primary outcomes included frequency of hospitalizations, inpatient hospital days,
      outpatient gastrointestinal visits, and number of emergency room visits,
      radiological examinations, and endoscopies. Within subject analyses were
      completed comparing health care utilization 12 months before psychotherapy
      compared with the 12 months after the conclusion of psychotherapy. RESULTS:
      Fifty-one and 19 patients had CD and UC, respectively. A total of 55.7% of
      patients had major depression and 44.3% had minor depression. Overall, all study 
      measures of health care utilization were significantly reduced after
      psychotherapy (P < 0.01)-including gastrointestinal-related (mean values)
      hospitalization frequency, inpatient days, outpatient visit, emergency room
      visits, radiological examinations, and endoscopies. CONCLUSIONS: Psychotherapy
      for comorbid depression in pediatric patients with IBD is associated with
      decreased GI-related health care utilization. The present study highlights the
      importance of screening for depression in a pediatric population with IBD, and
      that psychotherapy may be a reasonable adjunctive treatment for pediatric
      patients with IBD and comorbid depression.

TI  - Comparison of anti-inflammatory mechanisms of mango (Mangifera Indica L.) and
      pomegranate (Punica Granatum L.) in a preclinical model of colitis.
PG  - 1912-23
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201501008 [doi]
AB  - SCOPE: Tannin-rich fruits have been evaluated as alternative prevention
      strategies for colorectal cancer based on their anti-inflammatory properties.
      This study compared tannin-rich preparations from mango (rich in gallotannins)
      and pomegranate (rich in ellagitannins) in the dextran sodium sulfate-induced
      colitis model. METHODS AND RESULTS: In rats, mango and pomegranate beverages
      decreased intestinal inflammation and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in
      mucosa and serum. The mango beverage suppressed the ratio of phosphorylated/total
      protein expression of the IGF-1R-AKT/mTOR axis and downregulated mRNA expression 
      of Igf1, Insr, and pik3cv. Pomegranate decreased p70S6K and RPS6, as well as
      Rps6ka2, Map2k2, and Mapk1 mRNA. In silico modeling indicated a high binding of
      docked of gallic acid to the catalytic domain of IGF-1R, which may suppress the
      activity of the enzyme. Ellagic acid docked effectively into the catalytic
      domains of both IGF-1R and EGFR. In vitro assays with lipopolysaccharide-treated 
      CCD-18Co cells using polyphenolic extracts from each beverage, as well as pure
      compounds, corroborated the predictions made in silico. CONCLUSION: Mango
      polyphenols inhibited the IGF-1R- AKT/mTOR axis, and pomegranate polyphenols
      downregulate the mTOR downstream pathway through reductions in ERK1/2. These
      results suggest that extracts rich in gallo- and ellagitannins act on different
      molecular targets in the protection against ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Early Mucosal Healing with Exclusive Enteral Nutrition is Associated with
      Improved Outcomes in Newly Diagnosed Children with Luminal Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1159-64
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjw075 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Exclusive Enteral Nutrition (EEN) induction in children with luminal 
      Crohn's disease (CD) gives early mucosal healing (MH), but the long-term benefits
      of EEN-induced MH are just emerging. AIMS & METHODS: We prospectively followed an
      Australian cohort of newly diagnosed children with predominantly luminal CD who
      completed at least six weeks EEN and with paired clinical Pediatric Crohn's
      Disease Activity Index (PCDAI), biochemical (C-reactive protein; CRP) and
      endoscopic assessment at diagnosis and post EEN. All commenced immunomodulators
      (IMs) early (<3 months from diagnosis) and had a minimum of 1 year follow-up.
      Complete MH was a simple endoscopic score for Crohn's disease (SES-CD) of 0, and 
      SES-CD>/=1 was ascribed to active endoscopic disease (aED) and further divided
      into near complete MH (SES 1-3), mild active disease (SES-CD 4-10) and moderate
      to severe disease (SES-CD>10). The primary outcome was long-term supervised
      sustained remission (SR) on IMs alone without need for corticosteroids,
      infliximab (IFX) or surgery. RESULTS: A total of 54 eligible children (33 males) 
      completing EEN induction were analysed. The median duration between pre and post 
      EEN assessments was 60.5 days [interquartile range (IQR), 56-69.5]. Post EEN:
      clinical remission (PCDAI < 10) was observed in 45/54 (83%), and biochemical
      remission (PCDAI < 10 and CRP < 5 mg/dl) was observed in 39/54 (72%). Complete MH
      was observed in 18/54 (33%), near complete in 10/54(19%). SR was superior in
      those with complete MH vs. aED; 13/18, (72%) vs. 10/36 (28%), p = 0.003 at 1
      year, 8/16, (50%) vs. 3/24, (8%), p = 0.008 at 2 years and (8/16, (50%) vs. 1/19,
      (6%), p = 0.005) at 3 years. Near-complete MH did not lead to superior SR.
      CONCLUSIONS: Only complete MH post EEN induction predicts more favourable SR for 
      up to 3 years.

TI  - The Fate of Reconstructive Surgery Following Colectomy for Inflammatory Bowel
      Disease in Sweden: A Population-based Cohort Study.
PG  - 1165-71
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjw073 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Previous studies describing the cumulative failure rate
      after reconstructive surgery in patients with inflammatory bowel disease have
      been restricted to specific hospitals, and the generalizability of these results 
      in a population-based setting is unknown. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the cumulative failure rate and risk factors for failure after
      reconstructive surgery in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: The 
      study cohort includes all patients with inflammatory bowel disease in Sweden who 
      underwent colectomy in 2000 through 2013 who were later treated with
      reconstructive surgery with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis or ileorectal
      anastomosis. Each patient was followed from admission for reconstructive surgery 
      until admission for failure (a diverting stoma or permanent stoma), date of
      death, migration or December 31, 2013. Cumulative failure distributions were
      obtained with the Kaplan-Meier method, and multivariable Cox regression models
      were used to calculate the risk of failure. RESULTS: Of the 1809 patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease treated with colectomy and reconstructive surgery, 83%
      had ulcerative colitis. During follow-up, 270 patients failed, and the cumulative
      failure rate was 4.1%, 13.2%, and 15.3% after 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively.
      The risk of failure was lower after treatment with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis
      than with ileorectal anastomosis [hazard ratio (95% confidence interval): 0.72
      (0.56-0.93)]. Gender, hospital volume, and timing of reconstruction were not
      significantly associated with the risk of failure. CONCLUSIONS: The 5-year
      cumulative failure rate in a nationwide setting was 15.3%, and hospital volume
      was not associated with the risk of failure.

TI  - Step-up fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) strategy.
PG  - 323-328
AB  - Gut dysbiosis is a characteristic of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and is
      believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of IBD. Fecal microbiota
      transplantation (FMT) is an effective strategy to restore intestinal microbial
      diversity and has been reported to have a potential therapeutic value in IBD. Our
      recent study reported a holistic integrative therapy called "step-up FMT
      strategy," which was beneficial in treating steroid-dependent IBD patients. This 
      strategy consists of scheduled FMTs combined with steroids, anti-TNF-alpha
      antibody treatment or enteral nutrition. Herein, we will elaborate the strategy
      thoroughly, introducing the concept, potential indication, methodology, and
      safety of "step-up FMT strategy" in detail.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Diet assessment is essential in the care of patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We aimed to study food intake in children with 
      IBD and evaluated the relation of dietary intake with disease activity and
      nutritional status in these children. METHODS: This cross-sectional study
      investigated 68 children and adolescents with IBD (57 Crohn disease, 11
      ulcerative colitis). Evaluation included clinical, laboratory, and nutritional
      assessment including 3 days diet record. RESULTS: Compared with recommended daily
      allowance, the intake of patients with IBD was significantly poor for
      carbohydrates (75%, P = 0.016), calcium (49%, P < 0.05), magnesium (76%, P <
      0.05), vitamin A (72%, P < 0.05), vitamin E (57%, P < 0.05), and fiber (44%, P < 
      0.05) and higher for protein (175%, P < 0.05), iron (112%, P < 0.05), and
      water-soluble vitamins (118%-189% P < 0.05). Compared with the intakes of healthy
      children from National Nutritional Survey, the intake of IBD group was lower for 
      calories (78%, P = 0.012), carbohydrates (61% P < 0.05), magnesium (67% P <
      0.05), vitamin C (34%, P < 0.05), and fiber (54%, P < 0.05) and high for B12
      (141%, P < 0.05). Fifty subjects ate ordinary diets, 7 of 68 children were on
      exclusive enteral nutrition and 11 of 68 consumed regular food with different
      polymeric formulas supplements. Compared with children without supplements,
      children on exclusive enteral nutrition and nutritional supplements (18/68) had
      significantly better intakes of energy (1870 +/- 755 vs 2267 +/- 432, P < 0.05), 
      carbohydrates (223 +/- 97 vs 292 +/- 99, P < 0.05), and all minerals (P < 0.05)
      and micronutrients (P < 0.05). Dietary intake was not different by disease status
      (remission or relapse). CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of nutritional supplements,
      food intake is inadequate for many nutrients in many children with IBD.

TI  - Plasma intestinal fatty acid-binding protein fails to predict endoscopic disease 
      activity in inflammatory bowel disease patients.
PG  - 807-13
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0000000000000616 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Monitoring disease activity in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is of
      major importance to prevent long-term complications. Intestinal fatty
      acid-binding protein (I-FABP) has been identified as a marker for intestinal
      damage and correlates with the degree of inflammation. The aim of the present
      study was to evaluate whether I-FABP can predict active disease or remission in
      Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) in a real-life IBD cohort.
      METHODS: In total, 70 patients with endoscopic disease activity available and 194
      patients with disease activity on the basis of a stringent combi-score of
      clinical activity index, C-reactive protein, and fecal calprotectin were
      included. Plasma I-FABP was compared between patients with active disease and
      remission. In a small subgroup of CD patients, follow-up samples were analyzed.
      RESULTS: In CD (139.2 vs. 119.2 pg/ml; P=0.37) and UC (107.8 vs. 151.8 pg/ml;
      P=0.33), the median I-FABP did not differ in endoscopic active disease versus
      remission. In UC patients with active disease on the basis of the combi-score,
      the median I-FABP (106.8 vs. 172.0 pg/ml; P=0.03) was significantly lower than in
      patients in remission, but not in CD (145.5 vs. 157.5 pg/ml; P=0.29). Neither
      disease location in CD nor extent of disease in UC influenced I-FABP
      significantly. I-FABP was not different (P=0.78) in CD patients with a change in 
      disease activity over time. CONCLUSION: Plasma I-FABP did not differ between
      endoscopic active disease and remission in both CD and UC. I-FABP was lower in
      active UC but not CD on the basis of the combi-score. On the basis of these
      findings, I-FABP has no potential as a novel noninvasive biomarker for disease
      activity in IBD.

TI  - Anti-TNF Therapy Response in Patients with Ulcerative Colitis Is Associated with 
      Colonic Antimicrobial Peptide Expression and Microbiota Composition.
PG  - 943-52
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjw051 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Anti-tumour necrosis factor [TNF] therapy is used in
      patients with ulcerative colitis [UC], but not all patients respond to treatment.
      Antimicrobial peptides [AMPs] and the gut microbiota are essential for gut
      homeostasis and may be important for treatment outcome. The aim of this study was
      to determine AMP and microbiota profiles in patients with UC before anti-TNF
      therapy start and correlate these data to treatment outcome. METHODS: Serum and
      biopsies were obtained from UC patients naive to biological therapy [n = 56]
      before anti-TNF therapy start [baseline]. Fecal samples were taken at baseline
      and Weeks 2 and 6. Quantitative proteomic analysis was performed in mucosal
      biopsies. Expression of AMPs and cytokines was determined in biopsies and serum. 
      Microbiota analysis of fecal samples was performed using GA-map Dysbiosis Test
      and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction [rtPCR]. Treatment response 
      was evaluated 12-14 weeks after baseline. RESULTS: At baseline, proteomic
      analysis of biopsies showed that treatment responders and non-responders had
      differential expression of AMPs. Eleven AMP and AMP-related genes were analysed
      by rtPCR in mucosal biopsies and could together discriminate responders from
      non-responders at baseline. The most important nominators for response were
      increased expression of defensin 5 and eosinophilic cationic protein. Microbiota 
      analysis revealed lower dysbiosis indexes and higher abundance of
      Faecalibacterium prausnitzii in responders compared with non-responders at
      baseline. Also, abundance of F. prausnitzii increased during induction therapy in
      responders. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-TNF therapy responders and non-responders display
      distinctly separate patterns of mucosal AMP expression and gut microbiota before 
      treatment start. This indicates that intestinal antimicrobial/microbial
      composition can influence treatment outcome.

TI  - Prediction of clinical and endoscopic responses to anti-tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha antibodies in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 934-41
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2016.1144781 [doi]
AB  - Objective In patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), the relationship between the 
      initial endoscopic findings and the response to anti-tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF)-alpha antibodies remains unclear. We herein evaluated the potential of
      endoscopic assessment using the ulcerative colitis endoscopic index of severity
      (UCEIS) to predict the response to anti-TNF-alpha antibodies. Methods We enrolled
      64 patients with UC undergoing anti-TNF-alpha maintenance therapy with infliximab
      (IFX) or adalimumab (ADA) between April 2010 and March 2015. Anti-TNF-alpha
      trough levels were determined by ELISA. Endoscopic disease activity was assessed 
      using the UCEIS. Results The clinical response rate at 8 weeks was 77.4% for IFX 
      and 66.7% for ADA. Serum albumin levels were significantly higher and the UCEIS
      bleeding descriptor before treatment was significantly lower in the responders
      than in the non-responders (p < 0.05 each). The CRP levels at 2 weeks were
      significantly lower in the responders (p < 0.001). The serum albumin levels
      before treatment were significantly higher and the UCEIS erosions and ulcers
      descriptor was significantly lower in the mucosal healing group than in the
      non-mucosal healing group (p < 0.05 each). A significant and negative correlation
      between the trough levels of anti-TNF-alpha antibodies and the UCEIS descriptors 
      was observed. The trough levels of anti-TNF-alpha antibodies to achieve mucosal
      healing were 2.7 mug/mL for IFX and 10.3 mug/mL for ADA. Conclusions The UCEIS
      score, as well as some clinical markers (serum albumin and CRP levels), is useful
      for the prediction of the treatment outcome of UC patients in response to
      anti-TNF-alpha antibodies.

TI  - Perinatal vitamin D levels are not associated with later risk of developing
      pediatric-onset inflammatory bowel disease: a Danish case-cohort study.
PG  - 927-33
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2016.1144218 [doi]
AB  - Objective Basic and epidemiologic studies on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      have suggested an association between vitamin D and IBD risk. Though, the
      literature on IBD - especially pediatric-onset IBD - and vitamin D is still in
      its cradle. We therefore wanted to examine if levels of 25(OH)D at birth were
      associated with increased risk of developing pediatric-onset IBD. Material and
      methods A case-cohort study composed of cases diagnosed with Crohn's disease,
      ulcerative colitis or indeterminate/unclassified colitis and healthy controls.
      Cases and controls were matched on date of birth and were born in the period
      1981-2004. Cases were diagnosed before the age of 18 years. The concentration of 
      25(OH)D was assessed from neonatal dried blood spots using a highly sensitive
      liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated 
      using conditional logistic regression and two-way ANOVA were used to test for
      season and birth year 25(OH)D variations. A total of 384 matched pairs were
      included in the statistical analyses. Results No significant association were
      found between levels of 25(OH)D and IBD risk in the adjusted model (OR [95% CI]
      (per 25 nmol/L increase), 1.12 [0.88; 1.42], p = 0.35). 25(OH)D levels were found
      to fluctuate significantly with season (p < 0.001) and year (p < 0.001).
      Median/Q1-Q3 values for 25(OH)D were 27.1/16.5-39.5 nmol/L for cases and
      25.7/16.1-39.4 nmol/L for controls. Conclusion Our study do not suggest that a
      window of vulnerability exist around time of birth in regards to 25(OH)D levels
      and later pediatric-onset IBD risk.

TI  - Elevated fecal levels of eosinophil granule proteins predict collagenous colitis 
      in patients referred to colonoscopy due to chronic non-bloody diarrhea.
PG  - 835-41
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2016.1141432 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Colonoscopy with biopsy sampling is often performed to detect
      collagenous colitis (CC) and lymphocytic colitis (LC) in patients with chronic
      non-bloody diarrhea. However, the diagnostic yield is low and incurs high costs. 
      Fecal calprotectin (FC) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) indicate intestinal
      inflammation in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). In CC, elevated
      fecal levels of eosinophil protein X (EPX) and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) 
      have been reported. We aimed to evaluate if F-EPX, F-ECP, FC, and F-MPO could
      predict the diagnostic outcome in patients with chronic non-bloody diarrhea
      referred to colonoscopy. We also evaluated serum (S) EPX and ECP in this regard. 
      METHODS: Of 67 included patients, 63 (94%) underwent colonoscopy with biopsy
      sampling. Fecal EPX, F-ECP, FC, F-MPO, S-EPX, and S-ECP were analyzed. RESULTS:
      Diagnostic outcome: normal: n = 46 (73%), CC: n = 9 (14%), LC: n = 4 (6%), UC: n 
      = 2 (3%), CD: n = 2 (3%). Higher levels of F-EPX and F-ECP were found in CC
      compared to a normal diagnostic outcome (p = 0.01). No change was noted in any of
      the fecal markers in LC. When all of the fecal markers were normal the
      probability of a normal diagnostic outcome was 92%. We found no differences in
      S-EPX and S-ECP between the groups. CONCLUSION: Elevated F-EPX and F-ECP could
      predict CC. None of the fecal markers predicted LC. Serum-EPX and S-ECP are not
      useful for the diagnosis of CC, LC, UC, or CD. With normal levels in all of the
      analyzed fecal markers, there is a low probability of a pathologic diagnostic
      outcome.

AB  - Infliximab (IFX) is commonly used to induce and maintain remission in
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We report the first 2 cases of children with
      ulcerative colitis who had normal liver transaminases before IFX and were
      diagnosed with immunomediated hepatitis after IFX induction. Both the cases had
      negative antibodies for antinuclear, smooth muscle, and liver kidney microsome,
      with 1 patient having positive autoimmune serology (dsDNA) and overlap primary
      sclerosing cholangitis. IFX was discontinued and transaminases normalized without
      steroid administration. Clinicians treating pediatric patients with IBD with IFX 
      should be aware of IFX immunomediated hepatitis. This phenomenon is previously
      reported in adult patients with IBD. To our knowledge, these are the first cases 
      reported in pediatric patients with IBD.

TI  - Heterogeneity in endoscopic treatment of Crohn's disease-associated strictures:
      An international inflammatory bowel disease specialist survey.
PG  - 939-48
LID - 10.1007/s00535-016-1172-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is frequently complicated by intestinal
      strictures, which are commonly treated by endoscopic balloon dilation (EBD).
      However, available data on this area of treatment is limited. The aim of this
      study was to depict the heterogeneity of endoscopic management of CD-associated
      strictures among international CD specialists to identify common treatment
      standards. METHODS: IBD experts of the International Organization for the Study
      of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IOIBD), the European Crohn's and Colitis
      Organization (ECCO), and from the Prospective Value In IBD trials (PROVIT)
      completed a web-based questionnaire to evaluate their endoscopic experience,
      practice setting, and number of EBDs performed annually. Additionally, two case
      scenarios and technical practice parameters were investigated. RESULTS: A total
      of 126 subjects from 15 countries completed the survey. The maximal length of
      dilated stricture was 4.5 +/- 1.7 cm. The most commonly used maximal balloon size
      was graded as 15-18 mm. While 87.2 % of the participants favored EBD for
      anastomotic strictures, only 58.6 % did so in the case of naive strictures. Only 
      35.7 % of physicians dilated actively inflamed strictures. Interventional
      endoscopists were more likely to dilate only clinically symptomatic strictures (p
      = 0.046). Surgeons favored surgical treatment of de novo ileocecal strictures
      compared to gastroenterologists (p = 0.026), reported a shorter stricture length 
      being amendable by EBD (p = 0.045), and more frequently used concomitant
      therapies (p = 0.001). Operator experience increased the likelihood of EBD use in
      actively inflamed strictures (p = 0.002), maximum length of stricture, and
      maximum balloon size (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: EBD is a widely used treatment
      approach for stricturing CD. Individual approaches differ significantly based on 
      background of the operator, experience level, and practice setting.

TI  - Identifying Patients at High Risk of Loss of Response to Infliximab Maintenance
      Therapy in Paediatric Crohn's Disease.
PG  - 795-804
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjw038 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Loss of response to infliximab resulting in discontinuation 
      of therapy is a frequent problem encountered in paediatric Crohn's disease.
      Although identifying patients at risk of failure could have important
      implications for follow-up, literature in this area remains sparse. Our primary
      aim was to identify predictors of loss of response to infliximab among patients
      who were responders to induction. The secondary aim was to identify predictors of
      non-response to induction. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of patients with
      paediatric Crohn's disease treated with infliximab between 2000 and 2013 was
      followed until loss of response to infliximab or transfer to adult care.
      Predictors of response to induction therapy were studied by multivariate logistic
      regression. Time to treatment failure was analysed with a multivariate Cox model.
      RESULTS: Two-hundred and forty-eight patients were eligible for the study. Of
      these, 196 (79%) were responders to induction (57% clinical remission and 22%
      clinical response) and 52 (21%) were non-responders. Steroid resistance was the
      only variable independently associated with primary non-response (odds ratio [OR]
      4.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.67-12.50, p = 0.002). Thirty-one of the 196 
      responders discontinued infliximab due to loss of response after a mean of
      1.6+/-1.3 years of treatment. Predictors of loss of response were level of
      response to induction (clinical response vs clinical remission, hazard ratio [HR]
      3.74, 95% CI 1.80-7.80, p = 0.0004) and isolated colonic disease (HR 2.72, 95% CI
      1.30-5.71, p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who fail to achieve clinical
      remission after induction and/or who have isolated colonic disease are at
      increased risk of loss of response to infliximab.

      Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
PG  - 259-64
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000001078 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Autoimmune liver disease is reported in up to 7.8% of children with
      inflammatory bowel disease. A distinct inflammatory bowel disease phenotype has
      been suggested in adults and in small pediatric cohorts. The aim of the study was
      to evaluate the features of inflammatory bowel disease associated with autoimmune
      liver diseases and to analyze the characteristics of the liver disease. METHODS: 
      Information on patients was obtained from the Italian Pediatric Inflammatory
      Bowel Disease Registry. Data of patients with and without autoimmune liver
      disease were compared. RESULTS: Autoimmune liver disease was detected in 6.8% of 
      the 677 patients enrolled and was significantly associated with the diagnosis of 
      ulcerative colitis (83%), with pancolonic involvement (84%), and with perinuclear
      antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody positivity (41%) (all Ps < 0.05). Autoimmune 
      liver disease was defined as sclerosing cholangitis in 61% of the patients and as
      an overlap syndrome in 33%. Concomitant intra- and extrahepatic biliary
      involvement was reported in 61% of cases, whereas exclusive extrahepatic lesions 
      were reported in 21%. Hepatobiliary complications were observed in 9% of the
      patients during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Autoimmune liver disease, especially
      sclerosing cholangitis, was significantly more common in patients with extensive 
      ulcerative colitis. Although complications are relatively rare in the pediatric
      age, monitoring is recommended.

LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000001079 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to explore the optimal dosing of intravenous-corticosteroids
      (IVCS) using a robust statistical method on the largest pediatric cohort of acute
      severe colitis to date. METHODS: Two hundred eighty-three children treated with
      IVCS for ulcerative colitis were included and studied for 1 year (46% boys, age
      12.1 +/- 3.9 years, disease duration 2 (interquartile range [IQR] 0-14) months,
      baseline Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index 69 +/- 13 points).
      Confounding by indication was addressed by matching high- and low-IVCS dose
      patients according to the propensity score method, using 3 cutoffs (1 mg . kg .
      methylprednisolone to 40 mg . day, 1.25 mg . kg to 50 mg . day and 2 mg . kg to
      80 mg . day). RESULTS: The median IVCS dose in the entire cohort was 1.0 mg . kg 
      . day (IQR 0.8-1.4) and 44 mg . kg . day (32-60). Ninety-four of 283 children
      were matched in the low-dose cutoff (1 mg . kg . day), 218 of 283 were matched in
      the middle cutoff (1.25 mg . kg . day), and 86/283 in the high dose cutoff (2 mg 
      . kg . day). No differences were found in 25 pretreatment baseline variables in
      the three cutoffs, implying successful matching. There were no statistical
      differences in the outcomes of the two lower cutoffs (including need for salvage 
      therapy during admission and by 1 years, admission duration, and day-5 Pediatric 
      Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index<35 points; all P > 0.05). In the high cutoff,
      the higher doses were somewhat better but this benefit reversed in a sensitivity 
      analysis excluding one center. High doses were not associated with better outcome
      also in a propensity score-weighted regression model on the entire cohort.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our data support present guidelines that doses of IVCS >1 to 1.5 mg 
      . kg . day (maximum 40-60 mg . kg . day) are not justified in acute severe
      colitis.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Treatment of acute severe colitis (ASC) has been associated with high
      morbidity and high colectomy rate in children. In the prebiologics era, our
      centre used short-term high-dose intravenous corticosteroids (IVCS) at 2 to 30 mg
      . kg . day. We conducted a retrospective review to compare efficacy of different 
      dosing regimes of IVCS. METHODS: Thirty-four children treated with IVCS for ASC
      were included over 8 years. Patients were studied as 2 groups with similar
      pretreatment patient characteristics. Group 1 (standard dose) received IVCS at 2 
      mg . kg . day and group 2 (high dose) received IVCS at 10 to 30 mg . kg . day.
      Safety, efficacy, and follow-up of the entire cohort for >1 year were studied.
      The median IVCS dose in the standard- and high-dose cohort was 1.5 mg . kg . day 
      (maximum 60 mg . kg . day) and 24.8 mg . kg . day (maximum 1000 mg . kg . day),
      respectively. RESULTS: Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index scores at day 
      5 were significantly lower in high-dose (15, interquartile range 8.5-20) than in 
      standard-dose IVCS (30, interquartile range 20-30). IVCS side effects were minor 
      and reversible. Overall, medical salvage therapy was required in 5.8% (2
      children) before discharge, and in 17% (6 children) at follow-up after 1 year.
      The colectomy rate of the entire cohort was remarkably low with 0% during
      admission and 11% (4 children) after 1 year, with a trend of less colectomies in 
      high-dose (4.8%-1 child) than in standard-dose (23%-3 children). CONCLUSIONS: Our
      data show that in paediatric ASC, the short-term use of high-dose IVCS is safe
      and effective. Prospective studies are needed to define the role of IVCS within
      salvage therapy protocols.

TI  - The effect of Clostridium butyricum MIYAIRI on the prevention of pouchitis and
      alteration of the microbiota profile in patients with ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 939-49
LID - 10.1007/s00595-015-1261-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, relapsing, and refractory disorder
      of the intestine. Total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) 
      is the preferred and standard surgical procedure for patients' refractory to
      medical therapy. Pouchitis is one of the most common long-term complications
      after IPAA. In the present study, the safety and efficacy of Clostridium
      butyricum MIYAIRI (CBM) as a probiotic were examined. METHODS: A randomized and
      placebo-controlled study was performed. Seventeen patients were recruited from
      2007 to 2013. Nine tablets of MIYA-BM((R)) or placebo were orally administered
      once daily. The cumulative pouchitis-free survival, pouch condition (using the
      modified pouch disease activity index), and blood parameters were evaluated. A
      fecal sample analysis was also performed. RESULTS: Subjects were randomly
      allocated to receive MIYA-BM or placebo (9 and 8 subjects, respectively). One
      subject in the MIYA-BM group and four subjects in the placebo group developed
      pouchitis. No side effects occurred in either group. Characteristic intestinal
      flora was observed in each group. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that probiotic
      therapy with CBM achieved favorable results with minimal side effects and might
      be a useful complementary therapy for the prevention of pouchitis in patients
      with UC who have undergone IPAA.

PG  - 638-43
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0000000000000417 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anemia is a common manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),
      but its prevalence in the United States is not well defined. Aim of this study
      was to determine the prevalence and characteristics of anemia in IBD patients who
      were followed in a US referral center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Demographic,
      clinical, laboratory, and treatment data from a prospective, consented
      longitudinal IBD registry between the years 2009 and 2013 were analyzed. Disease 
      activity was evaluated using Harvey-Bradshaw index in Crohn's disease (CD) and
      ulcerative colitis (UC) activity index in UC as well as C-reactive protein and
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Anemia was defined based on the World Health
      Organization criteria. RESULTS: A total of 1821 IBD patients (1077 with CD, 744
      with UC, median age 43.8 y, 51.9% female) were included. The 5-year period
      prevalence of anemia in IBD patients was 50.1%, (CD: 53.3% vs. UC: 44.7%,
      P=0.001). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, anemia was associated
      with surgery for IBD [odds ratio (OR)=2.77; 95% confidence interval (CI),
      2.21-3.48; P<0.0001], female gender (OR=1.29; 95% CI, 1.04-1.61; P=0.02),
      C-reactive protein (OR=1.26; 95% CI, 1.16-1.37; P<0.0001), erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate (OR=1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.03; P=0.0002), and use of biologics
      (OR=2.00; 95% CI, 1.58-2.52; P=0.0001) or immunomodulators (OR=1.51; 95% CI,
      1.21-1.87; P=0.0003). Iron replacement therapy was administered to 46.8% of the
      anemic patients. CONCLUSION: Anemia has a high period prevalence in IBD patients 
      followed at a tertiary center. Anemia is more common in CD than in UC, is
      associated with disease activity, and in current practice is undertreated.

      the Infection.
PG  - 624-30
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0000000000000427 [doi]
AB  - GOALS: To test whether ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is inhibitory to Clostridium
      difficile and can be used in the treatment of C. difficile-associated ileal
      pouchitis. BACKGROUND: The restoration of secondary bile metabolism may be the
      key mechanism for fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in treating recurrent C.
      difficile infections (RCDI). Therefore, it is possible that exogenous
      administration of inhibitory bile acids may be used directly as nonantibiotic
      therapeutics for this indication. The need for such a treatment alternative is
      especially significant in patients with refractory C. difficile-associated
      pouchitis, where the efficacy of FMT may be limited. STUDY: We measured the
      ability of UDCA to suppress the germination and the vegetative growth of 11
      clinical isolate strains of C. difficile from patients treated with FMT for RCDI.
      In addition, we used oral UDCA to treat a patient with RCDI pouchitis that proved
      refractory to multiple antibiotic treatments and FMT. RESULTS: UDCA was found to 
      be inhibitory to the germination and the vegetative growth of all C. difficile
      strains tested. Fecal concentrations of UDCA from the patient with RCDI pouchitis
      exceeded levels necessary to inhibit the germination and the growth of C.
      difficile in vitro. The patient has remained infection free for over 10 months
      after the initiation of UDCA. CONCLUSIONS: UDCA can be considered as a
      therapeutic option in patients with C. difficile-associated pouchitis. Further
      studies need to be conducted to define the optimal dose and duration of such a
      treatment. In addition, bile acid derivatives inhibitory to C. difficile that are
      able to achieve high intracolonic concentrations may be developed as therapeutics
      for RCDI colitis.
