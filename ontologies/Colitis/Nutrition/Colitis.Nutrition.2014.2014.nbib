TI  - Successful treatment for ulcerative proctitis with rectal tacrolimus in an
      8-year-old girl with intolerance to mesalamine.

AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) is defined as a chronic inflammatory condition causing
      continuous mucosal inflammation of the colon without granulomas on biopsy. It
      affects the rectum, and, to a variable extent, the colon in continuity and is
      characterized by a relapsing and remitting course. Oral 5-aminosalicylic acid
      (5-ASA) regimens are recommended as first-line induction therapy for mild to
      moderately active pediatric UC and for maintenance of remission regardless of
      other initial treatments. In large clinical trials in adults, mesalamine
      intolerance was found in 2-5 % of the patients. We present a case of an
      8-year-old female patient with intolerance to mesalamine and proctitis resistant 
      to conventional therapy who responded to rectal tacrolimus treatment. The patient
      started with a dose of 2 mg/day at night with an excellent response. She reported
      feeling better than any of the previously prescribed treatments and without
      feeling the discomfort of previously administered enemas. After four weeks of
      treatment, the dose was reduced to 2 mg/week with no relapses. Tacrolimus
      suppositories were very well tolerated, and no adverse effects have been
      reported. Although only very little data has been published, rectal tacrolimus
      seems to be safe and of efficacy in ulcerative proctitis resistant to standard
      therapy.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients may be at a higher risk for developing 
      infections due to underlying disease, malnutrition, surgery, or immunosuppressive
      therapy. Therefore, protecting this group against infections is of particular
      importance. Immunisation against vaccine-preventable diseases is strongly
      recommended. This article for the first time summarises data on immunogenicity
      and safety of vaccines in IBD children and provides an update on some important
      issues regarding immunisation in these group of children.

TI  - Focal enhanced gastritis and macrophage microaggregates in the gastric mucosa:
      potential role in the differential diagnosis between Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis.

AB  - CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES: Focally enhanced gastritis and macrophage microaggregates
      are found in the upper gastrointestinal involvement of Crohn's disease, and may
      reflect an underlying defective innate immunity. These features, however, are
      also described in patients with Helicobacter pylori infection. The role of these 
      gastric abnormalities in the diagnosis of Crohn's disease was assessed in a
      population with high prevalence of H. pylori infection. METHODS: Thirty-seven
      Crohn's disease, 26 ulcerative colitis, and 30 control patients were included.
      The H. pylori status was evaluated by the rapid urease test and histology. The
      presence of focally enhanced gastritis and macrophage microaggregates was
      recorded. RESULTS: Focally enhanced gastritis was present in 24% of Crohn's
      disease patients, 4% of ulcerative colitis patients and 11.5% of controls,
      presenting an overall sensitivity and specificity for Crohn's disease of 24% and 
      88%, respectively. Macrophage microaggregates were found in all groups, but were 
      only detected in ulcerative colitis and controls in association with H. pylori
      infection, with an overall sensitivity and specificity for Crohn's disease of 61%
      and 69%, respectively. In the absence of H. pylori infection, focally enhanced
      gastritis and macrophage microaggregates were significantly associated with
      Crohn's disease (P<0.02 and P = 0.001 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Focally
      gastritis and macrophage microaggregates are suggestive of Crohn's disease only
      in H. pylori-negative specimens.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Many Chinese herbs are traditionally used as
      medicine to improve the functions of gastrointestinal tract. Some of these herbs 
      are also promising agents for the improvement of the gut microbiota and the
      treatment of ulcerative colitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: By screening seven
      traditional Chinese herbs, we found that Red Ginseng and Semen Coicis were the
      most effective in promoting the growth of probiotics including Lactobacillus and 
      Bifidobacterium in vitro. We then evaluated the effects of Red Ginseng and Semen 
      Coicis on the growth of the bacterial pathogens (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus
      aureus, and Salmonella spp.) in vitro. In in vivo experiment, we gavage
      administrated trinitro-benzene-sulfonic acid induced ulcerative colitis (UC) rats
      with Red Ginseng and Semen Coicis extracts. After two weeks treatment, we
      analyzed the structure of the gut microbiota and examined the UC symptoms by
      employing qPCR and animal pathology detection techniques. RESULTS: Both Red
      Ginseng and Semen Coicis promoted the growth of probiotics - Bifidobacterium and 
      Lactobacillus in vitro. Red Ginseng also inhibited the growth of some pathogen
      strains. In vivo, Red Ginseng and Semen Coicis improved the structure of gut
      microbiota and relieved the symptoms of ulcerative colitis in vivo. Compared with
      Semen Coicis, Red Ginseng was more effective in relieving the symptoms of
      ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Red Ginseng could promote the growth of
      probiotic bacteria in vitro. Red Ginseng and, to a lesser extent Semen Coicis,
      gave positive results in an experimental in vivo model for ulcerative colitis.

AB  - UNLABELLED: One of the elements of treatment considering inflammatory bowel
      diseases is nutritional therapy. The duration of the above-mentioned depends on
      the prevalence of such symptoms as fever, bowel movements, length of the
      functioning gastrointestinal tract, stoma and intestinal fistula presence.
      Nutritional therapy is an essential element of successful treatment alongside
      pharmacological, surgical, and biological therapy, as well as other methods.
      Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis considered as chronic diseases, lead
      towards physical and biopsychosocial disability, being responsible for the
      reduction in the quality of life. The aim of the study was to determine the
      quality of life after surgical procedures in case of patients diagnosed with
      Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, subjected to natural and parenteral
      nutrition. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group comprised 52 patients from the
      Department of Gastroenterology, Military Medical Institute, and Department of
      Surgery and Clinical Nutrition, Clinical Hospital in Warsaw. The study was
      performed between October, 2011 and April, 2012. The World Health Organization
      Quality of Life Instrument - Bref (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire was used to
      deter-mine the patients' quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: A lower quality of life
      was observed in case of patients subjected to parenteral nutrition, poor
      education, disease symptoms exacerbation, in the majority-rural inhabitants. The 
      quality of life does not depend on gender, type of disease, family status, and
      additional medical care.

AB  - Characterized by colonic mucosa intraepithelial lymphocytosis, lymphocytic
      colitis is primarily an entity presented in the middle-aged to elderly patient
      population. Very few large series of lymphocytic colitis of childhood occurrence 
      are available in the medical literature. Ten cases each of lymphocytic colitis
      and of colonic lymphocytosis of other diagnosis, all with duodenal
      disaccharidases analysis data, were collected from the files of our institution. 
      The electronic medical records were reviewed and multiple variables were
      analyzed. The ten patients with lymphocytic colitis presented with diarrhea. Of
      these, three had abdominal pain. The age range was 2-18 years. Nearly all
      patients were Caucasian (90%) and 70% were female. Endoscopically, most had
      normal appearing colonic mucosa. Significant past medical history, family medical
      history and associated comorbidities included celiac disease, Down syndrome,
      juvenile arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. Interestingly, the most
      revealing observation was that the majority of cases (80%) were associated with
      lactase deficiency and, for the most part, gastrointestinal symptoms improved
      simply by treatment with Lactaid or avoidance of dairy products. This association
      is statistically significant. Our clinicopathological study indicates that the
      typical pediatric patient is a female Caucasian. A large of portion of the
      patients had associated lactase deficiency and improved on Lactaid supplement
      alone.

TI  - Curcumin and inflammatory bowel disease: potential and limits of innovative
      treatments.
PG  - 21127-53
LID - 10.3390/molecules191221127 [doi]
AB  - Curcumin belongs to the family of natural compounds collectively called
      curcuminoids and it possesses remarkable beneficial anti-oxidant,
      anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and neuroprotective properties. Moreover it is
      commonly assumed that curcumin has also been suggested as a remedy for digestive 
      diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), a chronic immune disorder
      affecting the gastrointestinal tract and that can be divided in two major
      subgroups: Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), depending mainly on 
      the intestine tract affected by the inflammatory events. The chronic and
      intermittent nature of IBD imposes, where applicable, long-term treatments
      conducted in most of the cases combining different types of drugs. In more severe
      cases and where there has been no good response to the drugs, a surgery therapy
      is carried out. Currently, IBD-pharmacological treatments are generally not
      curative and often present serious side effects; for this reason, being known the
      relationship between nutrition and IBD, it is worthy of interesting the study and
      the development of new dietary strategy. The curcumin principal mechanism is the 
      suppression of IBD inflammatory compounds (NF-kappaB) modulating immune response.
      This review summarizes literature data of curcumin as anti-inflammatory and
      anti-oxidant in IBD, trying to understand the different effects in CD e UC.

TI  - Response to infliximab therapy in ulcerative colitis is associated with decreased
      monocyte activation, reduced CCL2 expression and downregulation of Tenascin C.
PG  - 56-65
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jju008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The cellular mechanisms leading to infliximab therapy
      response in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) are incompletely known. We
      therefore investigated early effects of infliximab therapy on monocytes and
      associated chemokines linked to clinical therapy response in UC patients.
      METHODS: Blood and biopsies were obtained from anti-TNF therapy-naive UC patients
      (n = 43) before (baseline) and during induction therapy with infliximab. Therapy 
      response was evaluated at Week 14. Expression of monocyte activation markers and 
      levels of chemokines in serum and biopsies were determined. Quantitative
      proteomic analysis was performed in cultured mucosal biopsies, and obtained data 
      was validated in serum. RESULTS: In therapy responders, but not in
      non-responders, infliximab reduced blood monocyte expression of CD14 and CD86, 2 
      weeks after therapy commenced, relative to baseline. Serum CCL2 levels were
      decreased only among therapy responders at Week 2 and Week 14, relative to
      baseline. These data corresponded with lower levels of CD14, CD86 and CCL2 in
      intestinal tissue in responders as compared with non-responders at Week 14.
      Proteomic analysis of cultured biopsies showed that infliximab induced a
      reduction in Tenascin C that predicted downregulation of CCL2. Therapy
      responders, but not non-responders, had decreased serum Tenascin C levels at Week
      2 and Week 14, relative to baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab therapy response in 
      UC patients is associated with reduced monocyte activation and serum levels of
      CCL2 2 weeks after therapy commencement. In therapy responders, infliximab
      influenced Tenascin C, which might be a regulator of CCL2 expression and
      important for induction of the clinical therapy response.

LID - 10.1016/j.cca.2014.12.010 [doi]
LID - S0009-8981(14)00544-0 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We developed a new IgA and IgG anti-MZGP2 antibody ELISAs based on
      recombinant isoform-4 of human zymogen granule protein-2 (GP2), which is the
      major autoantigen of Crohn's disease (CrD)-specific pancreatic autoantibodies and
      assessed their clinical relevance in the largest inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      cohort tested to date. METHODS: 832 sera were studied, including 617 consecutive 
      IBD patients from 323 CrD and 294 ulcerative colitis (UC) follow-up in a tertiary
      centre, and 112 pathological and 103 normal controls. RESULTS: Sensitivity of IgA
      anti-MZGP2 for CrD in the IBD population was 15% and specificity was 98% (95,
      99), while the sensitivity and specificity of IgG anti-MZGP2 were 27% and 97%.
      IgA and IgG anti-MZGP2 combined testing led to a sensitivity of 31% and a
      specificity of 96%. Positivity for either ASCA (IgA or IgG) or anti-MZGP2 (IgA or
      IgG) showed a sensitivity of 75% (70, 80) and a specificity of 84% (79, 89). IgA 
      anti-MZGP2 antibodies were more prevalent in CrD patients with early disease
      onset (p=0.011). Also, anti-MZGP2 positive patients more frequently had extensive
      disease with ileal involvement. Patients with longer disease duration were more
      likely to have IgG anti-MZGP2 antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel ELISA confirms
      the high specificity of anti-MZGP2 antibodies for CrD and their association with 
      disease severity phenotypes.

      altered intestinal microbiota plays a pivotal role in CD pathogenesis. Loss of
      PTPN2 in the T-cell compartment causes enhanced induction of Th1 and Th17 cells, 
      but impaired induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in several mouse colitis
      models, namely acute and chronic dextran sodium sulfate colitis, and T-cell
      transfer colitis models. This results in increased susceptibility to intestinal
      inflammation and intestinal dysbiosis which is comparable with that observed in
      CD patients. We detected inflammatory infiltrates in liver, kidney, and skin and 
      elevated autoantibody levels indicating systemic loss of tolerance in
      PTPN2-deficient animals. CD patients featuring a loss-of-function PTPN2 variant
      exhibit enhanced Th1 and Th17 cell, but reduced Treg markers when compared with
      PTPN2 wild-type patients in serum and intestinal tissue samples. Our data
      demonstrate that dysfunction of PTPN2 results in aberrant T-cell differentiation 
      and intestinal dysbiosis similar to those observed in human CD. Our findings
      indicate a novel and crucial role for PTPN2 in chronic intestinal inflammation.

TI  - Vitamin D as a novel therapy in inflammatory bowel disease: new hope or false
      dawn?
PG  - 5-12
LID - 10.1017/S0029665114001621 [doi]
AB  - There is increasing scientific interest in the field of vitamin D research,
      moving the focus beyond bone health to other disease processes. Low circulating
      vitamin D levels have been reported as a risk factor for several
      pathophysiologically divergent diseases, including cancers, diabetes, CVD,
      multiple sclerosis and inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and 
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). But, therein, remains the challenge: can any
      single nutrient contribute to multiple complex disease mechanisms and,
      ultimately, have therapeutic potential? The aim of this review is to critically
      evaluate several strands of scientific evidence surrounding vitamin D and
      inflammation, primarily focusing on IBD. Epidemiological studies suggest an
      increased incidence of IBD and rheumatoid arthritis in countries of more northern
      latitudes, mirroring sunlight patterns. A considerable body of evidence supports 
      the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D, at least in animal models of IBD.
      Although it is accepted that suboptimal vitamin D status is common in IBD, some
      studies suggest that this associates with more severe disease. With regard to
      treatment, the data are only beginning to emerge from randomised controlled
      trials to suggest that people with IBD may remain in remission longer when
      treated with oral vitamin D. In conclusion, several strands of evidence suggest
      that vitamin D may modify the immune response in IBD. There is a continued need
      for large well-designed clinical trials and mechanistic studies to determine if, 
      and how, this emerging promise translates into tangible clinical benefits for
      people with chronic debilitating diseases such as IBD.

TI  - Differential expression of mucosal trefoil factors and mucins in pediatric
      inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 7343
LID - 10.1038/srep07343 [doi]
AB  - In the intestinal mucosa trefoil factors (TFF) and mucins (Muc) - primarily
      produced by goblet cells - are thought to play a major role in providing barrier 
      function during infection and inflammation. To investigate their role in
      pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) we obtained mucosal
      biopsies of children with CD, UC and healthy controls and analyzed genetic
      expression. Levels of TFF2 mRNA were lower in inflamed mucosal samples (terminal 
      ileum (TI) and duodenum) of children with CD, but higher in non-inflamed mucosal 
      samples when compared to healthy controls (p < 0.05). Similarly, TFF2 levels in
      the TI were significantly lower in inflamed UC tissue. Adjustment for goblet cell
      density revealed slightly less marked, yet significantly different gene
      expression in IBD and controls. Furthermore, TI expression of TFF2 and Muc2 was
      inversely correlated with interleukin-8 expression in CD (p = 0.027). In Summary,
      our data demonstrate significant changes in Muc and TFF mRNA expression in
      pediatric patients with IBD suggesting a role in mucosal healing. Further studies
      are needed to elucidate a potential use as biomarkers for disease progression.

TI  - Temporal trends in inflammatory bowel disease publications over a 19-years
      period.
PG  - 16745-9
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i44.16745 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To determine whether temporal changes occurred in the pediatric vs adult
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), both in terms of number and type of yearly
      published articles. METHODS: We aimed to evaluate all PubMed-registered articles 
      related to the field of IBD from January 1, 1993 and until December 31, 2011. We 
      searched for articles using the key words "inflammatory bowel disease" or
      "Crohn's disease" or "ulcerative colitis" or "undetermined colitis", using the
      age filters of "child" or "adult". We repeated the search according to the total 
      number per year of articles per type of article, for each year of the specified
      period. We studied randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, case reports,
      meta-analyses, letters to the editor, reviews, systematic reviews, practice
      guidelines, and editorials. RESULTS: We identified 44645 articles over the 19
      year-period. There were 8687 pediatric-tagged articles vs 19750 adult-tagged
      articles. Thus 16208 articles were unaccounted and not assigned a "pediatric" or 
      "adult" tag by PubMed. There was an approximately 3-fold significant increase in 
      all articles recorded both in pediatric and adult articles. This significant
      increase was true for nearly every category of article but the number of clinical
      trials, meta-analysis, and randomized controlled trials increased proportionally 
      more than the number of "lower quality" articles such as editorials or letters to
      the editor. Very few guidelines were published every year. CONCLUSION: There is a
      yearly linear increase in publications related to IBD. Relatively, there are more
      and more clinical trials and higher quality articles.

AB  - We performed a prospective study of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases to 
      examine variations in treatment among medical centers. In a prospective cohort
      study of 1659 patients with Crohn's disease and 946 patients with ulcerative
      colitis seen at 7 high-volume referral centers, we collected data on
      demographics, disease characteristics, and medical and surgical treatments. We
      used logistic regression to determine differences in treatment among centers,
      controlling for potential confounders. We found significant variations among
      centers in the treatment of Crohn's disease with immunomodulators (odds ratio
      [OR], 3.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.09-5.32) but not anti-tumor necrosis 
      factor agents (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 0.97-2.77). There was less variation in the
      treatment of ulcerative colitis; we found no difference in use of
      immunomodulators (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.00-3.36) or anti-tumor necrosis factor
      therapy (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.40-1.65). The development and implementation of
      evidence-based standards of care for inflammatory bowel disease may help reduce
      variation and improve outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Incidence rates of microscopic colitis are mainly based on regional
      data from a limited number of countries. To evaluate geographical differences and
      changes over time, more nationwide incidence rates are needed. AIMS: The aim of
      this retrospective study was to assess the incidence rate of microscopic colitis 
      in the Netherlands in a nationwide cohort. METHODS: A search was performed in the
      Dutch pathology registry, covering records of all approximately 16.5 million
      inhabitants. Incident cases were defined as a first diagnosis of microscopic
      colitis (collagenous or lymphocytic colitis) between 2000 and 2012. RESULTS: In
      total, 7228 incident cases were identified with a mean annual incidence rate of
      3.4 per 100,000 person years. Collagenous colitis was present in 3741 cases and
      lymphocytic colitis in 2718 cases, with a mean annual incidence rate of 1.8 and
      1.3 per 100,000 person years, respectively. Remaining 769 cases were described as
      undefined microscopic colitis. Collagenous and lymphocytic colitis incidence
      rates increased significantly over time (p<0.001) with a male:female ratio of 1:3
      and 1:2, respectively. CONCLUSION: The Dutch mean annual incidence rates of
      collagenous and lymphocytic colitis were considerably lower than previously
      reported by other countries. However, incidence rates increased gradually over
      time, with a clear female predominance.

TI  - High- and low-dose oral delayed-release mesalamine in children with
      mild-to-moderately active ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 767-72
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000530 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess the safety and efficacy of high-
      and low-dose oral, delayed-release mesalamine in a randomized, double-blind,
      active control study of children with mild-to-moderately active ulcerative
      colitis. METHODS: Patients ages 5 to 17 years, with a Pediatric Ulcerative
      Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) score of >/= 10 to </= 55 and a truncated Mayo
      Score of >/= 1 for both rectal bleeding and stool frequency, were enrolled. They 
      received body weight-dependent doses of oral, delayed-release mesalamine for 6
      weeks in a low- (27-71 mg . g(-1) . day(-1)) or high-dose group (53-118 mg .
      g(-1) . day(-1)). The primary endpoint was treatment success, defined as the
      proportion of patients who achieved remission (PUCAI score <10) or partial
      response (PUCAI score >/= 10 with a decrease from baseline by >/= 20 points).
      Secondary endpoints included truncated Mayo Score and global assessment of change
      of disease activity. RESULTS: The modified intent-to-treat population included 81
      of 83 patients enrolled. Treatment success by PUCAI was achieved by 23 of 41
      (56%) and 22 of 40 (55%) patients in the mesalamine low- and high-dose groups,
      respectively (P = 0.924). Truncated Mayo Score (low-dose 30 [73%] and high-dose
      28 [70%] patients) and other efficacy results did not differ between the groups. 
      The type and severity of adverse events were consistent with those reported in
      previous studies of adults with ulcerative colitis and did not differ between
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both low- and high-dose oral, delayed-release mesalamine
      doses were equally effective as short-term treatment of mild-to-moderately active
      ulcerative colitis in children, without a specific benefit or risk to using
      either dose.

TI  - Infliximab therapy in pediatric patients 7 years of age and younger.
PG  - 758-62
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000533 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infliximab (IFX) is efficacious for induction and maintenance of
      remission in pediatric patients with moderate-to-severe inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). It has, however, not been studied in patients 7 years old and
      younger. Our aim was to characterize efficacy and safety of IFX therapy in this
      cohort. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of patients with IBD ages 7 years
      and younger, treated with IFX between 1999 and 2011. Medical records were
      reviewed for age of diagnosis, disease phenotype, therapy, surgery, IFX infusion 
      dates, dose, and intervals. Outcome measures included physician global
      assessment, corticosteroid requirement, and adverse events. RESULTS: Thirty-three
      children (ages 2.4-7 years) were included. Twenty patients had Crohn disease, 4
      had ulcerative colitis, and 9 had indeterminate colitis. Maintenance of IFX
      therapy at 1, 2, and 3 years was 36%, 18%, and 12%, respectively. Patients of age
      5 years and younger had the lowest rates of maintenance of therapy at 25% at year
      1, and 10% at years 2 and 3 combined. Nine percent of all of the patients
      demonstrated response measured by the physician global assessment and were
      steroid free at 1 year. There were 8 infusion reactions. There were no
      malignancies, serious infections, or deaths. CONCLUSIONS: IFX demonstrated a
      modest response rate and a low steroid-sparing effect in patients with IBD 7
      years old and younger. Although this is a limited study, there appears to be a
      trend for decreased sustained efficacy with IFX in this age group, particularly
      in children 5 years old and younger, when compared with the previously published 
      literature in older children.

      bowel disease by subjective global assessment.
PG  - 493-507
LID - 10.5152/tjg.2014.4955 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: To investigate the prevalence of malnutrition in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by subjective global assessment (SGA) and the
      effects of oral nutritional support on the clinical parameters, consumption of
      energy, macronutrients and fiber intake in the Study and Control groups,
      prospectively. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 38 (28 Male; 10 Female)
      hospitalized patients with moderate or severe IBD (13 with Crohn's disease (CD); 
      25 with Ulcerative colitis (UC)) were included. At stage 1, the disease severity,
      clinical symptoms and, signs, food consumption and nutritional status by using
      subjective global assessment (SGA) were recorded. At stage 2, the patients were
      blindly randomized into a Study Group and Controls. In the Study Group, a
      standard enteral product was added into the regulated hospital diets, but for the
      Controls, deficits were regulated by only hospital diets for 3 weeks. the
      independent variables were the group, the disease and its activity, age, Body
      body mass index (BMI), weight loss history, the hospitalization period; the
      dependent variables were SGA, bowel movements, change in nutritional status,
      disease severity, clinical findings, and also consumption of macronutrients.
      RESULTS: Prevalance of malnutrition (SGA-B or SGA-C) for all the patients was
      92.1% at the beginning and 71.1% at the end of study. Improvements in disease
      activity score for the patients with UC were statistically significant in both
      the Study Group and the Controls (p=0.006 for the Study Group and p=0.001 for the
      Controls, respectively). Macronutrients, total and water soluble fiber
      consumption levels improved, with statistically significant differences for all
      the groups. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of malnutrition is a major problem in
      patients with IBD. Not only the regulation of hospital food, but also enteral
      nutritional support, improved their levels of malnutrition, as well as their
      energy, macronutrients, and fiber consumption, and SGA is an easy method for
      nutritional monitoring.

TI  - Enteric microbiota leads to new therapeutic strategies for ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 15657-63
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i42.15657 [doi]
AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a leading form of inflammatory bowel disease that
      involves chronic relapsing or progressive inflammation. As a significant
      proportion of UC patients treated with conventional therapies do not achieve
      remission, there is a pressing need for the development of more effective
      therapies. The human gut contains a large, diverse, and dynamic population of
      microorganisms, collectively referred to as the enteric microbiota. There is a
      symbiotic relationship between the human host and the enteric microbiota, which
      provides nutrition, protection against pathogenic organisms, and promotes immune 
      homeostasis. An imbalance of the normal enteric microbiota composition (termed
      dysbiosis) underlies the pathogenesis of UC. A reduction of enteric microbiota
      diversity has been observed in UC patients, mainly affecting the
      butyrate-producing bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, which can
      repress pro-inflammatory cytokines. Many studies have shown that enteric
      microbiota plays an important role in anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory
      activities, which can benefit UC patients. Therefore, manipulation of the
      dysbiosis is an attractive approach for UC therapy. Various therapies targeting a
      restoration of the enteric microbiota have shown efficacy in treating patients
      with active and chronic forms of UC. Such therapies include fecal microbiota
      transplantation, probiotics, prebiotics, antibiotics, helminth therapy, and
      dietary polyphenols, all of which can alter the abundance and composition of the 
      enteric microbiota. Although there have been many large, randomized controlled
      clinical trials assessing these treatments, the effectiveness and safety of these
      bacteria-driven therapies need further evaluation. This review focuses on the
      important role that the enteric microbiota plays in maintaining intestinal
      homeostasis and discusses new therapeutic strategies targeting the enteric
      microbiota for UC.

TI  - Abdominal pain and the neurotrophic system in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 2330-9
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000207 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We undertook a study to test the hypothesis that inflammation alters 
      peripheral sensory mechanisms, thereby contributing to chronic abdominal pain in 
      ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Patients with UC and healthy individuals rated 
      abdominal pain using a visual analog scale and completed surveys describing
      anxiety or depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score) and
      gastrointestinal symptoms (Rome III questionnaire). Patient age, sex, and
      severity of inflammation were determined. Rectal biopsies were processed using
      immunohistochemical techniques to assess nerve fiber density and real-time PCR to
      determine transcript expression of neurotrophins (nerve growth factor, glial
      cell-derived neurotrophic factor, artemin, neurturin), ion channels (transient
      receptor potential vanilloid type 1, transient receptor potential ankyrin 1) and 
      inflammatory mediators (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin [IL]-1beta,
      IL-6, IL-10, IL-17). RESULTS: A total of 77 patients with UC (27 female, 50 male)
      and 21 controls (10 female, 11 male) were enrolled. Patients with UC with pain
      had significantly higher depression scores than controls and patients with UC
      without pain (P < 0.05). There was no correlation between any of the inflammatory
      markers and pain scores. Visual analog scale pain scores significantly correlated
      with younger age, higher depression scores, increased expression of neurturin and
      decreased expression of transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 in the mucosa.
      Mucosal nerve fiber density did not correlate with any measures of inflammation
      or pain. Only higher depression scores independently predicted pain in UC (r >
      0.5). CONCLUSIONS: We did not observe changes in mucosal innervation and did not 
      see a significant relationship between nerve fiber density, inflammatory
      mediators, neurotrophic factors, or mucosal ion channel expression and pain. In
      contrast, the importance of depression as the only independent predictor of pain 
      ratings mirrors functional disorders, where central processes significantly
      contribute to symptom development and/or perpetuation.

TI  - Co-occurrence of celiac disease and ulcerative colitis in a 12-year-old girl.
PG  - 99-102
LID - 10.3109/15513815.2014.970262 [doi]
AB  - Celiac disease (CD) and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are separately
      well-described entities, but the co-occurrence in children has been very rarely
      reported until today. According to the literature, this case about 12-year-old
      girl would be the fifth case ever published about co-occurrence in children. We
      presume that there should be a higher comorbidity prevalence than that described.
      Distinguishing both diseases in one patient could be difficult due to the
      overlapping symptoms, but it is very important considering completely different
      therapeutic approaches.

TI  - S-Adenosylmethionine and methylthioadenosine inhibit beta-catenin signaling by
      multiple mechanisms in liver and colon cancer.
PG  - 77-86
LID - 10.1124/mol.114.095679 [doi]
AB  - S-Adenosylmethionine (SAMe), the principal methyl donor that is available as a
      nutritional supplement, and its metabolite methylthioadenosine (MTA) exert
      chemopreventive properties against liver and colon cancer in experimental models.
      Both agents reduced beta-catenin expression on immunohistochemistry in a murine
      colitis-associated colon cancer model. In this study, we examined the molecular
      mechanisms involved. SAMe or MTA treatment in the colitis-associated cancer model
      lowered total beta-catenin protein levels by 47 and 78%, respectively. In an
      orthotopic liver cancer model, increasing SAMe levels by overexpressing
      methionine adenosyltransferase 1A also reduced total beta-catenin levels by 68%. 
      In both cases, lower cyclin D1 and c-Myc expression correlated with lower
      beta-catenin levels. In liver (HepG2) and colon (SW480, HCT116) cancer cells with
      constitutively active beta-catenin signaling, SAMe and MTA treatment inhibited
      beta-catenin activity by excluding it from the nuclear compartment. However, in
      liver (Huh-7) and colon (RKO) cancer cells expressing wild-type Wnt/beta-catenin,
      SAMe and MTA accelerated beta-catenin degradation by a glycogen synthase kinase
      3-beta-dependent mechanism. Both agents lowered protein kinase B activity, but
      this was not mediated by inhibiting phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Instead, both
      agents increased the activity of protein phosphatase 2A, which inactivates
      protein kinase B. The effect of MTA on lowering beta-catenin is direct and not
      mediated by its conversion to SAMe, as blocking this conversion had no influence.
      In conclusion, SAMe and MTA inhibit Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in colon and liver
      cancer cells regardless of whether this pathway is aberrantly induced, making
      them ideal candidates for chemoprevention and/or chemotherapy in these cancers.

TI  - Gut microbiome and nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases.
PG  - 245-51
LID - 10.1038/pr.2014.157 [doi]
AB  - We review recent findings and hypotheses on the roles of gut microbiome in the
      pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD). Microbial metabolites 
      and cell components contribute to the development of hepatic steatosis and
      inflammation, key components of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the severe
      form of NAFLD. Altered gut microbiome can independently cause obesity, the most
      important risk factor for NAFLD. This capability is attributed to short-chain
      fatty acids (SCFAs), major gut microbial fermentation products. SCFAs account for
      a large portion of caloric intake of the host, and they enhance intestinal
      absorption by activating GLP-2 signaling. However, elevated SCFAs may be an
      adaptive measure to suppress colitis, which could be a higher priority than
      imbalanced calorie intake. The microbiome of NASH patients features an elevated
      capacity for alcohol production. The pathomechanisms for alcoholic
      steatohepatitis may apply to NASH. NAFLD/NASH is associated with elevated
      Gram-negative microbiome and endotoxemia. However, many NASH patients exhibited
      normal serum endotoxin indicating that endotoxemia is not required for the
      pathogenesis of NASH. These observations suggest that microbial intervention may 
      benefit NAFLD/NASH patients. However, very limited effects were observed using
      traditional probiotic species. Novel probiotic therapy based on NAFLD/NASH
      specific microbial composition represents a promising future direction.

PG  - S23-7
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0000000000000253 [doi]
AB  - Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) is a nuclear
      receptor, originally described in adipose tissue, which controls the expression
      of a large number of regulatory genes in lipid metabolism and insulin
      sensitization. Well known by endocrinologists, thiazolidinedionesare classical
      PPARgamma synthetic agonists, which were currently used as insulin-sensitizing
      agents in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Although the clinical benefits of
      thiazolidinediones in treating metabolic disorders have been clearly
      demonstrated, studies performed in animal models of colitis and in patients with 
      ulcerative colitis have also revealed the key roles of PPARgamma activation in
      the regulation of inflammation and immune response, notably in the colon through 
      epithelial cells.

TI  - Treatment with immunosuppressive therapy may improve depressive symptoms in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 465-70

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recent research suggests a relationship of inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) and depression. Our objective was to evaluate for improvement of
      depressive symptoms with treatment of IBD using immunosuppressive medications.
      METHODS: A retrospective study of consecutive patients with IBD started on
      immunosuppressive agents [anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) or
      immunomodulator therapy] was conducted. Patients were evaluated if disease
      activity indices using Harvey Bradshaw Index for Crohn's disease (CD) and Simple 
      Clinical Colitis Disease Activity Index for ulcerative colitis (UC) and
      depressive indices using Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores were
      obtained before and at least 30 days after initiation of therapy. RESULTS:
      Sixteen patients with UC and 53 patients with CD (all with active disease
      symptoms) were evaluated over a 60 day median follow-up evaluation (range 30, 140
      days). Twenty-two patients started on immunomodulator therapy, and 47 patients
      started on anti-TNF therapy. Crohn's disease patients had significantly decreased
      PHQ-9 scores at follow-up [median 9 (range 3, 14) to 4 (1, 8)], with significant 
      decreases only in those started on anti-TNF therapy. Changes in PHQ-9 and CRP
      were correlated (rho = 0.38, p < 0.05). In patients with UC, PHQ-9 scores [5 (3, 
      9) to 2 (0, 5)] were significantly decreased. Percentage at risk of moderate to
      severe depression (PHQ-9 scores >/=10) was lower after treatment [Crohn's disease
      51-18 % (p < 0.05), ulcerative colitis 18-0 %]. CONCLUSION: Depressive scores
      decreased significantly in patients with IBD treated with immunosuppressive
      therapy and the number at risk for moderate to severe depression improved
      significantly.

TI  - Oats and bowel disease: a systematic literature review.
PG  - S31-43
LID - 10.1017/S0007114514002293 [doi]
AB  - Whole-grain foods such as oats may protect against colorectal cancer and have
      benefits on inflammatory bowel disease and coeliac disease. The present study
      aimed to systematically review the literature describing intervention studies
      that investigated the effects of oats or oat bran on risk factors for bowel
      disease. A literature search was conducted using Embase, Medline and the Cochrane
      library, which identified 654 potential articles. Thirty-eight articles
      describing twenty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Two studies carried
      out in participants with a history of colorectal adenomas found no effects of
      increased oat-bran intake on indirect risk makers for colorectal cancer. One of
      two interventions with oat bran in patients with ulcerative colitis showed small 
      improvements in the patients' conditions. Most of the eleven studies carried out 
      in adults with coeliac disease showed no negative effects of uncontaminated oat
      consumption. The fourteen studies carried out in volunteers with no history of
      bowel disease suggest that oats or oat bran can significantly increase stool
      weight and decrease constipation, but there is a lack of evidence to support a
      specific effect of oats on bowel function compared with other cereals. A
      long-term dietary intake of oats or oat bran could benefit inflammatory bowel
      disorders, but this remains to be proven. A protective effect on colorectal
      adenoma and cancer incidence has not yet been convincingly shown. The majority of
      patients with coeliac disease could consume up to 100 g/d of uncontaminated oats,
      which would increase the acceptability of, and adherence to, a gluten-free diet.

TI  - Carbohydrate intake in the etiology of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 2013-21
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000168 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diet may have a role in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease.
      In previous studies, the associations between increased intakes of carbohydrates,
      sugar, starch, and inflammatory bowel disease are inconsistent. However, few
      prospective studies have investigated the associations between these
      macronutrients and incident Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC).
      METHODS: A total of 401,326 men and women were recruited between 1991 and 1998.
      At recruitment, dietary intakes of carbohydrate, sugar, and starch were measured 
      using validated food frequency questionnaires. The cohort was monitored
      identifying participants who developed incident CD or UC. Cases were matched with
      4 controls, and odds ratios were calculated for quintiles of total carbohydrate, 
      sugar, and starch intakes adjusted for total energy intake, body mass index, and 
      smoking. RESULTS: One hundred ten participants developed CD, and 244 participants
      developed UC during follow-up. The adjusted odds ratio for the highest versus the
      lowest quintiles of total carbohydrate intake for CD was 0.87, 95% CI = 0.24 to
      3.12 and for UC 1.46, 95% CI = 0.62 to 3.46, with no significant trends across
      quintiles for either (CD, P trend = 0.70; UC, P trend = 0.41). Similarly, no
      associations were observed with intakes of total sugar (CD, P trend = 0.50; UC, P
      trend = 0.71) or starch (CD, P trend = 0.69; UC, P trend = 0.17). CONCLUSIONS:
      The lack of associations with these nutrients is in agreement with many
      case-control studies that have not identified associations with CD or UC. As
      there is biological plausibility for how specific carbohydrates could have an
      etiological role in inflammatory bowel disease, future epidemiological work
      should assess individual carbohydrates, although there does not seem to be a
      macronutrient effect.

AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease that causes
      gastrointestinal lesions, bleeding, diarrhoea and nutritional complications.
      Insufficient nutrient intake can additionally deteriorate nutritional status. The
      present cross-sectional study aimed to determine whether UC patients adhere to
      national dietary guidelines and to assess their dietary habits. An online
      questionnaire (n 93) was used to assess health-related conditions, current
      nutritional knowledge, professional dietary guidance and food avoidance. A 24 h
      dietary recall (n 81) was used to assess nutrient intakes, which were then
      compared with the national recommended intake values. The results showed that the
      nutritional knowledge of participants was limited with unofficial sources being
      used, including websites. Numerous food groups, predominantly fibre-rich foods
      and fruit and vegetables, were largely avoided by the participants. Almost half
      of the study population eliminated foods such as dairy products to alleviate
      symptoms, possibly unnecessarily. Energy intakes were significantly (P< 0.05)
      lower than the national recommended intake values in women aged 18-65 years and
      men aged 18-60 years. Fat intake exceeded the national recommended intake values 
      (P< 0.0001), at the expense of carbohydrate and fibre intakes, which were
      significantly (P< 0.005) lower than the national recommended intake values.
      Protein intake was significantly high in women aged 19-50 years (P< 0.00) and men
      aged 19-50 years (P< 0.005). Vitamin C, vitamin B12 and Ca intake levels were
      overachieved by all participants (P< 0.001), while women aged 19-50 years did not
      achieve their dietary Fe reference nutrient intake levels (P< 0.001).
      Osteopaenia, osteoporosis and anaemia were reported by 12, 6 and 31 % of the
      participants, respectively. Findings indicate that food avoidance may contribute 
      to nutrient deficiencies in UC patients. Low intakes of these food groups,
      especially during remission, are preventing patients from adhering to dietary
      guidelines.

TI  - Comparing histological activity indexes in UC.
PG  - 1412-8
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2014-307477 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Assessment of disease activity in UC is important for designing an
      optimal therapeutic strategy. No single histology score is considered optimum.
      The aim of this study was to compare intraobserver reproducibility and the
      interobserver agreement of available histological UC activity indexes. METHODS:
      One hundred and two biopsy specimens (collected between 2003 and 2014) were
      scored blindly by three pathologists by determining Geboes, Riley, Gramlich and
      Gupta indexes and global visual evaluation (GVE). Intraobserver reproducibility
      and interobserver agreements for index and items of index were studied by
      intraclass correlation coefficient for quantitative parameter and by kappa values
      and Krippendorff index for qualitative parameters. Relationship between indexes
      was studied by computation of Pearson's and Spearman's correlation coefficients. 
      RESULTS: Geboes, Riley, Gramlich and Gupta indexes and GVE showed good
      intraobserver reproducibility and a good interobserver agreement. Histological
      items that showed the best interobserver agreement were 'erosion/ulceration or
      surface epithelial integrity' and 'acute inflammatory cells
      infiltrate/neutrophils in lamina propria'. The five scores were strongly
      correlated. CONCLUSIONS: Correlation between indexes is strong. Intraobserver
      reproducibility and interobserver agreement for all indexes is very good.
      Histological items that showed the best interobserver agreement are
      'erosion/ulceration' and 'acute inflammatory cells infiltrate/neutrophils in
      lamina propria'.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in pediatric
      patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) and organic
      gastrointestinal (GI) diseases with an age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-matched
      healthy sample across GI diagnostic groups and with one another. STUDY DESIGN:
      The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 Generic Core Scales were completed in
      a 9-site study by 689 families. Patients had 1 of 7 physician-diagnosed GI
      disorders: chronic constipation, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel
      syndrome, functional dyspepsia, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and
      gastroesophageal reflux disease. The healthy control sample included 1114
      families. School days missed, days in bed and needing care, parent missed
      workdays, work impact, and healthcare utilization were compared as well. RESULTS:
      Patients with an FGID or organic GI disease demonstrated lower HRQOL than the
      healthy controls across all dimensions (physical, emotional, social, and school; 
      P < .001 for all), with larger effect sizes for patients with an FGID. Patients
      with an FGID manifested lower HRQOL than those with an organic GI disease.
      Patients with an FGID or organic GI disease missed more school, spent more days
      in bed and needing care, had greater healthcare utilization, and had parents who 
      missed more workdays with greater work impact (P < .001 for most), with larger
      effect sizes for the patients with an FGID. CONCLUSION: Patients with an FGID or 
      organic GI disease demonstrate impaired HRQOL compared with healthy children.
      HRQOL can be used as a common metric to compare patient outcomes in clinical
      research and practice both within and across groups of patients with FGIDs and
      organic GI diseases.

TI  - Intestinal microbiota, probiotics and prebiotics in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 11505-24
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i33.11505 [doi]
AB  - It has been presumed that aberrant immune response to intestinal microorganisms
      in genetically predisposed individuals may play a major role in the pathogenesis 
      of the inflammatory bowel disease, and there is a good deal of evidence
      supporting this hypothesis. Commensal enteric bacteria probably play a central
      role in pathogenesis, providing continuous antigenic stimulation that causes
      chronic intestinal injury. A strong biologic rationale supports the use of
      probiotics and prebiotics for inflammatory bowel disease therapy. Many probiotic 
      strains exhibit anti-inflammatory properties through their effects on different
      immune cells, pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion depression, and the induction
      of anti-inflammatory cytokines. There is very strong evidence supporting the use 
      of multispecies probiotic VSL#3 for the prevention or recurrence of postoperative
      pouchitis in patients. For treatment of active ulcerative colitis, as well as for
      maintenance therapy, the clinical evidence of efficacy is strongest for VSL#3 and
      Escherichia coli Nissle 1917. Moreover, some prebiotics, such as germinated
      barley foodstuff, Psyllium or oligofructose-enriched inulin, might provide some
      benefit in patients with active ulcerative colitis or ulcerative colitis in
      remission. The results of clinical trials in the treatment of active Crohn's
      disease or the maintenance of its remission with probiotics and prebiotics are
      disappointing and do not support their use in this disease. The only exception is
      weak evidence of advantageous use of Saccharomyces boulardii concomitantly with
      medical therapy in maintenance treatment.

TI  - Carnosic acid suppresses colon tumor formation in association with antiadipogenic
      activity.
PG  - 2274-85
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201400293 [doi]
AB  - SCOPE: This study determined the efficacy of carnosic acid (CA) for suppressing
      colon carcinogenesis associated with excess adiposity. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cell 
      growth regulation by CA was evaluated in HT-29 colon adenocarcinoma cells
      cocultured with 3T3-L1 adipocytes. To determine the in vivo efficacies, male A/J 
      mice were divided into four groups and fed one of the following experimental
      diets for 11 wk: 15% fat, 45% fat, 45% fat + 0.01% CA, or 45% fat + 0.02% CA.
      Azoxymethane was administered at the beginning of experimental diet and two
      cycles of dextran sodium sulfate were supplied 1 wk after the azoxymethane
      injection. The proliferation of HT-29 cells cocultured with 3T3-L1 cells was
      significantly higher than proliferation of control cells (p < 0.05). CA treatment
      suppressed the growth of cocultured HT-29 cells through cell cycle arrest and
      enhanced apoptosis by inhibiting leptin receptor (Ob-R) signaling, including Akt 
      and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. CA
      supplementation in vivo decreased the number of colon tumors and reduced
      circulating concentrations of leptin, adiponectin, insulin, and insulin-like
      growth factor 1. Colonic expression of Ob-R, insulin receptor (IR), p-Akt, p-ERK,
      B-cell lymphoma extra large (Bcl-xL), and cyclinD1 protein was also suppressed in
      animals fed CA. CONCLUSION: CA appears to alleviate adipocity-related
      acceleration of colon tumor formation.

TI  - Review article: the management of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis during
      pregnancy and lactation.
PG  - 991-1008
LID - 10.1111/apt.12949 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) commonly affect young patients in
      the reproductive phase of their lives. The chronic and relapsing nature of IBD
      and the potential need for medical or surgical interventions raise concerns about
      family planning issues. AIM: To review the current knowledge on IBD management in
      pregnant and nursing IBD patients. METHODS: A PubMed literature search was
      performed using the search terms 'reproduction' and 'inflammatory bowel disease' 
      and using the headers and main subjects of each section of this article as search
      terms. RESULTS: Male and female fertility are not impaired in the majority of IBD
      patients. In IBD patients with quiescent disease pregnancy outcomes are not
      impaired in comparison to the general population, however, an increased incidence
      of pregnancy complications is observed in active IBD patients. As methotrexate
      (MTX) has been demonstrated to be teratogenic, the use of MTX is contraindicated 
      in patients, who wish to conceive, throughout pregnancy and when nursing.
      However, normal pregnancies following MTX treatment at conception and later have 
      been reported. Most of the other currently approved IBD medications are not
      associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and may be used to maintain quiescent 
      disease or to induce a rapid remission in patients with flares and active
      disease. Breast-feeding in IBD patients is possible and recommended. CONCLUSIONS:
      The overall outcome of pregnancies in IBD patients is favourable and not
      different to healthy controls, thus patients with IBD should not be discouraged
      from having children.

TI  - Somatic development disorders of children with non specific inflammatory bowel
      diseases.
PG  - 323-30
AB  - Frequency of inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis)
      tends to increase in developing countries. Nearly 25% of cases affects pediatric 
      patients. Inflammatory bowel diseases are often associated with weight loss and
      stunting in children. Moreover, weight and height deficiencies are often early
      symptoms. Initially, nonspecific or latent course of disease delays the
      diagnostic process. Malnutrition in inflammatory bowel diseases can be caused by 
      disorders of digestion and nutrients' absorption, intestinal loss, increased
      energy expenditure and appetite impairment. Nutritional deficiencies and
      inflammatory agents lead to disturbance of tissue metabolism - muscle and bone - 
      and retardation of somatic development of affected children. Thus, deficiencies
      of muscle mass, bone mineral density and body height are observed. Insufficient
      normalization of somatic features may be the consequence of recurrent nature of
      disease and specificity of pharmacological treatment. Present work deals with the
      current state of knowledge concerning the somatic development disorders of
      children with inflammatory bowel diseases. Abnormal nutritional status, bone
      mineral density deficits and growth failure of patients have been discussed in
      the context of their relations and dependencies on inflammatory, nutritional and 
      therapeutic factors.

AB  - Chlorogenic acid (CHA) is an antioxidant polyphenol prevalent in human diet, with
      coffee, fruits, and vegetables being its main source. Effects of CHA and CHA
      metabolites were evaluated on the IL-8 production in human intestinal Caco-2
      cells induced by combined stimulation with tumour necrosis factor alpha
      (TNFalpha) and H2O2. CHA and caffeic acid (CA) inhibited TNFalpha- and
      H2O2-induced IL-8 production. We also examined the in vivo effects of CHA and CA 
      using dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. CHA attenuated
      DSS-induced body weight loss, diarrhea, fecal blood, and shortening of colon and 
      dramatically improved colitis histological scores. Furthermore, increases in the 
      mRNA expression of colonic macrophage inflammatory protein 2 and IL-1beta, which 
      were induced by DSS, were significantly suppressed by CHA supplementation. These 
      results suggest that dietary CHA use may aid in the prevention of intestinal
      inflammatory conditions.

TI  - Non-pulmonary allergic diseases and inflammatory bowel disease: a qualitative
      review.
PG  - 11023-32
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i32.11023 [doi]
AB  - While the etiological underpinnings of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are
      highly complex, it has been noted that both clinical and pathophysiological
      similarities exist between IBD and both asthma and non-pulmonary allergic
      phenomena. In this review, several key points on common biomarkers,
      pathophysiology, clinical manifestations and nutritional and probiotic
      interventions for both IBD and non-pulmonary allergic diseases are discussed.
      Histamine and mast cell activity show common behaviors in both IBD and in certain
      allergic disorders. IgE also represents a key immunoglobulin involved in both IBD
      and in certain allergic pathologies, though these links require further study.
      Probiotics remain a critically important intervention for both IBD subtypes as
      well as multiple allergic phenomena. Linked clinical phenomena, especially
      sinonasal disease and IBD, are discussed. In addition, nutritional interventions 
      remain an underutilized and promising therapy for modification of both allergic
      disorders and IBD. Recommending new mothers breastfeed their infants, and
      increasing the duration of breastfeeding may also help prevent both IBD and
      allergic diseases, but requires more investigation. While much remains to be
      discovered, it is clear that non-pulmonary allergic phenomena are connected to
      IBD in a myriad number of ways and that the discovery of common immunological
      pathways may usher in an era of vastly improved treatments for patients.

TI  - The inflammatory bowel disease live interinstitutional and interdisciplinary
      videoconference education (IBD LIVE) series.
PG  - 1687-95
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000187 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Managing patients with inflammatory bowel disease requires
      multidisciplinary coordination. Technological advances have enhanced access to
      care for patients and improved physician interactions. The primary aim of our
      project was to convene diverse institutions and specialties through a multisite
      virtual conferencing platform to discuss complex patient management. METHODS: The
      case conference is designed to include multiple institutions to exchange ideas,
      review evidence-based data, and provide input on the management of patients with 
      Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Technology is supplied and coordinated by
      an information technology specialist and Chorus Call, Inc., an international
      teleconferencing service provider. The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Live
      Interinstitutional Interdisciplinary Videoconference Education (IBD LIVE)
      initiative is accredited by the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC)
      Center for Continuing Education in the Health Sciences for 1 AMA PRA Category 1
      Credit per weekly session. RESULTS: IBD LIVE began in 2009 comprising only adult 
      gastroenterology and pediatric gastroenterology from UPMC Presbyterian and
      Children's Hospitals. Participation steadily increased from 5 sites in 2010 to 11
      sites in 2014. Maximum attendance for a single conference was 73 participants
      with a median of 48. The Continuing Medical Education scores (1 = worst to 5 =
      best) have a high median overall score (4.6, range 3.2-5.0) with positive
      responses with regard to the degree to which the conference changed practice.
      CONCLUSIONS: IBD LIVE has been successful and continues to grow. Implementation
      of the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America Virtual Preceptor Program using 
      the IBD LIVE platform will provide expanded national physician access to this
      professional education activity.

TI  - Changing age demographics of inflammatory bowel disease in Ontario, Canada: a
      population-based cohort study of epidemiology trends.
PG  - 1761-9
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000103 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: International cohort studies have reported increased incidence of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in recent years, and Canada has among the
      highest rates of IBD in the world. This study assessed incidence and prevalence
      of IBD in Ontario, the most populous province of Canada, to determine changing
      trends in age of onset. METHODS: We used a population-based cohort derived from
      validated health administrative data consisting of all Ontario residents living
      with IBD from 1999 to 2008. We determined trends over time using Poisson
      regression analysis, assessing rates in 10-year age groups, children, adults, and
      the elderly. RESULTS: In 2008, 68,071 people were living with IBD among
      12,738,350 people (standardized prevalence 534.3 per 100,000 people). Between
      1999 and 2008, standardized IBD incidence increased from 21.3 to 26.2 per 100,000
      (2.3% per yr, P < 0.0001). Incidence of Crohn's increased from 9.6 to 12.1 per
      100,000 (1.9% per yr, P < 0.0001). Ulcerative colitis incidence increased from
      10.7 to 12.1 per 100,000 (2.0% per yr, P < 0.0001). For IBD, incidence increased 
      significantly in people younger than 10 years of age (9.7% per yr, P < 0.0001),
      10 to 19 years of age (3.8% per yr, P < 0.0001), 30 to 39 years of age (1.8% per 
      yr, P = 0.0006), 40 to 49 years of age (2.8% per yr, P = 0.0001), and 50 to 59
      years of age (2.8% per yr, P < 0.0001). Incidence was stable in patients older
      than 65 years of age at diagnosis (-0.1% per yr, P = 0.73). Although incidence
      did not change significantly over time in adults 20 to 29 years, IBD incidence
      peaked in this age group. CONCLUSIONS: Ontario has among the highest prevalence
      of IBD in the world. Incidence of IBD increased between 1999 and 2008, owing to
      increased incidence in children and adults, with stable rates in elderly people. 
      These findings demonstrate the changing age demographics and growing burden of
      IBD in Ontario, Canada.

AB  - The causes of acute and chronic diarrheal disorders and their underlying
      pathophysiologic mechanisms are common at all ages. The impact of diarrhea,
      however, may be more pronounced in the elderly due to various causes, such as
      age-related structural and functional intestinal changes, concomittant illnesses,
      consume of preventive and therapeutic drugs, impaired sense of hunger and thirst,
      compromised nutrition and hydration to withstand the effect of diarrhea, more
      frequent hospital admissions and courses of antibiotics, and more subtle clinical
      presentation than in younger patients. These aspects have to be considered when
      investigating and treating diarrhea of older patients. Diarrhea may have a
      devastating effect on quality of life in the elderly and above all, fecal
      incontinence is a common consequence. In elderly institutionalized persons, fecal
      impaction in the rectum with liquid stool leaking around the hard, dry fecal mass
      is often associated with fecal incontinence. In this article, general aspects of 
      diarrhea in the elderly, clostridium difficile infection, ischemic colitis,
      microscopic colitis and incontinence due to fecal impaction are discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Few studies have specifically examined models of care in
      IBD. This survey was designed to help gather information from health
      professionals working in IBD services on current care models, and their views on 
      how to best reshape existing models for IBD care worldwide. METHODS: An online
      mixed-methods survey was conducted with health professionals caring for IBD
      patients. Recruitment was conducted using the snowballing technique, where
      members of professional networks of the investigators were invited to
      participate. Results of the survey were summarised using descriptive statistics. 
      RESULTS: Of the 135 included respondents, 76 (56%) were female, with a median age
      of 44 (range: 23-69) years, 50% were GI physicians, 34% nurses, 8% psychologists,
      4% dieticians, 2% surgeons, 1% psychiatrists, and 1% physiotherapists. Overall,
      73 (54%) respondents considered their IBD service to apply the integrated model
      of care, and only 5% reported that they worked exclusively using the biomedical
      care (no recognition of psychosocial factors). The majority of respondents
      reported including mental health assessment in their standard IBD care (65%), 51%
      believed that an ideal IBD service should be managed in specialist led clinics,
      and 64% wanted the service to be publicly funded. Respondents pictured an ideal
      IBD service as easy-access fully multi-disciplinary, with a significant role for 
      IBD nurses and routine psychological and nutritional assessment and care.
      CONCLUSIONS: Health care professionals believe that an ideal IBD service should: 
      be fully integrated, involve significant roles of nurses, psychologists and
      dieticians, run in specialist clinics, be easily accessible to patients and
      publicly funded.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Remarkable differences in quality of care (QoC) might be observed
      in different countries, affecting quality of life of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) patients. The aim of this study was to assess patient and physician
      perceptions of the QoC in Italy. METHODS: A multicentre observational study on
      the quality of care in IBD (SOLUTION-1) was conducted in 36 IG-IBD (Italian Group
      for Inflammatory Bowel Disease) centres in Italy. The QUOTE-IBD (Quality of Care 
      Through the Patient's Eyes) questionnaire was administered to IBD patients and to
      the attending physicians. The Quality Impact (QI) score summarises the QUOTE-IBD 
      questionnaire, and a QI >9 is considered satisfactory. RESULTS:
      Nine-hundred-ninety-two patients and 75 physicians completed the QUOTE-IBD
      questionnaire. The patients scored the domains of competence (9.47 vs. 8.55) and 
      costs (9.54 vs. 8.26) higher that the physicians, while information (9.31 vs.
      9.43) and continuity of care (8.40 vs. 9.01) were scored lower. The QI score was 
      rated worse by physicians with less experience (<12 years) with regard to
      competence (8.0 vs. 9.01), courtesy (8.12 vs. 10.0) and autonomy (8.97 vs. 10.0).
      Physicians considered the cost domain unsatisfactory. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare was
      rated as satisfactory overall for Italian patients and physicians. The physicians
      underestimate their competence and consider the cost of medical management
      unsatisfactory. The patients are more critical regarding the continuity of care
      and information. Country-specific data on QoC allow local governments to allocate
      resources more effectively.

TI  - Changes of activity and isoforms of alkaline sphingomyelinase (nucleotide
      pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase 7) in bile from patients undergoing endoscopic 
      retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
PG  - 138
LID - 10.1186/1471-230X-14-138 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alkaline sphingomyelinase (NPP7) is an ecto-enzyme expressed in
      intestinal mucosa, which hydrolyses sphingomyelin (SM) to ceramide and
      inactivates platelet activating factor. It is also expressed in human liver and
      released in the bile. The enzyme may have anti-tumour and anti-inflammatory
      effects in colon and its levels are decreased in patients with colon cancer and
      ulcerative colitis. Active NPP7 is translated from a transcript of 1.4 kb,
      whereas an inactive form from a 1.2 kb mRNA was found in colon and liver cancer
      cell lines. While the roles of NPP7 in colon cancer have been intensively
      studied, less is known about the function and implications of NPP7 in the bile.
      The present study examines the changes of NPP7 in bile of patients with various
      hepatobiliary diseases. METHODS: Bile samples were obtained at endoscopic
      retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in 59 patients with gallstone, other
      benign disease, tumour, and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). The NPP7
      activity was determined. The appearance of the 1.4 and 1.2 kb products in the
      bile was examined by Western blot. The results were correlated to the diseases
      and also plasma bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. RESULTS: NPP7 activity in the
      tumour group was significantly lower than in the gallstone group (p < 0.05). The 
      activity in the tumour plus PSC group was also lower than in gallstone plus other
      benign disease group (p < 0.05). Within the tumour group NPP7 activity was lowest
      in cholangiocarcinoma patients, being only 19% of that in gallstone patients.
      Bilirubin correlated inversely to NPP7 and was higher in the tumour than in the
      gallstone group. Western blot identified both the 1.4 kb and the 1.2 kb products 
      in most bile samples. The density ratio for the 1.4/1.2 kb products correlated to
      NPP7 activity significantly. Two patients (one PSC and one cholangiocarcinoma)
      lacking NPP7 activity had only the 1.2 kb form in bile. CONCLUSION: NPP7 activity
      and the ratio of 1.4/1.2 kb products in bile are significantly decreased in
      malignancy, particularly in cholangiocarcinoma. The implications of the finding
      in diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma and 1.2 kb product in hepatobiliary diseases
      require further investigation.

TI  - Managing ambulatory ulcerative colitis patients with infliximab: a long term
      follow-up study in primary gastroenterology centers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Infliximab (IFX) is the key treatment for ulcerative colitis (UC)
      unresponsive to standard treatments. The aim of the present study was to assess
      the efficacy and safety of IFX in treating ambulatory UC patients in primary
      gastroenterology centers. METHODS: One hundred and eighteen patients (65 M, 63 F,
      median age 34 years, range 19-71 years), affected by UC, were treated with IFX.
      Clinical efficacy, safety, mucosal healing (MH), and histological healing (HH)
      were assessed at a scheduled follow-up of 42 months. RESULTS: Percentage of
      patients with clinical remission persistence at 42-month follow-up was 70.4%.
      Colectomy occurred in only 3 patients (2.7%). At 42-month follow-up percentage of
      patients with MH was 44.6%, and percentage of patients with HH was 24.3%. HH at
      6-month follow-up occurred in 13 out of 34 patients (38.2%) with C-reactive
      protein (CRP) <3 and in 8 out of 76 patients (10.5%) with CRP >/= 3 (p=0.002).
      Side effects were reported in 16 patients (13.6%): infusion reactions occurred in
      7 patients, other severe side-effects occurred in 3 patients, and opportunistic
      infections occurred in 3 patients (2.5%). Finally, 3 cancers (2.5%) occurred
      during the follow-up period (1 breast, 1 kidney and 1 rectal cancer). Both
      univariate and multivariate analyses showed Hb <11.5 g/dL and HH at 6-month
      follow-up to be significantly associated with treatment failure during follow-up.
      CONCLUSIONS: IFX seems to be effective and safe in long-term treatment of
      outpatients affected by UC.

TI  - Calorie intake of enteral nutrition and clinical outcomes in acutely critically
      ill patients: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
PG  - 291-300
LID - 10.1177/0148607114544322 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The appropriate calorie intake to be provided to critically ill
      patients via enteral nutrition (EN) remains unclear. We performed a meta-analysis
      of randomized controlled trials to compare the effect of initial underfeeding and
      full feeding in acutely critically ill patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We
      searched the Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 
      databases to identify randomized controlled trials that compared underfeeding
      with full feeding in critically ill patients. The primary outcome was overall
      mortality. The secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay, length of
      intensive care unit (ICU) stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, incidence of 
      pneumonia, Clostridium difficile colitis, other infectious complications, and
      gastrointestinal intolerance. RESULTS: In total, 4 studies were included in this 
      meta-analysis. There was no significant difference in overall mortality between
      the underfeeding and full-feeding groups (odds ratio [OR], 0.94; 95% confidence
      interval [CI], 0.74-1.19; I (2) = 26.6%; P = .61). Subgroup analysis of the
      underfeeding subgroup that was fed >/=33.3% of the standard caloric requirement
      indicated that overall mortality was significantly lower in this underfeeding
      subgroup than in the full-feeding group (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.40-1.00; I (2) = 0%;
      P = .05). In contrast, no difference in overall mortality was noted between the
      underfeeding subgroup that was fed <33.3% of the standard caloric requirement and
      the full-feeding group. The length of hospital stay and length of ICU stay did
      not differ between the 2 groups. Moreover, no differences in other secondary
      clinical outcomes were noted. CONCLUSIONS: None of the analyzed clinical outcomes
      for the acutely critically ill patients were significantly influenced by the
      calorie intake of the initial EN.

TI  - Smoking cessation alters intestinal microbiota: insights from quantitative
      investigations on human fecal samples using FISH.
PG  - 1496-501
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000129 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There has been a dramatic increase in investigations on the potential
      mechanistic role of the intestinal microbiota in various diseases and factors
      modulating intestinal microbial composition. We recently reported on intestinal
      microbial shifts after smoking cessation in humans. In this study, we aimed to
      conduct further microbial analyses and verify our previous results obtained by
      pyrosequencing using a direct quantitative microbial approach. METHODS: Stool
      samples of healthy smoking human subjects undergoing controlled smoking cessation
      during a 9-week observational period were analyzed and compared with 2 control
      groups, ongoing smoking and nonsmoking subjects. Fluorescence in situ
      hybridization was applied to quantify specific bacterial groups. RESULTS:
      Intestinal microbiota composition was substantially altered after smoking
      cessation as characterized by an increase in key representatives from the phyla
      of Firmicutes (Clostridium coccoides, Eubacterium rectale, and Clostridium leptum
      subgroup) and Actinobacteria (HGC bacteria and Bifidobacteria) as well as a
      decrease in Bacteroidetes (Prevotella spp. and Bacteroides spp.) and
      Proteobacteria (beta- and gamma-subgroup of Proteobacteria). CONCLUSIONS: As
      determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization, an independent direct
      quantitative microbial approach, we could confirm that intestinal microbiota
      composition in humans is influenced by smoking. The characteristics of observed
      microbial shifts suggest a potential mechanistic association to alterations in
      body weight subsequent to smoking cessation. More importantly, regarding
      previously described microbial hallmarks of dysbiosis in inflammatory bowel
      diseases, a variety of observed microbial alterations after smoking cessation
      deserve further consideration in view of the divergent effect of smoking on the
      clinical course of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Levels of drug and antidrug antibodies are associated with outcome of
      interventions after loss of response to infliximab or adalimumab.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: There is controversy about whether levels of anti-tumor
      necrosis factor (TNF) and antidrug antibodies (ADAs) are accurate determinants of
      loss of response to therapy. We analyzed the association between trough levels of
      anti-TNF agents or ADAs and outcomes of interventions for patients with loss of
      response to infliximab or adalimumab. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study
      of pediatric and adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease and suspected
      loss of response to anti-TNF agents treated at medical centers throughout Israel 
      from October 2009 through February 2013. We examined the correlation between
      outcomes of different interventions and trough levels of drug or ADAs during loss
      of response. An additional subanalysis was performed including only patients with
      a definite inflammatory loss of response (clinical worsening associated with
      increased levels of C-reactive protein or fecal calprotectin, or detection of
      inflammation by endoscopy, fistula discharge, or imaging studies). RESULTS: Among
      247 patients (42 with ulcerative colitis), there were 330 loss-of-response events
      (188 to infliximab and 142 to adalimumab). Trough levels of adalimumab greater
      than 4.5 mcg/mL and infliximab greater than 3.8 mcg/mL identified patients who
      failed to respond to an increase in drug dosage or a switch to another anti-TNF
      agent with 90% specificity; these were set as adequate trough levels. Adequate
      trough levels identified patients who responded to expectant management or
      out-of-class interventions with more than 75% specificity. Levels of antibodies
      against adalimumab >4 microgram per mL equivalent (mcg/mL-eq) or antibodies
      against infliximab >9 mcg/mL-eq identified patients who did not respond to an
      increased drug dosage with 90% specificity. Patients with high titers of ADAs had
      longer durations of response when anti-TNF agents were switched than when dosage 
      was increased (P = .03; log-rank test), although dosage increases were more
      effective for patients with no or low titers of ADAs (P = .02). An analysis of
      definite inflammatory loss-of-response events (n = 244) produced similar results;
      patients with adequate trough levels had a longer duration of response when they 
      switched to a different class of agent than when anti-TNF was optimized by either
      a dosage increase or by a switch within the anti-TNF class (P = .002; log-rank
      test). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this retrospective analysis suggest that
      trough levels of drug or ADAs may guide therapeutic decisions for more than
      two-thirds of inflammatory bowel disease patients with either clinically
      suspected or definite inflammatory loss of response to therapy.

AB  - Patients with a diverse spectrum of rare genetic disorders can present with
      inflammatory bowel disease (monogenic IBD). Patients with these disorders often
      develop symptoms during infancy or early childhood, along with endoscopic or
      histological features of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or IBD
      unclassified. Defects in interleukin-10 signaling have a Mendelian inheritance
      pattern with complete penetrance of intestinal inflammation. Several genetic
      defects that disturb intestinal epithelial barrier function or affect innate and 
      adaptive immune function have incomplete penetrance of the IBD-like phenotype.
      Several of these monogenic conditions do not respond to conventional therapy and 
      are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Due to the broad spectrum of
      these extremely rare diseases, a correct diagnosis is frequently a challenge and 
      often delayed. In many cases, these diseases cannot be categorized based on
      standard histological and immunologic features of IBD. Genetic analysis is
      required to identify the cause of the disorder and offer the patient appropriate 
      treatment options, which include medical therapy, surgery, or allogeneic
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In addition, diagnosis based on genetic 
      analysis can lead to genetic counseling for family members of patients. We
      describe key intestinal, extraintestinal, and laboratory features of 50 genetic
      variants associated with IBD-like intestinal inflammation. In addition, we
      provide approaches for identifying patients likely to have these disorders. We
      also discuss classic approaches to identify these variants in patients, starting 
      with phenotypic and functional assessments that lead to analysis of candidate
      genes. As a complementary approach, we discuss parallel genetic screening using
      next-generation sequencing followed by functional confirmation of genetic
      defects.

TI  - Intestinal steroidogenesis controls PPARgamma expression in the colon and is
      impaired during ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 901-10
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2014-307618 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Immune tolerance breakdown during UC involves the peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma), a key factor in mucosal
      homoeostasis and the therapeutic target of 5-aminosalycilates, which expression
      is impaired during UC. Here we assess the impact of glucocorticoids (GCs) on
      PPARgamma expression, focusing especially on extra-adrenal cortisol production by
      colonic epithelial cells (CECs). METHODS: Activation of PPARgamma in the colon
      was evaluated using transgenic mice for the luciferase gene under PPAR control
      (peroxisome proliferator response element-luciferase mice). Protein and mRNA
      expression of PPARgamma were evaluated with colon fragments and purified CEC from
      mice. Cortisol production and steroidogenic factor expression were quantified in 
      human CEC of patients with UC and those of controls. Gene expression knockdown by
      short hairpin RNA in Caco-2 cells was used for functional studies. RESULTS: GCs
      were able to raise luciferase activity in peroxisome proliferator response
      element-luciferase mice. In the mice colons and Caco-2 cells, PPARgamma
      expression was increased either with GCs or with an inducer of steroidogenesis
      and then decreased after treatment with a steroidogenesis inhibitor. Cortisol
      production and steroidogenic factor expression, such as liver receptor
      homologue-1 (LRH-1), were decreased in CEC isolated from patients with UC,
      directly correlating with PPARgamma impairment. Experiments on Caco-2 cells
      lacking LRH-1 expression confirmed that LRH-1 controls PPARgamma expression by
      regulating GC synthesis in CEC. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate cortisol
      control of PPARgamma expression in CEC, highlighting cortisol production
      deficiency in colonocytes as a key molecular event in the pathophysiology of UC.

PG  - 266-70
LID - 10.1111/jpc.12685 [doi]
AB  - Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), the two main types of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), have become increasingly common in Australasian
      children and adolescents in recent years. Furthermore, CD and UC are seen more
      often in younger children. These conditions are typically more extensive in
      children and tend to follow more severe disease courses than in adults. Although 
      many children may present with typical symptoms (such as abdominal pain or bloody
      diarrhoea), others have atypical features (including oral ulceration, short
      stature or skin manifestations). In addition, many children with IBD will have
      altered growth or nutrition, which may compromise normal linear growth and
      pubertal development. Early identification and full assessment of children
      presenting with possible IBD are essential to avoid consequences of diagnostic
      delay and to optimise short- and long-term outcomes. Management of IBD
      encompasses various options and should be undertaken within a team-based, child
      and family-focused, multidisciplinary setting.

TI  - Targeting mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species to reduce epithelial
      barrier dysfunction and colitis.

AB  - Epithelial permeability is often increased in inflammatory bowel diseases. We
      hypothesized that perturbed mitochondrial function would cause barrier
      dysfunction and hence epithelial mitochondria could be targeted to treat
      intestinal inflammation. Mitochondrial dysfunction was induced in human
      colon-derived epithelial cell lines or colonic biopsy specimens using
      dinitrophenol, and barrier function was assessed by transepithelial flux of
      Escherichia coli with or without mitochondria-targeted antioxidant (MTA)
      cotreatment. The impact of mitochondria-targeted antioxidants on gut permeability
      and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in mice was tested.
      Mitochondrial superoxide evoked by dinitrophenol elicited significant
      internalization and translocation of E. coli across epithelia and control colonic
      biopsy specimens, which was more striking in Crohn's disease biopsy specimens;
      the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, MitoTEMPO, inhibited these barrier
      defects. Increased gut permeability and reduced epithelial mitochondrial
      voltage-dependent anion channel expression were observed 3 days after DSS. These 
      changes and the severity of DSS-colitis were reduced by MitoTEMPO treatment. In
      vitro DSS-stimulated IL-8 production by epithelia was reduced by MitoTEMPO.
      Metabolic stress evokes significant penetration of commensal bacteria across the 
      epithelium, which is mediated by mitochondria-derived superoxide acting as a
      signaling, not a cytotoxic, molecule. MitoTEMPO inhibited this barrier
      dysfunction and suppressed colitis in DSS-colitis, likely via enhancing barrier
      function and inhibiting proinflammatory cytokine production. These novel findings
      support consideration of MTAs in the maintenance of epithelial barrier function
      and the management of inflammatory bowel diseases.

AB  - Cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis is uncommon in young infants. Here we report a case
      of a 10-week-old breastfed infant admitted to the emergency room for rectal
      bleeding. He had had stools streaked with red blood for four days, was in good
      general condition, and was apyretic. Blood count, C-reactive protein, stool
      bacteriology and virology, abdominal X-ray examination, and abdominal ultrasounds
      did not reveal any abnormality. Cow's milk protein allergy was suggested despite 
      the negativity of specific immunoglobulins E (IgE) and a diet excluding cow's
      milk protein was initiated in the mother. In a context of persistent rectal
      bleeding and good general condition, an endoscopic examination found diffuse
      hemorrhagic colitis and an erythematous aspect of the fundus. CMV was revealed by
      histological examination (typical cytopathic effect and immunostaining) and high 
      viral load in the blood. The patient's immune balance was normal and the mother
      did not have any form of CMV infection. The diagnosis of primary CMV infection
      was retained in this immunocompetent child. Rectal bleeding disappeared without
      specific antiviral treatment. This observation points out that with rectal
      bleeding in an infant, cow's milk protein allergy should not be the only cause
      considered.

PG  - 1690-3
LID - 7500 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Acute severe exacerbations of Ulcerative Colitis (UC) represent a
      medical emergency in children and adults. Intravenous steroids remain the first
      line therapy for this condition, although the steroid refractoriness is common.
      Second-line therapy, based on the infliximab or thiopurines should be started if 
      no response to corticosteroids is noted. The use of infliximab in children with
      acute severe UC, nevertheless, does not avoid the colectomy in all cases.
      METHODS: We present a case of severe acute UC in a paediatric patient
      successfully treated with thalidomide following the failed treatment with
      infliximab and a review of the literature. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first case of
      a patient presenting with acute severe UC who was treated with thalidomide, with 
      favorable evolution. In our case the use of this drug was able to avoid the
      colectomy that represent the conventional but very invasive recommended
      therapeutic option of this condition. Therefore, thalidomide may be considered as
      rescue therapy in selected and carefully monitored cases of acute severe CU.

TI  - Association of levels of antibodies from patients with inflammatory bowel disease
      with extracellular proteins of food and probiotic bacteria.
PG  - 351204
LID - 10.1155/2014/351204 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an autoimmune disease characterized by a
      chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract mucosa and is related to an
      abnormal immune response to commensal bacteria. Our aim of the present work has
      been to explore the levels of antibodies (IgG and IgA) raised against
      extracellular proteins produced by LAB and its association with IBD. We analyzed,
      by Western-blot and ELISA, the presence of serum antibodies (IgA and IgG)
      developed against extracellular protein fractions produced by different food
      bacteria from the genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. We used a sera
      collection consisting of healthy individuals (HC, n = 50), Crohn's disease
      patients (CD, n = 37), and ulcerative colitis patients (UC, n = 15). Levels of
      IgA antibodies developed against a cell-wall hydrolase from Lactobacillus casei
      subsp. rhamnosus GG (CWH) were significantly higher in the IBD group (P < 0.002; 
      n = 52). The specificity of our measurements was confirmed by measuring IgA
      antibodies developed against the CWH peptide 365-VNTSNQTAAVSAS-377. IBD patients 
      appeared to have different immune response to food bacteria. This paper sets the 
      basis for developing systems for early detection of IBD, based on the association
      of high levels of antibodies developed against extracellular proteins from food
      and probiotic bacteria.

      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1568-74
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000114 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mesenteric fat plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's
      disease (CD), and a higher ratio of visceral fat area (VFA) to subcutaneous fat
      area (SFA) is related to complicated disease status. Exclusive enteral nutrition 
      (EEN) is an effective treatment option for patients with CD, and the aims of this
      study were to assess the effects of EEN on abdominal fat in patients with CD.
      METHODS: Patient data were obtained from a prospectively maintained database. The
      SFA and VFA were measured in 38 patients with CD before and after 8-week EEN
      therapy, and the mesenteric fat index (MFI), defined as the ratio of VFA to SFA, 
      was calculated. The correlations between MFI and CD activity index and C-reactive
      protein level were also evaluated. RESULTS: The median age of the patients in our
      study was 29 years, and the median duration of disease was 3.05 years. Both VFA
      (P = 0.029) and MFI (P = 0.021) were significantly decreased in patients after
      EEN, but no significant change was observed in SFA (P = 0.335). MFI was
      significantly correlated with CD activity index (r = 0.523, P = 0.001) and
      C-reactive protein (r = 0.634, P < 0.0001) in patients with active CD before EEN,
      although no positive correlations were observed in patients after EEN treatment. 
      CONCLUSIONS: EEN induction therapy was associated with a significant decrease in 
      VFA in patients with CD, and MFI was significantly correlated with CD activity
      index and C-reactive protein in active CD. Thus, our data reveal additional
      beneficial therapeutic mechanisms of enteral nutrition treatment in CD.

      similarities and differences.
PG  - 716579
LID - 10.1155/2014/716579 [doi]
AB  - Due to the intestinal inflammation, tissue damage, and painful abdominal symptoms
      restricting dietary intake associated with both diseases, patients with
      intestinal pelvic radiation disease (PRD) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are
      at increased risk to develop protein calorie malnutrition and micronutrient
      deficiencies. In the current paper, we review the nutritional management of both 
      diseases, listing the similar approaches of nutritional management and the
      nutritional implications of intestinal dysfunction of both diseases. Malnutrition
      is prevalent in patients with either disease and nutritional risk screening and
      assessment of nutritional status are required for designing the proper
      nutritional intervention plan. This plan may include dietary management, oral
      nutritional supplementation, and enteral and/or parenteral nutrition. In addition
      to managing malnutrition, nutrients exert immune modulating effects during
      periods of intestinal inflammation and can play a role in mitigating the risks
      associated with the disease activity. Consistently, exclusive enteral feeding is 
      recommended for inducing remission in pediatric patients with active Crohn's
      disease, with less clear guidelines on use in patients with ulcerative colitis.
      The field of immune modulating nutrition is an evolving science that takes into
      consideration the specific mechanism of action of nutrients, nutrient-nutrient
      interaction, and preexisting nutritional status of the patients.

AB  - We sought to determine whether extremely-early-onset childhood inflammatory bowel
      disease (age <6 years; 20 ulcerative colitis [UC], 8 Crohn disease [CD], 2
      indeterminate, sequentially diagnosed) was clinically more severe than in older
      children (6-17 years; 19 UC, 39 CD, 2 indeterminate). Early-onset UC was marked
      by less abdominal pain at presentation, but an aggressive course with a
      significant reduction in weight-for-age, increased use of immunosuppressants, and
      more surgery. Children with early-onset CD were more likely to have bloody stools
      at presentation and an isolated colitis. This study supports the suggestion that 
      inflammatory bowel disease phenotype differs in early-onset disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There are reports on mesalamine-induced bloody diarrhea mimicking
      ulcerative colitis (UC) relapse, mostly in adults. METHODS: Herein we present a
      case of a child with UC who developed relapse of hemorrhagic colitis related to
      mesalamine. RESULTS: A 10-year-old girl developed severe symptoms mimicking UC
      relapse 3 weeks after introduction of mesalamine therapy. After mesalamine was
      withdrawn, her symptoms improved, but deteriorated again during the challenge of 
      mesalamine despite concomitant use of corticosteroids. CONCLUSION: This is the
      first case report on such a young child during the concomitant use of
      corticosteroids.

TI  - Relapsing and refractory ulcerative colitis in children.
PG  - 419-26
LID - 10.1159/000358148 [doi]
AB  - Approximately half of the children with ulcerative colitis (UC) have refractory, 
      relapsing or steroid-dependent disease. UC in children is more extensive than in 
      adults, presents more often with severe attacks and carries a more aggressive
      disease course. Therefore, although a step-up approach is usually recommended in 
      UC, aggressive therapy will often be indicated in children since steroid
      dependency should never be tolerated. It is vital to ensure that in every
      resistant case, the symptoms are truly related to the inflammatory disease
      activity and not to other conditions such as poor adherence to treatment,
      infections, adverse reactions to drugs, irritable bowel syndrome, lactose
      intolerance, celiac disease and bacterial overgrowth. The clinician should be
      ready to escalate therapy in a timely manner but only after ensuring optimization
      of current treatments. Optimization may include, among others, appropriate
      dosage, utilization of assays that determine thiopurine, calcineurin inhibitors
      and anti-tumor necrosis factor levels, introduction of combination therapy when
      indicated (enemas and immunomodulators) and a long enough time for treatment to
      become effective. Colectomy is always a valid option and should be discussed
      before major treatment escalations. Experimental therapies can be considered when
      all else fails and the family prefers to avoid colectomy. The management of
      refractory and relapsing disease is particularly challenging in children, and
      this review summarizes the available evidence to guide treatment decisions in
      this setup.

TI  - Are we using and monitoring thiopurines and biologics optimally?
PG  - 410-8
LID - 10.1159/000358147 [doi]
AB  - The use of biologics and thiopurines in patients with inflammatory bowel disease 
      has increased rapidly over the last 2 decades with both classes of drugs being
      used more frequently and earlier in the disease course. This vogue has come about
      through a realisation that for some patients Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis are progressive diseases and that use of these therapies can sometimes
      prevent that progression. However, knowledge about the optimal way in which to
      use these drugs continues to evolve. In this paper, the evidence regarding
      optimal timing and dosing of thiopurines and biologics will be reviewed as will
      the role of thiopurine methyltransferase testing along with therapeutic drug
      monitoring of both thiopurines and biologics. In addition, possible future
      applications of biologic drug level and anti-drug antibody testing will be
      considered.

TI  - Standardized recording of parameters related to the natural history of
      inflammatory bowel disease: from Montreal to Paris.
PG  - 337-44
LID - 10.1159/000358133 [doi]
AB  - Similar to adults, there is heterogeneous phenotypic expression of inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) in children. Thus, a classification system for disease
      characteristics is obligatory if one seeks to understand and eventually change
      the natural history of IBD. Extrapolation of adult clinical trial results to
      children also depends upon comparable classifications of disease. Features that
      can differentiate IBD in children from adults include more extensive and severe
      disease at presentation, frequent corticosteroid dependency, change in location
      and behavior over time, and the implications of disease for growth and sexual
      maturation. In contrast to the Montreal classification where all patients <17
      years were grouped together, the Paris classification recognizes the different
      expression of pediatric IBD between those patients aged <10 years and those 10-17
      years of age. The recent identification of monogenic disorders in very young
      children (<2 years) with severe IBD-like disease has further clouded the issue of
      where appropriate pediatric age guidelines should be drawn, though it is clear
      these infantile-onset cases should not be grouped with older children. The Paris 
      classification recognizes the importance of upper tract disease on natural
      history by dividing it into L4a and L4b (proximal and distal to the ligament of
      Treitz, respectively), while the Montreal system groups all upper-tract patients 
      together. Complicated disease behavior in the Montreal system mandated a single
      category preventing the concomitant designation as stricturing and penetrating,
      whereas the Paris classification recognizes that both stricturing and penetrating
      behavior may occur at the same or different times. Growth delay is recognized
      only in the Paris classification as a serious manifestation of IBD in children
      affecting therapeutic decisions. As our understanding of the basic molecular
      mechanisms of disease pathogenesis in IBD changes over time, it is likely that
      the IBD classification will change as well. A single classification system that
      reflects both pediatric and adult disease is needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The results of previous studies on the effectiveness of antibiotics
      in ulcerative colitis (UC) seem more effective when used orally. In this
      retrospective, multicenter study, we aimed to report our experience of using a
      combination of 3-4 antibiotics in children with moderate-severe refractory UC and
      IBD-unclassified including metronidazole, amoxicillin, doxycycline, and if during
      hospital admission, also vancomycin (MADoV). METHODS: All children treated during
      2013 with the antibiotic cocktail for 2-3weeks in an attempt to alleviate
      inflammation in refractory colitis were included. Doxycycline was substituted
      with oral gentamycin or ciprofloxacin in children younger than 8years or when an 
      allergy was known to one of the drugs. Children were assessed using the PUCAI and
      CRP weekly for 3weeks. RESULTS: All 15 included children had moderate to severe
      disease with refractory disease course to multiple immunosuppressants (mean age
      13.6+/-5.1years, median disease duration 2 (IQR 0.8-3.2) years, 11 females (73%),
      and 13 (87%) extensive disease; 14 (93%) were corticosteroid-dependent or
      resistant, and 12 (80%) refractory to anti-TNF therapy). The cocktail was
      definitely effective in 7 of the 15 included children (47%) who entered complete 
      clinical remission (PUCAI<10) without additional interventions. Questionable or
      partial short-term response was noted in another 3 (20%), totaling 67% of
      patients. CONCLUSION: The use of oral wide-spectrum antibiotic cocktail in
      pediatric UC seems promising in half of patients, refractory to other salvage
      therapy. A pediatric randomized controlled trial to assess this intervention is
      underway.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The Paris pediatric modification of the Montreal
      classification defines very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD) as a
      form of IBD distinct from that of older children. We compared the incidence and
      outcomes of VEO-IBD with those of IBD in older children. METHODS: We performed a 
      population-based retrospective cohort study of all children diagnosed with IBD in
      Ontario, Canada, from 1994 through 2009. Trends in standardized incidence were
      calculated using Poisson regression. We compared outpatient and emergency
      department visits, hospitalizations, and surgeries among children diagnosed with 
      IBD when they were younger than age 6, ages 6-9.9, and older than age 10 years.
      Multivariable models were adjusted for income and stratified by sex. RESULTS: The
      incidence of IBD increased from 9.4 per 100,000 children (95% confidence interval
      [CI], 8.2-10.8/100,000 children) in 1994 to 13.2 per 100,000 children (95% CI,
      11.9-14.6/100,000 children) in 2009 (P < .0001). The incidence increased by 7.4% 
      per year among children younger than 6 years old and 6-9.9 years old, and by 2.2%
      per year among children >/=10 years old. IBD-related outpatient visits were less 
      frequent among children <6 years old than >/=10 years old (odds ratio for female 
      patients, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.58-0.78; odds ratio for male patients, 0.86; 95% CI,
      0.75-0.98). Hazard ratios [HRs] for hospitalization were lower for children <6
      years old (female HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.56-0.87; male HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.94-1.33) 
      than for older children. HRs for surgery among children <6 years old with Crohn's
      disease were 0.35 for female patients (95% CI, 0.16-0.78) and 0.59 for male
      patients (95% CI, 0.34-0.99). HRs for children <6 years old with ulcerative
      colitis were 0.88 for female patients (95% CI, 0.47-1.63) and 0.42 for male
      patients (95% CI, 0.21-0.85). There was no difference in hospitalization or
      surgery rates among children 6-9.9 years old vs those >/=10 years old.
      CONCLUSIONS: Based on a retrospective cohort study, the incidence of VEO-IBD
      increased from 1994 through 2009. Children diagnosed with IBD before they were 6 
      years old used fewer health services and had lower rates of surgery than children
      diagnosed when they were 10 years or older.

TI  - Spontaneous colitis in Muc2-deficient mice reflects clinical and cellular
      features of active ulcerative colitis.
PG  - e100217
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0100217 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The colonic mucus layer plays a critical role in intestinal
      homeostasis by limiting contact between luminal bacteria and the mucosal immune
      system. A defective mucus barrier in animal models allows bacterial contact with 
      the intestinal epithelium and results in spontaneous colitis. A defective mucus
      barrier is also a key feature of active ulcerative colitis (UC). Alterations in
      the immune compartment due to intestinal bacterial breach in mice lacking the
      colon mucus barrier have not been characterized and correlated to active UC.
      AIMS: To characterize alterations in the immune compartment due to intestinal
      bacterial breach in Muc2-/- mice, which lack the colon mucus barrier, and
      correlate the findings to active UC. METHODS: Bacterial contact with colon
      epithelium and penetration into colon tissue was examined in Muc2-/- mice and
      colon biopsies from patients with active UC using fluorescence microscopy and
      qPCR. Neutrophils, lymphocytes, CD103+ dendritic cell subsets and macrophages in 
      colon from Muc2-/- mice and biopsies from UC patients were quantitated by flow
      cytometry. RESULTS: Inflamed UC patients and Muc2-/- mice had bacteria in contact
      with the colon epithelium. Bacterial rRNA was present in colonic mucosa in humans
      and Muc2-/- mice and in the draining lymph nodes of mice. Inflamed Muc2-/- mice
      and UC patients had elevated colon neutrophils, T cells and macrophages while a
      reduced frequency of CD103+ DCs was present in the inflamed colon of both mice
      and humans. CONCLUSIONS: The parallel features of the colon immune cell
      compartment in Muc2-/- mice and UC patients supports the usefulness of this model
      to understand the early phase of spontaneous colitis and will provide insight
      into novel strategies to treat UC.

TI  - DNA methylation-associated colonic mucosal immune and defense responses in
      treatment-naive pediatric ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1131-7
LID - 10.4161/epi.29446 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are emerging globally, indicating that
      environmental factors may be important in their pathogenesis. Colonic mucosal
      epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, can occur in response to the
      environment and have been implicated in IBD pathology. However, mucosal DNA
      methylation has not been examined in treatment-naive patients. We studied DNA
      methylation in untreated, left sided colonic biopsy specimens using the Infinium 
      HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. We analyzed 22 control (C) patients, 15
      untreated Crohn's disease (CD) patients, and 9 untreated ulcerative colitis (UC) 
      patients from two cohorts. Samples obtained at the time of clinical remission
      from two of the treatment-naive UC patients were also included into the analysis.
      UC-specific gene expression was interrogated in a subset of adjacent samples (5 C
      and 5 UC) using the Affymetrix GeneChip PrimeView Human Gene Expression Arrays.
      Only treatment-naive UC separated from control. One-hundred-and-twenty genes with
      significant expression change in UC (> 2-fold, P<0.05) were associated with
      differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Epigenetically associated gene
      expression changes (including gene expression changes in the IFITM1, ITGB2,
      S100A9, SLPI, SAA1, and STAT3 genes) were linked to colonic mucosal immune and
      defense responses. These findings underscore the relationship between epigenetic 
      changes and inflammation in pediatric treatment-naive UC and may have potential
      etiologic, diagnostic, and therapeutic relevance for IBD.

TI  - Variable access to quality nutrition information regarding inflammatory bowel
      disease: a survey of patients and health professionals and objective examination 
      of written information.
PG  - 2501-12
LID - 10.1111/hex.12219 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) report a range of
      nutritional and dietary problems and high-quality written information should be
      available on these. There is little research investigating the availability and
      quality of such information for patients with IBD. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed
      the type and quality of written information on nutrition and diet available to
      patients with IBD and the opinions of patients and health professionals. SETTING 
      AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-two patients with IBD were recruited from a large
      gastroenterology outpatient centre in England. One hundred dietitians from across
      the United Kingdom were also recruited. METHODS: Face-to-face surveys were
      conducted with patients with IBD. Questions regarding the use, format and
      usefulness of dietary information received were probed. Dietitians were surveyed 
      regarding written dietary information used in clinical practice. Samples of
      IBD-specific dietary information used across the UK were objectively assessed
      using two validated tools. MAIN RESULTS: The majority of patients rated written
      information as 'good' or 'very good', with the most useful information relating
      to 'general diet and IBD'. Forty-nine (49%) dietitians reported gaps in written
      information available for patients with IBD. Fifty-three different samples of
      IBD-specific information sheets were returned, with widely variable objective
      quality ratings. Commercially produced written information scored greater than
      locally produced information (BMA tool, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patient access to
      high-quality, written, IBD-specific dietary information is variable. IBD-specific
      written nutrition information needs to be developed in accordance with validated 
      tools to empower patients, encourage self-management and overcome nutritional
      implications of IBD.

TI  - Variants in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase complex
      components determine susceptibility to very early onset inflammatory bowel
      disease.

LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2014.06.005 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The colitis observed in patients with very early onset
      inflammatory bowel disease (VEOIBD; defined as onset of disease at younger than 6
      years of age) often resembles that of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) in
      extent and features of colonic inflammation observed by endoscopy and histology. 
      CGD is a severe immunodeficiency caused by defects in the genes that encode
      components of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase
      complex. We investigated whether variants in genes that encode NADPH oxidase
      components affect susceptibility to VEOIBD using independent approaches. METHODS:
      We performed targeted exome sequencing of genes that encode components of NADPH
      oxidases (cytochrome b light chain and encodes p22(phox) protein; cytochrome
      b-245 or NADPH oxidase 2, and encodes Nox2 or gp91(phox); neutrophil cytosol
      factor 1 and encodes p47 (phox) protein; neutrophil cytosol factor 2 and encodes 
      p67 (phox) protein; neutrophil cytosol factor 4 and encodes p40 (phox) protein;
      and Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 and 2) in 122 patients with VEOIBD
      diagnosed at The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, from 1994
      through 2012. Gene variants were validated in an independent International Early 
      Onset Pediatric IBD Cohort Study cohort of patients with VEOIBD. In a second
      approach, we examined Tag single nucleotide polymorphisms in a subset of patients
      with VEOIBD in which the NOX2 NADPH oxidase genes sequence had been previously
      analyzed. We then looked for single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with the 
      disease in an independent International Early Onset Pediatric IBD Cohort Study
      cohort of patients. We analyzed the functional effects of variants associated
      with VEOIBD. RESULTS: Targeted exome sequencing and Tag single nucleotide
      polymorphism genotyping identified 11 variants associated with VEOIBD; the
      majority of patients were heterozygous for these variants. Expression of these
      variants in cells either reduced oxidative burst or altered interactions among
      proteins in the NADPH oxidase complex. Variants in the noncoding regulatory and
      splicing elements resulted in reduced levels of proteins, or expression of
      altered forms of the proteins, in blood cells from VEOIBD patients. CONCLUSIONS: 
      We found that VEOIBD patients carry heterozygous functional hypomorphic variants 
      in components of the NOX2 NADPH oxidase complex. These do not cause overt
      immunodeficiency, but instead determine susceptibility to VEOIBD. Specific
      approaches might be developed to treat individual patients based on their genetic
      variant.

AB  - CD4 T cell activation leads to proliferation and differentiation into effector
      (Teff) or regulatory (Treg) cells that mediate or control immunity. While each
      subset prefers distinct glycolytic or oxidative metabolic programs in vitro,
      requirements and mechanisms that control T cell glucose uptake and metabolism in 
      vivo are uncertain. Despite expression of multiple glucose transporters, Glut1
      deficiency selectively impaired metabolism and function of thymocytes and Teff.
      Resting T cells were normal until activated, when Glut1 deficiency prevented
      increased glucose uptake and glycolysis, growth, proliferation, and decreased
      Teff survival and differentiation. Importantly, Glut1 deficiency decreased Teff
      expansion and the ability to induce inflammatory disease in vivo. Treg cells, in 
      contrast, were enriched in vivo and appeared functionally unaffected and able to 
      suppress Teff, irrespective of Glut1 expression. These data show a selective in
      vivo requirement for Glut1 in metabolic reprogramming of CD4 T cell activation
      and Teff expansion and survival.

TI  - Pancreatitis-associated protein has no additional value as a marker of disease
      activity in a real-life cohort of IBD patients.
PG  - 902-9
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0000000000000141 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Monitoring of mucosal inflammation in inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) is of major importance. New noninvasive markers for intestinal
      inflammation are needed. Previous studies have reported that
      pancreatitis-associated protein (PAP) correlates with clinical activity in IBD
      subgroups. Our aim was to investigate the correlation of serum and fecal PAP with
      clinical and biochemical parameters of disease activity in a real-life IBD
      cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred and five consecutive IBD patients were 
      enrolled. Clinical disease activity was scored by the Harvey-Bradshaw Index or
      the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index; also, C-reactive protein (CRP),
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and fecal calprotectin were determined. As
      surrogate for endoscopy, a combination score of clinical indices with CRP or
      calprotectin was used to define active disease. Fecal and serum PAP were measured
      by ELISA. RESULTS: The median serum and fecal PAP did not differ in Crohn's
      disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) patients with active compared with
      inactive disease according to clinical activity indices. Defining active disease 
      by a combination score of Harvey-Bradshaw Index of more than 4 and CRP of more
      than 5 mg/l or calprotectin more than 250 microg/g, serum PAP (P=0.01), but not
      fecal PAP (P=0.32), was significantly higher in active than inactive CD patients.
      Area under the curve of the corresponding receiver operating curve (ROC) was
      0.64. No differences were found in serum or fecal PAP levels using the
      combination score for active disease in UC. CONCLUSION: Serum but not fecal PAP
      was higher in active compared with nonactive CD and may reflect mucosal
      inflammation in CD, but not in UC. However, the accuracy of serum PAP for the
      diagnosis of active disease was poor, and therefore, serum PAP does not seem to
      have additional value compared with the current noninvasive markers.

AB  - Children and adolescents with Crohn's disease (CD) present often with a more
      complicated disease course compared to adult patients. In addition, the potential
      impact of CD on growth, pubertal and emotional development of patients underlines
      the need for a specific management strategy of pediatric-onset CD. To develop the
      first evidenced based and consensus driven guidelines for pediatric-onset CD an
      expert panel of 33 IBD specialists was formed after an open call within the
      European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation and the European Society of Pediatric
      Gastroenterolog, Hepatology and Nutrition. The aim was to base on a thorough
      review of existing evidence a state of the art guidance on the medical treatment 
      and long term management of children and adolescents with CD, with individualized
      treatment algorithms based on a benefit-risk analysis according to different
      clinical scenarios. In children and adolescents who did not have finished their
      growth, exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is the induction therapy of first
      choice due to its excellent safety profile, preferable over corticosteroids,
      which are equipotential to induce remission. The majority of patients with
      pediatric-onset CD require immunomodulator based maintenance therapy. The experts
      discuss several factors potentially predictive for poor disease outcome (such as 
      severe perianal fistulizing disease, severe stricturing/penetrating disease,
      severe growth retardation, panenteric disease, persistent severe disease despite 
      adequate induction therapy), which may incite to an anti-TNF-based top down
      approach. These guidelines are intended to give practical (whenever possible
      evidence-based) answers to (pediatric) gastroenterologists who take care of
      children and adolescents with CD; they are not meant to be a rule or legal
      standard, since many different clinical scenario exist requiring treatment
      strategies not covered by or different from these guidelines.

TI  - Thiopurines and risk of colorectal neoplasia in patients with inflammatory bowel 
      disease: a meta-analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at
      increased risk for developing colorectal neoplasia. Researchers have debated
      whether treatment of IBD with thiopurines reduces cancer risk. We performed a
      meta-analysis of thiopurine exposure and risk of colorectal dysplasia or cancer
      in patients with IBD. METHODS: We used MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane search
      engines and abstract books from international conferences to identify relevant
      literature. We included studies on thiopurine exposure and risk of colorectal
      neoplasia in patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. We calculated
      pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and performed a
      meta-regression analysis of the effect of year of publication. Various
      sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Fifteen studies fulfilled the
      inclusion criteria. Overall, we did not observe a significant effect of
      thiopurines on risk for colorectal neoplasia (dysplasia and/or cancer) in
      patients with IBD (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.71-1.06). The estimate did not change
      markedly in separate assessments of the 2 population-based studies (OR, 0.87; 95%
      CI, 0.59-1.29), the 13 clinic-based studies (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.59-1.09), the 7 
      cohort studies (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.67-1.28), or the 8 case-control studies (OR, 
      0.83; 95% CI, 0.65-1.08). Studies that used neoplasia (dysplasia or cancer) as
      outcomes tended to show that thiopurines had protective effects (OR for
      neoplasia, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.50-1.05); these effects were not observed in studies
      of colorectal cancer (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.72-1.12) or in studies published in
      recent years (meta-regression; P = .16). CONCLUSIONS: In a meta-analysis, we did 
      not find a significant protective effect of treatment with thiopurines on the
      risk of colorectal neoplasia in patients with IBD.

TI  - Activation of epidermal growth factor receptor mediates mucin production
      stimulated by p40, a Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG-derived protein.
PG  - 20234-44
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M114.553800 [doi]
AB  - The mucus layer coating the gastrointestinal tract serves as the first line of
      intestinal defense against infection and injury. Probiotics promote mucin
      production by goblet cells in the intestine. p40, a Lactobacillus rhamnosus
      GG-derived soluble protein, has been shown to transactivate the EGF receptor
      (EGFR) in intestinal epithelial cells, which is required for inhibition of
      apoptosis and preservation of barrier function in the colon, thereby ameliorating
      intestinal injury and colitis. Because activation of EGFR has been shown to
      up-regulate mucin production in goblet cells, the purpose of this study was to
      investigate the effects and mechanisms of p40 regulation of mucin production. p40
      activated EGFR and its downstream target, Akt, in a concentration-dependent
      manner in LS174T cells. p40 stimulated Muc2 gene expression and mucin production 
      in LS174T cells, which were abolished by inhibition of EGFR kinase activity,
      down-regulation of EGFR expression by EGFR siRNA transfection, or suppression of 
      Akt activation. Treatment with p40 increased mucin production in the colonic
      epithelium, thus thickening the mucus layer in the colon of wild type, but not of
      Egfr(wa5) mice, which have a dominant negative mutation in the EGFR kinase
      domain. Furthermore, inhibition of mucin-type O-linked glycosylation suppressed
      the effect of p40 on increasing mucin production and protecting intestinal
      epithelial cells from TNF-induced apoptosis in colon organ culture. Thus, these
      results suggest that p40-stimulated activation of EGFR mediates up-regulation of 
      mucin production, which may contribute to the mechanisms by which p40 protects
      the intestinal epithelium from injury.

TI  - Glugacon-like peptide-2: broad receptor expression, limited therapeutic effect on
      intestinal inflammation and novel role in liver regeneration.
PG  - G274-85
LID - 10.1152/ajpgi.00389.2012 [doi]
AB  - The glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2) is an intestinotrophic hormone with growth
      promoting and anti-inflammatory actions. However, the full biological functions
      of GLP-2 and the localization of its receptor (GLP-2R) remain controversial.
      Among cell lines tested, the expression of GLP-2R transcript was detected in
      human colonic myofibroblasts (CCD-18Co) and in primary culture of rat enteric
      nervous system but not in intestinal epithelial cell lines, lymphocytes,
      monocytes, or endothelial cells. Surprisingly, GLP-2R was expressed in murine
      (GLUTag), but not human (NCI-H716) enteroendocrine cells. The screening of GLP-2R
      mRNA in mice organs revealed an increasing gradient of GLP-2R toward the distal
      gut. An unexpected expression was detected in the mesenteric fat, mesenteric
      lymph nodes, bladder, spleen, and liver, particularly in hepatocytes. In two mice
      models of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)- and dextran sulfate sodium
      (DSS)-induced colitis, the colonic expression of GLP-2R mRNA was decreased by 60%
      compared with control mice. Also, GLP-2R mRNA was significantly downregulated in 
      intestinal tissues of inflammatory bowel disease patients. Therapeutically, GLP-2
      showed a weak restorative effect on intestinal inflammation during TNBS-induced
      colitis as assessed by macroscopic score and inflammatory markers. Finally, GLP-2
      treatment accelerated mouse liver regeneration following partial hepatectomy as
      assessed by histological and molecular analyses. In conclusion, the limited
      therapeutic effect of GLP-2 on colonic inflammation dampens its utility in the
      management of severe inflammatory intestinal disorders. However, the role of
      GLP-2 in liver regeneration is a novelty that might introduce GLP-2 into the
      management of liver diseases and emphasizes on the importance of elucidating
      other extraintestinal functions of GLP-2.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Fatigue is one of the main symptoms of inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) and is frequently reported by people in both active and quiescent
      disease. Many different fatigue assessment scales have been used to measure
      fatigue, but none has been developed or tested in IBD. This study aimed to
      develop a fatigue scale specific to the needs and experiences of people with IBD.
      METHODS: A five-step sequential mixed method design was used: a qualitative phase
      to assess patients' experience of fatigue and its impact on their lives, and four
      mixed qualitative-quantitative phases to refine the scale and to assess its
      psychometric properties. RESULTS: 567 people participated in five phases. The
      resulting questionnaire has 3 sections: 5 questions assessing frequency and
      severity of fatigue; 30 questions rating the experience and impact of fatigue;
      and a free-text section asking for patients' comments and additional issues
      related to fatigue. Initial validation suggests that the questionnaire has good
      face and content validity, acceptable to excellent test-retest stability (ICC
      0.74 for Section 1 and 0.83 for Section 2) and a high degree of internal
      consistency (Cronbach's alpha>0.9). CONCLUSIONS: Participants in the study
      confirmed that fatigue in IBD is burdensome. Items generated and refined by
      people with IBD-fatigue reflect their experience and form the basis of this new
      IBD-fatigue scale, which is psychometrically robust with reliability estimates
      which fall within statistically acceptable ranges. The scale can be used by
      patients and practitioners to assess severity and impact of fatigue in people
      with IBD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Data to support treatment algorithms in ambulatory paediatric UC are
      scarce. We aimed to explore the 1 year outcome in an inception cohort of
      paediatric UC patients and to identify early predictors of good outcome that
      might serve as short term treatment targets. DESIGN: A chart review of 115
      children with new onset UC was performed (age 11 +/- 4.1 years; 58 (50%) males;
      86 (75%) extensive colitis; 70 (61%) moderate-severe disease; 63 (55%) received
      steroids at baseline). We assessed the Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity
      Index (PUCAI) and laboratory variables at the time of diagnosis and at 3 months, 
      and endoscopy at diagnosis. RESULTS: The 3 month PUCAI was the strongest
      predictor of 1 year sustained steroid free remission (SSFR) (area under the
      receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC)=0.7 (95% CI 0.6 to 0.8) and
      colectomy by 2 years (AUROC=0.75 (0.6 to 0.89)). SSFR was achieved in 9/54 (17%) 
      children who had active disease (PUCAI >/= 10) at 3 months (negative predictive
      value (NPV)=83%) and by 4/46 (8.6%) of those with a PUCAI score >10; (NPV=91%,
      positive predictive value=52%; p<0.001), implying that PUCAI >10 at 3 months has 
      a probability of 9% for achieving SSFR versus 48% with a PUCAI value of </=10.
      None of the variables at baseline was predictive of SSFR or colectomy (endoscopic
      severity, disease extent, age, PUCAI or C reactive protein/erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate/albumin/haemoglobin; all AUROC<0.6, p>0.05) but baseline PUCAI
      predicted subsequent acute severe colitis and the need for salvage medical
      therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Completeness of the early response appears more important
      than baseline UC severity for predicting outcome in children, and supports using 
      PUCAI<10 as a feasible treatment goal. Our data suggest that treatment escalation
      should be considered with a PUCAI value of >/= 10 at 3 months.

PG  - 1242-9
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000061 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Utilization trends and health effects of infliximab and adalimumab in
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are incompletely understood. We aimed to
      describe utilization trends of these 2 anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents,
      determine the correlation between utilization with rates of hospitalization and
      surgery and describe differences in use between adults and children. METHODS:
      Longitudinal data were analyzed for drug utilization, hospitalization, and
      abdominal surgery. Descriptive statistics were used to show trends, and
      utilization quotients were compared for standardization. Multivariate logistic
      regression analysis assessed the association between drug use and rates of
      hospitalization and surgery. RESULTS: Four hundred thirty-eight pediatric and
      2514 adult patients with IBD generated a total of 51,882 inpatient and outpatient
      encounters, representing 1185 Crohn's disease, 1531 ulcerative colitis, and 236
      indeterminate colitis patients. From 2007 through 2012, utilization quotients
      declined for hospitalization but remained unchanged for surgery; adalimumab saw a
      3-fold increase, despite continued dominance of infliximab. Median band and mean 
      fitted plots showed downward hospitalization trends from 2006 to 2012.
      Utilization of infliximab peaked in 2008, Q4 with gradual decline to 2012, Q2;
      and adalimumab showed moderate increased utilization since 2007, Q1. Use of
      infliximab (odds ratio [OR], 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70-0.83) and
      adalimumab (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.72-0.87) was associated with decreased
      hospitalization risk but not associated with reduced abdominal surgery risk.
      Children had increased hospitalization (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 2.49-2.88) but
      decreased risk for abdominal surgery (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.46-0.70). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Current infliximab use remains substantially greater than adalimumab use, despite
      recent increased use of adalimumab. Although trends for hospitalization for IBD
      are decreasing, it is not reflected in abdominal surgery rates in a tertiary IBD 
      referral center.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Therapy for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) has changed
      dramatically in recent years with a wider use of immunomodulators and the
      introduction of antitumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents. This article reviews
      the existing data on the long-term efficacy of biologics, that is, anti-TNF
      agents, for preventing complications and surgery in patients with IBD. RECENT
      FINDINGS: Anti-TNF agents are effective for preventing endoscopic and surgical
      recurrence after surgery for Crohn's disease. They are able to achieve fistula
      closure and do not increase the risk of stricture. Most randomized short-term
      trials also showed decreased requirement for hospitalizations and surgery in
      patients receiving anti-TNF. However, observational studies from referral centers
      or based on population have shown conflicting results. The need for surgery in
      Crohn's disease and the risk of colectomy in ulcerative colitis seem to be
      decreasing in recent years, but the specific effect of the introduction of
      anti-TNF agents cannot be currently evaluated. SUMMARY: Although anti-TNF agents 
      are the most powerful drugs in IBD, their ability to decrease the need for
      surgery remains unclear. Conflicting results observed in observational surveys
      might be because of anti-TNF agents administered too late in the course of IBD.

AB  - Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection has emerged as a significant
      clinical challenge for patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 
      C. difficile can both precipitate and worsen flares of IBD, contributing to
      emergent colectomies and mortality. Advances in the management of C. difficile
      infection in IBD include recommendations for testing for this infection in the
      setting of clinical flare and hospitalization, improved diagnostic testing,
      identification of high rates of carriage and infection in pediatric IBD, and new 
      data associating patterns of IBD genetic risk alleles with the development of
      this infection. Therapeutically, oral vancomycin has emerged as a superior
      treatment for IBD patients with moderate to severe disease compared with
      metronidazole. Although highly effective in the general population, fecal
      microbiome transplantation for recurrent C. difficile infection in IBD patients
      has been associated with colitis flare in the majority of patients who have
      received this treatment.

TI  - Outcome measures for clinical trials in paediatric IBD: an evidence-based,
      expert-driven practical statement paper of the paediatric ECCO committee.
PG  - 438-46
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2014-307008 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although paediatric-onset IBD is becoming more common, few medications
      have a registered paediatric indication. There are multiple hurdles to performing
      clinical trials in children, emphasising the importance of choosing an
      appropriate outcome measure, which can facilitate enrolment, and thereby also
      drug approval. The aim of this consensus statement is to highlight paediatric
      specific issues and key factors critical for the optimal conduct of paediatric
      IBD trials. DESIGN: The Paediatric European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation
      (ECCO) committee has established an international expert panel to determine the
      best outcome measures in paediatric IBD, following a literature search and a
      modified Delphi process. All recommendations were endorsed by at least 80%
      agreement. RESULTS: Recognising the importance of mucosal healing (MH), the panel
      defined steroid-free MH as primary outcome measure for all drugs of new category 
      with one or two postintervention endoscopies per trial (at 8-12 weeks and/or 54
      weeks). Since endoscopic evaluation is a barrier for recruitment in children,
      trials with medications already shown to induce MH in children or adults, could
      use paediatric-specific disease activity scores as primary outcome, including a
      modified Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index in Crohn's disease and the
      Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index in UC. Secondary outcomes should
      include safety issues, MR enterography-based damage and inflammatory scores (in
      Crohn's disease), faecal calprotectin, quality of life scales, and a
      patient-reported outcome. CONCLUSIONS: It is crucial to perform paediatric trials
      early in the development of new drugs in order to reduce off-label use of IBD
      medication in children. The thoughtful choice of feasible and standardised
      outcome measures can help move us towards this goal.

AB  - Inflammation plays an integral part in tumor initiation. Specifically, patients
      with colitis, pancreatitis, or hepatitis have an increased susceptibility to
      cancer. The activation, mutation, and overexpression of oncogenes have been well 
      documented in cell proliferation and transformation. Recently, oncogenes were
      found to also regulate the inflammatory milieu in tumors. Similarly, the
      inflammatory milieu can promote oncogene activation. In this review, we summarize
      advances of the symbiotic relationship oncogene activation and inflammation in
      gastrointestinal tumors such as colorectal, hepatic, and pancreatic tumors.
      NF-kappaB and STAT3 are the two most common pathways that are deregulated via
      these oncogenes. Understanding these interactions may yield effective therapeutic
      strategies for tumor prevention and treatment.

TI  - Novel de novo mutations of the interleukin-10 receptor gene lead to infantile
      onset inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1551-6

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Defects in the interleukin 10 (IL-10) signalling pathway
      have been shown to cause very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We
      report a patient with severe infantile-onset IBD with a compound heterozygous
      IL-10 receptor alpha subunit (IL-10RA) mutation, one of which was
      paternally-inherited and the other occurring de novo. METHODS: Deep sequencing of
      IL-10, IL-10RA and IL-10 receptor beta subunit (IL-10RB) were performed.
      Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) surface expression of IL-10RA was
      analysed by flow cytometry. IL-10 signalling pathway was examined by measuring
      phosphorylated STAT3 in PBMC cultured in the presence of IL-6 or IL-10. RESULT:
      We identified a missense mutation in exon 4 of IL-10RA (c.583T>C) in one allele
      and a nonsense mutation in exon 7 of IL-10RA (c.1368G>T) in the other allele.
      Neither mutation has been reported previously. The patient has functional IL-10RA
      deficiency despite normal IL-10RA expression. CONCLUSION: This represents the
      first case report of a de novo mutation of IL-10RA that is associated with very
      early onset severe IBD. Therefore, IL-10 pathway defect should be considered in
      patients with infantile-onset IBD even if the parents are non-consanguineous.

PG  - 447-58
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2013-306423 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteria play a role in the onset and perpetuation of intestinal
      inflammation in IBD. Compositional alterations may also change the metabolic
      capacities of the gut bacteria. OBJECTIVE: To examine the metabolic activity of
      the microbiota of patients with Crohn's disease (CD), UC or pouchitis compared
      with healthy controls (HC) and determine whether eventual differences might be
      related to the pathogenesis of the disease. METHODS: Faecal samples were obtained
      from 40 HC, 83 patients with CD, 68 with UC and 13 with pouchitis. Disease
      activity was assessed in CD using the Harvey-Bradshaw Index, in UC using the UC
      Disease Activity Index and in pouchitis using the Pouchitis Disease Activity
      Index. Metabolite profiles were analysed using gas chromatography-mass
      spectrometry. RESULTS: The number of metabolites identified in HC (54) was
      significantly higher than in patients with CD (44, p<0.001), UC (47, p=0.042) and
      pouchitis (43, p=0.036). Multivariate discriminant analysis predicted HC, CD, UC 
      and pouchitis group membership with high sensitivity and specificity. The levels 
      of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs: pentanoate, hexanoate, heptanoate, octanoate 
      and nonanoate), and of some protein fermentation metabolites, were significantly 
      decreased in patients with CD, UC and pouchitis. Hexanoate levels were inversely 
      correlated to disease activity in CD (correlation coefficient=-0.157, p=0.046),
      whereas a significant positive correlation was found between styrene levels and
      disease activity in UC (correlation coefficient=0.338, p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS:
      Faecal metabolic profiling in patients with IBD relative to healthy controls
      identified MCFAs as important metabolic biomarkers of disease-related changes.

      Symptoms Module for patients with functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders
      (FGIDs) and organic GI diseases, hereafter referred to as "GI disorders," for
      patient self-report ages between 5 and 18 and parent proxy-report for ages
      between 2 and 18 years. METHODS: The 74-item PedsQL GI Module and 23-item PedsQL 
      Generic Core Scales were completed in a 9-site study by 584 patients and 682
      parents. Patients had physician-diagnosed GI disorders (such as chronic
      constipation, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, functional
      dyspepsia, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease).
      RESULTS: Fourteen unidimensional scales were derived measuring stomach pain,
      stomach discomfort when eating, food and drink limits, trouble swallowing,
      heartburn and reflux, nausea and vomiting, gas and bloating, constipation, blood,
      diarrhea, worry, medicines, and communication. The PedsQL GI Module Scales
      evidenced excellent feasibility, excellent reliability for the Total Scale Scores
      (patient self-report alpha = 0.97, parent proxy-report alpha = 0.97), and
      good-to-excellent reliability for the 14 individual scales (patient self-report
      alpha = 0.67-0.94, parent proxy-report alpha = 0.77-0.95). Intercorrelations with
      the Generic Core Scales supported construct validity. Individual Symptoms Scales 
      known-groups validity across 7 GI disorders was generally supported. Factor
      analysis supported the unidimensionality of the individual scales. CONCLUSIONS:
      The PedsQL GI Module Scales demonstrated acceptable-to-excellent measurement
      properties and may be used as common metrics to compare GI-specific symptoms in
      clinical research and practice both within and across patient groups for FGIDs
      and organic GI diseases.

AB  - Intact interleukin-10 receptor (IL-10R) signaling on effector and T regulatory
      (Treg) cells are each independently required to maintain immune tolerance. Here
      we show that IL-10 sensing by innate immune cells, independent of its effects on 
      T cells, was critical for regulating mucosal homeostasis. Following wild-type
      (WT) CD4(+) T cell transfer, Rag2(-/-)Il10rb(-/-) mice developed severe colitis
      in association with profound defects in generation and function of Treg cells.
      Moreover, loss of IL-10R signaling impaired the generation and function of
      anti-inflammatory intestinal and bone-marrow-derived macrophages and their
      ability to secrete IL-10. Importantly, transfer of WT but not Il10rb(-/-)
      anti-inflammatory macrophages ameliorated colitis induction by WT CD4(+) T cells 
      in Rag2(-/-)Il10rb(-/-) mice. Similar alterations in the generation and function 
      of anti-inflammatory macrophages were observed in IL-10R-deficient patients with 
      very early onset inflammatory bowel disease. Collectively, our studies define
      innate immune IL-10R signaling as a key factor regulating mucosal immune
      homeostasis in mice and humans.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0096153 [doi]
AB  - Human colonic mucosa altered by inflammation due to ulcerative colitis (UC)
      displays a drastically altered pattern of gene expression compared with healthy
      tissue. We aimed to understand the underlying molecular pathways influencing
      these differences by analyzing three publically-available,
      independently-generated microarray datasets of gene expression from endoscopic
      biopsies of the colon. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that all
      three datasets share 87 gene sets upregulated in UC lesions and 8 gene sets
      downregulated (false discovery rate <0.05). The upregulated pathways were
      dominated by gene sets involved in immune function and signaling, as well as the 
      control of mitosis. We applied pathway analysis to genotype data derived from
      genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of UC, consisting of 5,584 cases and
      11,587 controls assembled from eight European-ancestry cohorts. The upregulated
      pathways derived from the gene expression data showed a highly significant
      overlap with pathways derived from the genotype data (33 of 56 gene sets,
      hypergeometric P = 1.49 x 10(-19)). This study supports the hypothesis that
      heritable variation in gene expression as measured by GWAS signals can influence 
      key pathways in the development of disease, and that comparison of genetic
      susceptibility loci with gene expression signatures can differentiate key drivers
      of inflammation from secondary effects on gene expression of the inflammatory
      process.

TI  - The prevalence of Clostridium difficile infection in pediatric and adult patients
      with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 2222-7
LID - 10.1007/s10620-014-3169-4 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have a high prevalence
      of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). CDI in children with IBD may differ
      from adults. We aim to compare the prevalence of CDI in hospitalized pediatric
      and adult IBD patients and patients without IBD. METHODS: The rates of CDI per
      1,000 IBD and non-IBD hospitalizations between 1993 and 2012 were examined using 
      the Maryland Health Services Cost Review Commission database. Age, sex and
      calendar year adjusted incidence rate ratios comparing CDI in pediatrics and
      adults by type of IBD and with patients without IBD were calculated. p values for
      trend identifying changes in rates over time were calculated. RESULTS: Among
      children, the rate of CDI was over 12 times greater in IBD than non-IBD
      hospitalizations (p < 0.0001) and among adults, the rate of CDI was four times
      greater in IBD than non-IBD hospitalizations (p < 0.0001). In adults, CDI was
      significantly higher in ulcerative colitis (UC) than Crohn's disease (60.4 per
      1,000 vs. 19.8 per 1,000, p < 0.0001) but in children there was no difference in 
      CDI in UC compared with Crohn's disease (32 per 1,000 vs. 27 per 1,000, p =
      0.45). The prevalence of CDI increased in pediatric and adult IBD patients, and
      patients without IBD, between 1993 and 2012 (p for trend <0.0001). CONCLUSIONS:
      CDI was more common in adult patients with UC, and no difference was found
      between CDI and IBD type in pediatrics. There may be different risk factors for
      CDI during hospitalization between adults and children with IBD.

TI  - Very early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in infancy is a different
      disease entity from adult-onset IBD; one form of interleukin-10 receptor
      mutations.
PG  - 337-41

AB  - Infantile periods may have stronger genetic influences. Recently, studies on
      genetic defects in the interleukin-10 (IL-10) signaling pathway have provided new
      insights into inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study is to reveal whether
      mutations of IL-10 signaling pathway genes contribute to the phenotypes of IBD.
      Forty children who were diagnosed with IBD below the age of 10 years were
      enrolled. We sequenced the genes interleukin-10 receptor A (IL-10RA), IL-10RB and
      IL-10, and analyzed the clinical characteristics of very early-onset IBD
      (VEO-IBD). In total, 14 out of the 40 children developed their symptoms within 1 
      year of age. We found mutations in IL-10RA in 7 out of the 40 children (17.5%).
      All seven children had developed symptoms within the first year of life.
      Particularly, half of the children with infantile-onset IBD had IL-10RA
      mutations. None of the remaining 26 children diagnosed above 1 year of age had
      IL-10RA mutations. No mutations were found in IL-10RB and IL-10. Identified
      IL-10RA mutations were p.(R101W), p.(Y91C), p.(R262C), p.(R117H) and p.(W69R).
      IL-10RA mutations were associated with onset of infancy (P<0.001), perianal
      fistulae (P<0.001), poor response to medical management (P=0.017) and early
      surgical interventions (P<0.001). VEO-IBD in infancy is phenotypically and
      genetically different disease entity from adult-onset or older child-onset IBD.
      It has a strong association with IL-10 receptor gene. We should consider the
      genotyping of genes of the IL-10 signaling pathway including IL-10RA in patients 
      with VEO-IBD, especially in whom with onset of perianal fistulae and severe
      colitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Sleep deprivation is associated with production of
      inflammatory cytokines. Disturbed sleep quality has been associated with
      increased risk of disease flare in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) or
      ulcerative colitis (UC). However, the association between sleep and risk of
      incident CD and UC has not been previously examined. METHODS: We conducted a
      prospective study of women who were enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) I 
      since 1976 and NHS II since 1989 and followed through detailed biennial
      questionnaires with >90% follow-up. We examined the association of sleep duration
      reported in 1986 in NHS I and 2001 in NHS II with incident CD and UC, diagnosed
      through 2010, in NHS I and 2009 in NHS II. Cox proportional hazards models
      adjusting for potential confounders were used to calculate hazard ratios and 95% 
      confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Among 151,871 women, we confirmed 191 cases 
      of CD (incidence, 8/100,000 person-years) and 230 cases of UC (incidence,
      10/100,000 person-years) over 2,292,849 person-years. Compared with women with
      reported usual sleep durations of 7-8 h/day (incidence, 8/100,000 person-years), 
      women with reported sleep duration <6 h/day (11/100,000 person-years) or >9 h/day
      (20/100,000 person-years) had a higher incidence of UC (P < .05). The
      multivariate hazard ratios for UC were 1.51 (95% CI, 1.10-2.09) for sleep
      durations <6 h/day and 2.05 (95% CI, 1.44-2.92) for sleep durations >9 h/day,
      compared with sleep durations of 7-8 h/day. In contrast, sleep duration did not
      modify risk of CD. Duration of rotating night shift work was not associated with 
      CD or UC. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of data from the NHS I and II, less than 6
      hours sleep/day and more than 9 hours sleep/day are each associated with an
      increased risk of UC. Further studies are needed to evaluate sleep as a
      modifiable risk factor in the pathogenesis and progression of IBD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Health administrative databases can be used to track disease
      incidence, outcomes, and care quality. Case validation is necessary to ensure
      accurate disease ascertainment using these databases. In this study, we aimed to 
      validate adult-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) identification algorithms. 
      STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We used two large cohorts of incident patients from
      Ontario, Canada to validate algorithms. We linked information extracted from
      charts to health administrative data and compared the accuracy of various
      algorithms. In addition, we validated an algorithm to distinguish patients with
      Crohn's from those with ulcerative colitis and assessed the adequate look-back
      period to distinguish incident from prevalent cases. RESULTS: Over 5,000
      algorithms were tested. The most accurate algorithm to identify patients 18 to 64
      years at diagnosis was five physician contacts or hospitalizations within 4 years
      (sensitivity, 76.8%; specificity, 96.2%; positive predictive value (PPV), 81.4%; 
      negative predictive value (NPV), 95.0%). In patients >/=65 years at diagnosis,
      adding a pharmacy claim for an IBD-related medication improved accuracy.
      CONCLUSION: Patients with adult-onset incident IBD can be accurately identified
      from within health administrative data. The validated algorithms will be applied 
      to administrative data to expand the Ontario Crohn's and Colitis Cohort to all
      patients with IBD in the province of Ontario.

PG  - 4768

AB  - Although vitamin K deficiency has been implicated in adult inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD), its prevalence in pediatric IBD remains unknown. We carried out a 
      cross-sectional study in 63 children with Crohn's disease (CD) and 48 with
      ulcerative colitis (UC) to assess the prevalence of vitamin K deficiency and to
      search for potential correlation between vitamin K status and pediatric IBD
      activity. Vitamin K status was assessed using protein induced by vitamin K
      absence-II (PIVKA-II; ELISA). Prevalence of vitamin K deficiency was 54.0% in CD 
      and 43.7% in UC. Vitamin K deficiency was more common in patients with higher CD 
      activity, in CD patients with higher mass Z-scores, and less common among
      children with CD treated with infliximab. Relation of vitamin K deficiency to
      pediatric IBD clinical course and treatment demand further research.

TI  - Increased risk of stroke among patients with ulcerative colitis: a
      population-based matched cohort study.
PG  - 805-12
LID - 10.1007/s00384-014-1862-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and the development of
      atherosclerosis are increased in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 
      Ulcerative colitis (UC) is one type of IBD; however, there is controversy in the 
      literature regarding the association between UC and stroke. The present cohort
      study estimated the risk of subsequent stroke among UC patients compared with
      that among matched comparison subjects drawn from a population-based data set in 
      Taiwan. METHODS: This investigation analyzed administrative claims data sourced
      from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database. Our study consisted of a
      study cohort comprising 516 UC patients and a comparison cohort of 2,579 subjects
      without IBD. Cox proportional hazards regressions were performed to estimate the 
      risk of subsequent stroke during the follow-up period. We also conducted
      additional analyses investigating the risk of subsequent stroke by age group and 
      gender. RESULTS: After adjusting for selected medical co-morbidities and recent
      prescriptions of selected pharmaceuticals, the hazard ratio (HR) for subsequent
      stroke among patients with UC was 2.045 (95 % confidence interval (CI) =
      1.374-3.043) than that among comparison subjects. While we did not detect an
      association between stroke and UC among patients aged 30-40 or 40-50 years, we
      did detect increased risks for stroke among UC patients aged over 50 years (HR = 
      2.045). We also found the association to remain significant for both men (HR =
      2.153) and women (HR = 2.750). CONCLUSIONS: This study detected an increased HR
      for subsequent stroke among Taiwanese UC patients hen compared to that among
      matched comparison patients without IBD.

TI  - Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in SLC22A23 are associated with ulcerative
      colitis in a Canadian white cohort.
PG  - 289-94
LID - 10.3945/ajcn.113.080549 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: SLC22A23 is an orphan gene in the SLC22 family of organic membrane
      transporters, and its single-nucleotide polymorphism rs17309827-T was recently
      nominally associated with intestinal inflammation in a genome-wide association
      study. Other polymorphisms in the SLC22A23 gene have been associated with
      diseases with an inflammatory component, and polymorphisms in related genes in
      the SLC22 family have been repeatedly associated with inflammatory bowel disease 
      (IBD). OBJECTIVE: In a candidate-gene study using a well-phenotyped, highly
      monitored, Manitoban white cohort, we investigated whether variations in SLC22A23
      were associated with intestinal inflammation. DESIGN: Selected genetic variations
      were genotyped by using fluorescent-based assays or a polymerase chain
      reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis in 160 individuals
      with Crohn disease, 149 individuals with ulcerative colitis, and 142 healthy
      control subjects to determine genetic associations. RESULTS: Homozygocity for
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs4959235-TT and rs950318-GG was associated with 
      IBD, whereby 6% of patients (18 of 311 cases) carried these genotypes, but they
      were not seen in healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Associations reported in this
      article add to the emerging evidence that SLC22A23 variants could modify IBD
      risk. However, the biology of the gene and impact of variations on the gene's
      functions need to be tested to validate a causative role.

TI  - Effects in the use of a genetically engineered strain of Lactococcus lactis
      delivering in situ IL-10 as a therapy to treat low-grade colon inflammation.
PG  - 1611-21
LID - 10.4161/hv.28549 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a gastrointestinal disorder characterized by
      chronic abdominal pain, discomfort, and bloating. Interestingly, there is now
      evidence of the presence of a low-grade inflammatory status in many IBS patients,
      including histopathological and mucosal cytokine levels in the colon, as well as 
      the presence of IBS-like symptoms in quiescent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 
      The use of a genetically engineered food-grade bacterium, such as Lactococcus
      lactis, secreting the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 has been proven by many
      pre-clinical studies to be a successful therapy to treat colon inflammation. In
      this study, we first reproduced the recovery-recurrence periods observed in
      IBS-patients in a new chronic model characterized by 2 episodes of
      DiNitro-BenzeneSulfonic-acid (DNBS)-challenge and we tested the effects of a
      recombinant strain of L. lactis secreting IL-10 under a Stress-Inducible
      Controlled Expression (SICE) system. In vivo gut permeability, colonic serotonin 
      levels, cytokine profiles, and spleen cell populations were then measured as
      readouts of a low-grade inflammation. In addition, since there is increasing
      evidence that gut microbiota tightly regulates gut barrier function, tight
      junction proteins were also measured by qRT-PCR after administration of
      recombinant L. lactis in DNBS-treated mice. Strikingly, oral administration of L.
      lactis secreting active IL-10 in mice resulted in significant protective effects 
      in terms of permeability, immune activation, and gut-function parameters.
      Although genetically engineered bacteria are, for now, used only as a
      "proof-of-concept," our study validates the interest in the use of the novel SICE
      system in L. lactis to express therapeutic molecules, such as IL-10, locally at
      mucosal surfaces.

AB  - The fourth scientific workshop of the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization
      (ECCO) focused on the relevance of intestinal fibrosis in the disease course of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The objective was to better understand the
      pathophysiological mechanisms of intestinal fibrosis, to identify useful markers 
      and imaging modalities of fibrosis in order to assess its presence and
      progression, and, finally, to point out possible approaches for the prevention
      and the treatment of fibrosis. The results of this workshop are presented in
      three separate manuscripts. This first section describes the most important
      mechanisms that contribute to the initiation and progression of intestinal
      fibrosis in IBD including the cellular and molecular mediators, the extracellular
      matrix molecules and matrix metalloproteinases/tissue inhibitors of
      metalloproteinases-system, the microbiota products, the role of fat, genetic and 
      epigenetic factors, as well as the currently available experimental models.
      Furthermore, it identifies unanswered questions in the field of intestinal
      fibrosis and provides a framework for future research.

TI  - Chronic non-bloody diarrhoea: a prospective study in Malmo, Sweden, with focus on
      microscopic colitis.
PG  - 236
LID - 10.1186/1756-0500-7-236 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic non-bloody diarrhoea affects up to 5% of the population.
      Microscopic colitis is one of the most common causes, encompassing the subtypes
      collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis. The diagnosis of microscopic colitis
      is made by histological examination of colonic mucosal biopsy specimens. The aim 
      of this investigation was to determine whether laboratory parameters or questions
      about disease history or concomitant disease could be helpful in discriminating
      patients with MC from those with a histologically normal colonic mucosa.
      FINDINGS: Patients admitted for colonoscopy because of chronic non-bloody
      diarrhoea (>2 loose stools for >3 weeks) at endoscopy units in Malmo during 2007 
      and 2009, were enrolled. A total number of 78 patients were included (60 women,
      18 men, median age 59, IQR 45-69 years). Out of these 78, 15 patients (19%) had
      microscopic colitis (CC; n = 10, LC; n = 5). MC was especially prevalent in
      patients above the age of 50 (25%). No differences were found between those with 
      normal histology and MC in laboratory analyses (inflammatory and liver
      parameters). Neither were differences shown in questions regarding symptoms,
      environmental factors or concomitant diseases except for an association with
      celiac disease (p = 0.019) and a trend maybe indicating an inverse association
      with appendectomy (p = 0.057). CONCLUSIONS: Microscopic colitis is associated
      with female gender, celiac disease and consumption of NSAIDs. Trends were
      observed indicating that age above 50 years, acute onset and absence of
      appendectomy may be associated with MC. No associations were observed with other 
      symptoms, calprotectin levels or liver parameters.

AB  - This is a consensus of the Austrian working group of IBD (inflammatory bowel
      diseases) of the OGGH on nutrition in IBD. Malnutrition should be assessed in
      case of IBD (in 20 - 70 % of Crohn's patients) and weight loss(> 5 % within 3
      months) or nutritional deficiencies or after extensive bowel resection and
      afterwards also treated. Malnutrition should be treated with medical therapy of
      IBD and also adequate - as far as possible - with oral nutritional therapy
      particularly because of reduced life quality, risk of opportunistic infections,
      osteopenia/osteoporosis, longer hospitalisations and higher mortality. Iron
      homeostasis, serum levels of Vitamin B12- and folic acid, 25-hydroxyvitamin D and
      zinc should be checked. Therapy with enteral liquid diets is only indicated as
      therapy of first choice in children and adolescents, but only in rare situations 
      in adults with IBD. There is - up to now - no proven oral diet for maintenance of
      remission in IBD. Probiotics as E. coli Nissle could be used as alternative to
      mesalazine for maintenance of remission in patients with ulcerative colitis. A
      specific dietary counselling is mandatory in patients with ileostoma or short
      bowel syndrome. Malnutrition of short bowel patients is particularly dependent on
      the function and length of the remaining bowel, therefore the most effective
      medical therapy should be administered.

TI  - Protective mucosal immunity mediated by epithelial CD1d and IL-10.
PG  - 497-502
LID - 10.1038/nature13150 [doi]
AB  - The mechanisms by which mucosal homeostasis is maintained are of central
      importance to inflammatory bowel disease. Critical to these processes is the
      intestinal epithelial cell (IEC), which regulates immune responses at the
      interface between the commensal microbiota and the host. CD1d presents self and
      microbial lipid antigens to natural killer T (NKT) cells, which are involved in
      the pathogenesis of colitis in animal models and human inflammatory bowel
      disease. As CD1d crosslinking on model IECs results in the production of the
      important regulatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 (ref. 9), decreased epithelial 
      CD1d expression--as observed in inflammatory bowel disease--may contribute
      substantially to intestinal inflammation. Here we show in mice that whereas
      bone-marrow-derived CD1d signals contribute to NKT-cell-mediated intestinal
      inflammation, engagement of epithelial CD1d elicits protective effects through
      the activation of STAT3 and STAT3-dependent transcription of IL-10, heat shock
      protein 110 (HSP110; also known as HSP105), and CD1d itself. All of these
      epithelial elements are critically involved in controlling CD1d-mediated
      intestinal inflammation. This is demonstrated by severe NKT-cell-mediated colitis
      upon IEC-specific deletion of IL-10, CD1d, and its critical regulator microsomal 
      triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), as well as deletion of HSP110 in the
      radioresistant compartment. Our studies thus uncover a novel pathway of
      IEC-dependent regulation of mucosal homeostasis and highlight a critical role of 
      IL-10 in the intestinal epithelium, with broad implications for diseases such as 
      inflammatory bowel disease.

      phenotypes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) diagnosis requires
      comprehensive examination of the patient. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and
      Escherichia coli have been reported as representatives of Inflammatory Bowel
      Disease (IBD) dysbiosis. The aim was to determine whether or not quantification
      of these species can be used as a complementary tool either for diagnostic or
      prognostic purposes. METHODS: Mucosa-associated F. prausnitzii and E. coli
      abundance was determined in 28 controls (H), 45 CD, 28 UC patients and 10
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) subjects by quantitative polymerase chain reaction
      (qPCR) and the F. prausnitzii-E. coli index (F-E index) was calculated. Species
      abundances were normalized to total bacteria and human cells. Data was analyzed
      taking into account patients' phenotype and most relevant clinical
      characteristics. RESULTS: IBD patients had lower F. prausnitzii abundance than H 
      and IBS (P<0.001). CD patients showed higher E. coli counts than H and UC
      patients (P<0.001). The F-E index discriminated between H, CD and UC patients,
      and even between disease phenotypes that are usually difficult to distinguish as 
      ileal-CD (I-CD) from ileocolonic-CD and colonic-CD from extensive colitis. E.
      coli increased in active CD patients, and remission in I-CD patients was
      compromised by high abundance of this species. Treatment with anti-tumor necrosis
      factor (TNF) alpha diminished E. coli abundance in I-CD whereas none of the
      treatments counterbalanced F. prausnitzii depletion. CONCLUSION: F. prausnitzii
      and E. coli are useful indicators to assist in IBD phenotype classification. The 
      abundance of these species could also be used as a supporting prognostic tool in 
      I-CD patients. Our data indicates that current medication does not restore the
      levels of these two species to those found in a healthy gut.

      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 3191-7
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i12.3191 [doi]
AB  - Growth and nutritional status are important issues in paediatric inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD). While linear growth is easy to assess, nutritional status is
      more complicated, with reports often compromised by the use of simple measures,
      such as weight and the body mass index, to assess nutritional status rather than 
      more appropriate and sophisticated techniques to measure body composition. This
      review is an update on what is currently known about nutritional status as
      determined by body composition in paediatric IBD. Further, this review will focus
      on the impact of biologics on growth in paediatric IBD. Significant lean mass
      deficits have been reported in children with IBD compared with controls, and
      there is evidence these deficits persist over time. Furthermore, data imply that 
      gender differences exist in body composition, both at diagnosis and in response
      to treatment. With respect to growth improvements following treatment with
      biologics, there are conflicting data. While some studies report enhancement of
      growth, others do not. The relationship between disease severity, impaired growth
      and the requirement for biologics needs to be considered when interpreting these 
      data. However, key features associated with improvements in growth appear to be
      successful clinical response to treatment, patients in early stages of puberty,
      and the presence of growth failure at the onset of treatment.

LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000029 [doi]
AB  - The epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract is one of the most versatile tissues
      in the organism, responsible for providing a tight barrier between dietary and
      bacterial antigens and the mucosal and systemic immune system while maintaining
      efficient digestive and absorptive processes to ensure adequate nutrient and
      energy supply. Inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis) are associated with a breakdown of both functions, which in some cases
      are clearly interrelated. In this updated literature review, we focus on the
      effects of intestinal inflammation and the associated immune mediators on
      selected aspects of the transepithelial transport of macronutrients and
      micronutrients. The mechanisms responsible for nutritional deficiencies are not
      always clear and could be related to decreased intake, malabsorption, and excess 
      losses. We summarize the known causes of nutrient deficiencies and the mechanism 
      of inflammatory bowel disease-associated diarrhea. We also overview the
      consequences of impaired epithelial transport, which infrequently transcend its
      primary purpose to affect the gut microbial ecology and epithelial integrity.
      Although some of those regulatory mechanisms are relatively well established,
      more work needs to be done to determine how inflammatory cytokines can alter the 
      transport process of nutrients across the gastrointestinal and renal epithelia.

PG  - 667-75

AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an idiopathic chronic inflammatory disorder that
      affects the colonic mucosa. One class among the drugs used for its treatment is
      the 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASAs). While highly efficacious in treating
      mild-to-moderate UC, 5-ASAs are associated with rare but potentially
      life-threatening side effects such as pericarditis, myocarditis and pneumonitis. 
      These adverse events appear to be caused by a hypersensitivity reaction and
      resolve after cessation of 5-ASA drugs. This article presents a case report of
      febrile pleuropericarditis in a UC patient treated with balsalazide, and provides
      a thorough literature review of the rare side effects of 5-ASAs, their incidence,
      clinical presentation, differential diagnosis and treatment. In conclusion, the
      clinicians should be aware that this type of adverse events to 5-ASA compounds
      can be easily overlooked but it has significant morbidity if not promptly
      diagnosed.

TI  - National Trends and In-Hospital Outcomes of Adult Patients With Inflammatory
      Bowel Disease Receiving Parenteral Nutrition Support.
PG  - 412-6
LID - 10.1177/0148607114528715 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's
      disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are susceptible to protein-calorie
      malnutrition secondary to decreased oral intake, malabsorption, and increased
      metabolic expenditure. In this study, we seek to assess the national frequencies 
      of parenteral nutrition (PN) use among hospitalized patients with IBD and to
      determine their in-hospital outcomes. METHODS: We analyzed the Nationwide
      Inpatient Sample from 1988-2006 to determine the frequency of PN usage among
      patients with UC or CD and to determine their in-hospital outcomes. A
      multivariate analysis was performed to identify factors predictive of increased
      inpatient mortality in this population. RESULTS: From 1988-2006, the annual
      incidence of PN use among hospitalized patients with CD was 4.29 per 100,000 and 
      among those with UC was 3.80 per 100,000, with trends being relatively stable
      through the indexed period. The mean length of hospitalization among patients
      with UC receiving PN was longer compared with patients with CD. Factors
      predictive of an increased risk for mortality include the following: age >50
      years, acute kidney injury, hospital-acquired pneumonia, Clostridium difficile
      colitis, prolonged postoperative ileus requiring PN use, pulmonary embolism,
      malnutrition, and patients with UC relative to CD. CONCLUSION: Traditionally,
      patients with CD are at a higher risk for developing malnutrition than patients
      with UC; however, there is a 2-fold higher risk for inpatient mortality and a
      longer length of hospitalization among patients with UC compared with those with 
      CD. This pattern suggests that the use of PN, particularly among patients with
      UC, serves as a surrogate marker of higher disease acuity and severity.

AB  - Under conventional conditions, mice deficient in core 1-derived O-glycans (TM-IEC
      C1galt1(-/-)), which have a defective mucus layer, experienced spontaneous
      inflammation of the colon. Analysis of fecal bacterial populations by
      pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene showed that disease in conventional TM-IEC
      C1galt1(-/-) was associated with shifts in the microbiota manifested by increases
      in Lactobacillus and Clostridium species, and decreases in unclassified
      Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae. Under germ-free (GF) conditions, TM-IEC
      C1galt1(-/-) presented decreased goblet cells, but did not develop inflammation. 
      Monoassociation of GF TM-IEC C1galt1(-/-) revealed that bacterial species differ 
      significantly in their ability to induce inflammatory changes. Bacteroides
      thetaiotaomicron caused inflammation, while Lactobacillus johnsonii (enriched
      during colitis) did not. These observations demonstrate that not all microbiota
      shifts that correlate with disease contribute to pathogenesis.

AB  - Thiopurines and biologics are being used earlier and more frequently for the
      treatment of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. These medications are
      generally well tolerated and usually do not require cessation due to a side
      effect. Rare but serious infections and cancers may develop in patients on these 
      immunosuppressants. Evidence-based data are lacking to guide physicians on
      whether continuing or stopping thiopurines and biologics is necessary and, when a
      side effect does occur, if and when restarting these medications is feasible. The
      aim of this review was to outline the infectious and malignant complications that
      may develop on these treatments and to provide recommendations for continuing,
      stopping, and restarting thiopurines and biologics once a patient develops a
      treatment-related complication. These are not formal guidelines and should not
      replace individualized care by the treating physician.

      pediatric inflammatory bowel disease severity and activity.
PG  - 99-102
AB  - AIMS: Accurate assessment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) activity is the
      cornerstone of effective therapy. Fecal M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase (M2-PK) and
      fecal calprotectin (FC) are noninvasive markers of mucosal inflammation in IBD.
      The aim of this study was to compare performance of M2-PK and FC in assessment of
      pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) severity and activity.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: 121 patients with IBD, including 75 with UC and 46 with CD
      were recruited. Control group consisted of 35 healthy children (HS). Patients
      were assigned to groups depending on disease severity and activity. M2-PK and
      calprotectin concentration were determined in stool samples using ELISA. Areas
      under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) for FC and M2-PK with
      cut-off level at which M2-PK specificity was matching FC specificity were
      calculated and compared. RESULTS: Performance of M2-PK at identifying patients
      with IBD, UC and CD among HS was inferior to FC. The differences in AUC were
      respectively: -0.10 (95% confidence interval [CI] [-0.13-(-0.06)], p<0.0001),
      -0.14 (95% CI [-0.19-(-0.09)], p<0.0001) and -0.03 (95% CI [-0.05-(-0.001)],
      p<0.02). M2-PK was inferior to FC in discriminating patients with mild UC from
      those with HS (AUC difference -0.23, 95% CI [-0.31-(-0.15)], p<0.0001).
      CONCLUSIONS: FC reflects pediatric IBD severity and activity better than M2-PK.
      This difference is particularly pronounced when identifying patients with mild UC
      and UC in remission.

AB  - The chronic intestinal inflammation that characterises Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis arises from a complex interplay between host genotype, the
      immune system, and the intestinal microbiota. In addition, environmental factors 
      such as smoking impact on disease onset and progression. Individuals who smoke
      are more likely to develop Crohn's disease, and smoking is associated with
      recurrence after surgery and a poor response to medical therapy. Conversely,
      smoking appears protective against ulcerative colitis and smokers are less likely
      to require colectomy. The mechanism by which smoking exerts its impact on disease
      and the rational for the dichotomous effect in patients with Crohn's disease and 
      ulcerative colitis is not clear. Recent evidence suggests that smoking induces
      alterations to both the innate and acquired immune system. In addition, smoking
      is associated with a distinct alteration in the intestinal microbiota both in
      patients with active Crohn's disease and healthy subjects.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Seasonal and geographic variations of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) exacerbations have been described in adults, with inconsistent findings. We
      sought to determine whether disease activity in pediatric-onset IBD is associated
      with a seasonal pattern. METHODS: We examined children with Crohn disease (CD)
      and ulcerative colitis (UC) using data from the ImproveCareNow Collaborative
      between December 2008 and November 2010. We compared the proportion of patients
      in continuous remission for all recorded visits in each season. We also compared 
      the distribution of all recorded visits with a physician global assessment (PGA) 
      of remission or active disease across seasons. RESULTS: A total of 1325 patients 
      with CD (6102 visits) and 587 patients with UC (2394 visits) were included. The
      proportion of patients with UC in continuous remission during each season was
      highest in the summer (67%) and lowest in the winter (55%) (P=0.01). A similar
      pattern was found for CD but was not significant. Similarly, the proportion of
      visits in remission was highest in the summer and lowest in the winter for both
      UC (29%, 21%; P<0.001) and CD (28%, 23%; P<0.001); however, the distribution of
      visits with active disease was not significantly different across seasons.
      CONCLUSIONS: The higher proportion of patients with UC in continuous remission in
      the summer may be related to the higher proportion of remission visits in the
      summer, because the proportion of visits with active disease was similar across
      seasons. These findings do not support any strong associations between season of 
      the year and disease activity in pediatric IBD.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0090981 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Limited studies have examined the intestinal microbiota composition
      in relation to changes in disease course of IBD over time. We aimed to study
      prospectively the fecal microbiota in IBD patients developing an exacerbation
      during follow-up. DESIGN: Fecal samples from 10 Crohn's disease (CD) and 9
      ulcerative colitis (UC) patients during remission and subsequent exacerbation
      were included. Active disease was determined by colonoscopy and/or fecal
      calprotectine levels. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, antibiotic use, enema
      use and/or medication changes between consecutive samples. The microbial
      composition was assessed by 16S rDNA pyrosequencing. RESULTS: After quality
      control, 6,194-11,030 sequences per sample were available for analysis.
      Patient-specific shifts in bacterial composition and diversity were observed
      during exacerbation compared to remission, but overarching shifts within UC or CD
      were not observed. Changes in the bacterial community composition between
      remission and exacerbation as assessed by Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, were
      significantly larger in CD versus UC patients (0.59 vs. 0.42, respectively; p =
      0.025). Thiopurine use was found to be a significant cause of clustering as shown
      by Principal Coordinate Analysis and was associated with decreases in bacterial
      richness (Choa1 501.2 vs. 847.6 in non-users; p<0.001) and diversity (Shannon
      index: 5.13 vs. 6.78, respectively; p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Shifts in microbial
      composition in IBD patients with changing disease activity over time seem to be
      patient-specific, and are more pronounced in CD than in UC patients. Furthermore,
      thiopurine use was found to be associated with the microbial composition and
      diversity, and should be considered when studying the intestinal microbiota in
      relation to disease course.

TI  - Metalloproteinase-3 and -9 as novel markers in the evaluation of ulcerative
      colitis activity in children.
PG  - 103-10
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The enhanced activity of matrix endopeptidases (MMPs) involved in the
      degradation of connective tissue has been noted in tissue samples from the
      digestive tract in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), however sera concentrations 
      of MMPs, a potential tool for diagnostic tests in IBD patients, have not been
      established so far. The goal of the studies was to evaluate the concentrations of
      MMP-3 and MMP-9, in the sera of children suffering from ulcerative colitis (UC)
      in relation to disease activity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was comprised of
      31 children with UC (aged 3-18 years) and 37 children in the control group (aged 
      1-18 years). Disease activity was estimated using the Truelove-Witts scale. MMP-3
      and -9 concentrations were determined using ELISA tests. RESULTS: Median MMP-3
      concentrations were 18.4 ng/mL (95% CI: 12.5-24.3) for moderate and severe, 4.35 
      ng/mL (95% CI: 2.5-7.8) for the mild form of UC and 1.8 ng/mL (95% CI: 1.2-2.5)
      for the control group. Median MMP-9 concentrations were 18.0 ng/mL (95% CI:
      2.83-36.6) for moderate and severe, 1.55 ng/mL (95% CI: 0.4-3.0) for the mild
      form of UC and 1.3 ng/mL (95% CI: 0.7-1.96) for the control group. Serum MMP-3
      and MMP-9 concentrations in the moderate group were higher than those in the mild
      and control groups (p < 0.001). MMP-3 concentrations in the mild group also
      differed from those in the control group (p < 0.001). Among the parameters
      studied (MMP-3, MMP-9, CRP and ESR), MMP-3 had the highest discriminative value
      (AUC = 0.9, p < 0.001, sensitivity = 71%, specificity = 92%) in distinguishing
      patients with UC from healthy individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Elevation of MMP-3 and
      MMP-9 concentrations along with the disease activity suggests the possibility of 
      their application in the evaluation of the clinical activity of UC.

TI  - Development of a self-efficacy scale for adolescents and young adults with
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 29-32
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000357 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) self-management fits well 
      within a social-cognitive framework. At the heart of social-cognitive theory is
      self-efficacy, a set of beliefs about one's ability to perform certain tasks.
      Self-efficacy is a strong predictor of health outcomes in chronic diseases and
      could serve as an intermediary outcome measure of self-management for pediatric
      IBD. The aim of this preliminary study was to develop items for the design of a
      self-efficacy scale specifically for adolescents and young adults with IBD.
      METHODS: Survey development is an iterative process. As defined by the US Food
      and Drug Administration guidelines for developing a patient-reported outcome
      measurement, the first step of this process is to obtain patient input. Using
      qualitative research methods, adolescents and young adults were recruited from an
      outpatient pediatric gastroenterology clinic to participate in a semistructured
      interview. Transcriptions of the recorded interviews were reviewed for themes
      related to self-efficacy around disease management. A consensus panel of
      gastroenterologists and health psychologists reviewed the initially constructed
      items. Those specific items were then reviewed and adjusted by a panel of
      participants for content and understandability using cognitive interview methods.
      The resulting 13-item scale is presented here. RESULTS: Nineteen patients and 5
      parents participated in the study. The study sample was 42% girls, 79% whites,
      74% had Crohn disease, and 79% had not required surgery. Median age was 15 years 
      (range 10-22 years). Theme analysis and expert review yielded 13 items across 4
      theoretical domains: managing medical care, managing daily life with IBD,
      managing emotions, and managing the future with IBD. CONCLUSIONS: A 13-item
      disease-specific scale has been developed based on patient input to assess
      self-efficacy around self-management in adolescents with IBD. Efforts to validate
      this newly designed scale are presently under way.

TI  - Allopurinol: a useful adjunct to thiopurine therapy for pediatric ulcerative
      colitis in the biologic era.
PG  - 22-4
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000344 [doi]
AB  - Thiopurines are used as a maintenance therapy in patients with ulcerative colitis
      (UC). For some patients the metabolism of thiopurines is unfavorable, leading to 
      increased adverse effects, including hepatotoxicity. There are many reports in
      the adult literature concerning the manipulation of thiopurine metabolism with
      allopurinol; however, there is only 1 publication in this respect for pediatric
      UC. We present 3 pediatric cases of UC wherein the combination of allopurinol and
      low-dose 6-mercaptopurine allowed for shunting of thiopurine metabolites to a
      more favorable pattern. This intervention supported clinical remission in all,
      including one case poorly responsive to infliximab.

TI  - Colonic expression of the peptide transporter PEPT1 is downregulated during
      intestinal inflammation and is not required for NOD2-dependent immune activation.
PG  - 671-84
LID - 10.1097/01.MIB.0000443336.71488.08 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: PEPT1 was proposed to be expressed only in inflamed colonic tissues
      in which it could contribute to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) development by
      transporting bacterial peptides, such as muramyl dipeptide (MDP), that activate
      intracellular pattern recognition receptors, such as the nucleotide-binding and
      oligomerization domain 2. To better define the pathological relevance of this
      transporter, we analyzed PEPT1 expression during intestinal inflammation and
      studied the susceptibility of Pept1-deficient (Pept1) mice to experimental
      colitis. METHODS: Wild-type and Pept1 mice were treated with dextran sulfate
      sodium and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid to induce colitis, and MDP-induced
      cytokine expression was studied in colonic tissue cultures. PEPT1 expression was 
      characterized in mouse models of Crohn's disease-like ileitis (Tnf) or colitis
      (Il-10, Il-10XTlr2) and endoscopic tissue samples from descending colon of
      patients with IBD (n = 11) and controls (n = 17). Moreover, the prevalence of the
      PEPT1 single-nucleotide polymorphism rs2297322 was tested in German patients with
      IBD (n = 458) and controls (n = 452). RESULTS: PEPT1 expression was consistently 
      reduced under condition of acute or chronic experimental inflammation. Wild-type 
      and Pept1 mice revealed comparable susceptibility to dextran sulfate
      sodium-induced and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis, and
      MDP-induced cytokine expression was PEPT1-independent. PEPT1 expression levels
      were also decreased in descending colon of patients with IBD during acute
      inflammation, but the rs2297322 single-nucleotide polymorphism was not associated
      with IBD susceptibility in the German cohort. CONCLUSIONS: PEPT1 expression is
      reduced during intestinal inflammation and PEPT1 is neither required for
      MDP-induced immune response nor is the PEPT1 rs2297322 single-nucleotide
      polymorphism associated with IBD susceptibility in our German cohort. These data 
      strongly argue against a primary role of PEPT1 in the initiation or progression
      of IBD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early-onset (EO) pediatric inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) seem to 
      be more extensive than those with a later onset. To test this hypothesis, we
      examined the phenotype and disease course of patients with IBD diagnosis at 0 to 
      5 years, compared with the ranges 6 to 11 and 12 to 18 years. METHODS: Anatomic
      locations and behaviors were assessed according to Paris classification in 506
      consecutive patients: 224 Crohn's disease, 245 ulcerative colitis, and 37
      IBD-unclassified. RESULTS: Eleven percent of patients were in the range 0 to 5
      years, 39% in 6 to 11 years, and 50% in 12 to 18 years. Ulcerative colitis was
      the most frequent diagnosis in EO-IBD and in 6- to 11-year-old group, whereas
      Crohn's disease was predominant in older children. A classification as
      IBD-unclassified was more common in the range 0 to 5 years compared with the
      other groups (P < 0.005). EO Crohn's disease showed a more frequent isolated
      colonic (P < 0.005) and upper gastrointestinal involvement than later-onset
      disease. Sixty-two percent of the patients in the 0 to 5 years range had
      pancolonic ulcerative colitis, compared with 38% of 6 to 11 years (P = 0.02) and 
      31% of 12-18 years (P = 0.002) range. No statistical difference for family
      history for IBD was found in the 3-year age groups. Therapies at the diagnosis
      were similar for all children. However, at latest follow-up, a significantly
      higher proportion of younger children were under steroids compared with older
      groups (P < 0.05). Surgical risk did not differ according to age. CONCLUSIONS:
      EO-IBD exhibits an extensive phenotype and benefit from aggressive treatment
      strategies, although surgical risk is similar to later-onset disease. A family
      history for IBD is not common in EO disease.

TI  - Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 - a promising target in
      colitis-associated cancer.
PG  - 551-60
AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignancy and fourth most
      common cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Untreated chronic inflammation in the
      intestine ranks among the top three high-risk conditions for colitis-associated
      colorectal cancer (CAC). Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3
      (STAT3) protein is a member of the STAT family of transcription factors often
      deregulated in CRC. In this review, we try to emphasize the critical role of
      STAT3 in CAC as well as the crosstalk of STAT3 with inflammatory cytokines,
      nuclear factor (NF)- kappaB, PI3K/Akt, Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR),
      Notch, Wnt/beta-catenin and microRNA (MiR) pathways. STAT3 is considered as a
      primary drug target to treat CAC in humans and rodents. Also we updated the
      findings for inhibitors of STAT3 with regard to effeects on tumorigenesis. This
      review will hopefully provide insights on the use of STAT3 as a therapeutic
      target in CAC.

AB  - The evolving understanding of the role of the microbiome and environmental

      interesting and potentially powerful tool in the treatment of disease. However,
      at this time, evidence is limited but anecdotal reports of success abound. There 
      is a bewildering array of new diets being tried by patients in an attempt to
      control diseases. This review attempts to summarize the most common diets for the
      treating physician.

TI  - Restriction of dairy products; a reality in inflammatory bowel disease patients.
PG  - 575-81
LID - 10.3305/nh.2014.29.3.7124 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Calcium deficiency is considered a risk factor for the development 
      of osteoporosis in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Various dietary
      restrictions, including milk products are reported by these patients. OBJECTIVE: 
      To evaluate dairy product and dietary calcium intake by IBD patients. METHODS:
      This cross-sectional study enrolled 65 outpatients with IBD recruited from one
      reference center for IBD. A semi-structured questionnaire (to collect
      demographic, socioeconomic and clinical data) and a quantitative food frequency
      questionnaire were administered. With regard to clinical data, we evaluated the
      anthropometric nutritional status, the disease classification, the disease
      activity index and the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Self-reported
      modifications in the use of dairy products were evaluated. RESULTS: The IBD
      patients' ages ranged from 20-75 years and 67.0% were diagnosed with ulcerative
      colitis. The majority (64.7%) reported restricting dairy products. The frequency 
      of gastrointestinal symptoms was higher among the Crohn's disease patients who
      restricted dairy products than among those with no restrictions (100% vs 42.9%; p
      = 0.013); this result was not observed among the UC (ulcerative colitis)
      patients. Disease activity was also more frequent in the IBD patients who
      restricted dairy products than in those with no restrictions (23.8% vs 4.5%; p = 
      0.031), and among the UC patients, extensive disease was more common in the
      patients who restricted dairy products than in those with no restrictions (42.9% 
      vs 20.0%; p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Restricting dairy products is common among IBD
      patients, possibly due to disease activity, the presence of gastrointestinal
      symptoms and the extension of the disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The primary therapeutic goals in ulcerative colitis (UC) are to 
      maintain excellent quality of life (QOL) by treating flare-ups when they occur,
      and preventing flare-ups. Since stress can trigger UC flare-ups, we investigated 
      the efficacy of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) to reduce flare-ups and
      improve QOL. METHODS: Patients with moderately severe UC, in remission, were
      randomized to MBSR or time/attention control. Primary outcome was disease status.
      Secondary outcomes were changes in markers of inflammation and disease activity, 
      markers of stress and psychological assessments. RESULTS: 55 subjects were
      randomized. Absence of flares, time to flare and severity of flare over 1 year
      were similar between the two groups. However, post hoc analysis showed that MBSR 
      decreased the proportion of participants with at least one flare-up among those
      with top tertile urinary cortisol and baseline perceived stress (30 vs. 70%; p < 
      0.001). MBSR patients who flared demonstrated significantly lower stress at the
      last visit compared to flared patients in the control group (p = 0.04).
      Furthermore, MBSR prevented a drop in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Quality of
      Life Questionnaire during flare (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: MBSR did not affect the
      rate or severity of flare-ups in UC patients in remission. However, MBSR might be
      effective for those with high stress reactivity (high perceived stress and
      urinary cortisol) during remission. MBSR appears to improve QOL in UC patients by
      minimizing the negative impact of flare-ups on QOL. Further studies are needed to
      identify a subset of patients for whom MBSR could alter disease course.

      patients in intensive care units (ICUs). We reported CMV colitis which has rarely
      been recognized in the ICU patients. METHODS: CMV DNA was detected by polymerase 
      chain reaction (PCR) for blood and/or stool samples. Definite diagnosis of CMV
      colitis required histopathology or CMV immunohistochemical staining of colorectal
      biopsies. We reviewed ICU patients characterized by positive blood or stool
      CMV-PCR with colorectal bleeding or water diarrhea. RESULTS: We identified 18
      patients (biopsy-proved, n=8; probable cases, n=10). The most common
      comorbidities were chronic renal disease, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery 
      disease. Stool CMV-PCR was positive in 7 of 10 patients (2 of 3 biopsy-proved and
      5 of 7 probable cases). Colonoscopy was performed for 15 patients, revealing
      ulcerative or polypoid lesions. The endoscopists obtained colonic biopsies from 9
      patients. Yet, the pathologists reported CMV colitis for 4 patients. Additional 4
      patients were confirmed using immunohistochemical stain by the request of
      clinical physicians. Pseudomembranous colitis was found in 4 patients.
      CONCLUSION: Diagnosis of CMV colitis seems difficult in clinical practice and
      need persistent communication between clinicians. The positive stool CMV-PCR
      result was a useful hint for adding immunohistochemical stain in mucosal biopsies
      to make a definite diagnosis of CMV colitis.

AB  - The global prevalence of Fe deficiency is high and a common corrective strategy
      is oral Fe supplementation, which may affect the commensal gut microbiota and
      gastrointestinal health. The aim of the present study was to investigate the
      impact of different dietary Fe concentrations on the gut microbiota and gut
      health of rats inoculated with human faecal microbiota. Rats (8 weeks old, n 40) 
      were divided into five (n 8 each) groups and fed diets differing only in Fe
      concentration during an Fe-depletion period (12 weeks) and an Fe-repletion period
      (4 weeks) as follows: (1) Fe-sufficient diet throughout the study period; (2)
      Fe-sufficient diet followed by 70 mg Fe/kg diet; (3) Fe-depleted diet throughout 
      the study period; (4) Fe-depleted diet followed by 35 mg Fe/kg diet; (5)
      Fe-depleted diet followed by 70 mg Fe/kg diet. Faecal and caecal samples were
      analysed for gut microbiota composition (quantitative PCR and pyrosequencing) and
      bacterial metabolites (HPLC), and intestinal tissue samples were investigated
      histologically. Fe depletion did not significantly alter dominant populations of 
      the gut microbiota and did not induce Fe-deficiency anaemia in the studied rats. 
      Provision of the 35 mg Fe/kg diet after feeding an Fe-deficient diet
      significantly increased the abundance of dominant bacterial groups such as
      Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium cluster IV members compared with that of an
      Fe-deficient diet. Fe supplementation increased gut microbial butyrate
      concentration 6-fold compared with Fe depletion and did not affect histological
      colitis scores. The present results suggest that Fe supplementation enhances the 
      concentration of beneficial gut microbiota metabolites and thus may contribute to
      gut health.

TI  - Lactobacillus paracasei CBA L74 metabolic products and fermented milk for infant 
      formula have anti-inflammatory activity on dendritic cells in vitro and
      protective effects against colitis and an enteric pathogen in vivo.
PG  - e87615

AB  - The rapid expansion of commercially available fermented food products raises
      important safety issues particularly when infant food is concerned. In many
      cases, the activity of the microorganisms used for fermentation as well as what
      will be the immunological outcome of fermented food intake is not known. In this 
      manuscript we used complex in vitro, ex-vivo and in vivo systems to study the
      immunomodulatory properties of probiotic-fermented products (culture supernatant 
      and fermented milk without live bacteria to be used in infant formula). We found 
      in vitro and ex-vivo that fermented products of Lactobacillus paracasei CBA L74
      act via the inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine release leaving
      anti-inflammatory cytokines either unaffected or even increased in response to
      Salmonella typhimurium. These activities are not dependent on the inactivated
      bacteria but to metabolic products released during the fermentation process. We
      also show that our in vitro systems are predictive of an in vivo efficacy by the 
      fermented products. Indeed CBA L74 fermented products (both culture medium and
      fermented milk) could protect against colitis and against an enteric pathogen
      infection (Salmonella typhimurium). Hence we found that fermented products can
      act via the inhibition of immune cell inflammation and can protect the host from 
      pathobionts and enteric pathogens. These results open new perspectives in infant 
      nutrition and suggest that L. paracasei CBA L74 fermented formula can provide
      immune benefits to formula-fed infants, without carrying live bacteria that may
      be potentially dangerous to an immature infant immune system.

PG  - 614-21

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous investigations have produced mixed findings on whether youth
      with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) experience elevated rates of depressive
      symptoms. Our first aim was to compare self-report of depressive symptoms by
      youth with IBD with a community sample. The second aim was to examine the
      relationship between symptoms of depression and measures of disease activity.
      METHODS: Item-level responses on the Children's Depression Inventory among a
      sample of 78 youth diagnosed with IBD were compared with responses from a
      community sample using 1-sample t-tests. Particular attention was given to items 
      assessing somatic symptoms of depression given the potential overlap with IBD
      disease symptoms. The relationship between depressive symptoms and IBD disease
      activity was evaluated using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients and linear 
      regression. RESULTS: Youth with IBD reported lower levels of depressive symptoms 
      compared with the community sample on the Children's Depression Inventory Total
      Score, and similar or lower levels of difficulty on items assessing somatic
      symptoms. Most of the sample had inactive or mild disease activity at the time of
      participation, with 14% experiencing moderate/severe disease activity. Higher
      ratings of disease activity were related to greater depressive symptoms.
      Responses on somatic items from the Children's Depression Inventory were not
      differentially related to disease activity. CONCLUSIONS: As a group, pediatric
      patients with IBD did not experience the clinical levels of depressive symptoms
      or elevations in depressive symptoms when compared with a community sample.
      Somatic symptoms of depression do not differentiate youth with IBD experiencing
      elevations in disease activity from youth experiencing nonsomatic symptoms of
      depression.

AB  - Interleukin 10 (IL10) is a key anti-inflammatory cytokine that can inhibit
      proinflammatory responses of both innate and adaptive immune cells. An
      association between IL10 and intestinal mucosal homeostasis became clear with the
      discovery that IL10 and IL10 receptor (IL10R)-deficient mice develop spontaneous 
      intestinal inflammation. Similarly, patients with deleterious mutations in IL10, 
      IL10RA, or IL10RB present with severe enterocolitis within the first months of
      life. Here, we review recent findings on how IL10- and IL10R-dependent signaling 
      modulates innate and adaptive immune responses in the murine gastrointestinal
      tract, with implications of their role in the prevention of inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). In addition, we discuss the impact of IL10 and IL10R signaling
      defects in humans and their relationship to very early-onset IBD (VEO-IBD).

AB  - This study was conducted to investigate serum amino acids profile in dextran
      sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, and impacts of graded dose of arginine or
      glutamine supplementation on the colitis. Using DSS-induced colitis model, which 
      is similar to human ulcerative colitis, we determined serum profile of amino
      acids at day 3, 7, 10 and 12 (5 days post DSS treatment). Meanwhile, effects of
      graded dose of arginine (0.4%, 0.8%, and 1.5%) or glutamine (0.5%, 1.0% and 2.0%)
      supplementation on clinical parameters, serum amino acids, colonic tight junction
      proteins, colonic anti-oxidative indicators [catalase, total superoxide dismutase
      (T-SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px)], colonic pro-inflammatory cytokines
      [interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, IL-17 and tumor necrosis factor alpha
      (TNF-alpha)] in DSS-induced colitis were fully analyzed at day 7 and 12.
      Additionally, the activation of signal transduction pathways, including nuclear
      factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK),
      phosphoinositide-3-kinases (PI3K)/PI3K-protein kinase B (Akt), and myosin light
      chain kinase (MLCK)-myosin light chain (MLC20), were analyzed using
      immunoblotting. Serum amino acids analysis showed that DSS treatment changed the 
      serum contents of amino acids, such as Trp, Glu, and Gln (P<0.05). Dietary
      arginine or glutamine supplementation had significant (P<0.05) influence on the
      clinical and biochemical parameters (T-SOD, IL-17 and TNF-alpha) in colitis
      model. These results were associated with colonic NF-kappaB, PI3K-Akt and MLCK
      signaling pathways. In conclusion, arginine or glutamine could be a potential
      therapy for intestinal inflammatory diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Fatigue is one of the top complaints of people with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however this is often not addressed in clinical
      consultations. This study aimed to gain an understanding of healthcare
      practitioners' (HCPs) perception of IBD fatigue as experienced by people with
      IBD. METHODS: Descriptive phenomenology was conducted with 20 HCPs who work with 
      people with IBD. In-depth semi-structured interviews were audio recorded and
      transcribed verbatim. Colazzi's framework was used to analyse data. RESULTS:
      Three themes and several sub-themes were identified. The main themes were: the
      phenomenon of fatigue as perceived by HCPs; the impact of fatigue on patients'
      lives; and the methods used by HCPs to deal with fatigue. Fatigue was identified 
      as an important, but difficult and frustrating, symptom to understand. HCPs
      reported that fatigue impacts on the emotional, private and public aspects of
      patients' functioning, however there were few methods suggested on how to assess 
      and manage the fatigue. Many expressed frustration at not being able to help
      more. CONCLUSIONS: The study identified a gap in HCPs' knowledge and their
      understanding of the complexity of IBD fatigue and the full impact that IBD
      fatigue has on people's lives. There is a need for more research-generated
      evidence to enhance our understanding of the concept and the factors associated
      with IBD fatigue. Advances in the assessment and management of this complicated
      and poorly understood clinical symptom are needed in order to help enable HCPs to
      provide better quality care to people affected by IBD and IBD fatigue.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the influenza vaccination status among
      paediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Poland. This was a
      questionnaire-based study. 242 patients with IBD and 142 controls were enrolled
      in the study. Of patients with IBD, 7.8% received an influenza vaccine, compared 
      to 18.3% of controls (P = 0.0013). There were no statistically significant
      differences in time from IBD diagnosis, disease activity and in drugs, between
      vaccinated and non-vaccinated IBD children. In conclusion, the data of our study 
      demonstrate an alarmingly poor influenza vaccination status in the majority of
      children with IBD. Therefore, there is an unmet need to implement better
      influenza vaccination strategies for this group of patients.

      gastrointestinal bleeding. We present recommendations for the prevention and
      treatment of VTE in patients with IBD. METHODS: A systematic literature search
      was performed to identify studies on VTE in IBD. The quality of evidence and
      strength of recommendations were rated according to the Grading of Recommendation
      Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Statements were
      developed through an iterative online platform, then finalized and voted on by a 
      working group of adult and pediatric gastroenterologists and thrombosis
      specialists. RESULTS: IBD patients have an approximately 3-fold higher risk of
      VTE compared with individuals without IBD, and disease flares further increase
      this risk. Anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis is recommended for IBD patients who
      are hospitalized with IBD flares without active bleeding and is suggested when
      bleeding is nonsevere. Anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis is suggested during
      moderate-severe IBD flares in outpatients with a history of VTE provoked by an
      IBD flare or an unprovoked VTE, but not otherwise. The recommended duration of
      anticoagulation after a first VTE is based on the presence of provoking factors. 
      Specific suggestions are made for the prevention and treatment of VTE in
      pediatric and pregnant IBD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Using the American College of
      Chest Physicians' guidelines as a foundation, we have integrated evidence from
      IBD studies to develop specific recommendations for the management of VTE in this
      high-risk population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dietary fiber may favorably influence fermentation, gastrointestinal 
      inflammation, and disease progression in Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis
      (UC), and pouchitis and offer an attractive therapeutic addition to
      pharmacological treatment. This systematic review appraised data from randomized 
      controlled trials of fiber in the management of inflammatory bowel disease.
      METHODS: The review followed Cochrane and PRISMA recommendations. Seven
      electronic databases were searched along with hand searching and contacting
      experts. Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials of the effects of
      fiber on clinical endpoints (primarily disease activity for treatment or
      maintenance) or physiological outcomes in patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease. RESULTS: In total, 23 randomized controlled trials fulfilled the
      inclusion criteria (UC, 10; Crohn's disease, 12; and pouchitis, 1) recruiting
      1296 patients. In UC, 3/10 studies reported fiber supplementation to benefit
      disease outcomes. In Crohn's disease, 0/12 studies and in pouchitis 1/1 study
      reported a benefit on disease activity. Despite this, a number of studies
      reported favorable intragroup effects on physiological outcomes including fecal
      butyrate, fecal calprotectin, inflammatory cytokines, microbiota, and
      gastrointestinal symptom indices. Meta-analysis was not possible. CONCLUSIONS:
      There is limited weak evidence for the efficacy of fiber in improving disease
      outcomes in UC and pouchitis. The potential antiinflammatory role of fiber is
      intriguing and merits further investigation in adequately powered clinical
      trials. Excluding overt gastrointestinal obstruction, there was no evidence that 
      fiber intake should be restricted in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

      extract: a randomized controlled trial.

AB  - Curcumin is a phytocompound found in the root of turmeric, a common herbal
      ingredient in many Asian cuisines. The compound contains anti-inflammatory
      activity, which is mediated through an up-regulation of adiponectin and reduction
      of leptin. Consumption of curcumin was shown to prevent some deteriorative
      conditions caused by inflammation, such as ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid
      arthritis and esophagitis, and so on. Inflammation-associated cardiovascular
      conditions such as atherosclerosis are common in diabetes patients. The
      anti-inflammation effect of curcumin might be beneficial to prevent such
      condition in these patients. We aim to evaluate an antiatherosclerosis effect of 
      curcumin in diabetes patients. Effects of curcumin on risk factors for
      atherosclerosis were investigated in a 6-month randomized, double-blinded and
      placebo-controlled clinical trial that included subjects diagnosed with type 2
      diabetes. An atherosclerosis parameter, the pulse wave velocity, and other
      metabolic parameters in patients treated with placebo and curcumin were compared.
      Our results showed that curcumin intervention significantly reduced pulse wave
      velocity, increased level of serum adiponectin and decreased level of leptin.
      These results are associated with reduced levels of homeostasis model
      assessment-insulin resistance, triglyceride, uric acid, visceral fat and total
      body fat. In summary, a 6-month curcumin intervention in type 2 diabetic
      population lowered the atherogenic risks. In addition, the extract helped to
      improve relevant metabolic profiles in this high-risk population.

TI  - Detailed assessment of nutritional status and eating patterns in children with

      healthy controls.
PG  - 700-6
LID - 10.1038/ejcn.2013.286 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: In the era of modern multidisciplinary clinical
      management, very little is known about the prevalence and presentation of
      malnutrition in children with gastrointestinal disorders (GastroD) particularly
      employing composite, global measures of nutritional status. SUBJECTS/METHODS:
      Anthropometry, body composition, dietary intake, eating habits and grip strength 
      were assessed with bedside methods in 168 patients from outpatient
      gastroenterology clinics (n, median (IQR) years; Crohn's disease (CD): n=53, 14.2
      (11.6:15.4); ulcerative colitis (UC): n=27, 12.2 (10.7:14.2); coeliac disease:
      n=31, 9.3 (7.5:13.6); other GastroD: n=57, 9.8 (7.2:13.8)) and compared with 62
      contemporary healthy controls (n, median (IQR): 9.8 (6.9:13.8)) and the results
      of the recent UK, National Diet and Nutritional Survey (NDNS). RESULTS: Children 
      with CD had lower BMI z-scores than controls (median (IQR): -0.3 (-0.9:0.4) vs
      0.3 (-0.6:1.4); P=0.02) but only 2% were classified as thin (BMI z-score <-2
      s.d.). The prevalence of obesity in children with UC was 19%, 6% in CD, 11% in
      children with other GastroD and 15% in controls. No difference was found in grip 
      strength measurement between groups. Except for CD children, the proportion of
      patients with suboptimal micronutrient intake was similar to that of controls and
      the cohort of children from the latest NDNS. A higher proportion of children with
      CD had suboptimal intake for riboflavin, vitamin B6 and calcium and consumed
      significantly more meat products, juices (including carbonated drinks),
      spreads/jams and crisps and savoury snacks and significantly fewer portions of
      dairy, fish, fruits and vegetables compared with healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS:
      GastroD affect children's body composition, growth, strength, dietary intake and 
      eating habits, particularly CD, but to a lesser extent than expected.

AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) is characterized by chronic inflammation of the colonic
      mucosa. Administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to animals is a frequently
      used model to mimic human colitis. Deregulation of the immune response to the
      enteric microflora or pathogens as well as increased intestinal permeability have
      been proposed as disease-driving mechanisms. To enlarge the understanding of the 
      pathogenesis, we have studied the effect of DSS on the immune system and gut
      microbiota in mice. Intestinal inflammation was verified through histological
      evaluation and myeloperoxidase activity. Immunological changes were assessed by
      flow cytometry in spleen, Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes and through 
      multiplex cytokine profiling. In addition, quantification of the total amount of 
      bacteria on colonic mucosa as well as the total amount of lactobacilli,
      Akkermansia, Desulfovibrio and Enterobacteriaceae was performed by the use of
      quantitative PCR. Diversity and community structure were analysed by terminal
      restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) patterns, and principal
      component analysis was utilized on immunological and T-RFLP patterns. DSS-induced
      colitis show clinical and histological similarities to UC. The composition of the
      colonic microflora was profoundly changed and correlated with several alterations
      of the immune system. The results demonstrate a relationship between multiple
      immunological changes and alterations of the gut microbiota after DSS
      administration. These data highlight and improve the definition of the
      immunological basis of the disease and suggest a role for dysregulation of the
      gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of colitis.

TI  - ErbB receptors and their growth factor ligands in pediatric intestinal
      inflammation.
PG  - 127-32
LID - 10.1038/pr.2013.210 [doi]
AB  - The ErbB tyrosine kinases (epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), ErbB2/HER2,
      ErbB3, and ErbB4) are cell surface growth factor receptors widely expressed in
      many developing mammalian tissues, including in the intestinal tract. Signaling
      elicited by these receptors promotes epithelial cell growth and survival, and
      ErbB ligands have been proposed as therapeutic agents for intestinal diseases of 
      pediatric populations, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), necrotizing
      enterocolitis (NEC), and inflammation associated with total parenteral nutrition 
      (TPN). Furthermore, emerging evidence points to reduced ErbB ligand expression
      and thus reduced ErbB activity in IBD, NEC, and TPN models. This review will
      discuss the current understanding of the role of ErbB receptors in the
      pathogenesis and potential treatment of pediatric intestinal inflammation, with
      focus on the altered signaling in disease and the molecular mechanisms by which
      exogenous ligands are protective.

TI  - Protein tyrosine phosphatase sigma targets apical junction complex proteins in
      the intestine and regulates epithelial permeability.
PG  - 693-8
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1315017111 [doi]
AB  - Protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP)sigma (PTPRS) was shown previously to be
      associated with susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). PTPsigma(-/-)
      mice exhibit an IBD-like phenotype in the intestine and show increased
      susceptibility to acute models of murine colitis. However, the function of
      PTPsigma in the intestine is uncharacterized. Here, we show an intestinal
      epithelial barrier defect in the PTPsigma(-/-) mouse, demonstrated by a decrease 
      in transepithelial resistance and a leaky intestinal epithelium that was
      determined by in vivo tracer analysis. Increased tyrosine phosphorylation was
      observed at the plasma membrane of epithelial cells lining the crypts of the
      small bowel and colon of the PTPsigma(-/-) mouse, suggesting the presence of
      PTPsigma substrates in these regions. Using mass spectrometry, we identified
      several putative PTPsigma intestinal substrates that were
      hyper-tyrosine-phosphorylated in the PTPsigma(-/-) mice relative to wild type.
      Among these were proteins that form or regulate the apical junction complex,
      including ezrin. We show that ezrin binds to and is dephosphorylated by PTPsigma 
      in vitro, suggesting it is a direct PTPsigma substrate, and identified
      ezrin-Y353/Y145 as important sites targeted by PTPsigma. Moreover, subcellular
      localization of the ezrin phosphomimetic Y353E or Y145 mutants were disrupted in 
      colonic Caco-2 cells, similar to ezrin mislocalization in the colon of
      PTPsigma(-/-) mice following induction of colitis. Our results suggest that
      PTPsigma is a positive regulator of intestinal epithelial barrier, which mediates
      its effects by modulating epithelial cell adhesion through targeting of apical
      junction complex-associated proteins (including ezrin), a process impaired in
      IBD.

TI  - Malignancy and mortality in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a
      multinational study from the porto pediatric IBD group.
PG  - 291-300
LID - 10.1097/01.MIB.0000439066.69340.3c [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The combination of the severity of pediatric-onset inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) phenotypes and the need for intense medical treatment may increase 
      the risk of malignancy and mortality, but evidence regarding the extent of the
      problem is scarce. Therefore, the Porto Pediatric IBD working group of ESPGHAN
      conducted a multinational-based survey of cancer and mortality in pediatric IBD. 
      METHODS: A survey among pediatric gastroenterologists of 20 European countries
      and Israel on cancer and/or mortality in the pediatric patient population with
      IBD was undertaken. One representative from each country repeatedly contacted all
      pediatric gastroenterologists from each country for reporting retrospectively
      cancer and/or mortality of pediatric patients with IBD after IBD onset, during
      2006-2011. RESULTS: We identified 18 cases of cancers and/or 31 deaths in 44
      children (26 males) who were diagnosed with IBD (ulcerative colitis, n = 21) at a
      median age of 10.0 years (inter quartile range, 3.0-14.0). Causes of mortality
      were infectious (n = 14), cancer (n = 5), uncontrolled disease activity of IBD (n
      = 4), procedure-related (n = 3), other non-IBD related diseases (n = 3), and
      unknown (n = 2). The most common malignancies were hematopoietic tumors (n = 11),
      of which 3 were hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma and 3 Ebstein-Barr virus-associated
      lymphomas. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer and mortality in pediatric IBD are rare, but
      cumulative rates are not insignificant. Mortality is primarily related to
      infections, particularly in patients with 2 or more immunosuppressive agents,
      followed by cancer and uncontrolled disease. At least 6 lymphomas were likely
      treatment-associated by virtue of their phenotype.

TI  - Effect of zinc supplementation on superoxide dismutase activity in patients with 
      ulcerative rectocolitis.
PG  - 1434-7
LID - 10.3305/nh.2015.31.3.8402 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ulcerative rectocolitis is characterized by diffuse mucosal
      inflammation and oxidative stress. Thus, the organism activates the antioxidant
      defence system in an attempt to reduce the excessive production of reactive
      oxygen species or neutralize them. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the effect of 
      zinc supplementation on the activity of the enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) in 
      patients with ulcerative rectocolitis. METHODS: The study included 24 patients,
      aged between 20 and 59 years and diagnosed with ulcerative rectocolitis, in the
      remission stage of the disease, who were divided into two groups: experimental - 
      deficient in zinc (n=12) and control - normal or high zinc (n=12). Only the first
      group underwent supplement intervention, in the form of zinc gluconate (30 mg
      Zn/day), taken daily in the morning, fasted for 60 days. Plasma and erythrocyte
      zinc concentrations were determined by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer.
      The erythrocyte SOD activity was determined in vitro according to the methodology
      recommended by the manufacturer Randox. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Zinc
      supplementation caused a significant increase in the plasma concentrations of the
      mineral, and showed a significant reduction in erythrocyte zinc, remaining within
      normal limits. The SOD activity was high in patients of both the experimental and
      control groups, with no difference after supplementation. CONCLUSION: This study 
      demonstrates that zinc supplementation improves the homeostatic condition of the 
      mineral, with no change in SOD activity, as a marker of oxidative stress in
      patients with ulcerative rectocolitis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The phenolic compounds present in olive leaves (Olea europaea L.)
      confer benefits to the human health. OBJECTIVES: To review the scientific
      literature about the benefits of the polyphenols of olive leaves to human health.
      METHOD: Literature review in the LILACS-BIREME, SciELO and MEDLINE databases for 
      publications in English, Portuguese and Spanish with the descriptors "Olea
      europaea", "olive leaves", "olive leaf", "olive leaves extracts", "olive leaf
      extracts", "phenolic compounds", "polyphenols", "oleuropein", "chemical
      composition", and "health". There were identified 92 articles, but only 38
      related to the objectives of the study and 9 articles cited in the works were
      included due to their relevance. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The phenolic compounds
      present in olive leaves, especially the oleuropein, are associated to
      antioxidant, antihypertensive, hypoglycemic, hypocholesterolemic and
      cardioprotective activity. Furthermore, studies associate the oleuropein to an
      anti-inflammatory effect in trauma of the bone marrow and as a support in the
      treatment of obesity.

TI  - The role of total parenteral nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease: current
      aspects.
PG  - 3-14
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2013.860557 [doi]
AB  - Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) represents a therapeutic modality that could
      save the life of a patient with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) facing severe
      nutritional problems, by restoring the patient's impaired nutritional status. TPN
      does not compete with enteral nutrition (EN), the latter being the first choice
      for all patients having anatomically intact and functionally normal digestive
      tract. TPN allows bowel rest while supplying adequate calorific intake and
      essential nutrients, and removes antigenic mucosal stimuli. The value of TPN in
      malnourished patients with intestinal failure due to CD is beyond doubt. However,
      it is difficult to suggest TPN as a sole treatment for active CD. An increased
      rate of remission could not be expected by applying TPN. The utility of TPN is
      restricted to certain cases involving efforts to close enterocutaneous or other
      complicated fistulas in patients with fistulizing CD, the treatment of short
      bowel syndrome following extensive resections for CD, or when EN is impractical
      for other reasons. There are no advantages of TPN therapy over EN therapy
      regarding fistula healing. TPN has no influence on the surgical intervention rate
      and little benefit by bypassing the intestinal passage could be expected. Also
      TPN shows no advantage if the disease is chronically active. However, an optimal 
      supply of nutrients improves bowel motility, intestinal permeability and
      nutritional status, and reduces inflammatory reactions. TPN might be associated
      with an increased risk of adverse events, although TPN undertaken by experienced 
      teams does not cause more complications than does EN.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) frequently manifests during
      childhood and adolescence. For providing and understanding a comprehensive
      picture of a patients' health status, health-related quality of life (HRQoL)
      instruments are an essential complement to clinical symptoms and functional
      limitations. Currently, the IMPACT-III questionnaire is one of the most
      frequently used disease-specific HRQoL instrument among patients with IBD.
      However, there is a lack of studies examining the validation and reliability of
      this instrument. METHODS: 146 paediatric IBD patients from the multicenter Swiss 
      IBD paediatric cohort study database were included in the study. Medical and
      laboratory data were extracted from the hospital records. HRQoL data were
      assessed by means of standardized questionnaires filled out by the patients in a 
      face-to-face interview. RESULTS: The original six IMPACT-III domain scales could 
      not be replicated in the current sample. A principal component analysis with the 
      extraction of four factor scores revealed the most robust solution. The four
      factors indicated good internal reliability (Cronbach's alpha=.64-.86), good
      concurrent validity measured by correlations with the generic KIDSCREEN-27 scales
      and excellent discriminant validity for the dimension of physical functioning
      measured by HRQoL differences for active and inactive severity groups (p<.001,
      d=1.04). CONCLUSIONS: This study with Swiss children with IBD indicates good
      validity and reliability for the IMPACT-III questionnaire. However, our findings 
      suggest a slightly different factor structure than originally proposed. The
      IMPACT-III questionnaire can be recommended for its use in clinical practice. The
      factor structure should be further examined in other samples.

      may explain skeletal muscle loss in Crohn's disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: In Crohn's disease (CD), skeletal muscle mass and function are
      reduced compared to healthy controls, potentially resulting in disability.
      Mechanisms contributing to muscle impairment, and thus potential therapeutic
      targets, are poorly understood. This study aimed to measure and compare skeletal 
      muscle size and molecular targets involved in skeletal muscle growth, in CD
      subjects and healthy controls. METHODS: CD (n=27) and healthy (n=22) subjects
      were recruited from the IBD outpatient clinic and via local advertisement
      respectively. Demographics and clinical data were collected via survey and
      interview. Quadriceps muscle cross-sectional area was measured using peripheral
      quantitative CT scanning. Levels of muscle hypertrophy and atrophy signalling
      targets using quantitative PCR and western blotting were measured in muscle
      biopsies. RESULTS: Muscle size was 14% lower (p=0.055) and a 54% lower
      phosphorylated:total (p:t) Akt ratio was measured in the muscle samples (p<0.05),
      indicating an attenuated muscle hypertrophy pathway in CD compared with controls.
      In those with CD, a lower p:t Akt ratio (<0.97) was associated with lower serum
      vitamin D3, lower physical activity indices (49 vs 64 mmol/L, 1.7 vs 2.2x10(6)
      accelerometer counts respectively, each p<0.05) and a trend towards lower serum
      ferritin levels (128 vs 322mg/L, p=0.07), compared with CD subjects with
      normal/high p:t Akt ratios. CONCLUSION: The reduced muscle mass in CD may be
      explained, in part, by impaired activation of muscle protein synthesis pathways, 
      notably the IGF1-Akt pathway. Normal vitamin D levels and regular exercise may be
      protective in CD against this trend, though confirmatory longitudinal studies are
      needed.

AB  - An association between multiple sclerosis (MS) and inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) has been suggested. The purpose of this study was to compare the disease
      course of patients with both MS and IBD with that of patients with isolated MS or
      isolated IBD. Sixty-six MS-IBD patients were identified and were matched with 251
      isolated MS and 257 isolated IBD controls. Main outcomes were scores using the
      Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) in MS and extent of disease extension in 
      IBD at last clinical evaluation. After a median 12 years of disease duration, the
      median EDSS and the percentages of patients reaching an EDSS of 3.0 and 4.0 were 
      significantly lower in MS-IBD patients than in controls. MS had no impact on IBD.
      MS course appears to be milder in patients with concomitant IBD.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Fatigue, weakness and musculoskeletal manifestations are
      associated with IBD. An impaired nutritional status and a reduced physical
      activity can contribute to these clinical outcomes, impacting quality of life and
      increasing disability. This study aims to assess muscle strength and lower limb
      physical performance in female UC patients, taking into consideration disease
      activity, body composition and habitual physical activity. METHODS: A
      case-control study was performed including 23 UC female outpatients and 23 age-
      and BMI-matched healthy women as controls. Quadriceps strength (QS), handgrip
      strength (HGS), physical performance based measures (five repetitions sit-up test
      and 4meter gait speed test), body composition (bioelectrical impedance analysis, 
      anthropometry), and habitual physical activity (HPA) levels were assessed.
      RESULTS: UC group had decreased QS (-6%; P=0.012), slower sit-up test (-32%;
      P=0.000), slower gait speed (-17% P=0.002) and decreased HPA level (-30%,
      P=0.001) compared with controls. No difference in HGS was observed between
      groups. Logistic regression showed that UC was an independent factor for
      decreased QS and slower sit-up test, while HPA was a protective factor for
      impaired gait speed. Multivariate linear regression showed that BMI was
      independently associated with an improved QS and slower sit-up test in the UC
      group. CONCLUSION: Women with UC had decreased lower limb strength and mobility
      limitations, which were associated with BMI and the level of physical activity.
      Early evaluation of nutritional status and performance of the lower limbs could
      identify UC patients with pre-clinical disability who may benefit from earlier
      health lifestyle modifications.

TI  - Rescue therapy with cyclosporine or infliximab is not associated with an
      increased risk for postoperative complications in patients hospitalized for
      severe steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 14-20
LID - 10.1097/01.MIB.0000437497.07181.05 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cyclosporine and infliximab (IFX) are effective medical therapies for
      inducing remission in patients with steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis (UC).
      Patients with acute severe disease who do not respond to these therapies require 
      colectomy, however, the risk of postoperative complications in such patients is
      not known. Analyzing patients with acute severe UC, we compared the incidence of 
      postoperative complications in patients who failed rescue therapy with
      cyclosporine or IFX with that in patients who received intravenous (IV)
      corticosteroids alone. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of UC
      patients who underwent colectomy after inpatient treatment with cyclosporine plus
      IV corticosteroids (CsA+IVS), infliximab plus IV corticosteroids (IFX+IVS), or IV
      corticosteroids alone (IVS) at the University of Chicago Hospitals from October
      1, 2006 to October 1, 2012. Primary endpoints were infectious, noninfectious, and
      total complications occurring within 30 days of colectomy. RESULTS: Of 78
      patients, 19 were treated with CsA+IVS, 24 with IFX+IVS, 4 with both CsA and
      IFX+IVS, and 31 with IVS alone. Patients treated with rescue therapy plus IVS had
      no difference in total postoperative complications compared with those receiving 
      IVS alone (CsA+IVS: relative risk (RR) = 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI),
      0.33-1.23; IFX+IVS: RR = 0.65, 95% CI, 0.36-1.17). There remained no difference
      in postoperative complications between the rescue therapy and IVS alone groups
      when subcategorizing overall complications into infectious (CsA+IVS: RR = 0.54,
      95% CI, 0.17-1.76; IFX+IVS: RR = 0.86, 95% CI, 0.36-2.09) and noninfectious
      (CsA+IVS: RR = 0.88, 95% CI, 0.43-1.80; IFX+IVS: RR = 0.40, 95% CI, 0.15-1.07)
      causes. CONCLUSIONS: Cyclosporine and IFX are not associated with an increased
      risk for postoperative complications in patients hospitalized for severe UC
      refractory to corticosteroids.

TI  - Polymorphisms in the sodium-dependent ascorbate transporter gene SLC23A1 are
      associated with susceptibility to Crohn disease.
PG  - 378-83
LID - 10.3945/ajcn.113.068015 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are 2 common
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) associated with intestinal inflammation and
      tissue damage. Oxidative stress is suggested to play a major role in the
      initiation and progression of IBD. Vitamin C (ascorbate, ascorbic acid)
      supplementation has reduced oxidative stress in persons with IBD. The role of
      ascorbate transporters in IBD remains to be determined. SLC23A1 is a major
      ascorbate transporter in the intestinal tract, and some of its genetic variants
      have been associated with severely decreased ascorbate transport and lower
      systemic concentrations. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether common 
      genetic variants in the vitamin C transporter SLC23A1 are associated with the
      risk of IBD. DESIGN: Genomic DNA samples from patients with CD (n = 162) and UC
      (n = 149) from the Manitoba IBD Cohort Study and ethnically matched controls (n =
      142) were genotyped for 3 SLC23A1 polymorphisms (rs6596473, rs33972313, and
      rs10063949) by using TaqMan assays. RESULTS: Variation at rs10063949 (G allele
      for heterozygote and homozygote) was associated with increased susceptibility to 
      CD (OR: 2.54; 95% CI: 1.38, 4.66; OR: 4.72; 95% CI: 2.53, 8.81; P < 0.0001;
      respectively). A strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) was observed across the
      SLC23A1 region (variation rs6596473 with rs10063949) for CD and UC (D' = 0.94 and
      0.96, respectively). The risk alleles confirmed a haplotype (CGG) that is carried
      more in CD patients (65.3%, P < 0.0001) than in controls (43.5%). CONCLUSIONS: A 
      genetic variant (rs10063949-G) in the SLC23A1 ascorbate transporter locus was
      identified and is associated with an increased risk of CD in a white Canadian IBD
      cohort. The presented evidence that SLC23A1 variations can modulate the risk of
      CD has implications for understanding ascorbate transport in CD patients and
      provides a novel opportunity toward individualized nutritional therapy for
      patients carrying the disease-associated genotype.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Telephone communication is common between healthcare providers
      and patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We analyzed telephone
      activity at an IBD care center to identify disease and patient characteristics
      associated with high levels of telephone activity and determine if call volume
      could identify individuals at risk for future visits to the emergency department 
      (ED) or hospitalization. METHODS: We performed a prospective observational study 
      in which we categorized telephone calls received by nursing staff over 2 years at
      a tertiary care IBD clinic (2475 patients in 2009 and 3118 in 2010). We analyzed 
      data on 21,979 ingoing and outgoing calls in 2009 and 32,667 calls in 2010 and
      assessed associations between clinical factors and logged telephone encounters,
      and between patterns of telephone encounters and future visits to the ED or
      hospitalization. RESULTS: Telephone encounters occurred twice as frequently as
      office visits; 15% of the patients generated >10 telephone encounters per year
      and were responsible for half of all telephone encounters. A higher percentage of
      these high telephone encounter (HTE) patients were female, had Crohn's disease,
      received steroid treatment, had increased levels of C-reactive protein and rates 
      of erythrocyte sedimentation, had psychiatric comorbidities, and had chronic
      abdominal pain than patients with lower telephone encounters. The HTE patients
      were also more frequently seen in the ED or hospitalized over the same time
      period and in subsequent years. Forty-two percent of patients with >8 telephone
      encounters within 30 days were seen in the ED or hospitalized within the
      subsequent 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Based on an analysis of telephone records at
      an IBD clinic, 15% of patients account for half of all calls. These HTE patients 
      are a heterogeneous group with refractory disease who are likely to visit the ED 
      or be hospitalized.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease with
      increasing incidence in children. Current medications have potentially serious
      side effects, hence increasing interest in alternative therapies. We previously
      developed an herbal formula, FAHF-2, based on a classical traditional Chinese
      herbal formula Wu Mei Wan that has long been used in China to treat colitis. We
      investigated FAHF-2's potential anti-inflammatory effects. METHODS: FAHF-2
      efficacy was tested in vivo in the CD45RbRAG1 transfer colitis model. Weight
      loss, colonic histology, and cytokine production from mesenteric lymph nodes were
      assessed. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and colonic biopsies
      were obtained from children newly diagnosed with CD and controls and cultured
      with or without FAHF-2. Cytokine levels were measured by multiplex immunoassay.
      The effect of FAHF-2 on TNF-alpha-producing cells was determined by flow
      cytometry. NF-kappaB signaling was investigated in human lamina propria
      mononuclear cells upon FAHF-2 treatment by In-Cell Western. RESULTS:
      FAHF-2-treated mice had decreased weight loss, improved histology, and reduced
      TNF-alpha, IL-17, IL-6, and IFN-gamma production. In vitro treated PBMCs produced
      less TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and IL-12. FAHF-2 reduced the TNF-alpha-producing
      monocytes and T cells. Inflamed CD biopsies produced less TNF-alpha, IL-17, IL-6,
      and IL-1beta. These effects are because of decreased NF-kappaB activation.
      CONCLUSIONS: FAHF-2 inhibited both adaptive and innate immune proinflammatory
      cytokine responses in PBMCs and inflamed CD mucosa due in part to blockage of
      NF-kappaB activation. FAHF-2 was effective in halting progression of colitis in a
      murine model. This study shows that FAHF-2 has potential as a novel treatment of 
      CD.

TI  - Melatonin, autophagy and intestinal bowel disease.
PG  - 4816-27
AB  - The intestinal epithelium forms a barrier against the intestinal contents and the
      wider environment, allowing entry of selected molecules for nutrition and
      programming of the mucosal immune system, but excluding toxins and most
      microorganisms. Many receptors and signalling pathways are coupled and implicated
      in the epithelial control and significant advances have been achieved in the
      understanding of the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and in the 
      introduction of biologics. However, not all of the patients respond and many lose
      their response. Data from experimental studies have documented that the pineal
      secretory product melatonin exerts important inmunoregulatory and
      antiinflammatory effects in different models of colitis. These actions have been 
      associated to a variety of mechanisms, such as reduction of T cells number,
      modulation of macrophage activity, suppression of NFkappaB activity, inhibition
      of cell adhesion molecules and proinflammatory cytokines , suppression of COX-2
      and iNOS levels and the consequent synthesis of PGE2 and NO, reduction of matrix 
      metalloproteinase (MMP) -2 and -9 activity, and modulation of apoptosis. In
      addition, the beneficial effects of melatonin in IBD are related to its scavenger
      effect on free radicals and the activation of several antioxidant enzymes.
      However, only a small number of human studies report possible beneficial and also
      possible harmful effects of melatonin in case reports and clinical trials. There 
      is a considerable bulk of information supporting the connection between autophagy
      and human diseases, including IBD, and although autophagy is actually considered 
      more a pro-survival than a pro-death pathway, these two features of its action
      are relevant in human diseases, having therapeutic potential for both activators 
      and inhibitors of autophagy. Some of the opposite effects than have been reported
      for melatonin in IBD could be related to the duality of its effects on autophagy,
      which itself can be beneficial or detrimental. In this review, new data for
      melatonin in IBD are discussed, trying to provide recent information of different
      molecular mechanism including the role of the autophagy regulation.

TI  - High residential sun exposure is associated with a low risk of incident Crohn's
      disease in the prospective E3N cohort.
PG  - 75-81
LID - 10.1097/01.MIB.0000436275.12131.4f [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin D insufficiency has been suggested to be associated with high
      risk of Crohn's disease (CD). In France, where food fortification is limited, the
      major source of vitamin D is through sun exposure. The aim of this work was to
      analyze the relationship between residential sun exposure and the risk of
      incident CD or ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: The E3N cohort consists of women
      living in France, aged 40 to 65 years and free of major diseases at inclusion in 
      1990. Among the 91,870 women included in the study, we identified 123 incident
      cases (45 CD, 71 UC, and 7 indeterminate colitis). To assess residential sun
      exposure, we used a database containing mean daily ultraviolet radiation (UVR)
      dose for each French county. The relationship between residential sun exposure
      and risk of incident inflammatory bowel diseases was explored using Cox models.
      RESULTS: Higher levels of residential sun exposure were associated with a
      significant decreased risk of CD (hazard ratio [HR] for the third versus the
      first tertile of UVR dose, 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.23-1.01; P for
      trend = 0.04), but not of UC (HR, 1.21; CI, 0.61-2.11). In women with available
      data on dietary vitamin D intake, we observed a lower risk of CD with higher
      residential UVR (HR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.11-0.80; P for trend = 0.01). Dietary
      vitamin D intake was neither associated with the risk of CD (HR, 0.41; 95% CI,
      0.14-1.24; P for trend = 0.14) nor UC (HR, 1.61; CI, 0.61-4.23). CONCLUSIONS: In 
      this prospective cohort of women, high residential sunlight exposure was
      associated with decreased incidence of CD, but not UC.

TI  - ESPGHAN revised porto criteria for the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease in
      children and adolescents.
PG  - 795-806
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000239 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of pediatric-onset inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD)
      can be challenging in choosing the most informative diagnostic tests and
      correctly classifying PIBD into its different subtypes. Recent advances in our
      understanding of the natural history and phenotype of PIBD, increasing
      availability of serological and fecal biomarkers, and the emergence of novel
      endoscopic and imaging technologies taken together have made the previous Porto
      criteria for the diagnosis of PIBD obsolete. METHODS: We aimed to revise the
      original Porto criteria using an evidence-based approach and consensus process to
      yield specific practice recommendations for the diagnosis of PIBD. These revised 
      criteria are based on the Paris classification of PIBD and the original Porto
      criteria while incorporating novel data, such as for serum and fecal biomarkers. 
      A consensus of at least 80% of participants was achieved for all recommendations 
      and the summary algorithm. RESULTS: The revised criteria depart from existing
      criteria by defining 2 categories of ulcerative colitis (UC, typical and
      atypical); atypical phenotypes of UC should be treated as UC. A novel approach
      based on multiple criteria for diagnosing IBD-unclassified (IBD-U) is proposed.
      Specifically, these revised criteria recommend upper gastrointestinal endoscopy
      and ileocolonscopy for all suspected patients with PIBD, with small bowel imaging
      (unless typical UC after endoscopy and histology) by magnetic resonance
      enterography or wireless capsule endoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: These revised Porto
      criteria for the diagnosis of PIBD have been developed to meet present challenges
      and developments in PIBD and provide up-to-date guidelines for the definition and
      diagnosis of the IBD spectrum.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) starting during childhood has been
      assumed to impair quality of life (QoL) of affected children. As this aspect is
      crucial for further personality development, the health-related quality of life
      (HRQOL) was assessed in a Swiss nationwide cohort to obtain detailed information 
      on the fields of impairment. METHODS: Data were prospectively acquired from
      pediatric patients included in the Swiss IBD Cohort Study. IBD activity was
      evaluated by PCDAI and PUCAI. The age adapted KIDSCREEN questionnaire was
      evaluated for 110 children with IBD (64 with Crohn's disease 46 with ulcerative
      colitis). Data were analyzed with respect to established reference values of
      healthy controls. RESULTS: In the KIDSCREEN index a moderate impairment was only 
      found for physical wellbeing due to disease activity. In contrast, mental
      well-being and social support were even better as compared to control values. A
      subgroup analysis revealed that this observation was restricted to the children
      in the German speaking part of Switzerland, whereas there was no difference
      compared to controls in the French part of Switzerland. Furthermore, autonomy and
      school variables were significantly higher in the IBD patients as compared to
      controls. CONCLUSIONS: The social support for children with IBD is excellent in
      this cohort. Only physical well-being was impaired due to disease activity,
      whereas all other KIDSCREEN parameters were better as compared to controls. This 
      indicates that effective coping and support strategies may be able to compensate 
      the burden of disease in pediatric IBD patients.

AB  - An expert panel of the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) and
      European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition
      (ESPGHAN) initiated a consensus process to produce the first pediatric specific
      ulcerative colitis (UC) guidelines based on a systematic literature review.
      Treatment strategies must reflect that pediatric-onset UC has a slightly
      different phenotype than adult-onset disease with more often extensive
      (pancolitis) and more aggressive disease course. Other pediatric-specific aspects
      include growth, puberty, bone density accrual and emotional development and body 
      image acquisition. These differences and others influenced the development of
      pediatric treatment algorithms. It is recommended that virtually all children
      with UC must be treated with some maintenance therapy and 5-ASA requirement and
      dosing are often higher in children. A larger number of children are at risk for 
      steroid-dependency, and this should not be tolerated; steroid sparing strategies 
      with early use of immunosuppressors are recommended in high-risk patients. On the
      other hand, the safety profile of immunosuppressive therapy in children includes 
      the rare forms of lymphomas and many future treatment years. Colectomy and pouch 
      formation should be balanced in the treatment algorithms against the higher rate 
      of future infertility in girls. The acute and on-going management of pediatric UC
      should be guided by evidence- and consensus-based balanced decisions, reflecting 
      a vision of long-term treatment goals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coping is an integral part of adjustment for patients with
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease but has not been well described in the literature.
      This study explored the relationship between coping, perceived health competence,
      patient preference for involvement in their treatment, depression and quality of 
      life, particularly among patients with inactive disease (in remission). METHODS: 
      Subjects (n=70) with active and inactive IBD completed questionnaires, including 
      the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire, Beck Depression
      Inventory, Perceived Health Competence Scale and the Coping Inventory for
      Stressful Situations. The Harvey Bradshaw Index measured disease activity.
      RESULTS: Patients with inactive IBD demonstrated significantly more interest in
      participating in their treatment (p<.05), more perceived health competence
      (p=.001), less depressive symptoms (p<.001), more task oriented coping (p=.02),
      and better quality of life than those with active disease. Only Task Oriented
      Coping was significantly negatively associated with the number of flares among
      inactive patients (p<.001). Patient preference for participation in treatment was
      inversely associated with Avoidance (p=.005), Distraction (p=.008), and Social
      Diversion (p=.008) coping among inactive patients. CONCLUSION: Among patients in 
      remission, those who expressed a greater interest in treatment participation were
      also less likely to practice maladaptive coping. Our data demonstrate that a more
      active coping style may be associated with improved health outcome. Compared to
      patients with active disease, patients in remission are more likely to employ
      task oriented coping, demonstrate a higher interest in treatment participation,
      report greater perceived control of their health, and exhibit less depression
      symptoms. Our findings may increase awareness of the importance of identifying
      coping strategies for IBD patients, including those in remission.

TI  - Dietary arachidonic and oleic acid intake in ulcerative colitis etiology: a
      prospective cohort study using 7-day food diaries.
PG  - 11-8
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0b013e328365c372 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dietary fatty acids may be involved in the etiology of ulcerative
      colitis (UC). Arachidonic acid (AA), an n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid, is a
      precursor of the proinflammatory cytokines prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4,
      and its metabolism is competitively inhibited by oleic acid (OA). This study
      aimed to prospectively investigate whether AA is positively and OA is negatively 
      associated with incident UC development, using data from 7-day food diaries.
      METHODS: A total of 25 639 men and women, aged between 40 and 79 years, from
      Norfolk, UK, were recruited into the prospective European Prospective
      Investigation into Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk cohort between 1993 and 1997. At
      baseline, participants completed 7-day food diaries, checked by nutritionists
      using a database containing 11 000 foods and 55 000 portion sizes. The cohort was
      monitored until June 2004 to identify participants who developed UC. Each patient
      was matched for age and sex with four controls, and conditional logistic
      regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios for AA and OA intakes, and 
      UC association. RESULTS: Of the participants, 26 (58% men) developed incident UC 
      (53% left sided) after a median follow-up time of 3.8 years (0.5-8.3 years). The 
      highest AA tertile was positively associated with an odds ratio of 6.09 [95%
      confidence interval (CI) 1.05-35.23], with a trend across tertiles [odds ratio
      (OR) 2.43, 95% CI 1.06-5.61, P=0.04]. The highest tertile of OA intake was
      inversely associated with a 0.03 OR for UC (95% CI 0.002-0.56) and an inverse
      trend (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.10-0.90, P=0.03). CONCLUSION: Dietary AA was positively 
      and OA was inversely associated with UC development, with large effect sizes in a
      dose-dependent manner. This supports roles for measuring these nutrients in
      future etiological studies and modifying intake in future interventional studies 
      in patients with established disease.

TI  - Exogenous pigment in Peyer patches of children suspected of having IBD.
PG  - 477-80
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000221 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The base of human Peyer patches of the terminal ileum has been noted 
      to contain black granular pigment deposits, composed of titanium dioxide and
      aluminosilicate, which are food additives typically present in a Western diet,
      and pharmaceuticals. In the present study, we investigated the distribution of
      exogenous pigment throughout the gastrointestinal tract of children suspected of 
      having inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the correlation between their age and
      the presence and amount of pigment in Peyer patches, and its relation to
      pediatric IBD. METHODS: Biopsies (upper and lower gastrointestinal tract) from
      children suspected of having IBD who underwent endoscopy, were reassessed by a
      blinded, expert pathologist. The amount of pigment in biopsies was scored using a
      semiquantitative scale (range 0 to +++). RESULTS: A total of 151 children were
      included: 62 with Crohn disease (CD), 26 with ulcerative colitis, and 63 with
      non-IBD. In 63 children (42%), deposits of black pigment were found only in
      biopsies from the terminal ileum, located in Peyer patches. A significant
      correlation was found between increasing age and the amount of pigment (P =
      0.004). Pigment deposits were found significantly less in the patients with CD
      compared with those in patients with ulcerative colitis and those with non-IBD
      (26% vs 62% and 49%, P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: These results provide support for
      the hypothesis that the amount of pigment, only present in Peyer patches in the
      terminal ileum, becomes denser with increasing age. Absence of pigment in Peyer
      patches in a higher number of patients with CD suggests that microparticles may
      have become involved in the inflammatory process, possibly because of disrupted
      autophagy.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present study was to determine the incidence of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and its subgroups in children in northeastern
      Slovenia (NE Slovenia) during the period 2002-2010, and to assess the phenotypic 
      characteristics at the diagnosis and during the follow-up. METHODS: A
      retrospective investigation was conducted on a cohort of newly diagnosed children
      and adolescents with IBD ages 0 to 18 years between 2002 and 2010 and residing in
      NE Slovenia. The phenotypic characteristics were determined at presentation and
      during follow-up. The location of Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) 
      was assessed according to the Paris classification at diagnosis, and later in
      patients who had a follow-up period >2 years. The type of therapy at diagnosis
      and during follow-up, and the need for surgery were determined. The study covered
      approximately one-third of the total pediatric population (0-18 years). RESULTS: 
      In total, 107 cases of IBD were diagnosed during the study period. The mean
      annual incidence (per 100,000) was 7.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.3-9.2) for
      all IBD, 4.6 (95% CI 3.6-5.9) for CD, and 2.8 (95% CI 1.9-3.8) for UC. The
      incidences of total IBD, CD, and UC increased from 5.7 (3.8-8.2), 3.9 (2.3-6.1), 
      and 1.8 (0.8-3.5) in the period 2002-2004, respectively, to 8.9 (6.3-12.2), 5.0
      (3.1-7.6), and 3.4 (1.9-5.6) in the period 2008-2010, respectively. During the
      follow-up, the proportion of complicated CD disease behavior
      (stricturing/penetrating) had doubled. A total of 18.5% of patients with CD
      underwent bowel surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of childhood IBD in the
      northeastern part of the country is high and comparable with that reported from
      the developed western countries of Europe, and is probably still increasing. This
      increase may be the result of changes in the lifestyle, especially in dietary
      habits during the last 20 years.

TI  - Pathological fractures in paediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 141-51
LID - 10.1007/s00431-013-2174-5 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Paediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially Crohn's
      disease (CD), is commonly associated with poor skeletal health, related to the
      direct effects of chronic inflammation, prolonged use of glucocorticoid (GC),
      poor nutrition, delayed puberty and low muscle mass. Low bone mineral density is 
      commonly reported, although the prevalence of long bone fractures may not be
      increased in these patients. Emerging evidence however suggests that there may be
      an increased risk of vertebral fractures (VFs) in this group. VFs presenting at
      diagnosis of paediatric CD, prior to any GC exposure, have been reported,
      highlighting the deleterious effect of inflammation on skeletal health. This
      paper reviews the published literature on pathophysiology of skeletal morbidity
      and fractures in paediatric IBD, illustrated with a new case report of multiple
      VFs in a prepubertal girl with CD, soon after diagnosis, who received minimal
      amounts of oral GC. Optimising control of disease, addressing vitamin D
      deficiency, encouraging physical activity and ensuring normal growth and pubertal
      progression are paramount to management of bone health in these patients. Despite
      the lack of evidence, there may be a place for bisphosphonate treatment,
      especially in the presence of symptomatic pathological fractures, but this
      requires close monitoring by clinicians with expertise in paediatric bone health.
      CONCLUSION: Chronic inflammation mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines may have 
      adverse effects on skeletal health in paediatric patients with IBD. The risk of
      vertebral fractures may be increased, even without exposure to glucocorticoid.
      Clinical monitoring of these patients requires careful attention to the various
      factors that impact on bone health.

      colitis.
PG  - 248-52
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0b013e31829f2e06 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infliximab (IFX) is an established treatment modality for moderate to
      severe pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC). The purpose of this study was to
      identify clinical and laboratory parameters, which predict response to IFX in
      pediatric UC defined by colectomy as the primary outcome measure. Postsurgical
      complications were examined as well. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was
      performed on children younger than 19 years who received IFX therapy at Texas
      Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas for the treatment of UC from January 2005 to 
      April 2012. Demographics, laboratory data, clinical subtype, duration of disease,
      transfusion requirement, number of IFX infusions, concurrent medications, and
      postoperative complication with regard to IFX exposure were examined. RESULTS:
      Forty-seven patients (22 male and 25 female; average age at diagnosis: 11.4 y)
      received IFX. Twenty-six (55.3%) required colectomy, 20 (42.6%) of which occurred
      within a year of therapy initiation. Disease duration <20 months before IFX
      initiation, increased the likelihood of a colectomy within a year [OR: 3.8 (95%
      CI, 1.6-13.3), P=0.044]. Blood transfusion requirement before IFX was associated 
      with higher rates of colectomy within a year [OR: 9.78 (95% CI, 2.2-43.3),
      P=0.0028]. Preoperative exposure to IFX within 8 weeks did not significantly
      increase postoperative complications (P=0.26). Serum albumin levels at diagnosis 
      did not predict colectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Shorter disease duration and need for
      blood transfusion may be useful indicators of limited response to IFX in
      pediatric UC.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Clostridium difficile is the major cause of
      antibiotic-associated diarrhea and is the most well known bacterial pathogen
      associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Enterotoxigenic Clostridium
      perfringens has also been detected in up to 15% of antibiotic-associated diarrhea
      cases, and it has not been found in healthy people. The aim of this study was to 
      investigate the prevalence of C. perfringens infection in pediatric patients with
      IBD. METHODS: This was a prospective, controlled study evaluating pediatric IBD
      patients in the Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition in Warsaw,
      Poland. All of the patients were diagnosed according to the Porto criteria. There
      were two control groups: (1) non-IBD patients that were suspected for bacterial
      diarrhea and (2) healthy children. Stool samples were collected on the day of
      admission. C. perfringens infection diagnosis was based on a positive stool
      enzyme immunoassay (C. perfringens enterotoxin test kit TechLab). RESULTS: 91
      fecal specimens from patients with IBD were collected. The average patient age
      was 11.7 years in IBD group, 7.4 years in non-IBD patients with diarrhea, and 7.4
      years in healthy children. The prevalence of C. perfringens infection was 9%
      (8/91; CI 95% 4.6-16.4). There were more Crohn's patients (6/8) in the C.
      perfringens positive group. There was no C. perfringens infection in the two
      control groups. CONCLUSION: Our pilot data add evidence to the hypothesis that
      Clostridia other than C. difficile may play a significant role in the clinical
      course of IBD. However, further studies are needed to confirm this.

TI  - A decrease of the butyrate-producing species Roseburia hominis and
      Faecalibacterium prausnitzii defines dysbiosis in patients with ulcerative
      colitis.
PG  - 1275-83
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2013-304833 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacteria play an important role in the onset and perpetuation of
      intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Unlike in Crohn's
      disease (CD), in which dysbiosis has been better characterised, in ulcerative
      colitis (UC), only small cohorts have been studied and showed conflicting data.
      Therefore, we evaluated in a large cohort if the microbial signature described in
      CD is also present in UC, and if we could characterise predominant dysbiosis in
      UC. To assess the functional impact of dysbiosis, we quantified the bacterial
      metabolites. DESIGN: The predominant microbiota from 127 UC patients and 87 age
      and sex-matched controls was analysed using denaturing gradient gel
      electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis. Differences were quantitatively validated using 
      real-time PCR. Metabolites were quantified using gas chromatography-mass
      spectrometry. RESULTS: Based on DGGE analysis, the microbial signature previously
      described in CD was not present in UC. Real-time PCR analysis revealed a lower
      abundance of Roseburia hominis (p<0.0001) and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii
      (p<0.0001) in UC patients compared to controls. Both species showed an inverse
      correlation with disease activity. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) were reduced in
      UC patients (p=0.014), but no direct correlation between SCFA and the identified 
      bacteria was found. CONCLUSIONS: The composition of the fecal microbiota of UC
      patients differs from that of healthy individuals: we found a reduction in R
      hominis and F prausnitzii, both well-known butyrate-producing bacteria of the
      Firmicutes phylum. These results underscore the importance of dysbiosis in IBD
      but suggest that different bacterial species contribute to the pathogenesis of UC
      and CD.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Curcumin, an active ingredient of turmeric with
      anti-inflammatory properties, has been demonstrated to be useful in experimental 
      models of ulcerative colitis (UC). It's efficacy in humans needs to be
      investigated. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, single-centre pilot trial was 
      conducted in patients with distal UC (<25 cm involvement) and mild-to-moderate
      disease activity. Forty-five patients were randomized to either NCB-02
      (standardized curcumin preparation) enema plus oral 5-ASA or placebo enema plus
      oral 5-ASA. Primary end point was disease response, defined as reduction in
      Ulcerative Colitis Diseases Activity Index by 3 points at 8 weeks, and secondary 
      end points were improvement in endoscopic activity and disease remission at 8
      weeks. RESULTS: Response to treatment was observed in 56.5% in NCB-02 group
      compared to 36.4% (p=0.175) in placebo group. At week 8, clinical remission was
      observed in 43.4% of patients in NCB-02 group compared to 22.7% in placebo group 
      (p=0.14) and improvement on endoscopy in 52.2% of patients in NCB-02 group
      compared to 36.4% of patients in placebo group (p=0.29). Per protocol analysis
      revealed significantly better outcomes in NCB-02 group, in terms of clinical
      response (92.9% vs. 50%, p=0.01), clinical remission (71.4% vs. 31.3%, p=0.03),
      and improvement on endoscopy (85.7% vs. 50%, p=0.04). CONCLUSION: In this pilot
      study we found some evidence that use of NCB-02 enema may tend to result in
      greater improvements in disease activity compared to placebo in patients with
      mild-to-moderate distal UC. The role of NCB-02 as a novel therapy for UC should
      be investigated further.

TI  - Advances in the medical management of paediatric IBD.
PG  - 99-108

AB  - IBD includes two classic entities, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, and a 
      third undetermined form (IBD-U), characterized by a chronic relapsing course
      resulting in a high rate of morbidity and impaired quality of life. Children with
      IBD are vulnerable in terms of growth failure, malnutrition and emotional
      effects. The aims of therapy have now transitioned from symptomatic control to
      the achievement of mucosal healing and deep remission. This type of therapy has
      been made possible by the advent of disease-modifying drugs, such as biologic
      agents, which are capable of interrupting the inflammatory cascade underlying
      IBD. Biologic agents are generally administered in patients who are refractory to
      conventional therapies. However, there is growing support that such agents could 
      be used in the initial phases of the disease, typically in paediatric patients,
      to interrupt and cease the inflammatory process. Until several years ago, most
      therapeutic programmes in paediatric patients with IBD were borrowed from adult
      trials, whereas paediatric studies were often retrospective and uncontrolled.
      However, guidelines on therapeutic management of paediatric IBD and controlled,
      prospective, randomized trials including children with IBD have now been
      published. Here, the current knowledge concerning treatment options for children 
      with IBD are reported. We also highlight the effectiveness and safety of new
      therapeutic advances in these paediatric patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The association of fatigue with decreased physical performance
      and underlying mechanisms are poorly understood in Crohn's disease (CD). We aimed
      to measure and compare self-reported fatigue with skeletal muscle fatigue in CD
      subjects and healthy controls, and to identify associated factors that may be
      amenable to change. METHODS: Demographic and clinical data were collected and
      fatigue assessed using the Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS) in 27 consecutive CD
      patients and 22 matched healthy controls. Circulating cytokines and growth
      factors were measured. The rate of quadriceps muscle fatigue was assessed using
      an isokinetic dynamometer as the decrement of force with 30 contractions
      performed over a 5-minute period. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, CD
      patients reported greater levels of fatigue (mean global FIS score 45.3 vs 10.5, 
      physical dimension score 12.3 vs 2.7 respectively; each p<0.01) and muscle
      fatigue (-5.2 vs -1.3 Nm min(-1); p<0.05). The two indices were correlated (r =
      -0.52 in CD; p<0.01). Patients with CD had lower mean serum IGF-1 levels (16.1 vs
      25.4 pmol/L, p<0.01) and higher oxidative stress (TBARS assay 4.3 vs 3.9 muM,
      p<0.05). On multivariate analysis, low serum vitamin D, IGF-1 and magnesium, and 
      higher IL-6 levels were associated with increased muscle fatigue (all p </=
      0.05). CONCLUSION: Subjects with CD had more muscle fatigue than matched healthy 
      controls and this correlated well with self-reported fatigue. Of circulating
      factors that were independently associated with increased muscle fatigue, vitamin
      D, magnesium and IGF-1 could be targeted in future studies to reduce fatigue and 
      improve physical performance.

      of inflammatory bowel disease in adults and children.

LID - S1542-3565(13)01044-6 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The level of fecal calprotectin (FC) can predict the onset of 
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with high accuracy and precision. We evaluated
      the cost-effectiveness of using measurements of FC to identify adults and
      children who require endoscopic confirmation of IBD. METHODS: We constructed a
      decision analytic tree to compare the cost-effectiveness of measuring FC before
      endoscopy examination with that of direct endoscopic evaluation alone. A second
      decision analytic tree was constructed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of FC
      cutoff levels of 100 mug/g vs 50 mug/g (typically used to screen for intestinal
      inflammation). The primary outcome measure was the incremental cost required to
      avoid 1 false-negative result by using FC level to diagnose new-onset IBD.
      RESULTS: In adults, FC screening saved $417/patient but delayed diagnosis for
      2.2/32 patients with IBD among 100 screened patients. In children, FC screening
      saved $300/patient but delayed diagnosis for 4.8/61 patients with IBD among 100
      screened patients. If endoscopic biopsy analysis remained the standard for
      diagnosis, direct endoscopic evaluation would cost an additional $18,955 in
      adults and $6250 in children to avoid 1 false-negative result from FC screening. 
      Sensitivity analyses showed that cost-effectiveness of FC screening varied with
      the sensitivity of the test and the pre-test probability of IBD in adults and
      children. Pre-test probabilities for IBD of </=75% in adults and </=65% in
      children made FC screening cost-effective, but it was cost-ineffective if the
      probabilities were >/=85% and >/=78% in adults and children, respectively.
      Compared with the FC cutoff level of 100 mug/g, the cutoff level of 50 mug/g cost
      an additional $55 and $43 for adults and children, respectively, but it yielded
      2.4 and 6.1 additional accurate diagnoses of IBD per 100 screened adults and
      children, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Screening adults and children to measure
      fecal levels of calprotectin is effective and cost-effective in identifying those
      with IBD on a per-case basis when the pre-test probability is </=75% for adults
      and </=65% for children. The utility of the test is greater for adults than
      children. Increasing the FC cutoff level to >/=50 mug/g increases diagnostic
      accuracy without substantially increasing total cost.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) arachidonic acid (AA,
      n-6) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, n-3) are precursors of eicosanoids and other
      lipid mediators which have critical roles in inflammation. The mediators formed
      from the different PUFA have different potencies. We hypothesised that metabolic 
      changes associated with colonic mucosal inflammation would modify the
      bioavailability of the eicosanoid precursors AA and EPA. METHODS: Colonic mucosa 
      biopsies were obtained from patients with ulcerative colitis and from matched
      controls. Inflammation was graded endoscopically and histologically. Esterified
      and non-esterified fatty acids were determined within the biopsies using gas
      chromatography-mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry,
      respectively. RESULTS: Biopsy samples were collected from 69 UC patients (54
      providing both inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa) and 69 controls. Inflamed mucosa
      had higher AA (p<0.001) and lower EPA (p<0.010) contents and a higher AA:EPA
      ratio (p<0.001). Inflamed mucosa also had higher docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) and 
      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and lower linoleic acid (LA) and alpha-linolenic acid 
      (alpha-LNA) contents (all p<0.001), compared to non-inflamed and controls. There 
      were significant correlations between severity of inflammation and contents of
      AA, DPA and DHA (positive correlations) and of LA, alpha-LNA and EPA (negative
      correlations). CONCLUSIONS: Higher AA, AA:EPA ratio, DPA and DHA and lower LA,
      alpha-LNA and EPA are seen in inflamed mucosa in UC and correlate with severity
      of inflammation. This suggests an alteration in fatty acid metabolism in the
      inflamed gut mucosa, which may offer novel targets for intervention and should be
      considered if nutritional strategies are used.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) occurring during childhood is generally
      extensive and is associated with severe flares that may require intravenous
      steroid treatment. In cases of corticosteroid resistance is necessary to
      introduce a second-line treatment to avoid or delay surgery. AIMS: To describe
      the efficacy and safety of oral tacrolimus for the treatment of severe
      steroid-resistant UC. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study that included
      all patients under age 18 suffering from severe steroid-resistant UC treated with
      oral tacrolimus during the period January 1998 to October 2012 and with a
      follow-up period after treatment of 24 months or more. RESULTS: A total of ten
      patients were included. The age at baseline was 9.4+/-4.9 years, and the time
      from diagnosis was 1.3 months (IQR, 1-5.7). Seven of the patients were in their
      first flare of disease. All of them received an oral dose of 0.12 mg/kg/day of
      tacrolimus divided in two doses. Trough plasma levels of tacrolimus were
      maintained between 4 and 13 ng/ml. Response was seen in 5/10 patients at 12
      months, colectomy was eventually performed in 60% of patients during the
      follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Tacrolimus is useful in inducing remission in
      patients with severe steroid-resistant UC, preventing or delaying colectomy, and 
      allowing the patient and family to prepare for a probable surgery. Tacrolimus may
      also be used as a treatment bridge for corticosteroid-dependent patients until
      the new maintenance therapy takes effect.
