TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease in infancy: an increasing problem?
PG  - 569-76
AB  - Seven children with intractable diarrhoea of infancy seen between 1990 and 1993
      developed endoscopically established inflammatory bowel disease unrelated to
      bacterial infection and not responsive to whole protein exclusion. Mouth ulcers
      were present in two patients, endoscopic upper-gastrointestinal-tract
      inflammation in two, villous atrophy in six, and chronic nonspecific colitis in
      all seven. There was considerable clinical and histological heterogeneity. All
      patients required parenteral nutrition. Steroid therapy was completely successful
      in only one child, while two underwent colectomy, and two died. Previously
      described cases other than those due to infection or milk intolerance have been
      rare and sporadic. The prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease in infancy is
      unknown but appears to be increasing.

TI  - Newer treatments for inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 577-608
AB  - Despite intense investigative efforts, the causes of ulcerative colitis and
      Crohn's disease remain elusive. The mainstay of medical therapy focuses on
      inhibition of the effects of the inflammatory mediators operant in inflammatory
      bowel disease because the causes of these two chronic disorders are unknown.
      During recent years, the physician's armamentarium for medical treatment of
      inflammatory bowel disease has increased substantially. In this article, the
      current standard medical therapies available for treatment of patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease are reviewed along with their efficacy; the side
      effects and status of other investigative drugs also are reviewed.

TI  - Elevation of serum interleukin-6 but not serum-soluble interleukin-2 receptor in 
      children with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 164-71
AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated elevated serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) 
      and the soluble interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R, CD25) in individuals with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of our study was to compare serum IL-6 
      and IL-2R levels to see if one marker better distinguished IBD from other
      intestinal disorders or better reflected disease activity. Blood samples were
      obtained from 41 pediatric patients with Crohn's disease, 22 with ulcerative
      colitis, 19 with other gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders, and 13 with
      functional abdominal pain. Disease activity and disease location were determined 
      for patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Serum levels of IL-6
      and IL-2R were determined by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Mean
      serum levels of IL-6 were significantly elevated (p < 0.05) in patients with
      Crohn's disease when compared with individuals with ulcerative colitis, other
      gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders, or functional abdominal pain. By
      comparison, there was no significant difference in mean serum levels of IL-2R in 
      individuals with Crohn's disease compared with these other groups. Patients with 
      moderate/severe Crohn's disease had elevated mean serum levels of IL-6 and IL-2R 
      when compared with those with mild and inactive disease (p < 0.05); however,
      neither marker distinguished between inactive and mild disease. IL-6 correlated
      better with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR; r = 0.57, p < 0.001) than
      did IL-2R (r = 0.28, p < 0.01). Our results suggest that elevated IL-6 levels a.e
      more likely to be seen in patients with Crohn's disease. Although IL-6 may be a
      better marker for Crohn's disease and active disease than IL-2R, it does not
      appear to offer any advantage over the ESR.

TI  - [Ambulatory education of patient with Crohn disease/ulcerative colitis].
PG  - 411-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient education has been accepted widely over the past years as a
      valid component of disease management in patients with chronic diseases. The aim 
      of our study was to evaluate the effects of patient education in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease. Participation in a patient education program should
      increase the patient's disease-related knowledge and positively influence the
      patient's quality of life, depression, beliefs of internal control and social
      activity. METHODS: We studied 36 patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis: 18 were educated in four sessions, 18 were not educated (control-group).
      The following topics were presented: diagnosis, causes and course of disease;
      medication and surgery; nutrition and social benefits and stress management and
      coping with the disease. RESULTS: The effects of the program were evaluated
      before, immediately and three months after the intervention using questionnaires.
      Participants in the program showed a significant increase in knowledge after
      three months compared with the non-participants. There were positive, although
      not significant effects on psychosocial variables. CONCLUSION: Patient education 
      is a valuable means to increase knowledge of disease and treatment in patient's
      with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Effects on psychosocial variables
      need to be examined on a long term basis in larger patient groups.

TI  - Cyclosporine and 6-mercaptopurine for active, refractory Crohn's colitis in
      children.
PG  - 1355-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This prospective, open trial of treatment was conducted to determine 
      whether cyclosporine A (CSA) is effective in inducing remission in children with 
      severe, active Crohn's colitis refractory to other medical treatment and if
      remission may be maintained by 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and 5-aminosalicylic acid 
      (5-ASA) after discontinuing CSA. METHODS: Ten children (five males, five
      females), ages 1.2-16 yr (mean 11), all had failed to respond to 4 wk of
      treatment with i.v. methylprednisolone and total parenteral nutrition/elemental
      diet; three were already receiving 6-mercaptopurine. CSA was initially given as a
      twice daily i.v. dosage and was switched to oral CSA when a clinical response was
      observed. At the same time, corticosteroids were switched to the oral route and
      tapered over the next 3 months. Patients were grouped by treatment outcome.
      "Responders" were those who achieved remission with i.v. CSA therapy, "relapsers"
      were those who achieved remission with i.v. CSA but relapsed later, and
      nonresponders had not achieved remission after 4 wk of i.v. CSA. Responders were 
      given 6-MP with intent to discontinue CSA after 6 months and maintain remission
      by 6-MP and 5-ASA. RESULTS: There were seven responders to CSA. For all patients,
      the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) (score range 0-100) had a
      mean value of 55 (range 40-65) just before treatment; PCDAI improved to a mean of
      19 (range 5-42.5) after 2 wk of CSA therapy. Four of the seven responders
      discontinued CSA after 6 months and remain well on 6-MP and 5ASA alone for 22,
      13, 8, and 3 months. One patient had massive GI bleeding (from active Crohn's
      colitis), which stopped within 48 h of CSA treatment. There were three relapsers 
      (at 2-6 months of CSA), and three were nonresponders. Three patients who were
      already receiving 6-MP before CSA therapy either did not respond to CSA or
      relapsed while receiving it. The six nonresponders and relapsers required
      surgical resection. Transient side effects included hypertension responding to
      nifedipine in one child and hirsutism and tremors in another. CONCLUSIONS: We
      conclude that CSA offers a good remission rate for children with severe Crohn's
      colitis failing other medical treatment, although relapse was common especially
      if the child was already on 6-MP. In addition, CSA may offer "temporizing"
      therapy in severe, active Crohn's colitis; this may allow surgery to be performed
      electively, with time for psychosocial and nutritional preparation before
      surgery.

TI  - [Digestive manifestations in hemolytic uremic syndrome in children].
PG  - 533-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastro-intestinal manifestations are relatively frequent during the
      course of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), some of them requiring special
      supportive care. This work was aimed at retrospectively studing gastrointestinal 
      manifestations of HUS and determining their place in the prognosis. PATIENTS:
      Thirty-seven children aged 4 months to 11 years (22 girls and 15 boys) were
      included in the study. RESULTS: All children but one had gastrointestinal
      prodromes. During the course of HUS, various manifestations were seen: bloody
      diarrhea in 32% of patients, ileo-ileal intussusception in 3%, rectal prolapse in
      8% and hepatic cytolysis in 38%. Seven patients with bloody diarrhea had a
      complicated course, lethal in one. Comparison between these seven children and
      the 30 others revealed some indicators of severe gut involvement: female sex,
      short duration of gastrointestinal prodromes, hemorrhagic colitis with rectal
      prolapse, high WBC count, high neutrophils count and less important degree of
      anemia at admission. Severity of the gastrointestinal lesions was correlated with
      that of the outcome of the renal disease. CONCLUSION: Gastrointestinal tract is
      frequently affected in HUS and severe complications can appear, potentially
      leading to death. Total parenteral nutrition could prevent occurrence of
      gastrointestinal complications. Severe gastrointestinal lesions are associated
      with a poor renal outcome.

PG  - 693-6
AB  - HISTORY: Severe ulcerative colitis had been diagnosed in a 25-year-old man six
      years ago. That same year he underwent laparoscopy for mechanical ileus. Since
      then he has been on a maintenance dose of sulphasalazine without any further
      symptoms. Because of a known pseudopolyposis coli, repeat coloscopy was
      performed. EXAMINATIONS AND FINDINGS: The endoscope was smoothly introduced and
      the examination was without pain. No premedication had been given. A biopsy was
      obtained during withdrawal of the endoscope. Suddenly the patient noticed marked 
      scrotal swelling. The examination was terminated abruptly. No lesions of the wall
      of the distal colon were seen when the endoscope was pulled out immediately.
      Quickly, cutaneous emphysema developed over the right side of the abdomen and
      thorax up to the neck. The patient could no more properly hear his own voice.
      Radiology demonstrated bilateral pneumoretroperitoneum, mediastinal emphysema and
      pneumothorax. TREATMENT AND COURSE: The patient was put on parenteral nutrition
      for 4 days and prophylactically received amoxycillin, calvulanic acid and
      metronidazole. The air was gradually absorbed and the patient discharged
      symptom-free after 7 days. CONCLUSION: In contrast to intraperitoneal
      perforation, which usually causes acute symptoms of peritonitis and requires
      urgent surgical treatment, the course of the much rarer retroperitoneal
      perforation is more benign with few symptoms and can be managed conservatively.

TI  - Effect of pregnancy on the clinical course of a cohort of women with inflammatory
      bowel disease.
PG  - 199-204
AB  - The incidence of relapses of inflammatory bowel disease in pregnancy ranges from 
      20 to 35%. The effect of pregnancy on Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis
      after pregnancy has been investigated here. During the survey period, 29
      pregnancies occurred in 18 Crohn's patients, and 25 in 19 ulcerative colitis
      patients. Incidence of relapses during pregnancy and post-partum was 14 and 17%
      in Crohn's, and 36 and 12% in ulcerative colitis. Fourteen Crohn's patients (17
      pregnancies) and 17 ulcerative colitis patients (19 pregnancies) were followed
      for 3 years before pregnancy and for 4 years after delivery. During the 3 years
      after pregnancy, the number of relapses/year was significantly lower compared to 
      the 3 years before pregnancy and to the incidence in controls, both in Crohn's (p
      < 0.05) and ulcerative colitis (p < 0.005). Changes in nutritional status were
      recorded in 41% of Crohn's, but in none of the ulcerative colitis patients. The
      reduced incidence of relapses following delivery in Crohn's patients was more
      marked in the 10 with normal nutritional status at the time of conception (70%
      reduction in number of relapses, p < 0.05), while in the 7 significantly
      underweight patients, the reduction was slight (27% reduction in number of
      relapses, p = NS). In conclusion, the incidence of relapses in the first 3 years 
      after pregnancy is lower than in the pre-pregnancy period. In Crohn's disease,
      the effect is more evident in patients with normal nutritional status at the time
      of conception than in malnourished patients.

TI  - Interchange between collagenous and lymphocytic colitis in severe disease with
      autoimmune associations requiring colectomy: a case report.
PG  - 788-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis present with a similar
      clinical picture. Whether these conditions are separate entities or whether they 
      represent different pathological stages of the same condition is an unresolved
      issue. PATIENT: This is a case of collagenous colitis following a fulminant
      course in which a colectomy was necessary. In the operative specimen the
      thickened collagen plate, which had been present only two weeks preoperatively
      had been lost and the pathology was of a lymphocytic colitis. Six months
      postoperatively this patient developed a CREST syndrome and primary biliary
      cirrhosis. CONCLUSIONS: This case shows the lability of the collagen plate and
      the common ground between collagenous and lymphocytic colitis, and presents
      evidence that these two conditions are different manifestations of the same
      disease. It also describes for the first time an association between collagenous 
      colitis and CREST syndrome and primary biliary cirrhosis.

TI  - Perianal Crohn's disease in children and adolescents.
PG  - 922-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To review the frequency, severity, course, and outcome of perianal
      Crohn's disease in children and adolescents. METHODS: Records of 141 children and
      adolescents with Crohn's disease were reviewed. Of these, 18 patients (eight
      female, 10 male) between 9 and 18 yr of age (nine blacks and nine whites) had
      significant perianal disease. The disease was classified on the basis external
      appearance, degree of inflammation, presence of infection or abscess formation,
      spread to vulva, loss of perineal body, and occurrence of anal canal stricture as
      being mild, moderate, or severe. RESULTS: Eight patients had severe involvement, 
      whereas moderate and mild degree of perianal disease was seen in six and four
      patients, respectively. Disease localization was as follows: pancolitis, 12;
      ileocolitis, four; and left colitis, two. Therapy with Azulfidine or 5-amino
      salicylic acid preparation, local and systemic steroids, metronidazole,
      immunosuppressives, and enteral and/or parenteral nutrition was used in various
      combinations. Surgery was necessary in eight patients: in four for management of 
      anal canal stricture, incision and drainage of abscess in two, total
      proctocolectomy in one, and fecal diversion in an additional patient. Over a
      follow-up period ranging from 18 months to 15 yr, nine patients had partial
      improvement, whereas in the rest, the disease either did not improve or worsened.
      CONCLUSIONS: Severe, mutilating perianal Crohn's disease, causing significant
      tissue destruction, occurs in both sexes and is extremely refractory to treatment
      in the majority of patients. The outcome in mild and moderate disease is better.

TI  - Whole-bowel irrigation as an adjunct to the treatment of chronic, relapsing
      Clostridium difficile colitis.
PG  - 186-9
AB  - We report the successful treatment of two patients with chronic, intractable
      Clostridium difficile infection using whole-bowel irrigation with a polyethylene 
      glycol solution (Golytely) as adjunctive therapy. Before this treatment, both
      patients had recurrent symptoms of diarrhea, weight loss, abdominal pain, and
      documented C. difficile toxin-positive stools despite multiple pharmacologic
      treatments. Each child was prescribed myriad drug therapies, including
      vancomycin, metronidazole, bacitracin, and rifampin. Cholestyramine and
      lactobacillus were also tried alone and in combination with antibiotics. In each 
      case, symptoms recurred shortly after cessation of therapy. Whole-bowel
      irrigation was subsequently administered until profuse, clear liquid stools were 
      produced. This treatment was followed by a 3-week course of oral vancomycin and
      lactobacillus. In both cases, the patient became asymptomatic within 3 days of
      therapy; they have remained symptom-free for 36 and 48 months, respectively. We
      suggest that whole-bowel irrigation clears active C. difficile organisms, toxins,
      and spores from the intestine and is effective as an adjunct to routine therapy
      for chronic, relapsing C. difficile infections.

TI  - MUC2 is the prominent colonic mucin expressed in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 554-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been shown that MUC2 is the prominent mucin synthesised in
      healthy colon. AIM: To identify the predominant mucins in ulcerative colitis (UC)
      and to study their biosynthesis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mucin was purified from UC 
      resection specimens. This mucin on sodium dodecylsulphate polyacrylamide gel
      electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) presented as one, high molecular weight, periodic
      acid/Schiff's reagent (PAS) stainable band. Amino acid composition showed a close
      resemblance to that of MUC2. Immunoprecipitation with a specific anti-MUC2
      antiserum confirmed that this mucin was MUC2. In addition, on the mRNA level MUC2
      was also the most prominent mucin expressed in UC. Polyclonal antiserum was
      elicited, mainly recognising mucin peptide epitopes of UC and normal colonic
      mucin. Biosynthetic studies with [35S]amino acids showed that the MUC2-precursor 
      in UC displayed a molecular mass on SDS-PAGE of approximately 600 kDa. This
      precursor was converted into a mature MUC2 with anomalous mobility on SDS-PAGE of
      550 kDa and was secreted. Only this 550 kDa band could be labelled with
      [35S]sulphate and stained by PAS. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that in parallel 
      with the mucin expression in healthy controls, MUC2 is the major mucin expressed 
      in UC. Qualitatively, MUC2 biosynthesis seems unchanged in UC.

      disease.
PG  - 151-8
AB  - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic inflammatory diseases of the
      bowel often associated with significant malnutrition, particularly in children
      because of increased nutrient demands due to growth. We discuss the increasingly 
      prominent role of nutritional support in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Issues
      that are addressed include the etiology of malnutrition in IBD, assessment and
      monitoring of patient nutritional status and the use of nutrition in the
      management of growth failure and as primary medical therapy.

TI  - Effect of 4G-beta-D-galactosylsucrose (lactosucrose) on fecal microflora in
      patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 33-9
AB  - Metabolic interaction between the intestinal microflora and the host has been
      suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory bowel
      disease. Elemental or low-fat, low-residual diets in patients with Crohn's
      disease or ulcerative colitis are reported to decrease anaerobic bacteria and to 
      change the composition of the intestinal microflora. We examined the effect of an
      indigestible agent, 4G-beta-D-galactosylsucrose (lactosucrose), which is
      selectively utilized by intestinal Bifidobacterium, on the composition of the
      intestinal microflora. After the administration of lactosucrose to two patients
      with Crohn's disease and five patients with ulcerative colitis for 2 weeks,
      significant induction of the growth of Bifidobacterium was observed, and
      significant reduction in the population level of Bacteroidaceae was seen. Bowel
      movements improved in four patients. The intestinal environment, estimated by
      measuring fecal pH, fecal levels of short-chain fatty acids and putrid products, 
      and the urinary secretion of indican, also improved in these patients. These
      results suggest that lactosucrose may be useful for patients with chronic
      inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - [Diarrhea caused by antibiotic therapy].
PG  - 171-6
AB  - Diarrhoea, or any change in bowel habits, occurs in up to 30% of the individuals 
      treated by antimicrobial agents. Most cases of such diarrhoea are benign and
      secondary to a transient dysfunction of normal colonic flora induced by the
      antibiotic treatment. In some cases, the antibiotic-induced alteration of the
      normal gut flora leads to the establishment of pathogens, of which Clostridium
      difficile is the most important. C. difficile intestinal infection results in a
      wide spectrum of diseases, ranging from benign diarrhoea without colitis to
      life-threatening cases of relapsing pseudomembranous colitis.

      questionnaire and first French data].
PG  - 1071-7
AB  - UNLABELLED: Inflammatory bowel diseases have an important impact on the daily
      life of patients. This impact can be measured by the evaluation of the health
      related quality of life. The aim of this study was to develop and to validate a
      questionnaire of quality of life in a French population. METHODS: The
      questionnaire comprised 70 items and was completed in 15 min. It was made up of
      a) a general questionnaire of 36 items (SF-36) exploring daily physical and
      social functioning, mental and general health, body pain and vitality. A sleep
      module of 6 items was added. b) a specific questionnaire of 28 items (RFIPC),
      exploring the concerns of the patients. The questionnaire was self-administered
      to 101 patients with Crohn's disease (57 F. 44 M. mean age: 35 years, acute
      disease: 28%, inpatients: 27%), 96 patients with ulcerative colitis (38 F. 58 M. 
      mean age: 39 years, acute disease: 53%, inpatients: 21%). Each patient was sex
      and age matched with a healthy control. RESULTS: The psychometric analysis
      confirmed the validation of the questionnaire for the item's convergent validity,
      internal consistency (Cronbach's coefficient being > 0.70), analyses of
      discrimination. Scores of each scale of SF-36 were worse in patients than in
      controls. Scores of patients with active disease were worse than those of
      patients with quiescent disease. Scores were comparable in patients with Crohn's 
      disease and with ulcerative colitis except for score of pain which was worse in
      acute Crohn's disease. The most important concerns of patients were the uncertain
      nature of the disease, energy level and having surgery. CONCLUSION: This study
      allowed the validation of a questionnaire for the evaluation of the quality of
      life in French patients with inflammatory bowel disease and provides first
      indications which need to be confirmed by future epidemiological studies.

AB  - The paper reviews publication on the use of complete parenteral feeding in the
      multimodality treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. Complete parenteral
      feeding was performed in patients with skeletization and physical retardation, in
      severe diseases, in inefficiency or intolerance of conventional therapy with
      sulfanilamides and steroids, in those who had intestinal fistulas, as well in the
      preparation of patients for surgical treatment. The use of complete parenteral
      feeding, under the above circumstances allow one to achieve persistent remission,
      spontaneous healing of intestinal fistulas, elimination of abnormal metabolism,
      nutrition, constitution, water-electrolyte balance, to reduce a surgical risk and
      the incidence of postoperative complications and the length of patients' hospital
      stay.

TI  - Nutrition and gastrointestinal disease.
PG  - 52-9
AB  - Nutrition and intestinal function are intimately interrelated. The chief purpose 
      of the gut is to digest and absorb nutrients in order to maintain life.
      Consequently, chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disease commonly results in
      malnutrition and increased morbidity and mortality. For example, studies have
      shown that 50-70% of adult patients with Crohn's disease were weight-depleted and
      75% of adolescents growth-retarded. On the other hand, chronic malnutrition
      impairs digestive and absorptive function because food and nutrients are not only
      the major trophic factors to the gut but also provide the building blocks for
      digestive enzymes and absorptive cells. For example, recent studies of ours have 
      shown that a weight loss of greater than 30% accompanying a variety of diseases
      was associated with a reduction in pancreatic enzyme secretion of over 80%,
      villus atrophy and impaired carbohydrate and fat absorption. Finally, specific
      nutrients can induce disease, for example, gluten-sensitive enteropathy, whilst
      dietary factors such as fibre, resistant starch, short-chain fatty acids,
      glutamine and fish-oils may prevent gastrointestinal diseases such as
      diverticulitis, diversion colitis, ulcerative colitis, colonic adenomatosis and
      colonic carcinoma. The role of dietary antigens in the aetiology of Crohn's
      disease is controversial, but controlled studies have suggested that elemental
      diets may be as effective as corticosteroids in inducing a remission in patients 
      with acute Crohn's disease. In conclusion, nutrition has both a supportive and
      therapeutic role in the management of chronic gastrointestinal diseases. With the
      development of modern techniques of nutritional support, the morbidity and
      mortality associated with chronic GI disease can be reduced. On the other hand,
      dietary manipulation may be used to treat to prevent specific GI disorders such
      as coeliac disease, functional bowel disease, Crohn's disease and colonic
      neoplasia. The future development of nutria-pharmaceuticals is particularly
      attractive in view of their low cost and wide safety margins.

TI  - TPN-induced fulminant beriberi: a report on our experience and a review of the
      literature.
PG  - 769-76
AB  - Fulminant beriberi, once considered a rare disease, is now being encountered more
      frequently, yet little is known about its clinical features. This study was
      undertaken to determine the clinical features of total parenteral nutrition
      (TPN)-induced fulminant beriberi by reviewing the clinical data on 10 of our own 
      patients who developed this complication, and 33 cases documented in the
      literature. TPN-induced fulminant beriberi became evident 4-40 days after the
      initiation of TPN, and was more likely to develop in patients with malignancies, 
      ulcerative colitis, and short bowel syndrome, as well as in those receiving
      chemotherapy. Although the patients manifested various symptoms, very few
      developed the classical signs of beriberi or the constant findings seen in
      alcoholic patients. The severity of metabolic acidosis was extremely high and
      refractory to bicarbonate administration, but it responded quickly to intravenous
      (i.v.) thiamine. Thus, rapid i.v. administration of at least 100 mg of thiamine
      is imperative, and the patient must be transferred to the intensive care unit
      when TPN-induced fulminant beriberi develops.

TI  - [Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases and nutrition].
PG  - 14S-24S
AB  - The etiology of inflammatory bowel disease is still unknown. Several potential
      mechanisms are discussed. The etiological and therapeutic importance of nutrition
      is controversial. Though changes in dietary habits and incidence of inflammatory 
      bowel disease during the last century were in parallel, no specific nutritional
      factor has been isolated. No dietary prophylaxis of inflammatory bowel disease is
      yet known; all dietary therapies in inflammatory bowel disease aim to improve
      nutritional support and to diminish inflammation by bowel rest. Children and
      adolescents gain in weight and height. Total parenteral nutrition will not
      substantially reduce disease activity and operation rates. Total parenteral
      nutrition can only be recommended in ulcerative colitis patients with severe
      disease in the initial phase and in Crohn's patients with severe malnutrition and
      intestinal complications. Enteral nutrition support is less effective in
      ulcerative colitis than in Crohn's disease. Reported remission rates on enteral
      nutrition are 25% for ulcerative colitis and up to 80% for Crohn. However, in
      active Crohn's disease enteral nutrition is less effective than standard therapy 
      with methylprednisolone and sulfasalizine. It is generally believed that
      nutrition therapy in combination with drugs is the best treatment modality. There
      is no evidence to support the importance of any combination of the formula diets 
      such as elemental, oligopeptide, or polymeric formulations. Administration of
      formula diets by nasogastric tubes all show similar remission rates. Whether
      newer diets supplemented with arginine, glutamine, omega-3-fatty acids or short
      chain fatty acids increase remission rates is not known. Further studies in this 
      field are warranted.

TI  - Hepatotoxicity of intravenous cyclosporin A in patients with acute ulcerative
      colitis on total parenteral nutrition.
PG  - 320-3
AB  - A group of 24 patients underwent a 7-14-day course of continuously infused
      Cyclosporin A (2 mg.kg-1.day-1) to treat a severe attack of ulcerative colitis.
      In 19 of them, including eight treated with total parenteral nutrition, we
      retrospectively analyzed the serum aminotransferase (AST/ALT) levels at the
      beginning and at the end of Cyclosporin infusion. The baseline levels of AST/ALT 
      in the group were 19.9 +/- 3.2 and 31.4 +/- 6.4; on stopping Cyclosporin
      infusion, they were 43 +/- 15.8 and 119 +/- 56, respectively. Six patients showed
      an ALT change above 1.5 times the upper limit of reference. They included five of
      the eight patients treated with total parenteral nutrition (62.5%). In one of
      six, ALT rose to 1000 U/l and was accompanied by full-blown febrile cholangitis
      (proven by liver biopsy). This episode was preceded by excessive accumulation of 
      Cyclosporin in blood. The development of liver toxicity was independent of the
      length of Cyclosporin treatment, nor did it impair drug efficacy. Thus, in these 
      patients total parenteral nutrition and Cyclosporin were synergistic, causing
      twice the frequency of liver damage (62.5%) reported for ulcerative colitis
      patients on total parenteral nutrition alone (37%). Total parenteral nutrition
      should not be used to support patients needing Cyclosporin for autoimmune
      disease. However, too high a dose of Cyclosporin may cause liver disease per se.

TI  - Circulating neutrophils from patients with ulcerative colitis have a normal
      respiratory burst.
PG  - 701-15
AB  - The hallmark of ulcerative colitis is a diffuse infiltration of neutrophils from 
      the circulation into the colonic mucosa. The underlying mechanism for neutrophil 
      tissue infiltration is unknown. One possible hypothesis is abnormal circulating
      neutrophils. This hypothesis has been previously tested with conflicting results.
      The aim of our study was to re-evaluate circulating neutrophil function in the
      absence of several possible confounding factors. To this end, we measured the
      respiratory burst of circulating neutrophils in response to two different stimuli
      by chemiluminescence in patients with active and inactive ulcerative colitis
      being off all medications. Our results show no significant difference between
      ulcerative colitis patients and controls in peak chemiluminescence,
      area-under-the-curve and time to peak comparisons. However, 27% of patients with 
      active ulcerative colitis had an abnormally elevated chemiluminescence to
      stimuli. In addition, no correlations were seen between disease activity and peak
      chemiluminescence. Thus circulating neutrophils in the majority of patients with 
      ulcerative colitis do not appear to be either "primed" or hyperactive. This may
      suggest the presence of local colonic factors that lead to neutrophil tissue
      infiltration and activation.

TI  - Therapeutic efficacy of cyclic home elemental enteral alimentation in Crohn's
      disease: Japanese cooperative Crohn's disease study.
PG  - 91-4
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) often flares up and requires frequent hospitalization and/or
      surgery. Cyclic home elemental enteral alimentation (C-HEEA) was developed to
      prevent flare-up of CD and to minimize patient hospitalization. However, its
      therapeutic efficacy has not been studied in a large patient population.
      Therefore, questionnaires were sent to members of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease 
      (IBD) Research Group of Japan to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of C-HEEA and 
      to define the factors that may affect the efficacy of the treatment. Data for 410
      patients (C-HEEA-treated n = 322; drug-treated n = 88) were collected from 29
      institutions and analysis showed the following results. The cumulative remission 
      and non-hospitalization rates of the C-HEEA treated group were significantly
      higher than the rates of the drug-treated group in all patients and in those with
      ileitis and ileo-colitis (P < 0.0001, P < 0.001, and P < 0.01, respectively), but
      no significant difference was noted in patients with colitis. Cumulative
      remission and non-hospitalization rates were also influenced by the daily calorie
      content of the elemental diet (ED); more than 1200 kcal of the ED per day was
      found to be more effective than lower amounts to maintain remission and to
      prevent hospitalization. The therapeutic efficacy of C-HEEA was shown to be
      superior to that of drug treatment in patients with CD with ileal involvement,
      and it is suggested that more than 1200kcal per day should be supplied by the ED 
      to enhance its therapeutic efficacy.

TI  - [A rare cause of severe diarrhea in children: pseudomembranous colitis].
PG  - 1081-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pseudomembranous colitis is a rare and serious complication of
      treatment by antibiotics. The case of a patient with a protracted
      pseudomembranous colitis followed by two relapses is reported. CASE REPORT: A 4
      year-old boy was admitted after 18 days of profuse and feverish diarrhea. He had 
      been given amoxycillin for 10 days, one and a half months previously. His
      temperature was 40 degrees C; he had abdominal pain and leucocytosis was
      30,000/mm3. The situation rapidly improved with digestive rest and i.v.
      antibiotic therapy. Relapse of diarrhea together with bilious vomiting and acute 
      abdominal pains required readmission three days after his discharge. Search for
      Clostridium difficile in stools remained negative. The diagnosis of
      pseudomembranous colitis was confirmed by sigmoidoscopy and intestinal biopsy.
      The patient was given parenteral nutrition for 3 weeks and vancomycin. The
      disease was complicated by anasarca related to severe protein-loosing enteropathy
      but evolution was finally favourable after a two month period. CONCLUSION:
      Pseudomembranous colitis remains a serious affection in childhood; its prognosis 
      largely depends on the precocity of diagnosis and treatment.

TI  - Effect of intervention in inflammatory bowel disease on health-related quality of
      life: a critical review.
PG  - 1147-61
AB  - UNLABELLED: Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is a quantitative measurement 
      of subjective perception of health state, including emotional and social aspects.
      It can be reliably measured with several valid instruments. Previous reviews of
      the literature suggested inadequate attention to HRQOL in studies of
      interventions in inflammatory bowel disease. PURPOSE: This study was undertaken
      to assess the current status of the quality of measurement of HRQOL in studies of
      inflammatory bowel disease and to review the clinical conclusions warranted by
      the literature. METHOD: Medicine was searched for articles relating to ulcerative
      colitis, Crohn's disease, or inflammatory bowel disease and quality of life since
      1981. The articles found were reviewed for citations of further articles. The
      adequacy of HRQOL measure was assessed and graded, and the study design was
      categorized to assess the strength of the literature on the whole. RESULTS: A
      trend was found toward higher quality of HRQOL measurement in the period 1988 to 
      1994 compared with 1981 to 1987. Most of the improvement was because of increased
      use of standardized and multidomain but unvalidated and unpublished
      questionnaires for measurement. CONCLUSIONS: Confidence in the following clinical
      conclusions in studies of surgical interventions in inflammatory bowel disease is
      limited by study design: that pelvic pouch is not inferior to ileostomy, that
      specific domains of HRQOL are differentially affected by different surgical
      procedures, and (with less confidence) that surgery is helpful in Crohn's
      disease. Medical studies have demonstrated that high quality HRQOL measures can
      be integrated into randomized, prospective trials. Clinically equivalent
      treatments have shown differential effects or HRQOL: 9 mg daily of budesonide is 
      superior to 15 mg, and hydrocortisone foam enemas are superior to prednisolone.
      Home parenteral nutrition has received modest support, limited again by study
      design. It is recommended that standard tests of HRQOL be used to increase
      comparability of studies and to increase the quality of this literature in
      general. In particular the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire, Rating Form 
      of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Concerns, and Direct Questioning of Objectives are 
      recommended.

TI  - Inflammatory diseases of the colon. Narrowing a wide field of symptoms and
      possible causes.
PG  - 46-8, 54, 57-8 passim
AB  - Symptoms and physical findings may indicate the severity of inflammatory disease 
      of the colon, but detailed history taking is needed to limit the wide spectrum of
      possible causes. Infectious causes should be ruled out before other disease is
      assumed to be present. No single test is sufficient to diagnose ulcerative
      colitis or Crohn's disease. Laboratory testing, histologic assessment, endoscopy,
      radiology, and bowel studies are often necessary in differential diagnosis.
      Because of the systemic nature of colitis, manifestations in the musculoskeletal,
      ocular, dermatologic, hepatobiliary, and other systems may occur and provide
      clues. Treatment depends on the type and severity of disease. Sulfasalazine
      (Azulfidine), sulfa-free 5-aminosalicylic acid compounds, and corticosteroids are
      mainstays of treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Supportive care
      and judicious use of antimicrobial therapy are usually effective in colitis due
      to bacterial, parasitic, and sexually transmitted infections and are useful for
      symptoms caused by colonic ischemia and vasculitis. Colitis resulting from
      radiation therapy may present several years after the procedure and can be
      difficult to diagnose and treat. In many cases of inflammatory colon disease,
      especially chronic conditions, consultation with a gastroenterologist is highly
      recommended.

TI  - The effect of treatment on lymphokine-secreting cells in the intestinal mucosa of
      children with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 547-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown both interleukin 2 (IL-2) and interferon
      gamma (IFN) to be elevated in patients with active Crohn's disease compared to
      ulcerative colitis or non-inflammatory bowel disease controls. However the effect
      of treatment on these lymphokines has not been studied. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
      Using a reverse haemolytic plaque assay the percentage of lymphokine-secreting
      cells was determined in the intestinal mucosa of children with Crohn's disease
      before and after 8 weeks of treatment with either enteral nutrition, cyclosporin 
      or steroids. RESULTS: Before treatment, a high percentage of cells isolated from 
      mucosal biopsies secreted IL-2 or interferon-gamma. Eight weeks' treatment with
      the immunosuppressive agents cyclosporin, or with corticosteroids, produced a
      significant reduction in the percentage of IL-2 secreting cells, although only
      for the former was there also a reduction in interferon-gamma secreting cells.
      Enteral nutrition however, produced a reduction in lymphokine-secreting cells
      equivalent to cyclosporin and produced the best histological and clinical
      improvement. CONCLUSION: Enteral nutrition and cyclosporin can down-regulate
      lymphokine secretion in the gut in Crohn's disease.

TI  - Cystic fibrosis-associated colitis and fibrosing colonopathy.
PG  - 565-70
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe our experience with cystic fibrosis (CF)-associated
      colitis and fibrosing colonopathy, and to assess treatment strategies. STUDY
      DESIGN: We reviewed hospital charts and autopsy reports of all University of
      Minnesota patients with CF between 1975 and August 1994. We identified six
      patients with colonopathy and compared them with a cohort of 79 patients with CF 
      in the same age range and seen during the same period. RESULTS: All patients with
      colonopathy had bloody diarrhea; five of the six had abdominal pain. Stool
      frequency and related symptoms distinguished the patients with colonopathy from
      the cohort population. All took a higher median dose of pancreatic enzymes than
      the cohort population during the 3 months preceding the onset of symptoms (p <
      0.002). For all six patients, barium studies revealed loss of haustration, and
      shortening and diffuse narrowing of the colonic lumen with relative rectal
      sparing. The distal ileal mucosa was irregular in four patients. A
      histopathologic study reveal fibrosis of the submucosa or lamina propria, and
      focal acute cryptitis in all six patients. Other features included ascites (2/6) 
      and nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver (1/6). One patient continues to
      have symptoms, three had subtotal colectomy, and the condition of two improved
      after a regimen including a low-fat diet, withholding of pancreatic enzymes, and 
      supplemental parenteral nutrition was initiated. CONCLUSIONS: Fibrosing
      colonopathy represents a newly recognized gastrointestinal complication of cystic
      fibrosis. Affected persons have taken larger doses of pancreatic enzymes than
      similar patients with cystic fibrosis, and have bloody diarrhea. We developed a
      medical protocol that may avoid surgical resection of the colon in some of these 
      patients.

TI  - Nutritional considerations in inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 597-611
AB  - Although many foods have been suggested to play a role in the cause of IBD, there
      are not yet definitive data to support diet as a cause of either CD or UC.
      Malnutrition is a common occurrence in IBD, and this must be considered in the
      treatment of these diseases. Nutritional support in IBD has limited use as
      primary therapy (Table 2). Even though parenteral and enteral nutrition have been
      associated with remission, relapse frequently occurs when normal food intake is
      resumed. Likewise, fistulae may resolve with aggressive, nutritional therapy, but
      they frequently recur with reinstitution of food. In short bowel syndrome caused 
      by extensive intestinal resection performed in CD, parenteral nutrition provides 
      an important mode of therapy. In addition, perioperative use of nutritional
      support may decrease the incidence of postoperative complications in patients who
      are malnourished. Nutritional support in pediatric patients with CD who have
      growth failure has been effective in stimulating growth.

TI  - Peripheral blood neutrophil responses in children with shigellosis.
PG  - 616-22
AB  - Alterations in peripheral blood neutrophil function are known to occur in
      patients with colitis and may have a role in precipitating nonspecific tissue
      injury. It is not known whether neutrophil function is altered in patients with
      Shigella dysenteriae type 1 infection, during which there is extensive colitis
      and which may be associated with life-threatening complications in young
      children. Three aspects of peripheral blood neutrophil function, polarization,
      attachment to yeast particles, and locomotion, were therefore studied in 111
      children with S. dysenteriae type 1 infection and 57 children without any
      infection. All children were aged 12 to 60 months. Of the children with S.
      dysenteriae type 1 infection, 42 had leukemoid reaction, hemolytic-uremic
      syndrome, or septicemia (complicated shigellosis), while the others did not
      (uncomplicated shigellosis). Polarization and locomotion in the absence of
      chemoattractants and in response to N-formylmethionyl-leucylphenylalanine (FMLP) 
      and the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of S. dysenteriae type 1 were determined.
      Attachment to unopsonized and opsonized yeast particles was also determined.
      Children with shigellosis (uncomplicated or complicated) had more polarized
      neutrophils with and without chemoattractants than uninfected children (P <
      0.05). Children with complicated shigellosis had more polarized neutrophils with 
      FMLP at 10(-7) and 10(-6) M (P < 0.05) and with LPS than children with
      uncomplicated shigellosis (P < 0.05). At 3 to 5 days after enrollment, the
      numbers of polarized neutrophils with 10(-8), 10(-6), and 10(-5) M FMLP declined 
      in children with uncomplicated shigellosis but not in those with complicated
      shigellosis. Attachment to yeast particles was similar in all three groups of
      children. Locomotion was inhibited by LPS in children with shigellosis (P <
      0.05), whether it was uncomplicated or complicated, compared with locomotion in
      uninfected children. Finally, neutrophil polarization in uninfected children was 
      negatively influenced by nutritional status. Thus, poorly nourished uninfected
      children had more polarized neutrophils with FMLP at 10(-9) M (P < = 0.02) and
      10(-5) M (P = 0.043) than their better-nourished counterparts. In summary,
      altered neutrophil responses are associated with both uncomplicated and
      complicated shigellosis.

TI  - Severe ulcerative colitis, dural sinus thrombosis, and the lupus anticoagulant.
PG  - 1514-7
AB  - Thromboembolic disease is a well-recognized but very uncommon complication of
      inflammatory bowel disease. The mechanisms of the increased risk of thrombosis
      are not well understood: although several coagulation abnormalities have been
      described in inflammatory bowel disease patients, it is not clear whether they
      actually contribute to hypercoagulation or whether they are nonspecific markers
      of inflammation. Antiphospholipid antibodies (anticardiolipin antibodies and/or
      lupus anticoagulant) have recently been associated with an increased risk of
      thrombosis, particularly cerebrovascular disease in young patients. We report the
      case of a 33-yr-old female with severe ulcerative colitis at first attack who
      developed thrombosis of the superior and inferior longitudinal dural sinuses. No 
      risk factors for thrombosis or coagulation abnormalities were observed; however, 
      lupus anticoagulant was detected in the serum. The patient was successfully
      treated with osmotic agents, prophylactic anticonvulsant, and antiplatelet
      therapy, combined with i.v. steroids. After 6 months, the colitis is in
      remission, and the neurological recovery is good even if not yet complete.

PG  - 762-5
AB  - CASE REPORT--A 15-year 6-month-old boy suffered from isolated recurrent rectal
      bleeding. Rectoscopy and colonoscopy allowed to identify and to excise one large 
      size villous polyp, which was the site of dysplasia and liberkuhn adenocarcinoma.
      Transrectal ultrasonography showed thickened mucosa and submucosa and suspect
      adenopathy. Proctectomy, ganglionic curage and coloanal anastomosis were then
      performed; one of the excised adenopathies was metastatic. The patient died
      twelve hours after surgery from an unexplained cardiovascular collapse.
      CONCLUSIONS--Unspecific symptoms of colorectal cancer explain that its diagnosis 
      is often delayed. Prognosis is poor related to the advanced stages at diagnosis
      and mucinous adenocarcinomas. Better knowledge of the clinical presentations and 
      of high risk situations as polyposis, ulcerative colitis, hereditary non
      polyposis colorectal cancer could improve the prognosis.

TI  - Undefined malabsorption syndrome with villous atrophy successfully reversed by
      treatment with cyclosporine.
PG  - 803-6
AB  - A 47-year-old man with a flat jejunal mucosa complicated by malabsorption,
      diarrhoea and lymphocytic colitis is presented. There was no response to gluten
      withdrawal alone, combination of a gluten-free diet and prednisone therapy, or
      total parenteral nutrition. Complete clinical remission was only achieved after
      simultaneous treatment with cyclosporine and a gluten-free diet. Rechallenge with
      a gluten-containing diet while cyclosporine treatment continued resulted in a
      relapse of diarrhoea and malabsorption. We conclude that cyclosporine may be an
      effective agent for the treatment of undefined, refractory forms of
      malabsorption.

TI  - Hyperammonemic coma due to parenteral nutrition in a woman with heterozygous
      ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency.
PG  - 282-4
AB  - Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency is an X-linked disorder of the urea cycle
      that can cause hyperammonemic encephalopathy in hemizygous males and heterozygous
      females. Affected females typically limit protein intake in their diet. This case
      report describes a 36-year-old woman with ulcerative colitis who went into
      hyperammonemic coma after administration of total parenteral nutrition. A similar
      episode of coma had occurred 7 years earlier after she delivered a normal boy.
      Heterozygous ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency was diagnosed based on a
      positive allopurinol tolerance test result after elevated levels of plasma
      glutamine and low plasma citrulline were detected. The protein load associated
      with parenteral alimentation resulted in symptomatic expression of this partial
      enzyme deficiency in this unique case. Partial ornithine transcarbamylase
      deficiency must always be considered in adult women and men with hyperammonemia
      who have normal liver function test results.

AB  - Since the early 1970s there has been considerable debate over the role of
      nutritional support in the treatment of patients with acute inflammatory bowel
      disease. The role of enteral feeding as a primary therapeutic option in patients 
      with acute Crohn's disease remains controversial. This article reviews the role
      of nutritional support both as an adjunct to standard medical therapy and as a
      primary therapeutic option.

TI  - Cyclosporine for the treatment of fulminant ulcerative colitis in children.
      Immediate response, long-term results, and impact on surgery.
PG  - 474-9
AB  - PURPOSE: Emergency surgery for fulminant colitis is often complicated by
      high-dose steroid therapy, poor nutrition, and psychologic maladjustment.
      Cyclosporine is effective for fulminant ulcerative colitis in adults, resulting
      in avoidance of immediate surgery in 75 percent of patients and a 55 percent
      long-term remission rate. Over the last five years, we studied the effectiveness 
      of cyclosporine in children with fulminant colitis. METHODS: Fourteen patients
      with ulcerative colitis (age, 7-20 years) received cyclosporine after satisfying 
      the following criteria: 1) greater than five bloody diarrheal stools per day; 2) 
      severe abdominal pain; 3) no improvement after ten days of bowel rest, 4)
      intravenous methylprednisolone (1-2 mg/kg/day); and 5) parenteral nutrition.
      Treatment was begun with oral cyclosporine (4.6-9.6 mg/kg/day), and the dose was 
      adjusted to achieve whole blood trough levels measured with a monoclonal
      radioimmunoassay between 150 and 300 ng/ml. If improved, patients were discharged
      on oral cyclosporine, prednisone, and a regular diet. RESULTS: Eleven of 14
      patients (78 percent) responded within two to nine days and were able to consume 
      a normal diet, had three or less soft stools per day, and had no pain. One did
      not respond after ten days and underwent an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis
      procedure. Two patients elected surgery after 20 days of therapy and a partial
      response. Of 11 patients who left the hospital, 4 had recurrent symptoms after 2 
      to 11 months of taking therapeutic doses of cyclosporine and 3 flare ups while
      weaning from cyclosporine after 4 to 8 months. Three patients have been weaned
      from cyclosporine after 8 to 13 months and have remained in remission from six
      months to five years. One patient is about to complete a six-month course of
      cyclosporine. Overall ten (72 percent) have undergone surgery, including 7 of 11 
      who responded initially to cyclosporine and left the hospital. Weight (P <
      0.001), albumin (P < 0.01), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P > 0.05), and
      prednisone dose (P < 0.001) improved significantly in the seven patients on
      cyclosporine who responded initially, left the hospital, and subsequently
      underwent surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Cyclosporine is effective in achieving clinical
      remission in 80 percent of children with refractory fulminant colitis; however,
      within one year, most initial responders will require colectomy because of a
      flare up of the disease. In a majority of patients, the role of cyclosporine
      therapy is to rapidly ameliorate symptoms and prevent precipitous colectomy,
      improve nutrition and psychologic adaptation, and reduce the steroid dose leading
      to surgery in a well-prepared patient.

PG  - 732-5
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The optimal timing of surgical intervention for severe ulcerative
      colitis remains uncertain. Numerous reports recommend surgery within 10-14 days
      if clinical remission is not achieved. We undertook a study to follow the
      clinical course and long-term follow-up of patients with severe ulcerative
      colitis treated medically for longer than 14 days (n = 11). METHODS: We performed
      a retrospective review of all patients admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis 
      of severe ulcerative colitis who were treated for more than 14 days. RESULTS:
      Nine percent of patients (n = 1) required surgery during their hospitalization.
      Ninety-one percent of patients (n = 10, mean age 8.6 yr, 7 M, 3 F) treated with
      medical and nutritional therapy for more than 14 days went into clinical
      remission. Of these, only 10% (n = 1) ultimately required surgery; 60% remain in 
      clinical remission up to 83 months posthospitalization (mean follow-up, 49.5
      months), whereas 30% suffer from mild to moderate colitis (mean follow-up, 26.3
      months). CONCLUSIONS: These results do not support the recommendation for
      colectomy for refractory severe ulcerative colitis if remission is not noted
      within 2 wk of hospitalization.

      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)].
PG  - 161-4
AB  - The objective of the present study is to evaluate the effects of peripheral
      parenteral nutrition (PNN) in a homogeneous group of patients who had not had
      surgery, and to determine whether the deterioration of the nutritional state can 
      be avoided while keeping the advantages of the administration of a peripheral
      route. We have included 7 patients (4 male and 3 female) with an acute episode of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Each received 1780 kcal/day (1500 non-protein
      kcal 66% as fats, and 33% as glucose), with a kcal/g of N ratio of 160 by means
      of the preparation technique of "all in one". The anthropometric parameters:
      initial and final weight (58.5 +/- 12 vs. 57.3 +/- 11); triceps skin fold (14.1
      +/- 4 vs. 14.1 +/- 4), and mean circumference of the arm (25.1 +/- 3 vs. 25.0 +/-
      3), did not give any significant differences during the treatment period. In the 
      biochemical data there were no significant differences either, except for the
      final level of serum albumin (3.44 +/- 0.28), which was significantly higher than
      the initial value (3.11 +/- 0.38) (p < 0.05). The mean duration of the treatment 
      was 12 days (range 6-18). There was no case of phlebitis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT

TI  - Intense nutritional support in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 843-52
AB  - The value of intense nutritional support in inflammatory bowel disease is still
      debated. Claims have been made that total enteral nutrition is as effective as
      total parental nutrition. In this review, the use of parenteral and enteral
      nutritional support as primary therapy in patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease has been critically evaluated. Most studies have been uncontrolled and
      nonrandomized with short-term follow-up. The literature does suggest, however,
      that intense nutritional support may have an adjunctive role to drug therapy in
      achieving remission in Crohn's disease, especially in corticosteroid-refractory
      patients. Nutritional support has a lesser role in chronic ulcerative colitis,
      except for assistance in pre- and postoperative management. The data do not
      support one variety of nutritional support over another, although enteral support
      should be used if possible, as it is less costly and potentially less
      complicated.

TI  - Safety of urgent restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis
      for fulminant colitis.
PG  - 345-9
AB  - PURPOSE: Subtotal colectomy with ileostomy is the operation of choice for
      patients with fulminant colitis. Restorative proctocolectomy (RPC) with ileal
      pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is preferred for patients who undergo elective
      surgery for ulcerative colitis. We retrospectively evaluated the safety of RPC
      with IPAA in patients with a moderate form of fulminant colitis. METHODS: A chart
      review of 737 patients who underwent RPC with IPAA for ulcerative and
      indeterminate colitis from 1983 through 1992 was performed. Moderate fulminant
      colitis was defined as acute disease requiring hospitalization and parenteral
      steroid therapy, but without hypotension (systolic blood pressure, < 100 mmHg),
      tachycardia (> 120 beats/min), or megacolon. RESULTS: Twelve patients with
      moderate fulminant colitis underwent urgent surgery (1.6 percent). They had been 
      treated preoperatively for 5.1 +/- 2.3 days with intravenous high-dose steroids, 
      total parenteral nutrition, and antibiotics. These patients had a shorter length 
      of disease (P = 0.01), lower hemoglobin, hematocrit, and albumin (P = 0.001), and
      higher temperature (P = 0.002) and leukocyte count (P = 0.007) than patients
      undergoing elective surgery. No early septic complications occurred, although
      perianal abscess occurred in one patient and pouch-anal fistula in another
      patient, 13 and 14 months after surgery, respectively. CONCLUSION: In carefully
      selected, hemodynamically stable patients with fulminant colitis and without
      megacolon, RPC with IPAA can be safely performed.

AB  - Malnutrition is common in inflammatory bowel disease; deficiencies of multiple
      micronutrients and macronutrients can present a diagnostic and therapeutic
      challenge to the clinician. Enteral and parenteral nutrition have been used as
      adjunctive therapy to correct or prevent malnutrition in inflammatory bowel
      disease. In addition, some authors have advocated enteral and parenteral
      nutrition as primary therapy of acute inflammatory bowel disease. The efficacy of
      these nutritional therapies in the management of Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis is reviewed.

PG  - 276-82
AB  - The relationship between physical activity and risk of symptomatic diverticular
      disease has not been investigated directly. This association was examined in a
      prospective cohort of 47,678 American men, 40 to 75 years of age, and free of
      diagnosed diverticular disease, colon or rectal polyp, ulcerative colitis, and
      cancer before 1988. During four years of follow up, 382 newly diagnosed cases of 
      symptomatic diverticular disease were documented. After adjustment for age,
      energy adjusted dietary fibre, and energy adjusted total fat, overall physical
      activity was inversely associated with the risk of symptomatic diverticular
      disease (for highest versus lowest extremes, relative risk (RR) = 0.63 (95%
      confidence interval (CI) 0.45, 0.88). Most of the inverse association was
      attributable to vigorous activity, for extreme categories RR = 0.60 (95% CI 0.41,
      0.87). For activity that was not vigorous the RR was 0.93 (95% CI 0.67, 1.69).
      Several specific activities were inversely associated with the risk of
      diverticular disease, but jogging and running combined was the only individual
      activity that was statistically significant (p for trend = 0.03). For men in the 
      lowest quintile for dietary fibre intake and total physical activity (compared
      with those in the opposite extreme), the RR was 2.56 (95% CI 1.36, 4.82).
      Physical activity, along with a high fibre diet, may be an important factor in
      the prevention of symptomatic diverticular disease.

TI  - [Development of Wernicke's encephalopathy during the period of oral food intake
      after a subtotal colectomy for ulcerative colitis].
PG  - 169-74
AB  - A 61-year-old woman was hospitalized because of ulcerative colitis which had
      caused fever, vomiting and diarrhea since June 16, 1992. Then she developed toxic
      megacolon, and was transferred to our hospital on the 1st of July and underwent
      subtotal colectomy the same day. After surgery, she received intravenous
      hyperalimentation (IVH) which contained 1,000 Kcal/day without vitamin
      supplementation. From the 8th to the 13th post-operative days, she took 3/4 or
      more of the liquid diet which contained 1,050 Kcal, protein 35 g, carbohydrate
      166 g and vitamin B1 0.59 mg per day. From the 14th to the 23rd post-operative
      days, she ate 4/5 or more of the oral diet which contained 1,700 Kcal/day,
      protein 68 g, carbohydrate 236 g and vitamin B1 0.93 mg per day. During the 7th
      to the 23rd day, the IVH was reduced to 800 Kcal and then 500 Kcal per day. She
      talked less on the 19th post-operative day, and in a few days, her level of
      consciousness began to decline progressively. On the 27th post-operative day,
      neurological examinations revealed the following: semi-coma, almost fixed pupils 
      which were 3 mm in diameter, absent doll's eye movement to all directions,
      flaccid extremities with abolished deep tendon reflexes. Pertinent abnormalities 
      on laboratory data at that time consisted of hemoglobin 7.8 g/dl and serum total 
      protein 5.4 g/dl. Lumbar puncture revealed normal cerebrospinal fluid under
      normal opening pressure. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) taken on the
      27th post-operative day demonstrated, on T2-weighted images, symmetrical high
      intensity lesions in the periventricular areas of the third and fourth
      ventricles, and periaqueductal area of the midbrain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

TI  - Constipation and incontinence in the elderly.
PG  - 61-70
AB  - We summarize the prevalence and causes of constipation and incontinence in an
      elderly, drawing particular attention to the roles of immobility, dietary fiber, 
      and dehydration. The physiology of fecal impaction is described in detail, and
      neurological and mechanical causes (rectal prolapse, rectocele, and hemorrhoids) 
      of constipation are discussed. Consideration is also given to constipation
      associated with diverticular disease and ulcerative colitis. We also discuss the 
      pathogenesis of fecal incontinence in the elderly, paying particular attention to
      fecal impaction and neurological causes that result in both constipation and
      incontinence. The importance of previous obstetric trauma and pudendal enuropathy
      is emphasized. We conclude with detailed guidelines of the clinical assessment
      and management of an elderly patient with a disorder of defecation.

TI  - Allergic gastroenteropathy in children.
PG  - 5-12; quiz 12-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the pathogenesis, symptoms, and treatment of
      gastrointestinal disorders linked to immunopathologic reactions associated with
      the ingestion of food antigens in infancy and childhood. DATA SOURCES: A
      computerized MEDLINE search was performed for the following topics: allergic
      colitis, allergic proctitis, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, eosinophilic colitis, 
      cow milk intolerance, protein losing enteropathy, and malabsorption. This search 
      was restricted to the English language and human subjects. Articles published
      between 1960 and 1993 were included as references. The textbooks which were used 
      as references include: (1) Walker WA, et al, eds. Pediatric gastrointestinal
      disease; pathophysiology, diagnosis, management, Philadelphia: BC Decker, 1991;
      (2) Wyllie R, et al, eds. Pediatric gastrointestinal disease; pathophysiology,
      diagnosis, management, Philadelphia: WB Saunders, 1993; (3) Targan SR, et al,
      eds. Immunology & immunopathology of liver and gastrointestinal tract.
      Igaku-Shoin, 1991; (4) Goldman H, et al, eds. Pathology of the gastrointestinal
      tract. Philadelphia: WB Saunders, 1992. CONCLUSION: The symptoms of allergic
      gastroenteropathy may be those of classic allergic reactions or present as
      symptom complexes that may include diarrhea, malabsorption, and protein-losing
      enteropathy. The immunopathogenesis of allergic gastroenteropathy is complex and 
      is still not clearly understood. As our understanding of the gastrointestinal
      mucosal system evolves, we should be able to manage and care for the infants and 
      children who suffer from this group of disorders better.

TI  - [What is the role of nutrition in ulcerative colitis? A contribution to the
      current status of diet therapy in treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases].
PG  - 4-11
AB  - Nutritional therapy for ulcerative colitis (UC) is controversial. Studies are
      usually designed to investigate total parenteral (TPN) or total enteral nutrition
      (TEN), and before these can be compared it is necessary to differentiate between 
      the different therapeutic aims. The aims of artificial nutritional support in
      patients with UC are the readjustment of the nutritional status, possible
      remission of disease activity, and decrease in the incidence of surgical
      intervention or postoperative complication. Owing to the heterogeneity of the
      results published so far, it is still difficult to compare studies. Nevertheless,
      they indicate that the extent and severity of the colitis and the patient
      selection are of paramount importance in the implementation of nutritional
      therapy. Positive effects of TPN reported from non-controlled studies were not
      confirmed by controlled trials. Moreover, TPN was no more effective than an oral 
      diet. Regarding remission rates or operative interventions needed, TPN had more
      side effects than and no defined advantages over TEN. TEN seems to be useful for 
      certain patients. In some patients with UC, it seems to be accompanied by fewer
      postoperative complications. However, a definitive conclusion on the effects of
      TEN or TPN is not yet possible. In this context, certain fatty acids may have an 
      important role in the treatment of UC. In prospective, randomized and controlled 
      studies omega-3 fatty acids were found to be therapeutically useful. A reduction 
      of the steroid doses needed is particularly important. Another therapeutic
      approach in distal UC is seen in the rectal administration of short chain fatty
      acids.
