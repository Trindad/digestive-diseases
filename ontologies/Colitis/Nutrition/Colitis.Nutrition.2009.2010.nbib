AB  - Soon after birth, the human gastrointestinal tract quickly becomes colonised by a
      variety of bacterial species. Throughout life the gastrointestinal tract
      continues to serve as host to a complex society of nonpathological bacteria.
      Microorganisms, such as probiotics, have the potential to modulate mucosal immune
      response and reduce gastrointestinal inflammation caused by a variety of
      infectious and allergic events. The most widely studied genera of probiotics are 
      lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. Lactobacillus rhamnosis strain ATC53103 (LGG)
      can replenish gut flora during infectious diarrhoeal episodes. This beneficial
      effect is carried over to traveller's diarrhoea and children experiencing
      antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Furthermore, LGG can reduce the risk of
      respiratory tract infections in children attending daycares and hospitals. With
      allergic disease on the rise, probiotics have the potential to positively impact 
      atopic dermatitis, asthma, and allergic rhinitis. LGG has been shown to decrease 
      the severity and delay the onset of atopic dermatitis. Additionally, LGG is
      beneficial in the treatment of allergic colitis and necrotising entercolitis.
      Some strains of probiotics appear to be useful in the treatment and/or prevention
      of allergic disease, however, caution must be used when generalising the
      effectiveness of a specific strain of organism to other organisms and other
      disease states.

TI  - Fecal osteoprotegerin may guide the introduction of second-line therapy in
      hospitalized children with ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1726-30
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21561 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is increased in inflamed colonic mucosa and has
      a role in immune regulation and apoptosis resistance. Fecal OPG may be useful in 
      predicting corticosteroid resistance in hospitalized children with severe
      ulcerative colitis (UC). We aimed to determine whether fecal OPG predicts the
      need for second-line therapies in children hospitalized for UC. METHODS: We
      included 83 children with UC admitted for intravenous corticosteroid treatment.
      Children were classified as responders/nonresponders based on the need for
      therapy escalation. Fecal OPG results were compared with those of four other
      fecal markers. RESULTS: Of the enrolled children, seven had day 1 samples only,
      53 children had day 3 samples only, and 23 had both. Twenty-two children failed
      corticosteroid therapy and required infliximab (n = 20) or colectomy (n = 2). On 
      the third treatment day the median fecal OPG levels were significantly higher in 
      the nonresponders group compared with the responders: 77 pmol/L (interquartile
      range [IQR] 27-137) versus 13 pmol/L (3-109); P = 0.007. The best day 3 fecal OPG
      cutoff to predict second-line therapy was >50 pmol/L with a sensitivity of 71%
      and specificity of 69% (area under the receiver operator curve [ROC] of 0.70%-95%
      confidence interval [CI] 0.57-0.82). Fecal OPG was superior to day 3 fecal
      calprotectin, lactoferrin, and S100A12 as a predictor of corticosteroid
      nonresponse, but equivalent to the less commonly used M2-pyruvate kinase.
      CONCLUSIONS: Day 3 fecal OPG may guide the decision to institute second-line
      therapy in children with severe UC. The role of OPG in the inflammatory response 
      in pediatric UC deserves further study.

TI  - Ability of commonly used prediction equations to predict resting energy
      expenditure in children with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1587-93
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21518 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Paediatric onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may cause
      alterations in energy requirements and invalidate the use of standard prediction 
      equations. Our aim was to evaluate four commonly used prediction equations for
      resting energy expenditure (REE) in children with IBD. METHODS: Sixty-three
      children had repeated measurements of REE as part of a longitudinal research
      study yielding a total of 243 measurements. These were compared with predicted
      REE from Schofield, Oxford, FAO/WHO/UNU, and Harris-Benedict equations using the 
      Bland-Altman method. RESULTS: Mean (+/-SD) age of the patients was 14.2 (2.4)
      years. Mean measured REE was 1566 (336) kcal per day compared with 1491 (236),
      1441 (255), 1481 (232), and 1435 (212) kcal per day calculated from Schofield,
      Oxford, FAO/WHO/UNU, and Harris-Benedict, respectively. While the Schofield
      equation demonstrated the least difference between measured and predicted REE,
      it, along with the other equations tested, did not perform uniformly across all
      subjects, indicating greater errors at either end of the spectrum of energy
      expenditure. Smaller differences were found for all prediction equations for
      Crohn's disease compared with ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Of the commonly
      used equations, the equation of Schofield should be used in pediatric patients
      with IBD when measured values are not able to be obtained.

TI  - Intracolonic infusion of fecal supernatants from ulcerative colitis patients
      triggers altered permeability and inflammation in mice: role of cathepsin G and
      protease-activated receptor-4.
PG  - 1409-14
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21454 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cathepsin G (Cat-G) is a neutrophil serine-protease found in the
      colonic lumen of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. Cat-G is able to activate
      protease-activated receptor-4 (PAR(4) ) located at the apical side of
      enterocytes, leading to epithelial barrier disruption. However, the mechanisms
      through which Cat-G triggers inflammation are not fully elucidated. The aims of
      our study were to evaluate in vivo the effects of UC fecal supernatants and Cat-G
      on epithelial barrier function and inflammation, and the connection between these
      two parameters. METHODS: Male balb/c mice were used in this study. We evaluated
      the effect of a 2-hour intracolonic infusion of 1) fecal supernatants from UC
      patients pretreated or not with specific Cat-G inhibitor (SCGI); 2) PAR(4)
      -activating peptide (PAR(4) -AP); and 3) Cat-G on colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO)
      activity and paracellular permeability (CPP). The involvement of PAR(4) was
      assessed by pretreating animals with pepducin P4pal-10, which blocks PAR(4)
      signaling. We investigated the role of myosin light chain (MLC) kinase by using
      its inhibitor, ML-7, and we determined phosphorylated MLC (pMLC) levels in mice
      colonic mucosa. RESULTS: UC fecal supernatants, Cat-G, and PAR(4) agonist
      increased both CPP and MPO activity in comparison with healthy subjects fecal
      supernatants. ML-7 inhibited the CPP increase triggered by Cat-G by 92.3%, and
      the enhanced MPO activity by 43.8%. Intracolonic infusion of UC fecal supernatant
      determined an increased phosphorylation level of MLC. CONCLUSIONS: These
      observations support that luminal factors such as Cat-G play an important
      proinflammatory role in the pathogenesis of colitis, mainly depending on CPP
      increase by MLC phosphorylation.

PG  - 971-83
LID - S0212-16112010000600013 [pii]
AB  - UNLABELLED: A quasi-experimental clinical assay was carried out to assess the
      tolerance, safety and usefulness of a 4 lactobacili + 1 bifidobacterium
      combination as adjuvant to the pharmacological treatment of UC Ulcerative colitis
      patients differing in mucosal change. The effectiveness of the probiotic
      treatment was assessed from changes in patient's stool pattern, body composition,
      and selected biochemical indicators of disease activity and nutritional status.
      Fifty patients entered consecutively in the trial between December 2005-June 2009
      (CONTROL GROUP: 29; Treatment Group: 21). Twenty of them completed treatment with
      probiotics. Effectiveness of regular pharmacological treatment was recorded with 
      24 control patients. Thirty-six days of probiotic treatment per patient were
      accumulated. Probiotic treatment obedience rate was 99.3%. Five days of treatment
      were lost due to non-availability of the product. No adverse reactions were
      reported after probiotic treatment. Two deaths were recorded after completion of 
      the study, one on each group. Improvement in the quality of the stools [RR
      Relative risk: 1.69; 95% IC: 0.87-3.27]; frequency [RR: 1.35; 95% IC:
      0.15-11.90]; and volume [RR: 1.11; 95% IC: 0.16-7.63] was observed in treated
      patients, although biological variability prevented these trends to become
      statistically significant. Probiotic treatment also resulted in reduction of
      occurrence of nocturnal depositions [RR: 1.75; 95% IC: 0.53-5.73]. Probiotic
      treatment prevented the onset of undesirable changes in stool pattern of treated 
      patients who presented free of symptoms, but observed effect was no superior to
      that of medication administered. Probiotic treatment did not influence upon
      presence of blood in stools. Probiotic treatment also resulted in reduction of
      disease activity and ESR Erythro-sedimentation rate, respectively [Change in the 
      Clinical Activity Index: CONTROL GROUP: -1.1 +/- 3.2 vs. Treatment Group: -4.1
      +/- 3.3; p < 0.05; Change in ESR: CONTROL GROUP: 3.6 +/- 16.4 vs. Treatment
      Group: -6.7 +/- 15.6; p < 0.05]. Adjuvant probiotic treatment resulted in
      increase of body weight, at the expenses of increase of MAMC Mid-arm Muscle
      Circumference and sum of skinfolds. Probiotic effect upon body weight was not
      attributed to increased food intakes in treated patients. In spite of clinical
      heterogeneity associated to mucosal damage in UC, probiotic treatment might
      result in beneficial effects upon patient's stool pattern, body composition, and 
      selected biochemical indicators of disease activity. Invariance of food intakes
      could imply that observed changes in response variables were not the result of a 
      placebo effect of used probiotic combination.

AB  - Thromboembolic events are one of the important extraintestinal manifestations of 
      inflammatory bowel diseases that are associated with considerable morbidity and
      mortality. Iliac vein thrombosis is rarely reported in inflammatory bowel
      diseases. A 9.5 year-old girl was presented with joint pain, nausea, vomiting and
      weight loss. She was diagnosed with Crohn's disease and right internal iliac vein
      thrombosis. With the implementation of immunosuppressive and anticoagulant
      therapies clinical picture has improved and thrombosis has resolved. Timely
      diagnosis and early treatment of extraintestinal complications of inflammatory
      bowel diseases might be lifesaving.

AB  - Thiopurines represent an effective and widely used immunosuppressant in the
      therapeutic armamentarium of inflammatory bowel disease. However up to 25% of
      patients may be unable to continue the drug due to side effects. The incidence of
      hepatotoxicity associated with thiopurine use is reported between 0% and 32%.
      Veno-occlusive disease, peliosis hepatis, perisinusoidal fibrosis and nodular
      regenerative hyperplasia have all been described with thiopurines. Recent trials 
      of 6-tioguanine, although successful in patients with allergies to azathioprine
      or mercaptopurine, have been compromised by increased hepatotoxicity, either
      veno-occlusive disease or nodular regenerative hyperplasia. We describe a report 
      of nodular regenerative hyperplasia in a Crohn's disease patient associated with 
      6-mercaptopurine therapy and have reviewed the management and the literature
      regarding this complication. Our report strengthens the importance of further
      safety studies to evaluate the etiology, prevalence, risk factors and screening
      modalities for hepatotoxicity, in particular of nodular regenerative hyperplasia,
      in patients treated with thiopurines for inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Steroid response in moderate to severe pediatric ulcerative colitis: a single
      center's experience.
PG  - 50-3
LID - 10.1007/s12519-011-0245-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: we aimed to analyze clinical and inflammatory markers of steroid
      non-response in patients with moderate/severe ulcerative colitis (UC) at the time
      of diagnosis. METHODS: this study included patients who were graded as having
      moderate/severe UC and received corticosteroids as first-line therapy.
      Demographic, clinical and laboratory findings and pediatric ulcerative colitis
      activity scores (PUCAS) were recorded. Response to corticosteroids was assessed
      30 days after the induction and long-term therapy. RESULTS: twenty-eight children
      were diagnosed as having moderate/severe UC. Their mean age +/- SD was 1 2.2 +/- 
      4 years, and 17% were under 5 years of age. PUCAS at their initial admission was 
      56.9 +/- 11.8. UC was observed at the left colon in 9 patients (32.1%), and
      pancolitis in 19 (67.9%). At the end of the 30th day, UC was completely remitted 
      in 15 patients (53.5%), partially remitted in 2 (7.1%), and no response in 11
      (39.2%). Short-term follow-up showed partial remission in 2 patients, and overall
      remission with steroid in 17 (60.7%). Non-responders were given second-line
      treatment; steroid dependency was documented in 2 patients (7.1%) and another 2
      (7.1%) patients underwent colectomy. Predictors for steroid non-response were
      analyzed and only PUCAS at the initial admission was found to be associated with 
      non-response to steroids (51.4 +/- 11.4 vs. 65.4 +/- 6.8, P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS:
      approximately half of the pediatric patients had complete response to steroid
      therapy in a long period. PUCAS could be used as a potential marker of "failed
      response" to steroid, but should be supported with a number of prospective
      randomized controlled studies.

TI  - Octreotide for symptomatic treatment of diarrhea due to cytomegalovirus colitis.
PG  - e4
LID - 10.1345/aph.1P375 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report the improvement of diarrhea in a patient with
      cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis who was treated with octreotide after failure of
      loperamide. CASE SUMMARY: An 84-year-old male presented with chronic diarrhea and
      CMV colitis; he had been experiencing protracted diarrhea since 2006. In October 
      2009 he failed a 21-day course of valgancyclovir 900 mg orally twice daily.
      Several months later, due to continuing diarrhea and progressive malnutrition, a 
      colonoscopy and subsequent biopsy again showed CMV. In March 2010 he was started 
      on a 28-day course of intravenous ganciclovir 130 mg daily. Three weeks into
      treatment he continued with copious amounts of diarrhea, with no relief from
      loperamide, which was titrated from 2 mg/day to 2 mg every 6 hours. On day 20 of 
      ganciclovir treatment he was started on octreotide 50 mug subcutaneously every 8 
      hours; within a few days, the patient began to experience decreased stool
      frequency and consistency. He completed the full 28-day course of ganciclovir,
      with octreotide continuing unchanged, with much improvement in his diarrheal
      symptoms and improvement in appetite, nutritional status, and quality of life.
      DISCUSSION: Studies regarding the treatment of CMV colitis-associated diarrhea
      are scarce, and are typically limited to treating the underlying cause with
      antiviral medications and with the addition of antimotility agents. Three cases
      have been reported in the literature in which octreotide was used for the
      symptomatic treatment of diarrhea, none of which was refractory to loperamide.
      CONCLUSIONS: This is the first known case of a patient with chronic diarrhea due 
      to CMV colitis that was unresponsive to loperamide, required protracted antiviral
      treatment (valgancyclovir and gancyclovir), and subsequently experienced relief
      by the use of octreotide 50 mug subcutaneously every 8 hours.

TI  - E durans strain M4-5 isolated from human colonic flora attenuates intestinal
      inflammation.
PG  - 1676-86
LID - 10.1007/DCR.0b013e3181f4b148 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro and in vivo effects of a 
      unique high-butyrate-producing bacterial strain from human colonic flora,
      Enterococcus durans, in prevention and treatment of intestinal inflammation.
      METHODS: A compartmentalized Caco-2/leukocyte coculture model was used to examine
      the in vitro effects of E durans and its metabolite butyrate on basal and
      Escherichia coli-stimulated secretion of proinflammatory immune factors (IL-8,
      IL-6, and TNF-alpha) and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. A murine model of 
      dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis was used to examine in vivo effects of
      prevention and therapy with E durans on clinical, biochemical, and histologic
      parameters of inflammation. RESULTS: In the coculture model, treatment with E
      durans and with butyrate reduced basal as well as E coli stimulated secretion of 
      IL-8, IL-6, and TNF-alpha and increased secretion of IL-10. In the in vivo murine
      model, preventive administration of E durans significantly ameliorated clinical
      disease activity index (weight loss, fecal bleeding, and stool consistency),
      reduced myeloperoxidase concentration in colon tissue extracts, improved
      histologic scores of colonic inflammation, and inhibited colonic transcription of
      proinflammatory immune factors. The effect of therapeutic treatment alone on
      these parameters was more moderate but still significant. CONCLUSIONS: We
      conclude that E durans strain M4 to 5 and its metabolic product butyrate induce
      significant anti-inflammatory effects, mediated by regulation of pro- and
      anti-inflammatory immune factors as well as preservation of intestine epithelial 
      integrity, suggesting that this novel anti-inflammatory bacterium may be
      preferentially a useful prophylactic treatment to avoid inflammatory bowel
      disease.

TI  - Teduglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-2 analog for the treatment of
      gastrointestinal diseases, including short bowel syndrome.
PG  - 798-809
AB  - Glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) is a potent intestinotrophic growth factor with
      therapeutic potential for the prevention or treatment of an expanding number of
      gastrointestinal diseases, including short bowel syndrome (SBS). Teduglutide,
      being developed by NPS Allelix and licensee Nycomed, is a protease-resistant
      analog of GLP-2 for the potential treatment of gastrointestinal disease.
      Teduglutide has prolonged biological activity compared with native GLP-2, and
      preclinical studies demonstrated significant intestinotrophic activity in models 
      of SBS, experimental colitis and chemotherapy-induced intestinal mucositis.
      Patients with SBS rely on parenteral nutrition (PN) following bowel resection,
      and in a phase III clinical trial with teduglutide, > 20% reduction in PN was
      observed in patients with SBS receiving teduglutide. A phase II clinical trial
      for teduglutide in Crohn's disease observed remission rates of 55.6% in patients.
      At the time of publication, phase III clinical trials for SBS were ongoing, as
      were preclinical studies for chemotherapy-induced mucositis and pediatric
      indications. Teduglutide represents a novel, efficacious drug capable of
      increasing intestinal growth and improving intestinal function, and may change
      clinical management of intestinal disease and damage.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Up to one-third of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) do 
      not respond to, or are intolerant of conventional immunosuppressive drugs.
      Although biological agents are alternative treatments, they may not be suitable
      or available to some patients. AIM: To review the evidence for use of
      nonbiological drugs in the treatment of patients with IBD refractory to
      corticosteroids or thiopurines. METHODS: A literature search was performed using 
      PubMed for English language publications with predetermined search criteria to
      identify relevant studies. RESULTS: Published evidence from uncontrolled series
      and controlled clinical trials has been used to produce a practical approach
      relevant to clinical practice which incorporates the indication, optimal dose,
      and side effects of various therapies including tacrolimus, methotrexate,
      thalidomide, tioguanine, mycophenolate mofotil, leucocyte apheresis, nutritional 
      therapy, antibiotics, probiotics, allopurinol, rectal acetarsol and ciclosporin
      in the treatment of patients with refractory ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
      disease. Approaches to optimise thiopurine efficacy are also discussed.
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD refractory to corticosteroids or thiopurines may
      respond to alternative anti-inflammatory chemical molecules, but the evidence
      base for many of these alternatives is limited and further trials are needed.

PG  - 3668-83
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory disorder
      of the gastrointestinal tract and is broadly classified into Crohn's disease (CD)
      and ulcerative colitis (UC). In the last decade, our understanding of the
      etiology and pathogenesis of this group of disorders has been improved. More
      specifically, recent development of biologics and use of immunomodulator agents
      in IBD have made it possible to robustly control mucosal inflammation and heal
      mucosal ulcerations and thus provide an opportunity to potentially modify disease
      course and prevent complications and future surgery. However, unfortunately we
      have not identified reliable, sensitive and specific markers to predict disease
      course and to identify those patients with aggressive and progressive course that
      would benefit from early use of biologics to prevent future complication and
      surgery. Thus, optimal medical management of IBD has remained multifaceted and
      individualized. Our primary therapeutic goals have remained unchanged and are to:
      [1] improve patient quality of life by treating flare ups [induction of
      remission], maintaining remission, and treating symptoms like diarrhea; [2]
      predict and prevent/treat complication; [3] prevent/treat nutritional deficiency 
      and maintain optimal nutrition, [4] provide appropriate psychosocial support, and
      of course [5] attempt to modify disease course in those with aggressive disease. 
      We can achieve these goals by appropriate use of therapeutic agents that include 
      5-aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, antibiotics,
      nutritional support, and the biologic agents. Information from well designed
      double blind placebo controlled trials combined with knowledge of the potential
      impact of patient and disease characteristics on disease course which can assist 
      us to individualized treatment plan will be the guide for us to appropriately use
      these therapeutic agents. For example, age of the onset of the disease, patient
      gender and race, mode of the disease presentation, disease location,
      disease-associated complications such as perianal disease/fistula, and serology
      and genetic markers can all help to individualize disease treatment. These
      factors can help to determine whether one should start with
      5-ASA/antibiotic/steroid [step-up where there is no risk factors for aggressive
      disease course] or whether one should initiate biologic therapy at diagnosis
      [top-down approach], and whether it is most advisable to use monotherapy with
      biologic treatment [e.g. in young, Caucasian male or elderly] or use a
      combination therapy with a biologic and an immunomodulator. Ongoing research
      promises, in a near future, development of more robust set of markers to be able 
      to model disease behavior to more accurately predict disease course and thus
      decide on therapeutic approach with most appropriate efficacy/risk ratio for a
      given patient. Furthermore, current basic laboratory research has provided a
      large number of potential therapeutic targets to treat IBD with new promising
      highly specific and targeted agents.

TI  - Dyslipidemia and lipoprotein profiles in patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 478-82
LID - 10.1016/j.jacl.2010.08.021 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dyslipidemia is a major risk factor for developing coronary artery
      disease. An increase in inflammatory cytokines may result in a decrease in
      lipoprotein lipase (LPL) enzyme activity, leading to a characteristic lipoprotein
      profile with increased triglycerides and decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
      levels as seen in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Similar to
      SLE, patients with IBD have high circulatory levels of inflammatory cytokines.
      However, in these patients characteristic lipoprotein profiles have not been
      reported. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to identify and describe
      dyslipidemia and lipoprotein profiles in an IBD patient population. METHODS:
      Medical records of patients diagnosed with IBD (Crohn's disease [CD] and
      ulcerative colitis [UC]) at an academic medical center between 2000 and 2007 were
      retrospectively reviewed for lipoprotein lipid measurements, serum albumin
      levels, risk factors, and treatment to modify lipoprotein concentrations. The
      lipoprotein guidelines and risk factors are based on the Third Report of the
      National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and
      Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults. Only patients with documented IBD 
      diagnosis and lipoprotein profiles are included in the study. National Health and
      Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2006 population database was used for 
      control values. RESULTS: A total of 393 patients (152 men and 241 women)
      diagnosed with IBD (188 CD and 205 UC) who were not on statins qualified for the 
      study. Patients were grouped on the basis of gender (male and female) and IBD
      disease type (CD and UC). Compared with the male NHANES samples (with similar
      mean age and body mass index), total cholesterol and HDL-C were significantly
      lower and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides were
      significantly greater in male patients with IBD. In female patients with IBD, the
      mean values for total cholesterol, HDL-C, and triglycerides were significantly
      lower and LDL-C significantly greater compared with the female NHANES samples.
      CONCLUSION: Given low levels of HDL-C and increased levels of LDL-C, a more
      aggressive approach in profiling and treating dyslipidemia seems warranted in
      patients with IBD.

AB  - Gastrointestinal symptoms occurring in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) can be 
      related to disease activity or to intercurrent infection. Absence of appropriate 
      stool work-up can lead to misdiagnosis and wrong treatment. We report here two
      cases of acute cryptosporidiosis in patients with CD. This microorganism can
      trigger IBD flare or cause severe infections in immunocompromised host. Adding
      specific search for oocysts of Cryptosporidium parvum using the Ziehl-Neelsen
      technique to the microbiologic work-up from stools in patients with Crohn's
      disease seeking medical intervention for sudden exacerbation of digestive
      symptoms seems to be recommended.

TI  - Long-term efficacy of adalimumab in paediatric Crohn's disease patients naive to 
      other anti-TNF therapies.
PG  - 594-8
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2010.04.002 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Adalimumab is a fully-humanized anti-TNF a antibody that has showed
      its efficacy in Crohn's disease (CD) adult patients. Its less immunogenic
      composition seems to be an advantage compared to previous anti-TNF alpha, mainly 
      infliximab. Good response to adalimumab has been reported in patients naive to
      infliximab, in those in whom infliximab has shown no efficacy and in those
      intolerant or who have lost previous response to it. Adalimumab has shown also
      its efficacy as a second-line anti-TNF alpha in small series of paediatric CD but
      data regarding its use in children naive to infliximab are scarce. AIM: To report
      our experience with adalimumab as first line anti-TNF alpha treatment in
      paediatric CD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four CD paediatric patients (2 boys)
      previously naive to infliximab have received adalimumab. Mean age at diagnosis:
      13 years, 4 months. Adalimumab was initiated in our patients soon after diagnosis
      (mean time from diagnosis: 8.5 months, range: 1 month 15 days-14 months) at
      decreasing loading doses (160 mg and 80 mg two weeks after) and then 40 mg
      subsequently every two weeks. RESULTS: The four patients entered in remission
      after the first dose of adalimumab (mean previous PCDAI: 35, mean PCDAI after
      first dose: 3.6). No adverse effects were registered. Azathioprine was stopped
      after 4 months of combination therapy, without loss of efficacy or adverse
      reactions attributable to immunogenicity. All the 4 patients have remained in
      remission on adalimumab monotherapy for a mean follow-up of 17 months (range 9-20
      months). CONCLUSION: Adalimumab has shown its efficacy in our paediatric CD
      patients naive to other anti-TNF alpha drugs. Early introduction of anti-TNF
      alpha antibodies in these patients could help to a better control of the disease.
      Its less immunogenicity and the possibility of a home-based administration are
      advantages when compared to other parenteral anti-TNF treatments. Change to
      monotherapy after prior successful combination therapy with azathioprine and
      adalimumab is a safe strategy that can help to minimize possible risks of
      intensive immunomodulation.

AB  - Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare, potentially fatal, severe
      condition of hyperinflammation caused by the uncontrolled proliferation of
      activated lymphocytes and histiocytes secreting high amounts of inflammatory
      cytokines. Here we report a fatal hemophagocytic syndrome in a 11-year-old boy
      with a diagnosis of both Crohn's disease receiving immunosuppressive therapy and 
      familial Mediterranean fever. It is important to evaluate the patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease receiving immunosuppressive therapy presenting with
      unexplained fever, cytopenia, progression of organomegaly and biochemical changes
      for the investigation of HLH for diagnosis and treatment.

PG  - 203-6
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2009.11.006 [doi]
AB  - Fournier gangrene is a very rare and a rapidly progressing, polymicrobial
      necrotizing faciitis or myonecrosis of the perineal, perianal and genital
      regions, with a high mortality rate. Infection is associated with superficial
      traum, urological and colorectal diseases and operations. The most commonly found
      bacteria are Escherichia coli followed by Bacteroides and streptococcal species. 
      Diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, and immunosuppression are perpetuating co-factors.
      Fournier's gangrene complicating inflammatory bowel disease has been reported in 
      three patients so far, two with Crohn's disease. A 78-year-old man diagnosed with
      ulcerative pancolitis was referred for fever, and painful perianal and scrotal
      swelling after perianal surgery for a horseshoe-type perianal abscess. Since
      bowel disease diagnosis, patient was on mesalazine and achieved long-term
      remission. Perianal abscess occurred suddenly one week before perianal surgery
      without any evidence of pre-existing fistula or other abnormalities. Physical
      examination showed extensive edema and crepitus of perineum and genitalia and
      patient had symptoms of significant toxicity. The diagnosis of Fournier's
      gangrene was made and patient underwent emergency surgery with extensive surgical
      debridement of the scrotal and perianal area and Hartman procedure with a
      diverting colostomy. In addition, patient started on therapy with mesalazine 3gr,
      methylprednisolone 16 mg, parenteral nutrition and broad spectrum of antibiotics.
      Two days after the first operation the patient needed a second operation for
      perianal debridement. On the fourth day, blood cultures showed E. coli. Patient
      had an uneventful recovery and was discharged after 34 days of hospitalization.
      On follow up, disease review is scheduled and colostomy closure is planned.

AB  - Crohn's disease is extremely rare in infancy and can be present in severe forms. 
      Infants with Crohn's disease might require intensive immunosuppressive therapy.
      Infliximab is a chimeric mouse/human monoclonal IgG1 antibody against tumor
      necrosis factor-alpha, and completely neutralizes its biologic activity. Though
      widely used in the treatment of pediatric Crohn's disease, there are few data
      regarding its applicability in infancy. We therefore report herein our
      experiences with infliximab therapy in two infantile patients with Crohn's
      disease who were resistant to conventional therapies; one patient showed a
      partial response while there was no response in the second. We were unable to
      achieve satisfactory results from infliximab therapy. It remains to be determined
      whether inflammatory bowel disease starting in infancy represents a separate
      pathogenetic subgroup and whether the inflammatory bowel disease diagnosis should
      follow the exclusion of an immunodeficiency state. Studies in larger series are
      needed to further clarify the efficacy, safety and timing of infliximab therapy
      for infantile Crohn's disease patients.

AB  - This clinical report reviews the currently known health benefits of probiotic and
      prebiotic products, including those added to commercially available infant
      formula and other food products for use in children. Probiotics are supplements
      or foods that contain viable microorganisms that cause alterations of the
      microflora of the host. Use of probiotics has been shown to be modestly effective
      in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in (1) treating acute viral gastroenteritis 
      in healthy children; and (2) preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea in healthy
      children. There is some evidence that probiotics prevent necrotizing
      enterocolitis in very low birth weight infants (birth weight between 1000 and
      1500 g), but more studies are needed. The results of RCTs in which probiotics
      were used to treat childhood Helicobacter pylori gastritis, irritable bowel
      syndrome, chronic ulcerative colitis, and infantile colic, as well as in
      preventing childhood atopy, although encouraging, are preliminary and require
      further confirmation. Probiotics have not been proven to be beneficial in
      treating or preventing human cancers or in treating children with Crohn disease. 
      There are also safety concerns with the use of probiotics in infants and children
      who are immunocompromised, chronically debilitated, or seriously ill with
      indwelling medical devices. Prebiotics are supplements or foods that contain a
      nondigestible food ingredient that selectively stimulates the favorable growth
      and/or activity of indigenous probiotic bacteria. Human milk contains substantial
      quantities of prebiotics. There is a paucity of RCTs examining prebiotics in
      children, although there may be some long-term benefit of prebiotics for the
      prevention of atopic eczema and common infections in healthy infants.
      Confirmatory well-designed clinical research studies are necessary.

AB  - Surgery for chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasingly often
      necessary in children. This study aimed at assessing the results of these
      operations in order to facilitate adequate preoperative counseling. We reviewed
      patients treated from 1992 to 2009. The operations, complications and functional 
      outcome were recorded. For those with preserved rectal defecation, continence
      (Koivusalo score) and quality of life (standardized questionnaire) were assessed 
      in the long term. Eighty five of 192 patients had Crohn disease (CD), 107 of 192 
      had ulcerative colitis (UC), and 3 of 192 had indeterminate colitis (IC). 12 of
      85 CD patients (15%) aged 14 (12-19) years required 13 resections, 1
      stricturoplasty, 1 transplantation and 6 other operations including 3 permanent
      enterostomies for anorectal involvement. Removal of the involved bowel led to
      significant improvement of nutritional status, growth and quality of life. The
      transplanted patient had a striking recovery but eventually died 1 year later of 
      unrelated complications. 29 of 107 UC patients (26%) aged 11 (2-15) years
      required 87 operations. Nine had emergency colectomy for toxic megacolon (3, one 
      death) or severe hemorrhage (6). 28 had restorative proctocolectomy and
      ileoanostomy (RPCIA) without (16) or with (12) J-pouch under protective
      ileostomy. Complications were frequent (40%). Permanent ileostomy was required in
      five children (17%). Twelve months postoperatively, RPCIA patients had 6.5 (2-13)
      stools/day; all were continent during daytime, and 25% have nocturnal leaks. Mean
      Koivusalo score (5-12) was 8.8 +/- 2. Quality of life was good in all. All
      attended normal school and 7 the university, 4 work and 60% of those older than
      18 years have sexual partners. Three of 107 children treated as UC with RPCIA had
      ultimately IC (3%) and were permanently diverted. The nature of IBD involves
      frustrating surgery. However, it may change life for CD patients and provide a
      reasonably good quality of life for UC after the first year. Pediatric surgeons
      should be able to provide adequate preoperative counseling to patients and
      families.

PG  - G191-201

AB  - Chronic inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) affect 
      bone metabolism and are frequently associated with the presence of osteopenia,
      osteoporosis, and increased risk of fractures. Although several mechanisms may
      contribute to skeletal abnormalities in IBD patients, inflammation and
      inflammatory mediators such as TNF, IL-1beta, and IL-6 may be the most critical. 
      It is not clear whether the changes in bone metabolism leading to decreased
      mineral density are the result of decreased bone formation, increased bone
      resorption, or both, with varying results reported in experimental models of IBD 
      and in pediatric and adult IBD patients. New data, including our own, challenge
      the conventional views, and contributes to the unraveling of an increasingly
      complex network of interactions leading to the inflammation-associated bone loss.
      Since nutritional interventions (dietary calcium and vitamin D supplementation)
      are of limited efficacy in IBD patients, understanding the pathophysiology of
      osteopenia and osteoporosis in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis is critical
      for the correct choice of available treatments or the development of new targeted
      therapies. In this review, we discuss current concepts explaining the effects of 
      inflammation, inflammatory mediators and their signaling effectors on calcium and
      phosphate homeostasis, osteoblast and osteoclast function, and the potential
      limitations of vitamin D used as an immunomodulator and anabolic hormone in IBD.

      pro-inflammatory responses in mouse experimental colitis.
PG  - 133
LID - 10.1186/1471-230X-10-133 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serum Amyloid A (SAA) is a major acute phase protein of unknown
      function. SAA is mostly expressed in the liver, but also in other tissues
      including the intestinal epithelium. SAA reportedly has anti-bacterial effects,
      and because inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) result from a breakdown in
      homeostatic interactions between intestinal epithelia and bacteria, we
      hypothesized that SAA is protective during experimental colitis. METHODS:
      Intestinal SAA expression was measured in mouse and human samples. Dextran sodium
      sulfate (DSS) colitis was induced in SAA 1/2 double knockout (DKO) mice and in
      wildtype controls. Anti-bacterial effects of SAA1/2 were tested in intestinal
      epithelial cell lines transduced with adenoviral vectors encoding the CE/J SAA
      isoform or control vectors prior to exposure to live Escherichia coli. RESULTS:
      Significant levels of SAA1/SAA2 RNA and SAA protein were detected by in situ
      hybridization and immunohistochemistry in mouse colonic epithelium. SAA3
      expression was weaker, but similarly distributed. SAA1/2 RNA was present in the
      ileum and colon of conventional mice and in the colon of germfree mice.
      Expression of SAA3 was strongly regulated by bacterial lipopolysaccharides in
      cultured epithelial cell lines, whereas SAA1/2 expression was constitutive and
      not LPS inducible. Overexpression of SAA1/2 in cultured epithelial cell lines
      reduced the viability of co-cultured E. coli. This might partially explain the
      observed increase in susceptibility of DKO mice to DSS colitis. SAA1/2 expression
      was increased in colon samples obtained from Crohn's Disease patients compared to
      controls. CONCLUSIONS: Intestinal epithelial SAA displays bactericidal properties
      in vitro and could play a protective role in experimental mouse colitis. Altered 
      expression of SAA in intestinal biopsies from Crohn's Disease patients suggests
      that SAA is involved in the disease process..

      5.2 years. We found a high prevalence of abnormal function livers tests in 40% of
      UC patients. The pattern of abnormal function liver test was hepatitis in 70%,
      cholestatic (20%) and mixed (10%). The most common cause of abnormal function
      liver test was transient elevation in 50 patients (63%) followed by fatty liver
      disease (11.2%), primary sclerosing cholangitis (6.3%), drug-toxicity (6%) and
      others (13.5%) including chronic hepatitis C, total parenteral nutrition,
      granulomatous and ischemic hepatitis. In the multivariate logistic regression
      model, active disease, colectomy and abdominal sepsis were factors that persisted
      associated with the development of abnormal liver tests in UC patients.
      CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of abnormal function liver tests (40%) was found in
      Mexican UC patients is likely to be related to active disease, colectomy and the 
      presence of sepsis.

AB  - The United States spends more for healthcare than any other country in the world.
      With the rising prevalence of both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis,
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents the leading chronic gastrointestinal 
      disease with increasing healthcare expenditures in the US. IBD costs have shifted
      from inpatient to outpatient care since the introduction of biologic therapies as
      the standard of care. Gastroenterologists need to be aware of the national cost
      burden of IBD and clinical practices that optimize cost-efficiency. This
      investigation offers a systematic review of the economics of IBD and
      evidence-based strategies for cost-effective management.

PG  - A1899
AB  - The Dutch national practice guideline 'Diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory
      bowel diseases (IBD) in adults' describes the multidisciplinary approach for
      adult patients with (suspected) IBD, recommended following analysis of the
      literature according to the principles of evidence based guideline development.
      The symptoms on first presentation of a patient with IBD are mainly connected
      with the localisation and severity of the disease and less with the resulting
      diagnosis 'Crohn's disease' or 'ulcerative colitis'. There is no test by which
      the diseases can be distinguished with certainty. Clinical course,
      ileocolonoscopy and histopathological investigation following biopsy form the
      'gold standard' for diagnosis of IBD. The final diagnostic step is disease
      assessment according to the Montreal classification in order to enable
      unambiguous communication with medical professionals. The first aim of treatment 
      is to treat and stabilise active disease (induction therapy); at the same time
      maintenance therapy is initiated. A step-up approach is recommended for both
      treatment aims. Surgical intervention is indicated if the medical treatment is
      ineffective, in case of intractable gastrointestinal bleeding, in clinically
      significant gastrointestinal stenosis due to fibrotic scar tissue, or if
      complications of the inflammation occur such as abscess, peritonitis, or
      complicated fistula formation. Nutrition and diet do not play a primary
      therapeutic role in treatment of adult patients with IBD. However, supportive
      nutritional care is warranted. Probiotics have a demonstrable effect in
      preventing pouchitis, but not in the treatment of IBD. Alternative medicine has
      no role to play in the treatment of IBD. The risk of developing colorectal
      carcinoma is slightly elevated in IBD patients. Therefore, endoscopic
      surveillance strategies, aimed at early detection of dysplasia, is indicated
      according to a schedule in which the frequency increases according to the time
      elapsed since first clinical signs of IBD.

TI  - Oral budesonide for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - CD007698
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD007698.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Corticosteroids remain one of the most popular medication choices for
      the induction of remission in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. While
      corticosteroids may improve symptoms, they do not always result in mucosal
      healing and have significant adverse effects. Steroids which act topically, with 
      less systemic side-effects may be more desirable. Oral budesonide, a topically
      acting corticosteroid with extensive first pass hepatic metabolism, is effective 
      in Crohn's disease and in enema formulation for left-sided ulcerative colitis.
      Data are limited regarding the role of oral budesonide in ulcerative colitis.
      OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the safety and efficacy of oral budesonide
      for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis. SEARCH STRATEGY: Electronic
      searching of the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases was performed. Two authors
      independently reviewed all identified titles and abstracts. Full text articles of
      all potentially relevant studies were retrieved. Reference lists of review
      articles were searched in an attempt to identify additional studies. Abstracts of
      the major gastroenterology scientific meetings, held over the past 3 years, were 
      hand searched. The ClinicalTrials.gov website as well as the Cochrane Registry of
      Controlled Trials was searched to identify any ongoing trials. Direct
      communication with pharmaceutical manufacturers was established to identify any
      ongoing or unpublished studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials 
      of oral budesonide for the induction of remission in ulcerative colitis, with
      either a parallel arm or cross-over design, were considered eligible for
      inclusion. There were no exclusions based on patient age or the type, dose or
      duration of budesonide therapy. The primary outcome was the induction of clinical
      remission in ulcerative colitis. Secondary outcomes included clinical, histologic
      and endoscopic improvement, endoscopic mucosal healing, change in disease
      activity index scores, adverse events and study withdrawals. DATA COLLECTION AND 
      ANALYSIS: Studies were reviewed for eligibility, data were extracted and quality 
      assessed by 2 independent investigators. It was not possible to perform a
      meta-analysis of the included studies due to significant heterogeneity, with each
      study comparing budesonide to a different control medication. MAIN RESULTS: Three
      studies met the inclusion criteria. Oral budesonide was significantly less likely
      to induce clinical remission than oral mesalamine after 8 weeks of therapy (RR
      0.72, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.91). There was no significant benefit of oral budesonide
      in comparison to placebo for inducing clinical remission after 4 weeks of
      treatment (RR 1.41, 95% CI 0.59 to 3.39). A small pilot study reported no
      statistically significant difference in endoscopic remission between budesonide
      and prednisolone (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.42). The study was small and not
      powered to evaluate the impact of budesonide on clinical remission. Suppression
      of plasma cortisol was significantly more common in prednisolone treated patients
      (RR 0.02, 95% CI 0.0 to 0.33). Two multicenter studies are ongoing. AUTHORS'
      CONCLUSIONS: At present, there is no evidence to recommend the clinical use of
      oral budesonide for the induction of remission in active ulcerative colitis.
      Mesalamine is superior to budesonide for the treatment of active ulcerative
      colitis.

AB  - Since the introduction of anti-TNF agents for the treatment of Crohn's disease
      there has been interest in the potential for treating ulcerative colitis with
      biological therapies. Early observational series suggested a benefit in the
      setting of severe, hospitalized patients. However, the recent completion of two
      large multi-center, double-blind placebo-controlled trials confirmed a role for
      infliximab for outpatients with refractory, moderate-severe disease with evidence
      for clinical remissions, mucosal healing, and a reduction in colectomies. Despite
      this evidence, there are numerous questions remaining regarding the optimal
      positioning in the setting of moderate-severe disease, potential benefits of
      concomitant immune suppression and the need for maintenance treatment after
      induction therapy. Additional clinical trials have demonstrated a less profound
      benefit for adalimumab at similar doses that are used in Crohn's disease. Other
      biological agents that have targeted T cells such as visiluzimab and abatacept
      were not demonstrated to be effective in controlled trials.

PG  - 452-62
LID - 10.1159/000320402 [doi]
AB  - Despite advances in our understanding of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      pathogenesis and increased ability to treat patients with severe and refractory
      disease, patients continue to suffer from disease complications, and increasing
      numbers of both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) patients are
      admitted annually in the USA. The rapid evolution in IBD medications and
      treatment paradigms has contributed to a disparity in clinical care which may
      vary between expert centers routinely treating large numbers of IBD patients and 
      hospitals with low annual IBD admissions. High-volume centers handling in excess 
      of 150 IBD annual admissions have improved operative and inpatient outcomes
      compared with hospitals caring for IBD patients less frequently. Although the
      precise reason for this disparity in clinical outcomes is not known, we
      hypothesize that expert centers provide superior IBD supportive therapy. This
      supportive care includes additional diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to help
      patients achieve optimal outcomes. We review information regarding disparities in
      the quality of IBD clinical care then focus on supportive therapy for IBD
      patients, including diagnostic approaches to identify confounding factors
      contributing to poor IBD outcome, supportive therapeutic approaches to optimize
      the outcome in hospitalized IBD patients, and future directions exploring
      brain-body interaction in the treatment of pain, stress and sleep deprivation in 
      patients suffering from IBD.

AB  - Current smoking increases the risk of developing Crohn's disease and worsens its 
      course, increasing the need for steroids, immunosuppressants, and re-operations. 
      On the contrary, smoking protects against ulcerative colitis and after disease
      onset improves its course, decreasing the need for colectomy. Smoking cessation
      improves Crohn's disease and worsens ulcerative colitis. Achieving smoking
      cessation in Crohn's disease is thus an important goal of therapy, whereas
      patients with ulcerative colitis should not be discouraged to quit, because the
      beneficial effect of smoking for their disease is counterbalanced by the
      deleterious respiratory and cardiovascular effects of tobacco. Physical activity 
      improves quality of life without detrimental effect on disease activity, and may 
      contribute to increase muscle mass and to prevent osteoporosis. Regarding
      nutrition, a Western diet may be associated with an increased risk of IBD, and a 
      case-control study revealed an increased consumption of linoleic acid before
      diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. Liquid diets may improve Crohn's disease flares 
      and decrease the need for steroids; however, there are no defined diets able to
      improve the disease course, and in Crohn's disease, supplementation with omega-3 
      fatty acids did not show a significant benefit. Obesity is becoming more
      prevalent in IBD and may be associated with higher disease activity. In total,
      adhering to four simple lifestyle factors - never smoking, physical activity,
      prudent diet and body mass index <25 - may have a strong impact both on the
      prevention of major chronic diseases and on the course of IBD.

AB  - Gut microbiota contains about 10(14) bacterial cells classified within 4
      bacterial phyla, namely Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and
      Proteobacteria. Much of the information has been generated through the
      application of nucleic acid-based methodologies (16S rRNA) which provide a
      cornerstone of microbial taxonomy. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves a
      dysregulated immune response to the gut microbiota in genetically predisposed
      hosts. Experimental animal models of colitis provide the best evidence that
      bacteria present in the bowel of the animals have an essential role in the
      pathogenesis of colitis since in most models, germ-free animals do not develop
      disease. Moreover, in the immunodeficient mouse model of colitis called TRUC
      (T-bet-/- x RAG2-/-), a colitogenic gut microbiota is selected and can be
      transmitted to mice with intact immunity and induce colitis. Current interest
      therefore focuses on the bacterial community as the source of antigens that fuel 
      the chronic inflammation seen in IBD. Dysbiosis, an imbalance between harmful and
      protective bacteria, has been evoked and investigated in IBD. Thus, besides the
      classical pathogens, gut microbiota can drive pathogenicity via two mechanisms:
      an expansion of 'pro-inflammatory' species or a restriction in the protective
      compounds of the microbiota. Complexity of the microbiota suggests that both
      mechanisms may contribute to chronic gut inflammation in IBD.

PG  - 1149-62
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21463 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gene-environment interplay modulates inflammatory bowel diseases
      (IBD). Dioxin-like compounds can activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and
      alter macrophage function as well as T-cell polarization. We hypothesized that
      attenuation of the AhR signaling pathway will ameliorate colitis in a murine
      model of IBD. METHODS: Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis was induced in
      C57BL/6 AhR null mice (AhR(-/-) ), heterozygous mice (AhR(-/+) ), and their
      wildtype (WT) littermates. Clinical and morphopathological parameters were used
      to compare the groups. PATIENTS: AhR pathway activation was analyzed in biopsy
      specimens from 25 IBD patients and 15 healthy controls. RESULTS: AhR(-/-) mice
      died before the end of the treatment. However, AhR(-/+) mice exhibited decreased 
      disease activity compared to WT mice. The AhR(-/+) mice expressed less
      proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) (6.1-
      versus 15.7-fold increase) and IL17 (23.7- versus 67.9-fold increase) and
      increased antiinflammatory IL-10 (2.3-fold increase) compared with the AhR(+/+)
      mice in the colon. Colonic macrophage infiltration was attenuated in the AhR(-/+)
      group. AhR and its downstream targets were significantly upregulated in IBD
      patients versus control (CYP1A1 -19.9, and IL8- 10-fold increase). CONCLUSIONS:
      Attenuation of the AhR receptor expression resulted in a protective effect during
      DSS-induced colitis, while the absence of AhR exacerbated the disease. Abnormal
      AhR pathway activation in the intestinal mucosa of IBD patients may promote
      chronic inflammation. Modulation of AhR signaling pathway via the diet, cessation
      of smoking, or administration of AhR antagonists could be viable strategies for
      the treatment of IBD.

TI  - Proinflammatory role of vasopressin through V1b receptors in hapten-induced
      experimental colitis in rodents: implication in IBD.
PG  - G1298-307
LID - 10.1152/ajpgi.00022.2010 [doi]
AB  - Vasopressin and its receptors modulate several gut functions, but their role in
      intestinal inflammation is unknown. Our aims were to determine 1) the
      localization of V1b receptors in human and rodent colon, 2) the role of
      vasopressin and V1b receptors in experimental colitis using two approaches:
      V1b(-)(/)(-) mice and a selective V1b receptor antagonist, SSR149415, and 3) the 
      mechanisms involved. V1b receptors were localized in normal and inflamed colon
      from humans and rats. Experimental colitis was induced in rats and mice and some 
      groups were treated before or after colitis induction with oral SSR149415 (3-30
      mg/kg). Other groups of mice were submitted to dehydration to increase
      vasopressin plasma levels, prior to colitis induction. Body weight, damage
      scores, MPO, and TNF-alpha tissue levels were determined. Finally, colonic
      segments of wild-type (WT) and V1b(-)(/)(-) mice were mounted in Ussing chambers 
      and paracellular permeability in response to vasopressin was studied. V1b
      receptors were expressed in enterocytes and ganglia cells of the enteric nervous 
      system of human and rat intestine. Expression levels were independent from
      inflammatory status. Colitis was less severe in rodents treated by either
      preventive or curative SSR149415 and in V1b(-)(/)(-) mice. 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzene 
      sulfonic acid induced a strong mortality in dehydrated animals that was reversed 
      by preventive SSR149415 or mast cell stabilizer. Vasopressin significantly
      increased paracellular permeability in WT, but not in V1b(-)(/)(-) mice.
      Preincubation of colon tissues with SSR149415 abolished the vasopressin effect.
      Similarly, vasopressin had no effect in colonic preparations from WT mice
      pretreated with mast cell stabilizers. Vasopressin, through V1b receptor
      interaction, has proinflammatory properties linked to mast cell activation and
      downstream alterations of the colonic epithelial barrier. These findings
      underline the potential interest of V1b receptor blockers in gut inflammatory
      diseases.

      case-control study.
PG  - 2099-108
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21286 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of complementary and alternative medicine in inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) has been extensively studied. However, the use of probiotics 
      and prebiotics is poorly documented, despite evidence of efficacy of particular
      probiotic strains in specific forms of IBD. METHODS: A case-control study
      comprising interviewer-administered questionnaires was conducted in IBD patients 
      and healthy controls. Data regarding use and knowledge of probiotics and
      prebiotics, demographic, and clinical information were collected. RESULTS: In
      total, 334 participants (234 IBD, 100 controls) were interviewed. Significantly
      more IBD patients than controls had ever used probiotics to manage their health
      (Crohn's disease [CD] 43%, ulcerative colitis [UC] 51%, controls 21%, P < 0.001).
      Prebiotic use was negligible. On logistic regression analysis, having UC (odds
      ratio [OR] 4.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.27-8.12) or CD (OR 3.05, 95% CI
      1.66-5.60) were the strongest predictors of probiotic use. Within IBD patients
      the strongest predictor of probiotic use was current steroid use (OR 2.4, 95% CI 
      1.11-5.18). IBD patients had greater probiotic knowledge scores than controls (P 
      = 0.003), although 20% of IBD probiotic users could not provide a definition of a
      probiotic. Less than half of IBD probiotic users discussed probiotic use with
      healthcare professionals, with commercial advertising being the primary source of
      information. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD use probiotics to manage their health
      but frequently choose strains without evidence of efficacy in IBD. Patients rely 
      on nonclinical sources of information and often do not disclose probiotic use to 
      healthcare professionals. Conventional healthcare providers should inquire about 
      probiotic use among their patients and offer evidence-based advice.

AB  - Biological therapies are an important step in the management of Inflammatory
      Bowel Diseases. In consideration of high cost and safety issues there is the need
      to have clear recommendations for their use. Despite the American
      Gastroenterological Association and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation
      have published exhaustive Inflammatory Bowel Disease guidelines, national
      guidelines may be necessary as cultural values, economical and legal issues may
      differ between countries. For these reasons the Italian Society of
      Gastroenterology and the Italian Group for the study of Inflammatory Bowel
      Disease have decided to elaborate the Italian guidelines on the use of biologics 
      in Inflammatory Bowel Disease. The following items have been chosen: definitions 
      of active, inactive, steroid dependent and resistant disease; measures of
      activity; anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha therapy use in active steroid
      dependent and refractory luminal Crohn's Disease, in fistulising Crohn's Disease,
      in steroid dependent and resistant active Ulcerative Colitis; risk of cancer;
      risk of infections during anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha therapy; special
      situations. These guidelines are based on evidence from relevant medical
      literature and clinical experience of a national working group.

      intravenous corticosteroids, a fulminant colitis index (FCI) greater or equal to 
      8 has been associated with a greater likelihood of colectomy (72 vs 16% with an
      FCI<8). This retrospective study aimed to assess the accuracy of such an
      association in infliximab-treated patients with moderate-to-severe bouts of UC.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was based on the medical files of 43 patients who
      had received at least one infusion of infliximab to treat moderate-to-severe UC
      (partial Mayo Clinic score). Remission and clinical response were also assessed
      using the partial Mayo score. The accuracy of an FCI greater or equal to 8 to
      predict the likelihood of colectomy was assessed by calculating the sensitivity, 
      specificity, positive and negative predictive values, Yule's Q coefficient,
      Youden's index and statistical significance (Chi(2) test). RESULTS: After
      treatment with infliximab, 10 patients were in remission (23.3%), 21 (48.8%) had 
      a clinical response, four (9.3%) had treatment failure (without, however,
      requiring colectomy) and eight (18.6%) had a colectomy. Calculation of the
      above-mentioned indicators revealed that an FCI greater or equal to 8 was not an 
      indicator of the risk of colectomy in this patient population, and found that
      only an FCI greater or equal to 16 was statistically significant. However, low
      values for sensitivity, positive predictive value and Youden's index preclude the
      clinical application of this latter result. CONCLUSION: In patients treated with 
      infliximab for moderate-to-severe UC attacks, the FCI is not a predictor of
      colectomy. In such patients, the factors predictive of a response to treatment or
      likelihood of colectomy, currently acknowledged with corticosteroid treatment,
      need to be further assessed for infliximab treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Subjective physician assessment is the cornerstone of routine
      ulcerative colitis (UC) management. Endoscopic and histologic assessment of UC
      provides objective measures of inflammatory disease activity. The level of
      agreement between physician impression of UC activity and endoscopic disease
      activity has not been evaluated. The aim was to assess the level of agreement
      between physician's clinical impression of UC disease activity and endoscopic and
      histologic findings of inflammation. METHODS: Using the Medical Archival
      Retrieval System at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, we reviewed
      clinical information on all UC patients between 1995 and 2008 who had clinic
      visits recorded prior to colonoscopy. Clinical UC disease activity was defined by
      the physician's clinical impression and the endoscopic and histologic activity by
      colonoscopy with biopsy. The level of agreement between colonoscopy assessment of
      UC with histologic and clinical assessment was determined by sensitivity,
      specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and the kappa coefficient. 
      RESULTS: There were 369 UC patients who had a clinic visit proximate to a
      colonoscopy. The mean age of patients was 46 +/- 16 years (50% female). The
      performance of clinical impression in recognizing disease activity, as determined
      by endoscopy, was relatively poor: sensitivity = 56.0%, predictive value negative
      = 56.8%, kappa coefficient = 0.35. In contrast, the performance of histological
      evaluation in recognizing disease activity was markedly better: sensitivity =
      93.5%, predictive value negative = 89.1%, kappa coefficient = 0.70. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The physician's clinical impression of UC activity shows poor agreement with
      endoscopy and histology, with over one-third of patients with chronic
      inflammation underrecognized by clinical impression. The consequences of
      underestimated UC activity by clinical assessment may include undertreatment of
      active disease and uncontrolled chronic inflammation.

TI  - Adverse effects of proton pump inhibitor drugs: clues and conclusions.
PG  - 624-31
LID - 10.1097/MOG.0b013e32833ea9d9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review evidence relating to the strength of associations
      that have appeared in largely observational studies, between high-dose or
      long-term use of proton pump inhibitor drugs and certain possibly attributable
      side-effects, which emerge from studies confounded by other variables. In
      retrospective studies not designed to assess safety, evidence of causality is
      generally lacking. RECENT FINDINGS: The associations of fractures of hip, wrist, 
      forearm and other sites appear weak and only slightly higher than the risks in
      control populations matched for age. They may increase with drug exposure, but
      probably do so only in individuals in whom other risk factors are also
      operational (smoking, alcohol, poor nutrition, steroids, etc.). The risks of
      Clostridium difficile colitis, other enteric infections, small bowel bacterial
      overgrowth and possibly spontaneous bacterial peritonitis also appear increased. 
      Impaired gastric secretion may adversely affect the absorption of various
      nutrients, but their clinical impact is ill defined. Potentially more important
      are the consequences of hypergastrinemia, including rebound hypersecretion of
      acid, and possible development of various cancers, including carcinoid tumors.
      Effects of other drugs, including clopidogrel, on metabolism are reviewed, but
      clouded by uncertainties. SUMMARY: The safety of long-term PPI administration
      needs serious prospective study.

TI  - Faecal calprotectin, lactoferrin, M2-pyruvate kinase and S100A12 in severe
      ulcerative colitis: a prospective multicentre comparison of predicting outcomes
      and monitoring response.
PG  - 1207-12
LID - 10.1136/gut.2010.211755 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare four faecal markers for their ability to predict steroid
      refractoriness in severe paediatric ulcerative colitis (UC). Construct validity
      and responsiveness to change were also assessed. METHODS: This was a prospective 
      multicentre cohort study. Stool samples from 101 children (13.3 + or - 3.6 years;
      Pediatric UC Activity Index (PUCAI) at admission 72 + or - 12 points) were
      obtained at the third day of intravenous steroid therapy. Repeated samples at
      discharge were obtained from 24 children. Predictive validity was assessed using 
      diagnostic utility statistics to predict steroid failure (ie, the need for
      salvage treatment). Concurrent validity was assessed using correlational analysis
      with the following constructs: PUCAI, Lindgren and Seo scores, physician's global
      assessment, albumin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein (CRP).
      Responsiveness was assessed using test utility and correlational strategies.
      RESULTS: Median values (IQR) were very high at baseline for all four markers
      (calprotectin 4215 microg/g (2297-8808); lactoferrin 212 microg/g (114-328);
      M2-pyruvate kinase (M2-PK) 363 U/g (119-3104); and S100A12 469 microg/g
      (193-1112)). M2-PK was numerically superior to the other three markers and CRP in
      predicting response to corticosteroid treatment (area under the receiver
      operating characteristic (ROC) curve 0.75 (95% CI 0.64 to 0.85; p<0.001) vs <0.65
      for the others). However, it did not add to the predictive ability of the PUCAI
      (area under the ROC 0.81 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.89)). M2-PK also had the highest
      construct validity but with a modest mean correlation with all constructs (r=0.3;
      p<0.05). None of the markers was responsive to change (Spearman's rho correlation
      with change in the PUCAI <0.1; p>0.05, area under the ROC curve <0.65; p>0.05).
      CONCLUSIONS: The four markers were greatly elevated in severe paediatric UC. Only
      M2-PK had good construct and predictive validity, and none was responsive to
      change. The PUCAI, a simple clinical index, performed better than the faecal
      markers in predicting outcome following a course of intravenous corticosteroids
      in severe UC.

PG  - 112-5

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is known about the impact of disease and treatment on
      the pattern of growth in children with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).
      Significant deficits in height and weight in children with Crohn's disease have
      been reported but changes in fat and fat free mass are less well defined. This
      study aims to describe the height, weight and body composition of a cohort of
      children with IBD. METHODS: Height, weight, skinfold thicknesses and
      bioelectrical impedance analysis was performed. Disease activity was assessed
      with clinical scoring systems. RESULTS: 55 children, median age 13.7 years (range
      6.5-17.7) were studied. Median (25th, 75th percentile) Standard Deviation Score
      for BMI, Height and Weight were - 0.3 (- 0.97, 0.65), - 0.56 (- 1.42, 0.06), -
      0.62 (- 1.43, 0.19). In Crohn's disease, using multiple regression analysis
      disease activity measured by PCDAI was significantly inversely related to fat
      free mass (beta - 0.2, 95% CI -0.17, -0.03, p 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Children with 
      IBD were both under and overweight. Nutritional deficits were more common in
      Crohn's disease. Fat free mass was related to disease activity in children with
      Crohn's disease regardless of changes in weight. Weight or BMI may mask deficits 
      in lean tissue in the presence of normal or increased proportions of body fat.

AB  - Nutrition interventions play a central role in the treatment and management of
      inflammatory bowel disease in children. Malnutrition is a common presenting
      symptom in both pediatric ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and is
      associated with increased morbidity. Providing macronutrients can improve growth;
      likewise, identifying and correcting micronutrient deficiencies can improve
      comorbid conditions like osteopenia and anemia. Although many patients manipulate
      their diets to help treat their inflammatory bowel disease, only parenteral
      nutrition with bowel rest and exclusive enteral nutrition therapy have been shown
      effective for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Nutritional status in patients with active inflammatory bowel disease: prevalence
      of malnutrition and methods for routine nutritional assessment.
PG  - 315-9
LID - 10.1016/j.ejim.2010.04.012 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Malnutrition is a common feature of inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). There are numerous methods for the assessment of nutritional
      status, but the gold standard has not yet been established. The aims of the study
      were to estimate the prevalence of undernutrition and to evaluate methods for
      routine nutritional assessment of active IBD patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS:
      Twenty-three patients with active Crohn disease, 53 patients with active
      ulcerative colitis and 30 controls were included in the study. The nutritional
      status was assessed by extensive anthropometric measurements, percentage of
      weight loss in the past 1-6 months and biochemical markers of nutrition. RESULTS:
      All investigated nutritional parameters were significantly different in IBD
      patients compared to control subjects, except MCV, tryglicerides and serum total 
      protein level. Serum albumin level and body mass index (BMI) were the most
      predictive parameters of malnutrition. According to different assessment methods 
      the prevalence of undernutrition and severe undernutrition in patients with
      active IBD were 25.0%-69.7% and 1.3%-31.6%, respectively, while in the control
      subjects no abnormalities have been detected. There was no statistically
      significant difference of nutritional parameters between UC and CD patients
      except lower mid-arm muscle circumference in UC group. CONCLUSIONS: Malnutrition 
      is common in IBD patients. BMI and serum albumin are simple and convenient
      methods for the assessment of the nutritional status in IBD patients. Further
      studies with larger group of patients are necessary to elucidate the prevalence
      of malnutrition and the most accurate assessment methods in IBD patients.

AB  - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are lifelong conditions with particular
      effects upon nutrition, especially in children and adolescents. Various therapies
      are available for these conditions but there remains no cure. Over the last
      decades, exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) has been demonstrated to have efficacy
      in the induction of remission, along with numerous other nutritional and
      inflammatory benefits. This article reviews the benefits and outcomes associated 
      with EEN in Crohn's disease. The potential mechanisms of this therapy are
      highlighted, along with factors that are barriers to the wider use of EEN.

AB  - The field of nutrigenomics recognizes gene-diet interactions, with regard to both
      the impact of genetic variation on nutrient requirements, and conversely nutrient
      regulation of the expression of genes. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are
      inflammatory bowel diseases for which twin studies reveal genetic susceptibility 
      that is impacted by diet and environment. Apparently contradictory data on the
      role of diet in inflammatory bowel disease would be entirely explainable if
      genetic variability determined dietary requirements and intolerances. Considering
      Crohn's disease, we recognize three major classes of genes. The first of these
      involves bacterial recognition through pattern recognition receptors and
      autophagy genes, while the second act through secondary immune response, and the 
      third concern epithelial barrier integrity. Despite genetic overlap with CD, the 
      first two groups of genes appear to be less important in ulcerative colitis,
      while other genes, particularly those involved in barrier function, gain
      prominence. Case-control studies suggest that these different genetic groups
      reflect distinct dietary requirements. Such studies suggest nutrigenomic
      approaches to maintaining disease remission at present, and preventing disease
      development in the future.

TI  - Usefulness of co-treatment with immunomodulators in patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease treated with scheduled infliximab maintenance therapy.
PG  - 1363-8
LID - 10.1136/gut.2010.212712 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Concomitant use of immunosuppressants (IS) with scheduled
      infliximab (IFX) maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative
      colitis (UC) is debated. The aim of this study was to assess whether IS
      co-treatment is useful in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on
      scheduled IFX infusions. METHODS: 121 consecutive patients with IBD (23 UC, 98
      CD) treated by IFX and who received at least 6 months of IS co-treatment
      (azathioprine (AZA) or methotrexate (MTX)) were studied. In each patient, the IFX
      treatment duration was divided into semesters which were independently analysed
      regarding IBD activity. RESULTS: Semesters with IS (n=265) and without IS (n=319)
      were analysed. IBD flares, perianal complications and switch to adalimumab were
      less frequently observed in semesters with IS than in those without IS
      (respectively: 19.3% vs 32.0%, p=0.003; 4.1% vs 11.8%, p=0.03; 1.1% vs 5.3%,
      p=0.006). Maximal C-reactive protein (CRP) level and IFX dose/kg observed during 
      the semesters were lower in semesters with IS. Within semesters with IS, IBD
      flares and perianal complications were less frequently observed in semesters with
      AZA than in those with MTX. In multivariate analysis, IS co-treatment was
      associated with a decreased risk of IBD flare (OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.79)
      CONCLUSION: In patients with IBD receiving IFX maintenance therapy, IS
      co-treatment is associated with reduced IBD activity, IFX dose and switch to
      adalimumab. In this setting, co-treatment with AZA seems to be more effective
      than co-treatment with MTX. Benefit of such a combination treatment has to be
      balanced with potential risks, notably infections and cancers.

PG  - 1415-24
LID - 10.1038/labinvest.2010.117 [doi]
AB  - The ErbB4 receptor tyrosine kinase is expressed at high levels in human and mouse
      colitis, and inhibits colon epithelial cell apoptosis in the presence of
      proinflammatory cytokines. In this study, we investigated the molecular
      mechanisms responsible for ErbB4-induced cell survival. In cultured mouse colon
      epithelial cells, ErbB4 overexpression resulted in increased levels of
      cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mRNA and protein; in contrast, ErbB4 knockdown with
      siRNA blocked COX-2 accumulation in response to tumor necrosis factor. Although
      ErbB4 is expressed as up to four isoforms in epithelial tissues, its ability to
      promote COX-2 expression was isoform independent. ErbB4-stimulated COX-2
      induction was associated with an increase in mRNA half-life and was blocked by
      inhibition of Src, phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, or epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR). Furthermore, ErbB4 expression promoted EGFR phosphorylation in
      the presence of heregulin, implicating ErbB4-EGFR heterodimerization in these
      responses. As to the cellular responses to ErbB4 activation, increased survival
      of ErbB4-expressing cells in the presence of proinflammatory cytokines was
      sensitive to the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib. Furthermore, ErbB4-overexpressing
      cells acquired the ability to form colonies in soft agar, indicative of cellular 
      transformation, also in a celecoxib-sensitive manner. Together our data indicate 
      that ErbB4 is a key regulator of COX-2 expression and cellular survival in colon 
      epithelial cells, acting in concert with EGFR through a Src- and PI
      3-kinase-dependent mechanism. These results suggest that chronic overexpression
      of ErbB4 in the context of inflammation could contribute to colitis-associated
      tumorigenesis by inhibiting colonocyte apoptosis.

TI  - Colonic ischemia and perforation associated with enteral feeding through an ileal
      tube.
PG  - 301-3
LID - 10.1177/0884533610368705 [doi]
AB  - Reported complications of enteral feeding through a jejunostomy include diarrhea,
      intraperitoneal leaks, bowel obstruction, fistula formation, wound infection,
      tube occlusion, and other mechanical malfunctions. However, the incidence of
      these complications is very low, and many physicians prefer to feed their
      patients by means of a jejunal tube instead of parenteral nutrition. A
      potentially lethal complication is ischemia of the bowel distal to the site of
      insertion of the feeding catheter. The described cases of bowel ischemia
      secondary to enteral nutrition invariably occurred at the level of the jejunum.
      This report describes an unusual case of perforation of the colon in a patient
      fed through an erroneously placed feeding catheter in the distal ileum, just
      proximal to the ileocecal valve. After weeks of continuous and intractable
      diarrhea and progressive weight loss, the patient developed diffuse colonic
      ischemia with subsequent free perforation of the left colon and peritonitis.
      Surgical treatment consisted of placement of a new feeding tube in the proximal
      jejunum and removal of the old one together with a short segment of small bowel, 
      left hemicolectomy, and end colostomy. The patient tolerated the procedure well, 
      the tube feedings were gradually restarted, and at the 6-month postoperative
      visit gastrointestinal function was normal. This case illustrates possible
      complications of an inadvertently placed feeding tube. Not only may it cause
      unexplained diarrhea and undernutrition, but it may lead to more serious events
      like colonic ischemia and perforation.

AB  - Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis has become the
      surgical treatment of choice for patients with ulcerative colitis and familial
      polyposis coli syndromes. Pouch construction uses the distal 30-40 cm of ileum,
      and there exists a potential for postoperative nutrition consequences. These
      include vitamin B(12) deficiency, iron deficiency, bile acid malabsorption, and
      abnormalities of trace elements, fluids, and electrolytes. Patients who have
      undergone an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis procedure often describe specific food 
      sensitivities that may require diet alteration, even more so than do patients
      with permanent ileostomy. There may be roles for postoperative probiotic
      supplementation in an attempt to decrease the rate of "pouchitis" and appropriate
      preoperative nutrition support to minimize the risk of perioperative
      complications.

TI  - Risk factors for neoplasia in inflammatory bowel disease patients with
      pancolitis.
PG  - 2405-11
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2010.248 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Colorectal cancer (CRC), developing from dysplastic lesions, is the
      main long-term complication of pancolitis. The aims of the present study were to 
      assess the risks for neoplasia and advanced neoplasia (AN), respectively, in
      ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) patients with pancolitis, and to
      search for protective and risk factors for colorectal neoplasia. METHODS: A total
      of 855 inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with longstanding pancolitis
      (276 UC, 56 IBD unclassified (IBDu), and 523 CD) had pathological examination of 
      a proctocolectomy specimen (n=255) or multiple biopsy samples from a surveillance
      colonoscopy (n=600) after median disease duration of 115 months. Risk factors for
      low-grade dysplasia (LGD) and AN, respectively, were searched for in the whole
      group of patients and in a case-control comparison after matching for IBD
      phenotype. RESULTS: A total of 75 patients eventually developed colorectal
      neoplasia: 14 adenomas, 28 nonadenomatous LGD, and 33 ANs. The 25-year cumulative
      risks for neoplasia and AN, respectively, were 32.8+/-5.7% and 25.9+/-5.7% in UC 
      and IBDu vs. 12.1+/-2.7% and 3.9+/-2.0% in CD (P<0.0001). In CD, patients with
      UC-like endoscopic appearance (n=126) had an increased risk for AN compared with 
      those with discrete lesions (at 25 years, 10.6+/-7.2 vs. 1.5+/-0.9%). In the
      case-control comparison, factors associated with an increased risk of AN were
      primary sclerosing cholangitis (hazard ratio (HR) 4.72 (1.54-14.52)) and family
      history of CRC (HR 3.37 (1.02-11.14)), whereas previous segmental colectomy was
      protective (HR 0.25 (0.07-0.88)). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of AN in longstanding
      pancolitis is higher in UC or IBDu than in CD. In CD, this risk is significantly 
      increased in patients with UC-like endoscopic lesions. The surveillance program
      should focus on these latter patients.

AB  - Nutrition-related factors together with components of the gut-associated
      microbial ecosystem (gut microbiota) emerge as prime environmental triggers for
      the development and modification of lifestyle-related chronic diseases including 
      chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastro-intestinal tract such as Crohn's
      disease and ulcerative colitis. Although a variety of susceptibility genes were
      identified in genome-wide association studies, the impact of environmental
      factors in initiating or promoting the development of these complex diseases are 
      unknown. Nutrigenomics is a transdisciplinary approach to understand the subtle
      but contentious impact of nutrition and/or microbes as prime environmental
      triggers in shaping the dynamic range between health and diseases. Profiling
      technologies such as transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabonomics at the
      interface of the host's genetic make-up and its metabolic phenotype are
      implemented to identify cellular and molecular targets to develop novel
      hypothesise with respect to the functional role of diet and gut bacteria in
      modulating chronic degenerative diseases including inflammatory bowel disease.

AB  - CONTEXT: Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory bowel disease involving
      superficial inflammation of the mucosa of the colon, rectum, and anus, sometimes 
      including the terminal ileum. When in clinical activity, the disease is
      characterized by various daily evacuations containing blood, mucus and/or pus
      alternating periods of remission. OBJECTIVE: To compare nutritional parameters
      (dietary, biochemical and anthropometric) among patients with ulcerative colitis 
      followed up on an outpatient basis over a period of 1 year and during periods of 
      intestinal inflammatory activity and remission. METHODS: Sixty-five patients were
      studied over a period of 1 year and divided into two groups: group 1 with
      inflammatory disease activity (n = 24), and group 2 without disease activity (n =
      41). Anthropometric measures, biochemical parameters, quantitative food intake,
      and qualitative food frequency were analyzed. RESULTS: A significant reduction in
      body mass index and weight and in the intake of energy, proteins, lipids,
      calcium, iron and phosphorus was observed in the group with inflammatory activity
      (group 1) when compared to the period of clinical remission. The most affected
      food groups were cereals, legumes, oils, and fats. In contrast, in group 2
      significant differences in triceps and sub scapular skin fold thickness, total
      protein, hemoglobin and hematocrit were observed between the first and final
      visit. Calcium and vitamin B6 intake, as well as the consumption of legumes, meat
      and eggs, and sugar and sweets, was significantly higher than on the first visit.
      CONCLUSION: Patients with ulcerative colitis followed up on an outpatient basis
      tend to be well nourished. However, the nutritional aspects studied tend to
      worsen during the period of inflammatory disease activity.

TI  - [Influence of enteral nutrition therapy on serum angiogenic growth factors
      concentrations in children].
PG  - 31-5
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Effectiveness of enteral nutrition therapy is not only connected
      with improvement of the nutritional status of the patient, but also with its
      strong anti-inflammatory activity. Angiogenic growth factors play an important
      role in the early stage of inflammation. Vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) stimulate the
      angiogenesis and healing processes. The objective of our study was to assess the 
      influence of the enteral nutrition therapy on the vascular endothelial growth
      factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) concentrations
      in serum in children with different diseases of gastro-intestinal tract, in which
      enteral nutrition therapy is effective method of treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS:
      Sixty two children (29 boys, 33 girls, mean age: 12.5 yrs, range: 6-18 yrs) and
      25 healthy controls were included into the study. The Crohn's disease group (CD) 
      consisted of 25 patients, ulcerative colitis group (UC)-18 patients, acute
      pancreatitis (AP) group-12 patients and severe malnutrition (N) group-7 patients.
      Serum VEGF and TGF-beta 1 concentrations were assessed at baseline, before
      starting and after 2 and 4 weeks of enteral nutrition therapy using ELISA
      immunoassays (R and D Systems, USA). RESULTS: Before starting enteral nutrition, 
      we found increased VEGF concentration in CD group (Me = 600 pg/ml) compared to UC
      group (266.9 pg/ml), AP group (552.6 pg/ml), N group (238.5 pg/ml) and controls
      (172 pg/ml) (p < 0.05). We found decrease of VEGF concentrations during enteral
      nutrition in CD, UC and N group and increase in AP at the beginning, followed by 
      decrease to the initial values. Assessing TGF-beta 1, we found its concentration 
      increased before starting enteral nutrition in UC group (37.5 ng/ml) compared to 
      CD group (29.7 ng/ ml) and controls (24.8 ng/ml) (p < 0.05). During enteral
      nutrition we observed decrease of TGF-beta 1 concentration in UC group and
      increase in CD group (32,7 ng/ml) and AP group (26,6 ng/ml) (p < 0.05) The best
      improvement of nutritional status was observed in CD patients compared to N and
      AP patients. CONCLUSIONS: Differentiation of serum VEGF and TGF-beta 1
      concentrations, what was observed in various gastro-intestinal diseases, reflects
      different mechanisms of enteral nutrition therapy acting on the inflammatory
      process. The most efficient therapeutic effect was seen in CD, where stimulation 
      of TGF-beta 1 production was observed.

      ulcerative colitis (UC).
PG  - 422-6
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Epigenetic marking such as DNA methylation influence gene
      transcription and chromosomal stability and may also be affected by environmental
      exposures. Few studies exist on alteration in DNA methylation profiles (genomic
      and gene specific methylation) in patients with Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and no
      studies exist that assess its relationship with lifestyle exposures. RESULTS: The
      methylation level of both ESR-1 and N-33 genes were significantly higher in UC
      subjects compared with controls (7.9% vs. 5.9%; p = 0.015 and 66% vs. 9.3%; p <
      0.001 respectively). There was no detectable difference in global DNA methylation
      between patients with UC and age and sex matched controls. No associations
      between indices of DNA methylation and anthropometric measures or smoking
      patterns were detected. AIMS & METHODS: To assess genomic methylation and
      promoter methylation of the ESR-1 (oestrogen receptor-1) and N-33 (tumor
      suppressor candidate-3) genes in the macroscopically normal mucosa of UC patients
      as well as to investigate effects of anthropometric and lifestyle exposures on
      DNA methylation. Sixty eight subjects were recruited (24 UC and 44 age and sex
      matched controls). Colorectal mucosal biopsies were obtained and DNA was
      extracted. Genomic DNA methylation was quantified using the tritium-labelled
      cytosine extension assay (3[H] dCTP) while gene specific methylation was
      quantified using the COBRA method. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, we have shown
      increased methylation in the promoter regions of the putative tumor suppressor
      gene N-33 in macroscopically normal mucosa of patients with UC. In addition, we
      have confirmed that methylation of ESR-1 promoter is higher in UC patients
      compared with age and sex matched controls. These findings suggest that
      inactivation through methylation of the putative tumor suppressor genes N-33 and 
      ESR-1 may not be associated with colorectal carcinogenesis in UC.

TI  - Effect of butyrate enemas on inflammation and antioxidant status in the colonic
      mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis in remission.
PG  - 738-44
LID - 10.1016/j.clnu.2010.04.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Butyrate, produced by colonic fermentation of dietary fibers
      is often hypothesized to beneficially affect colonic health. This study aims to
      assess the effects of butyrate on inflammation and oxidative stress in subjects
      with chronically mildly elevated parameters of inflammation and oxidative stress.
      METHODS: Thirty-five patients with ulcerative colitis in clinical remission daily
      administered 60 ml rectal enemas containing 100mM sodium butyrate (n=17) or
      saline (n=18) during 20 days (NCT00696098). Before and after the intervention
      feces, blood and colonic mucosal biopsies were obtained. Parameters of
      antioxidant defense and oxidative damage, myeloperoxidase, several cytokines,
      fecal calprotectin and CRP were determined. RESULTS: Butyrate enemas induced
      minor effects on colonic inflammation and oxidative stress. Only a significant
      increase of the colonic IL-10/IL-12 ratio was found within butyrate-treated
      patients (p=0.02), and colonic concentrations of CCL5 were increased after
      butyrate compared to placebo treatment (p=0.03). Although in general butyrate did
      not affect colonic glutathione levels, the effects of butyrate enemas on total
      colonic glutathione appeared to be dependent on the level of inflammation.
      CONCLUSION: Although UC patients in remission were characterized by low-grade
      oxidative stress and inflammation, rectal butyrate enemas showed only minor
      effects on inflammatory and oxidative stress parameters.

TI  - Butyrate enemas do not affect human colonic MUC2 and TFF3 expression.
PG  - 1134-40
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0b013e32833a6ca0 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The colonic mucus layer plays an important role in the protection
      of the intestinal epithelium and mainly consists of mucin glycoproteins
      (primarily MUC2 in the colon) trefoil factor 3 (TFF3) and secretory IgA. Butyrate
      is a major end product of fermentation of dietary fibres and is associated with
      beneficial effects on colonic health. Earlier in-vitro and animal studies showed 
      that butyrate modulates MUC2 and TFF3 expression and mucin secretion, although
      data from human studies are not yet available. METHODS: Sixteen healthy
      volunteers and 35 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients in clinical remission
      self-administered a 60 ml rectal enema containing 100 mmol/l butyrate or placebo 
      once daily for 2 and 3 weeks, respectively. After each treatment, biopsies were
      taken from the distal sigmoid for quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemical
      analysis of MUC2 and TFF3. In addition, mucosal sections were stained with high
      iron diamine-alcian blue to distinguish between sialomucins and sulphomucins. To 
      analyse total mucin secretion and secretory IgA concentrations, 24 h faeces were 
      collected during the day before the endoscopic examination. RESULTS: The butyrate
      intervention did not significantly modulate the expression of MUC2 (fold change: 
      1.04 and 1.05 in healthy volunteers and ulcerative colitis patients,
      respectively) or TFF3 (fold change: 0.91 and 0.94 in healthy volunteers and UC
      patients, respectively). Furthermore, the percentage of sialomucins, mucus
      secretion and secretory IgA concentrations were not affected by the butyrate
      intervention in both the groups. CONCLUSION: Butyrate exposure in healthy
      volunteers and UC patients in remission did not affect the measured parameters of
      the colonic mucus layer.

PG  - 181-92
LID - S0212-16112010000200001 [pii]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease is an entity with not wellknown pathogenesis, and
      important nutritional and metabolic implications because of the high prevalence
      of malnutrition, the possible implication of dietary factors in its pathogenesis 
      and because of the hypothesis that nutritional intervention could be a primary
      treatment for the disease. Some nutrients could induce a low antigenic stimuli,
      regulate inflammatory and immunological responses and stimulate intestinal
      mucosal trophism. Present available evidence supports enteral nutrition in
      Crohn's disease as a primary treatment if treatment with steroids is not possible
      (failure or contraindication) (grade of recommendation A) or either combined
      treatment with drugs in malnourished patients or those with inflammatory bowel
      stenosis. In those patients with sustained clinical remission, no benefit of
      either enteral nutrition or supplements in the absence of nutritional deficits
      has been shown. Elemental or modified formula (glutamine, omega 3 fatty acids)
      could not be recommended. In ulcerative colitis, nutritional influence over the
      activity of the disease has not been shown, although there are some promising
      results regarding enteric coated W3 fatty acids and a possible role for
      probiotics. In the treatment and prevention of pouchitis, there could be a role
      for probiotics (VSL#3). Nutritional treatment should be considered an integral
      component in the Management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

PG  - 1230-6
LID - 10.1542/peds.2009-1936 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The goal was to compare the predictive values of the Prometheus
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Serology 7 (IBD7) panel (Prometheus
      Laboratories, San Diego, CA) with the predictive values of routine blood tests in
      a population of children referred for initial evaluation of suspected IBD.
      METHODS: Medical records of pediatric patients referred for evaluation of IBD for
      whom IBD7 testing was performed at Prometheus Laboratories between January 2006
      and November 2008 were reviewed. Patients underwent diagnosis by pediatric
      gastroenterologists on the basis of clinical, radiologic, endoscopic, and
      pathologic evaluations. RESULTS: A total of 394 records were identified. We
      excluded 90 records on the basis of age of >21 years, previous diagnosis of IBD, 
      or unclear diagnosis. The prevalence of IBD in this cohort was 38%. The
      sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value,
      and kappa value for the serological panel were 67%, 76%, 63%, 79%, and 42%,
      respectively, compared with values for a combination of 3 abnormal routine
      laboratory test results of 72%, 94%, 85%, 79%, and 47%. The antiflagellin
      antibody assay, the newest assay added to the panel, had sensitivity of 50% and
      specificity of 53%. Repeat serological testing failed to produce consistent
      results for 4 of 10 patients. CONCLUSION: Despite its recent inclusion of the
      antiflagellin assay, the IBD7 panel has lower predictive values than routine
      laboratory tests in pediatric screening for IBD.

TI  - Incidence and risk of intestinal and extra-intestinal complications in Medicaid
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a 5-year population-based study.
PG  - 1689-95
LID - 10.1007/s10620-010-1236-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Intestinal and extra-intestinal complications are associated 
      with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) but their exact incidence is not well
      known. In order to improve our understanding of their incidence and impact, we
      assessed the complications associated with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's
      disease (CD) in a population-based study in Medicaid patients. METHODS: We
      utilized a retrospective cohort design and identified cases of UC and CD using
      Medi-Cal, the Medicaid program for the State of California. The disease cohort
      was age- and gender-matched to four controls each and the intestinal and
      extra-intestinal complications of CD and UC (analyzed separately) were studied
      over a period of 5 years following the initial diagnosis. RESULTS: For UC, the
      total number of intestinal complications, per 100 cases, was 92 observed compared
      to 21 expected; the total number of extra-intestinal complications was 42
      observed compared to 30 expected. For CD, the number of intestinal complications 
      was 81 observed compared to 20 expected and for extra-intestinal complications,
      37 observed compared to 26 expected (all p < 0.001). For both UC and CD, bleeding
      was the most frequently seen intestinal complication, while the most common
      extra-intestinal complication was osteoporosis. CONCLUSIONS: IBD is associated
      with several intestinal and extra-intestinal complications of variable incidence 
      and risk. Success of therapeutic regimens should be measured by decreases in
      incidence, risks, and costs of these complications, in addition to the usual
      impact on disease activity.

TI  - Update on the role of probiotics in the therapy of pediatric inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 47-54
AB  - Probiotics have had many applications in the past few years, and inflammatory
      conditions of the GI tract--including chronic disorders such as inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD)--have received the most attention by investigators. In fact, 
      the experimental basis to expect clinical efficacy of probiotics in IBD is quite 
      robust. In spite of this however, only minimal evidence of benefit by any
      probiotic is currently available in Crohn's disease, either in adult or in
      pediatric populations. In ulcerative colitis, on the other hand, several
      probiotic formulations and especially the proprietary preparation VSL#3 (a
      high-concentration mixture) have been found effective as adjuvant therapy, both
      in inducing and maintaining remission.

TI  - The association of inflammatory bowel disease and Mediterranean fever gene (MEFV)
      mutations in Turkish children.
PG  - 3488-94
LID - 10.1007/s10620-010-1178-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) concordance has been investigated in a few studies. We investigated
      MEFV mutations and prevalence of FMF disease in Turkish children with IBD and
      their relationship with the disease severity. METHODS: Sixteen patients with
      ulcerative colitis (UC), 14 with Crohn's disease (CD) and three with
      indeterminate colitis (IC) were enrolled in the study (median age 13 years, range
      0.6-16 years, n = 19 boys). Demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics 
      of the patients were evaluated as well as the parameters of disease severity. All
      patients were screened for 12 common MEFV mutations. RESULTS: MEFV mutations were
      detected in 17 of 66 (25.7%) alleles. Seven patients (four patients with CD, two 
      with IC, and one with UC) were also diagnosed as FMF. FMF disease was found in
      seven of all IBD patients (21.2%) and four of them had CD. M694V was the leading 
      mutation, and as a disease-causing mutation, it was found to be significantly
      more frequent in CD patients than UC patients (Fisher's exact test P = 0.03).
      Demographics, laboratory evaluations, growth parameters, extraintestinal
      manifestations, and treatment with immunosuppressive agents other than steroids
      were comparable between the patients with and without FMF in most aspects.
      CONCLUSIONS: Although this is a small cohort, disease-causing MEFV mutations and 
      FMF disease rate were increased among our patients with IBD. The increase was
      prominent among CD patients, whereas in UC the rate was similar to the Turkish
      healthy control population.

TI  - Chronic inflammation and mutagenesis.
PG  - 3-11
LID - 10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2010.03.007 [doi]
AB  - Inflammation is a necessary part of the immune response. However, when
      inflammation persists, the resultant state of chronic inflammation may have a
      number of secondary consequences associated with increased risk of chronic
      disease. Among these is an increased rate of mutation. There is evidence to
      suggest that the accumulation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species may be a
      causal factor in chronic inflammation. These reactive species are also produced
      through the oxidative burst associated with the inflammatory process, and may
      interact with various cellular components including proteins, lipids and, most
      important for mutagenesis, nucleic acids. DNA strand breaks are commonly
      produced, leading to chromosomal mutation. Oxidized bases, abasic sites, DNA-DNA 
      intrastrand adducts, and DNA-protein cross-links also occur. Not only do the
      nucleic acid products act directly as pro-mutagenic lesions, lipid peroxidation
      products may also lead to secondary DNA damage, including pro-mutagenic exocyclic
      DNA adducts. While frameshift and chromosomal mutations have been associated with
      chronic inflammation, much of the evidence reveals base pair substitution
      mutations associated with polymerase stalling near the lesions, and base pair
      mis-incorporation. There are also indirect effects of ROS/RNS through inhibition 
      of DNA repair enzymes and/or effects on metabolic activation of known
      carcinogens. Certain disease states, including the Inflammatory bowel diseases,
      Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are associated with enhanced levels of
      chronic inflammation, and show evidence of enhanced levels of genetic damage in
      the colonic mucosa. Mutations may provide at least part of the cause of enhanced 
      susceptibility to chronic diseases associated with chronic inflammation.

TI  - Impaired erythrocyte antioxidant defense in active inflammatory bowel disease:
      impact of anemia and treatment.
PG  - 1467-75
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21234 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress contributes to the propagation and exacerbation of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) but the status of erythrocyte antioxidant
      defense remains unknown. METHODS: Erythrocyte activities of superoxide
      dismutase-1 (SOD1), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx1) were determined
      in 174 IBD patients and 105 controls and referred to IBD activity, inflammation
      severity, nutritional status, systemic oxidative stress, anemia, and treatment.
      RESULTS: Catalase and GPx1 activities were decreased in active IBD, whereas SOD1 
      became upregulated by IBD-related oxidative stress. In Crohn's disease (CD)
      corticosteroids decreased SOD1 activity. SOD1 correlated indirectly with CD
      activity and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and directly with transferrin. 
      In ulcerative colitis (UC) anemia downregulated SOD1. Decreases in GPx activity
      corresponded with IBD activity, anemia, inflammation, and malnutrition. Oxidative
      stress in UC and corticosteroids in CD also downregulated GPx. Catalase activity 
      was decreased by CD-related anemia, correlating directly with hemoglobin, and
      indirectly with CD activity, inflammatory and protein oxidative stress markers.
      When co-analyzed, anemia but not CD activity significantly contributed to
      catalase downregulation. In UC, catalase activity corresponded indirectly with UC
      endoscopic activity and inflammation and directly with hemoglobin. UC activity,
      anemia, and treatment with azathioprine negatively affected catalase. As
      indicators of active IBD, GPx1 showed a diagnostic accuracy of 73%, whereas
      catalase showed 63% as compared to 74% of C-reactive protein and ESR.
      CONCLUSIONS: Erythrocyte antioxidant defense is impaired in active IBD. SOD1,
      GPx1, and CAT activities are differently affected by the disease type, activity, 
      anemia, inflammation, oxidative stress, and treatment. As an active IBD
      indicator, GPx1 was comparable to C-reactive protein and ESR.

PG  - 583-7
AB  - AIM: To evaluate whether crypt abscesses from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      patients contain bacteria and to establish their nature. METHODS: We studied 17
      ulcerative colitis patients, 11 Crohn's disease patients, 7 patients with acute
      self-limited colitis (ASLC) and normal colonic biopsies from 5 subjects who
      underwent colonoscopy for colon cancer screening. A fluorescent in situ
      hybridization technique was applied to colonic biopsies to assess the microbiota 
      composition of the crypts and crypt abscesses. RESULTS: Crypts colonized by
      bacteria were observed in 42.9% and 3.6% of ASLC and IBD patients, respectively
      (P = 0.019). Crypt abscesses colonized by bacteria were observed in 28.6% and
      0.0% of ASLC and IBD patients, respectively (P = 0.035). CONCLUSION: These
      results do not support the hypothesis that crypt abscesses in IBD are the result 
      of localized dysbiosis arising from persistence of living bacteria colonizing the
      crypts.

TI  - Final adult height of children with inflammatory bowel disease is predicted by
      parental height and patient minimum height Z-score.
PG  - 1669-77
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21214 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was designed to elucidate the contribution of parental
      height to the stature of children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), who
      often exhibit growth impairment. Accordingly, we compared patients' final adult
      heights and target heights based on measured parental heights and examined
      predictors of final adult height in pediatric IBD patients. METHODS: We
      prospectively analyzed the growth of 295 patients diagnosed between ages 1 and 18
      (211 Crohn's disease [CD], 84 ulcerative colitis [UC]) and their family members
      (283 mothers, 231 fathers, 55 siblings). RESULTS: Twenty-two percent had growth
      impairment (height for age Z-score <-1.64, equivalent to <5th percentile on
      growth curve) in more than 1 measurement since diagnosis; most growth-impaired
      patients had CD (88% CD versus 12% UC). Parents of the growth-impaired group had 
      lower mean height Z-scores compared to parents of nongrowth-impaired patients
      (-0.67 versus 0.02 for mothers [P < 0.001]; -0.31 versus 0.22 for fathers [P =
      0.002]). For 108 patients who reached adult heights and had available parental
      heights, the growth-impaired group continued to demonstrate lower adult height
      Z-scores (-1.38 versus 0.07; P < 0.001). Adult heights were within 1 SD of target
      heights even for the growth-impaired group. Only 11.3% remained persistently
      growth-impaired in adulthood. Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated lower
      parental height and minimum patient height Z-score as significant predictors of
      lower final adult height in IBD. CONCLUSIONS: Parental height is a powerful
      determinant of linear growth even in the presence of chronic inflammation, and
      should be an integral part of the evaluation of growth in IBD children.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Polyamines are important in cell growth and wound repair, but have
      also been implicated in inflammation-induced carcinogenesis. Polyamine metabolism
      includes back-conversion of spermine to spermidine by the enzyme spermine oxidase
      (SMO), which produces hydrogen peroxide that causes oxidative stress. In
      ulcerative colitis (UC), levels of spermine are decreased compared to spermidine.
      Therefore, we sought to determine if SMO is involved in UC. METHODS: Colon
      biopsies and clinical information from subjects undergoing colonoscopy for
      evaluation of UC or colorectal cancer screening were utilized from 16 normal
      controls and 53 UC cases. Histopathologic disease severity was graded and the
      Mayo Disease Activity Index (DAI) and endoscopy subscore assessed. SMO mRNA
      expression was measured in frozen biopsies by TaqMan-based real-time polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR). Formalin-fixed tissues were used for SMO
      immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: There was a 3.1-fold upregulation of SMO mRNA
      levels in UC patients compared to controls (P = 0.044), and a 3.7-fold increase
      in involved left colon versus paired uninvolved right colon (P < 0.001). With
      worsening histologic injury in UC there was a progressive increase in SMO
      staining of mononuclear inflammatory cells. There was a similar increase in SMO
      staining with worsening endoscopic disease severity and strong correlation with
      the DAI (r = 0.653, P < 0.001). Inflammatory cell SMO staining was increased in
      involved left colon versus uninvolved right colon. CONCLUSIONS: SMO expression is
      upregulated in UC tissues, deriving from increased levels in mononuclear
      inflammatory cells. Dysregulated polyamine homeostasis may contribute to chronic 
      UC by altering immune responses and increasing oxidative stress.

      Immunosuppressants and biologic agents: should they or need they be used

PG  - S202-8
LID - 10.1016/S0399-8320(09)73155-0 [doi]
AB  - Although the use of concomitant immunosuppressants (IS) with biologics has been
      demonstrated to reduce the immunogenicity of chimeric (infliximab), humanized
      (natalizumab), human (adalimumab) antibodies and antibody fragments (certolizumab
      pegol), to date concomitant IS with biologics has not impacted on the short or
      intermediate responses in the treatment of Crohn's disease in most induction and 
      maintenance trials. The optimal strategy to reduce antibodies to infliximab is to
      use an induction and maintenance strategy rather than episodic therapy. Any
      potential benefit of concomitant IS use with biologic agents needs to be balanced
      against the risk of combination therapy including serious infections and the risk
      of neoplasia. The discovery of genetic polymorphism for production of thiopurine 
      methyltransferase (TPMT), a key enzyme in the metabolism of thiopurine
      antimetabolites, has made it possible to rationalize therapy in terms of patient 
      and dosage selection. TPMT screening prior to initiation of thiopurine
      antimetabolites is currently recommended to avoid treating patients with low or
      absent TPMT activity with potentially toxic doses of thiopurines. Routine
      monitoring of blood counts and liver enzymes is recommended even in individuals
      with normal TPMT activity. The ability to monitor thiopurine metabolites may make
      it possible to optimize therapeutic response by guiding clinicians on dose
      escalation.

AB  - Patients with chronic colitis (ulcerative colitis or colonic Crohn's disease)
      have an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). Although most of the molecular
      alterations reported in sporadic CRC have also been observed in
      colitis-associated CRC, they do not occur at the same timing and frequency,
      indicating a different pathophysiology. In particular, recent work highlighted
      the importance of chronic mucosal inflammation as a key factor favouring
      colorectal carcinogenesis in these patients. This may also be one of the reasons 
      explaining the role of 5-aminosalicylates as chemopreventive agents for CRC in
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with colonic involvement. Beside
      chemoprevention, colonoscopic screening and surveillance have been shown to be
      the cornerstone for CRC prevention and early detection in this particular
      patients' population. Periodic surveillance colonoscopy to detect dysplasia has
      been shown to decrease the mortality attributed to CRC. More recently, progress
      in imaging techniques increased our ability to identify dysplasia, and should
      probably now be considered to be an integral part of surveillance colonoscopy. In
      the future, further improvement of our knowledge of CRC biology, refinement of
      imaging techniques, as well as molecular discovery (e.g. identification of
      specific mutations in stool DNA extracts), might lead to develop more accurate
      diagnostic strategies to reduce the morbidity and mortality related to CRC in
      patients with ulcerative colitis or colonic Crohn's disease.

AB  - Rapid increase in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) incidence in
      developed countries, occurrence of CD in spouses and lack of complete concordance
      in monozygotic twins are strong arguments for the role of environmental factors
      in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Only two environmental factors have an
      established role in IBD. Smoking is a risk factor for CD and a protective factor 
      for UC; appendectomy is a protective factor for UC. Many other environmental
      factors for IBD have been investigated. These are infectious agents, diet, drugs,
      stress and socio-economic factors. They are detailed in this paper. Among them,
      adherent invasive E. coli, infectious gastroenteritis, oral contraceptives and
      antibiotics could play a role in CD. To date, three theories integrate
      environmental factors to pathogenesis of IBD: hygiene, infection and cold chain. 
      Much work remains to be done to identify risk factors for IBD. As exemplified by 
      smoking, research of environmental risk factors of IBD is useful since it may
      lead to an improved disease course among patients and perhaps, to appropriate
      prevention among predisposed subjects. Further studies in this field are eagerly 
      awaited.

AB  - The genetic component of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases is among the best known for 
      complex genetic disorders. If the functional candidate gene approach was rarely
      fruitful in the past, genome-wide scans allowed finding several susceptibility
      genes for Crohn disease including NOD2, IL23R, ATG16L1, IRGM, TNFSF15, a region
      close to PTGER4, PTPN2, PTPN22, NKX2-3 and many others. Only one gene, ECM1, has 
      been reported for ulcerative colitis alone. We now need to further explore these 
      new genes before to understand their biological role. However they clearly
      demonstrate the importance of innate immunity and autophagy for Crohn's disease
      and of the TH-17 differentiation for ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and
      other inflammatory disorders.

TI  - Guidance for substantiating the evidence for beneficial effects of probiotics:
      probiotics in chronic inflammatory bowel disease and the functional disorder
      irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 690S-7S
LID - 10.3945/jn.109.113746 [doi]
AB  - Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, the 2 distinct idiopathic pathologies of 
      inflammatory bowel diseases, are spontaneously relapsing, immunologically
      mediated disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. Selected probiotics strains
      have been proven to be clinically effective in maintaining remission in patients 
      with ulcerative colitis. None of the probiotics thus far tested has been shown to
      be effective in induction of remission or in maintenance of remission in patients
      with Crohn's disease. The multispecies probiotics mixture of 8 strains seems
      effective in the maintenance of remission in pouchitis. Irritable bowel syndrome 
      is a functional bowel disorder manifested by chronic, recurring abdominal pain or
      discomfort associated with disturbed bowel habit in the absence of structural
      abnormalities likely to account for these symptoms. Recently conducted
      appropriately powered studies with different (combinations of) probiotics show
      positive results on reduction of symptoms, although a considerable placebo effect
      is also found. Mechanistic studies aimed at pathophysiological mechanisms of
      inflammatory bowel diseases can identify new targets for probiotic bacteria.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Enterohepatic Helicobacter species (EHS) have previously been found in
      adults with hepatobiliary diseases. Here, we report the prevalence of
      Helicobacter pylori and EHS in liver and gastric tissue in children and
      adolescents with chronic liver disease (CLD). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy-seven
      consecutive children and adolescents with CLD with or without ulcerative colitis 
      or Crohn's disease (UC/CD) were investigated. Tissue samples were analysed using 
      a Helicobacter genus-specific 16S rDNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and 
      DNA-sequence analysis. Sera from 61 subjects were also analysed using enzyme
      immunoassay and immunoblotting. RESULTS: The Helicobacter PCR was positive in
      3/23 (13%) livers from patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis and UC, and
      in 1/2 livers from patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and UC. Sequenced PCR
      products matched the 16S rDNA of H. hepaticus, H. muridarum, H. canis, and H.
      pylori, respectively. H. ganmani and H. bilis were detected in gastric tissues
      from two AIH patients. H. hepaticus and H. pullorum were found in livers from two
      patients with acute liver failure and intrahepatic cholestasis. Antibody
      reactivity to Helicobacter cell-surface proteins was negative. CONCLUSIONS: H.
      pylori and EHS can be detected in the livers of some patients with UC and
      concomitant liver disease, as well as in other children with liver diseases.
      Multicentre studies from different locations are needed to find out whether these
      bacteria play a pathogenetic role or whether their presence is an epiphenomenon.

TI  - Simple score to identify colectomy risk in ulcerative colitis hospitalizations.
PG  - 1532-40
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21225 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients hospitalized for ulcerative colitis (UC) are at high risk
      for colectomy. Despite growing interest in research using administrative data in 
      inflammatory bowel disease, there is no available tool in such research to
      stratify disease severity or identify patients at high risk for colectomy.
      METHODS: Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) 2004, we identified patients
      hospitalized for UC flare through appropriate ICD-9-CM discharge diagnosis codes 
      (556.x). Our primary outcome of interest was undergoing total colectomy (45.8).
      Multivariate logistic regression models were constructed to identify independent 
      predictors of colectomy. From this, a cumulative risk score was developed.
      Hospitalizations were divided into 3 strata (low, intermediate, high) based on
      the odds of colectomy. RESULTS: There were a total of 15,142 hospitalizations
      with a discharge diagnosis of UC included in our study among whom 366 patients
      underwent total colectomy (2.4%). Anemia (odds ratio [OR] 2.13), requirement for 
      blood transfusion (OR 2.22), malnutrition (OR 4.53), and total parenteral
      nutrition (OR 4.30) were independent predictors of colectomy as were transfer in 
      from another hospital (OR 2.06) and admission to a teaching hospital (OR 1.73).
      The cumulative colectomy risk score ranged from 0-8, with significantly higher
      risk of colectomy in the high-risk stratum (13.7%) compared to the
      intermediate-risk (4.2%, P < 0.001) and low-risk (1.3%, P < 0.001) strata. The
      risk score performed well in its discriminative ability with an area under the
      curve of 0.70. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a simple and novel risk score to stratify 
      the severity of UC hospitalizations and predict colectomy in this population.

TI  - Clinical, endoscopic, and histological differentiations between Crohn's disease
      and intestinal tuberculosis.
PG  - 642-51
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2009.585 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The clinical, endoscopic, and histological features of Crohn's
      disease (CD) and intestinal tuberculosis mimic each other so much that it becomes
      difficult to differentiate between them. The aim was to find out clinical,
      endoscopic, and histological predictor features for differentiation between CD
      and intestinal tuberculosis. METHODS: We recruited 106 patients, 53 each with CD 
      and intestinal tuberculosis, in this study. The clinical, histological, and
      endoscopic features were subjected to univariate, bivariate, and multivariate
      analyses. On the basis of regression coefficients of the final multivariate
      logistic model, a score to discriminate between CD and intestinal tuberculosis
      was devised. For the validation of the score, the same model was tested on 20 new
      patients, each with CD and intestinal tuberculosis. RESULTS: On univariate
      analysis, although longer duration of disease, chronic diarrhea, blood in stool, 
      perianal disease, extra-intestinal manifestations, involvement of left colon,
      skip lesions, aphthous ulcers, cobblestoning, longitudinal ulcers, focally
      enhanced colitis, and microgranulomas were significantly more common in CD,
      partial intestinal obstruction, constipation, presence of nodular lesions, higher
      number, and larger granulomas were significantly more common in intestinal
      tuberculosis. On multivariate analysis, blood in stool (odds ratio (OR) 0.1
      (confidence interval (CI) 0.04-0.5)), weight loss (OR 9.8 (CI 2.2-43.9)),
      histologically focally enhanced colitis (OR 0.1 (CI 0.03-0.5)), and involvement
      of sigmoid colon (OR 0.07(0.01-0.3)) were independent predictors of intestinal
      tuberculosis. On the basis of regression coefficients of the final multivariate
      logistic model, a score that varied from 0.3 to 9.3 was devised. Higher score
      predicted more likelihood of intestinal tuberculosis. Once the cutoff was set at 
      5.1, then the sensitivity, specificity, and ability to correctly classify the two
      diseases were 83.0, 79.2, and 81.1%, respectively. Area under the curve for
      receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) to assess the ability of these features
      to discriminate between CD and intestinal tuberculosis was 0.9089. The area under
      ROC in the validation data set was 89.2% (95% CI 0.79-0.99). With a similar
      cutoff score of 5.1, sensitivity and specificity in the validation model were 90%
      (95% CI 66.9-98.2) and 60% (95% CI 36.4-80.0), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Blood
      in stool, weight loss, focally enhanced colitis, and involvement of the sigmoid
      colon were the most important features in differentiating CD from intestinal
      tuberculosis.

AB  - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, together popularly known as inflammatory 
      bowel disease (IBD), are characterized by a number of extraintestinal
      manifestations. Although infrequent, acute pancreatitis, and less often chronic
      pancreatitis, may occur as a result of the disease itself or secondary to the
      medications used in the treatment. The increased incidence of acute pancreatitis 
      in Crohn's disease can be explained based on the high predisposition to
      cholesterol as well as pigment stones as a result of ileal disease, anatomic
      abnormalities of the duodenum, immunologic disturbances associated with IBD, and,
      above all, to the side effects of many medications used in the treatment.
      Sulfasalazine, 5-aminosalicylic acid, azathioprine, and 6-mercaptopurine are well
      known to cause acute pancreatitis as a result of a possible idiosyncratic
      mechanism. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis share many clinical
      manifestations and treatment modalities. Nonspecific elevations of serum
      pancreatic enzymes in IBD make it difficult to avoid over diagnosis of acute
      pancreatitis, particularly in patients with Crohn's disease who suffer from
      abdominal pain often. The IBD-pancreas association is further reflected in many
      reports of exocrine as well as endocrine pancreatic insufficiency.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the evidence base for the medical
      (pharmaceutical and nutritional) treatment of paediatric inflammatory bowel
      disease. METHODS: Key clinical questions were formulated regarding different
      treatment modalities used in the treatment of paediatric (not adult-onset) IBD,
      in particular the induction and maintenance of remission in Crohn disease and
      ulcerative colitis. Electronic searches were performed from January 1966 to
      December 2006, using the electronic search strategy of the Cochrane IBD group.
      Details of papers were entered on a dedicated database, reviewed in abstract
      form, and disseminated in full for appraisal. Clinical guidelines were appraised 
      using the AGREE instrument and all other relevant papers were appraised using
      Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network methodology, with evidence levels
      given to all papers. RESULTS: A total of 6285 papers were identified, of which
      1255 involved children; these were entered on the database. After critical
      appraisal, only 103 publications met our criteria as evidence on medical
      treatment of paediatric IBD. We identified 3 clinical guidelines, 1 systematic
      review, and 16 randomised controlled trials; all were of variable quality, with
      none getting the highest methodological scores. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first
      comprehensive review of the evidence base for the treatment of paediatric IBD,
      highlighting the paucity of trials of high methodological quality. As a result,
      the development of clinical guidelines for managing children and young people
      with IBD must be consensus based, informed by the best-available evidence from
      the paediatric literature and high-quality data from the adult IBD literature,
      together with the clinical expertise and multidisciplinary experience of
      paediatric IBD experts.

TI  - [The risk factor for low bone mineral density in patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease].
PG  - 833-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of low bone mineral density in patients
      with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)and to identify its risk factors. METHODS: A
      cross-sectional survey was carried out in IBD patients. Anthropometric measures, 
      biochemical markers of nutrition and bone mineral density measurement were
      completed for these patients as well as healthy control subjects. RESULTS:
      Seventy-seven Crohn's disease (CD) and 43 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients were
      enrolled, and 37 healthy volunteers were recruited as healthy controls (HC). The 
      T value of CD patients, UC patients and HC was -1.72 +/- 1.20, -1.26 +/- 1.12 and
      -0.62 +/- 0.87 respectively and the T value of CD patients was significantly
      lower than that of HC (P = 0.000). The prevalence of osteoporosis in CD, UC and
      HC was 23.3%, 14.0% and 0 respectively. The prevalence of osteoporosis in CD was 
      higher than that in HC (P = 0.003). Logistic regression analysis indicated that
      low BMI (BMI < or = 18.4 kg/m(2)) was an independent risk factor for osteoporosis
      both in CD (OR = 11.25, 95%CI 3.198 - 39.580, P = 0.000) and in UC (OR = 14.50,
      95%CI 1.058 - 88.200, P = 0.045) patients. Age, disease duration, clinical
      activity active index (CDAI), oral steroid therapy, immunosuppressant treatment
      and serum vitamin D concentration were not found to be correlated with
      osteoporosis in IBD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Low bone mineral density is common in 
      both CD and UC patients and low BMI is an independent risk factor for
      osteoporosis in IBD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The significance of the association between many
      gastrointestinal pathologies and autism is yet to be discovered. The aim of this 
      report is to highlight an association between autism and microscopic eosinophilic
      colitis in 2 children. The possible mechanisms that may connect these two
      conditions are discussed. METHODS AND RESULTS: A rare association between autism 
      and microscopic eosinophilic colitis in 2 children is reported through
      retrospective chart review. Common causes of secondary eosinophilic colitis were 
      excluded. CONCLUSION: This report suggests the possibility of either impaired
      intestinal barrier function or an aberrant immune system that predisposes
      autistic children to sensitization to environmental antigens. Large controlled
      studies are needed to examine this hypothesis.

TI  - Tube feeding, the microbiota, and Clostridium difficile infection.
PG  - 139-42
AB  - Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is now the leading cause of nosocomial
      diarrhea in the USA, accounting for 30% of patients with antibiotic-associated
      diarrhea, 70% of those with antibiotic-associated colitis, and most cases of
      pseudomembranous colitis. The organism has evolved over the last 8 years to
      become more virulent and resistant to antimicrobials (NAP1/027 strain) causing a 
      more severe form of the disease that has increased mortality and healthcare
      costs. While it is generally accepted that the problem results from the overuse
      of antibiotics, and in particular second and third generation cephalosporins,
      fluoroquinolones and macrolides, recent studies suggest that acid suppression
      with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may be equally culpable. A further common, but
      less recognized, etiological factor is the prolonged use of elemental diets. Such
      diets are totally absorbed within the small intestine and therefore deprive the
      colonic microbiota of their source of nutrition, namely dietary fiber, fructose
      oligosaccharides, and resistant starch. The resultant suppression of colonic
      fermentation leads to suppression of the "good" bacteria, such as
      butyrate-producers (butyrate being essential for colonic mucosal health), and
      bifidobacteria and the creation of a "permissive" environment for C. difficile
      colonization and subsequent infection. Based on this analysis, the best chance of
      suppressing the emerging C. difficile epidemic is to adopt a 3-pronged attack
      consisting of (1) avoidance of the use of prophylactic antibiotics, (2) the
      avoidance of prophylactic PPIs, and (3) the conversion of elemental diet feeding 
      to a diet containing adequate indigestible carbohydrate after the first week of
      critical illness. In this review, we highlight the rising worldwide incidence of 
      C. difficile associated diarrhea and the role played by non-residue diets in
      destabilizing the colonic microbiota.

TI  - Combining nutrition, food science and engineering in developing solutions to
      Inflammatory bowel diseases--omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids as an example.
PG  - 60-72
LID - 10.1039/c0fo00057d [doi]
AB  - The Inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are
      debilitating conditions, characterised by lifelong sensitivity to certain foods, 
      and often a need for surgery and life-long medication. The anti-inflammatory
      effects of long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated acids justify their inclusion in
      enteral nutrition formulas that have been associated with disease remission.
      However, there have been variable data in clinical trials to test supplementary
      omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in inducing or maintaining remission in these
      diseases. Although variability in trial design has been suggested as a major
      factor, we suggest that variability in processing and presentation of the
      products may be equally or more important. The nature of the source, and rapidity
      of getting the fish or other food source to processing or to market, will affect 
      the percentage of the various fatty acids, possible presence of heavy metal
      contaminants and oxidation status of the various fatty acids. For dietary
      supplements or fortified foods, whether the product is encapsulated or not,
      whether storage is under nitrogen or not, and length of time between harvest,
      processing and marketing will again profoundly affect the properties of the final
      product. Clinical trials to test efficacy of these products in IBD to date have
      utilised the relevant skills of pharmacology and gastroenterology. We suggest
      that knowledge from food science, nutrition and engineering will be essential to 
      establish the true role of this important group of compounds in these diseases.

AB  - In patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis parenteral nutrition (PN)
      is indicated when enteral nutrition is not possible or should be avoided for
      medical reasons. In Crohn's patients PN is indicated when there are
      signs/symptoms of ileus or subileus in the small intestine, scars or intestinal
      fistulae. PN requires no specific compounding for chronic inflammatory bowel
      diseases. In both diseases it should be composed of 55-60% carbohydrates, 25-30% 
      lipids and 10-15% amino acids. PN helps in the correction of malnutrition,
      particularly the intake of energy, minerals, trace elements, deficiency of
      calcium, vitamin D, folic acid, vitamin B12, and zinc. Enteral nutrition is
      clearly superior to PN in severe, acute pancreatitis. An intolerance to enteral
      nutrition results in an indication for total PN in complications such as
      pseudocysts, intestinal and pancreatic fistulae, and pancreatic abscesses or
      pancreatic ascites. If enteral nutrition is not possible, PN is recommended, at
      the earliest, 5 days after admission to the hospital. TPN should not be routinely
      administered in mild acute pancreatitis or nil by moth status <7 days, due to
      high costs and an increased risk of infection. The energy requirements are
      between 25 and 35 kcal/kg body weight/day. A standard solution including lipids
      (monitoring triglyceride levels!) can be administered in acute pancreatitis.
      Glucose (max. 4-5 g/kg body weight/day) and amino acids (about 1.2-1.5 g/kg body 
      weight/day) should be administered and the additional enrichment of TPN with
      glutamine should be considered in severe, progressive forms of pancreatitis.

TI  - Outcome after surveillance of low-grade and indefinite dysplasia in patients with
      ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1352-6
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21184 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The management of low-grade (LGD) and indefinite dysplasia (IND) in
      patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) remains controversial, as outcomes after a 
      diagnosis of LGD or IND in previous studies vary widely. METHODS: All patients
      evaluated were from a single institution referral center who had a history of UC 
      and a diagnosis of either LGD or IND between 1994 and 2008 as confirmed by 2
      expert gastrointestinal (GI) pathologists. Data were collected by chart review of
      electronic and paper medical records. All patients who did not undergo a
      colectomy within 90 days of their dysplasia diagnosis were included in the final 
      analysis. Hazard ratios for risk factors as well as incidence rates and
      Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to calculate the progression to high-grade
      dysplasia (HGD) or colorectal cancer (CRC). RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were
      included in the analysis, of whom 2 patients with IND and 2 patients with LGD
      developed HGD or CRC over a mean duration of 49.8 months. In total, the incident 
      rate for advanced neoplasia for all patients was 2.7 cases of HGD or CRC per 100 
      person-years at risk. For flat and polypoid LGD the incident rate of advanced
      neoplasia was 4.3 and 1.5 cases per 100 person-years at risk, respectively.
      Patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) had an incident rate of 10.5
      cases per 100 years of patient follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: We report a low rate of
      progression to HGD or CRC in patients who underwent surveillance for LGD or IND; 
      polypoid dysplasia showed less risk of progression than flat dysplasia.

TI  - Luminal sulfide and large intestine mucosa: friend or foe?
PG  - 335-47
LID - 10.1007/s00726-009-0445-2 [doi]
AB  - Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) is present in the lumen of the human large intestine at 
      millimolar concentrations. However, the concentration of free (unbound) sulfide
      is in the micromolar range due to a large capacity of fecal components to bind
      the sulfide. H(2)S can be produced by the intestinal microbiota from alimentary
      and endogenous sulfur-containing compounds including amino acids. At excessive
      concentration, H(2)S is known to severely inhibit cytochrome c oxidase, the
      terminal oxidase of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, and thus
      mitochondrial oxygen (O(2)) consumption. However, the concept that sulfide is
      simply a metabolic troublemaker toward colonic epithelial cells has been
      challenged by the discovery that micromolar concentration of H(2)S is able to
      increase the cell respiration and to energize mitochondria allowing these cells
      to detoxify and to recover energy from luminal sulfide. The main product of H(2)S
      metabolism by the colonic mucosa is thiosulfate. The enzymatic activities
      involved in sulfide oxidation by the colonic epithelial cells appear to be
      sulfide quinone oxidoreductase considered as the first and rate-limiting step
      followed presumably by the action of sulfur dioxygenase and rhodanese. From
      clinical studies with human volunteers and experimental works with rodents, it
      appears that H(2)S can exert mostly pro- but also anti-inflammatory effects on
      the colonic mucosa. From the available data, it is tempting to propose that
      imbalance between the luminal concentration of free sulfide and the capacity of
      colonic epithelial cells to metabolize this compound will result in an impairment
      of the colonic epithelial cell O(2) consumption with consequences on the process 
      of mucosal inflammation. In addition, endogenously produced sulfide is emerging
      as a prosecretory neuromodulator and as a relaxant agent toward the intestinal
      contractibility. Lastly, sulfide has been recently described as an agent involved
      in nociception in the large intestine although, depending on the experimental
      design, both pro- and anti-nociceptive effects have been reported.

TI  - Impact of oral bisphenol A at reference doses on intestinal barrier function and 
      sex differences after perinatal exposure in rats.
PG  - 448-53
LID - 10.1073/pnas.0907697107 [doi]
AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA), a chemical estrogen widely used in the food-packaging industry
      and baby bottles, is recovered in human fluids (0.1-10 nM). Recent studies have
      reported that BPA is hormonally active at low doses, emphasizing the debate of a 
      risk for human health. Estrogen receptors are expressed in the colon, and
      although the major route of BPA exposure is food, the effects on gut have
      received no attention. We first examined the endocrine disrupting potency of BPA 
      on colonic paracellular permeability (CPP), experimental colitis, and visceral
      sensitivity in ovariectomized rats orally exposed to 5 mg/kg/d BPA (i.e., the no 
      observed adverse effect level), 50 microg/kg/d BPA (i.e., tolerable daily
      intake), or lower doses. BPA dose-dependently decreased basal CPP, with a
      half-maximal inhibitory dose of 5.2 microg/kg/d, 10-fold below the tolerable
      daily intake. This correlated with an increase in epithelial tight junction
      sealing, also observed in Caco-2 cells exposed to 10 nM BPA. When ovariectomized 
      rats were fed with BPA at the no observed adverse effect level, the severity of
      colitis was reduced, whereas the same dose increased pain sensitivity to
      colorectal stimuli. We then examined the impact of perinatal exposure to BPA on
      intestinal permeability and inflammatory response in the offspring. In female
      rats, but not in male rats, perinatal BPA evoked a decrease of CPP in adulthood, 
      whereas the proinflammatory response of colonic mucosa was strengthened. This
      study first demonstrates that the xenoestrogen BPA at reference doses influences 
      intestinal barrier function and gut nociception. Moreover, perinatal exposure
      promotes the development of severe inflammation in adult female offspring only.

TI  - [Inflammatory bowel disease--familial and sporadic form].
PG  - 1022-9
AB  - THE AIM: The aim of this thesis was to elucidate more differences between a
      familial and sporadic inflammatory bowel disease by comparing certain clinical
      data. METHODS: We assessed 248 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      observed in 1994-2004 in the Academic Department of Gastroenterology at the
      Medical Faculty in Hradec Kralove. To get information about the defined
      characters we obtained from the questionary and the hospital data. RESULTS: We
      did not identify any relationship between the onset of the disease and a certain 
      age group, yet males seem to be more prone to familial Crohn's disease. The more 
      frequent familial form of Crohn's disease was the fibro-stenotic one. There were 
      no differences in the onset of the disease. We did not prove the differences in
      extraintestinal signs, alergy and comorbidities. We did not find any differences 
      in therapy response in relation to the type of nutrition (enteral, parenteral)
      and the administration of immunosupresive drugs. The biological therapy in
      sporadic and familial Crohn's disease did not differ either. Surgical
      intervention was more frequent in Crohn's patients compared to the patients with 
      ulcerative colitis; yet no difference was identified between familial and
      sporadic cases. Appendectomy carried out before the onset of the disease was
      later diagnosed as Crohn's disease in more instances than ulcerative colitis.
      CONCLUSION: We did not prove significant differences comparing certain clinical
      data in familial and sporadic form of inflammatory bowel disease, yet males seem 
      to be more prone to familial Crohn's disease. Small bowel was involved more often
      in familial form of Crohn's disease than in sporadic form.

TI  - Clinical implications of mucosal healing for the management of IBD.
PG  - 15-29
LID - 10.1038/nrgastro.2009.203 [doi]
AB  - Mucosal healing (MH) has emerged as an important treatment goal for patients with
      IBD. Historically, the therapeutic goals of induction and maintenance of clinical
      remission seemed insufficient to change the natural history of IBD. Evidence has 
      now accumulated to show that MH can alter the course of IBD, as it is associated 
      with sustained clinical remission, and reduced rates of hospitalization and
      surgical resection. In patients with ulcerative colitis, MH may represent the
      ultimate therapeutic goal because inflammation is limited to the mucosa. In
      patients with Crohn's disease, which is a transmural disease, MH could be
      considered as a minimum therapeutic goal. This Review focuses on the definition
      of MH and discusses the ability of each available IBD medication to induce and
      maintain MH. The importance of achieving MH is also discussed and literature that
      demonstrates improvement of disease course with MH is reviewed. Finally, we
      discuss how best to integrate the treatment end point of MH into clinical
      practice for the management of patients with IBD.

TI  - Mechanisms of transcriptional modulation of the human anion exchanger SLC26A3
      gene expression by IFN-{gamma}.
PG  - G159-66
LID - 10.1152/ajpgi.00374.2009 [doi]
AB  - Two members of the SLC26 gene family, SLC26A3 or DRA (downregulated in adenoma)
      and SLC26A6 (putative anion transporter 1, PAT1), are known to play a major role 
      in apical Cl(-)/OH(-) (HCO(3)(-)) exchange process in the human intestine. We
      have previously shown the inhibitory effects of IFN-gamma (30 ng/ml, 24 h) on
      both SLC26A3 and A6 expression and promoter activity. We also demonstrated that
      the effects of IFN-gamma on SLC26A6 gene expression were mediated via IRF-1
      transcription factor. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the
      transcriptional modulation of SLC26A3 gene expression by IFN-gamma in the
      intestine are not known. The present studies were, therefore, designed to
      elucidate the signaling mechanisms and transcription factor(s) involved in
      mediating the inhibitory effects of IFN-gamma on DRA promoter (p--1183/+114)
      activity. Deletion analysis indicated that the IFN-gamma response element is
      located within the -1183 to -790 region, and sequence analysis of this region
      revealed the presence of potential gamma-activated site (GAS), a binding site
      (-933/-925 bp) for signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 1
      (STAT1). Mutations in the potential GAS element abrogated the inhibitory effects 
      of IFN-gamma. These studies provide evidence for the involvement of STAT1 in the 
      inhibition of SLC26A3 gene expression by IFN-gamma in the human intestine.

LID - 10.1586/egh.09.53 [doi]
AB  - Hepatobiliary disease is not uncommon in patients with inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD). The most common autoimmune hepatic associations are primary sclerosing
      cholangitis (PSC) and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). The immunosuppressant
      medications used in the treatment of IBD also have potential hepatotoxicity. PSC 
      is most commonly associated with IBD, specifically ulcerative colitis. AIH, a
      more classic autoimmune disease diagnosed commonly in isolation of other
      conditions in the same individual, is less commonly associated with IBD.
      Additionally, a subgroup of patients have features of both PSC and AIH, termed
      overlap syndrome, that is also sometimes seen in IBD patients. This review will
      discuss the most common liver disease associations seen in patients with IBD:
      PSC, AIH and overlap syndrome. Additionally, the most common drug-related
      hepatotoxicities encountered when treating IBD will be reviewed.

AB  - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are two forms of inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). Genetic and environmental factors influencing the onset and course
      of this disease have recently been identified. Among the environmental and
      dietary factors involved in the development of inflammatory colon diseases,
      dietary polyphenols have been proposed as protective agents in distinct models of
      colon inflammation. However, despite the huge number of studies on the beneficial
      effects of polyphenols on health, their dietary effectiveness is unclear. In this
      review, we examine some of the evidence linking dietary polyphenol intake with
      protection against IBD.

TI  - Anti-TNF antibody therapy for inflammatory bowel disease during pregnancy: a
      clinical review.
PG  - 234-41
AB  - The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; Crohn's disease, ulcerative
      colitis) is highest during the peak reproductive years, hence the increased
      concern with the safety of IBD drugs during pregnancy. Over the past 11 years,
      anti-TNF-alpha antibody therapy has emerged as a treatment approach for
      refractory IBD patients who have failed to achieve or maintain remission with
      corticosteroids and immunomodulator agents. The TNF-alpha inhibitors (anti-TNFs; 
      infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol) have proven successful in inducing
      and maintaining remission of moderate-to-severe IBD, but recommendations for the 
      use of these compounds during pregnancy have lacked consensus. Balanced against
      the potential risk of these drugs on the fetus is the well-established fact that 
      high disease activity has been found to poorly affect pregnancy outcomes in IBD, 
      and the potential use of anti-TNF agents may control disease flare and severity
      during pregnancy. Concerns regarding the effect of anti-TNFs on the pregnancy and
      fetus have been assuaged by registry data which has demonstrated an overall
      positive safety record. Both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the
      European Crohn's and Colitis Organization categorize anti-TNF agents as safe
      during pregnancy. New knowledge regarding the physiologic timing of placental
      transfer of therapeutic antibody subclasses and pegylated antibody fragments from
      the mother into the fetus has also helped to allay concerns. This review will
      examine the present state of knowledge regarding the use of anti-TNFs in pregnant
      women with IBD.

TI  - Mucosal bacterial microflora and mucus layer thickness in adolescents with
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 5287-94
AB  - AIM: To assess the mucosa-associated bacterial microflora and mucus layer in
      adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: Sixty-one adolescents
      (mean age 15 years, SD+/-4.13) were included in the study. Intestinal biopsies
      from inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa of IBD patients and from controls with
      functional abdominal pain were cultured under aerobic and anaerobic conditions.
      The number of microbes belonging to the same group was calculated per weight of
      collected tissue. The mucus thickness in frozen samples was measured under a
      fluorescent microscope. RESULTS: The ratios of different bacterial groups in
      inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa of IBD patients and controls were specific for
      particular diseases. Streptococcus spp. were predominant in the inflamed mucosa
      of Crohn's disease (CD) patients (80% of all bacteria), and Lactobacillus spp.
      were predominant in ulcerative colitis patients (90%). The differences were
      statistically significant (P=0.01-0.001). Lower number of bifidobacteria was
      observed in the whole IBD group. A relation was also found between clinical and
      endoscopic severity and decreased numbers of Lactobacillus and, to a lesser
      extent, of Streptococcus in biopsies from CD patients. The mucus layer in the
      inflamed sites was significantly thinner as compared to controls (P=0.0033) and
      to non-inflamed areas in IBD patients (P=0.031). CONCLUSION: The significantly
      thinner mucosa of IBD patients showed a predominance of some aerobes specific for
      particular diseases, their numbers decreased in relation to higher clinical and
      endoscopic activity of the disease.

TI  - Osteonecrosis in inflammatory bowel diseases: a review of the literature.
PG  - 327-34
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Osteonecrosis (ON) of the femoral head can lead to femoral head
      collapse, necessitating total hip replacement. Reports of patients suffering from
      both ON and Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) have prompted us to evaluate the
      relationship between ON and IBD, especially Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis. METHODS: A review of the data from three new cases, along with data from
      all the published cases of patients presenting ON and IBD found through a
      systematic search of the Pub Med database. RESULTS: We encountered some
      diagnostic problems: The ON diagnosis could not be confirmed in some patients who
      did not meet the ON diagnostic criteria. Reviewed data was too weak to assess the
      exact incidence of ON in IBD. Corticosteroid therapy, especially in high dose
      regimens, is likely the most important etiological factor. No evidence supporting
      other physiopathological hypothesis, such as total parenteral nutrition,
      osteoporosis, or coagulation disorders, was found. Finally, the multifocal form
      of ON appears particularly common in IBD, with some patients presenting multiple 
      lesions of the hip, shoulder, knee and talus. CONCLUSIONS: ON in IBD, which is
      frequently multifocal, appears to be a complication of corticosteroid therapy,
      especially when high doses are used. We recommend regular ON checkups for
      corticosteroid-treated IBD patients.

LID - 10.1159/000233291 [doi]
AB  - Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are chronic disabling lifelong diseases
      which may be disturbed by severe flares and anatomical complications requiring
      surgery. Until the very last years there was no clear indication that treatment
      was able to modify the long-term natural history of the disease. In particular,
      there are no data demonstrating a clear improvement through the period 1950-2003 
      in disease activity, occurrence of complications and need for surgery, in spite
      of an increased use of immunosuppressants since the 1990s. However, in
      inflammatory bowel disease, both thiopurines and methotrexate are very efficient 
      in about one half of the patients, and in responders, may heal the mucosa and
      decrease the need for surgery. The early use of immunosuppressants in selected
      patients may have an impact on occurrence of severe flares and complications, and
      need for surgery. Moreover, anti-TNF now used for 10 years in Crohn's disease and
      for 5 years in ulcerative colitis demonstrated in two thirds of the patients a
      remarkable anatomic effect, healing the mucosa, closing fistulae and preventing
      strictures. Infliximab does prevent endoscopic recurrence following ileal
      resection for Crohn's disease. Actually, because irreversible anatomical damage
      may develop during the first years of disease, there is a need to classify early 
      in the course of the disease patients who will benefit from anti-TNF and
      classical immunosuppressants, respectively. There is the need in the next few
      years to better define these subgroups and to compare different strategies within
      each group through randomized interventional studies.

TI  - Mesalamine inhibits epithelial beta-catenin activation in chronic ulcerative
      colitis.
PG  - 595-605, 605.e1-3
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2009.10.038 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Mesalamine is a mainstay therapeutic agent in chronic
      ulcerative colitis (CUC) in which condition it reverses crypt architectural
      changes and reduces colitis-associated cancer (CAC). The present study addressed 
      the possibility that mesalamine reduces beta-catenin-associated progenitor cell
      activation, Akt-phosphorylated beta-catenin(Ser552) (P-beta-catenin), and
      colitis-induced dysplasia (CID). METHODS: Effects of mesalamine on P-beta-catenin
      staining and function were assessed by immunohistochemistry and quantitative
      reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in biopsy specimens of 
      CUC in mild or "refractory" severe mucosal inflammation. Effects of mesalamine on
      epithelial proliferation and activation of Akt and beta-catenin were assessed in 
      interleukin (IL)-10(-/-) colitis and CID by immunohistochemistry and Western
      blotting. Dysplasia was assessed by counting the number and lengths of lesions
      per colon. RESULTS: Data from IL-10(-/-) and human colitis samples show that
      mesalamine reduced Akt activation and P-beta-catenin levels in the middle and
      upper crypt. Reductions in P-beta-catenin in CUC biopsy specimens with severe
      inflammation suggested that mesalamine reduced P-beta-catenin levels in tissue
      refractory to mesalamine's anti-inflammatory effects. In IL-10(-/-) mice,
      mesalamine reduced CID concordant with inhibition of crypt Akt and beta-catenin
      signaling. CONCLUSIONS: The results are consistent with the model that mesalamine
      contributes to chemoprevention in CAC by reducing beta-catenin signaling within
      intestinal progenitors.

AB  - In the course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) a number of extraintestinal
      manifestations are known to occur, being the dermatological ones often associated
      to both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Pyoderma gangrenosum and erythema
      nodosum are the most frequent, but there are other skin manifestations less
      frequently reported such as leukocytoclastic vasculitis. We present a case, in
      which Crohn's disease and leukocytoclastic vasculitis were simultaneously
      diagnosed, and corticoids treatment achieved complete remission of the both
      cutaneous and gastrointestinal manifestations.

AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are the two major forms of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and both diseases lead to high morbidity and
      health care costs. Complex interactions between the immune system, enteric
      commensal bacteria and host genotype are thought to underlie the development of
      IBD although the precise aetiology of this group of diseases is still unknown.
      The understanding of the composition and complexity of the normal gut microbiota 
      has been greatly aided by the use of molecular methods and is likely to be
      further increased with the advent of metagenomics and metatranscriptomics
      approaches, which will allow an increasingly more holistic assessment of the
      microbiome with respect to both diversity and function of the commensal gut
      microbiota. Studies thus far have shown that the intestinal microbiota drives the
      development of the gut immune system and can induce immune homeostasis as well as
      contribute to the development of IBD. Probiotics which deliver some of the
      beneficial immunomodulatory effects of the commensal gut microbiota and induce
      immune homeostasis have been proposed as a suitable treatment for mild to
      moderate IBD. This review provides an overview over the current understanding of 
      the commensal gut microbiota, its interactions with the mucosal immune system and
      its capacity to induce both gut homeostasis as well as dysregulation of the
      immune system. Bacterial-host events, including interactions with pattern
      recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed on epithelial cells and dendritic cells
      (DCs) and the resultant impact on immune responses at mucosal surfaces will be
      discussed.

TI  - Growth retardation in early-onset inflammatory bowel disease: should we monitor
      and treat these patients differently?
PG  - 404-11
LID - 10.1159/000228581 [doi]
AB  - Growth impairment and associated pubertal delay are common complications of
      pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly Crohn's disease (CD).
      Chronic undernutrition (related primarily to inadequate intake) and
      pro-inflammatory cytokines are the two major and interrelated contributory
      factors. Pathogenic mechanisms include interference with growth
      hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1 axis, with gonadotropin-releasing hormone
      secretion patterns, and direct cytokine effects on growing bone. Chronic
      corticosteroid therapy compounds disease-related causes of growth impairment. The
      influence on growth of polymorphisms in IBD susceptibility or modifier genes is
      under study. Accurate recognition of impaired growth requires appreciation of
      normal growth. Pre-illness standard deviation scores (SDS) for height should be
      obtained and compared with height SDS at diagnosis, so that the impact of disease
      on growth can be fully appreciated. The greater the deficit prior to recognition 
      of IBD, the greater is the demand for catch-up growth. Height velocity should be 
      regularly monitored and its adequacy for age and pubertal stage assessed.
      Restoration and maintenance of pre-illness growth pattern indicate success of
      therapy. Current treatment regimens limit use of corticosteroids, via
      optimization of immunomodulatory drugs, use of enteral nutrition in CD, and, if
      necessary, surgery for ulcerative colitis and for intestinal complications of
      localized CD. Biologic agents with the potential for mucosal healing hold promise
      of growth enhancement even among children, whose growth with previously available
      therapies remained compromised. For all therapies, there is a window of
      opportunity to achieve normal growth before puberty is too advanced.

TI  - Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease: is it different?
PG  - 212-4
LID - 10.1159/000228552 [doi]
AB  - The clinical manifestations of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)
      are highly variable, with significant diversity in phenotypes of the diseases.
      This diversity may manifest as a difference in age of onset. Pediatric-onset
      disease may present differently and have a different natural history, with
      ramifications for disease management. Clear evidence exists at present that
      pediatric-onset UC may be different than adult-onset UC. The primary difference
      in disease phenotype is extent of disease. Approximately 60-70% of patients with 
      pediatric-onset UC present with pancolitis, as opposed to approximately 20-30% in
      adults. Patients are more likely to have severe disease and become
      steroid-dependent. CD may be affected by an age gradient. There is an inverse
      linear relationship between age and colonic CD, the younger the patient, the more
      likely is the patient to have colonic CD. This inverse relationship is true
      through age 10. In addition, pediatric patients are more likely to have upper
      gastrointestinal involvement than their adult peers. Comparing adult and
      pediatric phenotypes is fraught with methodological obstacles. Disease behavior, 
      with the exception of growth failure, seems to parallel disease behavior in
      adults. Patients with growth retardation are a high risk group for complications 
      and should be managed as such.

TI  - Microscopic colitis in children.
PG  - 1996-2001
LID - 10.1007/s10620-009-0964-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microscopic colitis typically presents with chronic watery nonbloody 
      diarrhea with normal endoscopy findings but abnormal inflammatory
      histopathological findings. As it is mainly a condition of the elderly, pediatric
      data is scarce. AIMS: To describe and characterize children with microscopic
      colitis. METHODS: The pathology database at the University of Alberta Hospital
      together with the pediatric inflammatory bowel disease database at the Stollery
      Children's Hospital were both searched from September 1996 to May 2008. Charts of
      all children under the age of 17 years who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of
      microscopic colitis were examined. RESULTS: Eleven children (four girls, mean age
      at diagnosis 11.2 years, +/- 4.4 years) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The
      patients were followed up for a mean of 24.8 months (standard deviation, SD 15.2 
      months). Two patients were on proton pump inhibitors, two had stool organisms,
      and two had immunodeficiency. All patients had normal endoscopy and colonoscopy
      on visualization. Five patients were diagnosed with lymphocytic colitis and the
      rest had nonspecific/eosinophilic microscopic colitis. The majority of children
      responded to mesalazine. One patient with immunodeficiency was difficult to
      manage. CONCLUSIONS: Microscopic colitis is rare in children. Microscopic
      eosinophilic colitis is an underdescribed variant of microscopic colitis. The
      majority of children with microscopic colitis respond well to aminosalicylic acid
      (5-ASA) medications. Microscopic colitis associated with immunodeficiency can be 
      very challenging to manage. Large multicenter pediatric trials with long-term
      follow-up are needed to allow investigators to have a better understanding of
      this rare condition in children.

      this study. METHODS: Two hundred ninety-three patients with ulcerative colitis
      and 207 with Crohn's disease, referred to tertiary referral gastrointestinal
      centers in Tehran from 2004 through 2007, were assessed. Demographic and clinical
      features, intestinal and extraintestinal manifestations, inflammatory bowel
      disease in relatives, measles infection and vaccination, nutrition during
      infancy, and drugs and surgical interventions were assessed. RESULTS: The
      mean+/-SD age at the diagnosis was 33.8+/-12.9 years in Crohn's disease and
      37.1+/-13.7 years in ulcerative colitis. Male:female ratio was 0.9:1.0 for
      Crohn's disease and 0.7:1.0 for ulcerative colitis. A total of 177 (85.5%)
      patients with Crohn's disease, and 254 (86.7%) patients with ulcerative colitis
      had never smoked. Measles vaccination was mentioned in 150 (72.5%) of Crohn's
      disease and 214 (73%) of ulcerative colitis patients. Breastfeeding during
      infancy was reported in 178 (86%) and 257 (87.7%) of Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis patients, respectively. Appendectomy was reported in 37
      (17.9%) of Crohn's disease and 16 (5.5%) of ulcerative colitis patients, whereas 
      tonsillectomy was reported in 11.6% of each group. CONCLUSION: Demographic and
      clinical characteristics of inflammatory bowel disease patients are similar to
      that of other developing countries, in this study, more inflammatory bowel
      disease cases have been assessed in comparison with previous studies, which may
      be due to different time scales of socioeconomic evolution and environmental
      factors in Iran.

AB  - Dysregulation of intestinal epithelial cell performance is associated with an
      array of pathologies whose onset mechanisms are incompletely understood. While
      whole-genomics approaches have been valuable for studying the molecular basis of 
      several intestinal diseases, a thorough analysis of gene expression along the
      healthy gastrointestinal tract is still lacking. The aim of this study was to map
      gene expression in gastrointestinal regions of healthy human adults and to
      implement a procedure for microarray data analysis that would allow its use as a 
      reference when screening for pathological deviations. We analyzed the gene
      expression signature of antrum, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and transverse colon
      biopsies using a biostatistical method based on a multivariate and univariate
      approach to identify region-selective genes. One hundred sixty-six genes were
      found responsible for distinguishing the five regions considered. Nineteen had
      never been described in the GI tract, including a semaphorin probably implicated 
      in pathogen invasion and six novel genes. Moreover, by crossing these genes with 
      those retrieved from an existing data set of gene expression in the intestine of 
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease patients, we identified genes that might
      be biomarkers of Crohn's and/or ulcerative colitis in ileum and/or colon. These
      include CLCA4 and SLC26A2, both implicated in ion transport. This study furnishes
      the first map of gene expression along the healthy human gastrointestinal tract. 
      Furthermore, the approach implemented here, and validated by retrieving known
      gene profiles, allowed the identification of promising new leads in both healthy 
      and disease states.

TI  - Genetic analysis of MDR1 and inflammatory bowel disease reveals protective effect
      of heterozygous variants for ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1784-93
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21019 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the multidrug transporter
      MDR1 have been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in different
      studies. However, the data are highly controversial. Recently, 6 haplotype
      tagging SNPs (tSNPs), representing the haplotype variations of the MDR1 gene,
      were identified. The aims of this study were to genotype these variants and
      correlate them to disease phenotype in New Zealand IBD patients. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: A total of 784 IBD patients and 200 healthy subjects were genotyped for 
      5 tSNPs and the triallelic MDR1 variant G2677T/A using the Sequenom MassArray
      platform. Furthermore, the effects of these variants were examined in correlation
      with phenotypic clinical features. RESULTS: Heterozygous carriers for the
      variants C1236T, rs2235046 (an SNP in intron 16), and G2677T/A showed a lower
      risk of developing ulcerative colitis (C1236T: odds ratio [OR] = 0.63, 95%
      confidence interval [CI] = 0.42-0.93, P = 0.03; G2677T/A: OR = 0.59, CI =
      0.39-0.89, P = 0.02; and rs2235046: OR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.38-0.91, P = 0.009) as 
      compared with homozygotes. None of the analyzed markers were associated with
      Crohn's disease on a genotypic level. Subgroup analysis revealed an association
      for 2 variants with IBD when stratified for age of onset (C1236T SNP and
      rs3789243). The MDR1 variant C3435T was associated with disease behavior in CD
      (OR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.01-2.08, P = 0.04), whereas the SNP rs3789243 was found to
      be associated with pancolitis in UC patients (OR = 1.35, CI = 1.00-1.82, P =
      0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study support the role of MDR1 as a
      candidate gene for ulcerative colitis. Furthermore, our results suggest the
      possibility of a heterozygous advantage for certain MDR1 variants for this
      disease.

PG  - 653-60
LID - 10.1097/MCO.0b013e3283308dd6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To examine current evidence for dietary supplementation with
      zinc and other micronutrients for primary prevention of multiple micronutrient
      deficiencies that are known to result from therapies used in the treatment of
      gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiological
      observations and clinical findings have strengthened the concept that both
      nutritional deficiencies and nutritional excesses impair the gastrointestinal
      response(s) and alter susceptibility to inflammation and other diseases. The
      interaction of micronutrient intake, biochemical indicators of nutritional
      status, and four specific gastrointestinal inflammation states are reviewed.
      These conditions include celiac disease and concomitant micronutrient
      deficiencies resulting from the sustained adherence to a gluten-free diet;
      micronutrient nutrition as an important determinant of immunity for two major
      types of inflammatory bowel disease: ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease; and 
      HIV/AIDS-related diarrhea and concomitant micronutrient deficiencies which may be
      exacerbated by the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy. SUMMARY:
      For each inflammation 'state', enhancement of micronutrient status can improve
      immunocompetance and minimize therapeutic side-effects. The impact of
      single-micronutrient deficiencies on immune responses, and the possible impact of
      uncorrected micronutrient status are discussed.

PG  - 400-4
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181a0d269 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rifaximin, Food and Drug Administration approved for traveler's
      diarrhea, has been used in adult patients with active inflammatory bowel disease 
      (IBD). This retrospective review was undertaken to determine its role in the
      treatment of pediatric IBD. METHODS: A review of children with IBD, who were
      treated with rifaximin from 2005 to 2007 at our institution, was performed.
      Collected data included diagnosis, age, medication history, recent therapy,
      symptom, and interval to improvement. Response was rated as none, moderate, or
      optimum relief for each symptom. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were identified, 
      12 with Crohn disease and 11 with ulcerative colitis (UC) with a median age of 13
      years. The most common complaints were diarrhea in 20 patients (87%), abdominal
      pain in 17 (74%), and bloody stools in 15 (65%). Rifaximin was given at doses
      ranging between 10 and 30 mg/kg (Table 1). Of the 20 patients who presented with 
      diarrhea 5 (25%) had relief of diarrhea within 1 week of starting rifaximin and
      total of 12 patients (60%) experienced relief within 4 weeks. Abdominal pain
      resolved in 3 of 17 patients (17.6%) within 1 week and in 12 of 17 (70.6%) within
      4 weeks. Visible bleeding resolved in 10 of 15 patients (66.7%) within 4 weeks of
      therapy (Table 2). Analysis of concurrent medications showed 61% experienced
      relief of symptoms when addition of rifaximin was the only meaningful treatment
      change. CONCLUSIONS: Rifaximin was well-tolerated and showed favorable results.
      Larger doses of rifaximin were statistically better for abdominal pain. Further
      studies are needed to evaluate efficacy and optimal dosing of rifaximin in this
      population.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consists of two main disorders, ulcerative
      colitis and Crohn's disease, that cause chronic, recurrent inflammation of the
      intestine. An inappropriate immune response to the enteric ecosystem has been
      postulated to cause IBD. Genomewide association studies provide the information
      of diverse genetic variations and susceptibilities to patients with IBD. Through 
      the application of these studies, the pathogenesis of IBD may result in part from
      genetic abnormalities that regulate epithelial barrier function and innate and
      adaptive immune responses. Crohn's disease shows strong association with CARD15, 
      ATG15L1, and IRGM, which are involved in the innate immunity. In the adaptive
      immune response, IL23R, MST1, IL12B, and STAT3 polymorphisms are associated with 
      Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Current pharmacologic treatment of IBD,
      including 5-aminosalycylate, steroids, and immunomodulator therapy, are mainly
      aimed at suppressing inflammation non-specifically, except biologic therapies
      such as anti-tumor necrosis factor molecule, which block specific proinflammatory
      molecules. For nutritional issues in IBD, the mainstay of therapy has been
      supportive, with particular attention paid to the prevention, recognition, and
      therapy of nutritional deficiencies, and individual outcomes to specific dietary 
      factors have been controversial. Parenteral nutritional support and exclusionary 
      diets have been investigated and are not the subject of this review. The emerging
      concepts of nutrition-gene interaction gave birth to unique scientific fields,
      nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics. These studies provide information about 1) the
      genetic variability that induces an individual's response to nutrition according 
      to particular states of health and disease and 2) changes in gene expression that
      develop as a result of nutrition-gene interaction. For IBD, the role of diet in
      the regulation of the immune response against gut flora is the subject of current
      intensive evaluation. These approaches may lead clinicians to derive a
      personalized nutritional prescription based on individual genetic variations and 
      may result in a significant impact on IBD treatment.

TI  - Increased serum levels of L-arginine in ulcerative colitis and correlation with
      disease severity.
PG  - 105-11
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21035 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: L-arginine (L-Arg) is a semi-essential amino acid that is the
      substrate for both nitric oxide and polyamine synthesis. Cellular uptake of L-Arg
      is an active transport process that is subject to competitive inhibition by
      L-ornithine (L-Orn) and L-lysine (L-Lys). We investigated L-Arg utilization in
      patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Serum was collected from 14
      normal controls and 22 UC patients with pancolitis of moderate or severe activity
      by histopathology score. The Mayo Disease Activity Index (DAI) and endoscopy
      subscore were assessed. Serum amino acid levels were measured by high-performance
      liquid chromatography. Arginine availability index (AAI) was defined as
      [L-Arg]/([L-Orn] + [L-Lys]). RESULTS: Serum L-Arg levels were significantly
      associated with histopathologic grade (P = 0.001). L-Arg levels were increased in
      subjects with severe colitis when compared to those with moderate colitis or
      normal mucosa. L-Orn + L-Lys levels were also increased in severe colitis, so
      that AAI was not significantly increased. L-Arg levels were also strongly
      associated with the endoscopy subscore (P < 0.001). There was a strong
      correlation between DAI and L-Arg levels (r = 0.656, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS:
      Serum L-Arg levels correlate with UC disease severity but availability is not
      increased due to competitive inhibition by L-Orn and L-Lys. Our findings suggest 
      that L-Arg uptake by cells in the inflamed colon is defective, which may
      contribute to the pathogenesis of UC. Studies delineating the mechanism of uptake
      inhibition could enhance our understanding of UC or lead to novel treatment
      options.

TI  - Linoleic acid, a dietary n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid, and the aetiology of
      ulcerative colitis: a nested case-control study within a European prospective
      cohort study.
PG  - 1606-11
LID - 10.1136/gut.2008.169078 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Dietary linoleic acid, an n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid, is
      metabolised to arachidonic acid, a component of colonocyte membranes. Metabolites
      of arachidonic acid have pro-inflammatory properties and are increased in the
      mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis. The aim of this investigation was to 
      conduct the first prospective cohort study investigating if a high dietary intake
      of linoleic acid increases the risk of developing incident ulcerative colitis.
      DESIGN AND SETTING: Dietary data from food frequency questionnaires were
      available for 203 193 men and women aged 30-74 years, resident in the UK, Sweden,
      Denmark, Germany or Italy and participating in a prospective cohort study, the
      European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). These
      participants were followed up for the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. Each case 
      was matched with four controls and the risk of disease calculated by quartile of 
      intake of linoleic acid adjusted for gender, age, smoking, total energy intake
      and centre. RESULTS: A total of 126 participants developed ulcerative colitis
      (47% women) after a median follow-up of 4.0 years (range, 1.7-11.3 years). The
      highest quartile of intake of linoleic acid was associated with an increased risk
      of ulcerative colitis (odds ratio (OR) = 2.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) =
      1.23 to 5.07, p = 0.01) with a significant trend across quartiles (OR = 1.32 per 
      quartile increase, 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.66, p = 0.02 for trend). CONCLUSIONS: The
      data support a role for dietary linoleic acid in the aetiology of ulcerative
      colitis. An estimated 30% of cases could be attributed to having dietary intakes 
      higher than the lowest quartile of linoleic acid intake.

TI  - The effects of ageing on the colonic bacterial microflora in adults.
PG  - 653-8
LID - 10.1055/s-0028-1109055 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The composition of the fecal mircoflora and its changes on ageing
      have rarely been investigated in large samples of both patients and volunteers.
      METHODS: We analysed the fecal flora by conventional microbiological testing
      (Kyberstatus, Institute of Microecology, Herborn, Germany) of stool samples from 
      35 292 adults (age: 46.3 +/- 0.08 [18 to 96] years, 9564 males, 24 784 females;
      remaining = missing data) with different intestinal and non-intestinal diagnoses 
      for total colony-forming units (CFU) (per g stool) as well as relative abundance 
      of Bifidobacteria, Bacteroides spp., Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., and
      Lactobacillus spp. with respect to age, gender, and clinical data available (e.
      g., stool consistency and pH). RESULTS: The total CFU was stable and showed no
      age- or gender-related changes. Individual bacterial species constantly and
      significantly increased with age (E. coli, Enterococci spp.), or decreased at
      higher age (Bacteroides spp.), or were stable throughout the life span
      (Lactobacilli, Bifidobacteria). Gastrointestinal diagnoses (Crohn's disease, n = 
      198; ulcerative colitis, n = 515; irritable bowel syndrome, n = 7765; other GI
      diagnoses, n = 10 478) tended to exhibit some specificity of the bacterial
      profile, and when GI diagnoses were excluded, the age-related bacterial profile
      of the remaining group (n = 15 619, m:f = 4197:11 422) was not different.
      CONCLUSION: Conventional microbiological investigations of the fecal microbiota
      showed both bacteria-specific as well as a general pattern of ageing of the
      colonic microbiota, with the last decades (more than 60 years) demonstrating the 
      most profound changes. It remains to be shown whether these changes reflect
      direct changes of the gut microbiota, the mucosal innate immunity, or indirect
      consequences of age-related altered nutrition.

TI  - Potential for amino acids supplementation during inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 518-24
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21017 [doi]
AB  - The pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) is multifactorial and
      involves interactions of gut luminal content with mucosal barrier and especially 
      immune cells. Malnutrition is a frequent issue during IBD flares, especially in
      Crohn's disease (CD) patients, and nutritional support is frequently used to
      treat malnutrition but also in an attempt to modulate intestinal inflammation.
      The use of oral or enteral nutrition intervention in IBDs may be effective, alone
      or in combination with drugs, to achieve and maintain remission. However,
      standard diets are less effective than new-generation biotherapies and could be
      improved by supplementation with specific immunomodulatory amino acids.
      Experimental studies evaluating glutamine, the preferential substrate for
      enterocytes, are promising. Some clinical studies with oral glutamine in CD are
      until now disappointing, but new formulations and targeting could enhance
      glutamine efficacy at the site of mucosal lesions. The role of arginine, involved
      in nitric oxide and polyamines synthesis, still remains debated. However, the
      effects of these amino acids in IBD have been poorly documented in humans. Other 
      candidates like glycine, cysteine, histidine, or taurine should also be evaluated
      in the future.

AB  - Infection with the enteric pathogen enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC)
      causes a variety of symptoms ranging from nonbloody diarrhea to more severe
      sequelae including hemorrhagic colitis, altered sensorium and seizures, and even 
      life-threatening complications, such as hemolytic uremic syndrome and thrombotic 
      thrombocytopenic purpura. The more severe consequences of EHEC infection are
      attributable to the production of Shiga toxin (Stx) and its subsequent effects on
      the vasculature, which expresses high levels of the Stx receptor, Gb3.
      Interestingly, the intestinal epithelium does not express Gb3. Despite the lack
      of Gb3 receptor expression, intestinal epithelial cells translocate Stx. The
      effect of Stx on intestinal epithelial cells is controversial with some studies
      demonstrating induction of inflammation and others not. This may be difficult to 
      resolve because EHEC expresses both proinflammatory molecules, such as flagellin,
      and factor(s) that dampen the inflammatory response of epithelial cells. The goal
      of our study was to define the effect of Stx on the inflammatory response of
      intestinal epithelial cells and to determine whether infection by EHEC modulates 
      this response. Here we show that Stx is a potent inducer of the inflammatory
      response in intestinal epithelial cells and confirm that EHEC attenuates the
      induction of IL-8 by host-derived proinflammatory cytokines. More importantly,
      however, we show that infection with EHEC attenuates the inflammatory response by
      intestinal epithelial cells to its own toxin. We speculate that the ability of
      EHEC to dampen epithelial cell inflammatory responses to Stx and cytokines
      facilitates intestinal colonization.

TI  - Fish consumption and markers of colorectal cancer risk: a multicenter randomized 
      controlled trial.
PG  - 354-61
LID - 10.3945/ajcn.2009.27630 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diet is a major factor in the etiology of colorectal cancer, with
      high fish consumption possibly decreasing colorectal cancer risk, as was shown in
      several observational studies. To date, no intervention trials have examined the 
      possible beneficial effects of fish intake on colorectal cancer risk. OBJECTIVE: 
      The objective was to investigate the effects of a 6-mo intervention with oil-rich
      or lean fish on apoptosis and mitosis within the colonic crypt. DESIGN: In a
      multicenter, randomized, controlled intervention trial, patients with colorectal 
      polyps, inactive ulcerative colitis, or no macroscopic signs of disease were
      recruited (n = 242) and randomly allocated to receive dietary advice plus either 
      300 g oil-rich fish (salmon) per week (n = 82), 300 g lean fish (cod) per week (n
      = 78), or only dietary advice (DA) (n = 82). Apoptosis and mitosis were measured 
      in colonic biopsy samples collected before and after intervention (n = 213).
      RESULTS: The total number of apoptotic cells per crypt did not increase in the
      salmon or cod group: -0.10 (95% CI: -0.36, 0.16) and -0.06 (95% CI: -0.32, 0.20),
      respectively, compared with the DA group. The total number of mitotic cells per
      crypt decreased nonsignificantly in the salmon group (-0.87; 95% CI: -2.41, 0.68)
      and in the cod group (-1.04; 95% CI: -2.62, 0.53) compared with the DA group.
      Furthermore, the distribution of mitosis within the crypt did not significantly
      change in either group. CONCLUSION: An increase in the consumption of either
      oil-rich or lean fish to 2 portions weekly over 6 mo does not markedly change
      apoptotic and mitotic rates in the colonic mucosa. This trial was registered at
      www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00145015.

PG  - 294-300
LID - 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04062.x [doi]
AB  - The epithelium in inflamed intestinal segments of patients with Crohn's disease
      is characterized by a reduction of tight junction strands, strand breaks, and
      alterations of tight junction protein content and composition. In ulcerative
      colitis, epithelial leaks appear early due to micro-erosions resulting from
      upregulated epithelial apoptosis and in addition to a prominent increase of
      claudin-2. Th1-cytokine effects by interferon-gamma in combination with TNFalpha 
      are important for epithelial damage in Crohn's disease, while interleukin-13
      (IL-13) is the key effector cytokine in ulcerative colitis stimulating apoptosis 
      and upregulation of claudin-2 expression. Focal lesions caused by apoptotic
      epithelial cells contribute to barrier disturbance in IBD by their own
      conductivity and by confluence toward apoptotic foci or erosions. Another type of
      intestinal barrier defect can arise from alpha-hemolysin harboring E. coli
      strains among the physiological flora, which can gain pathologic relevance in
      combination with proinflammatory cytokines under inflammatory conditions. On the 
      other hand, intestinal barrier impairment can also result from transcellular
      antigen translocation via an initial endocytotic uptake into early endosomes, and
      this is intensified by proinflammatory cytokines as interferon-gamma and may thus
      play a relevant role in the onset of IBD. Taken together, barrier defects
      contribute to diarrhea by a leak flux mechanism (e.g., in IBD) and can cause
      mucosal inflammation by luminal antigen uptake. Immune regulation of epithelial
      functions by cytokines may cause barrier dysfunction not only by tight junction
      impairments but also by apoptotic leaks, transcytotic mechanisms, and mucosal
      gross lesions.

TI  - Luminal cathepsin g and protease-activated receptor 4: a duet involved in
      alterations of the colonic epithelial barrier in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 207-14
LID - 10.2353/ajpath.2009.080986 [doi]
AB  - Impairment of the colonic epithelial barrier and neutrophil infiltration are
      common features of inflammatory bowel disease. Luminal proteases affect colonic
      permeability through protease-activated receptors (PARs). We evaluated: (i)
      whether fecal supernatants from patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) trigger
      alterations of colonic paracellular permeability and inflammation, and (ii) the
      roles of cathepsin G (Cat-G), a neutrophil serine protease, and its selective
      receptor, PAR(4), in these processes. Expression levels of both PAR(4) and Cat-G 
      were determined in colonic biopsies from UC and healthy subjects. The effects of 
      UC fecal supernatants on colonic paracellular permeability were measured in
      murine colonic strips. Involvement of Cat-G and PAR(4) was evaluated using
      pepducin P4pal-10 and specific Cat-G inhibitor (SCGI), respectively. In addition,
      the effect of PAR(4)-activating peptide was assessed. UC fecal supernatants,
      either untreated or pretreated with SCGI, were infused into mice, and
      myeloperoxidase activity was determined. PAR(4) was found to be overexpressed in 
      UC colonic biopsies. Increased colonic paracellular permeability that was
      triggered by UC fecal supernatants was blocked by both SCGI (77%) and P4pal-10
      (85%). Intracolonic infusion of UC fecal supernatants into mice increased
      myeloperoxidase activity. This effect was abolished by SCGI. These observations
      support that both Cat-G and PAR(4) play key roles in generating and/or amplifying
      relapses in UC and provide a rationale for the development of new therapeutic
      agents in the treatment of this disease.

AB  - Undernutrition as well as specific nutrient deficiencies has been described in
      patients with Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and short bowel
      syndrome. In the latter, water and electrolytes disturbances may be a major
      problem. The present guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for the
      indications, application and type of parenteral formula to be used in acute and
      chronic phases of illness. Parenteral nutrition is not recommended as a primary
      treatment in CD and UC. The use of parenteral nutrition is however reliable when 
      oral/enteral feeding is not possible. There is a lack of data supporting specific
      nutrients in these conditions. Parenteral nutrition is mandatory in case of
      intestinal failure, at least in the acute period. In patients with short bowel,
      specific attention should be paid to water and electrolyte supplementation.
      Currently, the use of growth hormone, glutamine and GLP-2 cannot be recommended
      in patients with short bowel.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Exclusive enteral nutrition is used as primary therapy in
      Crohn's disease. Nutrition support is frequently required in children with both
      Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis when acutely unwell and during periods of 
      recovery. There is considerable controversy about nutritional needs during phases
      of active and inactive disease. It is, for example, often assumed that in acute
      illness a child requires increased nutritional support however the precise
      relationship between illness severity and energy expenditure is uncertain. This
      study explores the relationship between disease activity and resting energy
      expenditure (REE) in children with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Patients 
      were recruited from the regional paediatric gastroenterology unit at Southampton 
      University Hospitals NHS Trust. Disease activity was assessed using standard
      scoring systems (Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index; Simple Colitis
      Activity Index) and biochemical markers of inflammation (C-Reactive Protein,
      CRP). Fat free mass was estimated from skinfold thickness and Bioelectrical
      Impedance Analysis. Resting energy expenditure was measured by indirect
      calorimetry. A logarithmic correction and a linear regression model were used for
      analysis of REE corrected for body size. RESULTS: 55 children were studied; 37
      (67%) with Crohn's disease and 18 (33%) with Ulcerative Colitis. Median PCDAI was
      10 (range 0-60), 22 (59%) had PCDAI > or =10 (active disease). Median SCAI was
      1.5 (range 0-12). Within disease groups there were strong correlations between
      REE/KgFFM(0.52) and disease activity; PCDAI (r -0.386, p 0.018) in Crohn's
      disease and SCAI (r -0.456, p 0.057) in Ulcerative Colitis. In the cohort as a
      whole there was no increase in REE/KgFFM(0.52) with increasing CRP (r 0.129, p
      0.361). Using the regression model each mg/l increase in CRP was associated with 
      a reduction in REE of nearly 1.5 kCal/day. CONCLUSIONS: We were unable to
      demonstrate a significant relationship between REE and disease activity in
      children with inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Nutritional status and nutritional therapy in inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 2570-8
AB  - Underweight and specific nutrient deficiencies are frequent in adult patients
      with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In addition, a significant number of
      children with IBD, especially Crohn's disease (CD) have impaired linear growth.
      Nutrition has an important role in the management of IBD. In adults with CD,
      enteral nutrition (EN) is effective in inducing clinical remission of IBD,
      although it is less efficient than corticosteroids. Exclusive EN is an
      established primary therapy for pediatric CD. Limited data suggests that EN is as
      efficient as corticosteroids for induction of remission. Additional advantages of
      nutritional therapy are control of inflammation, mucosal healing, positive
      benefits to growth and overall nutritional status with minimal adverse effects.
      The available evidence suggests that supplementary EN may be effective also for
      maintenance of remission in CD. More studies are needed to confirm these
      findings. However, EN supplementation could be considered as an alternative or as
      an adjunct to maintenance drug therapy in CD. EN does not have a primary
      therapeutic role in ulcerative colitis. Specific compositions of enteral
      diets-elemental diets or diets containing specific components-were not shown to
      have any advantage over standard polymeric diets and their place in the treatment
      of CD or UC need further evaluation. Recent theories suggest that diet may be
      implicated in the etiology of IBD, however there are no proven dietary approaches
      to reduce the risk of developing IBD.

TI  - Gastrointestinal lesions associated with spondyloarthropathies.
PG  - 2443-8
AB  - Subclinical gut inflammation has been described in up to two-thirds of patients
      with spondyloarthropathies (SpA). Arthritis represents an extra-intestinal
      manifestation of several gastrointestinal diseases, including inflammatory bowel 
      disease (IBD), Whipple's disease, Behcet's disease, celiac disease, intestinal
      bypass surgery, parasitic infections of the gut and pseudomembranous colitis.
      Moreover about two-thirds of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug users
      demonstrate intestinal inflammation. Arthritis may manifest as a peripheral or
      axial arthritis. The spondyloarthropathy family consists of the following
      entities: ankylosing spondylitis, undifferentiated spondyloarthritis, reactive
      arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, spondyloarthritis associated with IBD, juvenile
      onset spondyloarthritis. This topic reviews the major gastrointestinal
      manifestations that can occur in patients with SpA and in nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs users.

TI  - PepT1 oligopeptide transporter (SLC15A1) gene polymorphism in inflammatory bowel 
      disease.
PG  - 1562-9
LID - 10.1002/ibd.20963 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human polymorphisms affecting gut epithelial barrier and interactions
      with bacteria predispose to the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) Crohn's disease
      (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The intestinal transporter PepT1, encoded by
      the SLC15A1 gene, mediates intracellular uptake of bacterial products that can
      induce inflammation and NF-kappaB activation upon binding to NOD2, a protein
      often mutated in CD. Hence, we tested SLC15A1 polymorphisms for association with 
      IBD. METHODS: Twelve SLC15A1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were
      genotyped in 1783 individuals from 2 cohorts of Swedish and Finnish IBD patients 
      and controls. An in vitro system was set up to evaluate the potential impact of
      SLC15A1 polymorphism on PepT1 transporter function by quantification of
      NOD2-mediated activation of NF-kappaB. RESULTS: The common allele (C) of a coding
      polymorphism (rs2297322, Ser117Asn) was associated with CD susceptibility both in
      Sweden and in Finland, but with genetic effects in opposite directions (risk and 
      protection, respectively). The best evidence of association was found in both
      populations when the analysis was performed on individuals not carrying NOD2
      common risk alleles (Sweden allelic P = 0.0007, OR 1.97, 95% confidence interval 
      [CI] 1.34-2.92; Finland genotype P = 0.0013, OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.44-0.90). The
      PepT1 variant encoded by the C allele (PepT1-Ser117) was associated with reduced 
      signaling downstream of NOD2 (P < 0.0001 compared to Pept1-Asn117). CONCLUSIONS: 
      A functional polymorphism in the SLC15A1 gene might be of relevance to
      inflammation and antibacterial responses in IBD. Whether this polymorphism truly 
      contributes to disease susceptibility needs to be further addressed, and should
      stimulate additional studies in other populations.

      effect on visceral sensitivity in mice.
PG  - 209-17
LID - 10.1016/j.pain.2009.04.017 [doi]
AB  - Elevated colonic luminal serine-protease (Ser-P) activity of diarrhea-predominant
      IBS (IBS-D) patients evokes a proteinase-activated receptor (PAR)-2-mediated
      colonic hypersensitivity in mice. Despite similarly elevated Ser-P levels in
      feces, patients with IBD exhibit visceral hypo- or normosensitivity to rectal
      distension, as opposed to IBS-D. To explain these discrepancies we studied the
      effect of colonic infusion of fecal supernatants from ulcerative colitis (UC)
      patients to colorectal mechanical sensitivity of mice and explored the
      involvement of PAR-4 and its activator Cathepsin-G (Cat-G). Fecal protease
      activities were assayed in healthy subjects, IBS-D and UC patients in presence or
      not of antiproteases or Cat-G inhibitor. Following intracolonic infusion of fecal
      supernatants from healthy subjects, IBS-D and UC patients or PAR-4 activating
      peptide (PAR-4-AP) or Cat-G, EMG response to colorectal balloon distension was
      recorded in mice. This nociceptive response was also determined after treatment
      with pepducin (PAR-4 antagonist) on UC supernatant or after a preincubation with 
      antiproteases or Cat-G inhibitor. In contrast to IBS-D supernatant, UC
      supernatant promoted colonic hyposensitivity to distension, an effect mimicked by
      PAR-4-AP or Cat-G. UC supernatant-induced hypoalgesia was inhibited by a cocktail
      of antiproteases. However, blockade of PAR-4 or Cat-G inhibition resulted in
      colonic hypersensitivity similar to that observed after IBS-D supernatant
      infusion. Despite similarly elevated Ser-P activities, IBS-D and UC fecal
      supernatant display visceral pro- and antinociceptive effects in mice,
      respectively. Visceral hyposensitivity induced by fecal supernatant from UC
      patients results from PAR-4 activation by cathepsin-G, counterbalancing the
      pronociceptive effect of simultaneous PAR-2 activation.

TI  - Probiotics, immune function, infection and inflammation: a review of the evidence
      from studies conducted in humans.
PG  - 1428-518
AB  - A number of studies have been performed examining the influence of various
      probiotic organisms, either alone or in combination, on immune parameters,
      infectious outcomes, and inflammatory conditions in humans. Some components of
      the immune response, including phagocytosis, natural killer cell activity and
      mucosal immunoglobulin A production (especially in children), can be improved by 
      some probiotic bacteria. Other components, including lymphocyte proliferation,
      the production of cytokines and of antibodies other than immunoglobulin A appear 
      less sensitive to probiotics. Probiotics, including lactobacilli and
      bifidobacteria, administered to children can reduce incidence and duration of
      diarrhoea, but the precise effects depend upon the nature of the condition.
      Probiotic supplementation can reduce the risk of travellers' diarrhoea in adults,
      but does not affect duration. The effect of probiotics on other infectious
      outcomes is less clear. Probiotics may benefit children and adults with irritable
      bowel syndrome and adults with ulcerative colitis; studies in Crohn's Disease are
      less clear. Probiotics have little effect in rheumatoid arthritis. Probiotic
      supplementation, especially with lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, can reduce risk
      and severity of allergic disease, particular atopic dermatitis; early
      supplementation appears to be effective. Overall, the picture that emerges from
      studies of probiotics on immune, infectious and inflammatory outcomes in humans
      is mixed and there appear to be large species and strain differences in effects
      seen. Other reasons for differences in effects seen will include dose of
      probiotic organism used, duration of supplementation, characteristics of the
      subjects studied, sample size, and technical differences in how the measurements 
      were made.

TI  - Long-term nutritional and clinical outcomes after serial transverse enteroplasty 
      at a single institution.
PG  - 939-43
LID - 10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2009.01.070 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Serial transverse enteroplasty (STEP) is a novel technique to lengthen
      and taper bowel in patients with intestinal failure. First described in 2003,
      initial data and reports have demonstrated favorable short-term outcomes, but
      there is limited published data on long-term outcomes of the procedure. Our aim
      was to assess clinical and nutritional outcomes after the STEP procedure.
      METHODS: After obtaining institutional review board approval, we reviewed all
      records of patients (n = 16) who underwent the STEP procedure at our institution 
      from February 2002 to February 2008. Patients were observed for a median time of 
      23 months (range, 1-71) postoperatively. Analyses of z scores for weight, height,
      and weight-for-height, and progression of enteral calories were performed using
      longitudinal linear models with random effects. RESULTS: Of the 16 patients (10
      male), the median age at time of surgery was 12 months (interquartile range,
      1.5-65.0). The mean increase in bowel length was 91% +/- 38%. After the STEP
      procedure, patients had increased weight-for-age z scores of 0.03 units per month
      (P = .0001), height for age z scores of 0.02 units per month (P = .004), and
      weight-for-height z scores of 0.04 units per month (P = .02). Patients had
      improved enteral tolerance of 1.4% per month (P < .0001). Six patients (38%)
      transitioned off parenteral nutrition (median, 248 days). Long-term complications
      included catheter-related bacteremia (n = 5), gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 3), 
      and small bowel obstruction (n = 1). Two patients ultimately underwent
      transplantation. There were no deaths. CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric patients with
      intestinal failure, the STEP procedure improves enteral tolerance, results in
      significant catch-up growth, and is not associated with increased mortality.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Takayasu's arteritis (TA) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic
      inflammatory diseases of unknown aetiology, and their coexistence is very rare. A
      14-year-old Turkish girl presented with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and
      weight loss. UC was diagnosed based on physical examination and laboratory
      investigations and was confirmed by colonoscopic biopsies. TA developed
      approximately 1 year later, and was diagnosed with angiography performed for
      ongoing severe abdominal pain in spite of well-controlled UC. Patients suffering 
      from chronic inflammatory diseases such as UC must be investigated for other
      inflammatory diseases such as TA, especially if the response to immunosuppressant
      therapy is unsatisfactory. CONCLUSION: Findings from our patients suggest that
      paediatricians must remain alert to the possibility of abdominal vasculitis in
      patients with UC and unresolved abdominal pain in spite of clinical remission.

PG  - 218-25

AB  - Clostridium difficile is responsible for a large proportion of nosocomial cases
      of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and pseudomembranous colitis. The present
      study provides evidence that yeast, beef and pork extracts, ingredients commonly 
      used to grow bacteria, can counteract C. difficile toxin A enterotoxicity in
      vitro and in vivo. In model intestinal epithelial cells the individual extracts
      could prevent the toxin A-induced decrease in epithelial barrier function and
      partially prevented actin disaggregation and cell rounding. Mice with ad libitum 
      access to individual extracts for 1 week had almost complete reduction in toxin
      A-induced fluid secretion in intestinal loops. Concomitantly, the toxin A-induced
      expression of the essential proinflammatory mediator Cox-2 was normalized.
      Moreover this protective effect was also seen when mice received only two doses
      of extract by intragastric gavage within 1 week. These results show that yeast,
      beef and pork extracts have the potential to counteract the intestinal
      pathogenesis triggered by C. difficile toxin A.

TI  - [Nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease].
PG  - 839-45
LID - 10.1556/OH.2009.28599 [doi]
AB  - Aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is complex and probably
      multifactorial. Nutrition has been proposed to be an important aetiological
      factor for development of IBD. Several components of the diet (such as sugar,
      fat, fibre, fruit and vegetable, protein, fast food, preservatives etc.) were
      examined as possible causative agents for IBD. According to some researchers
      infant feeding (breast feeding) may also contribute to the development of IBD.
      Though the importance of environmental factors is evidenced by the increasing
      incidence in developed countries and in migrant population in recent decades, the
      aetiology of IBD remained unclear. There are many theories, but as yet no dietary
      approaches have been proved to reduce the risk of developing IBD. The role of
      nutrition in the management of IBD is better understood. The prevention and
      correction of malnutrition, the provision of macro- and micronutrients and
      vitamins and the promotion of optimal growth and development of children are key 
      points of nutritional therapy. In active disease, the effective support of energy
      and nutrients is a very important part of the therapy. Natural and artificial
      nutrition or the combination of two can be chosen for supporting therapy of IBD. 
      The author summarises the aetiological and therapeutic role of nutrition in IBD.

TI  - Bone health in children with inflammatory bowel disease: adjusting for bone age.
PG  - 538-43
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e31818cb4b6 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Clinical results of bone mineral density for children with
      inflammatory bowel disease are commonly reported using reference data for
      chronological age. It is known that these children, particularly those with Crohn
      disease, experience delayed growth and maturation. Therefore, it is more
      appropriate to compare clinical results with bone age rather than chronological
      age. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Areal bone mineral density (aBMD) was measured using 
      dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, and bone age was assessed using the
      Tanner-Whitehouse 3 method from a standard hand/wrist radiograph. Results were
      available for 44 children ages 7.99 to 16.89 years. Areal bone mineral density
      measurements were converted to z scores using both chronological and bone ages
      for each subject. RESULTS: Areal bone mineral density z scores calculated using
      bone age, as opposed to chronological age, were significantly improved for both
      the total body and lumbar spine regions of interest. When subjects were grouped
      according to diagnosis, bone age generated z scores remained significantly
      improved for those with Crohn disease but not for those diagnosed with ulcerative
      colitis. Grouping of children with Crohn disease into younger and older ages
      produced significantly higher z scores using bone age compared with chronological
      for the older age group, but not the younger age group. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      findings, in accordance with those presented in the literature, suggest that aBMD
      results in children with Crohn disease should include the consideration of bone
      age, rather than merely chronological age. Bone size, although not as easily
      available, would also be an important consideration for interpreting results in
      paediatric populations.

PG  - S86-8
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181a15ca0 [doi]
AB  - Nutrition plays a role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) primarily in
      prevention and treatment of malnutrition and growth failure. Furthermore, in
      Crohn disease (CD), nutrition can induce remission, maintain remission, and
      prevent relapse. Malnutrition is common in IBD and the mechanisms involved
      include decreased food intake, malabsorption, increased nutrient loss, increased 
      energy requirements, and drug-nutrient interactions. At the time of diagnosis, up
      to 85% of pediatric patients with CD and 65% of those with ulcerative colitis
      (UC) have weight loss. Growth failure occurs in 15% to 40% of children with IBD
      and is less common in UC compared with CD, both at diagnosis and during
      follow-up. In CD, nutritional therapy with enteral formulas induces remission at 
      a rate comparable with that achieved with steroids. In adults with CD, limited
      information suggests that enteral nutrition (EN) may play a role in maintenance
      of remission. In children with CD colitis, one study suggested that children
      without colitis respond better to EN than children with colitis, and another
      study found no such difference but reported a trend toward earlier relapse in
      those with isolated colonic involvement. Finally, nutrition may play a role in
      IBD via the possible protective effect of breastfeeding against UC and CD. In
      summary, although only CD may benefit from nutrition as primary therapy for
      remission induction and possibly maintenance of remission, nutrition plays an
      important role in the prevention and treatment of malnutrition in IBD, and may
      have a protective role, via the effect of breast-feeding on disease occurrence.

PG  - S66-71
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181a118ef [doi]
AB  - Colon is a crucial partner for small intestinal adaptation and function in
      patients who underwent extensive small intestinal resection or transplantation.
      This short review deals with the different properties and roles of the colon in
      these settings, involving fluid and electrolytes absorption, absorption of
      medium-chain triglycerides, and production of short-chain fatty acids for
      malabsorbed energy salvage. The colon may adapt after small intestinal resection,
      whereas it hosts the most important part of the intestinal microbiota, which
      plays a crucial role in intestinal function and health. Also, colon may be
      responsible for D-lactic acidosis as well, as it can be injured by noninfectious 
      colitis. Finally, the relevance of a simultaneous colon grafting is discussed as 
      it is occasionally considered in specific patients requiring intestinal

TI  - Epidemiology of inflammatory bowel disease among children in Poland. A
      prospective, population-based, 2-year study, 2002-2004.
PG  - 121-9

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The incidence of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in
      Western countries is on the rise. No prospective studies have been conducted on
      the epidemiology of pediatric IBD in Poland. The aim of the study was to define
      the characteristics of new pediatric IBD and assess the incidence of new IBD
      among children in Poland between 2002 and 2004. METHODS: Patient records from 24 
      pediatric gastroenterology centers servicing the whole population of Poland were 
      collected. IBD diagnosis was based on clinical, radiological, endoscopic and
      histological features. RESULTS: There were 491 new IBD patients, representing an 
      overall incidence of IBD of 2.7 cases/100,000 children/year. The incidence of
      Crohn's disease (CD) was 0.6, ulcerative colitis (UC) 1.3, and indeterminate
      colitis (IC) 0.8. The age-related incidence of IBD was 1.8 in the 0- to
      10-year-old age group, rising to 3.7 for the 11- to 18-year age group.
      CONCLUSIONS: The overall incidence of IBD (as well as CD, UC and IC) in Poland is
      lower than that in Western countries. The relative contribution of UC and IC to
      the overall IBD incidence is higher in Poland than in most Western countries.
      These findings may suggest a tendency towards under- or misdiagnosis.

TI  - Increased CYP4B1 mRNA is associated with the inhibition of dextran sulfate
      sodium-induced colitis by caffeic acid in mice.
PG  - 605-16
LID - 10.3181/0901-RM-1 [doi]
AB  - Susceptibility to inflammatory bowel diseases depends upon interactions between
      the genetics of the individual and induction of chronic mucosal inflammation. We 
      hypothesized that administration of dietary phenolics, caffeic acid and rutin,
      would suppress upregulation of inflammatory markers and intestinal damage in a
      mouse model of colitis. Colitis was induced in C3H/ HeOuJ mice (8 weeks old, 6
      male/6 female per treatment) with 1.25% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 6 d in
      their drinking water. Rutin (1.0 mmol (524 mg)/kg in diet), caffeic acid (1.0
      mmol (179 mg)/kg in diet), and hypoxoside extract (15 mg/d, an anticolitic
      phenolic control) were fed to the mice for 7 d before and during DSS treatment,
      as well as without DSS treatment. Body weight loss was prevented by rutin and
      caffeic acid during DSS treatment. Colon lengths in mice fed caffeic acid and
      hypoxoside during DSS treatment were similar to DSS-negative control. Food intake
      was improved and myeloperoxidase (MPO) was decreased with each phenolic treatment
      in DSS-treated mice compared with DSS treatment alone. Colonic mRNA expression of
      IL-17 and iNOS were inhibited when IL-4 was increased by each phenolic treatment 
      combined with DSS, whereas CYP4B1 mRNA was increased only by caffeic acid in
      DSS-treated mice, compared with DSS treatment alone. Colonic and cecal
      histopathology scores of DSS-treated mice were significantly more severe (P <
      0.01) than in mice fed caffeic acid before and during DSS treatment, based on
      mucosal height, necrosis, edema, erosion, and inflammatory cell infiltration.
      Although both rutin and caffeic acid suppressed the expression of selected
      inflammatory markers, only caffeic acid protected against DSS-induced colitis, in
      association with normalization of CYP4B1 expression. The inhibition of
      DSS-induced colitic pathology by caffeic acid was mediated by mechanisms in
      addition to anti-inflammatory effects that deserve further study.

TI  - Glutathione peroxidases in different stages of carcinogenesis.
PG  - 1555-68
LID - 10.1016/j.bbagen.2009.03.006 [doi]
AB  - Cancer cells produce high amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and evade
      apoptosis. Hydroperoxides support proliferation, invasion, migration and
      angiogenesis, but at higher levels induce apoptosis, thus being pro- and
      anti-carcinogenic. Accordingly, glutathione peroxidases (GPxs) regulating
      hydroperoxide levels might have dual roles too. GPx1, clearly an antioxidant
      enzyme, is down-regulated in many cancer cells. Its main role would be prevention
      of cancer initiation by ROS-mediated DNA damage. GPx2 is up-regulated in cancer
      cells. GPx1/GPx2 double knockout mice develop colitis and intestinal cancer.
      However, GPx2 knockdown cancer cells grow better in vitro and in vivo probably
      reflecting the physiological role of GPx2 in intestinal mucosa homeostasis. GPx2 
      counteracts COX-2 expression and PGE(2) production, which explains its potential 
      to inhibit migration and invasion of cultured cancer cells. Overexpression of
      GPx3 inhibits tumor growth and metastasis. GPx4 is decreased in cancer tissues.
      GPx4-overexpressing cancer cells have low COX-2 activity and tumors derived
      therefrom are smaller than from control cells and do not metastasize.
      Collectively, GPxs prevent cancer initiation by removing hydroperoxides. GPx4
      inhibits but GPx2 supports growth of established tumors. Metastasis, but also
      apoptosis, is inhibited by all GPxs. GPx-mediated regulation of COX/LOX
      activities may be relevant to early stages of inflammation-mediated
      carcinogenesis.

      population-based New Zealand cohort.
PG  - 440-6
LID - 10.1016/j.humimm.2009.03.002 [doi]
AB  - Bacterial sensing is crucial for appropriate response by the innate and adaptive 
      immune system against invading microorganisms. Single nucleotide polymorphisms
      (SNPs) in genes involved in bacterial recognition, CARD15 and TLR4, increased the
      risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in a New Zealand Caucasian case-control 
      cohort. We now consider the effects of SNPs in CD14, TLR9, and BPI, analyzed
      individually, in association with one another, and with SNPs in CARD15 or TLR4 in
      this same population group. SNPs in CD14 (c.-159 C>T), TLR9 (c.-1237T>C) and BPI 
      (c.645A>G) showed no significant allele or genotype frequency differences between
      IBD cases and controls. Genotype-phenotype mapping reveals an association with
      BPI and ileocolonic Crohn's disease (CD) as well as an association with CD14 and 
      early-onset ulcerative colitis (UC). Genotype interaction analyses using three
      different statistical approaches provided significant evidence of interaction for
      the following combinations: CARD15/TLR4 (CD and UC), CARD15/CD14 (CD and UC),
      CD14/TLR4 (UC only), and CD14/BPI (UC only). A trend for an association between
      BPI and TLR4 was observed in UC patients, but failed to reach statistical
      significance. Our findings support the idea of gene-gene interactions for genes
      involved in closely related pathways (i.e. bacterial detection). There is
      evidence that carrying two SNPs in genes may lead to statistical significance for
      genes and SNPs that do not otherwise confirm as risk alleles for disease
      aetiology when analysed alone.

TI  - Factors predictive of Crohn disease following colectomy in medically refractory
      pediatric colitis.
PG  - 283-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Crohn disease (CD) has been diagnosed following colectomy for
      ulcerative colitis (UC). This study aims to determine the frequency of this
      occurrence, and to identify predictive factors leading to a CD diagnosis.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed in patients who
      have undergone colectomy. RESULTS: From 1996 to 2006, colectomy was performed in 
      212 patients, 37 of whom were diagnosed preoperatively with UC. The mean ages at 
      diagnosis and at colectomy were 10.6+/-4.3 years and 13.7+/-3.7 years,
      respectively. Inflammatory bowel disease serology at diagnosis in 29 patients
      showed that 26 (90%) were pANCA+. Serology was negative in 3. Ten (27%) had
      nonspecific inflammation of the upper digestive tract. Radiographs in 25 patients
      indicated no abnormalities in the small intestine. Before colectomy, patients
      (n=35) were treated with corticosteroid (97%), 5-ASA (69%), immunomodulator
      (66%), infliximab (29%), and cyclosporin (11%). The mean postoperative follow-up 
      was 2.6+/-2 years. Six patients (16%) were found to have CD. All 6 patients were 
      pANCA+ with elevated anti-OmpC (n=4), ASCA immunoglobulin A (n=2), and ASCA
      immunoglobulin G (n=1). The CD group had higher mean anti-OmpC compared with the 
      UC group, 16.9+/-5.2 and 6.2+/-3.4, respectively (P<0.005). Weight z score at
      time of surgery was lower in the CD group (-1.38+/-0.79) than in the UC group
      (0.29+/-0.24), P<0.05. CONCLUSIONS: The possibility of CD remains in a small
      fraction of patients who undergo colectomy for medically refractory UC. A lower
      weight and a higher anti-OmpC titer may be predictive of CD.

TI  - Pediatric inflammatory bowel diseases and the risk of lymphoma: should we revise 
      our treatment strategies?
PG  - 257-67
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are lifelong inflammatory gastrointestinal
      diseases starting in about one third of patients during childhood. Treatment
      strategies aim to control this chronic inflammatory process. Owing to recent
      advances in the understanding of IBD, immunosuppressive agents (mainly against
      TNFalpha directed) as well as biological drugs are more and more often used. This
      therapeutic approach clearly improved the clinical condition of the majority of
      patients with IBD. However, with this more aggressive treatment strategy, safety 
      concerns clearly arise. Recently, the description of a series of a particularly
      severe form of T cell lymphoma in pediatric and young adult patients with IBD
      under immunomodulator and biological combination therapy raised the question of
      the risks of treatment-induced side effects or complications. As reviewed in the 
      present article, there is a slightly increased risk of not only lymphoma
      development in IBD patients, potentially related to the inflammatory process, but
      also to the use of immunosuppressive therapies. On the basis of the literature
      data, were analyzed current treatment strategies for children with
      moderate-to-severe IBD, who are candidates to receive immunomodulator and/or
      biological agents potentially accelerating the risk of lymphoma development.
      Comparative clinical studies in IBD are still missing; however, it is prudent to 
      think about adapting immunosuppressive therapies to the inflammatory process of
      the underlying disorder and if possible to reduce them to monotherapy.
      Alternative treatment strategies for heavy immunosuppression exist (eg, enteral
      nutrition in Crohn disease or colectomy in patients with ulcerative colitis) and 
      should be considered whenever appropriate. There is a major need for comparative 
      studies before evidence-based guidelines can be established for safest and best
      treatment strategies of pediatric patients with IBD.

TI  - CD68 expression is markedly different in Crohn's disease and the colitis
      associated with chronic granulomatous disease.
PG  - 1213-7
LID - 10.1002/ibd.20890 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare inherited
      immunodeficiency disorder characterized by inability of phagocytes to kill
      certain bacteria and fungi. Histology from colon biopsies of CGD patients have
      shown the presence of inflammation and granulomas, almost indistinguishable from 
      the findings seen in Crohn's disease. We sought to determine if there were any
      differences in the cell types that comprise the inflammatory infiltrates in
      inflamed colon specimens between the 2 diseases. The objective was to determine
      whether the pattern of inflammatory cell composition could be used to distinguish
      CGD-associated colitis from Crohn's colitis. METHODS: Biopsies from 6 patients
      with Crohn's disease, 6 patients with CGD, and 6 control patients were stained
      with antibodies to CD3, CD4, CD8, CD68, CD79, CD163, and Foxp3. Positively
      staining cells per mm(2) of lamina propria were calculated for each antibody,
      with the exception of CD163, in which a percent area of lamina propria stained
      was calculated. RESULTS: There was a marked difference in the average CD68+ cells
      per mm(2) of lamina propria between the 2 groups (Crohn's: 1104.2 cells/mm(2);
      CGD: 242.3 cells/mm(2), P < 0.0004) and a significant difference between the CGD 
      group and control group (Control: 565.4 cells/mm(2), CGD: 242.3 cells/mm(2), P = 
      0.0072). There were no significant differences between Crohn's and CGD biopsies
      in the other cell types. CONCLUSIONS: This phenomenon provides physicians with a 
      simple and valuable tool to identify CGD in patients with colonic inflammation.

TI  - A dynamic model of colonic concentrations of delayed-release 5-aminosalicylic
      acid (Asacol).
PG  - 1193-201
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2009.03968.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: 5-ASA in a pH sensitive tablet (Asacol) is administered as three
      doses/day to treat ulcerative colitis. Once daily dosing may improve patient
      adherence. Simulation of colonic levels of 5-ASA can be used to compare dosing
      regimens. AIM: To create a dynamic model of colonic concentrations of
      delayed-release 5-aminosalicylic acid (Asacol). METHODS: Using published data, we
      created a computer model with STELLA software to simulate amounts of colonic
      5-ASA in the total colon, right, transverse, descending and sigmoid/rectum after 
      daily and three time/day Asacol. RESULTS: The model predicted similar total and
      regional amounts of 5-ASA with both regimens. Distribution of 5-ASA was 38% in
      the right colon, 33% in the transverse colon and 14% each in the descending and
      sigmoid/rectal colon. Simulated increases in colonic motility and defecation rate
      exaggerated this 5-ASA distribution, resulting in negligible amounts of 5-ASA in 
      the sigmoid/rectal region. CONCLUSIONS: This computer model suggests that Asacol 
      can be administered as a single daily dose. The model supports experimental and
      clinical observations that alternate dose or route of administration may be
      necessary to achieve adequate 5-ASA amounts in the distal colon during acute
      exacerbations of ulcerative colitis. This simulation cannot account for all
      sources of variability in the clinical setting, but provides a rationale for
      further investigation.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial on the efficacy of synbiotic versus probiotic or
      prebiotic treatment to improve the quality of life in patients with ulcerative
      colitis.
PG  - 520-5
LID - 10.1016/j.nut.2008.11.017 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Studies suggest that synbiotic therapy could prove more effective in
      the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) than therapies limited to probiotics or 
      prebiotics. This study compared the effect of each of these therapies in the
      treatment of UC. METHODS: One hundred twenty outpatients with UC were randomly
      sorted into three groups of 40 patients each for probiotic, prebiotic, or
      synbiotic therapy. The probiotic group ingested one daily capsule consisting of
      Bifidobacterium longum 2 x 10(9) colony-forming units and the prebiotic group
      ingested daily 8.0-g doses of psyllium. The synbiotic group underwent both
      treatments. All patients completed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaires
      (IBDQs) at the onset of the trial, at the 2-wk midpoint, and at the 4-wk end of
      the trial. Blood variables were also evaluated in a subset of 32 patients
      randomly selected from all groups and values were compared with IBDQ scores.
      RESULTS: Thirty-one patients in the probiotic group, 31 in the prebiotic group,
      and 32 in the synbiotic group qualified for analyses. The remaining 26 patients
      had incomplete questionnaires. Total IBDQ scores improved within groups by the
      end of the trial (probiotics 162 to 169, NS; prebiotics 174 to 182, NS;
      synbiotics 168 to 176, P = 0.03). Individual scores improved as follows:
      probiotics, emotional function (P = 0.03); prebiotics, bowel function (P = 0.04);
      and synbiotics, systemic and social functions (P = 0.008 and P = 0.02).
      C-reactive protein decreased significantly only with synbiotic therapy (from 0.59
      to 0.14 mg/dL, P = 0.04). There were no adverse events. CONCLUSION: Patients with
      UC on synbiotic therapy experienced greater quality-of-life changes than patients
      on probiotic or prebiotic treatment. These data suggest that synbiotic therapy
      may have a synergistic effect in the treatment of UC.

TI  - Post-translational inhibition of IP-10 secretion in IEC by probiotic bacteria:
      impact on chronic inflammation.
PG  - e4365
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0004365 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical and experimental studies suggest that the probiotic mixture 
      VSL#3 has protective activities in the context of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD). The aim of the study was to reveal bacterial strain-specific molecular
      mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory potential of VSL#3 in intestinal
      epithelial cells (IEC). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: VSL#3 inhibited
      TNF-induced secretion of the T-cell chemokine interferon-inducible protein
      (IP-10) in Mode-K cells. Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) cell surface proteins
      were identified as active anti-inflammatory components of VSL#3. Interestingly,
      L. casei failed to block TNF-induced IP-10 promoter activity or IP-10 gene
      transcription at the mRNA expression level but completely inhibited IP-10 protein
      secretion as well as IP-10-mediated T-cell transmigration. Kinetic studies,
      pulse-chase experiments and the use of a pharmacological inhibitor for the export
      machinery (brefeldin A) showed that L. casei did not impair initial IP-10
      production but decreased intracellular IP-10 protein stability as a result of
      blocked IP-10 secretion. Although L. casei induced IP-10 ubiquitination, the
      inhibition of proteasomal or lysosomal degradation did not prevent the loss of
      intracellular IP-10. Most important for the mechanistic understanding, the
      inhibition of vesicular trafficking by 3-methyladenine (3-MA) inhibited IP-10 but
      not IL-6 expression, mimicking the inhibitory effects of L. casei. These findings
      suggest that L. casei impairs vesicular pathways important for the secretion of
      IP-10, followed by subsequent degradation of the proinflammatory chemokine.
      Feeding studies in TNF(DeltaARE) and IL-10(-/-) mice revealed a
      compartimentalized protection of VSL#3 on the development of cecal but not on
      ileal or colonic inflammation. Consistent with reduced tissue pathology in
      IL-10(-/-) mice, IP-10 protein expression was reduced in primary epithelial
      cells. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrate segment specific effects of
      probiotic intervention that correlate with reduced IP-10 protein expression in
      the native epithelium. Furthermore, we revealed post-translational degradation of
      IP-10 protein in IEC to be the molecular mechanism underlying the
      anti-inflammatory effect.

TI  - Induction of persistent colitis by a human commensal, enterotoxigenic Bacteroides
      fragilis, in wild-type C57BL/6 mice.
PG  - 1708-18
LID - 10.1128/IAI.00814-08 [doi]
AB  - Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) causes diarrhea and is implicated in 
      inflammatory bowel diseases and colorectal cancer. The only known ETBF virulence 
      factor is the Bacteroides fragilis toxin (BFT), which induces E-cadherin
      cleavage, interleukin-8 secretion, and epithelial cell proliferation. A murine
      model for ETBF has not been characterized. Specific pathogen-free (SPF) C57BL/6J 
      or germfree 129S6/SvEv mice were orally inoculated with wild-type ETBF (WT-ETBF) 
      strains, a nontoxigenic WT strain of B. fragilis (WT-NTBF), WT-NTBF
      overexpressing bft (rETBF), or WT-NTBF overexpressing a biologically inactive
      mutated bft (rNTBF). In SPF and germfree mice, ETBF caused colitis but was lethal
      only in germfree mice. Colonic histopathology demonstrated mucosal thickening
      with inflammatory cell infiltration, crypt abscesses, and epithelial cell
      exfoliation, erosion, and ulceration. SPF mice colonized with rETBF mimicked
      WT-ETBF, whereas rNTBF caused no histopathology. Intestinal epithelial E-cadherin
      was rapidly cleaved in vivo in WT-ETBF-colonized mice and in vitro in intestinal 
      tissues cultured with purified BFT. ETBF mice colonized for 16 months exhibited
      persistent colitis. BFT did not directly induce lymphocyte proliferation,
      dendritic cell stimulation, or Toll-like receptor activation. In conclusion,
      WT-ETBF induced acute then persistent colitis in SPF mice and rapidly lethal
      colitis in WT germfree mice. Our data support the hypothesis that chronic
      colonization with the human commensal ETBF can induce persistent, subclinical
      colitis in humans.

TI  - Mercaptopurine treatment should be considered in azathioprine intolerant patients
      with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 654-61
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2008.03925.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adverse drug reactions are a significant reason for therapeutic
      failure during thiopurine treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. Some smaller
      series in this patient population have shown that a switch to mercaptopurine may 
      be successful in many cases of azathioprine intolerance. AIM: To assess the
      long-term outcome of mercaptopurine treatment in a large patient population with 
      azathioprine intolerance. METHODS: We identified 135 patients (74 women; median
      age 40 years) with Crohn's disease (n = 88) or ulcerative colitis (n = 47) and
      reviewed their medical records. RESULTS: A total of 70 patients (52%) tolerated
      mercaptopurine and were followed up for 736 (362-1080) days; 65 patients
      discontinued mercaptopurine due to adverse events after 25 (8-92) days.
      Mercaptopurine was tolerated in 71% (12/17) with hepatotoxicity and in 68%
      (13/19) with arthralgia/myalgia during azathioprine treatment. Previous abdominal
      surgery was more common in mercaptopurine intolerant patients [39/65 (60%) vs.
      27/70 (39%); P = 0.02] and thiopurine methyltransferase activity was higher in
      mercaptopurine tolerant patients than in mercaptopurine intolerant patients [13.2
      (11.4-15.3) vs. 11.8 (9.6-14.2) U/mL red blood cells; P = 0.04; n = 81].
      CONCLUSIONS: A trial of mercaptopurine should be considered in azathioprine
      intolerance, as half of the patients tolerate a switch to mercaptopurine.
      Patients with hepatotoxicity or arthralgia/myalgia during azathioprine treatment 
      might benefit more often than those with other types of adverse events.

TI  - Immune response to influenza vaccine in children with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 444-53
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2008.120 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) frequently receive
      immunosuppressive therapy. The immune response in these patients to vaccines has 
      not been well studied. We conducted a prospective, open label study to evaluate
      the serologic response to influenza vaccine in children with IBD. METHODS: Serum 
      was obtained from 146 children and young adults with IBD (96 Crohn's disease, 47 
      ulcerative colitis, and 3 indeterminate colitis) for baseline influenza titer,
      immediately followed by immunization with trivalent (A/Solomon Islands/3/2006
      (H1N1), A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2), and B/Malaysia/2506/2004 (B)) inactivated
      influenza vaccine. Patients returned for repeat titers 3-9 weeks later.
      Seroprotection against each influenza strain was defined as hemagglutination
      inhibition titer > or = 40. Patients were categorized as nonimmunosuppressed
      (NIS; aminosalicylates only, antibiotics only, or no therapy) or immunosuppressed
      (IS; any immunosuppressive agent). IS patients were further subcategorized as:
      (i) tacrolimus, (ii) tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitor, (3)
      immunomodulator, and (4) corticosteroids only. RESULTS: More patients were
      seroprotected against strains A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 than B strain (P<0.02),
      regardless of immunosuppression status. The proportion of seroprotected patients 
      and geometric mean titers at post-vaccination were similar between NIS and IS
      groups for all three strains. Subanalysis of patients not seroprotected at
      baseline showed that those receiving anti-TNF therapy were less likely to be
      seroprotected against strain B (14%) compared to patients in the NIS group (39%, 
      P=0.025). There were no serious vaccine-associated adverse events. CONCLUSIONS:
      Influenza vaccination produces a high prevalence of seroprotection in IBD
      patients, particularly against A strains. The vaccine is well tolerated. Routine 
      influenza vaccination in IBD patients is recommended, irrespective of whether
      patients receive immunosuppressive medications.

AB  - Probiotics are defined as live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate
      amounts, confer a health benefit on the host, including the gastrointestinal
      tract. While this beneficial effect was originally thought to stem from
      improvements in the intestinal microbial balance, there is now substantial
      evidence that probiotics can also provide benefits by modulating immune
      functions. In animal models, probiotic supplementation is able to provide
      protection from spontaneous and chemically induced colitis by downregulating
      inflammatory cytokines or inducing regulatory mechanisms in a strain-specific
      manner. In animal models of allergen sensitization and murine models of asthma
      and allergic rhinitis, orally administered probiotics can strain-dependently
      decrease allergen-specific IgE production, in part by modulating systemic
      cytokine production. Certain probiotics have been shown to decrease airway
      hyperresponsiveness and inflammation by inducing regulatory mechanisms. Promising
      results have been obtained with probiotics in the treatment of human inflammatory
      diseases of the intestine and in the prevention and treatment of atopic eczema in
      neonates and infants. However, the findings are too variable to allow firm
      conclusions as to the effectiveness of specific probiotics in these conditions.

PG  - 843-54
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2009.03944.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who are
      corticosteroid-dependent or -refractory are at higher risk of developing disease-
      and treatment-related complications. AIMS: To identify retrospectively clinical
      factors present at diagnosis that predict the occurrence of corticosteroid
      dependency and refractoriness in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)
      patients. METHODS: A total of 310 IBD patients (134 CD, 176 UC) were observed for
      2140 person years and their use of systemic corticosteroids was determined.
      Outcomes of corticosteroid dependency and refractoriness were recorded.
      Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the clinical
      factors associated with outcomes. RESULTS: Seventy-seven (57.5%) CD and 95
      (54.0%) UC patients had received corticosteroids during study period. In CD,
      thrombocytosis [Hazard ratio (HR):3.0] predicted, whereas colonic CD (HR:0.3)
      negatively predicted corticosteroid dependency. Stricturing phenotype (HR:4.5)
      predicted corticosteroid-refractory CD. For UC, thrombocytosis (HR:3.9) and
      extensive colitis (HR:1.7) predicted corticosteroid dependency. Presence of
      anaemia (HR:10.8) at diagnosis and initial requirement of total parenteral
      nutrition (TPN) (HR:18.8) predicted corticosteroid-refractory UC. The cumulative 
      risks of surgery were 17.8% and 5.4% for CD and UC patients respectively at 1
      year after starting corticosteroids. CONCLUSIONS: Thrombocytosis at diagnosis
      predicted corticosteroid-dependency in IBD. Stricturing phenotype of CD and the
      presence of anaemia in UC predicted subsequent course of corticosteroid
      refractoriness.

TI  - The role of the high-affinity IgE receptor, FcepsilonRI, in eosinophilic
      gastrointestinal diseases.

AB  - Primary eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases (EGIDs) are a heterogeneous group 
      of diseases including eosinophilic esophagitis, eosinophilic gastritis,
      eosinophilic gastroenteritis, eosinophilic enteritis, and eosinophilic colitis.
      The unifying hallmark and diagnostic marker of EGIDs is an eosinophil-rich
      inflammatory infiltrate of the GI mucosa, in the absence of known causes for
      eosinophilia. The etiology of EGIDs is not yet fully understood. The pathogenesis
      however seems to involve a complex interplay of genetic predisposition, exposure 
      to food- and environmental allergens and IgE-mediated activation of the immune
      system. Accumulating evidence relates EGIDs to the group of T-helper (Th) 2
      mediated immune disorders, like IgE-mediated allergy. In this article we discuss 
      a possible role of IgE-mediated immune-activation via the high affinity receptor 
      for IgE, FcepsilonRI, in the pathogenesis of primary EGIDs. Beyond its defined
      role in type I allergic reactions, we here hypothesize that activation of
      tetrameric FcepsilonRI on mast cells and basophils as well as trimeric
      FcepsilonRI on human eosinophils and antigen presenting cells in the
      gastrointestinal mucosa is critically involved in the pathology of EGIDs. We also
      discuss how IgE-independent triggering of FcepsilonRI could be a mechanisms
      responsible for activation of the immune system in patients with EGID.

PG  - 149-58, xii
LID - 10.1016/j.iac.2008.10.006 [doi]
AB  - Eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases (EGIDs) encompass a variety of disorders
      including eosinophilic esophagitis (EE), eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EG), and
      eosinophilic colitis. Although the pathogenesis of EGIDs is still poorly
      understood, dietary food antigens have been shown to cause EGIDs through several 
      short-term clinical studies. The relationship of EGIDs with food allergy points
      to a potential breach of oral tolerance in EGIDs and to a potentially important
      role played by lymphocytes in responding to the oral food antigens. This article 
      discusses the concept of oral tolerance, the available evidence for the role that
      lymphocytes play in the induction and pathogenesis of EGIDs, and the evidence for
      a potential breach in oral tolerance in EGIDs.

TI  - Cyclosporine treatment of steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis during pregnancy.
PG  - 1044-8
LID - 10.1002/ibd.20858 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cyclosporine is considered a safe and effective treatment of severe
      steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis (UC). However, few data are available
      concerning its safety profile in pregnant women. We report here the experience of
      5 GETAID centers. METHODS: In a retrospective study data on patients with severe 
      UC treated with cyclosporine during pregnancy were extracted from medical records
      of consecutive patients treated between 2001 and 2007. RESULTS: Eight patients
      (median age 30.5 years old) were identified. At the time of flare-up the median
      duration of pregnancy was 11.5 weeks of gestation (range 4-25). Seven patients
      had pancolitis. All patients had more than 3 commonly used clinical and
      biological severity criteria. Three patients had severe endoscopic lesions and 5 
      patients had not. All patients received intravenous corticosteroids for at least 
      7 days before introduction of cyclosporine. Two patients received azathioprine
      during treatment with cyclosporine. No severe infections or other complications
      due to treatment were observed. Treatment was effective in 7/8 patients. One
      patient received infliximab due to cyclosporine therapy failure with a good
      outcome. No colectomy was performed during pregnancy. Seven pregnancies were
      conducted to term, but 1 in utero death occurred due to maternal absence of
      S-protein. Two newborns were premature, including 1 case of hypotrophy. No
      malformations were observed. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, treatment with
      cyclosporine for steroid-refractory UC during pregnancy can be considered safe
      and effective.

TI  - Pain and inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 778-88
LID - 10.1002/ibd.20848 [doi]
AB  - Abdominal pain is a common symptom of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD: Crohn's
      disease, ulcerative colitis). Pain may arise from different mechanisms, which can
      include partial blockage and gut distention as well as severe intestinal
      inflammation. A majority of patients suffering from acute flares of IBD will
      experience pain, which will typically improve as disease activity decreases.
      However, a significant percentage of IBD patients continue experiencing symptoms 
      of pain despite resolving inflammation and achieving what appears to be clinical 
      remission. Current evidence suggests that sensory pathways sensitize during
      inflammation, leading to persistent changes in afferent neurons and central
      nervous system pain processing. Such persistent pain is not only a simple result 
      of sensory input. Pain processing and even the activation of sensory pathways is 
      modulated by arousal, emotion, and cognitive factors. Considering the high
      prevalence of iatrogenic as well as essential neuropsychiatric comorbidities
      including anxiety and depression in IBD patients, these central modulating
      factors may significantly contribute to the clinical manifestation of chronic
      pain. The improved understanding of peripheral and central pain mechanisms is
      leading to new treatment strategies that view pain as a biopsychosocial problem. 
      Thus, improving the underlying inflammation, decreasing the excitability of
      sensitized afferent pathways, and altering emotional and/or cognitive functions
      may be required to more effectively address the difficult and disabling disease
      manifestations.

TI  - Mathematical weighting of a clinimetric index (Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis

PG  - 738-44
LID - 10.1016/j.jclinepi.2008.09.008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to compare the judgmental and mathematical approaches in
      weighting the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI). METHODS: The
      PUCAI was previously weighted mathematically using multivariate regression
      modeling on 157 children with ulcerative colitis (UC). Independently, a Delphi
      group of 36 experts in pediatric UC judgmentally provided weights to the PUCAI's 
      items. The agreement between the tools was evaluated using the 95% limits of
      agreement method. Validity was assessed on a prospective cohort of 48 UC
      children, using three constructs: colonoscopic appearance, physician's global
      assessment, and the Mayo score. Responsiveness was compared on a longitudinal
      cohort of 75 children. RESULTS: The weights of the resulting PUCAI tools were
      quite similar, but the Delphi group retained the laboratory items, excluded by
      the mathematical modeling. This difference was reflected by the Bland and Altman 
      method. Both tools performed equally well in the validation and responsiveness
      cohorts. CONCLUSION: The judgmentally weighted PUCAI had good validity and
      responsiveness. The mathematical weighting, however, performed just as well
      without the laboratory items, resulting in a more feasible index. Therefore, the 
      mathematical modeling has proven to be superior in weighting the PUCAI.

TI  - Folate concentrations in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed inflammatory
      bowel disease.
PG  - 545-50
LID - 10.3945/ajcn.2008.26576 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Folate is postulated to protect against cell injury and long-term
      risk of cancer. Folate deficiency has been shown to be associated with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, folate concentrations are poorly
      delineated in children with IBD. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare folate
      concentrations between children with newly diagnosed IBD and healthy controls.
      DESIGN: Red blood cell folate (RBCF) and whole-blood folate (WBF) concentrations 
      were measured in 78 children (mean age: 12.8 +/- 2.7 y): 22 patients with newly
      diagnosed untreated Crohn disease, 11 patients with ulcerative colitis, 4
      patients with indeterminate colitis, and 41 controls. Vitamin supplementation and
      dietary intakes determined by food-frequency questionnaire were recorded for 20
      IBD patients and 28 controls. RESULTS: RBCF concentrations were 19.4% lower in
      controls (587.0 +/- 148.6 ng/mL) than in patients (728.7 +/- 185.8 ng/mL; P =
      0.0004), and WBF concentrations were 11.1% lower in controls (218.2 +/- 49.7
      ng/mL) than in patients (245.3 +/- 59.1 ng/mL; P = 0.031). Total folate intake
      was 18.8% higher in controls (444.7 +/- 266.7 microg/d) than in IBD patients
      (361.1 +/- 230.6 microg/d), but this difference was not statistically significant
      (P = 0.264). Folate intakes were below the Recommended Dietary Allowance (200-400
      microg/d), adjusted for age and sex, in 35.4% of study subjects. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      contrast with previous evidence of folate deficiency in adult IBD patients, our
      data indicate higher folate concentrations in children with newly diagnosed
      untreated IBD than in controls. This finding was unexpected, especially in light 
      of the higher dietary folate intakes and hematocrit values in children without
      IBD. The influence of IBD therapy on folate metabolism and the long-term clinical
      implications of high RBCF and WBF concentrations at the time of IBD diagnosis
      should be explored further.

      colorectal cancer (CRC). Risk factors for the development of CRC in the setting
      of IBD include disease duration, anatomic extent of disease, age at time of
      diagnosis, severity of inflammation, family history of colon cancer, and
      concomitant primary sclerosing cholangitis. The current surveillance strategy of 
      surveillance colonoscopy with multiple random biopsies most likely reduces
      morbidity and mortality associated with IBD-related CRC. Unfortunately,
      surveillance colonoscopy also has severe limitations including high cost,
      sampling error at time of biopsy, and interobserver disagreement in
      histologically grading dysplasia. Furthermore, once dysplasia is detected there
      is disagreement about its management. Advances in endoscopic imaging techniques
      are already underway, and may potentially aid in dysplasia detection and improve 
      overall surveillance outcomes. Management of dysplasia depends predominantly on
      the degree and focality of dysplasia, with the mainstay of management involving
      either proctocolectomy or continued colonoscopic surveillance. Lastly, continued 
      research into additional chemopreventive agents may increase our arsenal in
      attempting to reduce the incidence of IBD-associated CRC.

TI  - Fecal calprotectin complements routine laboratory investigations in diagnosing
      childhood inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 756-9
LID - 10.1002/ibd.20820 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to study fecal calprotectin in Scottish children with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and compare its diagnostic accuracy with blood
      parameters. METHODS: Stool samples from 48 Scottish children (29 males, 19
      females) had calprotectin measured at IBD diagnosis. The median age at diagnosis 
      was 11.2 years (interquartile range [IQR] 8.7-13.0 years). There were 33 patients
      with Crohn's disease, 5 with ulcerative colitis, and 10 with IBD type
      unspecified. IBD was diagnosed by standard criteria. Calprotectin was measured
      using a commercially available kit (PhiCal Test) and 47/48 patients had
      comparative blood results available at diagnosis. RESULTS: The fecal calprotectin
      concentrations were raised in 96% (46/48) of patients studied. The median
      calprotectin value was 750 microg/g (IQR 235.8-1251 microug/g). In comparison
      with standard blood tests, 32/45 (71.1%) had abnormal erythrocyte sedimentation
      rate, 19/38 (50.0%) had abnormal C-reactive protein, 29/46 (63.0%) had raised
      platelets, 12/45 (26.7%) had hypoalbuminemia, and 38/46 (82.6%) had abnormal
      hemoglobin. We identified 7/47 (14.9%) patients with raised calprotectin at
      diagnosis who did not have any abnormalities detected in the blood tests
      performed. All 48 patients (100%) had at least 1 abnormal blood test and/or
      raised calprotectin at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Calprotectin is significantly more
      likely to be raised than any commonly employed blood tests at IBD diagnosis. When
      used in combination with these bloods tests an abnormality was demonstrated in 1 
      or both tests in all patients at diagnosis in this study. Fecal calprotectin
      measurement is a significant advance when used contemporaneously and in addition 
      to a routine panel of blood tests in the diagnosis of pediatric IBD.

TI  - Probiotic preparation VSL#3 induces remission in children with mild to moderate
      acute ulcerative colitis: a pilot study.
PG  - 760-8
LID - 10.1002/ibd.20816 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      that has periods of exacerbated symptoms and periods that are symptom-free. The
      treatment of active UC with probiotic bacteria could possibly induce remission.
      We evaluated the clinical efficacy and safety profile of probiotic preparation
      VSL#3 in the treatment of mild to moderate acute UC in the pediatric population. 
      METHODS: Eighteen eligible patients between the ages of 3-17 with mild to
      moderate acute UC received open-label VSL#3 daily in 2 divided doses for 8 weeks.
      The disease activity pre- and post-VSL#3 therapy was assessed by the simple
      clinical colitis activity index (SCCAI); Mayo ulcerative colitis endoscopic
      score; inflammatory markers: erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive 
      protein (CRP); serum cytokine profiling; and rectal tissue microbial profiling
      done at baseline and at week 8. RESULTS: Thirteen patients completed 8 weeks of
      VSL#3 treatment and 5 patients were withdrawn due to lack of improvement.
      Remission (defined as SCCAI <or=3) was achieved in 56% of children (n = 10);
      response (decrease in SCCAI >or=2, but final score <or=5) in 6% (n = 1); and no
      change or worsening in 39% (n = 7). Post-VSL#3 treatments demonstrated a
      bacterial taxonomy change in rectal biopsy. The VSL#3 was well tolerated in
      clinical trials and no biochemical and clinical adverse effects attributed to
      VSL#3 were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of pediatric patients diagnosed
      with mild to moderate UC with VSL#3 resulted in a remission rate of 56% and a
      combined remission/response rate of 61%.

TI  - The ErbB4 growth factor receptor is required for colon epithelial cell survival
      in the presence of TNF.
PG  - 217-26
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2008.09.023 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The ErbB4 receptor tyrosine kinase regulates cell growth,
      survival, and differentiation in several tissues, but its role in the
      gastrointestinal tract has not been reported. We tested the hypothesis that ErbB4
      promotes intestinal cell survival and restitution following injury or
      inflammation. METHODS: ErbB4 expression in human inflammatory bowel disease was
      determined by immunohistochemistry. Mice were subjected to dextran sulfate sodium
      (DSS, 3%) colitis or injected with tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and ErbB4
      expression was quantified by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Cultured
      young adult mouse colon (YAMC) cells were exposed to TNF, and ErbB4 messenger
      RNA, protein, and phosphorylation levels were measured. Cells transfected with
      ErbB4 small interfering RNA (siRNA), or over expressing ErbB4, were subjected to 
      wound healing and apoptosis assays. RESULTS: ErbB4 levels increased in Crohn's
      colitis and the colon epithelium of mice with DSS colitis or injected with TNF.
      In YAMC cells, TNF induced ErbB4 messenger RNA, protein, and phosphorylation;
      nuclear factor kappaB activation also stimulated ErbB4 accumulation. ErbB4 siRNA 
      sensitized cells to TNF-stimulated apoptosis, while over expression blocked
      apoptosis induced by TNF plus cycloheximide. Additionally, ErbB4 siRNA decreased 
      YAMC cell wound healing. ErbB4 knockdown attenuated, while over expression
      elevated, phosphorylation of Akt in response to TNF. Inhibition of the
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling cascade reversed the ability of ErbB4
      over expression to protect from cytokine-induced apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: ErbB4
      expression and signaling are key elements for TNF responses in vivo and in cell
      culture, protecting intestinal epithelial cells from apoptosis in the
      inflammatory environment, possibly through Akt activation.

TI  - Pouchitis, similar to active ulcerative colitis, is associated with impaired
      butyrate oxidation by intestinal mucosa.
PG  - 335-40
LID - 10.1002/ibd.20768 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Healthy colonic mucosa uses butyrate as the major energy source. In
      ulcerative colitis (UC) butyrate oxidation has been shown to be disturbed, but it
      remains unclear whether this is a primary defect. The aim of this study was to
      measure mucosal butyrate oxidation in UC (involved and noninvolved colon) and in 
      pouchitis and to study the relationship with endoscopic as well as histological
      disease activity. METHODS: Butyrate oxidation was measured in 73 UC patients, 22 
      pouchitis patients, and 112 controls (95 colon, 17 ileum) by incubating biopsies 
      with 1 mM 14C-labeled Na-butyrate and measuring the released 14CO2. RESULTS:
      Compared with that in normal colon, butyrate oxidation was significantly impaired
      in endoscopically active but not in quiescent disease or uninvolved colon
      segments. The severity of the metabolic defect was related to histological
      disease activity and decreased epithelial cell height. In active pouchitis,
      butyrate oxidation was significantly decreased compared with that in normal ileum
      and excluded pouches without inflammation. The histological pouchitis score
      correlated significantly with butyrate oxidation. CONCLUSIONS: Active UC and
      pouchitis show the same inflammation-related metabolic defect. Our data suggest
      that the defect is a consequence of inflammation and that pouchitis is
      metabolically similar to active UC.

TI  - Circulating adipokines and the protective effects of hyperinsulinemia in
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 172-81
LID - 10.1016/j.nut.2008.07.020 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Adipokines are fat-derived hormones and cytokines with
      immune-modulating and metabolic properties. Most of them are associated with
      insulin resistance. The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate
      circulating levels of adipokines and glucose homeostasis in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and to evaluate possible associations with the
      course and characteristics of the disease. METHODS: Serum leptin, resistin,
      visfatin, retinol-binding protein-4, adiponectin, glucose, insulin, and
      inflammatory parameters were analyzed in 93 patients with inactive IBD (49 with
      Crohn's disease [CD], 44 with ulcerative colitis [UC]), 35 patients with active
      IBD (18 with CD, 17 with UC), and 37 age- and body mass index-matched healthy
      controls. Ninety-two patients were followed for 6 mo. RESULTS: Leptin was similar
      in patients with IBD and controls, whereas resistin and visfatin were increased
      in patients with active disease but not in those in remission. In active and
      inactive disease, adiponectin was decreased (P < 0.001) and retinol-binding
      protein-4 was increased (P < 0.001) compared with controls. About 60% of patients
      with IBD showed increased levels of insulin, whereas serum glucose remained
      normal, resulting in increased homeostasis model assessment values in most
      patients. Hyperinsulinemia was associated with the decrease in adiponectin (r =
      -0.572, P < 0.001) and proved to be an independent protective factor for 6-mo
      maintenance of remission (P = 0.016). CONCLUSION: IBD led to largely similar
      alterations in circulating adipokines and hyperinsulinemia in patients with CD
      and those with UC. The unexpected protective effect of hyperinsulinemia on
      relapse rate denotes the role of the metabolic-inflammatory response as a
      modulator in IBD.

TI  - High prevalence of vitamin K and D deficiency and decreased BMD in inflammatory
      bowel disease.
PG  - 935-42
LID - 10.1007/s00198-008-0764-2 [doi]
AB  - SUMMARY: Vitamin K and D deficiency and decreased bone mineral density (BMD) were
      highly prevalent in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially
      Crohn's disease (CD). Dietary intakes of these vitamins, however, were above the 
      Japanese adequate intakes in IBD patients, suggesting that malabsorption is the
      basis for hypovitaminosis K and D and decreased BMD. INTRODUCTION: We have
      studied the possible involvement of vitamin K and D deficiency in the
      pathogenesis of decreased BMD in IBD. METHODS: Seventy patients with IBD were
      evaluated for their BMD; plasma levels of vitamin K; phylloquinone (PK),
      menaquinone-7 (MK-7), and 25OH-D; serum PTH, protein induced by vitamin K absence
      (PIVKA-II), and undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) levels; and their food
      intake. RESULTS: Compared with ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, CD patients had 
      significantly lower plasma vitamin K and 25OH-D concentrations; significantly
      higher serum levels of PTH, PIVKA-II, and ucOC; and significantly lower BMD
      scores at almost all measurement sites. More IBD patients were vitamin K
      deficient in bone than in liver. Multiple regression analyses revealed that low
      plasma concentrations of vitamin K and 25OH-D were independent risk factors for
      low BMD and that they were associated with the patients' fat intake, but not with
      their intake of these vitamins. CONCLUSION: IBD patients have high prevalence of 
      decreased BMD and vitamin K and D deficiency probably caused by malabsorption of 
      these vitamins.

TI  - The 17-year single-center experience with the use of azathioprine to maintain
      remission in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 362-5
LID - 10.1016/j.biopha.2008.06.029 [doi]
AB  - Despite the accumulation of positive data, the role of azathioprine (AZA) in the 
      maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis is still controversial. We looked 
      at the follow-up of the ulcerative colitis patients who, after responding to
      either steroids or cyclosporin (CsA), received AZA at our referral center for
      over a decade. The 39 patients (29 m/10f) were treated between 1991 and 2007.
      Twenty-five of them had responded to CsA, the remaining 14 to corticosteroids.
      AZA was usually overlapped with either of the two agents at the initial dose of
      2mg/kg/day. The definitions of remission, relapse, and AZA toxicity followed
      commonly agreed criteria. The median duration of the AZA treatment was 14 months 
      (<1-201). Fifty-two percent and 14%, respectively, of the CsA and the steroid
      responders needed surgery (overall rate=38%). The figures were 32 and 15 at the
      first year. The majority of the patients had 1-2 relapses often in connection
      with withdrawal of AZA; only 3 of these relapsers needed hospitalization. AZA
      caused toxicity in 16/39 (41%) patients, requiring withdrawal in 23% of the
      cases; leukopenia (17%) and hepatitis/cholestasis (10%) ranked first and second
      for frequency. All of the patients in whom AZA was stopped (or reduced) relapsed.
      In conclusion, the 1-year colectomy rates compare favorably with the figures
      reported by the literature. By contrast, the toxicity rates were higher than
      expected. Failure to genotype or to use escalating AZA doses can only be
      hypothesized as causes.

PG  - 627-33
LID - 10.1007/s10620-008-0398-4 [doi]
AB  - In order to increase dietary folic acid intake and to improve nutritional status 
      regarding folate by controlling homocysteine concentrations, ten patients with
      inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease in the colon and ulcerative colitis)
      received individualized nutritional guidance and were followed up as outpatients 
      for 2 months. The following procedures were performed at the beginning of the
      study (T0), after 1 month (T1) and at the end of the study (T2): collection of
      anthropometric data (weight and height), dietary data (24 h diet recall), and
      blood under fasting condition for the determination of serum folic acid,
      homocysteine, C-reactive protein, and vitamin B12. Plasma folic acid deficiency
      was not detected but hyperhomocysteinemia was present in six individuals and
      C-reactive protein (CRP) was increased (>0.5 mg/dl) in seven patients. After the 
      patients were instructed there was a significant increase in vitamin B6 intake
      (about 35%) and in folate intake (49.6%). Mean plasma levels of folic acid,
      homocysteine, and vitamin B12 did not change, but there was a significant
      decrease of CRP at T1, 0.36 mg dl(-1) on average (P = 0.01), which was maintained
      at T2. We conclude that the increased folate intake reported by this group of
      patients was not reflected in improved serum concentrations of folic acid and
      homocysteine. However, the guidelines for the patients probably induced them to
      choose a more adequate diet, providing nutrients that help control the
      inflammatory process.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is often associated with malnutrition. The aim
      of this study was to compare the body composition of outpatients with IBD during 
      remission and active phase. In order to evaluate disease activity we used Crohn's
      Disease Activity Index for Crohn's disease (CD) patients and Lichtiger's Index
      for ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. All patients underwent the analysis of BMI,
      arm muscle area (AMA) and triceps plus subscapula skinfold thickness (TST+SST) to
      identify total, muscle and fat mass, respectively. In total 102 patients were
      evaluated (CD, n 50; UC, n 52) and the majority was young women. Malnutrition
      according to BMI was found in 14.0 % of patients with CD and 5.7 % of UC
      patients. Muscle mass depletion was detected in more than half of the CD and UC
      patients. The BMI, TST+SST and AMA values were lower in the active phase only in 
      CD patients (P < 0.05). Fat mass depletion was associated with active phase in
      both CD and UC patients. Body composition parameters obtained using BMI, TST+SST 
      and AMA were not correlated with the presence of fistula in CD patients (P>0.05).
      In conclusion, patients without signs of malnutrition had fat mass depletion
      especially in the active phase and muscle mass depletion occurred both in CD and 
      UC patients.

TI  - Development of extraintestinal manifestations in pediatric patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 63-8
LID - 10.1002/ibd.20604 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) in pediatric patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are poorly characterized. We examined the
      prevalence of EIMs at diagnosis, subsequent incidence, and risk factors for EIMs.
      METHODS: Data for 1649 patients from the PediIBD Consortium Registry, diagnosed
      with IBD before 18 years of age (1007 [61%] with Crohn's disease, 471 [29%] with 
      ulcerative colitis, and 171 [10%] with indeterminate colitis), were analyzed
      using logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier, log rank tests, and Cox models. RESULTS:
      EIMs were reported prior to IBD diagnosis in 97 of 1649 patients (6%). Older
      children at diagnosis had higher rates compared with younger children, and
      arthritis (26%) and aphthous stomatitis (21%) were most common. Among the 1552
      patients without EIM at diagnosis, 290 developed at least 1 EIM. Kaplan-Meier
      estimates of cumulative incidence were 9% at 1 year, 19% at 5 years, and 29% at
      15 years after diagnosis. Incidence did not differ by IBD type (P = 0.20), age at
      diagnosis (P = 0.22), or race/ethnicity (P = 0.24). Arthritis (17%) and
      osteopenia/osteoporosis (15%) were the most common EIMs after IBD diagnosis.
      CONCLUSIONS: In our large cohort of pediatric IBD patients, 6% had at least 1 EIM
      before diagnosis of IBD. At least 1 EIM will develop in 29% within 15 years of
      diagnosis. The incidence of EIMs both before and after diagnosis of IBD differs
      by type of EIM and may be slightly higher in girls, but is independent of the
      type of IBD, age at diagnosis, and race/ethnicity.

TI  - Body mass and composition affect bone density in recently diagnosed inflammatory 
      bowel disease: the Manitoba IBD Cohort Study.
PG  - 39-46
LID - 10.1002/ibd.20541 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This prospective study was undertaken to clarify the role of body
      mass and composition as a determinant of bone mineral density (BMD) in recently
      diagnosed inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: A nested subgroup of 101
      adult subjects of the population-based Manitoba IBD Cohort Study were enrolled.
      Baseline BMD and body composition were measured and repeated 2.3 +/- 0.3 years
      later. RESULTS: Greater weight, height, and body mass measurements were
      positively correlated with bone density at all sites (P < 0.01). Although both
      fat tissue and lean tissue showed positive relationships with BMD, lean tissue
      showed a much stronger correlation than fat tissue, especially for the total hip 
      (r = 0.66, P < 0.001 versus r = 0.23, P < 0.05) and total body measurements (r = 
      0.59, P < 0.001 versus r = 0.04, P NS). Increase (or decrease) in hip bone
      density was strongly associated with an increase (or decrease) in all body mass
      variables (r = 0.49-0.54, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Measures of body mass are
      important determinants of baseline BMD in recently diagnosed IBD patients.
      Furthermore, change in body mass is correlated with change in BMD, especially at

      particularly toward lean tissue mass, may play an important role in preventing
      IBD-related bone disease.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is uncommon in children younger than 2 years of 
      age. The criteria for differentiating IBD from other diseases with similar
      clinical presentation is unclear. We describe 16 patients who, between 1984 and
      2004, received a histological diagnosis of IBD during the first two years of
      life. Six patients presented with histological Crohn's disease, eight with
      ulcerative colitis and two with indeterminate colitis. The median age at
      diagnosis was 125 days (range 1 day to 18 months) and the medium follow up was 89
      months (range 65 days to 20 years). The disease appeared to be very severe: four 
      children (25%) underwent total parenteral nutrition (TPN), two received colectomy
      (12.5%) and three patients died. Many of the patients required an aggressive,
      multidrug, immunosuppressive approach (azathioprine [AZA], Infliximab,
      thalidomide, cyclosporine A). One child presented with a hypogammaglobulinaemia
      without any specific immunodeficiency, while in the other patients,
      Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) (4 cases) and chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) 
      (2 cases) were identified. In 6/16 cases, allergic colitis was first considered; 
      these cases initially underwent cow's milk protein-free diet as the only therapy 
      before IBD was finally diagnosed. In conclusion, early IBD has a severe prognosis
      and often needs an aggressive therapeutic approach. Furthermore, an improper
      diagnosis of allergic colitis might cause an important diagnostic delay. Some
      severe immunodeficiencies, such as WAS and CGD, may represent a problem in terms 
      of differential diagnosis and might be wrongly diagnosed as very early onset IBD.
