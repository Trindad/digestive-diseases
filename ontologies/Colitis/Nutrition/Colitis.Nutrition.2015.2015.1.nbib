TI  - The Influence of Ghrelin on the Development of Dextran Sodium Sulfate-Induced
      Colitis in Rats.

LID - 10.1155/2015/718314 [doi]
AB  - Ghrelin has protective and therapeutic effects in the gut. The aim of present
      studies was to investigate the effect of treatment with ghrelin on the
      development of colitis evoked by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Methods. Studies
      have been performed on rats. Colitis was induced by adding 5% DSS to the drinking
      water for 5 days. During this period animals were treated intraperitoneally twice
      a day with saline or ghrelin given at the dose of 8 nmol/kg/dose. On the sixth
      day, animals were anesthetized and the severity of colitis was assessed. Results.
      Treatment with ghrelin during administration of DSS reduced the development of
      colitis. Morphological features of colonic mucosa exhibited a reduction in the
      area and deep of mucosal damage. Ghrelin reversed the colitis-induced decrease in
      blood flow, DNA synthesis, and superoxide dismutase activity in colonic mucosa.
      These effects were accompanied by a decrease in the colitis-evoked increase in
      mucosal concentration of interleukin-1beta and malondialdehyde. Treatment with
      ghrelin reversed the DSS-induced reduction in body weight gain. Conclusions.
      Administration of ghrelin exhibits the preventive effect against the development 
      of DSS-induced colitis. This effect seems to be related to ghrelin's
      anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties.

PG  - 695-9
LID - 10.5604/12321966.1185778 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The most prevalent inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) include
      ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Immune processes play a vital
      role in the etiopathogenesis of these conditions, involving both cellular and
      humoral response mechanisms. The aim of this study was to quantify CD40- and
      CD80-positive cells in the biopsy specimens of large intestinal mucosa from
      children with IBD. MATERIALS AND METHOD: The study comprised 38 children aged
      between 3-17 years (mean 11.5+/-3.7 years) - 20 boys (52.6 %) and 18 girls
      (47.4%). Eighteen patients were diagnosed with UC on the basis of clinical
      manifestation, endoscopic and histopathological findings. Mean age of this
      subgroup was 11.55+/-4.07 years. A group of 10 children (mean age 12.30+/-2.83)
      diagnosed with CD was also included. The control group comprised 10 IBD-free
      children (mean age 10.28+/-4.07 years). The surface expressions of CD40 and CD80 
      were analyzed in large intestine mucosa biopsy specimens, fixed in formaldehyde, 
      embedded in paraffin, and cut with a microtome into 4 microm slices. RESULTS: The
      number of CD40- and CD80-positive cells in the large intestinal mucosa of
      children with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis was significantly higher
      than in the controls. The highest number of CD40+ and CD80+ cells was observed in
      the caecal mucosal membrane of Crohn's disease patients and in the rectal mucosa 
      of individuals with ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSION: IBD is characterized by
      elevated, segment-specific, expression of CD40 and CD80.

      Disease in Slovenia: A Nationwide Study.
PG  - 921730
LID - 10.1155/2015/921730 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aims of the study were to determine the incidence rate of
      pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD) and its trends for the period of
      2002-2010 and to assess the geographical distribution of PIBD in Slovenia.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records of patients (0-18 years) with newly
      diagnosed IBD during the study period were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: The
      mean incidence rate for IBD in 2002-2010 was 7.6 per 100,000 children and
      adolescents per year, 4.5 for Crohn's disease (CD), 2.9 for ulcerative colitis
      (UC), and 0.2 for IBD-unclassified, respectively. The incidence rate increased
      from 5.8 per 100,000 per year in 2002-2004 to 8.6 in 2005-2007 and remained
      stable afterwards. Statistically significant difference in the incidence rate
      between the Northeastern and Southwestern parts of the country was observed (p = 
      0.025). CONCLUSION: This nationwide study demonstrates that Slovenia is among the
      European countries with the highest PIBD incidence. During the study period a
      substantial rise of PIBD incidence was observed during the first half of the
      study and it seems to have stabilized in the second half. The significant
      difference in PIBD incidence between Northeastern and Southwestern parts of the
      country merits further exploration of the possible environmental factors.

TI  - TGF-beta in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: A Tale of the Janus-Like Cytokine.
PG  - 335-47
AB  - Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a pleiotropic cytokine that
      controls an immense number of cellular responses and plays a prominent role in
      maintaining homeostasis of most human organs. In the intestine, the TGF-beta is
      involved in mucosal defense, immune tolerance, inhibition of acute inflammation, 
      promoting the wound-healing process, and suppressing tumor initiation. However,
      TGF-beta exhibits Janus-like features under certain physiologic conditions and
      chronic inflammation (e.g., inflammatory bowel diseases [IBDs]). Excessive
      TGF-beta in IBDs favors chronic inflammation, incurs pathologic remolding, and
      facilitates the progression of colitis-associated inflammation (CAC). Considering
      the increasingly crucial roles of TGF-Beta in the development of IBDs, we
      overview its pathways and multifaceted effects at the steady-state and IBD
      conditions of the gut, respectively. In addition, we present potential
      therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring normal TGF-beta signaling in IBDs.

TI  - Fecal pyruvate kinase is not suitable for discrimination between inflammatory
      bowel disease exacerbation and acute gastroenteritis.
PG  - 167-73
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) diarrhea can be caused by
      exacerbation and/or infectious agents. Fecal calprotectin (FC) is a
      well-established biomarker of intestinal inflammation in IBD. However, its
      usefulness in depiction of IBD exacerbation from infectious diarrhea is limited. 
      The value of fecal pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type 2 (M2-PK) in this application
      remains unknown. AIM: To compare the performance of M2-PK and FC in
      discriminating between diarrhea caused by IBD and infectious agents. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: One hundred three patients were enrolled for the study, including 32
      with ulcerative colitis (UC), 21 with Crohn's disease (CD), 29 with acute
      diarrhea caused by rotavirus (AD-RV), and 21 with acute diarrhea caused by
      Salmonella enteritidis (AD-SE). M2-PK and FC were measured using ELISA. Areas
      under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs), sensitivities and
      specificities for both tests in distinguishing between patient subgroups with
      moderate to severe UC and CD from AD-RV and AD-SE were calculated. RESULTS:
      Differences in AUCs between M2-PK and FC for distinguishing UC [CD] from AD-RV
      were -0.06 (p < 0.028) [-0.10 (p < 0.0018)] and for differentiating UC [CD] from 
      AD-SE were 0.03 (NS) [-0.19(p < 0.0011)].M2-PK sensitivities and specificities in
      distinguishing UC [CD] from AD-RV were 75.0%[71.4%] and 89.7% [89.7%] and for
      differentiation of UC [CD] from AD-SE were 56.3% [71.4%] and 95.2[57.1%].
      CONCLUSIONS: The performance of M2-PK in distinguishing between children with
      moderate-to-severe IBD and patients with infectious gastroenteritis was inferior 
      to FC. Neither test had sensitivity ands pecificity sufficient for everyday
      clinical application.

PG  - 541-5
LID - 10.18388/abp.2015_982 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the usefulness of fecal lactoferrin in the
      diagnosis and monitoring of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children. The
      study included 52 children with IBD (24 with Crohn's disease and 28 with
      ulcerative colitis) aged between 0.92 and 18 years, and 41 IBD-free controls of
      similar age. Fecal concentration of lactoferrin was determined with a
      quantitative immunoenzymatic test. Fecal concentration of lactoferrin in children
      with IBD was significantly higher than in the controls. The cut-off value of
      fecal lactoferrin concentration optimally distinguishing between the children
      with IBD and the controls was identified as 13 mug/g. The sensitivity and
      specificity of this cut-off value equaled 80.7% and 92.7%, respectively, and its 
      positive and negative prognostic values were 96.8% and 63.3%, respectively.
      Patients diagnosed with moderate Crohn's disease had significantly higher fecal
      concentrations of lactoferrin than children with the mild or inactive disease.
      Similarly, children with moderate ulcerative colitis showed significantly higher 
      fecal concentrations of lactoferrin than individuals with the mild condition. No 
      significant relationship was found between the fecal concentration of lactoferrin
      and the severity of endoscopic lesions. Patients with IBD and a positive result
      of fecal occult blood test were characterized by significantly higher
      concentrations of lactoferrin than the individuals with IBD and a negative result
      of this test. In conclusion, fecal concentration of lactoferrin seems to be a
      useful parameter for diagnosis and monitoring of IBD in children.

TI  - PancreApp: An Innovative Approach to Computational Individualization of
      Nutritional Therapy in Chronic Gastrointestinal Disorders.
PG  - 325-8
AB  - Medical nutrition therapy has a pivotal role in the management of chronic
      gastrointestinal disorders, like chronic pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel
      diseases (Lesniowski-Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) or irritable bowel
      syndrome. The aim of this study is to develop, deploy and evaluate an interactive
      application for Windows and Android operating systems, which could serve as a
      digital diet diary and as an analysis and a prediction tool both for the patient 
      and the doctor. The software is gathering details about patients' diet and
      associated fettle in order to estimate fettle change after future meals,
      specifically for an individual patient. In this paper we have described the
      process of idea development and application design, feasibility assessment using 
      a phone survey, a preliminary evaluation on 6 healthy individuals and early
      results of a clinical trial, which is still an ongoing study. Results suggest
      that applied approximative approach (Shepard's method of 6-dimensional metric
      interpolation) has a potential to predict the fettle accurately; as shown in
      leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV).

AB  - The gastrointestinal (GI) tract provides an intriguing organ for considering the 
      eosinophil's role in health and disease. The normal GI tract, except for the
      esophagus, is populated by eosinophils that are present throughout the mucosa,
      raising the possibility that eosinophils participate in innate mechanisms of
      defense. However, data from clinical studies associates increased numbers of
      eosinophils with inflammatory GI diseases, prompting concerns that eosinophils
      may have a deleterious effect on the gut. We present clinical features of 4
      disease processes that have been associated with eosinophilia and suggest areas
      requiring investigation as to their clinical significance and scientific
      relevance.

AB  - Prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins (PHDs) control cellular adaptation to hypoxia.
      PHDs are found involved in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, the exact
      role of PHD3, a member of the PHD family, in IBD remains unknown. We show here
      that PHD3 plays a critical role in maintaining intestinal epithelial barrier
      function. We found that genetic ablation of Phd3 in intestinal epithelial cells
      led to spontaneous colitis in mice. Deletion of PHD3 decreases the level of tight
      junction protein occludin, leading to a failure of intestinal epithelial barrier 
      function. Further studies indicate that PHD3 stabilizes occludin by preventing
      the interaction between the E3 ligase Itch and occludin, in a
      hydroxylase-independent manner. Examination of biopsy of human ulcerative colitis
      patients indicates that PHD3 is decreased with disease severity, indicating that 
      PHD3 down-regulation is associated with progression of this disease. We show that
      PHD3 protects intestinal epithelial barrier function and reveal a
      hydroxylase-independent function of PHD3 in stabilizing occludin. These findings 
      may help open avenues for developing a therapeutic strategy for IBD.

TI  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli infection has donor-dependent effect on human

PG  - 9097-110

AB  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) are major food-borne pathogens
      responsible for serious infections ranging from mild diarrhea to hemorrhagic
      colitis and life-threatening complications. Shiga toxins (Stxs) are the main
      virulence factor of EHEC. The antagonistic effect of a prophylactic treatment
      with the probiotic strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae against EHEC O157:H7 was
      investigated using complementary in vitro human colonic model and in vivo murine 
      ileal loop assays. In vitro, the probiotic treatment had no effect on O157:H7
      survival but favorably influenced gut microbiota activity through modulation of
      short-chain fatty acid production, increasing acetate production and decreasing
      that of butyrate. Both pathogen and probiotic strains had individual-dependent
      effects on human gut microbiota. For the first time, stx expression was followed 
      in human colonic environment: at 9 and 12 h post EHEC infection, probiotic
      treatment significantly decreased stx mRNA levels. Besides, in murine ileal
      loops, the probiotic yeast specifically exerted a trophic effect on intestinal
      mucosa and inhibited O157:H7 interactions with Peyer's patches and subsequent
      hemorrhagic lesions. Taken together, the results suggest that S. cerevisiae may
      be useful in the fight against EHEC infection and that host associated factors
      such as microbiota could influence clinical evolution of EHEC infection and the
      effectiveness of probiotics.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which primarily includes Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis, involves chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. 
      The mechanisms of IBD pathogenesis are not well understood at this time, but
      likely involve an interaction between genetic, gut microbial, immune, and
      environmental factors. Emerging epidemiologic studies have suggested a
      relationship between specific dietary nutrients as an environmental factor and
      IBD risk. Clinical trials have also shown oral diets to have variable efficacy in
      affecting clinical outcomes for IBD. This review discusses the key studies that
      evaluated the use of various oral diets as well as nutrition support in the
      management of IBD.

TI  - Macrophage and dendritic cell subsets in IBD: ALDH+ cells are reduced in colon
      tissue of patients with ulcerative colitis regardless of inflammation.
PG  - 171-82
LID - 10.1038/mi.2015.48 [doi]
AB  - Disruption of the homeostatic balance of intestinal dendritic cells (DCs) and
      macrophages (MQs) may contribute to inflammatory bowel disease. We characterized 
      DC and MQ populations, including their ability to produce retinoic acid, in
      clinical material encompassing Crohn's ileitis, Crohn's colitis and ulcerative
      colitis (UC) as well as mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) draining these sites.
      Increased CD14(+)DR(int) MQs characterized inflamed intestinal mucosa while total
      CD141(+) or CD1c(+) DCs numbers were unchanged. However, CD103(+) DCs, including 
      CD141(+)CD103(+) and CD1c(+)CD103(+) DCs, were reduced in inflamed intestine. In 
      MLNs, two CD14(-) DC populations were identified: CD11c(int)HLADR(hi) and
      CD11c(hi)HLADR(int) cells. A marked increase of CD11c(hi)HLADR(int) DC,
      particularly DR(int)CD1c(+) DCs, characterized MLNs draining inflamed intestine. 
      The fraction of DC and MQ populations expressing aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)
      activity, reflecting retinoic acid synthesis, in UC colon, both in active disease
      and remission, were reduced compared to controls and inflamed Crohn's colon. In
      contrast, no difference in the frequency of ALDH(+) cells among blood precursors 
      was detected between UC patients and non-inflamed controls. This suggests that
      ALDH activity in myeloid cells in the colon of UC patients, regardless of whether
      the disease is active or in remission, is influenced by the intestinal
      environment.

TI  - The severity of inflammation at onset of ulcerative colitis is not associated
      with IBS-like symptoms during clinical remission.
PG  - 776-83
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv107 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Symptoms compatible with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are 
      common in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) in clinical remission. It has
      been suggested that these symptoms might arise due to post-inflammatory changes
      comparable with post-infectious IBS. The aim was to study factors at new onset of
      UC that predict development of IBS-like symptoms during clinical remission.
      METHODS: In total, 98 patients with new onset of UC were followed prospectively
      for 3 years with yearly follow-up visits. Data from the first visit at the onset 
      of UC were compared between a group of patients who fulfilled the criteria for
      IBS while in remission (UCR+IBS) during follow-up and a group who did not
      (UCR-IBS). RESULTS: Among the UC patients, 87 met the criteria for clinical
      remission and 25 (29%) of these reported IBS-like symptoms in remission during
      follow-up. There was no difference in inflammatory disease activity at the
      initial flare or in the prevalence of previous IBS symptoms when comparing
      UCR+IBS and UCR-IBS patients. The UCR+IBS patients reported more severe
      gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal pain, during their primary flare. 
      CONCLUSION: The severity and extent of inflammation at onset of UC do not seem to
      affect the development of IBS-like symptoms in UC patients during clinical
      remission. The high prevalence of IBS-like symptoms is not explained by
      pre-existing IBS. UCR+IBS patients reported more severe gastrointestinal symptoms
      at disease onset, which might indicate a more sensitive gastrointestinal tract in
      this category of patients.

TI  - Toward enteral nutrition for the treatment of pediatric Crohn disease in Canada: 
      a workshop to identify barriers and enablers.
PG  - 351-6
LID - 16819 [pii]
AB  - The treatment armamentarium in pediatric Crohn disease (CD) is very similar to
      adult-onset CD with the notable exception of the use of exclusive enteral
      nutrition (EEN [the administration of a liquid formula diet while excluding
      normal diet]), which is used more frequently by pediatric gastroenterologists to 
      induce remission. In pediatric CD, EEN is now recommended by the pediatric
      committee of the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation and the European
      Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition as a
      first-choice agent to induce remission, with remission rates in pediatric studies
      consistently >75%. To chart and address enablers and barriers of use of EEN in
      Canada, a workshop was held in September 2014 in Toronto (Ontario), inviting
      pediatric gastroenterologists, nurses and dietitians from most Canadian pediatric
      IBD centres as well as international faculty from the United States and Europe
      with particular research and clinical expertise in the dietary management of
      pediatric CD. Workshop participants ranked the exclusivity of enteral nutrition; 
      the health care resources; and cost implications as the top three barriers to its
      use. Conversely, key enablers mentioned included: standardization and sharing of 
      protocols for use of enteral nutrition; ensuring sufficient dietetic resources;
      and reducing the cost of EEN to the family (including advocacy for reimbursement 
      by provincial ministries of health and private insurance companies). Herein, the 
      authors report on the discussions during this workshop and list strategies to
      enhance the use of EEN as a treatment option in the treatment of pediatric CD in 
      Canada.

TI  - Identification of a common variant with potential pleiotropic effect on risk of
      inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer.
PG  - 999-1007

AB  - Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have separately identified many
      genetic susceptibility loci for ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD) and
      colorectal cancer (CRC), there has been no large-scale examination for
      pleiotropy, or shared genetic susceptibility, for these conditions. We used
      logistic regression modeling to examine the associations of 181 UC and CD
      susceptibility variants previously identified by GWAS with risk of CRC using data
      from the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium and the Colon 
      Cancer Family Registry. We also examined associations of significant variants
      with clinical and molecular characteristics in a subset of the studies. Among
      11794 CRC cases and 14190 controls, rs11676348, the susceptibility single
      nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) for UC, was significantly associated with reduced
      risk of CRC (P = 7E-05). The multivariate-adjusted odds ratio of CRC with each
      copy of the T allele was 0.93 (95% CI 0.89-0.96). The association of the SNP with
      risk of CRC differed according to mucinous histological features (P heterogeneity
      = 0.008). In addition, the (T) allele was associated with lower risk of tumors
      with Crohn's-like reaction but not tumors without such immune infiltrate (P
      heterogeneity = 0.02) and microsatellite instability-high (MSI-high) but not
      microsatellite stable or MSI-low tumors (P heterogeneity = 0.03). The minor
      allele (T) in SNP rs11676348, located downstream from CXCR2 that has been
      implicated in CRC progression, is associated with a lower risk of CRC,
      particularly tumors with a mucinous component, Crohn's-like reaction and
      MSI-high. Our findings offer the promise of risk stratification of inflammatory
      bowel disease patients for complications such as CRC.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Association of Signal transducers and activators of transcription-4
      (STAT4) gene polymorphism with susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease have 
      been investigated in a number of epidemiological studies, but the results are
      inclusive. The aim of this meta-analysis was to more precisely estimate the
      relationship. METHODS: The databases of Pubmed and CBM updated to October, 2014
      were retrieved. Random- or fixed-effect model was used to estimate odd radio (OR)
      and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95%CI) on the basis of heterogeneity. 
      RESULTS: Seven articles containing 2196 Crohn's disease (CD) cases, 1588
      ulcerative colitis (UC) cases and 4126 controls were identified. We detected a
      significant association between STAT4 rs7574865 polymorphism and IBD
      susceptibility in overall population (GG vs. GT+TT, OR=0.855, 95% CI=0.760-0.962,
      P=0.009), but not in Caucasian and Asian population, respectively. No association
      was detected between rs7574865 polymorphism and CD susceptibility in overall,
      Asian and Caucasian population, respectively. Interestingly, a significant
      association was detected between rs7574865 with UC susceptibility in overall
      population (G vs. T, OR=0.881, 95% CI=0.798-0.972, P=0.012; GG vs. GT+TT,
      OR=0.788, 95% CI=0.679-0.914, P=0.002; GG vs. TT, OR=0.683, 95% CI=0.498-0.937,
      P=0.018) and Caucasians (GG vs. GT+TT, OR=0.833, 95% CI=0.701-0.990, P=0.038;
      GG+GT vs. TT, OR=0.667, 95% CI=0.456-0.975, P=0.037; GG vs. TT, OR=0.636, 95%
      CI=0.433-0.934, P=0.021), respectively, and a possible association was found in
      Asian population (GG vs. GT+TT, OR=0.709, 95% CI=0.503-0.998, P=0.049).
      CONCLUSIONS: STAT4 rs7574865 gene is IBD risk factor, and this gene polymorphism 
      is associated with UC susceptibility, especially in Caucasians. To confirm these 
      findings, further studies with more sample size are required for a definitive
      conclusion.

TI  - Use of Acid Suppression Medication is Associated With Risk for C. difficile
      Infection in Infants and Children: A Population-based Study.
PG  - 912-7
LID - 10.1093/cid/civ432 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acid suppression medication is associated with Clostridium difficile 
      infection (CDI) in adults and is increasingly prescribed to children. This study 
      evaluated the relationship between acid suppression medication and incident CDI
      in children. METHODS: This was a population-based, nested case-control study.
      Patients were eligible if they were aged 0-17 years with 3 or more visits or 1
      year or more of follow-up in the dataset. Patients were excluded if they had
      comorbidities that associate with CDI and might also associate with acid
      suppression medication. Patients with codes for CDI were matched 1:5 with control
      patients by age, sex, medical practice, time of entry into the dataset, and
      follow-up time. The primary exposure was use of acid suppression medication with 
      proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) within 
      8-90 days. RESULTS: We identified 650 CDI cases and 3200 controls. The adjusted
      odds ratio (OR) for CDI and acid suppression medication was 7.66 (95% confidence 
      interval [CI], 3.24-18.1). Acid suppression medication was associated with CDI in
      infants aged <1 year (OR, 5.24; 95% CI, 1.13-24.4) and children aged 1-17 years
      (OR, 9.33; 95% CI, 3.25-26.8). There was increased risk for CDI with PPIs
      compared with H2RAs and with recent compared with distant exposure. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Acid suppression medication associated with CDI in infants and children in the
      outpatient setting, with an effect based on medication timing. Increased risk for
      CDI should be factored into the decision to use acid suppression medication in
      children.

TI  - The nondietary determinants of vitamin D status in pediatric inflammatory bowel
      disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between
      25-hydroxy vitamin D (25[OH]D) and markers of vitamin D status in inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case-control study of 
      59 pediatric patients with IBD (age 16.4 +/- 2.2 y) and 116 controls (age 14.6
      +/- 4.4 y), to investigate the association between 25(OH)D and albuminemia for
      protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) and hepatic dysfunction; alanine transaminase
      (ALT) for hepatic inflammation; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) for
      intestinal inflammation; body mass index (BMI) for adiposity; seasons and skin
      pigmentation for insolation. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as 25(OH)D < 50
      nmol/L; abnormal liver enzyme by ALT >40 U/L; overweight status by BMI of >/=85th
      but <95th percentile, and obesity by BMI >/=95th percentile. Seasons were
      categorized as summer, winter, spring, and fall. RESULTS: Patients with IBD had a
      higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (42.4% versus 26.7%; P = 0.04),
      elevated ALT (16.9% versus 2.6%; P < 0.001), and lower albumin (41.1 +/- 4.8
      versus 45.1 +/- 3.8; P < 0.001) than controls. In both the IBD cohort and
      controls, 25(OH)D was highest in summer and lowest in winter, and significantly
      higher in white than in non-white patients. ESR varied significantly with 25(OH)D
      (R(2) = 0.24; beta = -0.32; P = 0.010), and only patients with IBD with elevated 
      ESR had lower 25(OH)D than controls (49.5 +/- 25.2 versus 65.3 +/- 28.0 nmol/L; P
      = 0.045). CONCLUSION: Intestinal inflammation, not the loss of albumin-bound
      vitamin D in the gut, is the primary intestinal determinant of vitamin D status
      in IBD. The extraintestinal determinants are seasons and skin pigmentation, but
      not adiposity and hepatic inflammation.

AB  - Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders are a heterogeneous group of disorders
      characterized by no specific digestive symptoms associated with dense
      eosinophilic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract in the absence of known
      causes for such tissue eosinophilia. Among these diseases, eosinophilic
      gastroenteritis (EGE) and colitis (EC) are less common than esophagitis, but
      their incidence and prevalence have been increasing over the past decade due in
      part to increased disease recognition. The exact pathophysiology is not clear:
      EGE and EC are immune-mediated diseases implicating adaptive T-helper cell type 2
      immunity. According to the site of eosinophilic infiltration, there is a wide
      spectrum of digestive symptoms ranging from food refusal, nausea, vomiting,
      abdominal pain, weight loss, gastrointestinal bleeding (anemia), protein loosing 
      enteropathy, ascites, bowel obstruction or perforation for EGE and diarrhea +/-
      bleeding for CE. Endoscopic lesions are not specific: friability, erythematous
      mucosa with superficial erosions, or ulceration is often observed.
      Histologically, markedly increased numbers of mucosal eosinophils are seen in
      biopsy specimens. However, no standards for the diagnosis of EGE or CE exist and 
      few findings support the diagnosis: intraepithelial eosinophils, eosinophil crypt
      abscesses, and eosinophils in muscularis mucosa and/or submucosa. Other organs
      are not involved. The other causes of tissue eosinophilia (infections,
      inflammatory bowel diseases) should be excluded. Food allergy appears to play a
      central role in driving inflammation in EGE and CE, as evidenced by symptomatic
      improvement with initiation of food exclusion or elemental diets. Dietary
      treatment should be the first therapeutic option in children. If the elimination 
      diet fails, corticosteroids are currently the best characterized treatment but
      appropriate duration is unknown and relapses are frequent. In severe forms,
      immunomodulators or biologic agents (anti-IL5, anti-IgE, or anti-TNFa) can
      potentially play a role in the treatment of EGE and CE.

TI  - Identification of an anti-inflammatory protein from Faecalibacterium prausnitzii,
      a commensal bacterium deficient in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 415-425
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2014-307649 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD)-associated dysbiosis is characterised by a loss 
      of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, whose culture supernatant exerts an
      anti-inflammatory effect both in vitro and in vivo. However, the chemical nature 
      of the anti-inflammatory compounds has not yet been determined. METHODS:
      Peptidomic analysis using mass spectrometry was applied to F. prausnitzii
      supernatant. Anti-inflammatory effects of identified peptides were tested in
      vitro directly on intestinal epithelial cell lines and on cell lines transfected 
      with a plasmid construction coding for the candidate protein encompassing these
      peptides. In vivo, the cDNA of the candidate protein was delivered to the gut by 
      recombinant lactic acid bacteria to prevent dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid
      (DNBS)-colitis in mice. RESULTS: The seven peptides, identified in the F.
      prausnitzii culture supernatants, derived from a single microbial
      anti-inflammatory molecule (MAM), a protein of 15 kDa, and comprising 53% of
      non-polar residues. This last feature prevented the direct characterisation of
      the putative anti-inflammatory activity of MAM-derived peptides. Transfection of 
      MAM cDNA in epithelial cells led to a significant decrease in the activation of
      the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB pathway with a dose-dependent effect. Finally, the
      use of a food-grade bacterium, Lactococcus lactis, delivering a plasmid encoding 
      MAM was able to alleviate DNBS-induced colitis in mice. CONCLUSIONS: A 15 kDa
      protein with anti-inflammatory properties is produced by F. prausnitzii, a
      commensal bacterium involved in CD pathogenesis. This protein is able to inhibit 
      the NF-kappaB pathway in intestinal epithelial cells and to prevent colitis in an
      animal model.

TI  - Systematic review: Body composition in children with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 142-57

AB  - BACKGROUND: Paediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with weight
      loss, growth restriction and malnutrition. Bone mass deficits are well described,
      little is known about other body composition compartments. AIMS: To define the
      alterations in non-bone tissue compartments in children with IBD, and explore the
      effects of demographic and disease parameters. METHODS: A systematic search was
      carried out in the PubMed (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) and Web of Science
      databases in May 2014 (limitations age <17 years, and composition measurements
      compared with a defined control population). RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were
      included in this systematic review, reporting on a total of 1479 children with
      IBD [1123 Crohn's disease, 243 ulcerative colitis], pooled mean age 13.1 +/- 3.2 
      years, and 34.9% female. Data were highly heterogeneous, in terms of methodology 
      and patients. Deficits in protein-related compartments were reported. Lean mass
      deficits were documented in 93.6% of Crohn's disease and 47.7% of ulcerative
      colitis patients when compared with healthy control populations. Lower lean mass 
      was common to both sexes in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, deficits in
      females with persisted for longer. Fat-related compartment findings were
      inconsistent, some studies report reductions in body fat in new diagnosis/active 
      Crohn's disease. CONCLUSIONS: It is clear that almost all children with Crohn's
      disease and half with ulcerative colitis have reduced lean mass, however, body
      fat alterations are not well defined. To understand what impact this may have on 
      health and disease in children with IBD, further studies are needed to identify
      in which tissues these deficits lie, and to quantify body fat and its
      distribution.

TI  - Cloning and variation of ground state intestinal stem cells.
PG  - 173-8
LID - 10.1038/nature14484 [doi]
AB  - Stem cells of the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, liver and other columnar
      epithelia collectively resist cloning in their elemental states. Here we
      demonstrate the cloning and propagation of highly clonogenic, 'ground state' stem
      cells of the human intestine and colon. We show that derived stem-cell pedigrees 
      sustain limited copy number and sequence variation despite extensive serial
      passaging and display exquisitely precise, cell-autonomous commitment to
      epithelial differentiation consistent with their origins along the intestinal
      tract. This developmentally patterned and epigenetically maintained commitment of
      stem cells is likely to enforce the functional specificity of the adult
      intestinal tract. Using clonally derived colonic epithelia, we show that toxins A
      or B of the enteric pathogen Clostridium difficile recapitulate the salient
      features of pseudomembranous colitis. The stability of the epigenetic commitment 
      programs of these stem cells, coupled with their unlimited replicative expansion 
      and maintained clonogenicity, suggests certain advantages for their use in
      disease modelling and regenerative medicine.

      and diseased subjects.
PG  - e0126685
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0126685 [doi]
AB  - Large-scale cohort studies are currently being designed to investigate the human 
      microbiome in health and disease. Adequate sampling strategies are required to
      limit bias due to shifts in microbial communities during sampling and storage.
      Therefore, we examined the impact of different sampling and storage conditions on
      the stability of fecal microbial communities in healthy and diseased subjects.
      Fecal samples from 10 healthy controls, 10 irritable bowel syndrome and 8
      inflammatory bowel disease patients were collected on site, aliquoted immediately
      after defecation and stored at -80 degrees C, -20 degrees C for 1 week, at +4
      degrees C or room temperature for 24 hours. Fecal transport swabs (FecalSwab,
      Copan) were collected and stored for 48-72 hours at room temperature. We used
      pyrosequencing of the 16S gene to investigate the stability of microbial
      communities. Alpha diversity did not differ between all storage methods and -80
      degrees C, except for the fecal swabs. UPGMA clustering and principal coordinate 
      analysis showed significant clustering by test subject (p < 0.001) but not by
      storage method. Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and (un)weighted UniFrac showed a
      significant higher distance between fecal swabs and -80 degrees C versus the
      other methods and -80 degrees C samples (p < 0.009). The relative abundance of
      Ruminococcus and Enterobacteriaceae did not differ between the storage methods
      versus -80 degrees C, but was higher in fecal swabs (p < 0.05). Storage up to 24 
      hours (at +4 degrees C or room temperature) or freezing at -20 degrees C did not 
      significantly alter the fecal microbial community structure compared to direct
      freezing of samples from healthy subjects and patients with gastrointestinal
      disorders.

AB  - Gastrointestinal food allergies present during early childhood with a diverse
      range of symptoms. Cow's milk, soy and wheat are the three most common
      gastrointestinal food allergens. Several clinical syndromes have been described, 
      including food protein-induced enteropathy, proctocolitis and enterocolitis. In
      contrast with immediate, IgE-mediated food allergies, the onset of
      gastrointestinal symptoms is delayed for at least 1-2 hours after ingestion in
      non-IgE-mediated allergic disorders. The pathophysiology of these
      non-IgE-mediated allergic disorders is poorly understood, and useful in vitro
      markers are lacking. The results of the skin prick test or measurement of the
      food-specific serum IgE level is generally negative, although low-positive
      results may occur. Diagnosis therefore relies on the recognition of a particular 
      clinical phenotype as well as the demonstration of clear clinical improvement
      after food allergen elimination and the re-emergence of symptoms upon challenge. 
      There is a significant clinical overlap between non-IgE-mediated food allergy and
      several common paediatric gastroenterological conditions, which may lead to
      diagnostic confusion. The treatment of gastrointestinal food allergies requires
      the strict elimination of offending food allergens until tolerance has developed.
      In breast-fed infants, a maternal elimination diet is often sufficient to control
      symptoms. In formula-fed infants, treatment usually involves the use an
      extensively hydrolysed or amino acid-based formula. Apart from the use of
      hypoallergenic formulae, the solid diets of these children also need to be kept
      free of specific food allergens, as clinically indicated. The nutritional
      progress of infants and young children should be carefully monitored, and they
      should undergo ongoing, regular food protein elimination reassessments by
      cautious food challenges to monitor for possible tolerance development.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests a nutritional transition process in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease. Obesity, which was once an uncommon occurrence in
      such patients, has grown in this population at the same prevalence rate as that
      found in the general population, bringing with it an increased risk of
      cardiovascular disease. Objective The aim of the present study was to determine
      the nutritional status and occurrence of cardiovascular risk factors in patients 
      with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: A case-series cross-sectional study was
      conducted involving male and female adult outpatients with inflammatory bowel
      disease. Data were collected on demographic, socioeconomic, clinical and
      anthropometric variables as well as the following cardiovascular risk factors:
      sedentary lifestyle, excess weight, abdominal obesity, medications in use,
      comorbidities, alcohol intake and smoking habits. The significance level for all 
      statistical tests was set to 5% (P< 0.05). RESULTS: The sample comprised 80
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease, 56 of whom (70.0%) had ulcerative
      colitis and 24 of whom (30.0%) had Crohn's disease. Mean age was 40.3+/-11 years 
      and the female genre accounted for 66.2% of the sample. High frequencies of
      excess weight (48.8%) and abdominal obesity (52.5%) were identified based on the 
      body mass index and waist circumference, respectively, in both groups, especially
      among those with ulcerative colitis. Muscle depletion was found in 52.5% of the
      sample based on arm muscle circumference, with greater depletion among patients
      with Crohn's disease (P=0.008). The most frequent risk factors for cardiovascular
      disease were a sedentary lifestyle (83.8%), abdominal obesity (52.5%) and excess 
      weight (48.8%). CONCLUSION: The results of the complete anthropometric evaluation
      draw one's attention to a nutritional paradox, with high frequencies of both -
      muscle depletion, as well as excess weight and abdominal obesity.

AB  - OCTN1/SLC22A4 is expressed on apical membranes of small intestine, and is
      involved in gastrointestinal absorption of its substrates, including the
      food-derived antioxidant ergothioneine (ERGO). ERGO concentration in circulating 
      blood of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease) is lower than
      that in healthy volunteers; thus, circulating ERGO is a potential diagnostic
      marker, although the mechanisms underlying low ERGO concentration in patients are
      unknown. Here, we focused on intestinal macrophages, which infiltrate sites of
      inflammation, and examined possible first-pass uptake of ERGO by macrophages.
      ERGO concentration in blood was lower in mice with dextran sodium sulfate
      (DSS)-induced colitis than in controls. On the other hand, expression of octn1
      gene product and ERGO concentration in intestinal tissues of DSS-treated mice
      were higher than in controls. Interestingly, lamina propria mononuclear cells
      (LPMCs) isolated from DSS-treated mice contained ERGO and showed [(3)H]ERGO
      uptake and Octn1 expression, whereas ERGO was undetectable in LPMCs of control
      mice. Functional expression of OCTN1 was also confirmed in LPS-stimulated human
      macrophage-like cell line, THP-1. In conclusion, OCTN1 is functionally expressed 
      on activated intestinal macrophages, and ERGO uptake into these immune cells
      could contribute at least in part to the altered disposition of ERGO in
      intestinal inflammation.

TI  - Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Resveratrol in Patients with Ulcerative Colitis: A
      Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-controlled Pilot Study.
PG  - 280-5

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic idiopathic inflammatory
      disease in which reducing pro-inflammatory and/or increasing anti-inflammatory
      molecules is the mainstay of treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
      effects of supplementation with resveratrol as an antiinflammatory and
      antioxidant agent on inflammation and quality of life in patients with active UC.
      METHODS AND RESULTS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 
      50 eligible patients with active mild to moderate UC were supplemented with
      either a 500-mg resveratrol or placebo capsule for 6 weeks. Serum inflammatory
      markers, activity of NF-kappaB in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and
      quality of life were assessed at baseline and at the end of the study.
      Resveratrol supplementation led to a significant reduction in plasma levels of
      TNF-alpha (19.70 +/- 12.80 to 17.20 +/- 10.09 pg/mL) and hs-CRP (4764.25 +/-
      2260.48 to 2584.50 +/- 1792.80 ng/mL) and activity of NF-kappaB in PBMCs (0.19
      +/- 0.05 to 0.10 +/- 0.04 OD) (p <0.001), whereas there were no significant
      changes of these factors in placebo group. Also, the score of inflammatory bowel 
      disease questionnaire -9 (IBDQ-9) increased, whereas the clinical colitis
      activity index score decreased significantly in the resveratrol group (32.72 +/- 
      7.52 to 47.64 +/- 8.59) (p <0.001) and when compared with the placebo group
      (35.54 +/- 9.50 to 41.08 +/- 6.59) (p <0.001). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate
      that 6 weeks supplementation with 500 mg resveratrol can improve quality of life 
      and disease clinical colitis activity at least partially through inflammation
      reduction in patients with UC. Whether these effects will be continued in longer 
      duration of treatment remains to be determined.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Colonic strictures complicate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      and often lead to surgical resection to prevent dysplasia or cancer. We assessed 
      the frequency of dysplasia and cancer among IBD patients undergoing resection of 
      a colorectal stricture. METHODS: We analyzed data from the Groupe d'etudes et
      therapeutiques des affections inflammatoires du tube digestif study. This was a
      nationwide retrospective study of 12,013 patients with IBD in France who
      underwent surgery for strictures at 16 centers from August 1992 through January
      2014 (293 patients for a colonic stricture, 248 patients with Crohn's disease,
      51% male, median age at stricture diagnosis of 38 years). Participants had no
      preoperative evidence of dysplasia or cancer. We collected clinical, endoscopic, 
      surgical, and pathology data and information on outcomes. RESULTS: When patients 
      were diagnosed with strictures, they had IBD for a median time of 8 years (3-14).
      The strictures were a median length of 6 cm (4-10) and caused symptoms in 70% of 
      patients. Of patients with Crohn's disease, 3 (1%) were found to have low-grade
      dysplasia, 1 (0.4%) was found to have high-grade dysplasia, and 2 (0.8%) were
      found to have cancer. Of patients with ulcerative colitis, 1 (2%) had low-grade
      dysplasia, 1 (2%) had high-grade dysplasia, and 2 (5%) had cancer. All patients
      with dysplasia or cancer received curative surgery, except 1 who died of
      colorectal cancer during the follow-up period. No active disease at time of
      surgery was the only factor associated with dysplasia or cancer at the stricture 
      site (odds ratio, 4.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-21.27; P = .036).
      CONCLUSIONS: In a retrospective study of patients with IBD undergoing surgery for
      colonic strictures, 3.5% were found to have dysplasia or cancer. These findings
      can be used to guide management of patients with IBD and colonic strictures.

TI  - Assessing fatigue in inflammatory bowel disease: comparison of three fatigue
      scales.
PG  - 203-11
LID - 10.1111/apt.13255 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fatigue is commonly reported by patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD), both in quiescent and active disease. Few fatigue scales have been
      tested in IBD. AIM: To assess three fatigue assessment scales in IBD and to
      determine correlates of fatigue. METHODS: Potential participants (n = 2131) were 
      randomly selected from an IBD organisation's members' database; 605 volunteered
      and were posted three fatigue scales: Inflammatory Bowel Disease Fatigue scale,
      Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory and Multidimensional Assessment Fatigue scale 
      and questionnaires assessing anxiety, depression, quality of life (QoL) and IBD
      activity. The questionnaires were tested for stability over time with another
      group (n = 70) of invited participants. Internal consistency was measured by
      Cronbach's alpha and test-retest reliability by the intraclass correlation
      coefficient (ICC). RESULTS: Four hundred and sixty-five of 605 (77%)
      questionnaires were returned; of 70 invited, 48/70 returned test (68.6%) and
      41/70 (58.6%) returned retest. The three scales are highly correlated (P <
      0.001). Test-retest suggests reasonable agreement with ICC values between 0.65
      and 0.84. Lower age, female gender, IBD diagnosis, anxiety, depression and QoL
      were associated with fatigue (P < 0.001) on univariable analysis. However, on
      multivariable analysis only depression and low QoL were consistently associated
      with fatigue, while female gender was associated on most scales. IBD diagnosis,
      age and other factors were not consistently associated with severity or impact of
      fatigue once other variables were controlled for. CONCLUSIONS: All three fatigue 
      scales are likely to measure IBD fatigue adequately. Responsiveness to change has
      not been tested. Depression, poorer QoL and probably female gender are the major 
      associations of fatigue in IBD.

TI  - Dietary fatty acid intakes are related to the risk of ulcerative colitis: a
      case-control study.
PG  - 1255-60
LID - 10.1007/s00384-015-2232-8 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The role of dietary fatty acids in ulcerative colitis (UC)
      pathogenesis has been shown in animal models; however, human studies are rare. We
      hypothesized that there might be a relationship between dietary fatty acid
      composition and the risk of developing incident UC. MATERIAL AND METHODS:
      Overall, 62 new cases of UC and 124 healthy age and sex-matched controls were
      studied. Information on usual diet was measured by a validated country-specific
      food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Logistic regression analysis adjusting for
      potential confounding variables was carried out to compare dietary fatty acid
      intakes between cases and controls. RESULTS: We found positive associations
      between dietary intake of total fat (P value for trend <0.01), oleic acid (P
      value for trend <0.01), saturated fatty acid (SAFA) (P value for trend = 0.02),
      total polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) (P value for trend = 0.04), and trans fat
      (P value for trend <0.01). CONCLUSION: Our results showed that higher
      consumptions of total fats, oleic acid, SAFAs, total PUFAs, trans fat, MUFAs, and
      linoleic acid are significantly associated with increased risk for UC; however,
      no statistically significant associations were detected between the risk of
      disease and n-3 PUFAs and cholesterol intake.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the presentation, therapeutic management, and long-term
      outcome of children with very early-onset (VEO) (</= 5 years of age) inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD). STUDY DESIGN: Data were obtained from an inception cohort of
      1928 children with IBD enrolled in a prospective observational registry at
      multiple centers in North America. RESULTS: One hundred twelve children were </= 
      5 years of age with no child enrolled at <1 year of age. Of those, 42.9% had
      Crohn's disease (CD), 46.4% ulcerative colitis (UC), and 10.7% had
      IBD-unclassified. Among the children with CD, children 1-5 years of age had more 
      isolated colonic disease (39.6%) compared with 6- to 10-year-olds (25.3%, P =
      .04), and 11- to 16-year-olds (22.3%, P < .01). The change from a presenting
      colon-only phenotype to ileocolonic began at 6-10 years. Children 1-5 years of
      age with CD had milder disease activity (45.8%) at diagnosis compared with the
      oldest group (28%, P = .01). Five years postdiagnosis, there was no difference in
      disease activity among the 3 groups. However, compared with the oldest group, a
      greater proportion of 1- to 5-year-olds with CD were receiving corticosteroids (P
      < .01) and methotrexate (P < .01), and a greater proportion of 1- to 5-year-olds 
      with UC were receiving mesalamine (P < .0001) and thiopurine immunomodulators (P 
      < .0002). CONCLUSIONS: Children with VEO-CD are more likely to have mild disease 
      at diagnosis and present with a colonic phenotype with change to an ileocolonic
      phenotype noted at 6-10 years of age. Five years after diagnosis, children with
      VEO-CD and VEO-UC are more likely to have been administered corticosteroids and
      immunomodulators despite similar disease activity in all age groups. This may
      suggest development of a more aggressive disease phenotype over time.

PG  - 162398
LID - 10.1155/2015/162398 [doi]
AB  - The beneficial effects of carbohydrate-derived fibers are mainly attributed to
      modulation of the microbiota, increased colonic fermentation, and the production 
      of short-chain fatty acids. We studied the direct immune responses to alimentary 
      fibers in in vitro and in vivo models. Firstly, we evaluated the immunomodulation
      induced by nine different types of low-digestible fibers on human peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells. None of the fibers tested induced cytokine production in
      baseline conditions. However, only one from all fibers almost completely
      inhibited the production of anti- and proinflammatory cytokines induced by
      bacteria. Secondly, the impact of short- (five days) and long-term (three weeks) 
      oral treatments with selected fibers was assessed in the trinitrobenzene-sulfonic
      acid colitis model in mice. The immunosuppressive fiber significantly reduced
      levels of inflammatory markers over both treatment periods, whereas a
      nonimmunomodulatory fiber had no effect. The two fibers did not differ in terms
      of the observed fermentation products and colonic microbiota after three weeks of
      treatment, suggesting that the anti-inflammatory action was not related to
      prebiotic properties. Hence, we observed a direct effect of a specific fiber on
      the murine immune system. This intrinsic, fiber-dependent immunomodulatory
      potential may extend prebiotic-mediated protection in inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Successful Mercaptopurine Usage despite Azathioprine-Induced Pancreatitis in
      Paediatric Crohn's Disease.
PG  - 676-9
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv086 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Azathioprine [AZA] and mercaptopurine [MP] are recommended for
      maintenance of steroid-free remission in children with Crohn`s disease [CD].
      Azathioprine-induced pancreatitis, an idiosyncratic and major side effect, has
      been considered as an absolute contraindication for the use of a second
      thiopurine in IBD patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We describe two children with 
      CD in whom MP were successfully trialled after a confirmed azathioprine-induced
      pancreatitis, being well tolerated in both cases. RESULTS: Two boys [13 and 10
      years old] started exclusive enteral nutrition after diagnosis of moderate
      (Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index [wPCDAI] = 45) and mild [wPCDAI = 35]
      CD. Both developed an acute mild to moderate pancreatitis after 2 and 3 weeks,
      respectively, of AZA treatment but recovered fully in hospital after AZA
      withdrawal. They started on MP treatment without any adverse effect. They were
      tested for the presence of polymorphisms 238G>C, 460G>A, and 719A>G in the TPMT
      gene and 94C>A and 21>C in the ITPase. Both patients were wild-type for all
      tested polymorphisms. CONCLUSIONS: Azathioprine-induced acute pancreatitis should
      not be considered as an absolute contraindication for the use of MP. Further
      investigation is required to create a better understanding of the mechanism
      underlying the adverse events and to allow more possibilities for personalised
      therapy.

AB  - Children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are a group of
      patients with increasingly special health care needs. Transition from a pediatric
      and adolescent healthcare system into an adult medicine setting may be difficult 
      but nevertheless is very important to ensure physiological development of
      adolescent patients and of the continuity of their medical treatment. Transition 
      has shown to be a challenge for pediatricians and adult doctors as well. In
      Germany within the healthcare system there are no special structures established 
      to organize and optimize transition. The German Society for Pediatric
      Gastroenterology and Nutrition and the German Society of Internal Medicine have
      founded a working group to proceed the process of transition of young patients
      with IBD within the german health care.

TI  - Interleukin 6 Increases Production of Cytokines by Colonic Innate Lymphoid Cells 
      in Mice and Patients With Chronic Intestinal Inflammation.
PG  - 456-67.e15
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2015.04.017 [doi]
LID - S0016-5085(15)00573-9 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are a heterogeneous group of
      mucosal inflammatory cells that participate in chronic intestinal inflammation.
      We investigated the role of interleukin 6 (IL6) in inducing activation of ILCs in
      mice and in human beings with chronic intestinal inflammation. METHODS: ILCs were
      isolated from colons of Tbx21(-/-) x Rag2(-/-) mice (TRUC), which develop
      colitis; patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); and patients without
      colon inflammation (controls). ILCs were characterized by flow cytometry;
      cytokine production was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and
      cytokine bead arrays. Mice were given intraperitoneal injections of depleting
      (CD4, CD90), neutralizing (IL6), or control antibodies. Isolated colon tissues
      were analyzed by histology, explant organ culture, and cell culture. Bacterial
      DNA was extracted from mouse fecal samples to assess the intestinal microbiota.
      RESULTS: IL17A- and IL22-producing, natural cytotoxicity receptor-negative, ILC3 
      were the major subset of ILCs detected in colons of TRUC mice. Combinations of
      IL23 and IL1alpha induced production of cytokines by these cells, which increased
      further after administration of IL6. Antibodies against IL6 reduced colitis in
      TRUC mice without significantly affecting the structure of their intestinal
      microbiota. Addition of IL6 increased production of IL17A, IL22, and
      interferon-gamma by human intestinal CD3-negative, IL7-receptor-positive cells,
      in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: IL6 contributes to activation of colonic
      natural cytotoxicity receptor-negative, CD4-negative, ILC3s in mice with chronic 
      intestinal inflammation (TRUC mice) by increasing IL23- and IL1alpha-induced
      production of IL17A and IL22. This pathway might be targeted to treat patients
      with IBD because IL6, which is highly produced in colonic tissue by some IBD
      patients, also increased the production of IL17A, IL22, and interferon-gamma by
      cultured human colon CD3-negative, IL7-receptor-positive cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease (PIBD) is a chronic condition
      seen in genetically predisposed individuals. Genome-wide association studies have
      implicated >160 genomic loci in IBD with many genes coding for proteins in key
      immune pathways. This study looks at autoimmune disease burden in patients
      diagnosed with PIBD and interrogates exome data of a subset of patients. METHODS:
      Patients were recruited from the Southampton Genetics of PIBD cohort. Clinical
      diagnosis of autoimmune disease in these individuals was ascertained from medical
      records. For a subset of patients with PIBD and concurrent asthma, exome data was
      interrogated to ascertain the burden of pathogenic variants within genes
      implicated in asthma. Association testing was conducted between cases and
      population controls using the SKAT-O test. RESULTS: Forty-nine (28.3%) PIBD
      children (18.49% CD, 8.6% UC, and 21.15% IBDU patients) had a concurrent clinical
      diagnosis of at least one other autoimmune disorder; asthma was the most
      prevalent, affecting 16.2% of the PIBD cohort. Rare and common variant
      association testing revealed 6 significant genes (P < 0.05) before Bonferroni
      adjustment. Three of these genes were previously implicated in both asthma and
      IBD (ZPBP2 IL1R1, and IL18R1) and 3 in asthma only (PYHIN1, IL2RB, and GSTP1).
      CONCLUSIONS: One-third of our cohort had a concurrent autoimmune condition. We
      observed higher incidence of asthma compared with the overall pediatric
      prevalence. Despite a small sample size, SKAT-O evaluated a significant burden of
      rare and common mutations in 6 genes. Variant burden suggests that a systemic
      immune dysregulation rather than organ-specific could underpin immune dysfunction
      for a subset of patients.

AB  - Obesity is associated with altered gut microbiota and low-grade inflammation.
      Both dietary habits and food composition contribute to the onset of such
      diseases. Emulsifiers, compounds commonly used in a variety of foods, were shown 
      to induce body weight gain, low-grade inflammation and metabolic disorders. These
      dietary compounds promote gut microbiota alteration and gut barrier dysfunction
      leading to negative metabolic alterations.

TI  - Evaluation of diet pattern related to the symptoms of mexican patients with
      Ulcerative Colitis (UC): through the validity of a questionnaire.
PG  - 25
LID - 10.1186/s12937-015-0014-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is a chronic disease characterized by
      inflammation of colonic mucosa. Environmental factors such as dietary patterns
      may increase symptoms in UC patients. AIM: To validate and implement a
      questionnaire to identify foods that exacerbates symptoms in UC patients.
      METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted to validate and to assess the
      relationship of food and symptoms in Mexican UC patients. RESULTS: The IVC
      obtained was 0.56 in the questionnaire and kappa = 0.03 in foods from animal
      origin, 0.5 cereals and tubers, 0.2 legumes, 0.4 vegetables and fruits, 0.4 fats 
      and 0.3 in others. The evaluation was carried out in UC patients (n = 233), 65%
      active and 35% in UC remission, the current age was 45 (SD; 15) years in active
      UC and 40 (SD; 15) years in UC remission. Three food groups were made based on
      the frequency of symptoms: Group A; symptoms more often, especially the active vs
      remission (P <0.05); Group B caused more symptoms in remission UC vs active UC (P
      = 0.07) and Group C caused more symptoms in the active UC (P = 0.05). CONCLUSION:
      Foods with higher frequency of symptoms in patients with UC were: beans, whole
      milk, plum, lima beans and spicy sauce.

TI  - The association of infliximab trough levels with disease activity in pediatric
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1110-7
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2015.1027264 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Low serum trough levels (TLs) of infliximab (IFX) and antibodies to
      IFX (ATIs) are associated with the loss of therapeutic response in adults with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) receiving IFX. Until now, pediatric data are
      scarce. Therefore, we aimed to cross-sectionally investigate the association
      between ATIs and IFX TLs, and clinical and biochemical disease activity in
      children receiving IFX for IBD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Children aged <18 years
      receiving IFX maintenance treatment for Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative
      colitis (UC) at three Dutch hospitals were included. Prior to two consecutive IFX
      infusions, IFX TLs and ATI levels were measured. Clinical disease activity was
      determined by Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) and Pediatric
      Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI), for CD and UC, respectively.
      Biochemical disease activity was assessed by serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and
      fecal calprotectin (FC). Clinical remission was defined as a PUCAI or PCDAI score
      of <10. Therapeutic range of IFX was considered 3-7 microg/ml. RESULTS:
      Thirty-nine patients were included (31 CD; 16 females). Median age was 15 years. 
      Median IFX TL was 3.5 microg/ml [IQR 2-7]. Subtherapeutic and supratherapeutic
      TLs were found in 38% and 23% of children, respectively. ATIs were detected in
      four patients. A correlation was found between IFX TL and CRP [rs = -0.51; p <
      0.01] and FC [rs = -0.49; p < 0.01]. However, when only clinical disease activity
      was considered, no difference in median TL was found between remission and active
      disease (resp. 3.5 microg/ml [IQR 2-5] and 2.3 microg/ml [IQR 0.3-4.6]; p = 0.2).
      CONCLUSIONS: IFX TLs are related to biochemical markers of disease activity. This
      could provide a rationale for monitoring TLs in children receiving IFX for IBD.

PG  - 699-708
LID - 10.1586/1744666X.2015.1027687 [doi]
AB  - Thalidomide has anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenetic activity that makes it
      suitable for treating inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The recent guidelines
      from the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization/European Society for Pediatric
      Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition conclude that thalidomide cannot be
      recommended in refractory pediatric Crohn's disease but that it may be considered
      in selected cohorts of patients who are not anti-TNFalpha agent responders. The
      main adverse effect is the potential teratogenicity that renders the long-term
      use of thalidomide problematic in young adults due to the strict need for
      contraceptive use. In short-term use it is relatively safe; the most likely
      adverse effect is the neuropathy, which is highly reversible in children. So far 
      the use of thalidomide is reported in 223 adult and pediatric IBD patients (206
      with Crohn's disease). In the following sections, the authors will discuss
      efficacy and safety of thalidomide, in the short-term treatment of IBD.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Anemia is a common manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) that can greatly affect patients' quality of life. We performed a
      prospective study of a large cohort of patients with IBD to determine if patterns
      of anemia over time are associated with aggressive or disabling disease. METHODS:
      We performed a longitudinal analysis of demographic, clinical, laboratory, and
      treatment data from a registry of patients with IBD at the University of
      Pittsburgh Medical Center from 2009 through 2013. Patients with a complete
      follow-up evaluation (at least 1 annual visit with laboratory results) were
      included. Anemia was defined by World Health Organization criteria. Disease
      activity scores (the Harvey-Bradshaw Index or the ulcerative colitis activity
      index) and quality-of-life scores (based on the short IBD questionnaire) were
      determined at each visit; laboratory data, including levels of C-reactive protein
      and erythrocyte sedimentation rates, as well as patterns of IBD-related health
      care use, were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 410 IBD patients (245 with Crohn's
      disease, 165 with ulcerative colitis; 50.5% female) were included. The prevalence
      of anemia in patients with IBD was 37.1% in 2009 and 33.2% in 2013. Patients with
      IBD and anemia required significantly more health care and had higher indices of 
      disease activity, as well as a lower average quality of life, than patients
      without anemia (P < .0001). Anemia (persistent or recurrent) for 3 or more years 
      was correlated independently with hospitalizations (P < .01), visits to
      gastroenterology clinics (P < .001), telephone calls (P < .004), surgeries for
      IBD (P = .01), higher levels of C-reactive protein (in patients with ulcerative
      colitis, P = .001), and a higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P < .0001).
      Anemia was correlated negatively with quality-of-life scores (P < .03).
      CONCLUSIONS: Based on a longitudinal analysis of 410 patients, persistent or
      recurrent anemia correlates with more aggressive or disabling disease in patients
      with IBD.

TI  - Cultured blood T-cell responses predict anti-TNF therapy response in patients
      with ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1149-61
LID - 10.1111/apt.13192 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) therapy is used for treatment of
      ulcerative colitis (UC). As approximately 30% of patients with UC do not benefit 
      from the treatment, it is of clinical interest to identify biomarkers of response
      before therapy is initiated. AIM: To identify prognostic biomarkers of anti-TNF
      therapy response in anti-TNF therapy-naive patients with UC. METHODS: Peripheral 
      blood cells were obtained from 56 patients with UC before therapy started.
      Thirty-four patients were included in an exploratory cohort and 22 patients in a 
      validation cohort. Blood cells were stimulated in vitro with influenza vaccine
      with and without anti-TNF. T-cell surface receptor expression and cytokine
      release were determined (in total 17 variables). Treatment response was evaluated
      using the Mayo score 12-14 weeks after the first infusion. RESULTS: In the
      exploratory cohort, blood cells from the patients showed stronger
      anti-TNF-dependent suppression of T-cell surface receptor expression and cytokine
      secretion among therapy responders than nonresponders. In particular, anti-TNF
      suppressed the expression of CD25 on T cells and secretion of interleukin 5, to a
      higher degree in responders than in nonresponders. These variables were used to a
      create model to predict therapy outcome, which was confirmed in the validation
      cohort. Correct classification of future therapy response was achieved in 91% of 
      the cases in the validation cohort. CONCLUSION: The effects of anti-TNF on
      cultured blood T cells, obtained before therapy started, predict treatment
      outcome in patients with UC.

TI  - IPAA-related sepsis significantly increases morbidity of ileoanal pouch excision.
PG  - 488-93
LID - 10.1097/DCR.0000000000000330 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Perineal wound complications after ileoanal pouch excision remain a
      significant cause of morbidity. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this work was to
      describe the incidence, outcomes, and predictors of perineal wound complications 
      after pouch excision. DESIGN: This was a retrospective medical chart review.
      SETTINGS: The study was conducted in a single clinical institution. PATIENTS:
      Patients who underwent pouch excision at our institution from July 1992 through
      July 2012 were identified. Patient and perioperative variables were reviewed.
      Multivariate and univariate analyses were undertaken. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
      Perineal wound (including perineal wound infection and persistent perineal sinus 
      [nonhealing by 6 months]) and perineal hernia were measured. RESULTS: A total of 
      47 patients (mean age, 46 years; 42.6% men) with familial adenomatous polyposis
      (10.6%), mucosal ulcerative colitis (61.7%), or Crohn's disease (27.7%) underwent
      pouch excision, including 36.2% for IPAA-related sepsis (presacral abscess;
      perineal-, sacral-, or pouch-vaginal fistula; and anastomotic defect), 44.7% for 
      pouch dysfunction, 10.6% for refractory pouchitis, and 8.5% for neoplasia.
      Fourteen (29.8%) developed perineal wound complications, including 100% perineal 
      wound infection, 28.6% persistent perineal sinus, and 7.1% perineal hernia.
      Perineal wound infection was associated with delayed healing (>6 weeks; 71.4% vs 
      24.2%; p = 0.002) and IPAA-related sepsis (28.6% vs 0%; p = 0.001). Patients with
      and without perineal wound complications were similar in age, diagnoses, fecal
      diversion, immunosuppression, comorbid conditions, nutrition, and surgical
      variables. Most patients underwent intersphincteric dissection (87.2%) with
      primary perineal closure (97.0%). Perineal wound complications were significantly
      associated with IPAA-related sepsis as an indication for pouch excision (57.1% vs
      27.2%; p = 0.05), intraoperative pouch perforation (35.7% vs 9.1%, p =0.03), and 
      smoking (21.4% vs 3.0%; p = 0.04). IPAA-related sepsis and a current smoking
      status (OR, 19.3 [95% CI, 1.8 -488.1]) are significant independent predictors on 
      multivariate logistic regression (OR, 6.4 [95% CI, 1.4-30.2]) of perineal wound
      complications. All of the patients with persistent perineal sinus achieved
      successful healing at a median of 734 days (range, 363-2182 days), requiring a
      median of 1.5 procedures. LIMITATIONS: This was a single-center retrospective
      review with a small sample size. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative IPAA-related sepsis
      and current smoking are significant risk factors for perineal wound complications
      after pouch excision.

TI  - Endogenous levels of circulating androgens and risk of Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis among women: a nested case-control study from the nurses'
      health study cohorts.
PG  - 1378-85
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000385 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Androgens, which are known to be altered by exogenous hormone use,
      have recently been linked to alterations of the gut microbiome and mucosal immune
      function. No study has evaluated the association between circulating levels of
      androgens and risk of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: 
      We conducted a nested case-control study of women enrolled in the Nurses' Health 
      Study and Nurses' Health Study II who provided a blood specimen. Cases of CD and 
      UC were each matched to 2 controls. Prediagnosis plasma levels of
      dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, testosterone, and sex hormone-binding globulin
      were measured. We examined the association of each analyte with risk of CD or UC 
      using conditional logistic regression models. RESULTS: Compared with women in the
      lowest quintile of testosterone, the multivariable-adjusted odds ratios for CD
      were 0.86 (95% confidence interval, 0.39-1.90) for women in the second quintile, 
      0.49 (95% confidence interval, 0.21-1.15) for the third quartile, 0.22
      (0.08-0.65) for the fourth quintile, and 0.39 (95% confidence interval,
      0.16-0.99) for the highest quintile (Plinear trend = 0.004). In contrast, we did 
      not observe a consistent association between prediagnostic testosterone and risk 
      of UC (Plinear trend = 0.84). We also did not observe any association between
      plasma levels of sex hormone-binding globulin or dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate
      and risk of UC or CD (all Plinear trends > 0.10). CONCLUSIONS: Among women,
      prediagnostic circulating testosterone is associated with a lower risk of CD but 
      not UC. Further studies to understand the biological mechanisms by which
      endogenous androgens may mediate the etiopathogenesis of CD are warranted.

TI  - Out-of-pocket Cost Burden in Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A
      Cross-sectional Cohort Analysis.
PG  - 1368-77
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000374 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), consisting of Crohn's
      disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), can result in significant morbidity
      requiring frequent health care utilization. Although it is known that the overall
      financial impact of pediatric IBD is significant, the direct out-of-pocket (OOP) 
      cost burden on the parents of children with IBD has not been explored. We
      hypothesized that affected children with a more relapsing disease course and
      families in lower income strata, ineligible for need-based assistance programs,
      disparately absorb ongoing financial stress. METHODS: We completed a
      cross-sectional analysis among parents of children with IBD residing in
      California using an online HIPAA-secure Qualtrics survey. Multicenter recruitment
      occurred between December 4, 2013 and September 18, 2014 at the point-of-care
      from site investigators, informational flyers distributed at regional CCFA
      conferences, and social media campaigns equally targeting Northern, Central, and 
      Southern California. IBD-, patient-, and family-specific information were
      collected from the parents of pediatric patients with IBD patients younger than
      18 years of age at time of study, carry a confirmed diagnosis of CD or UC, reside
      in and receive pediatric gastroenterology care in California, and do not have
      other chronic diseases requiring ongoing medical care. RESULTS: We collected 150 
      unique surveys from parents of children with IBD (67 CD; 83 UC). The median
      patient age was 14 years for both CD and UC, with an overall 3.7 years (SD 2.8
      yr) difference between survey completion and time of IBD diagnosis. Annually,
      63.6%, 28.6%, and 5.3% of families had an OOP cost burden >$500, >$1000, and
      >5000, respectively. Approximately one-third (36.0%) of patients had emergency
      department (ED) visits over the past year, with 59.2% of these patients spending 
      >$500 on emergency department copays, including 11.1% who spent >$5000. Although 
      43.3% contributed <$500 on procedure and test costs, 20.0% spent >$2000 in the
      past year. Families with household income between $50,000 and $100,000 had a
      statistically significant probability (80.6%) of higher annual OOP costs than
      families with lower income <$50,000 (20.0%; P < 0.0001) or higher income
      >$100,000 (64.6%; P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that clinical
      variables associated with uncontrolled IBD states correlated to higher OOP cost
      burden. Annual OOP costs were more likely to be >$500 among patients who had
      increased spending on procedures and tests (odds ratio [OR], 5.63; 95% confidence
      interval [CI], 2.73-11.63), prednisone course required over the past year (OR,
      3.19; 95% CI, 1.02-9.92), at least 1 emergency department visit for IBD symptoms 
      (OR, 2.84; 95% CI, 1.33-6.06), at least 4 or more outpatient primary medical
      doctor visits for IBD symptoms (OR, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.40-5.68), and history of 4 or
      more lifetime hospitalizations for acute IBD care (OR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.13-5.96). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Previously undocumented, a high proportion of pediatric IBD families
      incur substantial OOP cost burden. Patients who are frequently in relapsing and
      uncontrolled IBD states require more acute care services and sustain higher OOP
      cost burden. Lower middle income parents of children with IBD ineligible for
      need-based assistance may be particularly at risk for financial stress from OOP
      costs related to ongoing medical care.

TI  - Clostridium difficile ribotype 027: relationship to age, detectability of toxins 
      A or B in stool with rapid testing, severe infection, and mortality.
PG  - 233-41
LID - 10.1093/cid/civ254 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) can cause severe disease and
      death, especially in older adults. A better understanding of risk factors for
      adverse outcomes is needed. This study tests the hypotheses that infection with
      specific ribotypes and presence of stool toxins independently associate with
      severity and constructs predictive models of adverse outcomes. METHODS: Cases of 
      non-recurrent CDI were prospectively included after positive stool tests for
      toxins A and/or B by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or tcdB by polymerase chain
      reaction. Outcomes included severe CDI (intensive care unit admission, colectomy,
      or death attributable to CDI within 30 days of diagnosis) and 30-day all-cause
      mortality. Adjusted models were developed to test hypotheses and predict
      outcomes. RESULTS: In total, 1144 cases were included. The toxin EIA was positive
      in 37.2% and 35.6% of patients were of age >65 years. One of the 137 unique
      ribotypes was ribotype 027 (16.2%). Detectable stool toxin did not associate with
      outcomes. Adjusting for covariates, including age, Ribotype 027 was a significant
      predictor of severe CDI (90 cases; odds ratio [OR], 1.73; 95% confidence interval
      [CI], 1.03-2.89; P = .037) and mortality (89 cases; OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.19-3.43; 
      P = .009). Concurrent antibiotic use associated with both outcomes. Both
      multivariable predictive models had excellent performance (area under the curve
      >0.8). CONCLUSIONS: Detection of stool toxin A and/or B by EIA does not predict
      severe CDI or mortality. Infection with ribotype 027 independently predicts
      severe CDI and mortality. Use of concurrent antibiotics is a potentially
      modifiable risk factor for severe CDI.

TI  - Clinical tube weaning supported by hunger provocation in fully-tube-fed children.
PG  - 538-43
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000647 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Children with congenital malformations, mental retardation, and
      complex early medical history frequently have feeding problems. Although tube
      feeding is effective in providing the necessary energy and nutrients, it
      decreases the child's motivation to eat and may lead to oral aversion. In this
      study, we sought to confirm our previous results, showing that a
      multidisciplinary clinical hunger provocation program may lead to quick
      resumption of oral feeding. METHODS: In a crossover study, 22 children of 9 to 24
      months of age who were fully dependent on tube feeding were randomly assigned to 
      one of two groups: group A, intervention group (2-week multidisciplinary clinical
      hunger provocation program); and group B, control group (4-week outpatient
      treatment by the same multidisciplinary team). Patients failing one treatment
      were reassigned to the other treatment group. Primary outcome measures were at
      least 75% orally fed at the conclusion of the intervention and fully orally fed
      and gaining weight 6 months after the intervention. RESULTS: In group A, 9/11
      patients were successfully weaned from tube feeding (2 failures: 1 developed
      ulcerative colitis, 1 drop-out). In group B, only 1 patient was weaned
      successfully; 10/11 were reassigned to the clinical hunger provocation program,
      all being weaned successfully. Six months after the intervention, 1 patient had
      to resume tube feeding. In total, in the control group, 1/11 (9%) was weaned
      successfully as compared with 18/21 (86%) in the hunger provocation group (P <
      0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Multidisciplinary clinical hunger provocation is an
      effective short-term intervention for weaning young children from tube feeding.

      and Crohn's disease, are chronic disorders characterized by worsening of symptoms
      followed by symptom-free periods. Symptoms have a profound negative impact on
      quality of life and are associated with increased health care utilization.
      Despite effective treatments, outcomes are suboptimal secondary to nonadherence, 
      medication intolerance, inconsistent monitoring, poor patient knowledge and
      limited access to care. OBJECTIVES: Compare disease activity and quality of life 
      over 1 year in a randomized trial of IBD patients receiving standard care versus 
      telemedicine. METHODS: Patients evaluated at 3 IBD referral centers with
      worsening symptoms within the last 2 years are eligible for randomization to one 
      of two interventions or standard care. The interventions consist of either every 
      other week or weekly assessment of symptoms, side effects, weight and delivery of
      medication prompts and education via texts to the participant's mobile phone.
      Individualized alerts and action plans are created on a secure portal.
      Participants in the standard care group undergo routine and urgent follow-up
      visits and telephone calls. The primary outcomes group comparisons of changes in 
      disease activity and quality of life scores from baseline to 6 and 12 months.
      CONCLUSIONS: Methods such as telemedicine are needed to improve monitoring,
      adherence, self-efficacy, and patient knowledge in IBD. If effective,
      telemedicine should decrease symptoms, improve quality of life, and decrease
      health care utilization. The burden associated with use of telemedicine for
      patients and providers needs to be assessed. The trial is ongoing and will be
      completed in July 2016.

TI  - Review article: applying pharmacokinetics to optimise dosing of anti-TNF
      biologics in acute severe ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1094-103
LID - 10.1111/apt.13175 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC), the most aggressive
      presentation of ulcerative colitis (UC), occurs in 15% of adults and children
      with UC. First line therapy with intravenous corticosteroids is ineffective in
      half of adults and one-third of children. Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies
      against TNF (anti-TNF therapy) are emerging as a common treatment for ASUC due to
      their similar efficacy to calcineurin inhibitors and more favourable adverse
      effect profile. AIM: To comprehensively review the evidence for anti-TNF therapy 
      for ASUC in children and adults with regard to outcomes and pharmacokinetics.
      METHODS: PubMed and recent conference proceedings were searched using the terms
      'ulcerative colitis', 'acute severe ulcerative colitis', 'anti-TNF',
      'pharmacokinetics' and the generic names of specific anti-TNF agents. RESULTS:
      Outcomes after anti-TNF therapy for ASUC remain suboptimal with about one half of
      children and adults undergoing colectomy. While several randomised controlled
      trials have demonstrated the efficacy of anti-TNF therapy for ambulatory patients
      with moderate to severely active UC, patients in these studies were less ill than
      those with ASUC. Patients with ASUC may exhibit more rapid clearance of anti-TNF 
      biologics due to pharmacokinetic mechanisms influenced by disease severity.
      CONCLUSIONS: Conventional weight-based dosing effective in patients with
      moderately to severely active UC, may not be equally effective in those with
      acute severe ulcerative colitis. Personalised anti-TNF dosing strategies, which
      integrate patient factors and early measures of pharmacokinetics and response,
      hold promise for ensuring sustained drug exposure and maximising early mucosal
      healing in patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Suspected fetal onset of neonatal transient eosinophilic colitis and development 
      of respiratory distress.
PG  - 734-8
LID - 10.1111/ped.12577 [doi]
AB  - Neonatal transient eosinophilic colitis (NTEC) is a new disease concept within
      eosinophilic gastroenteritis, which was proposed by Ohtsuka et al. It causes
      hematochezia as a result of eosinophilia, in neonates who have not yet started to
      receive enteral nutrition, although the whole-body status of the infant is in
      fact relatively good. To date, there have been no reports of this disease in
      which abnormalities were noted during gestation, and the clinical phenomena
      surrounding it, along with any complications, are not yet clear. We encountered a
      suspected case of NTEC causing respiratory distress with aspiration of
      hematochezia, in which dilated bowel was noted during gestation. This case
      indicates that NTEC may occur at the fetal stage and be complicated by
      respiratory distress.

TI  - The use of probiotics in pediatric gastroenterology: a review of the literature
      and recommendations by Latin-American experts.
PG  - 199-216
LID - 10.1007/s40272-015-0124-6 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The stability and composition of intestinal flora plays a vital role
      in human wellbeing throughout life from as early as birth. Over the past 50
      years, several studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of probiotic
      administration in pediatric gastroenterology. This document aims to provide a
      recommendation score on probiotic utilization in pediatric gastroenterology,
      together with a review of current knowledge concerning its benefits,
      tolerability, and safety. STUDY DESIGN: Published literature was selected without
      study design restriction: clinical guidelines, meta-analyses, randomized
      controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, outcomes research and case-controlled
      studies were selected using the following MESH-validated terms: probiotics,
      diarrhea, acute diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, traveler's diarrhea,
      bacterial diarrhea, nosocomial diarrhea, prophylactic diarrhea, Helicobacter
      pylori infection, colic, infantile colic, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC),
      inflammatory bowel disease, constipation, and allergy. Once the validity and the 
      quality of results were evaluated, a recommendation score and level of evidence
      were assigned for pediatric gastrointestinal-related conditions, according to the
      updated Evidence-Based Medicine guidelines: 1a for systematic review (SR) of
      RCTs, 1b for individual RCT, 1c for SR and individual RCT, 2a for SR of cohort
      studies, 2b for individual cohort studies, 2c for outcomes research, and 3a for
      SR of case-control studies. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The Latin American Expert
      group consensus recommends the use of the following probiotics for pediatric
      gastrointestinal conditions: prevention of acute infectious diarrhea (AID): 1b
      for Bifidobacterium lactis, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), and L. reuteri;
      prevention of nosocomial diarrhea: 1 b for B. lactis Bb12, B. bifidum, LGG and
      Streptococcus thermophiles; treatment of AID: 1a for LGG and S. boulardii, 1b for
      L. reuteri; prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea: 1b for LGG and S.
      boulardii; prevention of traveler's diarrhea: 1b for S. boulardii; prevention of 
      infantile colic: 1a for L. reuteri DSM 17938; treatment of infantile colic: 1b
      for L. reuteri DSM 17938; prevention of NEC: 1a for B. breve, mixtures of
      Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus, LGG, L. acidophilus and L. reuteri DSM 17938; 
      induction and maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis: 1b for VSL#3;
      improving symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome: 2c for LGG and VSL#3.

TI  - PedsQL gastrointestinal symptoms scales and gastrointestinal worry scales in
      pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease in comparison with healthy
      controls.
PG  - 1115-24
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000351 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcomes are essential in determining the broad
      impact of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and treatments from the patient's
      perspective. The primary study objectives were to compare the gastrointestinal
      symptoms and worry of pediatric patients with IBD with matched healthy controls
      and to compare Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis with each other using the
      Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Gastrointestinal Symptoms and
      Gastrointestinal Worry Scales. METHODS: PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms and
      Worry Scales were completed in a 9-site study by 256 pediatric patients with IBD 
      and 259 parents of patients (263 families; Crohn's disease [n = 195], ulcerative 
      colitis [n = 68]). Ten Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales measuring stomach pain,
      stomach discomfort when eating, food and drink limits, trouble swallowing,
      heartburn and reflux, nausea and vomiting, gas and bloating, constipation, blood 
      in poop, and diarrhea were administered along with 2 Gastrointestinal Worry
      Scales. A matched group of 384 healthy children families completed the PedsQL in 
      an Internet survey. RESULTS: PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Worry Scales
      distinguished between pediatric patients with IBD in comparison with healthy
      controls (P < 0.001), with larger effect sizes for symptoms indicative of IBD,
      supporting known-groups validity and clinical interpretability including minimal 
      important difference scores. Patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis 
      did not demonstrate significantly different gastrointestinal symptoms or worry in
      comparison with each other. CONCLUSIONS: The PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms and
      Worry Scales may be used as common metrics across pediatric patients with IBD,
      including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis separately to measure
      gastrointestinal-specific symptoms in clinical research and practice.

TI  - The role of probiotic lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria in the prevention
      and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and other related diseases: a
      systematic review of randomized human clinical trials.
PG  - 505878
LID - 10.1155/2015/505878 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn's disease (CD) and
      ulcerative colitis (UC), is a chronic inflammation of the small intestine and
      colon caused by a dysregulated immune response to host intestinal microbiota in
      genetically susceptible subjects. A number of fermented dairy products contain
      lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and bifidobacteria, some of which have been
      characterized as probiotics that can modify the gut microbiota and may be
      beneficial for the treatment and the prevention of IBD. The objective of this
      review was to carry out a systematic search of LAB and bifidobacteria probiotics 
      and IBD, using the PubMed and Scopus databases, defined by a specific equation
      using MeSH terms and limited to human clinical trials. The use of probiotics
      and/or synbiotics has positive effects in the treatment and maintenance of UC,
      whereas in CD clear effectiveness has only been shown for synbiotics.
      Furthermore, in other associated IBD pathologies, such as pouchitis and
      cholangitis, LAB and bifidobacteria probiotics can provide a benefit through the 
      improvement of clinical symptoms. However, more studies are needed to understand 
      their mechanisms of action and in this way to understand the effect of probiotics
      prior to their use as coadjuvants in the therapy and prevention of IBD
      conditions.

TI  - The role of enteral nutrition in patients with inflammatory bowel disease:
      current aspects.
PG  - 197167
LID - 10.1155/2015/197167 [doi]
AB  - Enteral nutrition (EN) is considered to be of great importance in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and nutritional problems. This comprehensive
      review is aiming to provide the reader with an update on the role of EN in IBD
      patients. EN can reduce Crohn's disease (CD) activity and maintain remission in
      both adults and children. Nutritional support using liquid formulas should be
      considered for CD patients and in serious cases of ulcerative colitis (UC),
      especially for those who may require prolonged cycles of corticosteroids. Given
      that the ultimate goal in the treatment of CD is mucosal healing, this advantage 
      of EN over corticosteroid treatment is valuable in therapeutic decision-making.
      EN is indicated in active CD, in cases of steroid intolerance, in patient's
      refusal of steroids, in combination with steroids in undernourished individuals, 
      and in patients with an inflammatory stenosis of the small intestine. No
      differences between the efficiency of elemental diets and nonelemental formulas
      have been noticed. EN must be the first choice compared to TPN. EN has a
      restricted value in the treatment of patients with large bowel CD. In conclusion,
      it seems important not to underestimate the role of nutrition as supportive care 
      in patients with IBD.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease in pediatric patients: Characteristics of newly
      diagnosed patients from the CEDATA-GPGE Registry.
PG  - 121-7
LID - 10.3238/arztebl.2015.0121 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can arise at any age, with peak
      incidence in adolescence and young adulthood. A registry of pediatric cases of
      IBD offers the opportunity to document their diagnosis and treatment, with the
      ultimate aim of improving diagnosis and treatment in the future. METHODS: In the 
      German-language CEDATA-GPGE registry, 3991 cases of IBD in patients less than 18 
      years of age were documented from 2004 to 2014. The 1257 patients who were
      prospectively included in the registry upon diagnosis and whose further course
      was documented for at least three months were analyzed in two separate
      groups--under 10 years old, and 10 years and above--with respect to the type and 
      duration of their symptoms until diagnosis, the completeness of the diagnostic
      evaluation, the disease phenotype, and the initial treatment. RESULTS: Of the 958
      patients for whom full documentation was available, 616 (64.3%) had Crohn's
      disease (CD), 278 (29%) had ulcerative colitis (UC), 64 (6.7%) had an
      unclassified IBD, and 23.2% were under 10 years old. The latency to diagnosis was
      longer for CD than for UC (0.5 versus 0.3 years), regardless of age. 62.5% of the
      CD patients had ileocolonic involvement, and more than half had involvement of
      the upper gastrointestinal tract. 71% of the patients with UC had subtotal
      colitis or pancolitis. Continuous improvement was seen in diagnostic assessment
      according to published guidelines. For example, in 2004/2005, 69% of patients
      were evaluated endoscopically with ileocolonoscopy and
      esophagogastroduodenoscopy; this fraction had risen to nearly 100% by 2013/2014. 
      Similarly, the percentage of patients who underwent a diagnostic evaluation of
      the small intestine, as recommended, rose from 41.2% to 60.9% over the same
      period. The most common initial treatments were 5- amino - salicylates (86.8% CD,
      100% UC) and glucocorticoids (60.6% CD, 65.6% UC). 32% of the patients with CD
      received exclusive enteral nutrition therapy. CONCLUSION: Most of these pediatric
      patients with IBD, whether in the younger or the older age group, had extensive
      bowel involvement at the time of diagnosis. The registry data imply that
      improvement in clinical course may be achieved by shortening the time to
      diagnosis and by closer adherence to the diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines.

LID - 10.1155/2015/931574 [doi]
AB  - Many immune-based intestinal disorders, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
      disease, as well as other illnesses, may have the intestines as an initial cause 
      or aggravator in the development of diseases, even apparently not correlating
      directly to the intestine. Diabetes, obesity, multiple sclerosis, depression, and
      anxiety are examples of other illnesses discussed in the literature. In parallel,
      importance of the gut microbiota in intestinal homeostasis and immunologic
      conflict between tolerance towards commensal microorganisms and combat of
      pathogens is well known. Recent researches show that the immune system, when
      altered by the gut microbiota, influences the state in which these diseases are
      presented in the patient directly and indirectly. At the present moment, a
      considerable number of investigations about this subject have been performed and 
      published. However, due to difficulties on correlating information, several
      speculations and hypotheses are generated. Thus, the present review aims at
      bringing together how these interactions work-gut microbiota, immune system, and 
      their influence in the neuroimmune system.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex, multi-factorial disease thought to
      arise from an inappropriate immune response to commensal bacteria in a
      genetically susceptible person that results in chronic, cyclical, intestinal
      inflammation. Dietary and environmental factors are implicated in the initiation 
      and perpetuation of IBD; however, a singular causative agent has not been
      identified. As of now, the role of environmental priming or triggers in IBD onset
      and pathogenesis are not well understood, but these factors appear to synergize
      with other disease susceptibility factors. In previous work, we determined that
      the polysaccharide dietary additive, maltodextrin (MDX), impairs cellular
      anti-bacterial responses and suppresses intestinal anti-microbial defense
      mechanisms. In this addendum, we review potential mechanisms for dietary
      deregulation of intestinal homeostasis, postulate how dietary and genetic risk
      factors may combine to result in disease pathogenesis, and discuss these ideas in
      the context of recent findings related to dietary interventions for IBD.

      inflammatory bowel disease: does immunoglobulin A mark the spot?

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, debilitating condition
      characterized by relapsing and remitting episodes of gastrointestinal
      inflammation. As the incidence and prevalence have increased, so has our
      understanding of the pathophysiology of this complex, immunologically mediated
      disease. With advances in bacterial and human gene sequencing technologies, a
      significant amount of work has focused on how alterations in the intestinal
      microbiome affect disease onset and progression. A recent study in Cell suggests 
      that it may be possible to identify specific bacteria responsible for promoting a
      proinflammatory state by assessing the degree to which they are coated by the
      immunoglobulin (Ig) A. A combination of antibody-based bacterial cell sorting,
      flow cytometry, and 16s ribosomal RNA gene sequencing was used to identify
      IgA-coated bacteria from stool of specific pathogen-free mice. This technique was
      used to demonstrate that IgA-coated bacteria were indeed detectable and increased
      in a mouse model of colitis. Stool from patients with IBD was then used to
      generate 2 groups of IgA+ and IgA- bacterial consortia. When transplanted into
      specific pathogen-free mice, no initial clinical differences were noted. However,
      when mice with dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis were transplanted with the 
      IgA+ bacterial strains, they exhibited severe exacerbation of intestinal
      inflammation, whereas the IgA- group developed minimal symptoms. These findings
      suggest that bacteria highly coated with IgA are potentially responsible for
      driving gut inflammation in patients with IBD. These results may represent a
      critical advance in our understanding of the complex interactions between the
      host immune system and commensal microorganisms as it relates to the development 
      and disease course of IBD. Future work will focus on how these findings can be
      translated into the development of individualized, microbiota-specific therapies.

TI  - Developing in vitro expanded CD45RA+ regulatory T cells as an adoptive cell
      therapy for Crohn's disease.
PG  - 584-94
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2014-306919 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Thymus-derived regulatory T cells (Tregs) mediate dominant
      peripheral tolerance and treat experimental colitis. Tregs can be expanded from
      patient blood and were safely used in recent phase 1 studies in graft versus host
      disease and type 1 diabetes. Treg cell therapy is also conceptually attractive
      for Crohn's disease (CD). However, barriers exist to this approach. The stability
      of Tregs expanded from Crohn's blood is unknown. The potential for adoptively
      transferred Tregs to express interleukin-17 and exacerbate Crohn's lesions is of 
      concern. Mucosal T cells are resistant to Treg-mediated suppression in active CD.
      The capacity for expanded Tregs to home to gut and lymphoid tissue is unknown.
      METHODS: To define the optimum population for Treg cell therapy in CD,
      CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(lo)CD45RA(+) and CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(lo)CD45RA(-) Treg subsets 
      were isolated from patients' blood and expanded in vitro using a workflow that
      can be readily transferred to a good manufacturing practice background. RESULTS: 
      Tregs can be expanded from the blood of patients with CD to potential target dose
      within 22-24 days. Expanded CD45RA(+) Tregs have an epigenetically stable FOXP3
      locus and do not convert to a Th17 phenotype in vitro, in contrast to CD45RA(-)
      Tregs. CD45RA(+) Tregs highly express alpha4beta7 integrin, CD62L and CC motif
      receptor 7 (CCR7). CD45RA(+) Tregs also home to human small bowel in a C.B-17
      severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) xenotransplant model. Importantly, in
      vitro expansion enhances the suppressive ability of CD45RA(+) Tregs. These cells 
      also suppress activation of lamina propria and mesenteric lymph node lymphocytes 
      isolated from inflamed Crohn's mucosa. CONCLUSIONS:
      CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(lo)CD45RA(+) Tregs may be the most appropriate population from
      which to expand Tregs for autologous Treg therapy for CD, paving the way for
      future clinical trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Few case reports describe the clinical features of pancreatic
      involvement in inflammatory bowel disease. AIM: To investigate prevalence and
      disease course of inflammatory bowel disease children with pancreatitis and with 
      exclusive hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia. METHODS: We used a web-registry to 
      retrospectively identify paediatric inflammatory bowel disease patients with
      hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia. Participants were re-evaluated at 6 months
      and 1 year. RESULTS: From a total of 649 paediatric patients, we found 27 with
      hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia (4.1%). Eleven patients (1.6%) fulfilled
      diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis. Female gender was significantly
      associated with acute pancreatitis (p=0.04). Twenty-five children (92.5%) had
      colonic disease. At 6 months 1/11 children with acute pancreatitis (9%) showed
      acute recurrent pancreatitis, while 1 patient (9%) had persistent hyperamylasemia
      and hyperlipasemia. At 12 months, 1 patient showed chronic pancreatitis (9.1%).
      Of the 16 children with exclusive hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia, 4 developed
      acute pancreatitis (25%), while 1 patient (6.2%) still presented exclusive
      hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia at 6 months. At 12 months, 11/16 patients
      (68.7%) reached a remission of pancreatic involvement, whereas 5 remaining
      patients (32.3%) had persistent hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia. CONCLUSIONS: 
      In inflammatory bowel disease children, acute pancreatitis is more common in
      colonic disease and in female gender. Pancreatic function should be monitored,
      considering that pancreatic damage may evolve.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients may be at a higher risk for developing 
      infections due to underlying disease, malnutrition, surgery, or immunosuppressive
      therapy. Therefore, protecting this group against infections is of particular
      importance. Immunisation against vaccine-preventable diseases is strongly
      recommended. This article for the first time summarises data on immunogenicity
      and safety of vaccines in IBD children and provides an update on some important
      issues regarding immunisation in these group of children.

TI  - Anti-TNF therapy for paediatric IBD: the Scottish national experience.
PG  - 399-405
LID - 10.1136/archdischild-2013-305812 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Biological agents are being increasingly used in the UK for 
      paediatric-onset inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD) despite limited evidence and
      safety concerns. We evaluated effectiveness and safety in the clinical setting,
      highlighting drug cost pressures, using our national Scottish PIBD biological
      registry. METHODS: Complete usage of the biological agents, infliximab (IFX) and 
      adalimumab (ADA) for treatment of PIBD (in those aged <18 years) from 1 January
      2000 to 30 September 2010 was collated from all treatments administered within
      the Scottish Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (PGHAN)
      national managed service network (all regional PGHAN centres and paediatric units
      within their associated district general hospitals). RESULTS: 132 children had
      biological therapy; 24 required both agents; 114 had Crohn's disease (CD), 16 had
      ulcerative colitis (UC) and 2 had IBD Unclassified (IBDU). 127 children received 
      IFX to induce remission; 61 entered remission, 49 had partial response and 17 had
      no response. 72 were given maintenance IFX and 23 required dose escalation. 18
      had infusion reactions and 27 had adverse events (infections/other adverse
      events). 29 had ADA to induce remission (28 CD and 1 UC), 24 after IFX; 10
      entered remission, 12 had partial response and 7 had no response. All had
      maintenance; 19 required dose escalation. 12 children overall required
      hospitalisation due to drug toxicity. No deaths occurred with either IFX or ADA. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Complete accrual of the Scottish nationwide 'real-life' experience
      demonstrates moderate effectiveness of anti tumour necrosis factor agents in
      severe PIBD but duration of effect is limited; significant financial issues (drug
      cost-need for dose escalation and/or multiple biological usage) and safety issues
      exist.

TI  - Extraintestinal manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease and intestinal
      tuberculosis: Frequency and relation with disease phenotype.
PG  - 43-50
LID - 10.1007/s12664-015-0538-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) in inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), as well as
      intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) from Asia, are underreported. We, therefore,
      describe the prevalence of EIMs in Indian IBD and ITB patients and study their
      relationship with disease extent and severity in IBD. METHODS: This retrospective
      single-center study included all IBD and ITB patients evaluated from January 2005
      to July 2012. Disease profile and frequencies of arthropathies (peripheral and
      central) and ocular (episcleritis, iritis/uveitis), oral (aphthous stomatitis),
      skin (erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum, psoriasis), hepatobiliary (primary 
      sclerosing cholangitis), and thromboembolic manifestations were analyzed.
      RESULTS: Of 1,652 patients (1146 UC, 303 CD, 203 ITB), frequency of any EIM was
      33.2 %, 38.3 %, and 14.3 % in UC, CD, and ITB patients, respectively.
      Thromboembolism was more common among UC patients with pancolitis than proctitis 
      (p < 0.001) and left-sided colitis (p = 0.02). Primary sclerosing cholangitis was
      seen in 0.4 % UC patients. Steroid-dependent UC patients had higher frequency of 
      any EIM, peripheral arthropathy, or thromboembolism than patients with no or
      infrequent steroid requirement (p < 0.05). Peripheral arthropathy (p = 0.02),
      erythema nodosum (p = 0.01), and aphthous stomatitis (p = 0.004) were more common
      with CD than with UC patients. Patients with colonic CD had higher frequency of
      peripheral arthropathy, any EIM, and multiple EIMs than ileal or ileocolonic
      disease (p < 0.05). Relative to ITB, CD patients had higher frequencies of
      peripheral arthropathy (p < 0.001), aphthous stomatitis (p = 0.01), any EIM (p < 
      0.001), and multiple EIMs (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In Indian IBD and ITB
      patients, EIMs appear to be related to disease severity in UC and disease
      location in CD and are significantly more common in CD than in ITB. Overall
      prevalence of EIMs in these patients is similar to that of the West.

      the intestine is critical for intestinal immunosurveillance; however, the
      cellular processes that orchestrate this balance during IBD remain poorly
      defined. With the use of a mouse model of TNF-driven Crohn's-like ileitis
      (TNF(Delta) (ARE)), we examined the role of CCR7 in the control of intestinal T
      cell and DC retention/egress during experimental CD. We observed that the
      frequency of CCR7-expressing TH1/TH17 effector lymphocytes increased during
      active disease in TNF(Delta) (ARE) mice and that DeltaARE/CCR7(-/-) mice
      developed exacerbated ileitis and multiorgan inflammation, with a marked
      polarization and ileal retention of TH1 effector CD4(+) T cells. Furthermore,
      adoptive transfer of DeltaARE/CCR7(-/-) effector CD4(+) into lymphopenic hosts
      resulted in ileo-colitis, whereas those transferred with DeltaARE/CCR7(+/+)
      CD4(+) T cells developed ileitis. DeltaARE/CCR7(-/-) mice had an acellular
      draining MLN, decreased CD103(+) DC, and decreased expression of RALDH enzymes
      and of CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) Tregs. Lastly, a mAb against CCR7 exacerbated
      ileitis in TNF(Delta) (ARE) mice, phenocopying the effects of congenital CCR7
      deficiency. Our data underscore a critical role for the lymphoid chemokine
      receptor CCR7 in orchestrating immune cell traffic and TH1 versus TH17 bias
      during chronic murine ileitis.

TI  - Serum C-reactive protein and CRP genotype in pediatric inflammatory bowel
      disease: influence on phenotype, natural history, and response to therapy.
PG  - 596-605
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000296 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute phase reactant. Patients with
      pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD) differ from adult patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease with regard to phenotype, inflammatory profile, and
      treatment response. We hypothesized that variations in CRP and CRP genotype
      influence PIBD phenotype, natural history, and remission after anti-tumor
      necrosis factor alpha therapy. METHODS: Six single nucleotide polymorphisms
      tagging CRP (rs1935193, rs1130864, rs1205, rs1417938, rs11265263, and rs1800947) 
      were genotyped in 465 patients with PIBD (diagnosed <17 yr). Phenotyping was
      serially performed until last follow-up and serum CRP levels recorded at
      diagnosis and before biological therapy in a subgroup. RESULTS: CRP haplotype
      (ATGCTC) differed in those diagnosed <10 years, with rs1205T more frequent in
      Crohn's disease (CD) than ulcerative colitis (UC) (P = 0.009); the haplotype
      ATGCTC was less frequent in UC (P = 0.002). Three single nucleotide polymorphisms
      (rs1205, rs1130864, and rs1417938) showed association with elevated CRP levels at
      diagnosis. CRP genotype had no association with CD phenotype or natural history. 
      CRP was more frequently raised at diagnosis in CD than UC (63% versus 22%, P <
      0.0001). Elevated CRP at diagnosis was associated with a higher risk of
      progression to surgery in patients with CD (P < 0.0001) and the need for
      azathioprine in the overall PIBD cohort (P = 0.002). There was no effect of CRP
      genotype or serum CRP on the achievement of remission using anti-tumor necrosis
      factor alpha therapy. CONCLUSIONS: CRP and CRP genotype differ between pediatric 
      patients with CD and UC with a high inflammatory burden at diagnosis suggesting a
      worse prognosis. Additional evaluation of CRP in inflammatory bowel disease
      pathogenesis and natural history is now warranted.

LID - S0092-8674(15)00003-3 [pii]
AB  - Decreases in the diversity of enteric bacterial populations are observed in
      patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Less is known
      about the virome in these diseases. We show that the enteric virome is abnormal
      in CD and UC patients. In-depth analysis of preparations enriched for free
      virions in the intestine revealed that CD and UC were associated with a
      significant expansion of Caudovirales bacteriophages. The viromes of CD and UC
      patients were disease and cohort specific. Importantly, it did not appear that
      expansion and diversification of the enteric virome was secondary to changes in
      bacterial populations. These data support a model in which changes in the virome 
      may contribute to intestinal inflammation and bacterial dysbiosis. We conclude
      that the virome is a candidate for contributing to, or being a biomarker for,
      human inflammatory bowel disease and speculate that the enteric virome may play a
      role in other diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIM: Although inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients are at risk 
      for metabolic bone disease, studies analyzing this correlation have identified
      various risk factors, including disease phenotype, age, sex and steroid therapy. 
      Furthermore, few studies have assessed risk factors for bone loss in Japanese IBD
      patients. This study analyzed risk factors for metabolic bone disease in Japanese
      IBD patients. METHODS: This cross-sectional study assessed 388 patients with IBD 
      aged 20-50 years, including 232 with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 156 with Crohn's
      disease (CD). Bone mineral density of the femoral neck, total femur and lumbar
      spine was quantified by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The blood
      concentrations of bone metabolism markers were measured. History of smoking and
      bone fracture, and nutritional intake were assessed using questionnaires.
      RESULTS: Of the 388 patients with IBD, 78 (20.1%; UC, 17.2%; CD, 24.4%) had
      osteopenia and 17 (4.4%; UC, 3.4%; CD, 5.8%) had osteoporosis, as assessed by
      T-score. Bone mineral density of the lumbar vertebrae was lower in males than in 
      females. Multivariate regression analysis showed that risk factors for bone loss 
      in UC patients were male sex, low body mass index (BMI), high steroid dose and
      disease location. Risk factors for bone loss in CD patients were male sex and low
      BMI. CONCLUSION: Among Japanese patients with IBD, male sex and low BMI were
      associated with increased risk for metabolic bone disease. In addition, Steroid
      therapy shouldn't be indiscriminate in UC patients. These findings may help
      identify patients at particularly high risk of metabolic bone disease and may
      help implement appropriate therapies in a timely manner and improve long-term
      quality of life.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Methyl donor deficiency (MDD) aggravates experimental colitis in rats
      and increases endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress through decreased sirtuin 1
      (SIRT1) in neuronal cells and myocardium. ER stress plays a key role in IBD
      pathogenesis. AIM: We investigated whether the influence of MDD on colitis
      resulted from an ER stress response triggered by decreased SIRT1 expression.
      DESIGN: The unfolded protein response (UPR), chaperones proteins, heat shock
      factor protein 1 (HSF1) and SIRT1 were examined in rats with MDD and dextran
      sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in a Caco-2 cell model with stable
      expression of transcobalamin-oleosin (TO) chimera, which impairs cellular
      availability of vitamin B12, and in IBD. The effects of SIRT1 activation were
      studied both in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: MDD aggravated DSS-induced colitis
      clinically, endoscopically and histologically. MDD activated ER stress pathways, 
      with increased phosphorylate-PKR-like ER kinase, P-eiF-2alpha, P-IRE-1alpha,
      activating transcription factor (ATF)6, XBP1-S protein and ATF4 mRNA expression
      levels in rats. This was accompanied by reduced SIRT1 expression level and
      greater acetylation of HSF1, in relation with a dramatic decrease of chaperones
      (binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP), heat shock protein (HSP)27 and HSP90).
      Adding either vitamin B12, S-adenosylmethionine or an SIRT1 activator (SRT1720)
      reduced the UPR in vitro. In rats, SIRT1 activation by SRT1720 prevented colitis 
      by reducing HSF1 acetylation and increasing expression of BIP, HSP27 and HSP90.
      Immunohistochemistry showed impaired expression of SIRT1 in the colonic
      epithelium of patients with IBD. CONCLUSIONS: SIRT1 is a master regulator of ER
      stress and severity of experimental colitis in case of MDD. It could deserve
      further interest as a therapeutic target of IBD.

AB  - Intestinal permeability plays a critical role in the etiopathogenesis of
      ulcerative colitis. Defensins, including porcine beta-defensin (pBD)2, are
      crucial antimicrobial peptides for gut protection owing to their antibacterial
      and immunomodulatory activities. The purpose of this study was to investigate the
      protective effects of pBD2 on mucosal injury and the disruption of the epithelial
      barrier during the pathological process of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced
      colitis. The effects and mechanism of pBD2 were evaluated both using a
      DSS-induced C57BL/6 mouse model and, in vitro, using Caco-2 and RAW264.7 cells.
      DSS-induced colitis was characterized by higher disease activity index, shortened
      colon length, elevated activities of myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase,
      histologic evidence of inflammation, and increased expression levels of
      TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-8. pBD2 increased the expression of zonula occludens-1,
      zonula occludens-2, claudin-1, mucin-1, and mucin-2 mRNA and proteins, and it
      decreased permeability to FITC-D, as well as apoptosis, in DSS-treated mice. pBD2
      also decreased inflammatory infiltrates of the colon epithelium. In Caco-2 cells,
      pBD2 increased transepithelial electrical resistance and mucin mRNA expression,
      and it decreased the permeability of FITC-D while preserving the structural
      integrity of the tight junctions. The effects of pBD2 appeared to be through
      upregulation of the expression of genes associated with tight junctions and
      mucins, and by suppressing DSS-induced increases in inflammation, inducible NO
      synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, and apoptosis. These results show that pBD2 improves 
      DSS-induced changes in mucosal lesions and paracellular permeability, possibly by
      affecting the activation of NF-kappaB signaling. The present study demonstrates
      that intrarectal administration of pBD2 may be a novel preventive option for
      ulcerative colitis.

AB  - Some of the most common symptoms of the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD, which
      include ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) are abdominal pain, diarrhea, and
      weight loss. It is therefore not surprising that clinicians and patients have
      wondered whether dietary patterns influence the onset or course of IBD. The
      question of what to eat is among the most commonly asked by patients, and among
      the most difficult to answer for clinicians. There are substantial variations in 
      dietary behaviors of patients and recommendations for them, although clinicians
      do not routinely endorse specific diets for patients with IBD. Dietary clinical
      trials have been limited by their inability to include a placebo control,
      contamination of study groups, and inclusion of patients receiving medical
      therapies. Additional challenges include accuracy of information on dietary
      intake, complex interactions between foods consumed, and differences in food
      metabolism among individuals. We review the roles of diet in the etiology and
      management of IBD based on plausible mechanisms and clinical evidence.
      Researchers have learned much about the effects of diet on the mucosal immune
      system, epithelial function, and the intestinal microbiome; these findings could 
      have significant practical implications. Controlled studies of patients receiving
      enteral nutrition and observations made from patients on exclusion diets have
      shown that components of whole foods can have deleterious effects for patients
      with IBD. Additionally, studies in animal models suggested that certain nutrients
      can reduce intestinal inflammation. In the future, engineered diets that restrict
      deleterious components but supplement beneficial nutrients could be used to
      modify the luminal intestinal environment of patients with IBD; these might be
      used alone or in combination with immunosuppressive agents, or as salvage therapy
      for patients who do not respond or lose responsiveness to medical therapies.
      Stricter diets might be required to induce remission, and more sustainable
      exclusion diets could be used to maintain long-term remission.

TI  - Effects of obesity on severity of colitis and cytokine expression in mouse
      mesenteric fat. Potential role of adiponectin receptor 1.

AB  - In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), obesity is associated with worsening of the 
      course of disease. Here, we examined the role of obesity in the development of
      colitis and studied mesenteric fat-epithelial cell interactions in patients with 
      IBD. We combined the diet-induce obesity with the trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid
      (TNBS) colitis mouse model to create groups with obesity, colitis, and their
      combination. Changes in the mesenteric fat and intestine were assessed by
      histology, myeloperoxidase assay, and cytokine mRNA expression by real-time PCR. 
      Medium from human mesenteric fat and cultured preadipocytes was obtained from
      obese patients and those with IBD. Histological analysis showed inflammatory cell
      infiltrate and increased histological damage in the intestine and mesenteric fat 
      of obese mice with colitis compared with all other groups. Obesity also increased
      the expression of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1beta, TNF-alpha,
      monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, and keratinocyte-derived chemokine, while it 
      decreased the TNBS-induced increases in IL-2 and IFN-gamma in mesenteric adipose 
      and intestinal tissues. Human mesenteric fat isolated from obese patients and
      those with and IBD demonstrated differential release of adipokines and growth
      factors compared with controls. Fat-conditioned media reduced adiponectin
      receptor 1 (AdipoR1) expression in human NCM460 colonic epithelial cells. AdipoR1
      intracolonic silencing in mice exacerbated TNBS-induced colitis. In conclusion,
      obesity worsens the outcome of experimental colitis, and obesity- and
      IBD-associated changes in adipose tissue promote differential mediator release in
      mesenteric fat that modulates colonocyte responses and may affect the course of
      colitis. Our results also suggest an important role for AdipoR1 for the
      fat-intestinal axis in the regulation of inflammation during colitis.

AB  - Intestinal epithelial stem cells (IESCs) control the intestinal homeostatic
      response to inflammation and regeneration. The underlying mechanisms are unclear.
      Cytokine-STAT5 signaling regulates intestinal epithelial homeostasis and
      responses to injury. We link STAT5 signaling to IESC replenishment upon injury by
      depletion or activation of Stat5 transcription factor. We found that depletion of
      Stat5 led to deregulation of IESC marker expression and decreased LGR5(+) IESC
      proliferation. STAT5-deficient mice exhibited worse intestinal histology and
      impaired crypt regeneration after gamma-irradiation. We generated a transgenic
      mouse model with inducible expression of constitutively active Stat5. In contrast
      to Stat5 depletion, activation of STAT5 increased IESC proliferation, accelerated
      crypt regeneration, and conferred resistance to intestinal injury. Furthermore,
      ectopic activation of STAT5 in mouse or human stem cells promoted LGR5(+) IESC
      self-renewal. Accordingly, STAT5 promotes IESC proliferation and regeneration to 
      mitigate intestinal inflammation. STAT5 is a functional therapeutic target to
      improve the IESC regenerative response to gut injury.

      increased likelihood of surgery in pediatric IBD.
PG  - 307-14
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000284 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adult studies suggest antibodies to infliximab (ATI) correlate with
      loss of response in inflammatory bowel disease but pediatric data are limited.
      METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of trough infliximab levels and ATI
      in 134 pediatric and young adult patients receiving infliximab. At the time serum
      was obtained demographics, disease phenotype, duration of infliximab therapy, use
      of combination therapy (methotrexate or 6-mercaptopurine with infliximab), and
      surgery were recorded. RESULTS: Assays were performed on 134 subjects currently
      receiving infliximab (85 male; mean age, 17.3 +/- 4.3 years; 114 Crohn's disease 
      and 20 ulcerative colitis). Infliximab use ranged from 12 days to 12 years:
      median 2.0 (interquartile range [1.1-4.3]) years. Twenty-seven of 134 (20%)
      patients had ATI >/=5 U/mL. Of patients with ATI >/=5 U/mL, 59% had infliximab
      levels <5 mug/mL, compared with 14% of patients with ATI <5 U/mL (P < 0.001). Ten
      (7%) patients (9 Crohn's disease, 1 ulcerative colitis) underwent bowel
      resections after beginning infliximab infusions. Sixty percent who underwent
      surgery had ATI >/=12 U/mL; in contrast, only 8% of patients who did not undergo 
      surgery had ATI >/=12 U/mL (P = 0.01). At the time of serum sampling, 50 (37%)
      patients were receiving combination therapy, compared with 84 (63%) on infliximab
      alone. Combination therapy at the time of serum sampling did not correlate with
      either increase infliximab levels or lower ATI compared with infliximab
      monotherapy. However, prior immunomodulator use was associated with lower
      antibody levels (P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: ATI correlates with reduction in
      infliximab level and a higher risk of surgery in patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease.

PG  - 361-8
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000283 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity is associated with intestinal-specific inflammation.
      Nonetheless, a specific role of obesity in the etiology of inflammatory bowel
      disease is unclear. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of U.S.
      women enrolled in 1989 in the Nurses' Health Study II. At baseline, we collected 
      information on height, weight, waist and hip circumference, weight at age 18, and
      body shape at age 20. We used Cox proportional hazard models to calculate hazard 
      ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Among 111,498 women (median
      age, 35 yr), we documented 153 cases of Crohn's disease (CD) and 229 cases of
      ulcerative colitis (UC) more than 18 years of follow-up, encompassing 2,028,769
      person-years. Compared with women with normal BMI, the multivariate-adjusted
      hazard ratios of CD were 2.33 (95% CI, 1.15-4.69) for obese women at age 18 and
      1.58 (95% CI, 1.01-2.47) for obese women at baseline. Increasing weight gain
      between age 18 and baseline was associated with increased risk of CD (Ptrend =
      0.04). Adolescent body habitus was also associated with risk of CD with a
      multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio of CD of 1.63 (95% CI, 1.07-2.50) for women
      with overweight/obese body shape compared with women with a thin/slender body
      shape. We did not observe a significant association between any of these
      anthropometric measures and risk of UC. CONCLUSIONS: In a large prospective
      cohort of U.S. women, measures of adiposity were associated with an increased
      risk of CD but not UC. Additional studies are needed to elucidate the biological 
      mechanisms by which excess adiposity may increase the risk of CD.

TI  - High-density mapping of the MHC identifies a shared role for HLA-DRB1*01:03 in
      inflammatory bowel diseases and heterozygous advantage in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 172-9
LID - 10.1038/ng.3176 [doi]
AB  - Genome-wide association studies of the related chronic inflammatory bowel
      diseases (IBD) known as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis have shown strong 
      evidence of association to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). This
      region encodes a large number of immunological candidates, including the
      antigen-presenting classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules. Studies in 
      IBD have indicated that multiple independent associations exist at HLA and
      non-HLA genes, but they have lacked the statistical power to define the
      architecture of association and causal alleles. To address this, we performed
      high-density SNP typing of the MHC in >32,000 individuals with IBD, implicating
      multiple HLA alleles, with a primary role for HLA-DRB1*01:03 in both Crohn's
      disease and ulcerative colitis. Noteworthy differences were observed between
      these diseases, including a predominant role for class II HLA variants and
      heterozygous advantage observed in ulcerative colitis, suggesting an important
      role of the adaptive immune response in the colonic environment in the
      pathogenesis of IBD.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Many Chinese herbs are traditionally used as
      medicine to improve the functions of gastrointestinal tract. Some of these herbs 
      are also promising agents for the improvement of the gut microbiota and the
      treatment of ulcerative colitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: By screening seven
      traditional Chinese herbs, we found that Red Ginseng and Semen Coicis were the
      most effective in promoting the growth of probiotics including Lactobacillus and 
      Bifidobacterium in vitro. We then evaluated the effects of Red Ginseng and Semen 
      Coicis on the growth of the bacterial pathogens (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus
      aureus, and Salmonella spp.) in vitro. In in vivo experiment, we gavage
      administrated trinitro-benzene-sulfonic acid induced ulcerative colitis (UC) rats
      with Red Ginseng and Semen Coicis extracts. After two weeks treatment, we
      analyzed the structure of the gut microbiota and examined the UC symptoms by
      employing qPCR and animal pathology detection techniques. RESULTS: Both Red
      Ginseng and Semen Coicis promoted the growth of probiotics - Bifidobacterium and 
      Lactobacillus in vitro. Red Ginseng also inhibited the growth of some pathogen
      strains. In vivo, Red Ginseng and Semen Coicis improved the structure of gut
      microbiota and relieved the symptoms of ulcerative colitis in vivo. Compared with
      Semen Coicis, Red Ginseng was more effective in relieving the symptoms of
      ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Red Ginseng could promote the growth of
      probiotic bacteria in vitro. Red Ginseng and, to a lesser extent Semen Coicis,
      gave positive results in an experimental in vivo model for ulcerative colitis.

TI  - N-acetylcysteine and intestinal health: a focus on its mechanism of action.
PG  - 872-91
AB  - The integrity of the intestinal epithelium ensures its normal physiological
      function. Consequently, damage to the mucosal epithelium can impair the
      absorption of nutrients, thereby reducing the growth performance and compromising
      the health of animals. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is pharmaceutically available
      either intravenously, orally, or by inhalation for reducing endothelial
      dysfunction, inflammation, fibrosis, invasion, cartilage erosion, acetaminophen
      detoxification, and transplant prolongation. NAC is rapidly metabolized by the
      small intestine to produce glutathione and can not be detected in animals without
      supplementation. The physiologic functions and therapeutic effects of NAC are
      largely associated with maintaining intracellular concentrations of reduced
      glutathione. Results from recent studies indicate that NAC reduces inflammation, 
      alleviates oxidative stress, improves energy status, and ameliorates tissue
      damage in the intestine of lipopolysaccharide-challenged piglets. Moreover,
      dietary supplementation with NAC ameliorates acetic acid-induced colitis in a
      porcine model. The effects of NAC are associated with some intestinal cell
      signaling pathways, such as EGFR, TLR4, apoptosis and tight junction signaling.
      The current review focuses on the protective effects of NAC on intestinal health 
      and the molecular mechanisms of its action.

TI  - Surgery in the age of biological treatment.
PG  - 121-7
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2014.972445 [doi]
AB  - Surgery for IBD is in constant evolution; it does not appear that the
      introduction of biologicals has had a major effect on the chance of a patient
      being operated on or not. Pouch surgery had its heydays in the 80s and 90s and
      has since then become less frequent, but the number of patients undergoing
      surgery still seem about the same from one year to the other. Likewise, there is 
      no substantial evidence that surgery for Crohn's disease is diminishing. There
      have been fears that patients on biological treatment have an increased risk of
      postoperative complications. The issue is not completely settled but it is likely
      that patients on biological treatment who come to surgery are those who do not
      benefit from biologicals. Thus, they are compromised in that they have an ongoing
      inflammation, are in bad nutritional state, and might have several other known
      risk factors for a complicated postoperative course. These factors and perhaps
      not the biologicals per se is what surgeons should consider. During the recent
      years, we have seen several new developments in IBD surgery; the ileorectal
      anastomosis is being used for ulcerative colitis and laparoscopic surgery usually
      resulting in a shorter hospital stay, less pain, and better cosmetics. We have
      also seen the introduction of robotic surgery, single incision minimal invasive
      surgery, transanal minimal invasive surgery, and other approaches to minimize
      surgical trauma. Time will show which of these innovations patients will benefit 
      from.

TI  - Mucosal healing in the era of biologic agents in treatment of inflammatory bowel 
      disease.
PG  - 43-52
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2014.977943 [doi]
AB  - Mucosal healing has been a central issue in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) for 
      the last years, and has been proposed to be included as the new treatment goal in
      IBD. The molecular understanding of both the disruption and the healing of the
      intestinal epithelial cell lining and the mucosal barrier in IBD is complex and
      only partly understood. There is no general agreement on how to define healed
      mucosa, but there is a general acceptance that clinicians should use endoscopy
      and imaging technique in their assessments. Mucosal healing is an old concept
      that has been actualized in the present era of the highly effective biological
      agents. Randomized clinical studies with mucosal healing as end-point parameters 
      have been reported, and early mucosal healing has been associated with low
      complication rates. We are waiting for documentation of whether treatment to
      healed mucosa can change the natural course of IBD. The concept of immunological 
      remission has recently been introduced and can be the new treatment goal and one 
      of several criteria for discontinuation of biological treatment in IBD. In
      conclusion, mucosal healing is a fairly novel concept and goal for biological
      treatment of IBD. There is a need for a standardization of its assessment and
      validation of the prognostic value.

AB  - Characterized by colonic mucosa intraepithelial lymphocytosis, lymphocytic
      colitis is primarily an entity presented in the middle-aged to elderly patient
      population. Very few large series of lymphocytic colitis of childhood occurrence 
      are available in the medical literature. Ten cases each of lymphocytic colitis
      and of colonic lymphocytosis of other diagnosis, all with duodenal
      disaccharidases analysis data, were collected from the files of our institution. 
      The electronic medical records were reviewed and multiple variables were
      analyzed. The ten patients with lymphocytic colitis presented with diarrhea. Of
      these, three had abdominal pain. The age range was 2-18 years. Nearly all
      patients were Caucasian (90%) and 70% were female. Endoscopically, most had
      normal appearing colonic mucosa. Significant past medical history, family medical
      history and associated comorbidities included celiac disease, Down syndrome,
      juvenile arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. Interestingly, the most
      revealing observation was that the majority of cases (80%) were associated with
      lactase deficiency and, for the most part, gastrointestinal symptoms improved
      simply by treatment with Lactaid or avoidance of dairy products. This association
      is statistically significant. Our clinicopathological study indicates that the
      typical pediatric patient is a female Caucasian. A large of portion of the
      patients had associated lactase deficiency and improved on Lactaid supplement
      alone.

TI  - Risk factors for Crohn's disease of the neo-small intestine in ulcerative colitis
      patients with total proctocolectomy and primary or secondary ileostomies.
PG  - 170-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: De novo Crohn's disease (CD) of the neo-small intestine in ulcerative
      colitis (UC) patients after total proctocolectomy (TPC) is a new disease entity, 
      which may persist even after a secondary diverting permanent ileostomy for pouch 
      failure. We sought to compare outcomes of primary ileostomy (PI, i.e., stoma
      created after colectomy without trying of ileal pouch) and secondary ileostomy
      (SI, i.e., stoma created after pouch failure) and to evaluate factors associated 
      with the development of CD of the neo-small intestine proximal to ileostomy.
      METHODS: A total of 123 eligible patients were identified from our Pouch Center
      Registry (PI group, n = 57 and SI group, n = 66). Demographics, clinical features
      and outcomes (CD of theneo-small intestine, non-CD related strictures,
      requirement of CD-related medications use, ileostomy-associated hospitalization, 
      ileostomy failure with stoma revision/relocation, and shortgut syndrome) were
      compared. Step-wise logistic regression models were performed. RESULTS: The
      median follow-up for the whole cohort was 5.0 (2.0-12.0) years. Younger age at
      diagnosis and surgery, family history of IBD, toxic megacolon/fulminant colitis, 
      pre-diversion severe diarrhea, prediversion anti-TNF biological therapy,
      arthralgia/arthropathy and staged surgery were more common in the SI group (p <
      0.05). In multivariate analysis, the presence of SI [odds ratio (OR), 8.23; 95%
      confidence interval (CI), 2.43-27.85], family history of IBD (OR, 9.14; 95% CI,
      3.13-26.69), and pre-diversion of weight loss (OR, 3.72; 95% CI, 1.23-11.21) were
      contributing factors for developing CD of the neo-small intestine. CONCLUSIONS:
      CD of the neo-small intestine in stoma patients was associated with the presence 
      of SI, family history of IBD, and pre-diversion poor nutrition status. Patients
      with secondary ileostomy due to pouch failure should be carefully monitored.
      Aggressive medical, endoscopic or surgical therapy may be needed in patients at
      risk, before permanent diversion.

      associated chemokines linked to clinical therapy response in UC patients.
      METHODS: Blood and biopsies were obtained from anti-TNF therapy-naive UC patients
      (n = 43) before (baseline) and during induction therapy with infliximab. Therapy 
      response was evaluated at Week 14. Expression of monocyte activation markers and 
      levels of chemokines in serum and biopsies were determined. Quantitative
      proteomic analysis was performed in cultured mucosal biopsies, and obtained data 
      was validated in serum. RESULTS: In therapy responders, but not in
      non-responders, infliximab reduced blood monocyte expression of CD14 and CD86, 2 
      weeks after therapy commenced, relative to baseline. Serum CCL2 levels were
      decreased only among therapy responders at Week 2 and Week 14, relative to
      baseline. These data corresponded with lower levels of CD14, CD86 and CCL2 in
      intestinal tissue in responders as compared with non-responders at Week 14.
      Proteomic analysis of cultured biopsies showed that infliximab induced a
      reduction in Tenascin C that predicted downregulation of CCL2. Therapy
      responders, but not non-responders, had decreased serum Tenascin C levels at Week
      2 and Week 14, relative to baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab therapy response in 
      UC patients is associated with reduced monocyte activation and serum levels of
      CCL2 2 weeks after therapy commencement. In therapy responders, infliximab
      influenced Tenascin C, which might be a regulator of CCL2 expression and
      important for induction of the clinical therapy response.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Infliximab (IFX) has been used for over a decade worldwide. Less is
      known about the natural history of IFX use beyond a few years and which patients 
      are more likely to sustain benefits. METHODS: Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) 
      exposed to IFX from Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Saint-Antoine
      Hospital, Paris, and the Swiss IBD Cohort Study were identified through
      retrospective and prospective data collection, complemented by chart abstraction 
      of electronic medical records. We compared long-term users of IFX (>5 yr of
      treatment, long-term users of infliximab [LTUI]), with non-LTUI patients to
      identify prognostic factors. RESULTS: We pooled data on 1014 patients with CD
      from 3 different databases, of whom 250 were defined as LTUI. The comparison
      group comprised 290 patients with CD who discontinued IFX: 48 primary
      nonresponses, 95 loss of responses, and 147 adverse events. Factors associated
      with LTUI were colonic involvements and an earlier age at the start of IFX. The
      prevalence of active smokers and obese patients differed markedly, but inversely,
      between American and European centers but did not impact outcome. The
      discontinuation rate was stable around 3% to 6%, each year from years 3 to 10.
      CONCLUSIONS: Young age at start of IFX and colonic CD are factors associated with
      a beneficial long-term use of IFX. After 5 years of IFX, there is still a 3% to
      5% discontinuation rate annually. Several factors associated with a good initial 
      response such as nonsmoker and shorter disease duration at IFX initiation do not 
      seem associated with a longer term response.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We developed a new IgA and IgG anti-MZGP2 antibody ELISAs based on
      recombinant isoform-4 of human zymogen granule protein-2 (GP2), which is the
      major autoantigen of Crohn's disease (CrD)-specific pancreatic autoantibodies and
      assessed their clinical relevance in the largest inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      cohort tested to date. METHODS: 832 sera were studied, including 617 consecutive 
      IBD patients from 323 CrD and 294 ulcerative colitis (UC) follow-up in a tertiary
      centre, and 112 pathological and 103 normal controls. RESULTS: Sensitivity of IgA
      anti-MZGP2 for CrD in the IBD population was 15% and specificity was 98% (95,
      99), while the sensitivity and specificity of IgG anti-MZGP2 were 27% and 97%.
      IgA and IgG anti-MZGP2 combined testing led to a sensitivity of 31% and a
      specificity of 96%. Positivity for either ASCA (IgA or IgG) or anti-MZGP2 (IgA or
      IgG) showed a sensitivity of 75% (70, 80) and a specificity of 84% (79, 89). IgA 
      anti-MZGP2 antibodies were more prevalent in CrD patients with early disease
      onset (p=0.011). Also, anti-MZGP2 positive patients more frequently had extensive
      disease with ileal involvement. Patients with longer disease duration were more
      likely to have IgG anti-MZGP2 antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel ELISA confirms
      the high specificity of anti-MZGP2 antibodies for CrD and their association with 
      disease severity phenotypes.

TI  - Incidence, pattern, and etiology of elevated liver enzymes in pediatric
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 592-7
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000672 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) often develop elevated
      liver enzymes (ELE), which are frequently a benign, transient finding, but may be
      related to treatment or IBD-associated liver diseases. Distinguishing benign from
      pathologic ELE is crucial for focused diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.
      We sought to characterize the incidence, character, chronicity, degree, and
      etiology of ELE in children with IBD. METHODS: Institutional review
      board-approved retrospective review of all of the patients with IBD (2-21 years) 
      seen between October 2009 and October 2012 with >9 months of follow-up were
      included in the study. We examined body mass index, disease activity, extent,
      phenotype, concurrent medications, and character, chronicity, degree of enzyme
      elevation, and final diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 219 of 514 patients with IBD 
      had >/=1 episode of ELE. Five patients were excluded for preexisting liver
      disease, leaving 214 patients (Crohn disease [CD]: 14.8 +/- 3.5 years, 46% girls;
      ulcerative colitis [UC]: 14.4 +/- 4.2 years, 37% girls). One hundred forty-eight 
      patients (69%) had a hepatic, 17 (8%) cholestatic, and 49 (23%) mixed character
      of ELE. There were no significant differences in character, chronicity, or degree
      of ELE between CD and UC (P = 0.71, P = 0.58, P > 0.33). Of the 128 patients with
      sufficient data to determine chronicity, 98 (77%) had transient elevations, (CD: 
      n = 66, 75% and UC: n = 32, 80%). Episodes of ELE were idiopathic in 87% of
      patients with IBD. A final diagnosis of idiopathic ELE was associated with a
      lower degree of ELE elevation (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients with 
      IBD commonly experience transient, idiopathic ELE. Our findings suggest that
      higher degrees of ELE, specifically alanine aminotransferase, are associated with
      an etiology that requires more extensive evaluation.

TI  - Vitamin D as a novel therapy in inflammatory bowel disease: new hope or false
      dawn?
PG  - 5-12
LID - 10.1017/S0029665114001621 [doi]
AB  - There is increasing scientific interest in the field of vitamin D research,
      moving the focus beyond bone health to other disease processes. Low circulating
      vitamin D levels have been reported as a risk factor for several
      pathophysiologically divergent diseases, including cancers, diabetes, CVD,
      multiple sclerosis and inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and 
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). But, therein, remains the challenge: can any
      single nutrient contribute to multiple complex disease mechanisms and,
      ultimately, have therapeutic potential? The aim of this review is to critically
      evaluate several strands of scientific evidence surrounding vitamin D and
      inflammation, primarily focusing on IBD. Epidemiological studies suggest an
      increased incidence of IBD and rheumatoid arthritis in countries of more northern
      latitudes, mirroring sunlight patterns. A considerable body of evidence supports 
      the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D, at least in animal models of IBD.
      Although it is accepted that suboptimal vitamin D status is common in IBD, some
      studies suggest that this associates with more severe disease. With regard to
      treatment, the data are only beginning to emerge from randomised controlled
      trials to suggest that people with IBD may remain in remission longer when
      treated with oral vitamin D. In conclusion, several strands of evidence suggest
      that vitamin D may modify the immune response in IBD. There is a continued need
      for large well-designed clinical trials and mechanistic studies to determine if, 
      and how, this emerging promise translates into tangible clinical benefits for
      people with chronic debilitating diseases such as IBD.

AB  - We performed a prospective study of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases to 
      examine variations in treatment among medical centers. In a prospective cohort
      study of 1659 patients with Crohn's disease and 946 patients with ulcerative
      colitis seen at 7 high-volume referral centers, we collected data on
      demographics, disease characteristics, and medical and surgical treatments. We
      used logistic regression to determine differences in treatment among centers,
      controlling for potential confounders. We found significant variations among
      centers in the treatment of Crohn's disease with immunomodulators (odds ratio
      [OR], 3.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.09-5.32) but not anti-tumor necrosis 
      factor agents (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 0.97-2.77). There was less variation in the
      treatment of ulcerative colitis; we found no difference in use of
      immunomodulators (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.00-3.36) or anti-tumor necrosis factor
      therapy (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.40-1.65). The development and implementation of
      evidence-based standards of care for inflammatory bowel disease may help reduce
      variation and improve outcomes.

TI  - Incidence of microscopic colitis in the Netherlands. A nationwide
      population-based study from 2000 to 2012.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Incidence rates of microscopic colitis are mainly based on regional
      data from a limited number of countries. To evaluate geographical differences and
      changes over time, more nationwide incidence rates are needed. AIMS: The aim of
      this retrospective study was to assess the incidence rate of microscopic colitis 
      in the Netherlands in a nationwide cohort. METHODS: A search was performed in the
      Dutch pathology registry, covering records of all approximately 16.5 million
      inhabitants. Incident cases were defined as a first diagnosis of microscopic
      colitis (collagenous or lymphocytic colitis) between 2000 and 2012. RESULTS: In
      total, 7228 incident cases were identified with a mean annual incidence rate of
      3.4 per 100,000 person years. Collagenous colitis was present in 3741 cases and
      lymphocytic colitis in 2718 cases, with a mean annual incidence rate of 1.8 and
      1.3 per 100,000 person years, respectively. Remaining 769 cases were described as
      undefined microscopic colitis. Collagenous and lymphocytic colitis incidence
      rates increased significantly over time (p<0.001) with a male:female ratio of 1:3
      and 1:2, respectively. CONCLUSION: The Dutch mean annual incidence rates of
      collagenous and lymphocytic colitis were considerably lower than previously
      reported by other countries. However, incidence rates increased gradually over
      time, with a clear female predominance.

TI  - Prebiotics and probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel
      disease in children.
PG  - 209-17
LID - 10.3920/BM2014.0067 [doi]
AB  - Underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a
      common disorder characterized by abdominal pain associated to a change in stool
      consistency or frequency, include low-grade inflammation and intestinal
      microbiota changes. Few and disappointing data are available for prebiotics. A
      few controlled trials (RCTs) of probiotics are instead available with favourable 
      effects, although most are limited by suboptimal design and small sample size. A 
      recent report from the Rome foundation group included 32 RCTs of probiotics, most
      of which showed an overall modest improvement in symptoms, with the patients most
      benefitting from probiotics being those with predominant diarrhoea and those
      having a post-infectious IBS. A review focusing only on children with functional 
      gastrointestinal disorders concluded that probiotics are more effective than
      placebo in the treatment of patients with abdominal pain-related functional
      gastrointestinal disorders, although no effect on constipation was evident. The
      role for probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) appears logical: the
      endogenous intestinal microbiota plays a central role in their development, and
      various probiotics have been found effective in animal models of IBD. However,
      research in humans has been overall quite limited, and it would seem that after a
      phase of intense research in the first decade of this century, the pace has
      slowed down, with fewer clinical trials been published in the past 2-3 years. To 
      summarize current evidence: no probiotic has proven successful in Crohn's
      disease. In ulcerative colitis, on the other hand, data are more promising, and a
      very recent meta-analysis, that included 23 randomized controlled trials,
      concluded that there is evidence of efficacy for the probiotic mixture VSL#3 in
      helping inducing and maintaining remission, as well as in maintaining remission
      in patients with pouchitis. It is fair to state that for both IBD and IBS, more
      well-designed, rigorous, randomized clinical trials must be performed.

PG  - 99-102
LID - 10.3109/15513815.2014.970262 [doi]
AB  - Celiac disease (CD) and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are separately
      well-described entities, but the co-occurrence in children has been very rarely
      reported until today. According to the literature, this case about 12-year-old
      girl would be the fifth case ever published about co-occurrence in children. We
      presume that there should be a higher comorbidity prevalence than that described.
      Distinguishing both diseases in one patient could be difficult due to the
      overlapping symptoms, but it is very important considering completely different
      therapeutic approaches.

TI  - S-Adenosylmethionine and methylthioadenosine inhibit beta-catenin signaling by
      multiple mechanisms in liver and colon cancer.
PG  - 77-86
LID - 10.1124/mol.114.095679 [doi]
AB  - S-Adenosylmethionine (SAMe), the principal methyl donor that is available as a
      nutritional supplement, and its metabolite methylthioadenosine (MTA) exert
      chemopreventive properties against liver and colon cancer in experimental models.
      Both agents reduced beta-catenin expression on immunohistochemistry in a murine
      colitis-associated colon cancer model. In this study, we examined the molecular
      mechanisms involved. SAMe or MTA treatment in the colitis-associated cancer model
      lowered total beta-catenin protein levels by 47 and 78%, respectively. In an
      orthotopic liver cancer model, increasing SAMe levels by overexpressing
      methionine adenosyltransferase 1A also reduced total beta-catenin levels by 68%. 
      In both cases, lower cyclin D1 and c-Myc expression correlated with lower
      beta-catenin levels. In liver (HepG2) and colon (SW480, HCT116) cancer cells with
      constitutively active beta-catenin signaling, SAMe and MTA treatment inhibited
      beta-catenin activity by excluding it from the nuclear compartment. However, in
      liver (Huh-7) and colon (RKO) cancer cells expressing wild-type Wnt/beta-catenin,
      SAMe and MTA accelerated beta-catenin degradation by a glycogen synthase kinase
      3-beta-dependent mechanism. Both agents lowered protein kinase B activity, but
      this was not mediated by inhibiting phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Instead, both
      agents increased the activity of protein phosphatase 2A, which inactivates
      protein kinase B. The effect of MTA on lowering beta-catenin is direct and not
      mediated by its conversion to SAMe, as blocking this conversion had no influence.
      In conclusion, SAMe and MTA inhibit Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in colon and liver
      cancer cells regardless of whether this pathway is aberrantly induced, making
      them ideal candidates for chemoprevention and/or chemotherapy in these cancers.

TI  - Gut microbiome and nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases.
PG  - 245-51
LID - 10.1038/pr.2014.157 [doi]
AB  - We review recent findings and hypotheses on the roles of gut microbiome in the
      pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD). Microbial metabolites 
      and cell components contribute to the development of hepatic steatosis and
      inflammation, key components of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the severe
      form of NAFLD. Altered gut microbiome can independently cause obesity, the most
      important risk factor for NAFLD. This capability is attributed to short-chain
      fatty acids (SCFAs), major gut microbial fermentation products. SCFAs account for
      a large portion of caloric intake of the host, and they enhance intestinal
      absorption by activating GLP-2 signaling. However, elevated SCFAs may be an
      adaptive measure to suppress colitis, which could be a higher priority than
      imbalanced calorie intake. The microbiome of NASH patients features an elevated
      capacity for alcohol production. The pathomechanisms for alcoholic
      steatohepatitis may apply to NASH. NAFLD/NASH is associated with elevated
      Gram-negative microbiome and endotoxemia. However, many NASH patients exhibited
      normal serum endotoxin indicating that endotoxemia is not required for the
      pathogenesis of NASH. These observations suggest that microbial intervention may 
      benefit NAFLD/NASH patients. However, very limited effects were observed using
      traditional probiotic species. Novel probiotic therapy based on NAFLD/NASH
      specific microbial composition represents a promising future direction.

TI  - Adalimumab therapy in children with Crohn disease previously treated with
      infliximab.
PG  - 205-10
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000589 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Adalimumab, a humanised anti-tumour necrosis factor antibody, is an
      effective treatment in adult patients with refractory Crohn disease (CD). The
      available literature on its efficacy in children remains limited. We aimed to
      evaluate the real-world efficacy in paediatric patients with CD and compare the
      efficacy between infliximab (IFX) nonresponders and patients who lost response to
      IFX. METHODS: All Dutch patients with CD receiving adalimumab before the age of
      18 years after previous IFX therapy were identified. We analysed longitudinal
      disease activity, assessed by the mathematically weighted Pediatric Crohn's
      Disease Activity Index (wPCDAI) or the physician global assessment (PGA), and
      adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: Fifty-three patients with CD were included. Twelve
      patients received monotherapy and the others received combination treatment with 
      thiopurines (n = 21), methotrexate (n = 11), steroids (n = 7), or exclusive
      enteral nutrition (n = 2). Median follow-up was 12 months (interquartile range
      5-23). Remission was reached in 34 patients (64%, wPCDAI < 12.5 or PGA = 0) after
      a median of 3.3 months, and maintained by 50% for 2 years. Eleven patients (21%) 
      reached response but not remission (decrease in wPCDAI >/= 17.5 or decrease in
      PGA). Eighteen patients (34%) failed adalimumab treatment because of nonresponse 
      (n = 4), lost response (n = 11), or AEs (n = 3). More IFX nonresponders failed
      adalimumab treatment than patients who lost response to IFX (2/3 vs 8/34, hazard 
      ratio 18.8, 95% confidence interval 1.1-303.6). Only 1 patient encountered a
      serious AE, a severe but nonfatal infection. CONCLUSIONS: In clinical practice,
      adalimumab induces remission in two-thirds of children with IFX refractory CD.

      patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 465-70
LID - 10.1007/s10620-014-3375-0 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recent research suggests a relationship of inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) and depression. Our objective was to evaluate for improvement of
      depressive symptoms with treatment of IBD using immunosuppressive medications.
      METHODS: A retrospective study of consecutive patients with IBD started on
      immunosuppressive agents [anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) or
      immunomodulator therapy] was conducted. Patients were evaluated if disease
      activity indices using Harvey Bradshaw Index for Crohn's disease (CD) and Simple 
      Clinical Colitis Disease Activity Index for ulcerative colitis (UC) and
      depressive indices using Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores were
      obtained before and at least 30 days after initiation of therapy. RESULTS:
      Sixteen patients with UC and 53 patients with CD (all with active disease
      symptoms) were evaluated over a 60 day median follow-up evaluation (range 30, 140
      days). Twenty-two patients started on immunomodulator therapy, and 47 patients
      started on anti-TNF therapy. Crohn's disease patients had significantly decreased
      PHQ-9 scores at follow-up [median 9 (range 3, 14) to 4 (1, 8)], with significant 
      decreases only in those started on anti-TNF therapy. Changes in PHQ-9 and CRP
      were correlated (rho = 0.38, p < 0.05). In patients with UC, PHQ-9 scores [5 (3, 
      9) to 2 (0, 5)] were significantly decreased. Percentage at risk of moderate to
      severe depression (PHQ-9 scores >/=10) was lower after treatment [Crohn's disease
      51-18 % (p < 0.05), ulcerative colitis 18-0 %]. CONCLUSION: Depressive scores
      decreased significantly in patients with IBD treated with immunosuppressive
      therapy and the number at risk for moderate to severe depression improved
      significantly.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in pediatric
      patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) and organic
      gastrointestinal (GI) diseases with an age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-matched
      healthy sample across GI diagnostic groups and with one another. STUDY DESIGN:
      The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 Generic Core Scales were completed in
      a 9-site study by 689 families. Patients had 1 of 7 physician-diagnosed GI
      disorders: chronic constipation, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel
      syndrome, functional dyspepsia, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and
      gastroesophageal reflux disease. The healthy control sample included 1114
      families. School days missed, days in bed and needing care, parent missed
      workdays, work impact, and healthcare utilization were compared as well. RESULTS:
      Patients with an FGID or organic GI disease demonstrated lower HRQOL than the
      healthy controls across all dimensions (physical, emotional, social, and school; 
      P < .001 for all), with larger effect sizes for patients with an FGID. Patients
      with an FGID manifested lower HRQOL than those with an organic GI disease.
      Patients with an FGID or organic GI disease missed more school, spent more days
      in bed and needing care, had greater healthcare utilization, and had parents who 
      missed more workdays with greater work impact (P < .001 for most), with larger
      effect sizes for the patients with an FGID. CONCLUSION: Patients with an FGID or 
      organic GI disease demonstrate impaired HRQOL compared with healthy children.
      HRQOL can be used as a common metric to compare patient outcomes in clinical
      research and practice both within and across groups of patients with FGIDs and
      organic GI diseases.

TI  - Feasibility and validity of the pediatric ulcerative colitis activity index in
      routine clinical practice.
PG  - 200-4
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000568 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) is a
      noninvasive disease activity index developed as a clinical trial endpoint. More
      recently, practice guidelines have recommended the use of PUCAI in routine
      clinical care. We therefore sought to evaluate the feasibility, validity, and
      responsiveness of PUCAI in a large, diverse collection of pediatric
      gastroenterology practices. METHODS: We extracted data from the 2 most recent
      encounters for patients with ulcerative colitis in the ImproveCareNow registry.
      Feasibility was determined by the percentage of patients for whom all PUCAI
      components were recorded, validity by correlation of PUCAI scores across
      physician global assessment (PGA) categories, and responsiveness to change by the
      correlation between the change in PUCAI and PGA scores between visits. RESULTS: A
      total of 2503 patients were included (49.5% boys, age 15.2 +/- 4.1 years, disease
      duration 3.7 +/- 3.2 years). All items in the PUCAI were completed for 96% of
      visits. PUCAI demonstrated excellent discriminatory ability between remission,
      mild, and moderate disease; discrimination between moderate and severe disease
      was less robust. There was good correlation with PGA (r = 0.76 [P < 0.001] and
      weighted kappa kappa = 0.73 [P < 0.001]). The PUCAI change scores correlated well
      with PGA change scores (P < 0.001). Test-retest reliability of the PUCAI was good
      (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.72 [95% confidence interval 0.70-0.75], P <
      0.001). Guyatt responsiveness statistic was 1.18, and the correlation of
      DeltaPUCAI with DeltaPGA was 0.69 (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The PUCAI is feasible
      to use in routine clinical settings. Evidence of its validity and responsiveness 
      supports its use as a clinical tool for monitoring disease activity for patients 
      with ulcerative colitis.

AB  - Chlorogenic acid (CHA) is an antioxidant polyphenol prevalent in human diet, with
      coffee, fruits, and vegetables being its main source. Effects of CHA and CHA
      metabolites were evaluated on the IL-8 production in human intestinal Caco-2
      cells induced by combined stimulation with tumour necrosis factor alpha
      (TNFalpha) and H2O2. CHA and caffeic acid (CA) inhibited TNFalpha- and
      H2O2-induced IL-8 production. We also examined the in vivo effects of CHA and CA 
      using dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. CHA attenuated
      DSS-induced body weight loss, diarrhea, fecal blood, and shortening of colon and 
      dramatically improved colitis histological scores. Furthermore, increases in the 
      mRNA expression of colonic macrophage inflammatory protein 2 and IL-1beta, which 
      were induced by DSS, were significantly suppressed by CHA supplementation. These 
      results suggest that dietary CHA use may aid in the prevention of intestinal
      inflammatory conditions.

TI  - Calorie intake of enteral nutrition and clinical outcomes in acutely critically
      ill patients: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
PG  - 291-300
LID - 10.1177/0148607114544322 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The appropriate calorie intake to be provided to critically ill
      patients via enteral nutrition (EN) remains unclear. We performed a meta-analysis
      of randomized controlled trials to compare the effect of initial underfeeding and
      full feeding in acutely critically ill patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We
      searched the Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 
      databases to identify randomized controlled trials that compared underfeeding
      with full feeding in critically ill patients. The primary outcome was overall
      mortality. The secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay, length of
      intensive care unit (ICU) stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, incidence of 
      pneumonia, Clostridium difficile colitis, other infectious complications, and
      gastrointestinal intolerance. RESULTS: In total, 4 studies were included in this 
      meta-analysis. There was no significant difference in overall mortality between
      the underfeeding and full-feeding groups (odds ratio [OR], 0.94; 95% confidence
      interval [CI], 0.74-1.19; I (2) = 26.6%; P = .61). Subgroup analysis of the
      underfeeding subgroup that was fed >/=33.3% of the standard caloric requirement
      indicated that overall mortality was significantly lower in this underfeeding
      subgroup than in the full-feeding group (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.40-1.00; I (2) = 0%;
      P = .05). In contrast, no difference in overall mortality was noted between the
      underfeeding subgroup that was fed <33.3% of the standard caloric requirement and
      the full-feeding group. The length of hospital stay and length of ICU stay did
      not differ between the 2 groups. Moreover, no differences in other secondary
      clinical outcomes were noted. CONCLUSIONS: None of the analyzed clinical outcomes
      for the acutely critically ill patients were significantly influenced by the
      calorie intake of the initial EN.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: There is controversy about whether levels of anti-tumor
      necrosis factor (TNF) and antidrug antibodies (ADAs) are accurate determinants of
      loss of response to therapy. We analyzed the association between trough levels of
      anti-TNF agents or ADAs and outcomes of interventions for patients with loss of
      response to infliximab or adalimumab. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study
      of pediatric and adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease and suspected
      loss of response to anti-TNF agents treated at medical centers throughout Israel 
      from October 2009 through February 2013. We examined the correlation between
      outcomes of different interventions and trough levels of drug or ADAs during loss
      of response. An additional subanalysis was performed including only patients with
      a definite inflammatory loss of response (clinical worsening associated with
      increased levels of C-reactive protein or fecal calprotectin, or detection of
      inflammation by endoscopy, fistula discharge, or imaging studies). RESULTS: Among
      247 patients (42 with ulcerative colitis), there were 330 loss-of-response events
      (188 to infliximab and 142 to adalimumab). Trough levels of adalimumab greater
      than 4.5 mcg/mL and infliximab greater than 3.8 mcg/mL identified patients who
      failed to respond to an increase in drug dosage or a switch to another anti-TNF
      agent with 90% specificity; these were set as adequate trough levels. Adequate
      trough levels identified patients who responded to expectant management or
      out-of-class interventions with more than 75% specificity. Levels of antibodies
      against adalimumab >4 microgram per mL equivalent (mcg/mL-eq) or antibodies
      against infliximab >9 mcg/mL-eq identified patients who did not respond to an
      increased drug dosage with 90% specificity. Patients with high titers of ADAs had
      longer durations of response when anti-TNF agents were switched than when dosage 
      was increased (P = .03; log-rank test), although dosage increases were more
      effective for patients with no or low titers of ADAs (P = .02). An analysis of
      definite inflammatory loss-of-response events (n = 244) produced similar results;
      patients with adequate trough levels had a longer duration of response when they 
      switched to a different class of agent than when anti-TNF was optimized by either
      a dosage increase or by a switch within the anti-TNF class (P = .002; log-rank
      test). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this retrospective analysis suggest that
      trough levels of drug or ADAs may guide therapeutic decisions for more than
      two-thirds of inflammatory bowel disease patients with either clinically
      suspected or definite inflammatory loss of response to therapy.

AB  - In ulcerative colitis (UC) the butyrate metabolism is impaired, leading to
      energy-deficiency in the colonic cells. The effect of inflammation on the
      butyrate metabolism was investigated. HT-29 cells were incubated with
      pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and/or IFN-gamma) for 1 and 24 h. Cells
      were additionally stimulated with butyrate to investigate its anti-inflammatory
      potential. Butyrate uptake and oxidation were measured using (14)C-labeled
      butyrate. Gene expression of the butyrate metabolism enzymes, interleukin 8
      (IL-8; inflammatory marker) and villin-1 (VIL-1; epithelial cell damage marker)
      was measured via quantitative RT-PCR. Significantly increased IL-8 expression and
      decreased VIL-1 expression after 24 h incubation with TNF-alpha and/or IFN-gamma 
      confirmed the presence of inflammation. These conditions induced a decrease of
      both butyrate uptake and oxidation, whereas the gene expression was not reduced. 
      Simultaneous incubation with butyrate counteracted the reduced butyrate
      oxidation. In contrast, 1 h incubation with TNF-alpha induced a significant
      increased IL-8 expression and decreased butyrate uptake. Incubation with
      TNF-alpha and/or IFN-gamma for 1 h did not induce cell damage nor influence
      butyrate oxidation. The inflammation-induced downregulation of the butyrate
      metabolism was not caused by a reduced gene expression, but appeared
      consequential to a decreased butyrate uptake. Increasing the luminal butyrate
      levels might have therapeutic potential in UC.

TI  - Intestinal steroidogenesis controls PPARgamma expression in the colon and is
      impaired during ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 901-10
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2014-307618 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Immune tolerance breakdown during UC involves the peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma), a key factor in mucosal
      homoeostasis and the therapeutic target of 5-aminosalycilates, which expression
      is impaired during UC. Here we assess the impact of glucocorticoids (GCs) on
      PPARgamma expression, focusing especially on extra-adrenal cortisol production by
      colonic epithelial cells (CECs). METHODS: Activation of PPARgamma in the colon
      was evaluated using transgenic mice for the luciferase gene under PPAR control
      (peroxisome proliferator response element-luciferase mice). Protein and mRNA
      expression of PPARgamma were evaluated with colon fragments and purified CEC from
      mice. Cortisol production and steroidogenic factor expression were quantified in 
      human CEC of patients with UC and those of controls. Gene expression knockdown by
      short hairpin RNA in Caco-2 cells was used for functional studies. RESULTS: GCs
      were able to raise luciferase activity in peroxisome proliferator response
      element-luciferase mice. In the mice colons and Caco-2 cells, PPARgamma
      expression was increased either with GCs or with an inducer of steroidogenesis
      and then decreased after treatment with a steroidogenesis inhibitor. Cortisol
      production and steroidogenic factor expression, such as liver receptor
      homologue-1 (LRH-1), were decreased in CEC isolated from patients with UC,
      directly correlating with PPARgamma impairment. Experiments on Caco-2 cells
      lacking LRH-1 expression confirmed that LRH-1 controls PPARgamma expression by
      regulating GC synthesis in CEC. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate cortisol
      control of PPARgamma expression in CEC, highlighting cortisol production
      deficiency in colonocytes as a key molecular event in the pathophysiology of UC.

PG  - 266-70
LID - 10.1111/jpc.12685 [doi]
AB  - Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), the two main types of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), have become increasingly common in Australasian
      children and adolescents in recent years. Furthermore, CD and UC are seen more
      often in younger children. These conditions are typically more extensive in
      children and tend to follow more severe disease courses than in adults. Although 
      many children may present with typical symptoms (such as abdominal pain or bloody
      diarrhoea), others have atypical features (including oral ulceration, short
      stature or skin manifestations). In addition, many children with IBD will have
      altered growth or nutrition, which may compromise normal linear growth and
      pubertal development. Early identification and full assessment of children
      presenting with possible IBD are essential to avoid consequences of diagnostic
      delay and to optimise short- and long-term outcomes. Management of IBD
      encompasses various options and should be undertaken within a team-based, child
      and family-focused, multidisciplinary setting.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Data to support treatment algorithms in ambulatory paediatric UC are
      scarce. We aimed to explore the 1 year outcome in an inception cohort of
      paediatric UC patients and to identify early predictors of good outcome that
      might serve as short term treatment targets. DESIGN: A chart review of 115
      children with new onset UC was performed (age 11 +/- 4.1 years; 58 (50%) males;
      86 (75%) extensive colitis; 70 (61%) moderate-severe disease; 63 (55%) received
      steroids at baseline). We assessed the Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity
      Index (PUCAI) and laboratory variables at the time of diagnosis and at 3 months, 
      and endoscopy at diagnosis. RESULTS: The 3 month PUCAI was the strongest
      predictor of 1 year sustained steroid free remission (SSFR) (area under the
      receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC)=0.7 (95% CI 0.6 to 0.8) and
      colectomy by 2 years (AUROC=0.75 (0.6 to 0.89)). SSFR was achieved in 9/54 (17%) 
      children who had active disease (PUCAI >/= 10) at 3 months (negative predictive
      value (NPV)=83%) and by 4/46 (8.6%) of those with a PUCAI score >10; (NPV=91%,
      positive predictive value=52%; p<0.001), implying that PUCAI >10 at 3 months has 
      a probability of 9% for achieving SSFR versus 48% with a PUCAI value of </=10.
      None of the variables at baseline was predictive of SSFR or colectomy (endoscopic
      severity, disease extent, age, PUCAI or C reactive protein/erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate/albumin/haemoglobin; all AUROC<0.6, p>0.05) but baseline PUCAI
      predicted subsequent acute severe colitis and the need for salvage medical
      therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Completeness of the early response appears more important
      than baseline UC severity for predicting outcome in children, and supports using 
      PUCAI<10 as a feasible treatment goal. Our data suggest that treatment escalation
      should be considered with a PUCAI value of >/= 10 at 3 months.

TI  - Outcome measures for clinical trials in paediatric IBD: an evidence-based,
      expert-driven practical statement paper of the paediatric ECCO committee.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although paediatric-onset IBD is becoming more common, few medications
      have a registered paediatric indication. There are multiple hurdles to performing
      clinical trials in children, emphasising the importance of choosing an
      appropriate outcome measure, which can facilitate enrolment, and thereby also
      drug approval. The aim of this consensus statement is to highlight paediatric
      specific issues and key factors critical for the optimal conduct of paediatric
      IBD trials. DESIGN: The Paediatric European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation
      (ECCO) committee has established an international expert panel to determine the
      best outcome measures in paediatric IBD, following a literature search and a
      modified Delphi process. All recommendations were endorsed by at least 80%
      agreement. RESULTS: Recognising the importance of mucosal healing (MH), the panel
      defined steroid-free MH as primary outcome measure for all drugs of new category 
      with one or two postintervention endoscopies per trial (at 8-12 weeks and/or 54
      weeks). Since endoscopic evaluation is a barrier for recruitment in children,
      trials with medications already shown to induce MH in children or adults, could
      use paediatric-specific disease activity scores as primary outcome, including a
      modified Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index in Crohn's disease and the
      Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index in UC. Secondary outcomes should
      include safety issues, MR enterography-based damage and inflammatory scores (in
      Crohn's disease), faecal calprotectin, quality of life scales, and a
      patient-reported outcome. CONCLUSIONS: It is crucial to perform paediatric trials
      early in the development of new drugs in order to reduce off-label use of IBD
      medication in children. The thoughtful choice of feasible and standardised
      outcome measures can help move us towards this goal.

TI  - Faecal metabolite profiling identifies medium-chain fatty acids as discriminating
      compounds in IBD.
PG  - 447-58
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2013-306423 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteria play a role in the onset and perpetuation of intestinal
      inflammation in IBD. Compositional alterations may also change the metabolic
      capacities of the gut bacteria. OBJECTIVE: To examine the metabolic activity of
      the microbiota of patients with Crohn's disease (CD), UC or pouchitis compared
      with healthy controls (HC) and determine whether eventual differences might be
      related to the pathogenesis of the disease. METHODS: Faecal samples were obtained
      from 40 HC, 83 patients with CD, 68 with UC and 13 with pouchitis. Disease
      activity was assessed in CD using the Harvey-Bradshaw Index, in UC using the UC
      Disease Activity Index and in pouchitis using the Pouchitis Disease Activity
      Index. Metabolite profiles were analysed using gas chromatography-mass
      spectrometry. RESULTS: The number of metabolites identified in HC (54) was
      significantly higher than in patients with CD (44, p<0.001), UC (47, p=0.042) and
      pouchitis (43, p=0.036). Multivariate discriminant analysis predicted HC, CD, UC 
      and pouchitis group membership with high sensitivity and specificity. The levels 
      of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs: pentanoate, hexanoate, heptanoate, octanoate 
      and nonanoate), and of some protein fermentation metabolites, were significantly 
      decreased in patients with CD, UC and pouchitis. Hexanoate levels were inversely 
      correlated to disease activity in CD (correlation coefficient=-0.157, p=0.046),
      whereas a significant positive correlation was found between styrene levels and
      disease activity in UC (correlation coefficient=0.338, p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS:
      Faecal metabolic profiling in patients with IBD relative to healthy controls
      identified MCFAs as important metabolic biomarkers of disease-related changes.

TI  - Immunological alteration and changes of gut microbiota after dextran sulfate
      sodium (DSS) administration in mice.
PG  - 107-20
LID - 10.1007/s10238-013-0270-5 [doi]
AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) is characterized by chronic inflammation of the colonic
      mucosa. Administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to animals is a frequently
      used model to mimic human colitis. Deregulation of the immune response to the
      enteric microflora or pathogens as well as increased intestinal permeability have
      been proposed as disease-driving mechanisms. To enlarge the understanding of the 
      pathogenesis, we have studied the effect of DSS on the immune system and gut
      microbiota in mice. Intestinal inflammation was verified through histological
      evaluation and myeloperoxidase activity. Immunological changes were assessed by
      flow cytometry in spleen, Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes and through 
      multiplex cytokine profiling. In addition, quantification of the total amount of 
      bacteria on colonic mucosa as well as the total amount of lactobacilli,
      Akkermansia, Desulfovibrio and Enterobacteriaceae was performed by the use of
      quantitative PCR. Diversity and community structure were analysed by terminal
      restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) patterns, and principal
      component analysis was utilized on immunological and T-RFLP patterns. DSS-induced
      colitis show clinical and histological similarities to UC. The composition of the
      colonic microflora was profoundly changed and correlated with several alterations
      of the immune system. The results demonstrate a relationship between multiple
      immunological changes and alterations of the gut microbiota after DSS
      administration. These data highlight and improve the definition of the
      immunological basis of the disease and suggest a role for dysregulation of the
      gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of colitis.
