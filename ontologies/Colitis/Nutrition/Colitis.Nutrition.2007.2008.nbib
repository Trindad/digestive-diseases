TI  - Crohn's disease phenotype, prognosis, and long-term complications: what to
      expect?
PG  - 303-7
AB  - According to Montreal classification, different phenotypes of Crohn's disease are
      defined taking into account age at diagnosis, localization of digestive lesions
      at first surgery, and cumulative anatomical behaviour. This classification is
      supported by the increased severity of the disease when diagnosed in childhood,
      the relative stability of disease localization over time, and the clinical
      importance of intestinal complications as stricture and abscess or fistula
      formation. However, type and delay of complications are dependent on disease
      localization (they develop early in small bowel disease and late in colitis),
      every patient will develop complications one day, and perianal disease may be an 
      important problem observed in up to half the patients. The percentage of patients
      with active disease every year remains stable, about 40%, after the 3 first
      years, and only a few patients have long periods of remission. Intestinal
      resections are required in the majority of patients during life, and many are
      operated on several times. Prognosis is hampered by iterative surgery, cancer and
      side-effects of treatment. Standardized mortality ratio is 1.50. Although
      occurrence of complications, need for surgery and mortality did not change
      significantly through the years 1950-2000, there are some signals suggesting that
      new therapetic strategies (immunosuppressants earlier in high risk patients) and 
      biologics will modify natural history and improve the long-term prognosis.

TI  - Mercaptopurine treatment should be considered in azathioprine intolerant patients
      with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 654-61

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adverse drug reactions are a significant reason for therapeutic
      failure during thiopurine treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. Some smaller
      series in this patient population have shown that a switch to mercaptopurine may 
      be successful in many cases of azathioprine intolerance. AIM: To assess the
      long-term outcome of mercaptopurine treatment in a large patient population with 
      azathioprine intolerance. METHODS: We identified 135 patients (74 women; median
      age 40 years) with Crohn's disease (n = 88) or ulcerative colitis (n = 47) and
      reviewed their medical records. RESULTS: A total of 70 patients (52%) tolerated
      mercaptopurine and were followed up for 736 (362-1080) days; 65 patients
      discontinued mercaptopurine due to adverse events after 25 (8-92) days.
      Mercaptopurine was tolerated in 71% (12/17) with hepatotoxicity and in 68%
      (13/19) with arthralgia/myalgia during azathioprine treatment. Previous abdominal
      surgery was more common in mercaptopurine intolerant patients [39/65 (60%) vs.
      27/70 (39%); P = 0.02] and thiopurine methyltransferase activity was higher in
      mercaptopurine tolerant patients than in mercaptopurine intolerant patients [13.2
      (11.4-15.3) vs. 11.8 (9.6-14.2) U/mL red blood cells; P = 0.04; n = 81].
      CONCLUSIONS: A trial of mercaptopurine should be considered in azathioprine
      intolerance, as half of the patients tolerate a switch to mercaptopurine.
      Patients with hepatotoxicity or arthralgia/myalgia during azathioprine treatment 
      might benefit more often than those with other types of adverse events.

TI  - [Nutritional management of inflammatory bowel disease].
PG  - 418-28
AB  - Patients with inflammatory bowel disease present higher risk for hyponutrition.
      For this reason, an adequate nutritional support is frequently needed. In these
      patients, enteral nutrition should be used unless there exist contraindications. 
      Nutritional support as the primary therapy is no indicated in adults (since
      steroidal therapy has shown to be more effective) but in the case of intolerance 
      or lack of response to medical treatment. By contrast, enteral nutrition is
      considered a first line therapy in children. There is no clear benefit with the
      use of specific formulas (modified fat, glutamine...), so that their routine use 
      is not recommended. In spite of the great technical and scientific advances,
      there are still many fields in which knowledge should be broaden; some of them
      are pointed out in this publication.

TI  - Folate concentrations in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed inflammatory
      bowel disease.
PG  - 545-50
LID - 10.3945/ajcn.2008.26576 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Folate is postulated to protect against cell injury and long-term
      risk of cancer. Folate deficiency has been shown to be associated with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, folate concentrations are poorly
      delineated in children with IBD. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare folate
      concentrations between children with newly diagnosed IBD and healthy controls.
      DESIGN: Red blood cell folate (RBCF) and whole-blood folate (WBF) concentrations 
      were measured in 78 children (mean age: 12.8 +/- 2.7 y): 22 patients with newly
      diagnosed untreated Crohn disease, 11 patients with ulcerative colitis, 4
      patients with indeterminate colitis, and 41 controls. Vitamin supplementation and
      dietary intakes determined by food-frequency questionnaire were recorded for 20
      IBD patients and 28 controls. RESULTS: RBCF concentrations were 19.4% lower in
      controls (587.0 +/- 148.6 ng/mL) than in patients (728.7 +/- 185.8 ng/mL; P =
      0.0004), and WBF concentrations were 11.1% lower in controls (218.2 +/- 49.7
      ng/mL) than in patients (245.3 +/- 59.1 ng/mL; P = 0.031). Total folate intake
      was 18.8% higher in controls (444.7 +/- 266.7 microg/d) than in IBD patients
      (361.1 +/- 230.6 microg/d), but this difference was not statistically significant
      (P = 0.264). Folate intakes were below the Recommended Dietary Allowance (200-400
      microg/d), adjusted for age and sex, in 35.4% of study subjects. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      contrast with previous evidence of folate deficiency in adult IBD patients, our
      data indicate higher folate concentrations in children with newly diagnosed
      untreated IBD than in controls. This finding was unexpected, especially in light 
      of the higher dietary folate intakes and hematocrit values in children without
      IBD. The influence of IBD therapy on folate metabolism and the long-term clinical
      implications of high RBCF and WBF concentrations at the time of IBD diagnosis
      should be explored further.

TI  - Recent advances in the management of radiation colitis.
PG  - 7289-301
AB  - Radiation colitis, an insidious, progressive disease of increasing frequency,
      develops 6 mo to 5 years after regional radiotherapy for malignancy, owing to the
      deleterious effects of the latter on the colon and the small intestine. When
      dealing with radiation colitis and its complications, the most conservative
      modality should be employed because the areas of intestinal injury do not tend to
      heal. Acute radiation colitis is mostly self-limited, and usually, only
      supportive management is required. Chronic radiation colitis, a poorly
      predictable progressive disease, is considered as a precancerous lesion;
      radiation-associated malignancy has a tendency to be diagnosed at an advanced
      stage and to bear a dismal prognosis. Therefore, management of chronic radiation 
      colitis remains a major challenge owing to the progressive evolution of the
      disease, including development of fibrosis, endarteritis, edema, fragility,
      perforation, partial obstruction, and cancer. Patients are commonly managed
      conservatively. Surgical intervention is difficult to perform because of the
      extension of fibrosis and alterations in the gut and mesentery, and should be
      reserved for intestinal obstruction, perforation, fistulas, and severe bleeding. 
      Owing to the difficulty in managing the complications of acute and chronic
      radiation colitis, particular attention should be focused onto the prevention
      strategies. Uncovering the fibrosis mechanisms and the molecular events
      underlying radiation bowel disease could lead to the introduction of new
      therapeutic and/or preventive approaches. A variety of novel, mostly
      experimental, agents have been used mainly as a prophylaxis, and improvements
      have been made in radiotherapy delivery, including techniques to reduce the
      amount of exposed intestine in the radiation field, as a critical strategy for
      prevention.

      patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 239-44
LID - 10.1016/j.nutres.2008.02.005 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn
      disease (CD), is a disorder characterized by diffuse inflammation of the
      gastrointestinal tract. The immune response and inflammation are mediated by
      polyunsaturated fatty acids and influenced by dietary fats and lipid metabolism. 
      This study examined the qualitative and quantitative fat intake of IBD patients
      and healthy controls on plasma phospholipid and erythrocyte membrane phospholipid
      (EMP) fatty acid content. Measurement of the fatty acid composition of plasma
      phospholipid and EMP were performed in 29 UC patients, 20 CD patients, and 31
      healthy controls. Anthropometric characteristics and data on dietary intake were 
      also collected. We observed significantly lower lipid intake in UC and CD
      patients vs controls. The UC and CD patients had significantly higher levels of
      linoleic acid in their EMP than did controls. There were no significant
      differences in the levels of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, but there were
      significantly higher levels of the n-6 in the EMP of UC and CD patients compared 
      with controls. The significant differences persisted after the data were adjusted
      for potential confounders and lipid intake. Higher levels of linoleic acids and
      n-6 fatty acids, which are involved in production of proinflammatory mediators,
      were found in IBD patients compared with controls, thereby implicating n-6 fatty 
      acids in the pathophysiology of the disease.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease is one of the most prevalent chronic inflammatory
      disorders and commonly presents during childhood or adolescence. Occurring during
      a critical period of growth and development, pediatric Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis require special consideration. Children often experience
      growth failure, malnutrition, pubertal delay and bone demineralization. Medical
      treatment must be optimized to promote clinical improvement and reverse growth
      failure with minimal toxicity. In addition to pharmacologic and surgical
      interventions, nutritional therapies play a vital role in the management of
      pediatric inflammatory bowel disease. This review will outline the epidemiology
      and clinical complications that are unique to pediatric inflammatory bowel
      disease, current trends, and recent advances in nutritional and pharmacologic
      treatment, and projected future therapeutic direction.

TI  - How expensive is inflammatory bowel disease? A critical analysis.
PG  - 6641-7
AB  - Economic analysis of chronic diseases is required for proper allocation of
      resources and understanding cost-effectiveness studies of new therapies. Studies 
      on health care cost of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are
      reviewed here. These studies were carried out in various countries with disparate
      health care systems. In the United States, data were often modeled or retrieved
      from large insurance schemes. Surgery and in-patient hospitalization accounted
      for over half the outlay on UC and CD. Fistulous disease in CD and parenteral
      nutrition were very costly. In Canada, overall charges were lower than in the
      United States, but there too, surgical costs were relatively high. In European
      studies, economic data were abstracted directly from patients' files. One
      pan-European study examined the outlay on UC and CD in a community-based
      prospective inception cohort followed for 10 years. Overall costs in Europe were 
      lower than in the United States. Surgery, hospitalization, year of follow-up,
      disease phenotype in CD and ASCA-positivity impacted significantly on costs. In
      all studies, the cost data were right skewed, aminosalicylates were expensive
      drugs, and biological agents the most expensive; moreover indirect costs were not
      calculated. Infliximab raised costs considerably in CD, but there were no
      long-term follow-up studies, so that the cost-benefit of biological agents
      remains unknown. In conclusion, costs of managing UC and CD vary by country,
      surgery, genotype and several other factors. The most important question for
      further research is whether the biological therapies are cost-effective in the
      long-term.

TI  - The ErbB4 growth factor receptor is required for colon epithelial cell survival
      in the presence of TNF.
PG  - 217-26
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2008.09.023 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The ErbB4 receptor tyrosine kinase regulates cell growth,
      survival, and differentiation in several tissues, but its role in the
      gastrointestinal tract has not been reported. We tested the hypothesis that ErbB4
      promotes intestinal cell survival and restitution following injury or
      inflammation. METHODS: ErbB4 expression in human inflammatory bowel disease was
      determined by immunohistochemistry. Mice were subjected to dextran sulfate sodium
      (DSS, 3%) colitis or injected with tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and ErbB4
      expression was quantified by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Cultured
      young adult mouse colon (YAMC) cells were exposed to TNF, and ErbB4 messenger
      RNA, protein, and phosphorylation levels were measured. Cells transfected with
      ErbB4 small interfering RNA (siRNA), or over expressing ErbB4, were subjected to 
      wound healing and apoptosis assays. RESULTS: ErbB4 levels increased in Crohn's
      colitis and the colon epithelium of mice with DSS colitis or injected with TNF.
      In YAMC cells, TNF induced ErbB4 messenger RNA, protein, and phosphorylation;
      nuclear factor kappaB activation also stimulated ErbB4 accumulation. ErbB4 siRNA 
      sensitized cells to TNF-stimulated apoptosis, while over expression blocked
      apoptosis induced by TNF plus cycloheximide. Additionally, ErbB4 siRNA decreased 
      YAMC cell wound healing. ErbB4 knockdown attenuated, while over expression
      elevated, phosphorylation of Akt in response to TNF. Inhibition of the
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling cascade reversed the ability of ErbB4
      over expression to protect from cytokine-induced apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: ErbB4
      expression and signaling are key elements for TNF responses in vivo and in cell
      culture, protecting intestinal epithelial cells from apoptosis in the
      inflammatory environment, possibly through Akt activation.

TI  - Malnutrition in inflammatory bowel disease patients in northern India: frequency 
      and factors influencing its development.
PG  - 95-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are often under
      nourished. Though there are several studies evaluating nutrition in patients with
      IBD from the developed world, the data from developing countries are scanty,
      where under nutrition is predominant. METHOD: 62 patients with IBD (55 ulcerative
      colitis [UC] and 7 Crohn's disease [CD] patients) and 42 healthy subjects (HS)
      were evaluated for nutrition using dietary survey, anthropometric and biochemical
      parameters. RESULTS: Of the patients with IBD, 23 (37%) had active disease and 39
      (63%) were in remission. Daily intake of calories (1725 Kcal/d [500-2458] vs.
      2239 Kcal/d [1835-3000], p<0.0001), protein (40 g/d [19-96] vs. 50 g/d [29-73],
      p=0.001) and iron (9 mg/d [1-16] vs. 12 mg/d [9-16], p<0.0001) and anthropometric
      parameters of nutrition such as body mass index (BMI) (19.8 [13.7-27.5] vs. 23
      [17.9-27.2], <0.0001), biceps (0.3 mm [0.1-1.9] vs. 0.5 mm [0.2-1.0], p<0.0001)
      and triceps (0.7 mm [0.2-2.9] vs. 1.2 mm [0.5-2.3], p<0.0001) skin fold thickness
      (BSF, TSF) and mid-arm muscle circumference (MAMC, 25.9 mm [15-35] vs. 26.8 mm
      [23-32] <0.04) were lower among the IBD patients than among the HS. Though
      patients with CD had a lower level of haemoglobin (median 9.2 g vs. 10.8 g,
      respectively; p<0.05) and serum total protein (median 6 g, range 3-7 vs. 7 g,
      range 3-9, respectively; p<0.05), serum albumin, BMI, BSF and TSF thicknesses,
      MAMC and daily intake of protein, calories, calcium and iron were comparable
      between UC and CD patients. Though daily dietary intake was comparable between
      patients with active disease and those in remission yet patients with active
      disease had lower BMI, MAMC and serum protein level. CONCLUSION: Under nutrition 
      is common in patients with IBD, particularly in those with acute exacerbation.

TI  - Gastrointestinal complications of oncologic therapy.
PG  - 682-96
LID - 10.1038/ncpgasthep1277 [doi]
AB  - Gastrointestinal complications are common in patients undergoing various forms of
      cancer treatment, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and
      molecular-targeted therapies. Many of these complications are life-threatening
      and require prompt diagnosis and treatment. Complications of oncologic therapy
      can occur in the esophagus (esophagitis, strictures, bacterial, viral and fungal 
      infections), upper gastrointestinal tract (mucositis, bleeding, nausea and
      vomiting), colon (diarrhea, graft-versus-host disease, colitis and constipation),
      liver (drug hepatotoxicity and graft-versus-host disease), and pancreas
      (pancreatitis). Treatment of the different gastrointestinal complications should 
      be tailored to the individual patient and based on the underlying pathophysiology
      of the complication.

TI  - Circulating adipokines and the protective effects of hyperinsulinemia in
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 172-81
LID - 10.1016/j.nut.2008.07.020 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Adipokines are fat-derived hormones and cytokines with
      immune-modulating and metabolic properties. Most of them are associated with
      insulin resistance. The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate
      circulating levels of adipokines and glucose homeostasis in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and to evaluate possible associations with the
      course and characteristics of the disease. METHODS: Serum leptin, resistin,
      visfatin, retinol-binding protein-4, adiponectin, glucose, insulin, and
      inflammatory parameters were analyzed in 93 patients with inactive IBD (49 with
      Crohn's disease [CD], 44 with ulcerative colitis [UC]), 35 patients with active
      IBD (18 with CD, 17 with UC), and 37 age- and body mass index-matched healthy
      controls. Ninety-two patients were followed for 6 mo. RESULTS: Leptin was similar
      in patients with IBD and controls, whereas resistin and visfatin were increased
      in patients with active disease but not in those in remission. In active and
      inactive disease, adiponectin was decreased (P < 0.001) and retinol-binding
      protein-4 was increased (P < 0.001) compared with controls. About 60% of patients
      with IBD showed increased levels of insulin, whereas serum glucose remained
      normal, resulting in increased homeostasis model assessment values in most
      patients. Hyperinsulinemia was associated with the decrease in adiponectin (r =
      -0.572, P < 0.001) and proved to be an independent protective factor for 6-mo
      maintenance of remission (P = 0.016). CONCLUSION: IBD led to largely similar
      alterations in circulating adipokines and hyperinsulinemia in patients with CD
      and those with UC. The unexpected protective effect of hyperinsulinemia on
      relapse rate denotes the role of the metabolic-inflammatory response as a
      modulator in IBD.

TI  - Steroids and poor nutrition are associated with infectious wound complications in
      children undergoing first stage procedures for ulcerative colitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Risk factors for postoperative infections have not been evaluated in 
      pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). This review was undertaken to
      evaluate the effects of immunosuppressive therapy and other preoperative factors 
      on infectious wound complications in children undergoing first stage surgical
      therapy for UC. METHODS: A 10-year retrospective review of children under 18
      years of age receiving first stage surgical therapy for UC at a major children's 
      hospital was performed. Preoperative clinical and treatment variables were
      identified and correlated with postoperative wound complications. RESULTS: A
      total of 51 children were identified: 19 underwent colectomy with ileo-anal-pouch
      anastomosis and 32 underwent total abdominal colectomy with Hartmann's pouch. A
      total of 20 infectious complications were identified in 18 patients. Preoperative
      steroid use was associated with a greater postoperative wound infection rate.
      Preoperative hemoglobin less than 10 g/dL (P < .05) and albumin less than 3 g/dL 
      (P = 0.1) were associated with greater rates of postoperative infection.
      Preoperative body mass index and other immunosuppressive agents did not influence
      postoperative infectious morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of pediatric
      patients who require operative intervention for UC are debilitated from their
      disease and medication use. Children with normal serum albumin and hemoglobin who
      are not on steroid therapy have a low risk of postoperative infectious
      complications.

TI  - High prevalence of vitamin K and D deficiency and decreased BMD in inflammatory
      bowel disease.
PG  - 935-42
LID - 10.1007/s00198-008-0764-2 [doi]
AB  - SUMMARY: Vitamin K and D deficiency and decreased bone mineral density (BMD) were
      highly prevalent in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially
      Crohn's disease (CD). Dietary intakes of these vitamins, however, were above the 
      Japanese adequate intakes in IBD patients, suggesting that malabsorption is the
      basis for hypovitaminosis K and D and decreased BMD. INTRODUCTION: We have
      studied the possible involvement of vitamin K and D deficiency in the
      pathogenesis of decreased BMD in IBD. METHODS: Seventy patients with IBD were
      evaluated for their BMD; plasma levels of vitamin K; phylloquinone (PK),
      menaquinone-7 (MK-7), and 25OH-D; serum PTH, protein induced by vitamin K absence
      (PIVKA-II), and undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) levels; and their food
      intake. RESULTS: Compared with ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, CD patients had 
      significantly lower plasma vitamin K and 25OH-D concentrations; significantly
      higher serum levels of PTH, PIVKA-II, and ucOC; and significantly lower BMD
      scores at almost all measurement sites. More IBD patients were vitamin K
      deficient in bone than in liver. Multiple regression analyses revealed that low
      plasma concentrations of vitamin K and 25OH-D were independent risk factors for
      low BMD and that they were associated with the patients' fat intake, but not with
      their intake of these vitamins. CONCLUSION: IBD patients have high prevalence of 
      decreased BMD and vitamin K and D deficiency probably caused by malabsorption of 
      these vitamins.

      Peyer's patch in inflamed and normal ileum.
PG  - 374-8
LID - 10.1007/s00011-007-7216-x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Pigmented cells, that contain inert, submicron-sized dietary
      particles, are a consistent feature of the base of human Peyer's patches (PP). We
      aimed (i) to phenotype these intestinal pigment cells (PC) in archival tissue
      specimens and (ii) to establish whether PC phenotype is altered in inflammatory
      conditions, especially Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: PCs contained within PP
      were identified by routine haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and dark field
      microscopy of archival ileal sections for: adenocarcinoma (n=16), colonic CD
      (n=23), non-CD colitis (n=10). Paraffin-embedded serial sections were graded for 
      microscopic inflammation and then investigated immunohistochemically with
      antibodies against CD68, MAC387, CD14, CD11b, CD15, CD1a, S100, HLA-DR, CD86 and 
      Cathepsin D. Analyses were by light and confocal microscopies. RESULTS: The
      majority of PCs were CD68 positive (circa 80%) with a minority (circa 20%)
      staining for MAC387. Microparticles were mainly identified within cathepsin D
      negative lysosomal compartments. Histological inflammatory grade and disease type
      had no influence on cell phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: The microparticle-containing PCs
      of the PP base are mainly mature macrophages (CD68) of low metabolic and
      immunological activity. There is no evidence of differential PC phenotype or
      activation in differing disease states, including CD.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recognizing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is
      straightforward when alarm symptoms are present, such as bloody diarrhea and
      weight loss. When the presentation is subtle or atypical, physicians must
      determine which patients warrant evaluation for IBD. Appropriate use of
      noninvasive tests can help identify which patients should undergo further
      investigation. RECENT FINDINGS: Currently IBD serologies lack high enough
      sensitivity and specificity to make them useful as a screening test for
      distinguishing IBD from other disorders, but they may have a role in classifying 
      subtypes of IBD. Fecal markers seem promising for helping to differentiate IBD
      from irritable bowl syndrome and for monitoring disease activity.
      Pharmacogenetically guided dosing is recommended for safe use of thiopurines but 
      ongoing routine laboratory monitoring remains important. Thiopurine metabolite
      measurement can be useful but may not be needed in all cases. SUMMARY: Primary
      care physicians should continue to rely on routine laboratory tests and clinical 
      suspicion to decide which patients with abdominal pain to refer to a
      gastroenterologist. Serology panels are not useful for IBD screening as the
      results may lead to unnecessary procedures. Although fecal markers do show
      promise as a screening test for IBD, patient resistance to providing stool
      samples may limit its usefulness in disease monitoring. Thiopurine metabolite
      levels are best used in conjunction with clinical status and routine laboratory
      tests to monitor clinical response and adverse events.

      stability of shiga-like toxin 1.
PG  - 167-71
LID - 10.1016/j.mimet.2008.05.014 [doi]
AB  - Shiga toxins and Shiga-like toxins (Stx) are a relatively large group of
      cytotoxins produced by certain serotypes of Shigella and E. coli (STEC). These
      toxins are responsible for diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis and may induce hemolytic
      uremic syndrome (HUS) with serious consequences in young children. The toxins are
      proteins made up of 5 small B subunits responsible for binding to an outer
      membrane ligand on host cells and surround the larger, biologically active A
      subunit. For Shiga-like toxin 1 (Stx1), the cellular receptor is the carbohydrate
      globotriose. Stx1was purified from STEC. We utilized induction of apoptosis in
      the human monocyte cell line THP-1, as a biological endpoint to test the
      stability of Stx1 activity added to fruit punch at different pH (2-9) and
      temperatures (4 and 20 degrees C). A flow cytometric method was used to test for 
      early and late apoptotic events based on binding of R-phycoerytherin-labeled
      annexin V to exposed membrane phosphatidyl serine. Membrane permeability to
      7-Amino-actinomycin corresponds with late apoptosis or necrosis. The combination 
      of acid pH and higher storage temperature resulted in greatest degree of toxin
      inactivation. This approach provides a rapid and high throughput method to
      determine the functional activity of Stx1, and related toxins in a food matrix.

TI  - Perioperative treatment with infliximab in patients with Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis is not associated with an increased rate of postoperative
      complications.
PG  - 1730-6; discussion 1736-7
LID - 10.1007/s11605-008-0630-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The impact of infliximab (IFX) on postoperative complications in
      surgical patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) is
      unclear. We examined a large patient cohort to clarify whether a relationship
      exists between IFX and postoperative complications. METHODS: A total of 413
      consecutive patients--188 (45.5%) with suspected CD, 156 (37.8%) with UC, and 69 
      (16.7%) with indeterminate colitis--underwent abdominal surgery at the
      Massachusetts General Hospital between January 1993 and June 2007. One hundred
      one (24.5%) had received preoperative IFX < or = 12 weeks before surgery. These
      patients were compared to those who did not receive IFX with respect to
      demographics, comorbidities, presence of preoperative infections, steroid use,
      and nutritional status. We then compared the cumulative rate of complications for
      each group, which included deaths, anastomotic leak, infection, thrombotic
      complications, prolonged ileus/small bowel obstruction, cardiac, and hepatorenal 
      complications. Potential risk factors for infectious complications including
      preexisting infection, pathological diagnosis, and steroid or IFX exposure were
      further evaluated using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Patients were
      similar with respect to gender (IFX = 40.6% men vs. non-IFX = 51.9%, p = 0.06),
      age (36.1 years vs. 37.8, p = 0.43), Charlson Comorbidity Index (5.3 vs. 5.7, p =
      0.25), concomitant steroids (75.3% vs. 76.9%, p = 0.79), preoperative albumin
      level (3.3 vs. 3.2, p = 0.36), and rate of emergent surgery (3.0% vs. 3.5%, p =
      1.00). IFX patients had higher rates of CD (56.4% vs. 41.9%, p = 0.02),
      concomitant azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine use (34.6% vs. 16.6%, p < 0.0001), and 
      lower rates of intra-abdominal abscess (3.9% vs. 11%, p < 0.05). After surgery,
      the two groups had similar rates of death (2% vs. 0.3% p = 0.09), anastomotic
      leak (3.0% vs. 2.9%, p = 0.97), cumulative infections (5.97% vs. 10.1%, p = 1),
      thrombotic complications (3.6% vs. 3.0%, p = 0.06), prolonged ileus/small bowel
      obstructions (3.9 vs. 2.8, p = 0.59), cardiac complications (1% vs. 0.6%, p =
      0.42), and hepatic or renal complications (1.0 vs. 0.6% p = 0.72). A logistic
      regression model was then created to assess the impact of IFX, as well as other
      potential risk factors, on the rates of cumulative postoperative infections. We
      found that steroids (odds ratio [OR] = 1.2, p = 0.74), IFX (OR 2.5, p = 0.14),
      preoperative diagnosis of CD (OR = 0.7, p = 0.63) or UC (OR = 0.6, p = 0.48), and
      preoperative infection (OR = 1.2, p = 0.76) did not affect rates of clinically
      important postoperative infections. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative IFX was not
      associated with an increased rate of cumulative postoperative complications.

TI  - Total parenteral nutrition in treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 21-43
AB  - Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) are exposed to nutritional risk.
      Malnutrition in Crohn's Disease (CD) and to a somewhat lesser in Ulcerative
      Colitis (UC) is very frequent. Depending on the severity of the disease, weight
      loss has been reported in 65% to 76% of those with CD and in 18% to 62% of those 
      with UC. The role of Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) is essential in very severe
      cases where enteral nutrition is not tolerated or standard drug therapy is not
      effective. Nutritional therapy is important for the correction of nutritional
      deficiency, especially in cases where elective surgical treatment is required.
      This study examined the effects of preoperative TPN administration in patients
      with IBD. Since 1990, 29 pts, 13 (44.8%) male and 16 (55.2%) female with severe
      IBD; 16 (55.2%) with UC and 13 (44.8%) with CD were treated with TPN in our
      department in the preoperative period. Evaluation of this group was compared with
      a group which was not treated with TPN preoperatively: 61 pts, 34 (55.7%) male,
      27 (44.3%) female; 50 (82%) with CD, 11 (18%) with UC. Evaluation of this group
      was compared with the group of patients who were subjected to surgical procedure 
      without prior TPN administration, in total a number of 61, of whom 34 (55.7%)
      were male and 27 (44.3%) female patients. In this group, the number of patients
      with CD and UC was 50 (82%) and 11(18%) respectively. During the course of the
      study, the following parameters were examined: Body mass index (BMI), Disease
      Activity Index (CDAI/AI), laboratory parameters and the number of hospital days. 
      The parameters were analysed before the surgical intervention, and one week and
      six months after the surgical intervention. The duration of the application of
      TPN was 12.5 +/- 5 days. The analysis of these parameters has shown that there is
      no statistically significant difference in the number of hospital days in both
      groups, which was 18.9 +/- 8.9 in the intervention group and 18.9 +/- 6.5 days in
      the control group, p = 0.9808, but analysis of the Disease Activity (CDAI/AI) has
      shown that patients who were on TPN were in a more severe stage of the disease.
      In the TPN treated group of patients none, 0 pts (0%), of the pts had no Index of
      Activity, 1.7 pts (24.1%) had Index 2 and 22 (75.9%) had Index 3. In the other
      group 3 pts (4.9%) had Index 1; 39 pts (63.9%) had Index 2 and 19 pts (31.2%) had
      Index of Activity 3. During the monitoring period of six months the activity of
      the disease was lower in patients treated with TPN. The BMI in the group of
      patients treated with TPN was lower in both sexes. It was lower than 18.4 in 7
      males and 5 females; between 18.4 and 19.9 in 2 males and 4 females; between 19.9
      and 25 in 3 males and 6 females; between 25 and 19.9 in 1 male and 1 female;
      there were no pts with BMI higher than 29.9. In the control non-TPN group, 5
      males and 3 females had BMI < or = 18.4; 2 males and 5 females had between 18.4
      and 19.9; 23 males and 13 females had between 19.9 and 25; 3 males and 5 females 
      had between 25 and 29.9 and 1 male and 1 female had BMI higher than 29.9. The BMI
      had an increasing trend in the postoperative period in both groups. The
      laboratory parameters that we examined were: number of erythrocytes and
      sedimentation, number of leukocytes, haemoglobin levels, total number of
      lymphocytes, albumin level, C-reactive protein, orosomucoid, electrolytes;
      sodium, potassium, calcium and serum iron, the enzymes (AP, AST and ALT); level
      of bilirubin and urea and creatinine. The results were analysed using the Tukey
      honest significant difference test (HSD), ANOVA and Student t-test. Statistically
      significant differences were observed between preoperative and postoperative
      period in both groups. The intergroup comparison showed significant differences
      in the level of albumin, AST, ALT and bilirubin.

TI  - Methionine synthase A2756G polymorphism may predict ulcerative colitis and
      methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T pancolitis, in Central China.
PG  - 78
LID - 10.1186/1471-2350-9-78 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The association of genetic polymorphisms related to metabolism of
      homocysteine with inflammatory bowel disease has been evidenced in Crohn disease 
      and remains an open question in ulcerative colitis. We evaluated the association 
      of the polymorphisms of MTHFR, MTR, MTRR and TCN2 genes with ulcerative colitis
      in Central China. METHODS: 168 patients were genotyped for these polymorphisms
      and compared to 219 matched controls. RESULTS: Methionine synthase 2756G allele
      frequency was higher in ulcerative colitis than in controls 0.15 (95% C.I.
      0.11-0.19) vs 0.09 (95% C.I. 0.07 - 0.12), (P = 0.0137) and predicted ulcerative 
      colitis risk in logistic regression, with an Odds ratio at 1.8 (95% C.I.
      1.15-2.84). Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 677TT genotype was 2.7-fold more 
      prevalent in individuals with pancolitis than in those with left colitis or
      proctitis, with respective percentages of 27.3 (95% C.I.16.4-42.0) and 10.5 (95% 
      C.I. 6.3-17.1) (P = 0.0123). The carriage of 677TT or 677CT/1298AC genotypes of
      methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase was more frequent in cases with pancolitis
      than in subjects with left colitis or proctitis (P = 0.0048), with an Odds ratio 
      adjusted by age and sex at 3.3 (95% C.I. 1.4-7.9), P = 0.0084) in logistic
      regression. CONCLUSION: Methionine synthase and methylenetetrahydrofolate
      reductase are genes of vitamin B12 and folate cellular metabolism associated
      respectively with risk and extent of ulcerative colitis, at least in Central
      China. This finding may open new insights, particularly for the potential
      interest in treating patients carrying the 677TT MTHFR genetic trait and a
      deficit in folate.

TI  - Single nucleotide polymorphism in the tumor necrosis factor-alpha gene affects
      inflammatory bowel diseases risk.
PG  - 4652-61
AB  - AIM: To investigate the role that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the
      promoter of the tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) gene play in the risk of
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) in a New Zealand population, in the context of
      international studies. METHODS: DNA samples from 388 patients with Crohn's
      disease (CD), 405 ulcerative colitis (UC), 27 indeterminate colitis (IC) and 201 
      randomly selected controls, from Canterbury, New Zealand were screened for 3
      common polymorphisms in the TNF-alpha receptor: -238 G-->A, -308 G-->A and
      -857C-->T, using a Taqman assay. A meta-analysis was performed on the data
      obtained on these polymorphisms combined with that from other published studies. 
      RESULTS: Individuals carrying the -308 G/A allele had a significantly (OR = 1.91,
      c2 = 17.36, P < 0.0001) increased risk of pancolitis, and a 1.57-fold increased
      risk (OR = 1.57, c2 = 4.34, P = 0.037) of requiring a bowel resection in UC.
      Carrying the -857 C/T variant decreased the risk of ileocolonic CD (OR = 0.56, c2
      = 4.32, P = 0.037), and the need for a bowel resection (OR = 0.59, c2 = 4.85, P =
      0.028). The risk of UC was reduced in individuals who were smokers at diagnosis, 
      (OR = 0.48, c2 = 4.86, P = 0.028). CONCLUSION: TNF-alpha is a key cytokine known 
      to play a role in inflammatory response, and the locus for the gene is found in
      the IBD3 region on chromosome 6p21, known to be associated with an increased risk
      for IBD. The -308 G/A SNP in the TNF-alpha promoter is functional, and may
      account in part for the increased UC risk associated with the IBD3 genomic
      region. The -857 C/T SNP may decrease IBD risk in certain groups. Pharmaco- or
      nutrigenomic approaches may be desirable for individuals with such affected
      genotypes.

TI  - [Antibiotic-associated diarrhea].
PG  - 1207-12
AB  - Most of the cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea are benign, self-limited and 
      presumably related to functional consequences of the alteration of gut
      microflora. In few cases, changes in the gut flora ecosystem allow pathogens to
      proliferate. Clostridium difficile is responsible for approximately 10% of the
      cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in the community, most of the cases of
      antibiotic-associated colitis, and almost all the cases of pseudomembranous
      colitis. According to anatomoclinical increasing severity of the disease, C.
      difficile infections should be treated with metronidazole, vancomycin,
      intravenous immunoglobulins or colectomy. Klebsiella oxytoca is naturally
      resistant to bela-lactamins and causes occasionally heamorrhagic colitis,
      mimicking in some cases ischemic colitis.

TI  - Phlebosclerotic colitis.
PG  - 164-7
AB  - Phlebosclerotic colitis (PC) is a rare form of ischemic colitis that usually
      affects the right hemicolon. It is due to ischemia induced by phlebosclerosis in 
      the branches of the superior mesenteric vein that disturb venous return from the 
      colon. The clinical course is different from that of the more common type of
      ischemic colitis caused by arterial disease. We encountered a 73-year-old woman
      with PC who had the characteristic computed tomographic finding of fine linear
      venous calcification that was mainly perpendicular to the long axis of the colon.

      male with severe ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 4576-9
AB  - The risk of thromboembolism is increased in inflammatory bowel disease and its
      symptoms may be overlooked. Furthermore, its treatment can be complex and is not 
      without complications. We describe a case of an adolescent boy who developed a
      cerebral sinus venous thrombosis during a relapse of his ulcerative colitis and
      who, while on treatment with heparin, developed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia 
      (HIT). The treatment was then switched to fondaparinux, a synthetic and selective
      inhibitor of activated factor X.

PG  - 1022-42
LID - 10.1080/00498250701875254 [doi]
AB  - 1. The peptide transporters belong to the peptide transporter (PTR) family and
      serve as integral membrane proteins for the cellular uptake of di- and
      tripeptides in the organism. By their ability also to transport peptidomimetics
      and other substrates with therapeutic activities or precursors of
      pharmacologically active agents, they are of considerable importance in
      pharmacology. 2. PEPT1 is the low-affinity, high-capacity transporter and is
      mainly expressed in the small intestine, whereas PEPT2 is the high-affinity,
      low-capacity transporter and has a broader distribution in the organism. 3.
      Targeted mouse models have revealed PEPT2 to be the dominant transporter for the 
      reabsorption of di- and tripeptides and its pharmacological substrates in the
      organism, and for the removal of these substrates from the cerebrospinal fluid.
      Moreover, the peptide transporters undergo physiological and pharmacological
      regulation and, of great interest, are present in disease states where PEPT1
      exhibits ectopic expression in colonic inflammation. 4. The paper reviews the
      structural characteristics of the peptide transporters, the structural
      requirements for substrates, the distribution of the peptide transporters in the 
      organism, and finally their regulation in the organism in healthy and
      pathological situations.

TI  - Severe chest pain in a pediatric ulcerative colitis patient after
      5-aminosalicylic acid therapy.
PG  - 4400-2
AB  - Severe reactions to mesalamine products are rarely seen in pediatric patients. We
      report a case of a 12-year-old boy who had a severe cardiac reaction to a
      mesalamine product Asacol. Past medical history is significant for ulcerative
      colitis (UC) diagnosed at 9 years of age. Colonoscopy one week prior to admission
      revealed pancolitis. He was treated with Asacol 800 mg three times per day and
      prednisone 20 mg/d. He was subsequently admitted to the hospital for an
      exacerbation of his UC and started on intravenous solumedrol. He had improvement 
      of his abdominal pain and diarrhea. The patient complained of new onset of chest 
      pain upon initiating Asacol therapy. Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed
      non-specific ST-T wave changes with T-wave inversion in the lateral leads.
      Echocardiogram (ECHO) revealed low-normal to mildly depressed left ventricular
      systolic function. The left main coronary artery and left anterior descending
      artery were mildly prominent measuring 5 mm and 4.7 mm, respectively. His chest
      pain completely resolved within 24-36 h of discontinuing Asacol. A repeat
      echocardiogram performed two days later revealed normal left ventricular function
      with normal coronary arteries (< 3.5 mm). Onset of chest pain after Asacol and
      immediate improvement of chest pain, as well as improvement of echocardiogram and
      ECG findings after discontinuing Asacol suggests that our patient suffered from a
      rare drug-hypersensitivity reaction to Asacol.

AB  - Twenty-eight exclusively breast-fed healthy infants and 16 infants also
      exclusively breast-fed with allergic colitis (aged 85 +/- 60 and 98 +/- 58 d,
      respectively) were screened for differences in fecal flora. Bifidobacteria were
      detected in 23 healthy infants and only in 4 fecal samples of infants with
      allergic colitis. All bifidobacteria-free infants possessed Gram-positive regular
      rods as a major group of their fecal flora. These bacteria were identified as
      clostridia using genus-specific FISH probe. Infants with allergy colitis
      possessed significantly lower counts of bifidobacteria and total anaerobes and
      significantly higher counts of clostridia in their feces. In healthy infants,
      Bifidobacterium longum was the most frequently found species (54.5% of the
      samples), followed by B. adolescentis (20.0), B. breve (18.2), B. bifidum (16.4),
      B. dentium (10.9) and B. pseudocatenulatum (1.80). Bifidobacterial isolates from 
      two babies with allergic colitis were identified as B. longum, one child from
      patients group contained species B. dentium and one baby B. adolescentis. Our
      results suggest that there are significantly lower counts of bifidobacteria in
      infants with allergic colitis than in healthy infants.

      remission in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 362-5
LID - 10.1016/j.biopha.2008.06.029 [doi]
AB  - Despite the accumulation of positive data, the role of azathioprine (AZA) in the 
      maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis is still controversial. We looked 
      at the follow-up of the ulcerative colitis patients who, after responding to
      either steroids or cyclosporin (CsA), received AZA at our referral center for
      over a decade. The 39 patients (29 m/10f) were treated between 1991 and 2007.
      Twenty-five of them had responded to CsA, the remaining 14 to corticosteroids.
      AZA was usually overlapped with either of the two agents at the initial dose of
      2mg/kg/day. The definitions of remission, relapse, and AZA toxicity followed
      commonly agreed criteria. The median duration of the AZA treatment was 14 months 
      (<1-201). Fifty-two percent and 14%, respectively, of the CsA and the steroid
      responders needed surgery (overall rate=38%). The figures were 32 and 15 at the
      first year. The majority of the patients had 1-2 relapses often in connection
      with withdrawal of AZA; only 3 of these relapsers needed hospitalization. AZA
      caused toxicity in 16/39 (41%) patients, requiring withdrawal in 23% of the
      cases; leukopenia (17%) and hepatitis/cholestasis (10%) ranked first and second
      for frequency. All of the patients in whom AZA was stopped (or reduced) relapsed.
      In conclusion, the 1-year colectomy rates compare favorably with the figures
      reported by the literature. By contrast, the toxicity rates were higher than
      expected. Failure to genotype or to use escalating AZA doses can only be
      hypothesized as causes.

TI  - Increased folate intake with no changes in serum homocysteine and decreased
      levels of C-reactive protein in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 627-33
LID - 10.1007/s10620-008-0398-4 [doi]
AB  - In order to increase dietary folic acid intake and to improve nutritional status 
      regarding folate by controlling homocysteine concentrations, ten patients with
      inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease in the colon and ulcerative colitis)
      received individualized nutritional guidance and were followed up as outpatients 
      for 2 months. The following procedures were performed at the beginning of the
      study (T0), after 1 month (T1) and at the end of the study (T2): collection of
      anthropometric data (weight and height), dietary data (24 h diet recall), and
      blood under fasting condition for the determination of serum folic acid,
      homocysteine, C-reactive protein, and vitamin B12. Plasma folic acid deficiency
      was not detected but hyperhomocysteinemia was present in six individuals and
      C-reactive protein (CRP) was increased (>0.5 mg/dl) in seven patients. After the 
      patients were instructed there was a significant increase in vitamin B6 intake
      (about 35%) and in folate intake (49.6%). Mean plasma levels of folic acid,
      homocysteine, and vitamin B12 did not change, but there was a significant
      decrease of CRP at T1, 0.36 mg dl(-1) on average (P = 0.01), which was maintained
      at T2. We conclude that the increased folate intake reported by this group of
      patients was not reflected in improved serum concentrations of folic acid and
      homocysteine. However, the guidelines for the patients probably induced them to
      choose a more adequate diet, providing nutrients that help control the
      inflammatory process.

TI  - Short-term response to adalimumab in childhood inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1683-7
LID - 10.1002/ibd.20534 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adalimumab is effective for adults with moderate to severe Crohn's
      disease (CD). Data in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is sparse.
      We aim to evaluate pediatric IBD response to adalimumab. METHODS: We conducted a 
      retrospective chart review of pediatric IBD patients treated with adalimumab. We 
      defined response as either a decrease in the disease activity index severity or
      remission after 3-6 months of treatment. RESULTS: Ten patients were identified.
      Seven had CD, three had ulcerative colitis (UC). All had colonic disease and
      disease in either the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum. Eight patients initially
      responded to infliximab, 5 with CD and 3 with UC; 2 CD patients had incomplete
      data for evaluation. The mean and median times between initial infliximab and
      initial adalimumab were 29.5 and 24 months, respectively. Eight patients
      responded to adalimumab 40 mg or 80 mg biweekly, or 80 mg initial dose followed
      by 40 mg biweekly. The mean Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) in
      CD patients before and after adalimumab were 12 and 4.2, respectively (normal
      <or=10). The mean Lichtiger Colitis Activity Index (LCAI) in UC patients before
      and after adalimumab were 9 and 5.1, respectively (normal <10). Corticosteroids
      were weaned off in 4/7 patients at 1 to 10 months after initiation of adalimumab.
      One patient with CD and 1 patient with UC failed adalimumab, required surgery,
      and remained on corticosteroids. CONCLUSIONS: Adalimumab is useful in pediatric
      IBD patients who become intolerant of infliximab.

TI  - The emerging role of docosahexaenoic acid in neuroinflammation.
PG  - 735-43
AB  - Epidemiological studies have linked fish consumption to lower rates of
      neurological diseases. Fish contains high levels of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty
      acids (n-3 PUFA), and several lines of evidence suggest that the n-3 PUFA
      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) acts in the brain via anti-apoptotic and
      neurotrophic pathways. In addition, DHA may act through anti-neuroinflammatory
      pathways, as DHA possesses anti-inflammatory properties in the periphery.
      Evidence from animal models has indicated that DHA and its derivatives (resolvin 
      D1 and protectin D1) attenuate colitis, peritonitis and ischemic stroke. n-3 PUFA
      deprivation in rats decreases brain levels of DHA and increases markers of the
      brain arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) cascade, a proinflammatory pathway. Thus,
      chronic low intake of n-3 PUFA may predispose the brain to weak
      anti-inflammatory, as well as strong proinflammatory signals. Neurological
      disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and major
      depression, display a neuroinflammatory component. n-3 PUFA supplementation, as
      well as drugs targeting brain PUFA metabolism, are promising candidates in the
      prevention and treatment of neurological disorders.

AB  - AIM: To provide a review of studies on prognosis in ulcerative colitis by
      reviewing the relevant population-based cohort studies. On the basis of incidence
      and population studies, ulcerative colitis has a favourable clinical course, with
      good quality of life, a chronic course characterized by at least one relapse, and
      a surgery rate of 30% after 10 years from diagnosis. Patients affected by severe 
      ulcerative colitis have a higher risk of colectomy, and some clinical variables
      may predict the disease's clinical course. Most patients respond to steroids and 
      only a low percentage become dependent, or non-responders to steroids. Patients
      who have a long-lasting ulcerative colitis (>10 years) or are affected by an
      extensive disease have an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer, while
      those treated with immunosuppressants for long period of time may have an
      increased risk of developing lymphomas. Data on mortality in ulcerative colitis
      patients are not homogeneous, but if a real risk exists it is in patients with
      extensive or severe disease. The evidence that patients with severe ulcerative
      colitis are often non-smokers may explain why in one study the mortality rate was
      lower.

LID - 10.1586/14737159.8.4.465 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease is a complex multifactorial disease with a strong
      genetic component. Recent studies have identified innate immunity (NOD2),
      autophagy (ATG16L1) and Th17 pathway (IL23R) genes in the pathogenesis of Crohn's
      disease. The pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC) is less clear; however,
      there is growing evidence that proteins involved in the apical junction complex
      are involved in UC. Here we review the up-to-date studies on the genetic basis
      for IBD and explore the newly described UC-associated apical junction complex
      pointing to a primary defect in barrier defense. We will focus on the PTPRS
      (encoding PTPsigma) gene and discuss its and other apical junction complex
      proteins' role in the pathogenesis of UC.

PG  - 257-60
LID - 10.1080/09513590802002163 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Estrogen and progestins have established effects on the
      gastrointestinal tract and ischemic colitis was related in the past with certain 
      regimens including both hormones. On this basis, we aimed to evaluate a group of 
      postmenopausal women who presented with ischemic colitis after taking hormone
      replacement therapy (HRT) for the last several months. METHOD: Postmenopausal
      women taking conjugated estrogens, conjugated estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone 
      acetate, 17beta-estradiol plus norethisterone and estradiol valerate plus
      norgestrel are included in the present study. All patients, without a medical
      history of bowel problems, reported an acute crisis of colitis a few months after
      the beginning of the treatment. RESULTS: Fasting, parenteral nutrition,
      intravenous antibiotic treatment with metronidazole and discontinuation of HRT
      proved successful. Antibiotics were continued after the patients' discharge from 
      the hospital. A second-look colonoscopy, 3 to 4 months after the initial episode,
      was normal in all cases. CONCLUSION: Ischemic colitis is a rare complication of
      HRT that should not be ignored when HRT is prescribed.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is uncommon in children younger than 2 years of 
      age. The criteria for differentiating IBD from other diseases with similar
      clinical presentation is unclear. We describe 16 patients who, between 1984 and
      2004, received a histological diagnosis of IBD during the first two years of
      life. Six patients presented with histological Crohn's disease, eight with
      ulcerative colitis and two with indeterminate colitis. The median age at
      diagnosis was 125 days (range 1 day to 18 months) and the medium follow up was 89
      months (range 65 days to 20 years). The disease appeared to be very severe: four 
      children (25%) underwent total parenteral nutrition (TPN), two received colectomy
      (12.5%) and three patients died. Many of the patients required an aggressive,
      multidrug, immunosuppressive approach (azathioprine [AZA], Infliximab,
      thalidomide, cyclosporine A). One child presented with a hypogammaglobulinaemia
      without any specific immunodeficiency, while in the other patients,
      Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) (4 cases) and chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) 
      (2 cases) were identified. In 6/16 cases, allergic colitis was first considered; 
      these cases initially underwent cow's milk protein-free diet as the only therapy 
      before IBD was finally diagnosed. In conclusion, early IBD has a severe prognosis
      and often needs an aggressive therapeutic approach. Furthermore, an improper
      diagnosis of allergic colitis might cause an important diagnostic delay. Some
      severe immunodeficiencies, such as WAS and CGD, may represent a problem in terms 
      of differential diagnosis and might be wrongly diagnosed as very early onset IBD.

TI  - Toxic megacolon in children with inflammatory bowel disease: clinical and
      radiographic characteristics.
PG  - 1524-31
LID - 10.1111/j.1572-0241.2008.01807.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Toxic megacolon (TMC) denotes a rare clinical syndrome accompanied by
      colonic dilatation, and is a serious complication of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD). This study assessed the clinical and radiologic characteristics of TMC in 
      children with IBD. METHODS: A systematic search identified patients with
      IBD-associated TMC and matched them by age to controls with ulcerative colitis
      without evidence of TMC. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared with
      conditional logistic regression. Abdominal X-rays were interpreted by two blinded
      radiologists and findings were compared with controls. RESULTS: Ten children with
      TMC (median age 12.6 [7.3-15.5] yr) were matched with 20 controls (median age
      12.8 [6.8-15.2] yr). Altered level of consciousness and hypotension were rare in 
      children with TMC. Fever (P= 0.005), tachycardia (P= 0.0001), dehydration (P=
      0.01), and electrolyte abnormalities (P= 0.0002) were more common in children
      with TMC than controls. Air-fluid levels (P= 0.005), intestinal thickening (P=
      0.006), and abnormal colonic haustra (P= 0.012) were more commonly seen on X-rays
      of TMC cases. Transverse colon luminal diameter >or=56 mm was strongly suggestive
      of TMC (sensitivity 90%, specificity 90%, area under the ROC curve 0.91). No
      child with TMC died and 70% required colectomy during admission. Two of the three
      with intact colons at discharge required second-line therapy during the
      subsequent year. CONCLUSIONS: Colonic dilatation >or=56 mm in children with IBD
      strongly suggests TMC, if clinical signs are present. Mental alteration and
      hypotension may be less common in children than in adults. TMC in children with
      IBD is associated with poor outcome, with a high rate of corticosteroid failure.

      diseases.
PG  - 885-97
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.200700289 [doi]
AB  - With regard to inflammatory processes, the main fatty acids of interest are the
      n-6 PUFA arachidonic acid (AA), which is the precursor of inflammatory
      eicosanoids like prostaglandin E(2) and leukotriene B(4), and the n-3 PUFAs
      eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). EPA and DHA are found
      in oily fish and fish oils. EPA and DHA inhibit AA metabolism to inflammatory
      eicosanoids. They also give rise to mediators that are less inflammatory than
      those produced from AA or that are anti-inflammatory. In addition to modifying
      the lipid mediator profile, n-3 PUFAs exert effects on other aspects of
      inflammation like leukocyte chemotaxis and inflammatory cytokine production. Some
      of these effects are likely due to changes in gene expression, as a result of
      altered transcription factor activity. Fish oil has been shown to decrease
      colonic damage and inflammation, weight loss and mortality in animal models of
      colitis. Fish oil supplementation in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases
      results in n-3 PUFA incorporation into gut mucosal tissue and modification of
      inflammatory mediator profiles. Clinical outcomes have been variably affected by 
      fish oil, although some trials report improved gut histology, decreased disease
      activity, use of corticosteroids and relapse.

TI  - Malnutrition and impaired muscle strength in patients with Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis in remission.
PG  - 694-702
LID - 10.1016/j.nut.2008.03.018 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This prospective, controlled, and multicentric study evaluated
      nutritional status, body composition, muscle strength, and quality of life in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease in clinical remission. In addition,
      possible effects of gender, malnutrition, inflammation, and previous prednisolone
      therapy were investigated. METHODS: Nutritional status (subjective global
      assessment [SGA], body mass index, albumin, trace elements), body composition
      (bioelectrical impedance analysis, anthropometry), handgrip strength, and quality
      of life were assessed in 94 patients with Crohn's disease (CD; 61 female and 33
      male, Crohn's Disease Activity Index 71 +/- 47), 50 patients with ulcerative
      colitis (UC; 33 female and 17 male, Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index 3.1 +/-
      1.5), and 61 healthy control subjects (41 female and 20 male) from centers in
      Berlin, Vienna, and Bari. For further analysis of body composition, 47
      well-nourished patients with inflammatory bowel disease were pair-matched by body
      mass index, sex, and age to healthy controls. Data are presented as median
      (25th-75th percentile). RESULTS: Most patients with inflammatory bowel disease
      (74%) were well nourished according to the SGA, body mass index, and serum
      albumin. However, body composition analysis demonstrated a decrease in body cell 
      mass (BCM) in patients with CD (23.1 kg, 20.8-28.7, P = 0.021) and UC (22.6 kg,
      21.0-28.0, P = 0.041) compared with controls (25.0 kg, 22.0-32.5). Handgrip
      strength correlated with BCM (r = 0.703, P = 0.001) and was decreased in patients
      with CD (32.8 kg, 26.0-41.1, P = 0.005) and UC (31.0 kg, 27.3-37.8, P = 0.001)
      compared with controls (36.0 kg, 31.0-52.0). The alterations were seen even in
      patients classified as well nourished. BCM was lower in patients with moderately 
      increased serum C-reactive protein levels compared with patients with normal
      levels. CONCLUSION: In CD and UC, selected micronutrient deficits and loss of BCM
      and muscle strength are frequent in remission and cannot be detected by standard 
      malnutrition screening.

PG  - 580-7
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2982.2008.01139.x [doi]
AB  - Digestive tract proteases are best known for their proteolytic activity in the
      digestion of alimentary proteins. However, during the last decade, a possible
      role of proteases as signalling molecules has been emphasized with the discovery 
      of a novel class of G-protein coupled receptors located on cell membranes that
      may be activated by proteolytic cleavage of their N-terminal extracellular
      domain. Type 2 protease-activated receptors (PAR-2) are cleaved by
      serine-proteases such as trypsin and tryptase. PAR-2 is present in many
      intestinal cell types and particularly on epithelial cells. Multiple functions
      have been demonstrated in the gut for PAR-2, including epithelial permeability,
      mainly the intercellular permeability that is of paramount importance in the
      equilibrium between the external milieu (digestive contents) and the submucosal
      immune system. Alterations of both tissue and luminal levels of proteases or
      serine-protease activity may affect gut permeability and subsequently the immune 
      status of the mucosa. Activation of PAR-2 on epithelial cells may directly affect
      cytoskeleton contraction by triggering phosphorylation of myosin light chain with
      subsequent changes in tight junction permeability. Enhanced fecal protease level 
      has been recently reported in both organic (ulcerative colitis) and functional
      (irritable bowel syndrome) intestinal disorders and may play a role in the
      pathogenesis of such diseases.

TI  - GPx2 counteracts PGE2 production by dampening COX-2 and mPGES-1 expression in
      human colon cancer cells.
PG  - 1491-500
LID - 10.1089/ars.2008.2047 [doi]
AB  - GPx2, the gastrointestinal glutathione peroxidase, is a selenoprotein
      predominantly expressed in the intestine. An anti-inflammatory and
      anticarcinogenic potential has been inferred from the development of colitis and 
      intestinal cancer in GPx1 and GPx2 double knockout mice. Further, induction by
      Nrf2 activators classifies GPx2 as a protective enzyme. In contrast, enhanced
      COX-2 expression is consistently associated with inflammation. The antagonistic
      roles and an intriguing co-localization of GPx2 and COX-2 prompted us to
      investigate their possible mutual regulation. Both enzymes were upregulated in
      tissues of patients with colorectal cancer and colitis, and co-localized in the
      endoplasmic reticulum. A stable knockdown of GPx2 in HT-29 cells by siRNA
      resulted in a high basal and IL-1-induced expression of COX-2 and mPGES-1,
      enzymes required for the production of the pro-inflammatory PGE(2). Accordingly, 
      si-GPx2 cells released high concentrations of PGE(2). Observed effects were
      specific for GPx2, since COX-2 and mPGES-1 expression was not affected by
      selenium-deprivation which resulted in the disappearance of GPx1. It is concluded
      that GPx2 by compartmentalized removal of hydroperoxides silences COX-2 activity 
      and suppresses PGE(2)-dependent COX-2 expression. Thus, GPx2 may prevent undue
      responses to inflammatory stimuli and, in consequence, inflammation-driven
      initiation of carcinogenesis.

TI  - [Treatment of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases].
PG  - 1125-41; discussion 1141
AB  - The same drugs are used to treat hemorrhagic rectocolitis (HRC) and Crohn's
      disease (CD), although the aims are very different. Aminosalicylates are highly
      beneficial in HRC but virtually ineffective in CD, a disease in which
      immunosuppressants are more useful. Aminosalicylates exert their antiinflammatory
      effect directly on the lesions. Various oral and rectal preparations have been
      developed in order to deliver the active molecule to the intestinal target
      segment. These drugs are now known to act by stimulating the nuclear receptor
      PPAR-gamma, and this knowledge should help with the development of new agents.
      Chronic aminosalicylate treatment appears to diminish the risk of malignant
      transformation. Systemic steroids are still the mainstay of treatment for
      exacerbations of HRC and CD, yielding remissions in 60 to 90% of cases. In
      contrast, systemic steroids should not be used for maintenance therapy.
      Budesonide is a preparation that selectively releases steroids in the ileocolonic
      region, thereby reducing systemic adverse effects. Immunosuppressants such as
      azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine, and also methotrexate in some cases, are used 
      for maintenance therapy of steroid-dependent and highly recurrent forms. These
      drugs stabilize the disease in about half the patients who receive them.
      Treatment typically lasts several years and necessitates regular monitoring,
      especially of hematological status. Cyclosporine is used intravenously in severe 
      HRC. Infliximab (RemicadeR), a chimeric monoclonal antibody targeting TNF is
      effective in acute forms and as maintenance therapy for CD. It was also recently 
      shown to be effective in HRC. Infliximab is indicated in steroid-resistant forms 
      and contraindicated in patients with latent systemic infections (tuberculosis,
      hepatitis B) and heart failure. Artificial nutrition is now only used in children
      with acute forms, in order to avoid the need for steroids. Probiotics might have 
      a place in maintenance treatment of HRC. Surgical treatment of HRC consists of
      colectomy or, more radically, ileoprotectomy followed by ileoanal anastomosis
      with resection: however, the likely benefits and potential complications
      (especially nocturnal diarrhea) must be carefully weighed up. Surgical treatment 
      of CD consists of resecting the worst-affected segments. As available medical and
      surgical treatments can only control these diseases, without curing them, patient
      management must be planned on a long-term basis. Control of exacerbations is
      judged on the basis of clinical parameters and biological markers of
      inflammation, rather than on lesion healing. The choice of maintenance therapy
      depends on the nature of the disease (HRC or CD) and its progressive nature.
      Surgery is reserved for patients with complicated and drug-resistant forms.

TI  - Single nucleotide polymorphisms in human Paneth cell defensin A5 may confer
      susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease in a New Zealand Caucasian
      population.
PG  - 723-30
LID - 10.1016/j.dld.2008.02.011 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human Paneth cell alpha-defensins, especially DEFA5, are involved in 
      maintaining homeostasis of the human microbial microflora. Since breakdown of
      normal mucosal antibacterial defence occurs in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), 
      variants in the DEFA5 gene could be associated with IBD risk. SUBJECTS: A cohort 
      of 25 patients with indeterminate colitis (IC), 405 with ulcerative colitis (UC),
      and 385 with Crohn's disease (CD), were compared with 201 control individuals
      from the Canterbury region in New Zealand. METHODS: A 15 kb haplotype block
      surrounding DEFA5 contained 35 HapMap markers which were polymorphic in
      Caucasians. Four markers (A-D) were selected to tag 27 of the 35 markers at
      r(2)>0.68, and were genotyped in DNA samples. RESULTS: Minor allele frequencies
      for all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were somewhat elevated in
      patients. Subgroup analysis showed SNP A had odds ratio 1.44 in UC patients with 
      pancolitis (95% C.I. 1.07-1.94), SNP B odds ratio 2.37 in CD patients with onset 
      prior to 17 years age (95% C.I. 1.12-5.03), SNP C odds ratio 1.68 in UC patients 
      with left colonic localisation (95% C.I. 1.12-2.52), and SNP D had odds ratio
      1.56 in CD patients with one or more relatives with IBD (95% C.I. 1.03-2.35). Two
      two-marker haplotypes and one three-marker haplotype were associated with UC
      (p-values 0.025-0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The SNPs genotyped in our study were
      surrogates for common variants, and observed associations between these and IBD
      status are likely due to linkage disequilibrium with a functional common DEFA5
      variant. Identifying such functional variants will be prioritized in subsequent
      work.

TI  - Is there any place for alimentary probiotics, prebiotics or synbiotics, for
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease?
PG  - 906-12
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.200700147 [doi]
AB  - The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves an interaction
      between genetically determined host susceptibility, dysregulated immune response,
      and the enteric microbiota. Ecological treatments including probiotics,
      prebiotics, and synbiotics are actively studied in Crohn's disease (CD),
      ulcerative colitis (UC) and pouchitis. We review herein the literature on the
      rational use of probiotics in IBD considering efficacy (as evaluated in
      randomized controlled trials), mechanisms of action and safety issues. A
      probiotic effect is strictly restricted to one defined strain and cannot be
      generalized from one to another. There is evidence of efficacy of some probiotic 
      drugs in pouchitis (VSL#3), and in the prevention of recurrence of UC
      (Escherichia coli Nissle 1917). However, the evidence for efficacy of probiotic
      drugs in CD is still low as well as that of dietary ecological treatments.
      Despite an ecological (hopefully nutritional) treatment of IBD is promising, many
      questions remain unanswered and further clinical and fundamental studies are
      needed.

TI  - Spectrum of microscopic colitis in a tertiary care centre in India.
PG  - 121-5
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The incidence of microscopic colitis has recently increased.
      Although collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis are the two main subtypes of
      microscopic colitis, many patients may not fit into either category and are thus 
      included under the header nonspecific colitis. Of late, the spectrum of
      microscopic colitis has widened to include minimal change colitis, microscopic
      colitis not otherwise specified and microscopic colitis with giant cells. There
      is a lack of information concerning the spectrum of microscopic colitis in Asia. 
      METHOD: In a retrospective analysis, case records of 29 patients diagnosed with
      microscopic colitis between 1999-2005 were analysed. Drug use parasitic infection
      and common bacterial infections were excluded. Colonoscopic/ sigmoidoscopic
      examination was done and multiple colonic mucosal biopsies were stained serially 
      with haematoxylin and eosin for detailed histological examination and Masson
      trichrome for sub-epithelial collagen band. Based on histological criteria,
      patients were categorised into five subtypes: collagenous colitis (presence of
      collagenous thickening of surface epithelium basement membrane > 10 microm),
      lymphocytic colitis (intra-epithelial lymphocytes more than 20 per 100
      colonocytes), minimal change colitis (crypt architectural abnormality in the form
      of cryptitis and crypt dilatation in the absence of increase in intraepithelial
      lymphocytes and subepithelial collagenous band), microscopic colitis not
      otherwise specified (increased inflammatory cell infiltrates in the lamina
      propria in the absence of other abnormalities) and microscopic colitis with giant
      cells. RESULTS: Mean age of patients was 38.59 years (range 12-62). Of 29
      patients with microscopic colitis, 7 (24.1%), 4 (13.8%), 7 (24.1%) and 11 (37.9%)
      were classified as collagenous colitis, lymphocytic colitis, minimal change
      colitis and microscopic colitis not otherwise specified, respectively. None of
      these patients had giant cells. There was no significant correlation between
      disease type and clinical manifestations. CONCLUSION: Microscopic colitis has a
      wide histological spectrum. Cases reported as non-specific colitis, may be
      categorised into definite subtypes of microscopic colitis.

TI  - IBD in children: lessons for adults.
PG  - 528-32
AB  - When children develop inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), physicians and
      researchers are presented with a singular opportunity to understand the nature of
      these chronic, idiopathic illnesses in the earliest stages. Genetic
      susceptibility factors tend to be common, whereas complicating environmental
      factors such as cigarette smoking are generally not an issue. As opposed to the
      case in adult patients, Crohn's disease is usually diagnosed in children at an
      early, inflammatory phase of the disease. Pediatric ulcerative colitis tends to
      present with more severe and more extensive involvement than in adults. In both
      forms of IBD, the severity of disease activity often dictates the need for early 
      aggressive nutritional, immunomodulatory, and biologic therapy. As a result, the 
      lessons learned from the evaluation and treatment of children with IBD are
      critically important to the clinician caring for adults with the same disorders.

TI  - Esophageal, gastric, and duodenal manifestations of IBD and the role of upper
      endoscopy in IBD diagnosis.
PG  - 475-8
AB  - Upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease has 
      become increasingly recognized, even in the absence of specific localizing
      symptoms, as patients more frequently undergo upper endoscopy. Although the
      recent Montreal classification system allowed classification of upper GI
      involvement in Crohn's disease (CD), independent of other locations, a consensus 
      regarding the definition of what qualifies as significant "involvement" is still 
      lacking. Reported incidence data vary considerably depending on the definitions
      used and the selected target population. Pediatric data suggest that upper
      endoscopy is useful in differentiating CD from ulcerative colitis, when
      inflammation is otherwise predominantly confined to the colon; however, this
      question has yet to be studied in adults. Infliximab therapy for upper GI-CD
      seems as effective as that seen for more distal GI inflammation.

TI  - Effects of short-term oral administration of dietary marine oils in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease and joint pain: a pilot study comparing seal oil and
      cod liver oil.
PG  - 614-22
LID - 10.1016/j.clnu.2008.01.017 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Very long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have modulating
      effects on inflammatory mechanisms. Seal and fish oils are rich in n-3
      polyunsaturated fatty acids, and possibly therefore high doses of nasoduodenally 
      administered seal oil rapidly relieved inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD)-associated joint pain in two recent studies. In the present study, we
      compared the effects of short-term oral administration of seal oil and cod liver 
      oil on IBD-related joint pain, leucotriene B(4) level, serum fatty acid profile
      and IBD activity. METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with IBD-related joint pain were
      included in the study; 21 had Crohn's disease and 17 ulcerative colitis. Ten
      milliters of seal oil (n=18) or cod liver oil (n=20) was self-administered orally
      3 times a day for 14 days before meals in a double-blind setting. RESULTS: There 
      were no significant differences between the two intervention groups or between
      Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients. There was a tendency toward
      improvement in several joint pain parameters after both seal oil and cod liver
      oil administration. Further, plasma leucotriene B(4) concentration, serum Sigma
      n-6 to Sigma n-3, and arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) to eicosapentaenoic acid
      (20:5n-3) ratios were similarly reduced after administration of seal oil and cod 
      liver oil. CONCLUSION: No significant differences in the two treatment groups
      were seen; in both groups, the changes in several joint pain parameters,
      leucotriene B(4) level of plasma, and serum fatty acid profile were putatively
      favourable.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of granulocyte and monocyte adsorption apheresis in
      paediatric inflammatory bowel disease: a prospective pilot study.
PG  - 386-91
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e31815604e5 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Selective granulocyte-monocyte adsorption (GMA) apheresis is a safe
      technique that has shown efficacy in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially
      in adult steroid-dependent and steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis. GMA
      apheresis is performed with Adacolumn, a direct blood perfusion system that
      selectively adsorbs circulating granulocytes and monocytes. Studies on efficacy
      of GMA apheresis in paediatric IBD are scarce. Our aim was to evaluate efficacy, 
      safety, and tolerability of GMA apheresis in paediatric IBD patients followed for
      1 year. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nine patients with a mild to moderate flare-up (6
      boys, 3 girls; 5 ulcerative colitis [UC], 4 Crohn disease [CD]) were included.
      Mean age at inclusion was 13 years and 9 months, and mean disease duration before
      inclusion was 28 months. All of our patients with UC were steroid-dependent;
      patients with CD had been unsuccessfully treated with other therapies. GMA
      apheresis consisted of 5 consecutive weekly sessions lasting 60 minutes each.
      RESULTS: After the 5 sessions, 4 of 5 patients with UC and 1 of 4 patients with
      CD achieved remission. This remission was maintained in 2 of 4 patients with UC
      and in the single patients with CD. Patients taking steroids could begin to taper
      their daily doses after the second apheresis, and 3 of 5 of these patients
      reached the end of the study steroid-free. GMA apheresis was well tolerated and
      no severe side effects related to the technique were observed. CONCLUSIONS: GMA
      apheresis is a safe, well-tolerated technique in paediatric IBD. As previously
      reported, we have observed a better efficacy in promoting and maintaining
      remission, and reducing conventional drugs in patients with UC than in patients
      with CD.

TI  - Severe systemic cytomegalovirus infections in patients with steroid-refractory
      ulcerative colitis treated by an oral microemulsion form of cyclosporine: report 
      of two cases.
PG  - 460-4
LID - 10.1016/j.gcb.2007.10.010 [doi]
AB  - CMV reactivation is frequently observed in acute flares of ulcerative colitis
      (UC), particularly those which do not respond to intravenous steroids. Several
      recent series have suggested that, in most cases, CMV reactivation does not lead 
      to severe complications and resolves spontaneously with the UC flare and
      discontinuation of immunosuppression. In the present paper, we describe two
      patients with active UC who developed a severe systemic CMV infection during a
      treatment with an oral microemulsion form of cyclosporine. This is of concern,
      particularly in a context of increasing use of immunosuppressive drugs in UC. We 
      propose a prophylactic and curative approach to decrease morbidity related to CMV
      infection in active UC.

TI  - Refeeding syndrome: a potentially fatal condition but remains underdiagnosed and 
      undertreated.
PG  - 604-6
LID - 10.1016/j.nut.2008.01.053 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe two cases of successfully prevented refeeding syndrome in 
      a high-risk group of patients. METHODS: Case 1 was a 70-y-old woman who presented
      with a 4-mo history of poor dietary intake and ill health due to a connective
      tissue disease leading to myositis and dysphagia and complicated by respiratory
      failure needing mechanical ventilation. Twelve hours after starting nasogastric
      tube feeding, she developed a cardiac arrest from which she was successfully
      resuscitated. Repeated attempts to wean her from the ventilator failed. Case 2
      was a 15-y-old girl who was readmitted after a total colectomy for severe
      ulcerative colitis with diarrhea and vomiting leading to significant weight loss.
      Her body mass index was 11.4 kg/m(2). RESULTS: In case 1, after consultation by
      the clinical nutrition team, the diagnosis of refeeding syndrome was made and the
      patient was duly started on a high-protein, high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet,
      multivitamin and trace-element supplements, and electrolyte infusion.
      Subsequently she was successfully weaned from the ventilator. In case 2, further 
      investigation by the clinical nutrition team revealed low baseline electrolyte
      concentrations including potassium, magnesium, calcium, and phosphate and low
      serum albumin. Her low body mass index and baseline electrolyte concentrations
      put her at high risk of developing refeeding syndrome. She was initially started 
      on low-calorie feeding, multivitamin and minerals, and her electrolytes were
      carefully monitored. She made a good recovery. CONCLUSION: Refeeding syndrome is 
      a life-threatening, underdiagnosed, treatable condition but there is a need for a
      wider awareness of the condition among health professionals.

AB  - In approximately one-fourth of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative 
      colitis (UC), disease onset occurs during childhood and adolescence. In addition 
      to gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD), children with these conditions often experience one or more nutritional
      complications of their disease including growth failure, delayed puberty,
      osteoporosis, anemia, and micronutrient deficiencies. This article provides an
      overview of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of
      selected nutritional complications in pediatric IBD.

PG  - 15-21
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2008.03606.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: More than two-thirds of ulcerative colitis patients experience at
      least one relapse over a period of 10 years. Treatments that reduce the
      likelihood of relapses also reduce the risk of long-term complications. AIM: To
      review three topics: the current standard of treatment for ulcerative colitis,
      evolving concepts in treatment, and disease modification as a treatment goal of
      the future. RESULTS: Currently, 5-aminosalicylates are the standard treatment for
      the induction and maintenance of remission in mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis
      patients. Evidence suggests that patients who take oral 5-aminosalicylates
      regularly are nearly six times more likely to experience regression in disease
      severity than those who do not. Additional treatment options such as
      corticosteroids, immunomodulators, biological therapies and ciclosporin are
      available for moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis patients, or those who do not
      respond to 5-aminosalicylate. Surgery becomes pertinent for more than one-third
      of ulcerative colitis patients during the course of their disease. With the
      availability of a variety of therapies, advances in surgery and improved
      management strategies, a better understanding of patient treatment expectations
      can help improve the quality of care for ulcerative colitis patients.
      CONCLUSIONS: Disease modification is increasingly becoming a treatment goal in
      the management of ulcerative colitis. However, long-term studies are needed to
      examine further the disease modifying role of 5-aminosalicylates.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients are at increased risk of
      protein-calorie malnutrition. We sought to determine the prevalence of clinically
      diagnosable malnutrition among those hospitalized for IBD throughout the United
      States and whether this malnutrition influenced health outcomes. METHODS: We
      queried the Nationwide Inpatient Sample between 1998 and 2004 to identify
      admissions for Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) and a
      representative sample of non-IBD discharges. We assessed the prevalence and
      predictors of malnutrition and its association with in-hospital mortality and
      resource utilization. RESULTS: The prevalence of malnutrition was greater in CD
      and UC patients than in non-IBD patients (6.1% and 7.2% versus 1.8%, P < 0.0001).
      The adjusted odds ratio for malnutrition among IBD admissions compared with
      non-IBD admissions was 5.57 [95% confidence interval (CI): 5.29-5.86]. More IBD
      discharges than non-IBD discharges with malnutrition received parenteral
      nutrition (26% versus 6%, P < 0.0001). There was increased likelihood of
      malnutrition among those with fistulizing CD (OR 1.65; 95% CI: 1.50-1.82) and
      among those who had undergone bowel resection (OR 1.37; 95% CI: 1.27-1.48).
      Malnutrition was associated with increased in-hospital mortality 3.49 (95% CI:
      2.89-4.23), length of stay (11.9 days versus 5.8 days, P < 0.00001), and total
      charges ($45,188 versus $20,295, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Clinically apparent
      malnutrition is more frequent among IBD admissions than among non-IBD admissions.
      Its association with greater mortality and resource utilization may reflect more 
      severe underlying disease that can lead to both malnutrition and worse outcomes. 
      Nonetheless, diagnosable malnutrition may serve as a clinical marker of poor IBD 
      prognosis in hospitalized patients.

AB  - The bacterial community, in whole or in part, resident in the bowel of humans is 
      considered to fuel the chronic immune inflammatory conditions characteristic of
      Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Chronic or recurrent pouchitis in
      ulcerative colitis patients is responsive to antibiotic therapy, indicating that 
      bacteria are the etiological agents. Microbiological investigations of the
      bacterial communities in stool or of biopsy-associated bacteria have so far
      failed to reveal conclusively the existence of pathogens or bacterial communities
      of consistently altered composition in IBD patients relative to control subjects.
      Confounding factors need to be eliminated from future studies by using
      better-defined patient populations of newly diagnosed and untreated individuals
      and by improved sampling procedures.

TI  - Guidelines for the management of growth failure in childhood inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 839-49
LID - 10.1002/ibd.20378 [doi]
AB  - Around 1 in 4 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) present in
      childhood, the majority around the time of their pubertal growth spurt. This
      presents challenges over and above those of managing IBD in adults as this period
      is a time of dramatic psychological and physical transition for a child. Growth
      and nutrition are key priorities in the management of adolescents and young
      adults with IBD. Growth failure in IBD is characterized by delayed skeletal
      maturation and a delayed onset of puberty, and is best described in terms of
      height-for-age standard deviation score (Z score) or by variations in growth
      velocity over a period of 3-4 months. Growth failure is common at presentation in
      Crohn's disease (CD), but less common in ulcerative colitis (UC). The etiology of
      growth failure is multifactorial. Principal determinants, however, include the
      inflammatory process per se, with proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1beta,
      IL-6) being directly implicated. Furthermore, poor nutrition and the consequences
      of prolonged corticosteroid use also contribute to the significant reduction in
      final adult height of almost 1 in 5 children. Initially a prompt, where possible 
      steroid-free, induction of remission is indicated. The ideal is then to sustain a
      relapse-free remission until growth is complete, which is often not until early
      adulthood. These goals can often be achieved with a combination of exclusive
      enteral nutrition (EEN) and early use of immunosuppressants. The advent of potent
      and efficacious biological agents considerably improves the range of
      growth-sparing interventions available to children around puberty, although
      well-timed surgery remains another highly effective means of achieving remission 
      and significant catch-up growth. We carried out a systematic review of
      publications to identify the best available evidence for managing growth failure 
      in children with IBD. Despite the paucity of high-quality publications,
      sufficient data were available in the literature to allow practical,
      evidence-based where possible, management guidelines to be formulated. Although
      there is clear evidence that exclusive enteral nutrition achieves mucosal
      healing, its effect on growth has only been assessed at 6 months. In contrast to 
      corticosteroids, EEN has no negative effect on growth. Corticosteroids remain the
      key therapy responsible for medication-induced growth impairment, although the
      use of budesonide in selected patients may minimize the steroid effect on
      dividing growth plates. Immunosuppressants have become a mainstay of treatment in
      children with IBD, and are being used earlier in the disease course than ever
      before. However, there are currently no long-term data reporting better growth
      outcome if these agents are introduced very soon after diagnosis. In comparison, 
      recent data from a large prospective trial of infliximab in children with
      moderate to severe CD suggested significant catch-up growth during the first year
      of regular infusions. The only other intervention that has documented clear
      catch-up growth has been surgical resection. Resection of localized CD, in
      otherwise treatment-resistant children, early in the disease process achieves
      clear catch-up growth within the next 6 months. There are no data available that 
      growth hormone improves final adult height in children with CD. In conjunction
      with expert endocrinological support, pubertal delay, more common in boys, may be
      treated with parenteral testosterone if causing significant psychological
      problems. The optimal management of children and adolescents requires a
      multidisciplinary approach frequently available within the pediatric healthcare
      setting. Dedicated dietetic support, along with nurse-specialist, child
      psychologist, and with closely linked medical and surgical care will likely
      achieve the best possible start for children facing a lifetime of chronic gut
      disease.

TI  - Pre-pouch ileitis after colectomy in paediatric ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 381-3
LID - 10.1111/j.1651-2227.2007.00632.x [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Colectomy and ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) is a potentially
      curative option for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). A rare, postoperative 
      complication is terminal ileitis which has been poorly documented in paediatric
      patients. A search of our paediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) database
      revealed two boys with UC who were resistant to medical therapy. They each
      underwent colectomy with IPAA. One year later, both children represented with
      bloody diarrhoea and weight loss. Several endoscopies and biopsies showed acute
      on chronic mucosal inflammation in the pouch and up to 50 cm into the terminal
      ileum (TI). Biopsies revealed mixed inflammatory infiltrate with no granulomas.
      CONCLUSION: Development of terminal ileitis after colectomy and IPAA can occur in
      children with UC. Although every effort should be made to exclude Crohn's disease
      as a cause of the terminal ileitis, this poorly defined condition should not be
      considered to be against the diagnosis of UC. More research is needed to develop 
      a better understanding of the aetiopathogenesis of this uncommon condition.

TI  - Dietary lipids in early development and intestinal inflammatory disease.
PG  - S188-93
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases are life-long reoccurring inflammatory disorders of
      the gastrointestinal tract and have been increasing in incidence in recent
      decades, notably in the pediatric population. Although genetic predisposition
      remains an important factor, this increased incidence most likely reflects an
      environmental change. One potential contributor to this is the change in dietary 
      fat intake, with dietary intake of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)
      following a similar temporal pattern to the change in inflammatory bowel disease 
      incidence. Dietary n-6 PUFAs comprise a major, modifiable, environmental factor
      known to promote a heightened inflammatory response through a number of pathways,
      including their role as precursors for synthesis of eicosanoids and their
      inhibitory effect on the synthesis of the n-3 PUFAs eicosapentanoic acid and
      docosahexanoic acid. The increase in n-6 PUFA intake affects individuals of all
      ages, with fetal PUFA accretion and infant dietary PUFA intake from breast milk
      reflecting maternal dietary intake. A high level of n-6 PUFA in milk results in
      increased n-6 PUFA in colonic phospholipids and an exaggerated inflammatory
      response to chemically induced colitis. Conversely, during development, a diet
      low in n-6 PUFAs and high in n-3 PUFAs increases colonic n-3 fatty acids,
      attenuates the inflammatory response, and lowers colonic damage. High dietary n-6
      PUFA intake may be an important environmental modifier that contributes to
      inflammatory bowel diseases.

TI  - Severe ulcerative colitis: present medical treatment strategies.
PG  - 447-57
LID - 10.1517/14656566.9.3.447 [doi]
AB  - A total of 15-19% of ulcerative colitis patients have a severe attack at some
      time during their illness. As a consequence of its high associated mortality and 
      morbidity rates, a close collaboration between gastroenterologists and surgeons
      in their management is mandatory, in order to define, as best as possible, the
      timing of surgery (i.e., colectomy) when patients fail to respond to medical
      treatment or worsen despite optimal medical treatment. The first step in medical 
      treatment consists of using intravenous corticosteroids as they have been
      demonstrated to reduce drastically the mortality rates. However, at 1 year
      approximately 25% of patients become corticosteroid dependent and 30% require
      colectomy, which can consistently affect their quality of life. Therefore,
      intravenous ciclosporin has been proposed as a rescue therapy, with a further
      improvement of short-term efficacy and reduction of surgery requirement.
      Nevertheless, its use is associated with a risk of toxicity and intravenous
      ciclosporin is not easy to use in non-specialised centres. In addition, long-term
      studies suggest that colectomy is often only delayed and relapse frequent.
      Consequently, some authors evaluate the potential use of infliximab. Available
      data are encouraging, reporting a significant short-term reduction in colectomy
      rate. Nevertheless, additional trials are required to better define the more
      effective and safe treatment option(s), for both the short- and long-term, in
      this patient setting; a question addressed in ongoing trials.

TI  - Treatment of diarrhea in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: concepts and
      cautions.
PG  - S3-10
AB  - Diarrhea continues to be a prevalent symptom in patients with inflammatory bowel 
      disease (IBD), requiring a wide differential diagnosis to define the
      pathophysiologic mechanisms in individual patients. It is essential that
      physicians properly evaluate complaints of diarrhea by assessing both patient
      symptoms and potential physiologic impacts on fluid and electrolyte status.
      Underlying mechanisms of diarrhea with IBD are the location, extent, and severity
      of inflammation; malabsorption; altered motility; and iatrogenic causes such as
      medications, diet, and antibiotic-associated colitis (eg, Clostridium difficile).
      When treating diarrhea, physicians need to control inflammatory activity using
      appropriate treatment algorithms. Therapies include aminosalicylates,
      corticosteroids, immune modifiers, and, most recently, biologic treatment. Other 
      medications, including loperamide, diphenoxylate, codeine sulfate, and tinctures 
      of opium, slow motility and increase the absorption of fluids and nutrients. For 
      iatrogenic issues, medications that cause diarrhea should be withdrawn and
      individual diets modified. Not all diarrheas in the IBD patient are the same;
      therefore, it is essential to tailor therapies according to presumed etiologies. 
      Antidiarrheal agents are not recommended in extremely ill patients and those with
      known hypersensitivity or evidence of obstruction or colonic dilation, fever, or 
      abdominal tenderness. Concomitant use of loperamide with diphenoxylate and
      atropine should be avoided in early pregnancy.

TI  - Increased faecal serine protease activity in diarrhoeic IBS patients: a colonic
      lumenal factor impairing colonic permeability and sensitivity.
PG  - 591-9
LID - 10.1136/gut.2007.140210 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) is
      characterised by elevated colonic lumenal serine protease activity. The aims of
      this study were (1) to investigate the origin of this elevated serine protease
      activity, (2) to evaluate if it may be sufficient to trigger alterations in
      colonic paracellular permeability (CPP) and sensitivity, and (3) to examine the
      role of the proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) activation and signalling
      cascade in this process. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Faecal enzymatic activities were
      assayed in healthy subjects and patients with IBS, ulcerative colitis and acute
      infectious diarrhoea. Following mucosal exposure to supernatants from control
      subjects and IBS-D patients, electromyographic response to colorectal balloon
      distension was recorded in wild-type and PAR-2(-/-) mice, and CPP was evaluated
      on colonic strips in Ussing chambers. Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and
      phosphorylated myosin light chain were detected by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS:
      The threefold increase in faecal serine protease activity seen in IBS-D patients 
      compared with constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C) or infectious diarrhoea is of 
      neither epithelial nor inflammatory cell origin, nor is it coupled with
      antiprotease activity of endogenous origin. Mucosal application of faecal
      supernatants from IBS-D patients in mice evoked allodynia and increased CPP by
      92%, both of which effects were prevented by serine protease inhibitors and
      dependent on PAR-2 expression. In mice, colonic exposure to supernatants from
      IBS-D patients resulted in a rapid increase in the phosphorylation of myosin
      light chain and delayed redistribution of ZO-1 in colonocytes. CONCLUSIONS:
      Elevated colonic lumenal serine protease activity of IBS-D patients evokes a
      PAR-2-mediated colonic epithelial barrier dysfunction and subsequent allodynia in
      mice, suggesting a novel organic background in the pathogenesis of IBS.

TI  - Serum ghrelin levels in inflammatory bowel disease with relation to disease
      activity and nutritional status.
PG  - 2215-21
AB  - Ghrelin possesses various biological activities -- it stimulates growth hormone
      (GH) release, plays a major role in energy metabolism, and is one of the hormones
      that affects body composition. It also plays a role in modulating immune response
      and inflammatory processes. In this study we aimed to determine whether serum
      ghrelin levels had correlation with markers associated with disease activation.
      We also investigated any probable relationship between serum ghrelin level and
      nutritional status. Serum levels of ghrelin and its relationship with disease
      activity and nutritional status were evaluated in 34 patients with ulcerative
      colitis (UC), 25 patients with Crohn's disease (CD), and 30 healthy controls.
      Serum ghrelin levels, serum IGF-1 and GH levels, and markers of disease activity 
      (sedimentation, C-reactive protein, and fibrinogen) were measured in all
      subjects. Body composition and nutritional status was assessed by both direct (by
      anthropometry) and indirect (by bioimpedance) methods. Serum ghrelin levels were 
      significantly higher in patients with active UC and CD than in those in remission
      (108 +/- 11 pg/ml vs. 71 +/- 13 pg/ml for UC patients, P < 0.001; 110 +/- 10
      pg/ml vs. 75 +/- 15 pg/ml for CD patients, P < 0.001). Circulating ghrelin levels
      in UC and CD patients were positively correlated with sedimentation, fibrinogen
      and CRP and was negatively correlated with IGF-1, BMI, TSFT, MAC, fat mass (%),
      and fat free mass (%). This study demonstrates that patients with active IBD have
      higher serum ghrelin levels than patients in remission and high levels of
      circulating ghrelin correlate with the severity of disease and the activity
      markers. Ghrelin levels in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients show an
      appositive correlation with IGF-1 and bioelectrical impedance analysis, body
      composition, and anthropometric assessments. Finally, we arrived at the
      conclusion that ghrelin level may be important in determination of the activity
      in IBD patients and evaluation of nutritional status.

TI  - Differential clustering of bowel biopsy-associated bacterial profiles of
      specimens collected in Mexico and Canada: what do these profiles represent?
PG  - 111-7
AB  - Bowel commensals appear to be an important source of antigens that drive the
      chronic immune inflammation characteristic of Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis [inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)]. Biopsy-associated bacteria are
      assumed to be particularly relevant in bacteriological investigations of IBD
      because they are assumed to be located on the mucosal surface and hence close to 
      immunological cells. This investigation analysed the bacterial collections
      associated with bowel biopsies, aspirates of residual fluid after bowel cleansing
      and faeces from IBD patients and non-IBD subjects in Edmonton, Canada, and Mexico
      City, Mexico. Temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis of 16S rRNA gene 
      sequences produced profiles of the bacterial collections and their similarities
      were compared. Similarity analysis showed that the profiles did not cluster
      according to disease status, but that Canadian and Mexican profiles could be
      differentiated by this method. Comparison of biopsy, aspirate and faecal samples 
      obtained from the same subject showed that, on average, the profiles were highly 
      similar. Therefore, biopsy-associated bacteria are likely to represent, at least 
      in part, contaminants from the fluid, which resembles a faecal solution, that
      pools in the bowel after cleansing prior to endoscopy.

TI  - Endoscopic imaging: emerging optical techniques for the detection of colorectal
      neoplasia.
PG  - 64-9
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Advances in bioengineering have spawned various imaging
      modalities which have revolutionized endoscopy. Some of these technologies
      provide real-time, high-resolution, subcellular imaging. This review provides an 
      update on these technologies and their role in the evaluation of colorectal
      neoplasia. RECENT FINDINGS: Narrow band imaging has been shown to visualize
      capillary patterns in early cancer and is complementary to magnification
      endoscopy. Optical coherence tomography has been used to evaluate neoplastic
      progression and distinguish Crohn's from ulcerative colitis. Confocal
      endomicroscopy has been shown to accurately predict neoplastic changes in polyps 
      and identify areas of neoplasia in patients with colitis. Among the spectroscopic
      techniques, autofluorescence is best studied in the colon and has been used to
      identify adenomas and dysplasia in inflammatory bowel disease. Endocytoscopy is a
      relatively new technology but shows promise in distinguishing neoplastic lesions.
      SUMMARY: Recently a number of imaging technologies have arisen that have the
      potential to enhance our detection of colorectal neoplasia. Several of these,
      such as autofluorescent imaging and narrow band imaging, are 'red flag'
      techniques which enhance our visualization of mucosal change(s). Complementary
      technologies, such as confocal endomicroscopy and endocytoscopy, provide
      subcellular imaging. Combined with a 'red flag' technique, these may transform
      our approach to colonoscopy, allowing the real-time detection and diagnosis of
      neoplasia.

TI  - Dietary antigens in Crohn's disease: antibodies to porcine pancreatic amylase.
PG  - 656-64
AB  - OBJECTIVES: There is no clear evidence that dietary proteins aggravate Crohn's
      disease (CD). We aimed to clarify the antibody response to dietary proteins in
      CD. METHODS: Antibody to porcine pancreatic amylase (PPA) a protease-resistant
      dietary protein (anti-PPA), was examined in CD patients (N = 104), ulcerative
      colitis (UC) patients (N = 85), and healthy controls (N = 83), and its
      relationship with the clinical characteristics of CD was investigated. Antibodies
      to casein and ovalbumin, anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA), and
      antibodies to I2 from Pseudomonas fluorescens (anti-I2) were also examined.
      RESULTS: Thirty-eight percent (39/104) of the CD patients expressed anti-PPA
      antibodies, and this percentage was significantly higher as compared with the
      control group (5%, 4/83) and the UC group (9%, 8/85) (P < 0.001). A significantly
      higher level of anti-PPA antibodies was detected in patients with "small bowel
      disease-dominant" CD than in those with "colitis-dominant" CD (P < 0.05).
      Antibodies to casein and ovalbumin were not specifically expressed in CD
      patients. As ASCA was detected in 33% and anti-I2 in 46% of the CD patients, 72% 
      of the CD patients were found positive for at least one of the three antibodies
      including anti-PPA antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: CD patients showed a specific
      antibody response to PPA, as compared with UC patients and controls. There was a 
      significantly higher level of anti-PPA antibody in patients with "small bowel
      disease-dominant" CD, suggesting that dietary proteins could play a role in the
      inflammatory response in CD patients with small bowel disease. Anti-PPA
      antibodies combined with ASCA/anti-I2 may be useful for the diagnosis of CD.

TI  - Current treatment of inflammatory bowel disease in children.
PG  - 16-21
AB  - Children with inflammatory bowel disease present formidable therapeutic
      challenges. As both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis remain medically
      incurable conditions associated with potentially significant morbidity, the focus
      of treatment must be to reduce or eliminate symptoms, optimize nutritional
      status, promote normal growth and development, prevent complications and minimize
      the potential psychological effects of these chronic illnesses. This review
      focuses on the evidence supporting the treatments currently used in children with
      inflammatory bowel disease, and suggests potential treatment algorithms for
      particular clinical circumstances.

TI  - Severe paediatric ulcerative colitis: incidence, outcomes and optimal timing for 
      second-line therapy.
PG  - 331-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the predominance of extensive disease in children with
      ulcerative colitis, data concerning severe paediatric ulcerative colitis are
      sparse. We reviewed rates and predictors of response to
      intravenous-corticosteroid therapy in a single-centre cohort with long-term
      follow-up. METHODS: 99 children (49% males; age 2-17 years) were hospitalised
      (1991-2000) for treatment of severe ulcerative colitis (90% extensive; 49% new
      onset ulcerative colitis). Clinical, laboratory and radiographic data were
      reviewed. A population-based subset was used to assess incidence. Predictors of
      corticosteroid response were analysed using univariate and multivariate analyses 
      at days 3 and 5 of therapy. Colectomy rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier
      survival analyses. RESULTS: 28% (95% CI, 23 to 34%) of children with ulcerative
      colitis resident in the Greater Toronto Area required admission for intravenous
      corticosteroid therapy, of whom 53 (53%; 95% CI, 44 to 63%) responded. Several
      predictors were associated with corticosteroid failure, but in multivariable
      modelling only C-reactive protein [OR = 3.5 (1.4 to 8.4)] and number of nocturnal
      stools [OR = 3.2 (1.6 to 6.6)] remained significant at both days 3 and 5. The
      Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI), Travis and Lindgren's
      indices strongly predicted non-response. Radiographically, the upper range of
      colonic luminal width was 40 mm in children younger than 11 years versus 60 mm in
      older patients. Cumulative colectomy rates at discharge, 1 year and 6 years were 
      42%, 58% and 61%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Children with ulcerative colitis
      commonly experience at least one severe exacerbation. Response to intravenous
      corticosteroids is poor. The PUCAI, determined at day 3 (>45 points) should be
      used to screen for patients likely to fail corticosteroids and at day 5 (>70
      points) to dictate the introduction of second-line therapies.

TI  - [Socioeconomic and nutritional profile of patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease at a university hospital].
PG  - 99-106
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases include chronic and relapsing
      inflammatory disorders, represented by ulcerative proctocolitis and Crohns
      disease, commonly associated with malnutrition. AIM: Characterize the nutritional
      and socioeconomic profile of patients hospitalized at the Pernambuco "Hospital
      das Clinicas", Recife, PE, Brazil. METHODS: Cross-sectional study carried out at 
      the gastroenterology clinic, which was previously approved by the Ethics
      Commission for studies involving human beings. The methods included clinical
      history data, socioeconomic conditions and nutritional assessment. Data were
      subject to statistical analysis (Students t test for equal and unequal
      variables). RESULTS: The sample consisted of 24 male and female patients, with a 
      mean age of 43.83 +/- 16.13 years, mostly married, coming from Recife, with low
      income, who lived in their own house with relatives. We found a higher prevalence
      of ulcerative proctocolitis (62.5%), with diagnosis time of more than 5 years,
      symptoms of abdominal pain, bloody-mucous diarrhea with 6-9 evacuations/day, with
      the distal colon being the most affected part. Osteoporosis was present in 26.7% 
      of cases. Nutritional status was assessed through the body mass index. The weight
      loss percentage corresponded to 41.7% and 70.8%, respectively, classified as
      malnourished, associated or not with high prevalence levels of anemia,
      hypoalbuminemia and hypocalcemia. Gender correlation evidenced higher triceps
      fold and arm circumference values in men. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the study
      limitations, data suggest relevant information about the occurrence of these
      diseases in the northeast of Brazil, as well as about its frequent association
      with important nutritional deficiencies.

TI  - Body mass index in children with newly diagnosed inflammatory bowel disease:
      observations from two multicenter North American inception cohorts.
PG  - 523-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of children with newly diagnosed
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) from 2 prospective inception cohorts to examine 
      body mass index (BMI) status at presentation. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical,
      demographic, and BMI data were obtained from 783 patients with newly diagnosed
      IBD. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data for 2748 healthy
      children were used as a control. RESULTS: Most children with Crohn's disease and 
      ulcerative colitis had a BMI in the normative range (5%-84%). Low BMI (<5%) was
      seen in 22% to 24% of children with Crohn's disease and 7% to 9% of children with
      ulcerative colitis. Ten percent of children with Crohn's disease and 20% to 30%
      of children with ulcerative colitis had a BMI at diagnosis consistent with
      overweight or risk for overweight. CONCLUSION: Children with IBD are affected by 
      current population trends toward overweight. A significant subgroup of children
      with newly diagnosed IBD has a BMI categorized as overweight or at risk for
      overweight. Clinicians should be aware of possible IBD diagnosis in the presence 
      increased BMI.

      materials of the European Association of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition)].
PG  - 92-8, 129
AB  - The present article gives evidence-based recommendations for the indication,
      application and type of formula of enteral nutrition (EN) (oral nutrition
      supplements (ONS) or tube feeding (TF)) in patients with Crohn's disease (CD),
      ulcerative colitis (UC), short bowel syndrome (SBS), acute and chronic
      pancreatitis, alcoholic steatogepatitis and cirrosis. ONS and/or TF in addition
      to normal food is indicates in undernourished patients with CD or UC to improve
      nutritional status. In active CD EN is the first line therapy in children and
      should be used as sole therapy in adults mainly when treatment with
      corticosteroids is not feasible. No significant differences have been shown in
      the effects of free amino acid, peptide-based and hole protein formulae for TF.
      In remission ONS is recommended only in steroid dependent patients in CD. In
      patients with SBS TF should be introduced in the adaptation phase and should be
      changed with progressing adaptation to ONS in addition to normal food. Special
      nutrition support should not be used routinely in patients with mild or moderate 
      acute pancreatitis. EN is the preffered route in patients with pancreatitis and
      should be attempted before initiating parenteral nutrition. Nutrition assessment 
      in patients with liver disease should include screening for micronutrient
      deficiencies. Protein restriction should be implemented for the acute management 
      of hepatic encephalopathy and should not be implemented chronically in patients
      with liver disease.

TI  - The utilization of parenteral nutrition during the in-patient management of
      inflammatory bowel disease in the United States: a national survey.
PG  - 1499-507
AB  - BACKGROUND: Parenteral nutrition has a limited role in the in-patient management 
      of inflammatory bowel disease. AIM: To determine nationwide patterns of
      in-patient parenteral nutrition utilization and its demographic determinants and 
      impact on outcomes. METHODS: We identified inflammatory bowel disease discharges 
      in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample between 1998 and 2003 and determined rates of 
      parenteral nutrition utilization among US census regions, in-hospital mortality
      and hospital resource utilization. RESULTS: The parenteral nutrition utilization 
      rate among hospitalized inflammatory bowel disease patients was 6%. Only 64% of
      Crohn's disease and 55% of ulcerative colitis discharges who received parenteral 
      nutrition had malnutrition, fistulizing or obstructive Crohn's disease, or
      surgery as an indication. The adjusted odds ratio of receiving parenteral
      nutrition were 0.36 (95% CI: 0.26-0.51) for the mid-west, 0.47 (0.37-0.56) for
      the south and 0.70 (0.56-0.89) for the west, compared to the north-east. Use of
      parenteral nutrition was associated with higher in-hospital mortality (OR 2.5;
      95% CI: 1.93-3.24), length of stay (13.7 vs. 5.7 days, P < 0.001) and hospital
      charges ($51,729 vs. $19,563, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In-patient utilization of 
      parenteral nutrition for inflammatory bowel disease varies markedly by census
      region, expends significant resources, and leads to potentially significant
      adverse outcomes. These findings underscore the need for guidelines for judicious
      parenteral nutrition use in inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Return to competition following ischemic colitis caused by severe dehydration.
PG  - 271-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This article summarizes a case of ischemic colitis suffered by a
      triathlete during an Ironman competition. BACKGROUND: Exercise results in a
      significant reduction in splanchnic blood flow to help maintain cardiovascular
      function. When dehydration and heat stress accompany exercise, blood flow to the 
      splanchnic vasculature is further reduced, increasing the risk of local ischemia 
      and tissue injury. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: Ischemic colitis caused by dehydration
      and heat stress. TREATMENT: Right hemicolectomy involving a 16-cm segment of
      ischemic large intestine and appendectomy the day following the race. UNIQUENESS:
      This case study highlights one of the risks associated with dehydration during
      prolonged exercise in the heat. Of particular interest are practical
      interventions to reduce health and performance issues. CONCLUSIONS: Poor
      hydration and nutrition practices during intense exercise can affect gut
      function, impair performance, and jeopardize health. Optimal intake of fluid,
      carbohydrate, and salt will enhance performance and reduce risk to health.

TI  - Diarrheal diseases in the elderly.
PG  - 833-56, vii
AB  - Diarrhea in the elderly population is one disease that needs special attention in
      treatment and management, especially in acute- and long-term care residents,
      because of their multiple comorbidities, immunosenescence, frailty, and poor
      nutritional status. Close follow-up to ensure adequate hydration and electrolyte 
      replacement and infection control measures to contain outbreaks should be
      emphasized to caregivers and nursing staff in acute- and long-term care
      facilities. Although C difficile colitis causes significant morbidity and
      mortality in this population, judicious use of antibiotics is important to
      decrease the incidence and recurrence of the disease. When the diarrhea is
      chronic and all stool testings and serologies have been performed, the patient
      may benefit from endoscopy and colonoscopy for biopsy. Attentive and vigilant
      nursing staff is crucial in the timely diagnosis and treatment of diarrheal
      diseases to improve quality of life and reduce mortality.

TI  - Impact of sleep disturbances in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1748-53
AB  - BACKGROUND: Normal sleep is paramount for a healthy lifestyle and high quality of
      life. Sleep modulates the immune system and thus affects the course of several
      chronic inflammatory conditions. There are no reported studies that address the
      role of sleep disturbance in the course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The 
      aim of this study was to characterize sleep disturbance in IBD using validated
      measures of sleep and quality of life. METHODS: A self-administered, mail-in
      questionnaire package was sent to 205 subjects after a brief instruction. The
      questionnaire package was composed of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), 
      a measure of disease severity and the IBD-Quality of Life Questionnaire. A total 
      of 119 subjects were recruited (58% response rate): 80 with inactive IBD, 24 with
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and 15 healthy controls. RESULTS: The IBD subjects
      reported significantly prolonged sleep latency, frequent sleep fragmentation,
      higher rate of using sleeping pills, decreased day-time energy, increased
      tiredness and poor overall sleep quality compared to healthy controls. The
      abnormal sleep patterns in IBD subjects were similar to IBS subjects. The
      reported sleep quality was correlated with IBD disease severity score (r(2) =
      0.55, P = 0.02). Both IBD and IBS subjects thought that sleep and their disease
      status were correlated. CONCLUSION: The results show that IBD patients have
      significant sleep disturbance even when their disease is not active. This problem
      might affect quality of life, gastrointestinal symptoms and coping ability, and
      might potentially modify disease severity or increase risk of flare-up.
      Regardless of the primary or secondary origin of this problem, sleep disturbance 
      should be addressed in the clinical management of patients with IBD.

TI  - The prevalence and geographic distribution of Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis in the United States.
PG  - 1424-9
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Previous US studies of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      prevalence have sampled small, geographically restricted populations and may not 
      be generalizable to the entire nation. This study sought to determine the
      prevalence of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) in a large
      national sample and to compare the prevalence across geographic regions and other
      sociodemographic characteristics. METHODS: We analyzed the health insurance
      claims for 9 million Americans, pooled from 87 health plans in 33 states, and
      identified cases of CD and UC using diagnosis codes. Prevalence was determined by
      dividing the number of cases by the number of persons enrolled for 2 years.
      Logistic regression was used to compare prevalence estimates by geographic
      region, age, sex, and insurance type (Medicaid vs commercial). RESULTS: The
      prevalence of CD and UC in children younger than 20 years was 43 (95% confidence 
      interval [CI], 40-45) and 28 (95% CI, 26-30) per 100,000, respectively. In
      adults, the prevalence of CD and UC was 201 (95% CI, 197-204) and 238 (95% CI,
      234-241), respectively. The prevalence of both conditions was lower in the South,
      compared with the Northeast, Midwest, and West. IBD appears to be more common in 
      commercially insured individuals, compared with those insured by Medicaid.
      CONCLUSIONS: This estimation of the prevalence of IBD in the US should help
      quantify the overall burden of disease and inform the planning of appropriate
      clinical services.

TI  - Successful pregnancy following partial pancreatectomy after complications from a 
      laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding.
PG  - 457-63
AB  - Each year, increasing numbers of bariatric surgeries are being performed to
      reduce health risks related to obesity. The improvement in health for these
      patients has promoted an increase in the possibility of pregnancy for some woman.
      Because there are lifelong adjustments and the possibility of unique
      complications from bariatric surgery, pregnancy presents special nursing
      concerns. Very few cases have been identified in nursing literature discussing
      pregnancy after complications following a bariatric surgery. This article
      presents a successful pregnancy after a partial pancreatectomy was performed
      secondary to acute pancreatitis and ischemic enterocolitis as a complication of
      laparoscopic gastric banding.

AB  - A 11-years old cyclosporin-treated girl with nephrotic syndrome, complicated by
      severe toxic diarrhoea with excessive metabolic alkalosis and dyselektrolitemia
      (hyponatremia, hypokaliemia, hypochloremia) and transient immunoglobulin
      deficiency is reported. Ultrasonography shows thickeness of the colonic wall as a
      symptom of colonic inflammation. After discontinuation of cyclosporin therapy,
      excluding infectious origin of diarrhoea (bacterial, viral and fungal infection),
      partial parenteral nutrition, enteral nutrition (Peptisorb), probiotics and
      antidiarrhoeal drugs were used in the treatment. After introducing steroids
      orally (Entocort) complete resolution of symptoms were observed.

TI  - Resting energy expenditure in children with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 342-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: There is controversy in the literature regarding the effect of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on resting energy expenditure (REE). In many
      cases this may have resulted from inappropriate adjustment of REE measurements to
      account for differences in body composition. This article considers how to
      appropriately adjust measurements of REE for differences in body composition
      between individuals with IBD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Body composition, assessed
      via total body potassium to yield a measure of body cell mass (BCM), and REE
      measurements were performed in 41 children with Crohn disease and ulcerative
      colitis in the Royal Children's Hospital, Brisbane, Australia. Log-log regression
      was used to determine the power function to which BCM should be raised to
      appropriately adjust REE to account for differences in body composition between
      children. RESULTS: The appropriate value to "adjust" BCM was found to be 0.49,
      with a standard error of 0.10. CONCLUSIONS: Clearly, there is a need to adjust
      for differences in body composition, or at the very least body weight, in
      metabolic studies in children with IBD. We suggest that raising BCM to the power 
      of 0.5 is both a numerically convenient and a statistically valid way of
      achieving this aim. Under circumstances in which the measurement of BCM is not
      available, raising body weight to the power of 0.5 remains appropriate. The
      important issue of whether REE is changed in cases of IBD can then be
      appropriately addressed.

TI  - Oral tacrolimus for steroid-dependent and steroid-resistant ulcerative colitis in
      children.
PG  - 306-11
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate tacrolimus in 3 situations: for the induction of remission
      in children with severe steroid-resistant ulcerative colitis (UC); for steroid
      sparing in children with steroid-dependent UC in whom treatment with other
      immunosuppressants fails; and for the maintenance of remission in children with
      steroid-dependent and steroid-resistant UC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We
      retrospectively evaluated 18 consecutive patients (13 with pancolitis) who were
      treated with oral tacrolimus at our institution from May 1999 to October 2005.
      Nine patients had steroid-resistant UC and 9 patients were steroid-dependent. We 
      started patients initially on tacrolimus 0.2 mg/kg divided twice daily, with a
      goal plasma trough level of 10 to 15 ng/mL for the first 2 weeks, and then
      titrated doses to achieve plasma levels between 7 and 12 ng/mL after induction.
      RESULTS: Of the 18 patients in this study, 17 showed a positive response to
      tacrolimus therapy (ie, cessation of diarrhea and other symptoms) and 5 showed a 
      prolonged response to tacrolimus. The mean time from initiation of tacrolimus
      therapy until response was 8.5 days. The mean duration of response was 260 days. 
      Eleven of 18 patients required colectomy, including all of the patients with
      steroid-resistant UC, but only 2 of 9 who were steroid-dependent. The mean time
      from initiation of tacrolimus until colectomy was 392 days. CONCLUSIONS: It is
      possible that tacrolimus may benefit selected patients with steroid-dependent UC,
      including those who are intolerant of 6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine.
      Conversely, patients with steroid-resistant UC are unlikely to sustain a
      prolonged clinical response to tacrolimus and seem to require colectomy
      eventually. Careful considerations of risk versus benefit, as well as close
      monitoring for adverse effects, are essential in all patients.

TI  - Has toll-like receptor 4 been prematurely dismissed as an inflammatory bowel
      disease gene? Association study combined with meta-analysis shows strong evidence
      for association.
PG  - 2504-12
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Published association studies of the TLR4 Asp299Gly polymorphism and 
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in caucasian populations have inconsistent
      results. We tested two TLR4 variants for association with IBD in the New Zealand 
      caucasian population and assessed the cumulative evidence for association of TLR4
      Asp299Gly and IBD. METHODS: The TLR4 Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile polymorphisms were
      genotyped and tested for case-control frequency differences in a New Zealand
      white cohort of 389 Crohn's disease (CD) patients, 405 ulcerative colitis (UC)
      patients, and 416 population controls. Meta-analysis using a random effects model
      was performed to test whether 299Gly carriage was associated with UC, CD, or
      phenotypes of CD patients. RESULTS: There were no significant allele or genotype 
      frequency differences between cases and controls or between CD phenotypes in our 
      New Zealand data. Meta-analysis did not identify any significant associations
      between CD phenotypes and 299Gly carriage. However, meta-analysis demonstrated
      significantly higher 299Gly carrier frequencies in CD patients (odds ratio 1.45, 
      95% CI 1.11-1.90) and in IBD patients (odds ratio 1.36, 95% CI 1.01-1.84)
      compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis provides evidence that
      Asp299Gly is associated with CD and IBD in whites. Only the Asp299Gly
      polymorphism has been consistently genotyped in previous TLR4 studies with IBD
      patients, therefore other TLR4 variants with stronger associations with IBD may
      exist. Additional well-powered studies of Asp299Gly and other TLR4 variants are
      urgently needed.

TI  - Aluminum is a potential environmental factor for Crohn's disease induction:
      extended hypothesis.
PG  - 329-45
AB  - Aluminum (Al) is a common environmental compound with immune-adjuvant activity
      and granulomatous inflammation inducer. Al exposure in food, additives, air,
      pharmaceuticals, and water pollution is ubiquitous in Western culture. Crohn's
      disease (CD) is a chronic relapsing intestinal inflammation in genetically
      susceptible individuals and is influenced by yet unidentified environmental
      factors. It is hypothesized, in the present review, that Al is a potential factor
      for induction or maintaining the inflammation in CD. Epidemiologically, CD
      incidence is higher in urban areas, where microparticle pollution is prevalent.
      Al immune activities share many characteristics with the immune pathology of CD: 
      increased antigen presentation and APCs activation, many luminal bacterial or
      dietary compounds can be adsorbed to the metal and induce Th1 profile activity,
      promotion of humoral and cellular immune responses, proinflammatory, apoptotic,
      oxidative activity, and stress-related molecule expression enhancement, affecting
      intestinal bacterial composition and virulence, granuloma formation, colitis
      induction in an animal model of CD, and terminal ileum uptake. The Al-bacterial
      interaction, the microparticles homing the intestine together with the extensive 
      immune activity, put Al as a potential environmental candidate for CD induction
      and maintenance.

TI  - Acute graft versus host disease.
PG  - 35
AB  - Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurs after allogeneic hematopoietic stem
      cell transplant and is a reaction of donor immune cells against host tissues.
      Activated donor T cells damage host epithelial cells after an inflammatory
      cascade that begins with the preparative regimen. About 35%-50% of hematopoietic 
      stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients will develop acute GVHD. The exact risk is
      dependent on the stem cell source, age of the patient, conditioning, and GVHD
      prophylaxis used. Given the number of transplants performed, we can expect about 
      5500 patients/year to develop acute GVHD. Patients can have involvement of three 
      organs: skin (rash/dermatitis), liver (hepatitis/jaundice), and gastrointestinal 
      tract (abdominal pain/diarrhea). One or more organs may be involved. GVHD is a
      clinical diagnosis that may be supported with appropriate biopsies. The reason to
      pursue a tissue biopsy is to help differentiate from other diagnoses which may
      mimic GVHD, such as viral infection (hepatitis, colitis) or drug reaction
      (causing skin rash). Acute GVHD is staged and graded (grade 0-IV) by the number
      and extent of organ involvement. Patients with grade III/IV acute GVHD tend to
      have a poor outcome. Generally the patient is treated by optimizing their
      immunosuppression and adding methylprednisolone. About 50% of patients will have 
      a solid response to methylprednisolone. If patients progress after 3 days or are 
      not improved after 7 days, they will get salvage (second-line) immunosuppressive 
      therapy for which there is currently no standard-of-care. Well-organized clinical
      trials are imperative to better define second-line therapies for this disease.
      Additional management issues are attention to wound infections in skin GVHD and
      fluid/nutrition management in gastrointestinal GVHD. About 50% of patients with
      acute GVHD will eventually have manifestations of chronic GVHD.

TI  - Collagenous colitis and eosinophilic gastritis in a 4-year old girl: a case
      report and review of the literature.
PG  - 1365-7
AB  - UNLABELLED: Collagenous colitis (CC), a form of microscopic colitis, is
      characterized by a thick subepithelial collagen layer in the colon in the
      presence of chronic nonbloody watery diarrhoea and macroscopically
      normal-appearing colonic mucosa. Typically affecting elderly adults, CC is rare
      in children with only 12 cases previously reported in the literature. We report
      the case of a 4-year-old girl with CC associated with eosinophilic gastritis,
      which was clinically responsive to treatment with ketotifen, a
      benzocycloheptathiophene derivative, and H(1) class of antihistamine that
      stabilizes mast cells and potentially impairs eosinophil migration to target
      organs. We review the published cases of paediatric-onset CC and summarize the
      links between eosinophils and CC in the clinical and basic science literature.
      CONCLUSION: CC is a rare cause of chronic diarrhoea in children and may relate to
      mast cell and eosinophil activity.

TI  - Assessment of dietary intake and trace element status in patients with ileal
      pouch-anal anastomosis.
PG  - 1553-7
AB  - PURPOSE: Panproctocolectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is the operation of 
      choice for patients with ulcerative colitis and familial polyposis. The long-term
      nutritional consequences after pouch surgery are unknown. We have assessed the
      nutritional status of the essential trace elements-zinc, copper, manganese, and
      selenium-in patients several years (median, 10 (range, 2-15) years) after
      surgery. METHODS: Fifty-five patients with uncomplicated ileal pouch-anal
      anastomosis and 46 healthy control subjects were studied. A dietary assessment of
      trace element intake was undertaken by using a semiquantitative food frequency
      questionnaire. The patients' trace elements status for zinc, copper, manganese,
      and selenium was assessed by measuring their concentrations in blood. RESULTS:
      The dietary intake of individual trace elements was similar in both groups (all P
      values > 0.4). There was no significant difference in the concentrations of
      plasma copper, zinc, and selenium between patients and healthy control subjects
      (all P values > 0.07). The concentration of whole blood manganese was
      significantly higher (P = 0.004) in patients (median, 178.5 nmol/l; range, 59-478
      nmol/l) compared with healthy control subjects (median, 140 nmol/l; range, 53-267
      nmol/l). Four (7 percent) patients had manganese concentrations more than three
      standard deviations of the mean of control group (>255 nmol/l). CONCLUSIONS: This
      study shows that patients who have had uncomplicated pouch surgery have a normal 
      dietary intake of trace elements and do not develop deficiencies in copper, zinc,
      manganese, and selenium. However, these patients may be at increased risk of
      manganese toxicity.

TI  - Mucosal T-cell immunoregulation varies in early and late inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 1696-705
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Crohn's disease is a life-long form of inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) mediated by mucosal immune abnormalities. Understanding of the
      pathogenesis is limited because it is based on data from adults with chronic
      Crohn's disease. We investigated mucosal T-cell immunoregulatory events in
      children with early Crohn's disease. METHODS: Mucosal biopsies and T-cell clones 
      were derived from children experiencing the first attack of Crohn's disease,
      children with long-standing Crohn's disease, infectious colitis, and children
      without gut inflammation. RESULTS: As in acute infectious colitis, interleukin
      (IL) 12 induced T cells from early Crohn's disease to acquire a strongly
      polarised T helper (Th) type 1 response characterised by high IFN-gamma
      production and IL12Rbeta2 chain expression. Th1 polarisation was not induced in
      clones from late Crohn's disease. Mucosal levels of IL12p40 and IL12Rbeta2
      messenger RNA were significantly higher in children with early than late Crohn's 
      disease. These results demonstrate that susceptibility to IL12-mediated
      modulation is strongly dependent on the stage of Crohn's disease. CONCLUSIONS: At
      the onset of Crohn's disease mucosal T cells appear to mount a typical Th1
      response that resembles an acute infectious process, and is lost with progression
      to late Crohn's disease. This suggests that mucosal T-cell immunoregulation
      varies with the course of human IBD. Patients with the initial manifestations of 
      IBD may represent an ideal population in which immunomodulation may have optimal 
      therapeutic efficacy.

TI  - Development, validation, and evaluation of a pediatric ulcerative colitis
      activity index: a prospective multicenter study.
PG  - 423-32
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Colonoscopic appearance, the primary measure of disease
      activity in adult ulcerative colitis, is less acceptable to children. Our aim was
      to develop a noninvasive activity index of pediatric ulcerative colitis. METHODS:
      Item selection was performed judgmentally using a Delphi group of 36 experts in
      pediatric inflammatory bowel disease. Item weighting was performed by regression 
      modeling using a prospective cohort of 157 pediatric ulcerative colitis patients.
      Validation was assessed on a separate prospective cohort of 48 children with
      ulcerative colitis undergoing complete colonoscopy. Responsiveness was evaluated 
      at a follow-up visit of 75 children using effect size statistics and diagnostic
      utility approaches. RESULTS: A list of 41 items was generated and reduced to 11
      by rank order. Two physicians completed the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity
      Index (PUCAI) on each of the patients in the weighting cohort. Six clinical items
      were significant in the regression analysis; the laboratory items and an
      endoscopic appearance item did not improve the PUCAI performance. In the
      validation cohort, the PUCAI was highly correlated with the Physician's Global
      Assessment (r = 0.91, P < .001), Mayo score (r = 0.95, P < .001), and
      colonoscopic appearance (r = 0.77, P < .001). Correlations were higher than 2
      noninvasive adult indices calculated concurrently. Interobserver and test-retest 
      reliability were excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.95; 95% CI:
      0.93-0.97). Cut-off points were established using receiver operator
      characteristic curves on the full cohort. Excellent responsiveness was found at
      repeated visits (effect size = 1.9, area under the receiver operator
      characteristic curve = 0.97). CONCLUSIONS: The rigorously developed PUCAI is a
      noninvasive, valid, highly reliable, and responsive index with which to assess
      disease activity in pediatric ulcerative colitis.

TI  - LRH-1-mediated glucocorticoid synthesis in enterocytes protects against
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 13098-103
AB  - Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) is a nuclear receptor involved in intestinal
      lipid homeostasis and cell proliferation. Here we show that haploinsufficiency of
      LRH-1 predisposes mice to the development of intestinal inflammation. Besides the
      increased inflammatory response, LRH-1 heterozygous mice exposed to
      2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid show lower local corticosterone production as
      a result of an impaired intestinal expression of the enzymes CYP11A1 and CYP11B1,
      which control the local synthesis of corticosterone in the intestine. Local
      glucocorticoid production is strictly enterocyte-dependent because it is robustly
      reduced in epithelium-specific LRH-1-deficient mice. Consistent with these
      findings, colon biopsies of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis 
      show reduced expression of LRH-1 and genes involved in the production of
      glucocorticoids. Hence, LRH-1 regulates intestinal immunity in response to
      immunological stress by triggering local glucocorticoid production. These
      findings underscore the importance of LRH-1 in the control of intestinal
      inflammation and the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Functional fermented milk products.
PG  - 235-47; discussion 247-50
AB  - Fermented foods have been used since prehistoric times. Their number, variety and
      geographic origin are considerable, and different substrates and agents including
      bacteria, yeasts and moulds have been used in their preparation. In the last few 
      decades the scientific approach to the study of the participating microorganisms 
      and the resulting products have provided a better understanding of their
      biological importance. Among the many health-related properties of fermented
      foods, effects on blood pressure have been described after casein hydrolysis by
      lactic acid bacteria. Peptides with antimicrobial activity, mainly against
      Gram-negative bacteria, and derived from casein have also been identified. This
      could explain, at least in part, the antidiarrheal effects of fermented products 
      including those on traveler's diarrhea and against colonization by Helicobacter
      pylori. One of the best known advantages of fermented milk products is their
      capacity to improve lactose tolerance in hypolactasic subjects. With the growing 
      prevalence of allergies and inflammatory bowel diseases, considerable interest
      has been focused on the effects of lactic acid bacteria in these conditions;
      there is evidence that these agents are associated with improvements in allergy; 
      no such evidence exists for Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. A
      cholesterol-lowering capacity has also been described for some microorganisms.
      Not all the fermenting microorganisms have probiotic capacities as the latter are
      strain-specific.

TI  - Evidence for the use of probiotics and prebiotics in inflammatory bowel disease: 
      a review of clinical trials.
PG  - 307-15
AB  - Human subjects and their enteric microbiota have evolved together to reach a
      state of mutual tolerance. Mounting evidence from both animal models and human
      studies suggests that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents a malfunction
      of this relationship. The enteric microecology therefore represents an attractive
      therapeutic target with few side effects. Probiotics and prebiotics have been
      investigated in clinical trials as treatments for IBD, with conflicting results. 
      The evidence for the use of probiotics in the management of pouchitis is
      persuasive and several studies indicate their effectiveness in ulcerative
      colitis. Trials of probiotics and prebiotics in Crohn's disease are less
      convincing. However, methodologies vary widely and a range of probiotic,
      prebiotic and combination (synbiotic) treatments have been tested in a variety of
      patient groups with an assortment of end points. Conclusions about any one
      treatment in a specific patient group can therefore only be drawn on evidence
      from relatively small numbers of patients. The present article reviews the role
      of the intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBD and addresses the
      clinical evidence for the therapeutic manipulation of bowel microbiota using
      probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics in IBD.

TI  - Omega 3 fatty acids (fish oil) for maintenance of remission in ulcerative
      colitis.
PG  - CD006443
AB  - BACKGROUND: Omega-3 fatty acids (n-3, fish oil) have been shown to have
      anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, n-3 therapy may be beneficial in chronic
      inflammatory disorders such as ulcerative colitis. OBJECTIVES: To systematically 
      review the efficacy and safety of n-3 for maintaining remission in ulcerative
      colitis (UC). SEARCH STRATEGY: The following databases were searched from their
      inception without language restriction: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
      Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Healthstar, PubMed, and ACP journal club. Experts were
      contacted for unpublished data. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized placebo-controlled
      trials (RCT) of fish oil for maintenance of remission in UC were included.
      Studies must have enrolled patients (of any age group) who were in remission at
      the time of recruitment, and were followed for at least six months. The
      intervention must have been fish oil given in pre-defined dosage.
      Co-interventions were allowed only if they were balanced between the study
      groups. The primary outcome was relapse rate and the secondary outcome was
      frequency of adverse events. Other outcomes to assess efficacy were change in
      disease activity scores and time to first relapse. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: 
      Two independent investigators reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted the
      data and assessed study quality. Meta-analysis weighted by the Mantel-Haenszel
      method was performed using RevMan 4.2.8 software. Random or fixed effect models
      were used according to degree of heterogeneity and subgroup analyses were
      performed to explore heterogeneity. A sensitivity analysis was performed
      excluding a study of questionable quality . MAIN RESULTS: The three studies that 
      were included used different formulation and dosing of n-3 but none used enteric 
      coated capsules. The pooled analysis showed a similar relapse rate in the n-3
      treated patients and controls (RR 1.02; 95% CI 0.51 to 2.03; P = 0.96). Combining
      the studies resulted in virtually no statistical heterogeneity (P = 0.93, I(2) = 
      0%). Various subgroup and sensitivity analyses showed similar results. However,
      the total number of patients enrolled in these studies was small (n = 138). No
      significant adverse events were recorded in any of the studies and not enough
      data were available to pool the other secondary outcomes for meta-analysis.
      AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: No evidence was found that supports the use of omega 3
      fatty acids for maintenance of remission in UC. Further studies using enteric
      coated capsules may be justified.

TI  - Dietary intake, neutrophil fatty acid profile, serum antioxidant vitamins and
      oxygen radical absorbance capacity in patients with ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 153-9
AB  - Nutrition may play an important role in the pathogenesis and treatment of
      ulcerative colitis. Several studies suggest an association between dietary
      factors and the onset of ulcerative colitis; however, only few studies have
      examined the relationship between dietary intake and relapse of ulcerative
      colitis. The aim of this study was to assess the dietary intake and antioxidative
      capacity of ulcerative colitis patients and to elucidate the efficacy of dietary 
      therapy for ulcerative colitis. Dietary intake, fatty acid composition of
      phospholipids in plasma and neutrophils, serum fat-soluble vitamin levels, and
      oxygen radical absorbance capacity were analyzed in 29 ulcerative colitis
      patients (7 males and 22 females), who were treated at the Department of
      Gastroenterology, Okayama University Hospital. Total fat intake, fat energy ratio
      and linoleic acid intake were significantly lower, while protein and carbohydrate
      intakes were significantly higher, in the patients than age- and sex-matched
      controls. In the neutrophil phospholipids of ulcerative colitis patients,
      significantly higher levels of linoleic aicd and arachidonic acid and a lower
      level of eicosapentaenoic acid were observed. The concentrations of serum retinol
      and beta-carotene but not alpha-tocopherol were significantly lower and serum
      oxygen radical absorbance capacity was also lower than in the controls.
      Significant correlations between serum oxygen radical absorbance capacity and
      retinol (r = 0.567, p = 0.0031), alpha-tocopherol (r = 0.560, p = 0.0036) and
      beta-carotene (r = 0.440, p = 0.0279) concentrations were observed in the
      ulcerative colitis patients. A diet restricting the intake of linoleic acid and
      supplemented with eicosapentaenoic acid and antioxidative vitamins may be
      recommendable for the nutritional management of ulcerative colitis patients.

TI  - Protein-tyrosine phosphatase sigma is associated with ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1212-8
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a relatively common chronic debilitating
      intestinal illness, is composed of two broadly defined groups, Crohn's disease
      (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Although several susceptibility genes for CD
      have been recently described, susceptibility genes exclusive for UC have not been
      forthcoming. Here, we show that receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase sigma
      (PTPRS-encoding PTPsigma) knockout mice spontaneously develop mild colitis that
      becomes severe when challenged with two known inducers of colitis. We also
      demonstrate that E-cadherin and beta-catenin, two important adherens junction
      proteins involved in maintenance of barrier defense in the colon, act as colonic 
      substrates for PTPsigma. Furthermore, we show that three SNPs (rs886936, rs17130,
      and rs8100586) that flank exon 8 in the human PTPRS gene are associated with UC. 
      The presence of these SNPs is associated with novel splicing that removes the
      third immunoglobulin-like domain (exon 9) from the extracellular portion of
      PTPsigma, possibly altering dimerization or ligand recognition. We propose that
      polymorphisms in the human PTPRS gene lead to ulcerative colitis.

PG  - 77-81
AB  - The present study was initiated to examine whether the concentration of CO in the
      breath is elevated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
      Twenty-three clinically stable patients with IBD in the outpatient clinic (11
      with Crohn's disease, 12 with ulcerative colitis), who are non-smokers and
      non-passive smokers, were selected and the concentration of CO in their breath
      was measured using a breath gas analyser (TRI lyser mBA-3000). The concentration 
      of CO in the breath of 23 patients with IBD was 2.5+/-0.9 (1.1-4.3) ppm. This
      concentration comes within the range of standard values in our previous reports
      (2.5+/-2.2 ppm). Any significant difference was not observed between 2.4+/-0.9
      (1.5-4.3) ppm for the 11 Crohn's disease patients and the 2.6+/-1.0 (1.1-3.9) ppm
      for the 12 ulcerative colitis patients. The results suggest that clinically
      stable patients with IBD do not show high values for concentration of CO in the
      breath.

TI  - Surgical management of Crohn's colitis.
PG  - 178-84
AB  - Crohn's disease in childhood is changing. The incidence is increasing, colonic
      disease is becoming more prevalent in younger children, and colon reconstruction 
      is more acceptable. Genetic phenotypes are influencing decisions for surgery, and
      targeted immunotherapy has renewed hope for more durable remissions following
      less extensive resections. The tasks facing the surgeon evaluating a child with
      Crohn's colitis include confirming the specific diagnostic subtype and selecting 
      the correct procedure. This chapter will review the unique aspects of pediatric
      Crohn's colitis and the increased complexity of surgical choice for this most
      challenging presentation. Recent success with less extensive surgery offers
      renewed hope for children with intractable colonic disease.

TI  - [Current status of inflammatory bowel disease treatment].
PG  - 298-300
AB  - Treatment of inflammatory bowel disease should take some general considerations
      into account, standing out among them the importance of nutrition, antithrombotic
      prophylaxis in certain situations, prevention of osteoporosis and prevention of
      colorectal cancer by endoscopic screening in extensive ulcerous colitis or
      Crohn's colitis. Ulcerous colitis is still effectively treated with salicylates
      and steroids in its mild and moderate forms. Severe forms require parenteral
      steroids, cyclosporine or infliximab, and these are successfully used with
      immunosuppressants (azathioprine or mercaptopurine) in steroid dependence.
      Maintenance with salicylates, that should be adequately complied with, is an
      important point. Crohn's disease is treated with steroids in its mild and
      moderate forms, and again in corticodependent ones with immunosuppressants, which
      we are using increasingly sooner. Refractory forms or fistulous forms benefit
      from the use of biological treatments (infliximab) generally accompanied by
      immunosuppressants.

TI  - Biologic therapy in the management of extraintestinal manifestations of
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1424-9
AB  - The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), notably Crohn's disease (CD) and
      ulcerative colitis (UC), are systemic inflammatory diseases primarily involving
      the gastrointestinal tract. Twenty percent to 40% of patients with IBD develop
      extraintestinal inflammation and symptoms, known as extraintestinal
      manifestations (EIMs).1-7 The most common EIMs affect the joints, skin, eyes, and
      biliary tract. The EIMs associated with IBD bear a negative impact on patients
      with UC and CD. Thus, the successful treatment of EIMs is essential for improving
      the quality of life of IBD patients. For most EIMs, their resolution often
      parallels that of the active IBD in both timing and therapy required. However,
      some EIM such as axial arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, uveitis, and primary
      sclerosing cholangitis run a clinical course independent of IBD disease activity.
      The advent of biologic response modifiers, e.g., tumor necrosis factor-alpha
      (TNF) inhibitors, has improved the treatment of IBD and its associated EIMs. This
      article reviews the therapeutic experiences of the 2 most widely used anti-TNF
      neutralizing antibodies, infliximab and adalimumab, for immune-mediated EIM of
      IBD.

TI  - Whole-grain consumption is associated with a reduced risk of noncardiovascular,
      noncancer death attributed to inflammatory diseases in the Iowa Women's Health
      Study.
PG  - 1606-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has recently been shown that oxidative stress, infection, and
      inflammation are predominant pathophysiologic factors for several major diseases.
      OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association of whole-grain intake with death
      attributed to noncardiovascular, noncancer inflammatory diseases. DESIGN:
      Postmenopausal women (n = 41 836) aged 55-69 y at baseline in 1986 were followed 
      for 17 y. After exclusions for cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, colitis,
      and liver cirrhosis at baseline, 27 312 participants remained, of whom 5552 died 
      during the 17 y. A proportional hazards regression model was adjusted for age,
      smoking, adiposity, education, physical activity, and other dietary factors.
      RESULTS: Inflammation-related death was inversely associated with whole-grain
      intake. Compared with the hazard ratios in women who rarely or never ate
      whole-grain foods, the hazard ratio was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.83) for those who
      consumed 4-7 servings/wk, 0.79 (0.66, 0.95) for 7.5-10.5 servings/wk, 0.64 (0.53,
      0.79) for 11-18.5 servings/wk, and 0.66 (0.54, 0.81) for >or=19 servings/wk (P
      for trend = 0.01). Previously reported inverse associations of whole-grain intake
      with total and coronary heart disease mortality persisted after 17 y of
      follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The reduction in inflammatory mortality associated with
      habitual whole-grain intake was larger than that previously reported for coronary
      heart disease and diabetes. Because a variety of phytochemicals are found in
      whole grains that may directly or indirectly inhibit oxidative stress, and
      because oxidative stress is an inevitable consequence of inflammation, we suggest
      that oxidative stress reduction by constituents of whole grain is a likely
      mechanism for the protective effect.

TI  - Challenges and progress in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 406-12
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The induction and maintenance of disease remission and
      prevention of complications are primary goals in the management of inflammatory
      bowel disease. Recent research has added new insights into the pathogenesis,
      epidemiology, and treatment options for children with inflammatory bowel disease,
      and the findings will enable clinicians to develop a more rational approach to
      the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis and
      Crohn's disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Population-based studies have confirmed the
      increased incidence of inflammatory bowel disease in children. Previous medical
      history and serologies can be predictive of complications in Crohn's disease.
      Newer radiological and capsule endoscopic modalities have a potential future role
      in the diagnosis and interval assessment of patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease. Biological therapies play an increasingly prominent role in the
      management of children with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Studies of
      children with inflammatory bowel disease suggest that behavioral interventions
      may have a positive impact on morbidity and overall quality of life. SUMMARY: New
      information concerning the natural history of Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis and a better understanding of different treatment modalities will enable 
      the development of increasingly effective and individualized pharmacological
      treatment plans for children with inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 400-5
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Nutrition plays a significant role in the pathogenesis and
      treatment of the two major forms of inflammatory bowel disease: Crohn's disease
      and ulcerative colitis. In addition, patients with inflammatory bowel disease are
      often found to have nutrient deficiencies at the time of diagnosis, whereas
      others develop features of malnutrition over the course of their illness.
      Therefore, an understanding of the relationship between nutrients and
      inflammatory bowel disease is important if these patients are to receive optimal 
      care. RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiologic and basic research has helped to shed light 
      on the interaction between diet and the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel
      disease. Numerous clinical trials utilizing various types of lipids, including
      fish oil and short chain fatty acids, suggest that fats play an important role in
      the inflammatory response that characterizes inflammatory bowel disease. Vitamins
      and other micronutrients involved in nutrient metabolism and modulation of
      oxidative stress are also considered in this review. SUMMARY: This update
      discusses nutritional issues that can be used to help prevent and treat nutrient 
      deficiencies and ameliorate disease activity in individuals with inflammatory
      bowel disease.

TI  - Dietary supplementation with beta-glucan enriched oat bran increases faecal
      concentration of carboxylic acids in healthy subjects.
PG  - 978-84
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Carboxylic acids (CAs), especially butyric acid, have been 
      suggested to counteract colonic diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and colon
      cancer. Colonic formation of CAs can be influenced by the diet, but the
      concentrations and pattern formed need to be evaluated for different food
      products in humans. To elucidate how the colonic concentration of CAs in healthy 
      subjects is influenced by dietary supplementation with oat bran, and whether the 
      concentration varies over time and during consecutive days. SUBJECTS/METHODS:
      Twenty-five healthy subjects (age 24+/-1.3) were recruited to the study. The
      subjects were given 40 g beta-glucan enriched oat bran per day, corresponding to 
      20 g dietary fibre, in 4 slices of bread. CAs were analysed in faeces during
      three consecutive days after 0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks on this diet. RESULTS: The
      concentration of acetic, propionic, butyric, isobutyric and isovaleric acid was
      higher (P<0.05-0.001) after 8 weeks on the oat bran diet as compared with values 
      at entry, whereas that of lactic acid was lower (P<0.05). After 12 weeks, the
      concentrations of acetic, propionic and isobutyric acid were still higher and
      that of lactic acid lower. The variation between individuals was considerable,
      whereas in the same individuals there was little variation. CONCLUSIONS: Oat bran
      increased the faecal concentration of CAs after 8 weeks, indicating an increased 
      concentration also in the distal colon. The concentration of all main acids
      increased, except for lactic acid, which decreased. Oat bran may therefore have a
      preventive potential adjunct to colonic diseases.

TI  - [Clinical characteristics of ulcerative colitis in four patients with severe
      motor and intellectual disabilities].
PG  - 214-8
AB  - We retrospectively reviewed four patients with severe motor and intellectual
      disabilities (SMID), aged 8-56 years, who presented with ulcerative colitis (UC),
      and discussed causal interrelationships between UC and SMID. UC started at 3-50
      years of age with early childhood-onset in two patients. Two patients had an
      intractable clinical course in which leukocytapheresis and surgery were
      ineffective, and resulted in steroid-dependency. We failed to find any causal
      relationships between infectious events, nutrition and anticonvulsants with the
      development of UC. However, when occult blood in feces is frequently positive in 
      SMID patients, it is important to consider the possibility of UC and to perform
      an intestinal endoscopic examination.

TI  - [Irritable bowel syndrome: current treatment options].
PG  - 1619-26
AB  - Relieving abdominal pain is the principal treatment objective for patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome. No single drug stands out in the treatment strategy for
      this illness. Antispasmodics, magnesium aluminum silicates, and alverine citrate 
      drugs all remain initial options for treatment, although their prescription is
      impeded by the fact that an increasing number are no longer approved for
      reimbursement. Increased dietary fibers often have a harmful effect on symptoms. 
      Some patients are probably intolerant to some foods but there is no satisfactory 
      proof on which to base a restrictive diet. Improved knowledge of the
      pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome has made it possible to diversify
      treatments that act first on one of the key pathophysiologic elements, visceral
      hypersensitivity. Antidepressants (especially tricyclics) can be used at low
      doses. Among the serotonergic drugs, serotonin 5-HT4 receptors agonists
      (tegaserod) may be available soon, but the development of 5-HT3 antagonists
      (alosetron, cilansetron) has been stopped for safety reasons (ischemic colitis
      and severe constipation). Non-drug options such as hypnosis, psychotherapy,
      relaxation, or yoga, may also be proposed to some patients. Probiotics are a
      possible treatment in the future.

TI  - Roles of CD1d-restricted NKT cells in the intestine.
PG  - 1146-52
AB  - Natural killer T (NKT) cells are a subset of lymphocytes that express cell
      surface molecules of both conventional T cells and natural killer cells and share
      the features of both innate and adaptive immune cells. NKT cells have been
      proposed to make both protective and pathogenic contributions to inflammatory
      bowel diseases (IBD). On the one hand, recent studies have shown that these cells
      are involved in the maintenance of mucosal homeostasis. On the other, NKT cells
      were shown to play a pathogenic role in human ulcerative colitis. Similar
      contrasting data have been generated in murine models of IBD. Whether the
      apparent differences in NKT response patterns depend on variations in NKT
      antigens and/or on the presence of specific subsets of mucosal NKT cells remains 
      to be elucidated. In this article we review the current literature on intestinal 
      NKT cells and their roles in IBD pathogenesis. Specifically, the nomenclature,
      NKT antigens, and immune mechanisms of NKT cells within the intestinal mucosa are
      discussed.

TI  - Differentiating ulcerative colitis from Crohn disease in children and young
      adults: report of a working group of the North American Society for Pediatric
      Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition and the Crohn's and Colitis
      Foundation of America.
PG  - 653-74
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have varied in 
      the criteria used to classify patients as having Crohn disease (CD), ulcerative
      colitis (UC), or indeterminate colitis (IC). Patients undergoing an initial
      evaluation for IBD will often undergo a series of diagnostic tests, including
      barium upper gastrointestinal series with small bowel follow-through, abdominal
      CT, upper endoscopy, and colonoscopy with biopsies. Other tests performed less
      frequently include magnetic resonance imaging scans, serological testing, and
      capsule endoscopy. The large amount of clinical information obtained may make a
      physician uncertain as to whether to label a patient as having CD or UC.
      Nevertheless, to facilitate the conduct of epidemiological studies in children,
      to allow the entry of children into clinical trials, and to allow physicians to
      more clearly discuss diagnosis with their patients, it is important that
      clinicians be able to differentiate between CD and UC. METHODS: A consensus
      conference regarding the diagnosis and classification of pediatric IBD was
      organized by the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America. The meeting included 
      10 pediatric gastroenterologists and 4 pediatric pathologists. The primary aim
      was to determine the utility of endoscopy and histology in establishing the
      diagnosis of CD and UC. Each member of the group was assigned a topic for review.
      Topics evaluated included differentiating inflammatory bowel disease from acute
      self-limited colitis, endoscopic and histological features that allow
      differentiation between CD and UC, upper endoscopic features seen in both CD and 
      UC, ileal inflammation and "backwash ileitis" in UC, patchiness and rectal
      sparing in pediatric IBD, periappendiceal inflammation in CD and UC, and
      definitions of IC. RESULTS: Patients with UC may have histological features such 
      as microscopic inflammation of the ileum, histological gastritis, periappendiceal
      inflammation, patchiness, and relative rectal sparing at the time of diagnosis.
      These findings should not prompt the clinician to change the diagnosis from UC to
      CD. Other endoscopic findings, such as macroscopic cobblestoning, segmental
      colitis, ileal stenosis and ulceration, perianal disease, and multiple granulomas
      in the small bowel or colon more strongly suggest a diagnosis of CD. An algorithm
      is provided to enable the clinician to differentiate more reliably between these 
      2 entities. CONCLUSIONS: The recommendations and algorithm presented here aim to 
      assist the clinician in differentiating childhood UC from CD. We hope the
      recommendations in this report will reduce variability among practitioners in how
      they use the terms "ulcerative colitis," "Crohn disease," and "indeterminate
      colitis." The authors hope that progress being made in genetic, serological, and 
      imaging studies leads to more reliable phenotyping.

TI  - Association of DLG5 variants with inflammatory bowel disease in the New Zealand
      Caucasian population and meta-analysis of the DLG5 R30Q variant.
PG  - 1069-76
AB  - BACKGROUND: Variants in the DLG5 gene have been associated with inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) in samples from some, but not all populations. In particular,
      2 nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), R30Q (rs1248696) and
      P1371Q (rs2289310), have been associated with an increased risk of IBD, and a
      common haplotype (called haplotype "A") has been associated with reduced risk.
      METHODS: We genotyped R30Q, P1371Q, and a haplotype A tagging SNP (rs2289311) in 
      a New Zealand Caucasian cohort of 389 Crohn's disease (CD) patients, 406
      ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, and 416 population controls. Each SNP was
      tested for association with disease susceptibility and clinical phenotypes. We
      also performed a meta-analysis of R30Q data from published association studies.
      RESULTS: The haplotype A tagging SNP was associated with reduced risk of IBD at
      the 0.05 significance level (P=0.036) with an allelic odds ratio of 0.83 (95%
      confidence interval [CI]: 0.69-0.99). Association with haplotype A was strongest 
      (odds ratio approximately 0.57) in UC patients with familial IBD or
      extraintestinal manifestations. The R30Q and P1371Q polymorphisms were not
      significantly associated with UC, CD, or IBD. Analysis of male and female data
      did not find any gender-specific associations. Meta-analysis gave no evidence of 
      association of R30Q with IBD. CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analysis demonstrates that the
      minor allele of R30Q is not a risk factor for IBD across populations. This study 
      provides some evidence that DLG5 haplotype A is associated with reduced risk of
      IBD in the New Zealand Caucasian population, but this association will need to be
      replicated in an independent sample.

TI  - Wireless capsule endoscopy in the pediatric age group: experience and
      complications.
PG  - 516-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: The development of wireless capsule endoscopy (CE) provides a unique 
      opportunity to visualize the entire small bowel in a minimally invasive manner.
      Studies in adult patients have demonstrated that the disposable capsule is well
      tolerated and highly effective, but few studies have been done in children. The
      aims of our study were to compare the diagnostic yield of CE and small bowel
      series in children being evaluated for possible small intestine disease and to
      determine the risk of developing an adverse event following capsule endoscopy.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of all children who
      underwent CE at 1 institution between August 2002 and July 2005. Results of CE
      were compared with those of small bowel radiographic studies when available.
      RESULTS: There were 46 CE studies from 45 patients, 28 male and 17 female, with a
      mean age of 14.9 +/- 3.6 years and mean weight of 49.7 +/- 17.5 kg. The
      indications for CE included unresponsive Crohn disease (n = 16), possible
      intestinal polyps (n = 11), unexplained iron deficiency anemia (n = 7), growth
      failure (n = 5), unresponsive ulcerative colitis (n = 3), persistent abdominal
      pain (n = 1), protein-losing enteropathy (n = 1), and allergic enteropathy with
      occult gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 1). Of the 46 CE studies, 41 were completed
      and 5 were incomplete studies. Based on the CE, 9 patients were newly diagnosed
      with Crohn disease, 9 patients with Crohn disease were newly diagnosed with small
      bowel involvement, 8 patients had upper intestinal polyps, 1 patient had findings
      consistent with Menetrier disease, and 1 had a duodenal ulcer. Thirty-three
      patients had small bowel series before CE: 24 studies were normal, 6 had abnormal
      thickening of the small bowel, 2 had polyps, and 1 patient had antral narrowing. 
      All 9 patients with abnormal small bowel series had abnormal CE studies. Of the
      24 patients with normal small bowel series, 20 had completed CE studies, and in
      10 children, the study was abnormal. Nine of the 45 subjects had adverse events. 
      Five patients had delayed passage from the stomach, with 2 needing endoscopic
      retrieval of the CE, and 4 had delayed passage from the small intestine (>5
      days), with 2 requiring surgical removal, 1 responding to steroids, and the final
      patient requiring an ileocolic resection 2 months after the CE for an undiagnosed
      ileal stricture. The only significant association noted was that older patients
      were more likely to have intestinal retention. CONCLUSIONS: CE provides a
      valuable tool in the evaluation of pediatric patients for possible small bowel
      disease. However, the risk of developing complications appears to be greater in
      the pediatric population, with 20% of our patients having an adverse event.

TI  - Colonic infiltration with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.
PG  - 229-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: A 75-year-old female presented with a 1 month history of non-bloody
      diarrhea, associated with abdominal cramping and urgency. Her medical history was
      notable for chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, diagnosed 6 years previously and
      managed expectantly by monitoring the patient's complete blood count. Over
      several months, the patient's symptoms progressed, which resulted in significant 
      weight loss. The patient's course of disease was ultimately complicated by acute 
      disseminated encephalomyelitis and death. INVESTIGATIONS: Physical examination,
      laboratory investigations, stool studies, colonoscopy with biopsies,
      immunohistochemistry and pathologic review of biopsy specimens. DIAGNOSIS:
      Leukemic colitis. MANAGEMENT: Management of underlying leukemia with systemic
      hydroxyurea and topical colonic 5-aminosalicylic acid therapy.

TI  - Colectomy rate in steroid-refractory colitis initially responsive to cyclosporin:
      a long-term retrospective cohort study.
PG  - 13
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is consistent evidence that 50% of patients with acute,
      steroid-resistant flare of ulcerative colitis (UC) may achieve remission and
      avoid colectomy if treated with cyclosporin (CsA). However, follow-up of the
      responders has shown that most of them relapse and need surgery shortly after the
      response. We compared the records of our CsA-treated patients with those of other
      groups in order to help clarify this matter. METHODS: All patients admitted
      consecutively to our Unit with an attack of UC and treated with CsA between
      January 1991 and December 1999 were studied. Patients were begun on
      continuously-infused CsA at 2 mg/kg/day (1991-1996), or on NEORAL at an initial
      dose of 5 mg/kg/day (1996-1999). The maintenance treatment included oral CsA for 
      3-6 months with or without azathioprine (AZA). CsA failure was defined as a
      relapse requiring steroids with or without progression to colectomy; the
      cumulative probability of relapse/colectomy was assessed by Fisher's exact tests 
      and Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: Among the patients, 39/61 (63%) initially
      responded. These 39 included a fatality and 4 drop-outs (unrelated to the
      side-effects of CsA), leaving 34 patients for the study. Of these, 61% and 35%
      were colectomy-free at 1 and 7 years, respectively; the corresponding figures
      were 80 and 60% respectively in the subset treated with AZA, but 47% and 15% in
      the AZA-untreated subgroup (p= 0.0007 at 7 years). Among the 34 patients, 44%
      were relapse-free at 1 year, but all had relapsed at 7 years (p = 0.0635). The
      overall resort to colectomy was 72%, while 19% of the patients remained
      colectomy-free. CONCLUSION: Sixty percent of a cohort of patients with
      steroid-refractory colitis responded to CsA and 60% of these responders retained 
      the colon after 1 year. These figures fell to 35% at 7 years but improved to 60% 
      on AZA. The overall need for colectomy remains high in these patients and
      toxicity must be monitored.

TI  - Nutrition issues in pediatric Crohn's disease.
PG  - 214-22
AB  - Twenty-five percent of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) diagnoses present in
      childhood, with Crohn's disease (CD) being the most common type. Many children
      have poor nutrition status at presentation of the disease, which may worsen
      during the clinical course, with a significant number of children having impaired
      linear growth. The cause of this poor nutrition status is complex, and
      contributing factors include inadequate intake, malabsorption, altered energy
      demands, and losses through stool, particularly in colitis. The principal aim of 
      medical management is to induce disease remission, with minimal side effects,
      thereby enabling normal growth and development. This must include active
      consideration of the nutrition needs of such children and how they may be best
      met. However, our understanding of the manner in which the disease process
      affects the energy demands of children with CD or how poor nutrition, in turn,
      may affect the disease course is limited. This may constrain the efficacy and
      effectiveness of standard therapeutic approaches to care. This review explores
      the many factors of relevance in the delivery of nutrition support to children
      with inflammatory bowel disease, and explores the role of exclusive enteral
      nutrition as a corticosteroid-sparing strategy to induce remission in children
      with active Crohn's disease.

TI  - Dysbiosis in pouchitis: evidence of unique microfloral patterns in pouch
      inflammation.
PG  - 352-60
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Pouch inflammation after surgery for ulcerative colitis can
      significantly alter quality of life and thus ideally should be prevented.
      Dysbiosis or altered microflora is suspected to be the key pathogenic factor for 
      pouchitis. However, dysbiosis in pouchitis has not been characterized carefully
      because of a lack of available sensitive microbiological technology suitable for 
      in vivo studies in human beings. Thus, the aims of our study were as follows: (1)
      to show the use of the length heterogeneity polymerase chain reaction (LH-PCR)
      technique for studying microflora in human beings, and (2) to use the technique
      to characterize the microfloral patterns in the ileal pouch of patients with
      pouchitis. METHODS: Microfloral patterns initially were assessed using a 16S
      ribosomal RNA technique (LH-PCR) to determine the qualitative changes in the
      luminal and mucosal intestinal flora. We subsequently cloned and sequenced the
      LH-PCR amplification products from the community 16S ribosomal RNA found in
      patients with pouchitis and in control pouch to identify the microbial species
      involved in pouchitis. RESULTS: We have shown unique microfloral patterns in
      pouchitis. Through cloning and sequencing of the LH-PCR amplicons, we have shown 
      the persistence of Fusobacter and Enteric species associated with the disease
      state and the absence of specific bacteria such as Streptococcus species in the
      inflamed pouch. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that the LH-PCR technique is suitable 
      for studying microflora in human beings. By using this technique and the clone
      sequences, we have shown dysbiosis in the microbial biofilm adherent to the
      mucosa in pouchitis. Our data provide direct evidence of the role of bacteria in 
      the pathogenesis of pouchitis.

TI  - Isolation and characterisation of new putative probiotic bacteria from human
      colonic flora.
PG  - 725-34
AB  - The present study describes a novel bacterial isolate exhibiting high ability to 
      synthesise and secrete butyrate. The novel isolated bacterium was obtained from
      human faeces and grown in selective liquid intestinal microflora medium
      containing rumen fluid under microaerobic conditions. Its probiotic properties
      were demonstrated by the ability of the isolate to survive high acidity and
      medium containing bile acids and the ability to adhere to colon cancer cells
      (Caco-2) in vitro. Phylogenetic identity to Enterococcus durans was established
      using specific primers for 16S rRNA (99% probability). PCR analyses with primers 
      to the bacterial gene encoding butyrate kinase, present in the butyrogenic
      bacteria Clostridium, showed that this gene is present in E. durans. The in vivo 
      immunoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of E. durans were assessed in
      dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in Balb/c mice. Administration of E.
      durans ameliorated histological, clinical and biochemical scores directly related
      to intestinal inflammation whereas the lactic acid bacterium Lactobacillus
      delbrueckii was ineffective in this regard. Colonic cDNA concentrations of
      IL-1beta and TNF-alpha were significantly down regulated in DSS-treated E.
      durans-fed mice but not in control or DSS-treated L. delbrueckii- fed mice.
      Fluorescent in situ hybridisation analyses of colonic tissue from mice fed E.
      durans, using a butyrate kinase probe, demonstrated that E. durans significantly 
      adheres to the colonic tissue. The novel isolated bacterium described in the
      present paper, upon further characterisation, can be developed into a useful
      probiotic aimed at the treatment of patients suffering from ulcerative colitis.

TI  - A pilot study of fecal serine-protease activity: a pathophysiologic factor in
      diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 550-5
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) remains
      only partially understood, and no specific or universally effective patient
      management procedure has been developed to date. Our study was designed to
      evaluate if colonic luminal serine-proteases may be a relevant pathophysiologic
      marker of IBS. METHODS: Fecal samples of 38 IBS patients, 15 patients with
      ulcerative colitis (UC), and 15 healthy controls were studied. Fecal
      serine-protease activity was determined photometrically by using azocasein as a
      proteolytic substrate; fecal pancreatic elastase-1 and mast cell tryptase content
      were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Fecal secretory leukocyte
      protease inhibitor concentration was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
      assay in control subjects and in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS. RESULTS:
      Fecal serine-protease activity was 3-fold higher in patients with
      diarrhea-predominant IBS than in both controls and IBS patients with either
      constipation or alternating bowel habits. Fecal serine-protease activity was not 
      correlated with the frequency of bowel movements in all groups. Increased
      serine-protease activity also was detected in stools of UC patients. No
      significant difference was observed in the fecal mast cell tryptase and
      pancreatic elastase concentrations between all groups, or in the fecal secretory 
      leukocyte protease inhibitor concentration between controls and
      diarrhea-predominant IBS patients. CONCLUSIONS: Fecal serine-protease activity is
      increased markedly in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS. This increase,
      however, is not coupled with changes in either mast cell tryptase or pancreatic
      elastase concentrations. Thus, serine-protease activity in the colon may be a
      pathophysiologic factor in the development of diarrhea-predominant IBS.

TI  - Differential protein expression profile in the intestinal epithelium from
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1114-25
AB  - The loss of intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) function is a critical component in 
      the initiation and perpetuation of chronic intestinal inflammation in the
      genetically susceptible host. We applied proteome analysis (PA) to characterize
      changes in the protein expression profile of primary IEC from patients with
      Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Surgical specimens from 18
      patients with active CD (N = 6), UC (N = 6), and colonic cancer (N = 6) were used
      to purify primary IEC from ileal and colonic tissues. Changes in protein
      expression were identified using 2D-gel electrophoreses (2D SDS-PAGE) and peptide
      mass fingerprinting via MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) as well as Western blot 
      analysis. PA of primary IEC from inflamed ileal tissue of CD patients and colonic
      tissue of UC patients identified 21 protein spots with at least 2-fold changes in
      steady-state expression levels compared to the noninflamed tissue of control
      patients. Statistical significance was achieved for 9 proteins including the
      Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor alpha that was up-regulated in CD and UC patients.
      Additionally, 40 proteins with significantly altered expression levels were
      identified in IEC from inflamed compared to noninflamed tissue regions of single 
      UC (N = 2) patients. The most significant change was detected for programmed cell
      death protein 8 (7.4-fold increase) and annexin 2A (7.7-fold increase). PA in
      primary IEC from IBD patients revealed significant expression changes of proteins
      that are associated with signal transduction, stress response as well as energy
      metabolism. The induction of Rho GDI alpha expression may be associated with the 
      destruction of IEC homeostasis under condition of chronic intestinal
      inflammation.

TI  - Short- and long-term response to and weaning from infliximab therapy in pediatric
      ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 312-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the response to infliximab in pediatric patients with
      ulcerative colitis (UC) and their long-term follow-up. We expanded our previous
      study of 14 patients and furthermore evaluated the success of weaning patients
      from infliximab. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the charts of 27 pediatric
      patients with UC who were treated with infliximab instead of undergoing a
      colectomy. Patients with new-onset UC refractory to intravenous steroids for 5 to
      10 days and patients with non-steroid-dependent UC with an acute exacerbation
      were classified as acutely ill (n = 16); patients with chronic steroid-dependent 
      UC were classified as chronically ill (n = 11). The Lichtiger Colitis Activity
      Index (LCAI) was measured for all patients at baseline and at 1 and 2 months
      after treatment with infliximab was initiated. Patients were regarded as
      successfully treated if they remained off steroids and avoided colectomy.
      RESULTS: The acutely ill group had a mean LCAI score of 11.4 at induction and 0.3
      after 2 months. The chronically ill group had a mean LCAI score of 11.2 at
      induction and 5.5 after 2 months. Treatment with infliximab was successful in 75%
      of acutely ill patients and in 27% of chronically ill patients. Infliximab was
      discontinued in 80% of successfully treated patients (83% of acutely ill, 67% of 
      chronically ill). These patients had an average of 10 infusions and a mean
      follow-up time of 10 months from their last infliximab infusion. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      results suggest that infliximab is more effective in acutely ill UC patients than
      in patients with chronic steroid-dependent UC. In addition, some patients treated
      with infliximab can be weaned from infliximab and maintain remission.

TI  - Effect of allopurinol on clinical outcomes in inflammatory bowel disease
      nonresponders to azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine.
PG  - 209-14
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Many IBD patients not responding to azathioprine (AZA) or
      6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) preferentially metabolize 6-MP to 6-methylmercaptopurine 
      (6-MMP). We describe the use of allopurinol in AZA/6-MP nonresponders to
      deliberately shunt metabolism of 6-MP toward 6-thioguanine (6-TGN) and improve
      clinical responses. METHODS: Twenty outpatients who were AZA/6-MP nonresponders
      and had high 6-MMP metabolite levels were included. Subjects were commenced on
      allopurinol 100 mg daily, and the dose of 6-MP/AZA was reduced to 25%-50% of the 
      original dose. RESULTS: After allopurinol was started, mean 6-TGN levels
      increased from 191.3 (+/- standard error of the mean) +/- 17.1 to 400.3 +/- 36.9 
      pmol/8 x 10(8) red blood cells (P < .001), whereas mean 6-MMP levels decreased
      from 10,604.7 +/- 1278.2 to 2000.6 +/- 437.1 pmol/8 x 10(8) red blood cells (P < 
      .001). The addition of allopurinol led to a reduction in the mean partial Harvey 
      Bradshaw Index in Crohn's disease patients from 4.9 +/- 1.0 to 1.5 +/- 0.3 points
      (P = .001), and in ulcerative colitis patients mean Mayo Scores decreased from
      4.1 +/- 0.7 to 2.9 +/- 0.7 points (P = .13). The addition of allopurinol enabled 
      a reduction in mean daily prednisone dosage from 17.6 +/- 3.9 to 1.8 +/- 0.7 mg
      (P < .001) and led to normalization of transaminase levels, with mean AST levels 
      reducing from 42.5 +/- 8.1 to 23.5 +/- 1.6 IU (P = .12) and mean ALT levels
      reducing from 101.6 +/- 26.9 to 33.9 +/- 5.2 IU (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: The
      addition of allopurinol to thiopurine nonresponders with high 6-MMP metabolite
      levels is an effective and safe means of optimizing 6-TGN production, leading to 
      improved disease activity scores, reduced corticosteroid requirements, and
      normalization of liver enzymes.

TI  - High proportions of proinflammatory bacteria on the colonic mucosa in a young
      patient with ulcerative colitis as revealed by cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA
      genes.
PG  - 620-7
AB  - The pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC) remains unknown. It is thought to be 
      due to an abnormal and uncontrolled immune response to normally occurring
      constituents of the intestine. Microbial agents appear to be involved in the
      pathogenesis and intestinal bacteria seem to be an important factor in the
      development and chronicity. The aim of this study was to investigate the colonic 
      microbiota of a patient with UC. The colonic tissues were taken during surgery
      from a 12-year-old girl suffering from UC. The microbiota on the colonic samples 
      was studied by cloning and sequencing of amplified 16S rRNA genes. Compared with 
      healthy subjects, alteration of the dominant bacterial group was observed in the 
      UC patient. We found a high incidence of Enterobacteriaceae, Bacteroides
      fragilis, and the single phylotype of the Faecalibacterium prausnitzii-like
      "Butyrate-producing bacterium" L2-6. Furthermore, there was a substantial
      presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the present case of UC. The high proportion
      of adverse proinflammatory species is striking in the present case compared with 
      more normal situations. Even if those bacteria are not the cause of the UC, they 
      most probably enhance the symptoms of the disease.

TI  - Polymorphisms of tumor necrosis factor-alpha but not MDR1 influence response to
      medical therapy in pediatric-onset inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 171-9
AB  - AIM: We investigated the contribution of variants of tumour necrosis factor
      (TNF)-alpha and MDR1 genes in the predisposition and response to medical therapy 
      in a large pediatric cohort of patients with Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative
      colitis (UC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, 200 patients with CD, 186
      patients with UC, 434 parents (217 trios), and 347 healthy unrelated controls
      were investigated. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms -G308A and -C857T of the
      TNF-alpha gene and C3435T of the MDR1 gene were investigated and correlated with 
      clinical subphenotypes and efficacy of medical therapy. RESULTS: The frequency of
      the -308A allele of the TNF-alpha gene was significantly increased in both
      patients with CD (15%; odds ratio [OR] = 2.79; P < 0.01) and patients with UC
      (11%; OR = 1.96; P < 0.003) compared with controls (6%). Carriers of this allele 
      were 27% in CD (OR = 2.94; P < 0.01) and 19% in UC (OR = 1.86; P = 0.015)
      compared with 11% in healthy controls. No significant difference was found for
      both the -C857T and C3435T single-nucleotide polymorphisms. With the
      genotype/phenotype analysis, no correlation in patients with UC with the MDR1
      gene was found. CD carriers of the -308A allele had a higher frequency of
      surgical resection (35% vs 20%; OR = 2.1; P = 0.035) and more frequent resistance
      to steroids (22% vs 8%; OR = 0.29; P = 0.032) compared with noncarriers. These
      findings were confirmed by stepwise logistic regression. CONCLUSIONS: In our
      pediatric cohort, the promoter -308A polymorphism of TNF-alpha but not the MDR1
      gene is significantly involved in the predisposition to both CD and UC. This
      polymorphism carries a significant reduction in response to steroid therapy,
      probably leading to a more frequent need for surgical resection.

AB  - Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a rare neoplasm in the colorectum. A case of SCC
      rising from an area of squamous metaplasia in the rectum is presented in a
      patient with long-standing ulcerative colitis and perianal warts. This is the
      first report in the literature describing the evolution of squamous metaplasia in
      the colonic mucosa into invasive carcinoma over time. Related literature on
      colorectal SCC and squamous metaplasia, and their relationships with inflammatory
      bowel disease and human papilloma virus, is reviewed.

TI  - Lamina propria and circulating interleukin-8 in newly and previously diagnosed
      pediatric inflammatory bowel disease patients.
PG  - 365-72
AB  - Dysregulation of interleukin-8 (IL-8) production has been proposed to contribute 
      to intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Previous
      studies, which evaluate adult patients with long-standing or steroid-modulated
      disease, have reported conflicting results regarding the role of IL-8 in IBD
      pathogenesis. The present study evaluates IL-8 in colonic organ cultures and sera
      of newly and previously diagnosed pediatric IBD patients with various degrees of 
      histopathologic activity. Colon and terminal ileum biopsies were obtained from 26
      patients with Crohn's disease, 12 with ulcerative colitis, 4 with indeterminate
      colitis, and 12 age-matched normal controls. IBD patients were additionally
      characterized as newly or previously diagnosed. Supernatants from organ-cultured 
      lamina propria biopsies and sera were evaluated by ELISA for IL-8 protein. IL-8
      increased with degree of histologic inflammation regardless of diagnosis (no
      pathologic diagnosis, 62.6 ng/ml, interquartile range [IQR] 30.4-94.6 ng/ml;
      mild, 92.0 ng/ml, IQR 21.9-170.0 ng/ml; moderate, 676.2 ng/ml, IQR 46.4-2967.7
      ng/ml; severe, 585.6 ng/ml, IQR 149.7-1602.2 ng/ml; P < 0.01). Lamina propria
      IL-8 was significantly elevated in moderately and severely inflamed tissue
      segments (603.26 ng/ml; IQR, 72.15-2240.4 ng/ml) compared to noninflamed and
      mildly inflamed segments (67.70 ng/ml; IQR, 30.38-124.1 ng/ml; P = 0.0009). There
      was no significant trend in IL-8 concentration when compared by clinical
      diagnosis. No significant difference was found in IL-8 concentrations in organ
      cultures from newly diagnosed patients versus those from previously diagnosed
      patients. There was no significant correlation between serum IL-8 concentration
      and organ culture IL-8 concentration. We conclude that higher concentrations of
      IL-8 are found in more histologically inflamed tissue segments from pediatric IBD
      patients. IL-8 does not appear to be associated with clinical IBD subtype. IL-8
      appears to be an integral part of both early and established mucosal inflammation
      in pediatric IBD patients. These findings suggest that IL-8-specific therapies
      may universally modify inflammatory activity in IBD patients.

TI  - A web-based patient education system and self-help group in Persian language for 
      inflammatory bowel disease patients.
PG  - 122-8
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To study the use patterns of a Persian web-based patient
      education system for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients in Iran. METHODS: 
      A web-based patient education system was developed with Persian content in three 
      sections: general, ulcerative colitis (UC), and Crohn's disease (CD). The website
      included a forum for patients to communicate as a self-help group. A customized
      web tracking system recorded web use statistics. Polls at the bottom of each page
      collected the visitors' opinion on the extent of helpfulness and readability of
      page contents. Web use data were analyzed for an 18-month period from October
      2004 to April 2006. RESULTS: Having excluded page visits from search engine
      robots, the website's homepage was visited 4452 times (mean of monthly visits:
      234, range: 102-330). The web pages titled Anatomy of gastrointestinal system,
      Nutrition in IBD, Diagnostic tests, How to cope with IBD, and IBD in women were
      the most favorite in general section. The web page titled IBD treatment was the
      most visited in both CD and UC sections followed by the web pages on cause of
      disease, diagnostic procedures and complications in CD section; and those titled 
      symptoms, cause of disease and risk factors in the UC section. Overall, the
      content evaluation polls received 294 hits (from 186 unique visitors) of which,
      196 (67%) were from patients, 30 (10%) from patients' relatives/friends, 21 (7%) 
      from doctors, and 47 (16%) from other groups. During the 18-month period, 47
      patients registered in the self-help forum, 24 threads were opened, and 97 posts 
      (33 in CD and 64 in UC section) were sent. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the
      increasing trend of Internet use in developing countries like Iran, and the
      consequent increase in the proportion of Internet-using patients, and finally the
      time constraints gastroenterologists face answering patients' questions; similar 
      websites seem to be effective ways of patient education in close future.

TI  - Natural history of bone metabolism and bone mineral density in children with
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 42-50
AB  - BACKGROUND: In children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) it is not known
      whether reductions in bone mineral density (BMD) are a consequence of bone
      turnover alterations and if BMD improves with treatment. METHODS: In a cohort of 
      children with IBD, we prospectively measured indicators of bone remodeling, body 
      mass index (BMI), disease activity, intact parathyroid hormone, serum IL-6, and
      insulin-like growth factor-I at diagnosis and then every 6 months for 2 years.
      BMD was determined annually using dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). BMD Z-scores
      were calculated using height/age. Baseline measurements and calcium intake were
      compared with a group of age- and sex-matched healthy children. RESULTS: We
      observed that at diagnosis total body BMD Z-score (mean +/- SD) was -0.78 +/-
      1.02 for Crohn's disease (CD, n = 58), -0.46 +/- 1.14 for ulcerative colitis (UC,
      n = 18), and -0.17 +/- 0.95 for control (CL, n = 49) (P < 0.01, CD versus CL). In
      CD, a BMD Z-score <-1.0 was associated with lower BMI and higher serum IL-6.
      Patients with CD and UC had low bone turnover. Activation of bone formation
      paralleled clinical improvement, but BMC gain was less than expected over the
      2-year study period, especially in CD. Prednisone use did not correlate with low 
      BMD. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased bone turnover occurs in children newly diagnosed with
      IBD. Although indicators of osteoblast activity increase with clinical
      improvement, bone mineral accrual does not accelerate. Children with low BMI may 
      be considered for BMD screening, since they are at risk for low bone mass.

TI  - Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody does not differentiate between Crohn's
      disease and intestinal tuberculosis.
PG  - 33-9
AB  - The clinical, morphological, and histological features of intestinal tuberculosis
      (IT) and Crohn's disease (CD) mimic so much, that it becomes difficult to
      differentiate between them. The sensitivity of anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae
      antibody (ASCA) IgG and ASCA IgA in CD is 60%-80%, whereas the specificity is
      almost 90%. There are no reports of study of ASCA in patients with IT, nor has it
      ever been used to differentiate CD from IT. Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC;
      n=25), CD (n=59), and IT (n=30) and 21 healthy controls were included in this
      study. The location and behavior of CD were classified according to the Modified 
      Montreal classification. Five milliliters of blood was taken from them and serum 
      was stored at -70 degrees C. ASCA antibodies (both IgG and IgA) were estimated
      using commercially available ELISA kits (AESKU Diagnostics, Germany).
      Anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody was measured by indirect
      immunofluorescence test. ASCA IgA was positive in 4.7%, 28%, 33.9%, and 43.3% and
      ASCA IgG was positive in 4.7%, 24%, 50.8%, and 46.6% of healthy controls and
      patients with UC, CD, and IT, respectively. Either ASCA IgG or ASCA IgA was
      positive in 9.5%, 40%, 61% and 66.6% of healthy controls, UC, CD, and IT,
      respectively. ANCA was positive in 0%, 32%, 10.1%, and 6.6% of healthy controls, 
      UC, CD, and IT, respectively. ASCA IgG was positive in a significantly higher
      number of patients with CD (P<0.0001) and IT (P<0.0001) in comparison to healthy 
      controls. ASCA IgA was positive in a significantly higher number of patients with
      UC (P<0.04), CD (P<0.013), and IT (P<0.006) in comparison to healthy controls. In
      comparisons between diseases, ASCA IgG was positive in significantly more
      patients with CD (P<0.001) and IT (P<0.001) in comparison to UC. There was no
      significant difference in ASCA IgA (33.9% vs. 43.3%), ASCA IgG (50.86% vs.
      46.6%), or ANCA (10.7%, 7.4%) in patients with CD and IT, respectively. There was
      no correlation between ASCA and duration, location and behavior of CD, and IT. We
      conclude that ASCA IgG and ASCA IgA do not help to differentiate between IT and
      CD.

TI  - Response to corticosteroids in severe ulcerative colitis: a systematic review of 
      the literature and a meta-regression.
PG  - 103-10
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Colectomy is a potentially life-saving procedure for patients 
      with severe attacks of UC who fail medical therapy. We aimed to systematically
      review studies that reported the short-term colectomy rate in severe UC or
      reported variables that could predict treatment failure. METHODS: We conducted a 
      systematic literature search for cohort studies and controlled trials published
      between 1974-2006. RESULTS: Thirty-two studies met the inclusion criteria; 16
      reported short-term outcome and predictors of therapy failure, 13 only outcome,
      and 3 only predictors. In the pooled analysis, 581 of 1991 patients required
      colectomy (weighted mean 27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 26%-28%), and 22 died 
      (1%; 95% CI, 0.7%-1.5%). In a heterogeneity-controlled meta-regression, colectomy
      rate did not change during the last 30 years (R(2) = 0.07, P = .8). Cyclosporine 
      was used in only 100 patients, with a 51% (95% CI, 41%-60%) short-term success
      rate. A second meta-regression failed to demonstrate a dose-colectomy response of
      methylprednisolone therapy beyond 60 mg daily (R(2) < 0.01, P = .98). More than
      20 variables were identified in 19 studies to predict medical therapy failure,
      but only a few were consistently reproduced: disease extent, stool frequency,
      temperature, heart rate, C-reactive protein, albumin, and radiologic assessment. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The short-term colectomy rate in severe UC has remained stable
      during the last 30 years, despite the introduction of cyclosporine, which was not
      used frequently. We could not find any support for administering
      methylprednisolone at a higher dose than 60 mg/day. Variables that predict
      outcome of corticosteroid therapy could aid in the development of guidelines for 
      introduction of rescue therapies in severe UC.

TI  - Colon cancer, fatty acids and anti-inflammatory compounds.
PG  - 48-54
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To outline recent findings on the efficacy of n-3
      polyunsaturated fatty acids in the prevention/treatment of inflammatory bowel
      disease and colorectal cancer. RECENT FINDINGS: Compelling data indicate a
      functional link between chronic inflammation and colon cancer. With respect to
      environmental risk factors, there is growing evidence that long-chain n-3
      polyunsaturated fatty acids found in fish oil suppress inflammatory bowel
      diseases and colon cancer risk in humans. Unfortunately, the molecular basis of
      the effect of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on inflammation/colitis-associated 
      colon cancer risk is still largely obscure. In this review, we focus on recent
      studies which address three emerging mechanisms of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty
      acids action: (1) metabolic interconversion into bioactive eicosanoids, (2)
      modulation of nuclear receptor activation, and (3) alteration of membrane
      phospholipid composition and functionality of lipid microdomains. SUMMARY: The
      consumption of dietary fish oil may prove to be an effective adjuvant therapy in 
      colon cancer. Therefore, it is both appropriate and timely to determine precisely
      how n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids modulate cell signaling networks, and reduce 
      the risk of developing colon cancer and inflammatory disorders of the intestine.

TI  - Changes in pulmonary function in patients with ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 977-82
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Information on the occurrence and frequency of pulmonary involvement 
      in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) is inconsistent. Some authors reported
      pulmonary impairment with UC by standard pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and
      documented a reduced diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) especially in 
      patients with active disease, whereas others could not detect differences in
      routine PFTs between UC patients and controls. AIM: The aim of this prospective
      study was to determine the frequency and type of pulmonary dysfunction in
      patients with UC with respect to disease activity. Furthermore, to evaluate the
      influence of smoking, nutritional status, sputum cytology and sulphasalazine
      therapy on PFT parameters. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-six patients with UC (20 
      with active disease, 6 inactive) and 16 age and sex matched healthy controls were
      investigated with respect to the following pulmonary function tests, forced vital
      capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in the 1s (FEV(1)%) and their ratio
      (FEV(1)/FVC) and forced expiratory flow 25-75% (FEF25-75%) as well as oxygen
      saturation. For UC patients, colonoscopy and biopsy were done. Disease activity
      was assessed by Truelove index for UC. Induced sputum was sampled for cytology.
      Smoking habit, body mass index (BMI) and medications were recorded. RESULTS:
      Fifteen out of 26 patients with UC (57.6%) exhibited at least one pathological
      pulmonary function test (<80% of predicted value). Small airway obstruction was
      reported in the 15 patients, restrictive dysfunction in 30.7% and obstructive
      dysfunction in 11.5%. The impairment of PFTs was significant and more pronounced 
      in patients with active disease, FVC (-14% of predicted), FEV(1) (-9% of
      predicted) and FEF25-75% (-32% of predicted), P<0.01, 0.05 and 0.01,
      respectively. There was no significant influence of smoking and medications on
      PFTs. CONCLUSIONS: UC patients show significantly decreased lung function tests
      in comparison to healthy controls. The impairment in active disease exceeded that
      during the remission. Early recognition is important, as they can be strikingly
      steroid responsive.
