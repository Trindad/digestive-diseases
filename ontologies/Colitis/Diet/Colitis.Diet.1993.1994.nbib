TI  - Nutrition support in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1443-56
AB  - The mechanisms of nutritional therapy in inflammatory bowel disease have not been
      thoroughly established. It is likely that a further understanding of the
      underlying disease process will allow better understanding of these forms of
      therapy, with a sounder rationale for the construction of specific diet
      constituents for therapy. Regardless, nutritional therapy is likely to be
      multidimensional, and various forms may affect different aspects of the disease
      process. Decreased inflammatory factors, decreased antigenic stimuli, provision
      of essential nutrients, improved immune function, and other factors may all be of
      varying importance in different patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Little 
      work has been done on the role of diet therapy in the long-term treatment of
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease as a method of preventing relapse.
      Parenteral nutrition and elemental diets appear to have limited roles in this
      area. Some investigation has been done to see if minor modifications of the
      normal diet can prolong remission periods. Low-fiber diets are frequently
      recommended for patients with strictures. Whether this has any significant effect
      on symptoms, inflammation, or complications is unclear. Heaton et al suggested
      that a high-fiber, unrefined carbohydrate diet resulted in fewer and shorter
      hospitalizations. In a prospective follow-up study by Ritchie et al, however,
      these results were not able to be reproduced. Exclusion diets have also been
      suggested as a means of reducing relapse rates in patients with Crohn's disease. 
      In a small, randomized, controlled trial of an exclusion diet versus an unrefined
      carbohydrate, fiber-rich diet, there were significantly fewer relapses among the 
      patients treated with the exclusion diet at 6 months. These diets require
      intensive patient cooperation, but the potential side effects are minimal.
      Clearly, these findings need to be reproduced in large, prospective, randomized, 
      controlled studies before widespread use can be advocated. A great deal of data
      exists on the use of nutritional supplementation in the treatment of inflammatory
      bowel disease, although little of it is in the form of large, randomized,
      controlled studies. Nutritional manipulation currently has a limited role in
      patients with ulcerative colitis; a much broader role exists in patients with
      Crohn's disease. The mechanisms by which nutritional therapy affects these
      diseases may include a combination of factors--decreased antigenic exposure,
      improved immune function, and provision of essential nutrients and calories
      needed for bowel regeneration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

TI  - Mechanisms of decreased food intake during weight loss in adult Crohn's disease
      patients without obvious malabsorption.
PG  - 775-81
AB  - Because weight loss is common in colonic Crohn's disease and is poorly correlated
      with disease activity, we analyzed food intake in 63 patients without
      malabsorption, 30 patients with weight loss (9.2 +/- 4.2 kg), and 33 patients
      without weight loss. Energy and protein intakes were lower in patients with
      weight loss than in those with stable weight (P < 0.01). In the former group,
      food restrictions were more numerous (P < 0.01) and visual analog scales showed
      less hunger, decreased appetite, and fewer sensations of pleasure related to
      eating, as compared with the other group (P < 0.01). Food intake reduction was
      also related to depressive mood and medical advice. However, there was no
      difference between groups in fecal energy wasting and resting energy expenditure.
      Weight loss in Crohn's disease may be due to a decrease in food intake rather
      than to an increase in energy cost of the disease. Thus, focus of attention on
      the diet is crucial to prevent malnutrition.

TI  - [Etiology of colorectal cancer].
PG  - 264-72
AB  - Colorectal cancer affect the 15% of general population in developed countries.
      Cancer is a multistep process in which multiple genetic alterations must usually 
      occur in several years. The premalignant step consists of one or multiple
      aberrant crypts due to hyperproliferation of cells and its shift from the deep
      third of the crypt to its surface. It has been suggested that abnormality in the 
      APC gene is responsible for this. Furthermore, there exists DNA hypometilation,
      activation of the gene K-ras and ornithine decarboxylase activity. There is also 
      a loss of MCC gene, that seems to interact with the APC gene. Entire alterations 
      described make possible the Class I adenoma formation. This adenoma, needs the
      loss of the DCC gene (late stage in the carcinogenesis process), to become a
      Class II adenoma. The following alteration is deleted and mutation of the p53
      gene. There is also an activation of the c-myc oncogene. These two genes are
      important mechanisms for the conversion of a benign adenoma to a malignant one,
      adenoma with in situ carcinoma or Class III adenoma. This type of adenoma becomes
      carcinoma and metastatic stage, throughout inactivation of several tumor
      suppressor genes. Besides the hereditary APC alteration and other acquired
      genetic changes as described above there are other associated genetics,
      antigenics, and enzymes that have an important role in the adenoma-carcinoma
      sequence. Several carcinogenic factors have been described which also contribute 
      in the adenoma and carcinoma formation: ulcerative colitis, acromegaly, familial 
      history of colonic neoplasia, certain professions, smoking and drinking,
      consumption of red or processed meat, etc.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

PG  - 166-71
AB  - A multisite, hospital-based, case-control study examined the risk of ulcerative
      colitis in relation to dietary factors, smoking and drinking habits, past history
      of diseases, and childhood factors. Information was obtained from
      self-administered patient questionnaires. Study subjects included 101 ulcerative 
      colitis patients who were 10-39 years old at the time of disease onset, which was
      within the previous 3 years, and 143 control subjects. Combined consumption of
      Western foods (bread for breakfast, butter, margarine, cheese, meats, and ham and
      sausage) was significantly related to an increased risk of ulcerative colitis
      (trend, p = 0.04). Margarine (as an individual Western food item) was positively 
      associated with ulcerative colitis (trend, p = 0.005). There was also a tendency 
      toward positive association of bread for breakfast with ulcerative colitis
      (trend, p = 0.07). The risk did not measurably vary with the consumption of
      typical Japanese foods, vegetables and fruits, confectioneries, or soft drinks.
      As compared with lifelong nonsmokers, current smokers tended to have a decreased 
      risk of ulcerative colitis and former smokers had an increased risk. There was no
      association between breastfeeding in infancy and the risk of ulcerative colitis.

AB  - Twelve patients with primary hypogammaglobulinaemia with diarrhoea not associated
      with known microbial pathogens were investigated. Histological evidence of
      inflammation was common in the stomach and jejunum. Moreover, eight of 10
      patients undergoing colonoscopy had low grade 'microscopic colitis' with raised
      intraepithelial lymphocytes and an intact crypt architecture. Five of 12 patients
      had small intestinal inflammation on 111indium leucocyte scintigrams and all had 
      increased faecal excretion (normal < 1%) of 111indium (over four days), which
      varied in intensity from mild (faecal excretion of 111indium = 1-3%) to that
      comparable with moderately active (7-14.5%) Crohn's disease. Three patients had
      small intestinal strictures superficially resembling Crohn's disease.
      Histologically, however, these lacked characteristic diagnostic features of
      Crohn's disease in two and the third patient had non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
      drug induced diaphragm like strictures. Six of seven who were most severely
      symptomatic were successfully treated with an elemental diet with rapid
      improvement of symptoms. The faecal excretion of 111indium was repeated in five
      and all improved but histologically the colitis remained unchanged. These studies
      show that some patients with primary hypogammaglobulinaemia have intestinal
      inflammation unlike that found in classic inflammatory bowel disease. Elemental
      diet is a useful temporary measure in the treatment of these patients.

TI  - Allergic colitis in infancy: clinical and pathologic aspects.
PG  - 22-6
AB  - This study prospectively evaluated 35 consecutive infants who presented with
      fresh blood mixed with stools. The mean age at onset of bleeding was
      approximately 4 weeks. All infants were otherwise asymptomatic and exhibited
      normal growth and physical examinations. None had evidence of a bleeding
      diathesis, viral or bacterial enteritis, or necrotizing enterocolitis. Consent
      for limited colonoscopy and biopsy was obtained for 34 infants. Twenty-five had
      macroscopic colitis and 10 infants had marked nodular lymphoid hyperplasia.
      Thirty-one infants had histopathological evidence of colitis characterized by a
      marked eosinophilic infiltrate. Compared with 19 controls (age, 4.1 +/- 3.6
      months) the mean number of eosinophils per high-power field was greater in the
      patients with colitis. Patients with colitis also had an elevated mean absolute
      peripheral eosinophil count and a low mean serum albumin compared to control
      values. The 31 infants with colitis were receiving solely breast milk (10), cow's
      milk formula (9), soya formula (9), breast milk with cow's milk formula (2), or
      nutramigen (1) at the time of presentation. Nineteen infants had rapid resolution
      of frank bleeding and gradual correction of serum albumin with dietary change.
      While limited colonoscopy and biopsy were useful in establishing a definitive
      diagnosis, a low serum albumin and high peripheral eosinophil count suggested the
      diagnosis. Colitis characterized histologically by > 20 eosinophils per
      high-power field is a common cause of rectal bleeding in otherwise healthy young 
      infants. Resolution of bleeding and increase in serum albumin after dietary
      change suggest that this is an allergic colitis: however, the pathogenesis of
      this disorder needs further clarification.

TI  - Milk tolerance in adults with ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 872-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: There has been concern in the literature and among physicians and
      patients that milk intolerance may contribute to disease activity in ulcerative
      colitis. We sought to define whether patients with ulcerative colitis have
      problems with milk tolerance. METHODS: 1) A questionnaire was administered to a
      group of gastroenterologists. 2) Consecutive unselected ulcerative colitis
      patients were administered a questionnaire regarding issues concerning their
      ingestion and tolerance of milk products. 3) Patients, and age- and ethnically
      matched controls, underwent lactose hydrogen breath testing at a 50-g dose, and
      if intolerant, returned for testing at a 12.5-g dose. RESULTS: Eighty percent of 
      responding physicians stated that they recommend avoidance of milk products at
      some time to their patients. Thirteen of 29 (44%) ulcerative colitis patients
      were lactose intolerant compared with five of 14 (36%) controls (p = 0.57). Of 11
      subjects returning for the 12.5-g test dose, only three (28%) were intolerant. Of
      10 ulcerative colitis patients tested during a flare, only two (20%) were
      intolerant. Nineteen of 28 (66%) patients reduced or eliminated milk products
      from their diet, but only 10 (45%) of these patients were lactose intolerant. The
      discordance rate for predicting lactose tolerance status among patients was 35%. 
      By logistic regression analysis, age (p = 0.04) and ethnicity (p = 0.006) were
      the only variables that were predictive of an abnormal lactose hydrogen breath
      test. CONCLUSIONS: There are common misperceptions among physicians and patients 
      about lactose intolerance in ulcerative colitis. Lactose intolerance in patients 
      with ulcerative colitis is dependent on their age and ethnicity and not any
      particular aspects of their disease. The proscription of milk products during
      flares of disease by many physicians is not supported by this study.

PG  - 115-22
AB  - Between 1974 and 1992, we perform 3,054 colonoscopies for diagnosis in 2,770
      patients, both of sexes, between the ages of 1 and 101 yr, most of them over the 
      fifth decade of life. In 300 procedures the bowel cleansing was made with the
      standard method of liquid diet and enemas, and in the other 2,754 with the oral
      administration of saline solution 9% with optimal results. We get the sedation of
      patients with the intravenous administration of diazepam 10mg, or pethidine 50
      mg, or midazolam 2.5 to 5 mg, and in children with ketamine and the
      anesthesiologist assistance. In 95% of the procedures we can see the cecum and
      the ileum; the diagnosis was abnormal in 52.78% of cases, normal in 45.20%, and
      insufficient in 02.02% specially for a bad cleansing of the bowel. In the
      abnormal group, the most frequent diseases we diagnose were: polyps, cancer,
      diverticular disease, and specific inflammatory disease of the bowel like TBC,
      radiation proctosigmoiditis, amebiasis, and non-specific bowel disease:
      "colitis", ulcerative proctocolitis, erosive colitis, and Crohn's disease.
      Colonoscopy is a very important method for diagnosis of colon diseases, alone or 
      complementary of double contrast X-ray of the colon.

TI  - The ileoanal reservoir: an alternative to ileostomy.
PG  - 120-5
AB  - The ileoanal reservoir, or ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, is a relatively new,
      innovative surgical approach offering normal sphincter preservation to clients
      with familial adenomatous polyposis and ulcerative colitis. In most patients, the
      ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is performed in two stages. In stage one, the ET
      nurse must address such patient-education issues as an understanding of the
      surgical procedure, care of the temporary ileostomy, diet and electrolyte
      balance, care of the perirectal skin, and the restrengthening of bowel control.
      Stage two ET nursing interventions focus on perianal skin care, use of
      medications, sphincter reeducation, and prompt recognition of complications.
      Written instructions offer the best method of providing crucial information
      succinctly. Patients require significant physical and emotional support
      throughout the potentially complex, long-term course until an optimal steady
      state is achieved.

TI  - Radiological investigation of chronic inflammatory bowel disease in childhood.
PG  - 101-19
AB  - The radiological investigations relevant to chronic IBD are described briefly
      with emphasis placed on compression techniques in small bowel studies. A
      classification for reporting small bowel Crohn's disease is proposed, where the
      disease is staged as early, advanced or complicated, and the extent of
      involvement measured directly from the film. The terminal ileum may be normal in 
      20% of children with proximal Crohn's disease, so that ileoscopy should not be
      used to exclude small bowel disease. Radiological assessment of the small bowel
      is important in management. Surgical referral was based on the radiological
      changes in 6% of patients, and in 24% the presence of extensive uncomplicated
      small bowel Crohn's disease led to treatment with elemental diet. The use of some
      specialized examinations, such as the instant and ileostomy enema, are discussed.

TI  - Crohn disease: early recognition and progress of aphthous lesions.
PG  - 451-4
AB  - PURPOSE: To clarify the radiographic appearance of the initial change an
      dprogression in Crohn disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1984 and 1992, nine
      patients (seven men and two women, aged 16-34 years; mean, 20 years) with Crohn
      disease, who had evidence of only aphthous erosions or ulcers at the initial
      examination, underwent repeated radiography for up to 7 years 11 months (median, 
      4 years). RESULTS: In all patients, the stomach, duodenum, small intestine, and
      colorectum were involved, and the esophagus was affected in three patients.
      Subsequently, four of the nine patients had lesions that progressed from aphthous
      lesions to overt Crohn disease, including ileitis in two patients, colitis in
      one, and ileocolitis in one. Time intervals between the first visit and the
      progression varied from 9 months to 3 years 6 months. In all eight patients who
      underwent nutritional treatment, regression of the lesions was recognized, but
      three of the lesions progressed during interruption of the nutritional diet.
      CONCLUSION: Crohn disease may initially appear as diffuse aphthous lesions in the
      gastrointestinal mucosa.

TI  - Amino acid losses in ileostomy fluid on a protein-free diet.
PG  - 70-3
AB  - The contribution of losses via the gastrointestinal tract to maintenance amino
      acid requirements was assessed by collecting the ileostomy fluid of volunteers
      given a protein-free diet for 5 d. The subjects were eight adult men and women
      with terminal ileum ileostomies after ulcerative colitis. Four consecutive 24-h
      collections of both digesta and urine were made. On the last 2 d an antibiotic
      was given that suppressed microbial activity in the digesta and slightly reduced 
      ileostomy outflow. Mean daily amino acid excretion in ileostomy fluid ranged from
      32 mg/d for methionine to approximately 330 mg/d for aspartate and glutamate.
      These losses were compared with current international estimates of amino acid
      requirements. For most essential amino acids gastrointestinal losses accounted
      for 14-33% of daily maintenance requirements but for threonine the contribution
      was 61%.

TI  - Effects of short chain fatty acids on gut morphology and function.
PG  - S35-8
AB  - Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are the products of colonic bacterial degradation
      of unabsorbed starch and non-starch polysaccharide (fibre). They are important
      anions in the colonic lumen, affecting both colonocyte morphology and function.
      The three main acids (acetate, propionate, and butyrate) stimulate colonic sodium
      and fluid absorption and exert proliferative effects on the colonocyte.
      Experimental animal studies have shown that they promote adaptive responses to
      small intestinal resection and colonic anastomosis. Acetate increases colonic
      blood flow and enhances ileal motility. Butyrate has been shown to be the
      preferred energy substrate for the colonocyte and to be a potent differentiating 
      agent in cell culture. Butyrate may also have a role in preventing certain types 
      of colitis. A diet low in resistant starch and fibre, which will result in a low 
      production of SCFAs in the colon, may explain the high occurrence of colonic
      disorders seen in the Western civilization.

TI  - Analysis of disease distribution, activity and complications in the patient with

PG  - 15-9
AB  - Management strategies in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis should be based
      on up-to-date information on disease distribution, extent, activity and
      complications. A system of structured analysis is suggested, with separate
      consideration of destructive ulceration, inflammatory activity and other factors.
      Direct investigation of gut immunity by using whole gut lavage fluid (WGLF) is a 
      valuable new technique of clinical investigation in IBD and related disorders.
      Recent studies have shown that the concentrations of plasma-derived proteins in
      WGLF provide objective measures of disease activity; and that this activity is a 
      separate phenomenon from destructive ulceration and fibrosis. Neutrophils in the 
      lumen can be in- investigated by cytology, or by assay of neutrophil elastase in 
      WGLF. Cytokines and other immuno-regulatory mediators can also be detected. These
      new techniques can provide a description of intestinal immunity and inflammation,
      based on a non-invasive test of 2-4 h duration. Work in progress shows that
      patients who respond clinically to elemental diet treatment have unusually high
      concentrations of soluble IL2 receptor in WGLF; cytokine profiles may facilitate 
      the selection of patients suitable for other new treatment modalities.

PG  - 139-46
AB  - Ileal-pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) following coloproctectomy avoids permanent
      ileostomy, and allows complete excision of diseased mucosa in ulcerative colitis 
      (UC) and adenomatous polyposis. Preserving normal intestinal pattern, the goal of
      IPAA is to improve quality of life for patients. This study was designed to
      measure the impact of IPAA on quality of life in a series of 35 surgically
      treated UC. Four fields of quality of life were explored: diet, professional
      activity, sport practice, sexual activity. Interview with independent observer
      and prospective follow-up allowed to establish a score from 0 (excellent quality 
      of life) to 19 (bad quality of life). In the same time, functional score
      evaluating pouch evacuation and continence was established (0 = excellent
      function, 30 = bad function) to be compared to quality of life. The series
      included 35 IPAA in function for more than 6 months (mean follow-up = 46 +/- 31
      months), performed for UC (14 females and 21 males, mean age: 34 y-a).
      Respectively 30 (86%) and 5 (14%) of the patients had an excellent and fair
      quality of life, according to the scoring system: 25 had no diet, all but one had
      a normal professional activity and all were satisfied of sport practice; 33 had
      no sexual disturbances related to IPAA, but 3 female patients complained of
      infertility. Functional results were excellent, fair and bad respectively in 25
      (72%), 9 (26%) and 1 patients: stool frequency was 4.6 +/- 2 per day, 60% of
      patients having no nocturnal emission, and 90% being able to delay for more than 
      1 hour.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Serum interleukin-8 in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 508-12
AB  - To investigate the relationship between serum concentrations of interleukin-8
      (IL-8) and disease activity in inflammatory bowel disease, serum IL-8
      concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 93
      patients. Interleukin-8 levels were compared with plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6)
      levels in 80 of these patients. Interleukin-8 levels were also measured in ten
      patients with active Crohn's disease, before and after treatment with a defined
      formula polymeric diet. Of these patients, 70 out of 93 IL-8 concentrations were 
      below the detection limit of the assay. Levels were higher in patients with
      active ulcerative colitis (median < 20 pg/mL, 75th centile value = 190) compared 
      with inactive disease (median and 75th centile value < 20; P < 0.05).
      Interleukin-8 concentrations correlated with a combined score for disease
      severity and extent (P = 0.01). Thirty-eight per cent (8/20) of patients with
      active Crohn's disease also had high levels of IL-8 but there was no significant 
      difference between active and inactive disease. There was no correlation between 
      serum IL-8 and plasma IL-6; on the contrary, very few patients had raised blood
      levels of both cytokines. In the diet treated group, serum IL-8 fell
      significantly after treatment (median = 37 pg/mL, range < 20-4615 before
      treatment, median < 20, range < 20-104 after treatment; P = 0.03). The results
      suggest that although IL-8 may be involved in the inflammatory process in
      inflammatory bowel disease, it is a poor marker of disease activity.

TI  - [Experience with biofragmentable anastomotic rings].
PG  - 263-4, 328
AB  - During 1991-92 we performed 50 bowel anastomoses using the biofragmentable
      anastomotic ring (BAR). The indications were malignancy (35 cases), Crohn's
      disease (3), dolichosigma (4), diverticulitis (2), gastric outlet obstruction
      (2), and 1 each for abdominal trauma, postoperative stricture, and stricture
      caused by ischemic colitis. The average age was 61; 28 were women and 22 men. The
      anastomoses were between colon and rectum (21 cases), ileum and colon (18), colon
      and colon (8), stomach and jejunum (2) and ileum and ileum (1). First stools were
      passed after an average of 4.7 +/- 2.5 (SD) days and a low-residue diet was
      well-tolerated after an average of 7 +/- 3.9 days. There were complications in 12
      (24%). In 3 others leaks necessitated reoperation. Incomplete small bowel
      obstruction developed in 6, 4-18 days after operation and lasted 3-11 days. In 2 
      a perianastomotic inflammation appeared 1-3 weeks after operation and was treated
      successfully with IV antibiotics and bowel rest. In 1 case a stricture appeared 3
      months after surgery and was treated successfully with balloon dilatation. No
      complications were seen after anastomosing bowel segments proximal to the
      ileocecal valve. The average time for expelling the BAR in 19 of the 45 patients 
      was 2.5 +/- 0.6 weeks, assessed by weekly X-raying of the abdomen. Although the
      group of patients was small, our impression is that the method of anastomosis is 
      easy to learn, easy to perform and relatively safe.

AB  - Disturbances in zinc metabolism have been documented in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease. In this study we evaluated the effect of in vivo
      treatment with zinc on the in vitro natural killer cell activity in thirteen
      inflammatory bowel disease patients, with stable disease and mild-moderate
      disease activity, in a double-blind randomized cross-over trial. The results of
      our study show a long-lasting effect of in vivo zinc administration, which
      decreased peripheral blood natural killer cell activity in inflammatory bowel
      disease.

TI  - Life quality and psychological morbidity with an ileostomy.
PG  - 252-3
AB  - The recent introduction of restorative proctocolectomy for the treatment of
      ulcerative colitis has reopened the debate about the effects of ileostomy on
      quality of life. This study analysed life quality and psychological morbidity in 
      113 patients with an ileostomy using a postal questionnaire which included
      questions about their opinion of the pouch operation. Of the questionnaires, 73
      per cent were suitable for analysis. A total of 93 per cent of those responding
      were happy with the ileostomy and appeared to have adapted to a normal life with 
      it. Some 87 per cent stated that they would keep the ileostomy in preference to
      an ileoanal pouch. In addition, psychological morbidity as assessed by the
      General Health Questionnaire occurred in only 5 per cent of patients.

TI  - Red blood cell folate is associated with the development of dysplasia and cancer 
      in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 549-54
AB  - Patients with extensive ulcerative colitis have a high risk of developing colon
      cancer. The etiology of mucosal dysplasia, a premalignant lesion that is used as 
      a screening test in surveillance programs, is unknown. Previously, a case-control
      study [Lashner et al. (1989) Gastroenterology 97:255-259] suggested that folate
      supplementation was associated with a 62% reduction in the risk of developing
      dysplasia or cancer. The current case-control study was performed to obtain a
      better definition of this risk. All 67 patients with chronic ulcerative
      pancolitis having surveillance colonoscopy during a 1-year period were entered.
      There were 6 cases (4 with dysplasia and 2 with cancer) and 61 controls (no
      cancer or dysplasia). Red blood cell folate, reflecting intermediate-term stores,
      was a mean of 66.2 ng/ml lower in cases compared to controls. Serum folate,
      reflecting short-term stores, was not different between groups. Adjusting for
      confounding effects of age, sex, race, disease duration, and folate
      supplementation, the risk of dysplasia or cancer was significantly decreased by
      18% for each 10 ng/ml increase in red blood cell folate (odds ratio 0.82, 95%
      confidence interval 0.68-0.99). Vitamins A, D, and E and carotene were lower in
      cases than in controls, but no water-soluble vitamin other than red blood cell
      folate was associated with an increased cancer risk. Depressed red blood cell
      folate is associated with an increased risk of dysplasia and cancer in patients
      with ulcerative colitis and may be a risk factor for neoplastic transformation.

PG  - 992-5
AB  - Ulcerative colitis is an illness that occurs unexpectedly in a young patient,
      with a generally unpredictable prognosis, and there is no medication to cure it. 
      This illness profoundly impairs the patient's professional life, family life, sex
      life, leading to an overall change in lifestyle, most particularly in cases of
      pancolitis. The majority of patients who benefit from a total colectomy for their
      ulcerative colitis, are those whose cases are severe, chronic, incapacitating,
      and who respond poorly to prolonged, appropriately administered medical
      treatment, mainly continuous steroid therapy. After the surgical procedure, the
      average number of defecations is from 5 to 6 evacuations in 24 hours, and the
      anal continence is good. Around 5% of patients have nocturnal leakage requiring
      to wear a protecting fad. Globally 9 out 10 patients are satisfied with their
      surgery and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is the procedure of choice for the
      treatment of ulcerative colitis in subjects under 60 years of age, with a normal 
      anal sphincter function and without neoplastic complication of the lower rectum.
