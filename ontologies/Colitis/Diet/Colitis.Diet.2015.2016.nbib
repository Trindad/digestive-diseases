AB  - INTRODUCTION: The ESPEN guideline presents a multidisciplinary focus on clinical 
      nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODOLOGY: The guideline is
      based on extensive systematic review of the literature, but relies on expert
      opinion when objective data were lacking or inconclusive. The conclusions and 64 
      recommendations have been subject to full peer review and a Delphi process in
      which uniformly positive responses (agree or strongly agree) were required.
      RESULTS: IBD is increasingly common and potential dietary factors in its
      aetiology are briefly reviewed. Malnutrition is highly prevalent in IBD -
      especially in Crohn's disease. Increased energy and protein requirements are
      observed in some patients. The management of malnutrition in IBD is considered
      within the general context of support for malnourished patients. Treatment of
      iron deficiency (parenterally if necessary) is strongly recommended. Routine
      provision of a special diet in IBD is not however supported. Parenteral nutrition
      is indicated only when enteral nutrition has failed or is impossible. The
      recommended perioperative management of patients with IBD undergoing surgery
      accords with general ESPEN guidance for patients having abdominal surgery.
      Probiotics may be helpful in UC but not Crohn's disease. Primary therapy using
      nutrition to treat IBD is not supported in ulcerative colitis, but is moderately 
      well supported in Crohn's disease, especially in children where the adverse
      consequences of steroid therapy are proportionally greater. However, exclusion
      diets are generally not recommended and there is little evidence to support any
      particular formula feed when nutritional regimens are constructed. CONCLUSIONS:
      Available objective data to guide nutritional support and primary nutritional
      therapy in IBD are presented as 64 recommendations, of which 9 are very strong
      recommendations (grade A), 22 are strong recommendations (grade B) and 12 are
      based only on sparse evidence (grade 0); 21 recommendations are good practice
      points (GPP).

      pouchitis with an evidence-based treatment algorithm.
PG  - 581-592
LID - 10.1111/apt.13905 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) 
      is considered the procedure of choice in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC)
      refractory to medical therapy. The incidence of pouchitis is 40% at 5 years. Ten 
      to 15% of patients with pouchitis experience chronic pouchitis. AIM: To determine
      the efficacy of medical therapies for the treatment of chronic refractory
      pouchitis in patients undergoing IPAA for UC. METHODS: A systematic
      computer-assisted search of the on-line bibliographic database MEDLINE and EMBASE
      was performed between 1966 and February 2016. All original studies reporting
      remission rates following medical treatment for chronic pouchitis were included. 
      All study designs were considered. Remission was defined according to the
      individual study. Remission endpoints ranged from 15 days to 10 weeks. Chronic
      pouchitis was defined by each study. RESULTS: Twenty-one papers were considered
      eligible. Results from all studies combined suggested that overall remission was 
      obtained in 59% of patients (95% CI: 44-73%). Antibiotics significantly induced
      remission in patients with chronic pouchitis with 74% remission rate (95%
      CI:56-93%), (P < 0.001). Biologics significantly induced remission in patients
      with chronic pouchitis with 53% remission rate (95% CI:30-76%), (P < 0.001).
      Steroids, bismuth, elemental diet and tacrolimus all can induce remission but
      failed to achieve significance. Faecal microbiota transplantation in a single
      study was not found to achieve remission. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of chronic
      refractory pouchitis remains difficult and is largely empirical. Larger
      randomised controlled trials will help aid the management of chronic pouchitis.

AB  - Among the neoplasias, colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer
      death in men and women. The increasing incidence of this type of cancer is due to
      the increase in the population's life expectancy, by the increase in chronic
      inflammatory bowel diseases, primarily ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease,
      and the change in eating habits. The American Cancer Society (2011) shows that
      diet might be responsible for approximately 30% of cancer cases in developed
      countries, moreover when considering only colorectal cancer, the number can reach
      30% to 50%. Probiotics are effective in the prevention and treatment of many
      bowel diseases as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), diarrhea, irritable bowel
      syndrome, gluten intolerance, gastroenteritis, Helicobacter pyloriinfection, and 
      colon cancer. Classical examples are strains from the Lactobacillus, and
      Bifidobacteriumgenus that have probiotic proprieties with a potential use in the 
      prophylaxis, as well as in the treatment of a variety of gastrointestinal tract
      disorders. Researchers are focusing on extremely important studies regarding the 
      possibility of using probiotics to promote a balanced microbiota composition, and
      a sufficient immunological surveillance system as a way to prevent cancer.
      Considering the fact that the human intestines host 100 trillion bacteria,
      including more than 1,000 species, there is still need to perform more in depth
      investigations in order to find probiotics with potential to prevent, and treat
      cancerous diseases, adding a very promising effect to this already successful
      panorama. This revision aims to conduct a review of the most recent studies
      correlating probiotics and its cancer preventing and treatment potential.

TI  - Nutritional Wheat Amylase-Trypsin Inhibitors Promote Intestinal Inflammation via 
      Activation of Myeloid Cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Wheat amylase-trypsin inhibitors (ATIs) are nutritional
      activators of innate immunity, via activation of the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) 
      on myeloid cells. We aimed to characterize the biologic activity of ATIs in
      various foods and their effect on intestinal inflammation. METHODS: We selected
      38 different gluten-containing and gluten-free products, either unprocessed (such
      as wheat, rye, barley, quinoa, amaranth, soya, lentils, and rice) or processed
      (such as pizza, pasta, bread, and biscuits). ATIs were extracted and their
      biological activities determined in TLR4-responsive mouse and human cell lines.
      Effects of oral ATIs on intestinal inflammation were determined in healthy
      C57BL/6 mice on a gluten-free or ATI-free diet and in mice given low-level
      polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid or dextran sodium sulfate to induce colitis.
      Parameters of innate and adaptive immune activation were determined in duodenum, 
      ileum, colon, and mesenteric lymph nodes. RESULTS: Modern gluten-containing
      staples had levels of TLR4-activating ATIs that were as much as 100-fold higher
      than in most gluten-free foods. Processed or baked foods retained ATI
      bioactivity. Most older wheat variants (such as Emmer or Einkorn) had lower
      bioactivity than modern (hexaploid) wheat. ATI species CM3 and 0.19 were the most
      prevalent activators of TLR4 in modern wheat and were highly resistant to
      intestinal proteolysis. Their ingestion induced modest intestinal myeloid cell
      infiltration and activation, and release of inflammatory mediators-mostly in the 
      colon, then in the ileum, and then in the duodenum. Dendritic cells became
      prominently activated in mesenteric lymph nodes. Concentrations of ATIs found in 
      a normal daily gluten-containing diet increased low-level intestinal
      inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Gluten-containing cereals have by far the highest
      concentrations of ATIs that activate TLR4. Orally ingested ATIs are largely
      resistant to proteases and heat, and increase intestinal inflammation by
      activating gut and mesenteric lymph node myeloid cells.

AB  - Although the gastrointestinal tract contains intrinsic neural plexuses that allow
      a significant degree of independent control over gastrointestinal functions, the 
      central nervous system provides extrinsic neural inputs that modulate, regulate, 
      and integrate these functions. In particular, the vagus nerve provides the
      parasympathetic innervation to the gastrointestinal tract, coordinating the
      complex interactions between central and peripheral neural control mechanisms.
      This review discusses the physiological roles of the afferent (sensory) and motor
      (efferent) vagus in regulation of appetite, mood, and the immune system, as well 
      as the pathophysiological outcomes of vagus nerve dysfunction resulting in
      obesity, mood disorders, and inflammation. The therapeutic potential of vagus
      nerve modulation to attenuate or reverse these pathophysiological outcomes and
      restore autonomic homeostasis is also discussed.

AB  - Diverticulosis is defined by the presence of diverticula due to herniation of
      mucosa and muscularis mucosa through the muscularis propria at sites of vascular 
      penetration in the colon and is asymptomatic in the vast majority affected. There
      are global differences of distribution, in Western industrialized societies, the 
      most common site is in the left colon, but in Asia right sided diverticulosis
      predominates. Whilst present in 17.5% of a general population and 42% of all
      comers at endoscopy it is seen in 71% of those aged >/=80 years. Diverticular
      disease is defined as clinically significant and symptomatic diverticulosis,
      which may have an absence of macroscopically overt colitis and in true
      diverticulitis there is macroscopic inflammation of diverticula with related
      acute or chronic complications. Whilst overall, diverticulitis affects only 4% of
      those with diverticulosis, in younger patients (aged 40-49 years) this peaks at
      11%. Diverticulosis is one of the most common chronic diseases, yet research in
      this field on pathogenesis has lagged behind other common conditions such as
      diabetes mellitus. However, in the last decade there have been major advances in 
      taxonomy that can be used to relate to patients' outcome and treatment in both
      medicine and surgery. It has been shown there is an association with age, diet,
      drugs and smoking. Genetic studies have shown a familial association and a
      specific gene, TNFSF 15 may predict severity of disease. The role of the
      microbiome has been explored and microbial and metabolomic signatures are also
      important in predicting disease severity. That diverticulosis is a chronic
      disease is shown by mucosal pathology with subtle chronic inflammation present in
      those with asymptomatic diverticulosis and inflammation may lead to muscular
      hypertrophy, enteric nerve remodeling with disordered motility. The
      diverticulitis quality of life instrument shows that this condition impacts
      markedly on patients' well-being and prevention and amelioration of complications
      should be the aim of treatment and further research to attain this goal is
      needed.

AB  - Geographic patterns with diminishing rates from north to south toward the equator
      have been described for a number of diseases, putatively related largely to
      "western" lifestyle. Among these the inflammatory bowel diseases; Crohn's (CD)
      and Ulcerative colitis (UC) have been prominent in sharing distributions with a
      number of autoimmune diseases. One of the interesting associations is the
      epidemiologic similarity with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, in addition, at
      least some of these diseases also correlated inversely with lactase non
      persistent population (LNP) distributions. It is hypothesized that MS should also
      have an inverse relationship with LNP. We provide support for this by comparing
      published MS, CD, UC and LNP national rates to the beginning of the new
      millennium. Possible links among these diseases may be an evolutionary signature 
      of new genes which may have accompanied emergence of lactase persistence
      millennia ago. The emergent phenotypic dichotomy also forced different
      assimilation responses to lactose digestion. While intestinal retention of
      lactase results in direct host enzymatic digestion, in LNP persons intestinal
      bacterial metabolism of lactose impacts on the host micro-flora. These microbial 
      changes may play some role in altering rates of diseases including IBD and MS.
      However, since the late 20th century previously observed patterns are changing.
      Although industrialization is considered to play an important modifying role, the
      rising rates of obesity with an emphasis on diet, and microfloral pathogenesis,
      but with an independent geographic pattern may also facilitate altering rates and
      geographic distributions of both of these and other diseases.

TI  - Prebiotics and synbiotics in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 477-485
LID - 10.1080/00365521.2016.1263680 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the
      colon with unclear pathogenesis. A dysbiotic intestinal microbiota is regarded as
      a key component in the disease process and there has been significant interest in
      developing new treatments which target the microbiota. AIM: To give an overview
      of the studies to date investigating prebiotics and synbiotics for the treatment 
      of UC. METHODS: A literature search of PubMed and related search engines was
      carried out using the terms "ulcerative colitis" in combination with "prebiotic",
      "synbiotic" or "dietary fibre". RESULTS: In total 17 studies on humans examining 
      the effect of prebiotics in UC were found. Five major groups could be
      distinguished. Fructo-oligosaccharides were tried in six studies (mean 35
      patients included, range 9-121). One study found a clinical response while two
      demonstrated indirect evidence of an effect. Germinated barley foodstuff was used
      in 8 studies (mean 38 patients, range 10-63). One study found an endoscopic
      response, while four noted a clinical response and two some indirect effects.
      Galacto-oligosaccharides, lactulose and resveratrol were used in one study each
      (mean 48 patients, range 41-52). One study found an endoscopic response and one a
      clinical response. CONCLUSION: There is yet inadequate evidence - especially in
      humans - to support any particular prebiotic in the clinical management of UC.
      However, due to the bulk of evidence supporting the effect of the microbiota on
      colonic inflammation, there is enough potential to justify further high-quality
      clinical trials investigating this subject.

TI  - Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's Disease Are Associated with Decreased Serum
      Selenium Concentrations and Increased Cardiovascular Risk.
LID - E780 [pii]
AB  - The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and associated oxidative stress
      is increasing. The antioxidant mineral selenium (Se) was measured in serum
      samples from 106 IBD patients (53 with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 53 with
      Crohn's disease (CD)) and from 30 healthy controls. Serum Se concentrations were 
      significantly lower in UC and CD patients than in healthy controls (p < 0.001)
      and significantly lower in CD patients than in UC patients (p = 0.006). Se
      concentrations in patients were significantly influenced by sex, body mass index 
      (BMI), the inflammatory biomarker alpha-1-antitrypsin, surgery, medical
      treatment, the severity, extent, and form of the disease and the length of time
      since onset (p < 0.05). Se concentrations in IBD patients were positively and
      linearly correlated with nutritional (protein, albumin, prealbumin,
      cholinesterase and total cholesterol) and iron status-related (hemoglobin, Fe and
      hematocrit) parameters (p < 0.05). A greater impairment of serum Se and
      cardiovascular status was observed in CD than in UC patients. An adequate
      nutritional Se status is important in IBD patients to minimize the cardiovascular
      risk associated with increased inflammation biomarkers, especially in
      undernourished CD patients, and is also related to an improved nutritional and
      body iron status.

TI  - Fermented barley and soybean (BS) mixture enhances intestinal barrier function in
      dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model.
PG  - 498
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by chronic or
      relapsing immune system activation and inflammation within the gastrointestinal
      tract. The lack of safety and efficacy of standard therapies, the use of food
      supplements for managing IBD is increasing, and many studies have reported that
      various food supplements provide many beneficial effects for the IBD. METHODS:
      This study aimed to evaluate the anti-colitis effects of dietary supplementation 
      with a fermented barley and soybean mixture (BS) on intestinal inflammation using
      a murine model of IBD. Female C57BL/6 mice were administered with either BS (100 
      and 200 mg/kg/day) or vehicle (PBS) control through oral gavages for 3 days and
      received 5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) drinking water to induce colitis. Mice
      body weight was measured every two days and disease activity index (DAI) score
      was determined on Day 15; mice were sacrificed and colons were analyzed by H & E 
      staining and RT-PCR. We also measured intestinal barrier function in vitro using 
      DSS-treated Caco-2 cells by assessing ZO-1 immunofluorescence staining and
      Western blotting and in vivo by measuring serum level of FITC-Dextran and by
      performing bacteria culture from mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) extract. The gut
      microbiota was examined by real time PCR using fecal DNA. RESULTS: We found that 
      BS alleviated the severity of colitis in a DSS-induced colitis mouse model, and
      suppressed levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in colonic tissue. Moreover, BS
      prevented epithelial barrier dysfunction, inducing an increase of tight junction 
      protein levels in colonic tissues, BS also inhibited FITC-dextran permeability,
      and suppressed bacterial translocation to MLNs. In addition, BS increased the
      levels of Lactobacilli and Bacteroides, which have anti-inflammatory properties. 
      CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that BS has protective roles against inflammatory 
      bowel disease through changes in inflammatory activity, tight junction protein
      expression, and gut microbiota composition in DSS-induced colitis.

AB  - Despite the accepted health benefits of consuming dietary fiber, little is known 
      about the mechanisms by which fiber deprivation impacts the gut microbiota and
      alters disease risk. Using a gnotobiotic mouse model, in which animals were
      colonized with a synthetic human gut microbiota composed of fully sequenced
      commensal bacteria, we elucidated the functional interactions between dietary
      fiber, the gut microbiota, and the colonic mucus barrier, which serves as a
      primary defense against enteric pathogens. We show that during chronic or
      intermittent dietary fiber deficiency, the gut microbiota resorts to
      host-secreted mucus glycoproteins as a nutrient source, leading to erosion of the
      colonic mucus barrier. Dietary fiber deprivation, together with a fiber-deprived,
      mucus-eroding microbiota, promotes greater epithelial access and lethal colitis
      by the mucosal pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium. Our work reveals intricate
      pathways linking diet, the gut microbiome, and intestinal barrier dysfunction,
      which could be exploited to improve health using dietary therapeutics.

TI  - Nutrition, oxidative stress and intestinal dysbiosis: Influence of diet on gut
      microbiota in inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 461-466
LID - 10.5507/bp.2016.052 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microbiota refers to the population of microorganisms (bacteria,
      viruses and fungi) that inhabit the entire gastrointestinal tract, more
      particularly the colon whose role is to maintain the integrity of the intestinal 
      mucosa and control the proliferation of pathogenic bacteria. Alteration in the
      composition of the gut microbiota is called dysbiosis. Dysbiosis redisposes to
      inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease and
      indeterminate colitis. METHODS: The purpose of this literature review is to
      elucidate the influence of diet on the composition of the gastrointestinal
      microbiota in the healthy gut and the role of diet in the development of
      dysbiosis. CONCLUSION: The "Western diet", in particular a low - fiber high
      fat/high carbohydrate diet is one factor that can lead to severe dysbiosis. In
      contrast, "mediterranean" and vegetarian diets that includes abundant fruits,
      vegetables, olive oil and oily fish are known for their anti-inflammatory effects
      and could prevent dysbiosis and subsequent inflammatory bowel disease.

AB  - Non-IgE-mediated gastrointestinal food allergic disorders (non-IgE-GI-FA)
      including food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES), food
      protein-induced enteropathy (FPE), and food protein-induced allergic
      proctocolitis (FPIAP) are relatively uncommon in infants and young children, but 
      are likely under-diagnosed. Non-IgE-GI-FA have a favorable prognosis, with
      majority resolving by age 3-5 years. Diagnosis relies on the recognition of
      symptoms pattern in FPIAP and FPIES and biopsy in FPE. Further studies are needed
      for a better understanding of the pathomechanism, which will lead eventually to
      the development of diagnostic tests and treatments. Limited evidence supports the
      role of food allergens in subsets of constipation, gastroesophageal reflux
      disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and colic. The immunologic pathomechanism is
      not fully understood and empiric prolonged avoidance of food allergens should be 
      limited to minimize nutrient deficiency and feeding disorders/food aversions in
      infants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prebiotic dietary fibers resist digestion in the upper
      gastrointestinal tract and allow for stimulation of bacteria in the distal
      intestine and colon. Stimulation of bacteria among different individuals varies
      greatly, depending on a wide range of variables. OBJECTIVE: To determine the
      range of differences in response between individuals, a preclinical in vitro
      fermentation was conducted with six fecal donors. The primary objective was to
      compare the fecal microbiota of six individuals at baseline, 12 h and 24 h
      post-exposure to partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG). METHOD: Fecal donations
      were collected from six healthy individuals consuming a non-specific Western
      diet, free of antibiotic treatments in the past year, not affected by any GI
      diseases and not consuming any probiotic or prebiotic supplements. Fecal samples 
      were exposed to 0.5 g of PHGG and measured for bacterial changes at 0, 12 and 24 
      h based on 16S rRNA sequencing. RESULTS: Parabacteroides increased from 3.48% of 
      sequence reads to 10.62% of sequence reads after 24 h (p = 0.0181) and
      Bacteroidetes increased from 45.89% of sequence reads to 50.29% of sequence reads
      (p = 0.0008). CONCLUSIONS: PHGG stimulates growth of Parabacteroides, a genus of 
      bacteria that have been inversely associated with IBS and ulcerative colitis.
      PHGG provides stimulation of beneficial Bacteroidetes (Bacteroides and
      Parabacteroides), which may be correlated with many positive health markers and
      outcomes. PHGG is a prebiotic dietary fiber that is readily fermentable.

TI  - The association between the intake of specific dietary components and lifestyle
      factors and microscopic colitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The incidence of microscopic colitis (MC) has increased
      over the previous decades. In addition to smoking and drugs, currently
      unidentified environmental factors may have a role. The aim of this study was to 
      determine whether specific dietary or other lifestyle factors were associated
      with the development of MC. SUBJECT/METHODS: The population-based cohort Malmo
      Diet and Cancer Study of 28 095 individuals was examined. Information about
      dietary habits was collected by a modified diet history method. Data on
      anthropometry were measured, and socio-economic and lifestyle factors were
      collected by questionnaires. Cases of MC were identified in medical registers.
      Associations were estimated using Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: During a
      22-year period, 135 patients were diagnosed with MC. Intakes of protein,
      carbohydrates, sucrose, saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, 
      omega-3 or omega-6 fatty acids, fibre and zinc were not associated with MC. We
      could verify the previously reported association between MC and smoking (hazard
      ratio (HR): 2.29; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.66-3.84) and the female gender 
      (HR: 3.57; 95% CI: 2.22-5.74). High alcohol consumption was associated with an
      increased risk for MC (HR: 1.89 for the highest quartile; 95% CI: 0.82-4.33, P
      for trend=0.032). In a post hoc analysis, alcohol intake including all patients
      independently of consumption seemed to reduce the smoking-related risk.
      CONCLUSIONS: Despite a large cohort and a long follow-up period, we could not
      detect any dietary risk factors for MC. The aetiological mechanisms behind the
      positive impact of smoking and alcohol on MC risk should be investigated.

AB  - The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are contemporary conditions of
      industrialized societies. The prevalence of IBD continues to increase steadily in
      Western countries, and newly industrialized countries have a rapidly increasing
      incidence. The global spread of IBD appears to associate with Westernization of
      diets and environments, which affects the intestinal microbiome and increases the
      risk of IBD in genetically susceptible individuals. It is important to increase
      our understanding of these events to slow progression of IBD. We present a
      long-term plan to develop interventions that slow or stop the global increase in 
      the incidence of IBD.

AB  - The most common question asked by patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) 
      is, "Doctor, what should I eat?" Findings from epidemiology studies have
      indicated that diets high in animal fat and low in fruits and vegetables are the 
      most common pattern associated with an increased risk of IBD. Low levels of
      vitamin D also appear to be a risk factor for IBD. In murine models, diets high
      in fat, especially saturated animal fats, also increase inflammation, whereas
      supplementation with omega 3 long-chain fatty acids protect against intestinal
      inflammation. Unfortunately, omega 3 supplements have not been shown to decrease 
      the risk of relapse in patients with Crohn's disease. Dietary intervention
      studies have shown that enteral therapy, with defined formula diets, helps
      children with Crohn's disease and reduces inflammation and dysbiosis. Although
      fiber supplements have not been shown definitively to benefit patients with IBD, 
      soluble fiber is the best way to generate short-chain fatty acids such as
      butyrate, which has anti-inflammatory effects. Addition of vitamin D and curcumin
      has been shown to increase the efficacy of IBD therapy. There is compelling
      evidence from animal models that emulsifiers in processed foods increase risk for
      IBD. We discuss current knowledge about popular diets, including the specific
      carbohydrate diet and diet low in fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides
      and polyols. We present findings from clinical and basic science studies to help 
      gastroenterologists navigate diet as it relates to the management of IBD.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Both science and patients associate diet with inflammatory
      bowel disease [IBD]. There is no doubt that links between IBD and diet are
      numerous, based on both epidemiological studies and experimental studies.
      However, scientific evidence to support dietary advice is currently lacking, and 
      dietary counselling for IBD patients is often limited in clinical practice to the
      improvement of nutrient intake. This review aimed to focus on both patient's
      beliefs about and molecular mechanisms for crosstalk between nutrients and
      inflammation. METHODS: A literature search using PubMed was performed to identify
      relevant studies on diet and/or nutrients and their role in IBD. Pubmed [from
      inception to January 20, 2016] was searched using the terms: 'Crohn', 'colitis','
      intestinal epithelial cells', and a list of terms relating to diet or numerous
      specific nutrients. Terms associated with nutrients were individually tested in
      the context of IBD. Reference lists from studies selected were manually searched 
      to identify further relevant reports. Manuscripts about diet in the context of
      IBD from basic science, epidemiological studies, or clinical trials were selected
      and reviewed. Only articles published in English were included. RESULTS:
      Epidemiological studies highlight the key role of diet in IBD development, and
      many IBD patients report diet as a triggering factor in relapse of disease. In
      addition, we present research on the impact of nutrients on innate immunity.
      CONCLUSION: Diet may offer an alternative approach to restoring deficient innate 
      immunity in IBD, and this may be the scientific rationale for providing dietary
      counselling for IBD patients.

TI  - Changes in Biosimilar Knowledge among European Crohn's Colitis Organization
      [ECCO] Members: An Updated Survey.
PG  - 1362-1365
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2013, a ECCO survey showed that a minority of IBD specialists was 
      aware and confident about the benefits and issues of biosimilars. We aimed to
      look at the evolution of IBD specialists' thinking about biosimilars one year
      after they had become available in the European Union. METHODS: A 14-question
      anonymous survey was posted on the ECCO website. Members voluntarily responded in
      response to ECCO office invitations to participate in their surveys. Information 
      on gender, job position, country, and experience with biologics also were
      collected. RESULTS: Out of the 118 responders, only 17% of responders had no
      access to biosimilars. Most responders regarded cost-sparing [92.4%] as the main 
      advantage of biosimilars, considered immunogenicity [69%] to be their main
      concern, and estimated that post-marketing pharmacovigilance, well-designed
      randomized clinical trials and further studies of risk profile were needed
      [30.5%, 27%, 32.2%, respectively, a 30-40% reduction since 2013]. Only 35% of
      physicians think biosimilars should carry distinct International Nonproprietary
      Names, as compared with 66% in 2013, and 89.8% disagreed with automatic
      substitution of the originator with a biosimilar by a pharmacist. The originator 
      and biosimilar were considered interchangeable by 44.4% of responders, as
      compared with 6% in 2013. Only 32.2% were against the extrapolation across
      indications, and only 25% would not extrapolate data across IBD. Finally, only
      19.5% felt little or no confidence in the use of biosimilars, as compared with
      63% in 2013. CONCLUSION: IBD specialists are generally well informed and educated
      about biosimilars. Compared with in 2013, there are now fewer concerns and more
      confidence about their use in clinical practice.

TI  - Coordinated Hospital-Home Fecal Microbiota Transplantation via Percutaneous
      Endoscopic Cecostomy for Recurrent Steroid-Dependent Ulcerative Colitis.
PG  - 975-980
LID - 10.5009/gnl15456 [doi]
AB  - Since its introduction as an alternative intestinal microbiota alteration
      approach, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been increasingly used as a 
      treatment of choice for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), but no reports
      exist regarding FMT via percutaneous endoscopic cecostomy (PEC). This report
      describes the case of a 24-year-old man with a 7-year history of recurrent,
      steroid-dependent UC. He received FMT via PEC once per day for 1 month in the
      hospital. After the remission of gastrointestinal symptoms, he was discharged
      from the hospital and continued FMT via PEC twice per week for 3 months at home. 
      The frequency of stools decreased, and the characteristics of stools improved
      soon thereafter. Enteral nutrition was regained after 1 week, and an oral diet
      was begun 1 month later. Two months after the FMT end point, the patient resumed 
      a normal diet, with formed soft stools once per day. The follow-up colonoscopy
      showed normal mucus membranes; then, the PEC set was removed. On the subsequent
      12 months follow-up, the patient resumed orthobiosis without any gastrointestinal
      discomfort and returned to work. This case emphasizes that FMT via PEC can not
      only induce remission but also shorten the duration of hospitalization and reduce
      the medical costs; therefore, this approach should be considered an alternative
      option for patients with UC.

TI  - Probiotics, fibre and herbal medicinal products for functional and inflammatory
      bowel disorders.
PG  - 1426-1449
LID - 10.1111/bph.13632 [doi]
AB  - Functional bowel disorders (FBD), mainly irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and
      functional constipation (FC, also called chronic idiopathic constipation), are
      very common worldwide. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative
      colitis and Crohn's disease, although less common, has a strong impact on
      patients' quality of life, as well as being highly expensive for our healthcare. 
      A definite cure for those disorders is still yet to come. Over the years, several
      therapeutic approaches complementary or alternative to traditional
      pharmacological treatments, including probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, fibre
      and herbal medicinal products, have been investigated for the management of both 
      groups of diseases. However, most available studies are biased by several
      drawbacks, including small samples and poor methodological quality. Probiotics,
      in particular Saccharomyces boulardii and Lactobacilli (among which Lactobacillus
      rhamnosus), synbiotics, psyllium, and some herbal medicinal products, primarily
      peppermint oil, seem to be effective in ameliorating IBS symptoms. Synbiotics and
      fibre seem to be beneficial in FC patients. The probiotic combination VSL#3 may
      be effective in inducing remission in patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative
      colitis, in whom Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 seems to be as effective as
      mesalamine in maintaining remission. No definite conclusions can be drawn as to
      the efficacy of fibre and herbal medicinal products in IBD patients due to the
      low number of studies and the lack of randomized controlled trials that replicate
      the results obtained in the individual studies conducted so far. Thus, further,
      well-designed studies are needed to address the real role of these therapeutic
      options in the management of both FBD and IBD. LINKED ARTICLES: This article is

TI  - Development and Application of a Plant-Based Diet Scoring System for Japanese
      Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
PG  - 16-019
LID - 10.7812/TPP/16-019 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Plant-based diets (PBDs) are a healthy alternative to westernized diets.
      A semivegetarian diet, a PBD, has been shown to prevent a relapse in Crohn
      disease. However, there is no way to measure adherence to PBDs. OBJECTIVE: To
      develop a simple way of evaluating adherence to a PBD for Japanese patients with 
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). DESIGN: PBD scores were assigned according to
      the frequency of consumption provided on a food-frequency questionnaire, obtained
      on hospitalization for 159 patients with ulcerative colitis and 70 patients with 
      Crohn disease. Eight items considered to be preventive factors for IBD were
      scored positively, and 8 items considered to be IBD risk factors were scored
      negatively. The PBD score was calculated from the sum of plus and minus scores.
      Higher PBD scores indicated greater adherence to a PBD. The PBD scores were
      evaluated on hospitalization and 2 years after discharge for 22 patients with
      Crohn disease whose dietary pattern and prognosis were established. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURE: Plant-Based Diet score. RESULTS: The PBD scores differed significantly, 
      in descending order, by dietary type: pro-Japanese diet, mixed type, and
      pro-westernized diet (Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis test). The PBD scores in the
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease groups were 10.9 +/- 9.5 and 8.2 +/- 8.2,
      respectively. For patients with Crohn disease, those with long-term remission and
      normal C-reactive protein concentration were significantly more likely to have
      PBD scores of 25 or greater than below 25 (chi(2)). CONCLUSION: The PBD score is 
      a valid assessment of PBD dietary adherence.

TI  - Patients Perceive Clinical Benefit with the Specific Carbohydrate Diet for
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
PG  - 3255-3260
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that dietary therapy may be effective for
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but limited published data exist 
      on the usage and efficacy of dietary therapy. AIM: To evaluate the perspective of
      IBD patients using the specific carbohydrate diet (SCD). METHODS: An anonymous
      online survey was conducted using REDCap, a Web-based survey tool. Survey links
      were sent to known Web sites as well as support groups in an attempt to
      characterize patient utilization of the SCD and perception of efficacy of the
      SCD. RESULTS: There were 417 respondents of the online survey on the SCD with
      IBD. Mean age for individuals on the SCD was 34.9 +/- 16.4 years. Seventy percent
      were female. Forty-seven percent had Crohn's disease, 43 % had ulcerative
      colitis, and 10 % had indeterminate colitis. Individuals perceived clinical
      improvement on the SCD. Four percent reported clinical remission prior to the
      SCD, while 33 % reported remission at 2 months after initiation of the SCD, and
      42 % at both 6 and 12 months. For those reporting clinical remission, 13 %
      reported time to achieve remission of less than 2 weeks, 17 % reported 2 weeks to
      a month, 36 % reported 1-3 months, and 34 % reported greater than 3 months. For
      individuals who reported reaching remission, 47 % of individuals reported
      associated improvement in abnormal laboratory values. CONCLUSIONS: The SCD is
      utilized by many patients as a primary and adjunct therapy for IBD. Most patients
      perceive clinical benefit to use of the SCD.

TI  - Therapeutic modulation of gut microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease: More
      questions to be answered.
PG  - 800-810
LID - 10.1111/1751-2980.12422 [doi]
AB  - Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) exhibit impaired control of the
      microbiome in the gut, and 'dysbiosis' is commonly observed. Western diet is a
      risk factor for the development of IBD, but it may have different effects on gut 
      microbiota between IBD and non-IBD individuals. Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN)
      can induce remission in pediatric Crohn's disease with a decrease in gut
      microbial diversity. Although there are some theoretical benefits, actual
      treatment effects of prebiotics and probiotics in IBD vary. High-quality studies 
      have shown that VSL#3 (a high-potency probiotic medical food containing eight
      different strains) exhibits benefits in treating ulcerative colitis, and gut
      microbial diversity is reduced after treated with VSL#3 in animal models. The
      effect of fecal microbiome transplantation on IBD is controversial. Increasing
      microbial diversity compared with impaired handling of bacteria presents a
      dilemma. Antibiotics are the strongest factors in the reduction of microbiome
      ecological diversity. Some antibiotics may help to induce remission of the
      disease. Microbiome alteration has been suggested to be an intrinsic property of 
      IBD and a potential predictor in diagnosis and prognosis. However, the effects of
      therapeutic modulations are variable; thus, more questions remain to be answered.

TI  - ALLERGIC PROCTOCOLITIS IN INFANTS: analysis of the evolution of the nutritional
      status.

AB  - Background: Allergic proctocolitis is a disease that affects infants in the first
      months. The change in feed is the primary factor for clinical improvement and
      maintenance of the nutritional status of the infant. Objective: Study the
      anthropometric evolution of infants with allergic proctocolitis at diagnosis and 
      1 to 6 months after nutritional intervention. Methods: A retrospective cohort of 
      infants with allergic proctocolitis diagnosis followed at the Pediatric
      Gastroenterology Institute of Sao Paulo (IGASTROPED), Brazil. The database with
      clinical, therapeutic and anthropometric data was obtained from medical records
      of outpatient infants. The therapeutic intervention was characterized by 1)
      exclusive breastfeeding with maternal exclusion diet of the six allergens
      (EBF-MED) or 2) no breastfeeding and use of hypoallergenic formulas. Results: Of 
      the 44 infants diagnosed with allergic proctocolitis, 23 were female. The median 
      age of the infants was 3.5 months at the time of admission and 6 months after the
      intervention. The main clinical complaint was hematochezia with or without other 
      symptoms of allergic proctocolitis. No difference was shown in the infants
      anthropometric evaluation between the two diets. Conclusion: The duration of the 
      allergic proctocolitis did not induce worsening of the infants nutritional
      status. Importantly, both nutritional interventions were able to keep the infants
      within the growth channel and resulted in the total clinical symptoms remission. 
      Considering the fundamental mother-child link promoted by breastfeeding, the

TI  - Lycopene, Lutein and Zeaxanthin May Reduce Faecal Blood, Mucus and Pus but not
      Abdominal Pain in Individuals with Ulcerative Colitis.
LID - E613 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The main symptom of ulcerative colitis is diarrhoea, which is often
      accompanied by painful tenesmus and faecal blood and mucus. It sometimes
      co-occurs with abdominal pain, fever, feeling of fatigue, loss of appetite and
      weight loss. Some dietary factors have been indicated as important in the
      treatment of ulcerative colitis. The aim of the study was to analyse the
      association between retinoid intake (total vitamin A, retinol, beta-carotene,
      alpha-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, lutein and zeaxanthin) and
      ulcerative colitis symptoms (abdominal pain, faecal blood, faecal mucus, faecal
      pus) in individuals with ulcerative colitis in remission. METHODS: Assessment of 
      diet was based on self-reported data from each patient's dietary records taken
      over a period of three typical, random days (2 weekdays and 1 day of the
      weekend). RESULTS: A total of 56 individuals with ulcerative colitis in remission
      (19 males and 37 females) were recruited for the study. One in every four
      individuals with ulcerative colitis in remission was characterised as having
      inadequate vitamin A intake. Higher lycopene, lutein and zeaxanthin intakes in
      individuals with ulcerative colitis in remission were associated with lower
      faecal blood, mucus and pus but not with lower incidence of abdominal pain.
      Higher carotene intake in individuals with ulcerative colitis in remission may
      contribute to higher incidence of faecal mucus. CONCLUSIONS: Optimising intake of
      specific retinoids may enhance disease control in individuals with ulcerative
      colitis. Prospective studies, including patient reported and objective outcomes, 
      are required to confirm this.

TI  - The human gastrointestinal tract and oral microbiota in inflammatory bowel
      disease: a state of the science review.
PG  - 3-10
LID - 10.1111/apm.12609 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) includes a spectrum of diseases from ulcerative 
      colitis (UC) to Crohn's disease (CD). Many studies have addressed the changes in 
      the microbiota of individuals affected by UC and CD. A decrease in biodiversity
      and depletion of the phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes has been reported, among 
      others. Changes in microbial composition also result in changes in the
      metabolites generated in the gut from microbial activity that may involve the
      amount of butyrate and other metabolites such as H2 S being produced. Other
      factors such as diet, age, or medication need to be taken into consideration when
      studying dysbiosis associated with IBD. Diverse bacterial species have been
      associated specifically or non-specifically to IBD, but none of them have been
      demonstrated to be its ethiological agent. Recent studies also suggest that
      micro-eukaryotic populations may also be altered in IBD patients. Last, but not
      least, viruses, and specially bacteriophages, can play a role in controlling
      microbial populations in the gastrointestinal tract. This may affect both
      bacterial diversity and metabolism, but possible implications for IBD still
      remain to be solved. Dysbiosis in the oral microbiome associated with IBD remains
      an emerging field for future research.

TI  - Fucosylation Deficiency in Mice Leads to Colitis and Adenocarcinoma.
PG  - 193-205.e10
LID - S0016-5085(16)35029-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2016.09.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: De novo synthesis of guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-fucose, a
      substrate for fucosylglycans, requires sequential reactions mediated by
      GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase (GMDS) and GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose
      3,5-epimerase-4-reductase (FX or tissue specific transplantation antigen P35B
      [TSTA3]). GMDS deletions and mutations are found in 6%-13% of colorectal cancers;
      these mostly affect the ascending and transverse colon. We investigated whether a
      lack of fucosylation consequent to loss of GDP-fucose synthesis contributes to
      colon carcinogenesis. METHODS: FX deficiency and GMDS deletion produce the same
      biochemical phenotype of GDP-fucose deficiency. We studied a mouse model of
      fucosylation deficiency (Fx-/- mice) and mice with the full-length Fx gene
      (controls). Mice were placed on standard chow or fucose-containing diet
      (equivalent to a control fucosylglycan phenotype). Colon tissues were collected
      and analyzed histologically or by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to measure
      cytokine levels; T cells also were collected and analyzed. Fecal samples were
      analyzed by 16s ribosomal RNA sequencing. Mucosal barrier function was measured
      by uptake of fluorescent dextran. We transplanted bone marrow cells from Fx-/- or
      control mice (Ly5.2) into irradiated 8-week-old Fx-/- or control mice (Ly5.1). We
      performed immunohistochemical analyses for expression of Notch and the hes family
      bHLH transcription factor (HES1) in colon tissues from mice and a panel of 60
      human colorectal cancer specimens (27 left-sided, 33 right-sided). RESULTS: Fx-/-
      mice developed colitis and serrated-like lesions. The intestinal pathology of
      Fx-/- mice was reversed by addition of fucose to the diet, which restored
      fucosylation via a salvage pathway. In the absence of fucosylation, dysplasia
      appeared and progressed to adenocarcinoma in up to 40% of mice, affecting mainly 
      the right colon and cecum. Notch was not activated in Fx-/- mice fed standard
      chow, leading to decreased expression of its target Hes1. Fucosylation deficiency
      altered the composition of the fecal microbiota, reduced mucosal barrier
      function, and altered epithelial proliferation marked by Ki67. Fx-/- mice
      receiving control bone marrow cells had intestinal inflammation and dysplasia,
      and reduced expression of cytokines produced by cytotoxic T cells. Human sessile 
      serrated adenomas and right-sided colorectal tumors with epigenetic loss of MutL 
      homolog 1 (MLH1) had lost or had lower levels of HES1 than other colorectal tumor
      types or nontumor tissues. CONCLUSIONS: In mice, fucosylation deficiency leads to
      colitis and adenocarcinoma, loss of Notch activation, and down-regulation of
      Hes1. HES1 loss correlates with the development of human right-sided colorectal
      tumors with epigenetic loss of MLH1. These findings indicate that carcinogenesis 
      in a subset of colon cancer is consequent to a molecular mechanism driven by
      fucosylation deficiency and/or HES1-loss.

LID - 10.1177/0009922816664512 [doi]
AB  - Cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) is a common condition encountered in children
      with incidence estimated as 2% to 7.5% in the first year of life. Formula and
      breast-fed babies can present with symptoms of CMPA. It is important to
      accurately diagnose CMPA to avoid the consequences of either under- or
      overdiagnosis. CMPA is classically categorized into immunoglobulin E (IgE)- or
      non-IgE-mediated reaction that vary in clinical manifestations, diagnostic
      evaluation, and prognosis. The most commonly involved systems in patients with
      CMPA are gastrointestinal, skin, and respiratory. Evaluation of CMPA starts with 
      good data gathering followed by testing if indicated. Treatment is simply by
      avoidance of cow's milk protein (CMP) in the child's or mother's diet, if
      exclusively breast-feeding. This article reviews the definition, epidemiology,
      risk factors, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, evaluation, management, and
      prognosis of CMPA and provides an overview of different options for formulas and 
      their indication in the treatment of CMPA.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic pathology that has an outbreaks
      course that in recent years have seen an increase in incidence, especially at
      younger ages. Malnutrition is frequently associated with this condition,
      therefore, it is very important to ensure a right nutritional intervention,
      especially in pediatric patients, to ensure an optimal growth and also an
      improvement in the clinic. Our goal will be updated the role of nutrition in this
      disease and in its treatment based on the published evidence. Malnutrition in
      these patients is frequent and is influenced by various factors such as,
      decreased food intake, increased nutrient requirements, increased protein loss
      and malabsorption of nutrients. Therefore there should be a nutritional
      monitoring of all of them, in which anthropometric measurements, laboratory tests
      and densitometry were made to establish the needs and sufficient caloric intake
      tailored to each patient. The use of enteral nutrition as a treatment in Crohn's 
      disease with mild to moderate outbreak in child population, is amply
      demonstrated, has even shown to be superior to the use of corticosteroids.
      Therefore we can conclude by stressing that nutritional intervention is a
      mainstay in the management of patients with IBD, which aims to prevent and / or
      control disease-related malnutrition to decrease morbidity and mortality and
      improve quality of life.

TI  - Presumed Allergic Proctocolitis Resolves with Probiotic Monotherapy: A Report of 
      4 Cases.
PG  - 621-4
AB  - BACKGROUND The prevalence of allergic diseases has been dramatically rising in
      the United States and other developed nations over recent decades. Growing
      evidence suggests a partial role for the microbiome in the development of these
      allergic diseases. Food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis (AP) (also
      referred to as cow's milk protein intolerance or allergy) is among the earliest
      and most common food allergic diseases of infancy, yet its pathophysiology is not
      well understood. The currently accepted clinical practice is to restrict the diet
      until 12 months of age. CASE REPORT We present 4 cases of clinically diagnosed AP
      whose symptoms quickly and completely resolved with probiotic Lactobacillus
      rhamnosus GG (LGG) monotherapy. All 4 infants avoided any dietary restrictions.
      The range of time from probiotic initiation to symptom resolution was 7-28 days. 
      CONCLUSIONS These cases suggest an important role for the infant intestinal
      microbiome in the development of gastrointestinal mucosal food allergies such as 
      AP. Prospective investigation of the intestinal microbiome in infants with AP may
      further our understanding of this disease's pathogenesis. The potential use of
      probiotic monotherapy in the treatment of AP also warrants further investigation.

      phase.

LID - 10.1152/ajpgi.00433.2015 [doi]
AB  - The impact of the dietary protein level on the process of colonic mucosal
      inflammation and subsequent recovery remains largely unknown. In this study, we
      fed DSS-treated mice with either a normoproteic (NP) or a high-protein (HP)
      isocaloric diet from the beginning of the 5-day dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)
      treatment to 14 days later. Measurements of colitis indicators (colon
      weight:length ratio, myeloperoxidase activity, cytokine expressions) showed a
      similar level of colonic inflammation in both DSS groups during the colitis
      induction phase. However, during the colitis resolution phase, inflammation
      intensity was higher in the DSS-HP group than in the DSS-NP group as evidenced by
      higher inflammatory score and body weight loss. This coincided with a higher
      mortality rate. In surviving animals, an increase in colonic crypt height
      associated with a higher number of colon epithelial cells per crypt, and
      TGF-beta3 content was observed in the DSS-HP vs. DSS-NP group. Moreover, colonic 
      expression patterns of tight junction proteins and E-cadherin were also different
      according to the diet. Altogether, our results indicate that the HP diet, when
      given during both the induction and resolution periods of DSS-induced colitis,
      showed deleterious effects during the post-induction phase. However, HP diet
      ingestion was also associated with morphological and biochemical differences
      compatible with higher colonic epithelium restoration in surviving animals,
      indicating an effect of the dietary protein level on colonic crypt repair after
      acute inflammation. These data highlight the potential impact of the dietary
      protein amount during the colitis course.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has become a 'prototype disease' for chronic
      auto-inflammatory disorders with a polygenic background and important
      multifaceted environmental trigger components. The environmental factors
      contribute both to pathogenesis and disease flares. Thus, IBD is a disease par
      excellence to study the interactions between host genetics, environmental factors
      (such as infections or smoking) and 'in-vironmental' factors - for example, our
      intestinal microbiota. Longitudinal intercurrent events, including the impact of 
      long-term medication on disease progression or stabilization, can exemplarily be 
      studied in this disease group. Whilst alterations in the human genome coding
      relevant variant protein products have most likely not emerged significantly over
      the last 50 years, the incidence of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis has
      dramatically increased in Western countries and more recently in the Asia Pacific
      area. An interesting concept indicates that 'Western lifestyle factors' trigger
      chronic intestinal inflammation or disease flares in a genetically susceptible
      host. To understand the disease pathogenesis as well as triggers for flares or
      determinants of disease courses, we must further investigate potential
      en(in)vironmental factors. As environmental conditions, in contrast to genetic
      risk factors, can be influenced, knowledge on those risk factors becomes crucial 
      to modulate disease incidence, disease course or clinical presentation. It is
      obvious that prevention of environmentally triggered disease flares would be a
      goal most relevant for IBD patients. An increased prevalence of IBD in urban
      environment has been documented in Switzerland by the Swiss IBD cohort study.
      Several studies have attempted to identify such factors; however, only a few have
      been validated. The best investigated environmental factor identified in IBD
      cohort analyses is smoking. Other environmental factors that have been associated
      with clinical presentation or risk of inflammatory flares as well as increased
      incidence are diet and food additives. The so-called 'hygiene hypothesis'
      suggests that increased hygiene in childhood associated with reduced exposure to 
      pathogens may leave the mucosal immune system insufficiently trained and thus
      prone to uncontrolled inflammation. Oral contraceptives and non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs are the 2 main classes of frequently taken drugs that
      have been attributed to have the potential to cause flares of the disease. What
      is likely to be the connection between the genetic susceptibility and the
      environmental triggers? There is broad evidence for a critical role of the
      commensal enteric microbiota as a modulator of immunologic responses relevant
      during onset and chronification of IBD.

AB  - Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders represent a spectrum of disorders
      demonstrating gastrointestinal eosinophilia without any known cause for
      eosinophilia. Pathogenesis is not clearly established, but immune responses to
      dietary antigens are implicated. These disorders affect children and adults and
      are seen in association with allergic disorders. Eosinophilic esophagitis is
      diagnosed in the setting of mucosal eosinophilia on endoscopic biopsy and
      symptoms of esophageal dysfunction. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is also
      diagnosed with endoscopic biopsies. Eosinophilic colitis commonly presents with
      lower gastrointestinal symptoms and is a diagnosis of exclusion.

PG  - 6-12
LID - 10.1080/08941939.2016.1215574 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Orally administered iron can induce colonic inflammation in healthy
      animals and aggravate experimental colitis. AIM: To investigate the influence of 
      the biologic agents infliximab and adalimumab on the severity of TNBS colitis
      following orally supplemented iron. MATERIALS-METHODS: 204 Wistar rats were
      allocated into 14 groups. Colitis was induced by TNBS. Iron was administered via 
      a mouth catheter at a dose of 0.027, 0.3, and 3%/kg diet per day, respectively.
      Infliximab was subcutaneously administered on the 2(nd) and 6(th) day in a dose
      of 5 mg/kgBW, while adalimumab was administered on the 2(nd) day in a dose of 2
      mg/kgBW. On the 8(th) day, all animals were euthanatized. Activity of colitis and
      extent of tissue damage were assessed histologically. Tissue Tumor Necrosis
      Factor-alpha (t-TNF-alpha) and malondialdehyde (t-MDA) were estimated. RESULTS:
      In normal rats both agents significantly worsen the degree of inflammation
      induced by moderate or high iron supplementation despite the disappearance of
      t-TNF-alpha, and reduction of t-MDA. In the groups of TNBS colitis and moderate
      or high iron administration, both agents again significantly worsen the degree of
      inflammation despite the significant reduction in the t-TNF-alpha and t-MDA.
      CONCLUSION: Adalimumab and infliximab do not ameliorate the inflammation in
      TNBS-induced colitis aggravated by orally administered iron. These findings might
      be clinically relevant in patients with active IBD under concurrent treatment
      with biologic agents and per oral iron.

TI  - What Are the Top 10 Research Questions in the Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel
      Disease? A Priority Setting Partnership with the James Lind Alliance.
PG  - 204-211
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjw144 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Many uncertainties remain regarding optimal therapies and
      strategies for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. Setting research
      priorities addressing therapies requires a partnership between health care
      professionals, patients and organisations supporting patients. We aimed to use
      the structure of the James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership, which has 
      been used in other disease areas, to identify and prioritise unanswered questions
      about treatments for inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: The James Lind Priority
      Setting Partnership uses methods agreed and adopted in other disease areas to
      work with patients and clinicians: to identify uncertainties about treatments; to
      agree by consensus a prioritised list of uncertainties for research; then to
      translate these uncertainties into research questions which are amenable to
      hypothesis testing; and finally to take results to research commissioning bodies 
      to be considered for funding. RESULTS: A total of 1636 uncertainties were
      collected in the initial survey from 531 respondents, which included 22% health
      care professionals and 78% patients and carers. Using the rigorously applied
      processes of the priority setting partnership, this list was distilled down to
      the top 10 research priorities for inflammatory bowel disease. The top priorities
      were: identifying treatment strategies to optimise efficacy, safety and
      cost-effectiveness; and stratifying patients with regard to their disease course 
      and treatment response. Diet and symptom control [pain, incontinence and fatigue]
      were also topics which were prioritised. CONCLUSIONS: A partnership involving
      multidisciplinary clinicians, patients and organisations supporting patients has 
      identified the top 10 research priorities in the treatment of patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease.

AB  - GOALS: To determine factors contributing to satisfaction with treatment in
      mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis (UC) from both the patients and the
      physicians perspectives. BACKGROUND: Despite the impact of UC on different
      aspects of daily life, patient's and physician's satisfaction with clinical
      management has been poorly evaluated. STUDY: A Delphi study involving 22 patients
      and 20 clinicians was conducted. The patient's questionnaire included 285 items
      regarding diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up, whereas the physician's
      questionnaire added 32 specific items for clinicians. Relevance of items was
      scored from 1 (not at all important) to 9 (very important). Recommendations were 
      based on very highly rated items. RESULTS: Most items were rated consistently by 
      patients and physicians with some exceptions. Patients emphasized the choice of
      moderate flare-ups to be followed at the hospital setting rather than in primary 
      care as well as to be informed on aspects, such as diet and impact of UC on their
      health and lifestyle. Treatment-related efficacy, safety, and improved quality of
      life were relevant for both patients and physicians. Physicians believed that to 
      reduce pill burden was a crucial aspect to improve patient's satisfaction.
      Patients preferred oral administration treatment over rectal treatment.
      CONCLUSIONS: The study identified specific aspects related to the management of
      mild-to-moderate UC that both patients and physicians considered to be highly
      relevant for patient satisfaction. Recommendation based on these factors would be
      important at the time of designing and implementing strategies targeting
      satisfaction in UC patients.

TI  - Food intolerance prevalence in active ulcerative colitis in southwest China.
PG  - 529-33
LID - 10.6133/apjcn.102015.04 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Food intolerance is believed to be a source of
      frequent medical problems in ulcerative colitis (UC), which closely correlate
      with patients' dietary pattern. Living in an underdeveloped area of China,
      residents in southwestern region have diverse dietary habits. The objective of
      this study is to determine the prevalence of food intolerance in the UC patients 
      in this area and to discuss some of the possible risk factors leading to the
      condition. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Food antibodies in serum of 80 patients with
      active UC were determined by standard enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA).
      This study examined the risk factors contributing to high titers of food
      antibodies and the dietary patterns correlating with food intolerance in these
      demographics. RESULTS: 83.8% of patients (67/80) were found to be seropositive
      for food intolerance. Patients of female, aged between 20 to 40 and the one who
      tended to have a high fat diet were tested to be highly seropositive (p<0.05).
      Neither spicy food intake nor the course the disease manifested any relationship 
      with the presence of food intolerance (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Active UC patients in
      southwestern region of China have showed to be high seropositive in food
      intolerance, particularly in female and young patients. Dietary patterns with
      high in fat intake seem to have caused high prevalence of seropositivity in food 
      intolerance. Although rice has been taken as staple food and the spicy food has
      been popular among citizen in this region, these foods have indicated to no
      effect on food intolerance in this study.

TI  - Patients with inflammatory bowel disease and their treating clinicians have
      different views regarding diet.
PG  - 66-72
LID - 10.1111/jhn.12400 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diet and body composition play unclear roles in the pathogenesis,
      activity and symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Evidence-based
      guidance regarding dietary modification in IBD is lacking. We aimed to determine 
      the attitudes of IBD patients and clinicians to diet. METHODS: The present
      cross-sectional study comprised an online questionnaire distributed to members of
      a national IBD patient organisation, assessing demographics, anthropometry,
      disease phenotype and dietary beliefs. Dietitians, gastroenterologists and
      surgeons were targeted for a similar questionnaire as a result of membership of
      national professional bodies. RESULTS: Nine hundred and twenty-eight patients
      (72.2% female; mean age 39.5 years; age range 5-91 years) responded. Two-thirds
      of the patients had Crohn's disease. The mean reported body mass index was 24.9
      kg m(-2) and was significantly skewed to the right. Patients who had taken >10
      courses of steroids were had a greater probability of being overweight or obese, 
      independent of disease complications. Most patients (71%) assumed that their diet
      affected their IBD; 61% considered their IBD specialist disregarded the
      importance of diet. Of the 136 clinicians who responded, the majority felt that
      diet was a factor in symptoms and intestinal microbiota. More gastroenterologists
      (44%) than dietitians (17%) considered that diet had a role in the pathogenesis
      of IBD (P = 0.003). Twenty-six percent of patients reported receiving dietary
      advice from their IBD specialist, whereas 98% of gastroenterologists reported
      advice provision. Patients received diverse advice. Half of the patients followed
      recommendations provided by a clinician. CONCLUSIONS: The present study
      demonstrates that IBD patients consider diet to be important in their disease.
      IBD clinicians from different disciplines have diverse views of the role of diet.
      Advice given to patients is heterogeneous, often perceived as inadequate and
      poorly followed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence and factors associated with transaminasemia in celiac 
      disease are poorly known. AIMS: To investigate these issues in paediatric celiac 
      patients and controls. METHODS: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was studied in 150
      children with untreated celiac disease, 161 disease controls and 500
      population-based controls. The association between ALT and clinical and
      histological variables and the effect of a gluten-free diet were investigated in 
      celiac patients. RESULTS: ALT was >30U/l: celiac disease 14.7%, ulcerative
      colitis 37.2%, Crohn's disease 16.7%, reflux disease 16.2%, functional
      gastrointestinal symptoms 8.9%, and controls 3.6%. Factors associated with
      increased ALT were poor growth (45.5% vs 24.2%, P=0.039) and severe villous
      atrophy (median 23.0U/l vs partial atrophy 19.0U/l, P=0.008), but not age, sex,
      body-mass index, type or severity of symptoms and co-morbidities. ALT had a
      moderate correlation with endomysial (r=0.334, P<0.001) and transglutaminase
      antibodies (r=0.264, P=0.002) and ferritin (r=-0.225, P=0.03), but not with other
      laboratory values. On gluten-free diet median ALT decreased from 22.0U/l to
      18.0U/l (P=0.002) and 80% of the high values normalized. CONCLUSION: Increased
      ALT is associated with more advanced serological and histological celiac disease.
      Adherence to a gluten-free diet appears to result in normalization or reduction
      of ALT levels.

TI  - Potential Benefits of Dietary Fibre Intervention in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
LID - 10.3390/ijms17060919 [doi]
LID - E919 [pii]
AB  - Intestinal dysbiosis is thought to be an important cause of disease progression
      and the gastrointestinal symptoms experienced in patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). Inflammation appears to be a major contributor in perpetuating a
      dysregulated gut microbiota. Although current drug therapies can significantly
      induce and maintain disease remission, there is no cure for these diseases.
      Nevertheless, ongoing human studies investigating dietary fibre interventions may
      potentially prove to exert beneficial outcomes for IBD. Postulated mechanisms
      include direct interactions with the gut mucosa through immunomodulation, or
      indirectly through the microbiome. Component species of the microbiome may
      degrade dietary-fibre polysaccharides and ferment the products to form
      short-chain fatty acids such as butyrate. Prebiotic dietary fibres may also act
      more directly by altering the composition of the microbiome. Longer term benefits
      in reducing the risk of more aggressive disease or colorectal cancer may require 
      other dietary fibre sources such as wheat bran or psyllium. By critically
      examining clinical trials that have used dietary fibre supplements or dietary
      patterns containing specific types or amounts of dietary fibres, it may be
      possible to assess whether varying the intake of specific dietary fibres may
      offer an efficient treatment for IBD patients.

LID - 10.1007/s00204-016-1747-2 [doi]
AB  - Chronic inflammation is strongly associated with approximately one-fifth of all
      human cancers. Arising from combinations of factors such as environmental
      exposures, diet, inherited gene polymorphisms, infections, or from dysfunctions
      of the immune response, chronic inflammation begins as an attempt of the body to 
      remove injurious stimuli; however, over time, this results in continuous tissue
      destruction and promotion and maintenance of carcinogenesis. Here, we focus on
      intestinal inflammation and its associated cancers, a group of diseases on the
      rise and affecting millions of people worldwide. Intestinal inflammation can be
      widely grouped into inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
      disease) and celiac disease. Long-standing intestinal inflammation is associated 
      with colorectal cancer and small-bowel adenocarcinoma, as well as extraintestinal
      manifestations, including lymphomas and autoimmune diseases. This article
      highlights potential mechanisms of pathogenesis in inflammatory bowel diseases
      and celiac disease, as well as those involved in the progression to associated
      cancers, most of which have been identified from studies utilizing mouse models
      of intestinal inflammation. Mouse models of intestinal inflammation can be widely
      grouped into chemically induced models; genetic models, which make up the bulk of
      the studied models; adoptive transfer models; and spontaneous models. Studies in 
      these models have lead to the understanding that persistent antigen exposure in
      the intestinal lumen, in combination with loss of epithelial barrier function,
      and dysfunction and dysregulation of the innate and adaptive immune responses
      lead to chronic intestinal inflammation. Transcriptional changes in this
      environment leading to cell survival, hyperplasia, promotion of angiogenesis,
      persistent DNA damage, or insufficient repair of DNA damage due to an excess of
      proinflammatory mediators are then thought to lead to sustained malignant
      transformation. With regard to extraintestinal manifestations such as lymphoma,
      however, more suitable models are required to further investigate the complex and
      heterogeneous mechanisms that may be at play.

TI  - Report: impact of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - s32-8
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's
      disease (CD), 2 conditions characterized by chronic inflammation. Approximately
      1.17 million people in the United States are affected by these 2 conditions. It
      is theorized that a genetic susceptibility coupled with environmental factors,
      such as smoking, antibiotics, oral contraceptives, appendectomy, or diet, may
      influence the development of IBD. Patients with UC and CD may exhibit similar
      symptoms, and the conditions are often misclassified, as there is a lack of
      standard criteria for diagnosing IBD. Therefore, it is important for clinicians
      to rule out any diarrhea-related conditions for an accurate diagnosis. UC and CD 
      typically manifest in early adulthood, and the chronic nature of these conditions
      greatly impacts a patient's perception, body image, and quality of life. The
      inability to participate in social activities due to UC and CD impacts not only
      patients, but also those with whom they have close relationships.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis; Crohn's disease) are
      debilitating relapsing inflammatory disorders affecting the gastrointestinal
      tract, with deleterious effect on quality of life, and increasing incidence and
      prevalence. Mucosal inflammation, due to altered microbiota, increased intestinal
      permeability and immune system dysfunction underlies the symptoms and may be
      caused in susceptible individuals by different factors (or a combination of
      them), including dietary habits and components. In this review we describe the
      influence of the Western diet, obesity, and different nutraceuticals/functional
      foods (bioactive peptides, phytochemicals, omega 3-polyunsaturated fatty acids,
      vitamin D, probiotics and prebiotics) on the course of IBD, and provide some
      hints that could be useful for nutritional guidance. Hopefully, research will
      soon offer enough reliable data to slow down the spread of the disease and to
      make diet a cornerstone in IBD therapy.

AB  - The inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consisting of Crohn's disease (CD) and
      ulcerative colitis (UC) are defined as idiopathic, chronic and relapsing
      intestinal disorders occurring in genetically predisposed individuals exposed to 
      environmental risk factors such as diet and microbiome changes. Since
      conventional drug therapy is expensive and not fully efficient, there is a need
      for alternative remedies that can improve the outcome in patients suffering from 
      IBD. Whether exercise, which has been proposed as adjunct therapy in IBD, can be 
      beneficial in patients with IBD remains an intriguing question. In this review,
      we provide an overview of the effects of exercise on human IBD and experimental
      colitis in animal models that mimic human disease, although the information on
      exercise in human IBD are sparse and poorly understood. Moderate exercise can
      exert a beneficial ameliorating effect on IBD and improve the healing of
      experimental animal colitis due to the activity of protective myokines such as
      irisin released from working skeletal muscles. CD patients with higher levels of 
      exercise were significantly less likely to develop active disease at six months. 
      Moreover, voluntary exercise has been shown to exert a positive effect on IBD
      patients' mood, weight maintenance and osteoporosis. On the other hand, depending
      on its intensity and duration, exercise can evoke transient mild systemic
      inflammation and enhances pro-inflammatory cytokine release, thereby exacerbating
      the gastrointestinal symptoms. We discuss recent advances in the mechanism of
      voluntary and strenuous exercise affecting the outcome of IBD in patients and
      experimental animal models.

TI  - Eosinophilic Gastroenteritis: An Underdiagnosed Condition.
PG  - 2585-92
LID - 10.1007/s10620-016-4203-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EOGE) is a rare idiopathic disease
      characterized by eosinophil-predominant inflammation of the stomach and/or
      intestines. Our aims are to determine the epidemiology, clinical features and
      outcomes of EOGE cases in a tertiary-care hospital. METHODS: Retrospective cohort
      study of patients with gastrointestinal eosinophilic infiltration from 2004
      through 2014. All relevant specimens were reviewed by an expert pathologist.
      Significant eosinophilic infiltrate was defined as >25 eosinophils/HPF in the
      stomach or small intestine and >50 eosinophils/HPF in the colon. RESULTS: Three
      hundred and sixty-one charts were reviewed and 13 EOGE cases were identified,
      including nine adults and four pediatric cases. The majority (78 %) of adult
      cases were females. Clinical presentation was variable; most patients (62 %) had 
      abdominal pain, followed by diarrhea (31 %) and nausea/vomiting (31 %). Atopy and
      food allergies were present in 54 and 38 % of patients, respectively. Weight loss
      and failure to thrive were present only in pediatric cases (50 vs 0 %; P = .01). 
      Most EOGE cases (69 %) had peripheral eosinophilia, which was more prominent in
      patients with ascites compared to patients without ascites (37.3 +/- 25.4 vs 9.3 
      +/- 5.4 %; P = .01). Among patients who had long-term follow-up; 30 % had
      spontaneous remission, 60 % responded to steroids and/or restriction diet, and 10
      % had refractory disease. CONCLUSION: EOGE is an underdiagnosed condition. In
      contrast to eosinophilic esophagitis; the disease might be female-predominant in 
      adults. High index of clinical suspicion is required for diagnosis. Further
      studies about the long-term outcomes and the efficacy of restriction diet in
      adult patients are required.

TI  - Fasting for haemostasis in children with gastrointestinal bleeding.
PG  - CD010714
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD010714.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal bleeding refers to loss of blood from any site of
      the digestive tract. In paediatric clinical practice, it is usually a complaint
      of children attending the emergency department as a symptom of diseases such as
      ulcers, gastric or oesophageal varices, gastritis, Mallory-Weiss tears, anorectal
      fissures, allergic colitis, infectious colitis, intussusception, Henoch-Schonlein
      purpura, and Meckel's diverticulum; it also occurs with high incidence in
      critically ill children hospitalised in intensive care units and is caused by
      stress-induced gastropathy. No matter what the cause of gastrointestinal
      bleeding, fasting is believed to be necessary due to the fear that eating may
      affect haemostasis or aggravate bleeding. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects and
      safety of fasting for haemostasis in gastrointestinal bleeding in children.
      SEARCH METHODS: We searched EBM Reviews - the Cochrane Central Register of
      Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (May 2016), Ovid MEDLINE(R) (1946 to 3 May 2016),
      EMBASE (1980 to 2016 Week 18), Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM) (1978 to 3 May
      2016), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) (1979 to 3 May 2016), VIP
      Database (1989 to 4 May 2016) and Wanfang Data (1990 to 4 May 2016). We used no
      restrictions on language or study setting and limited searches in CNKI and
      Wanfang Data to the medical field. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled
      trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs in children with gastrointestinal bleeding that
      compared fasting with feeding. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors
      independently screened the literature search results, and there were no
      disagreements. MAIN RESULTS: We identified no RCTs or quasi-RCTs that compared
      the effects and safety of fasting with feeding for haemostasis in children with
      gastrointestinal bleeding. No study fulfilled the criteria for considering
      studies for our review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is currently no information
      available from RCTs or quasi-RCTs to support or refute the use of fasting for
      haemostasis in children with gastrointestinal bleeding.

TI  - delta- and gamma-tocopherols inhibit phIP/DSS-induced colon carcinogenesis by
      protection against early cellular and DNA damages.
PG  - 172-183
LID - 10.1002/mc.22481 [doi]
AB  - Tocopherols, the major forms of vitamin E, are a family of fat-soluble compounds 
      that exist in alpha (alpha-T), beta (beta-T), gamma (gamma-T), and delta
      (delta-T) variants. A cancer preventive effect of vitamin E is suggested by
      epidemiological studies. However, past animal studies and human intervention
      trials with alpha-T, the most active vitamin E form, have yielded disappointing
      results. A possible explanation is that the cancer preventive activity of alpha-T
      is weak compared to other tocopherol forms. In the present study, we investigated
      the effects of delta-T, gamma-T, and alpha-T (0.2% in diet) in a novel colon
      cancer model induced by the meat-derived dietary carcinogen,
      2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and promoted by dextran
      sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in CYP1A-humanized (hCYP1A) mice. PhIP/DSS
      treatments induced multiple polypoid tumors, mainly tubular adenocarcinomas, in
      the middle to distal colon of the hCYP1A mice after 10 wk. Dietary
      supplementation with delta-T and gamma-T significantly reduced colon tumor
      formation and suppressed markers of oxidative and nitrosative stress (i.e.,
      8-oxo-dG and nitrotyrosine) as well as pro-inflammatory mediators (i.e.,
      NF-kappaB p65 and p-STAT3) in tumors and adjacent tissues. By administering
      delta-T at different time periods, we obtained results suggesting that the
      inhibitory effect of delta-T against colon carcinogenesis is mainly due to
      protection against early cellular and DNA damages caused by PhIP. alpha-T was
      found to be ineffective in inhibiting colon tumors and less effective in
      attenuating the molecular changes. Altogether, we demonstrated strong cancer
      preventive effects of delta-T and gamma-T in a physiologically relevant model of 
      human colon cancer. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Chemopreventive Effect of Dietary Glutamineon Colitis-Associated Colorectal
      Cancer Is Associated with Modulation of the DEPTOR/mTOR Signaling Pathway.
LID - 10.3390/nu8050261 [doi]
LID - E261 [pii]
AB  - Glutamine plays a protective role in colitis and colitis-associated colorectal
      cancer (CAC); however, the protective mechanisms are largely unknown to date. DEP
      domain-containing mTOR-interacting protein (DEPTOR)/mammalian Target of Rapamycin
      (mTOR) signaling plays an important role in carcinogenesis. The present study
      investigated the potential molecular mechanisms for the protective effect of
      glutamine in a murine model of azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium
      (DSS)-induced CAC. The effects of glutamine on DEPTOR/mTOR signaling and protein 
      light chain 3 (LC3) were evaluated. Administration of glutamine was associated
      with attenuated development of CAC. Increased expression of DEPTOR and decreased 
      expressions of factors of mTOR signaling, including phospho-mTOR, phospho-STAT3, 
      phospho-Akt, and phospho-S6, were observed in AOM/DSS mice administered
      glutamine. Furthermore, oral glutamine was associated with increased LC3-II
      expression in AOM/DSS mice. The present study indicates that regulation of
      DEPTOR/mTOR signaling may be an important mechanism for glutamine in prevention
      against the development of CAC. In addition, the chemopreventive effect of
      dietary glutamine on CAC is, at least in part, associated with the induction of
      autophagy.

TI  - Diallyl Disulfide (DADS), a Constituent of Garlic, Inactivates NF-kappaB and
      Prevents Colitis-Induced Colorectal Cancer by Inhibiting GSK-3beta.
PG  - 607-15
LID - 10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-16-0044 [doi]
AB  - There is a strong belief that garlic has medicinal properties and may even reduce
      the risk of developing certain cancers including those of the gastrointestinal
      tract. The chemopreventive effects of garlic may be attributed to the
      anti-inflammatory properties of the sulfur-containing constituents of garlic,
      which includes diallyl disulfide (DADS). Here, we demonstrate that DADS prevented
      colorectal tumorigenesis in a mouse model of colitis-induced colorectal cancer.
      Supplementation with 85 ppm of DADS (60 mg daily human equivalent dose) in the
      diet of FVB/N mice treated with chemical carcinogen azoxymethane (AOM) and
      colonic irritant dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) resulted in the reduction in tumor 
      incidence, tumor number, and tumor burden by 21.54%, 47.3%, and 66.4%,
      respectively. Further analysis revealed that mice fed the DADS-supplemented diet 
      resolved the initial DSS-induced inflammation faster than those on the control
      diet, preventing prolonged inflammation and cellular transformation. Subsequent
      mechanistic studies in vitro suggest that DADS chemopreventive effects are
      mediated through NF-kappaB signaling. When SW480 colorectal cancer cells were
      treated with DADS, NF-kappaB nuclear localization and activity were diminished.
      Interestingly, NF-kappaB suppression was found to be dependent on DADS inhibition
      of GSK-3beta, a positive regulator of NF-kappaB. Inhibition of GSK-3beta and loss
      of nuclear NF-kappaB activity were also observed in vivo in AOM/DSS-treated mice 
      fed a diet supplemented with 85 ppm DADS. Our results indicate that DADS can
      prevent tumorigenesis by suppressing inflammation, a process largely involving
      GSK-3beta inhibition and consequential reduction in NF-kappaB nuclear
      localization. Cancer Prev Res; 9(7); 607-15. (c)2016 AACR.

TI  - Dairy Products, Dietary Calcium, and Risk of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Results 
      From a European Prospective Cohort Investigation.
PG  - 1403-11
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000798 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dairy products may be involved in the etiology of inflammatory bowel 
      disease by modulating gut microbiota and immune responses, but data from
      epidemiological studies examining this relationship are limited. We investigated 
      the association between prediagnostic intake of these foods and dietary calcium, 
      and the subsequent development of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis
      (UC). METHODS: In total, 401,326 participants were enrolled in the European
      Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort. At recruitment,
      consumption of total and specific dairy products (milk, yogurt, and cheese) and
      dietary calcium was measured using validated food frequency questionnaires. Cases
      developing incident CD (n = 110) or UC (n = 244) during follow-up were matched
      with 4 controls. Conditional logistic regression analyses were used to calculate 
      odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for total energy 
      intake and smoking. RESULTS: Compared with the lowest quartile, the ORs for the
      highest quartile of total dairy products and dietary calcium intake were 0.61
      (95% CI, 0.32-1.19, p trend = 0.19) and 0.63 (95% CI, 0.28-1.42, p trend = 0.23) 
      for CD, and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.50-1.30, p trend = 0.40) and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.49-1.34,
      p trend = 0.60) for UC, respectively. Compared with nonconsumers, individuals
      consuming milk had significantly reduced odds of CD (OR 0.30, 95% CI, 0.13-0.65) 
      and nonsignificantly reduced odds of UC (OR 0.85, 95% CI, 0.49-1.47).
      CONCLUSIONS: Milk consumption may be associated with a decreased risk of
      developing CD, although a clear dose-response relationship was not established.
      Further studies are warranted to confirm this possible protective effect.

AB  - Survey aims were to investigate the dietary concerns, beliefs and opinions of
      people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and differences between those with 
      Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). A cross-sectional postal
      questionnaire was sent to people with IBD who were booked into an adult IBD or
      Gastroenterology clinic over a 6-week period. There were 416 eligible people and 
      168 (40%) responded. Sixty-four (42%) people indicated that food affects their
      symptoms a lot or severely. Eighty (51%) respondents indicated that diet was
      important or extremely important in controlling symptoms. Significantly more
      people with CD reported meat, fatty foods, chocolate and salad as a trigger than 
      people with UC. Significantly more people with UC reported wheat as a trigger.
      More people with CD avoided meat and chocolate than UC. This survey highlights
      the importance of nutrition and diet to people with IBD. Frequent food avoidance 
      was reported. This may impact on nutrition-related health problems.

TI  - L-Arginine Availability and Metabolism Is Altered in Ulcerative Colitis.
PG  - 1847-58
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000790 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: L-arginine (L-Arg) is the substrate for both inducible nitric oxide
      (NO) synthase (NOS2) and arginase (ARG) enzymes. L-Arg is actively transported
      into cells by means of cationic amino acid transporter (SLC7) proteins. We have
      linked L-Arg and arginase 1 activity to epithelial restitution. Our aim was to
      determine if L-Arg, related amino acids, and metabolic enzymes are altered in
      ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Serum and colonic tissues were prospectively
      collected from 38 control subjects and 137 UC patients. Dietary intake,
      histologic injury, and clinical disease activity were assessed. Amino acid levels
      were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Messenger RNA (mRNA)
      levels were measured by real-time PCR. Colon tissue samples from 12 Crohn's
      disease patients were obtained for comparison. RESULTS: Dietary intake of
      arginine and serum L-Arg levels were not different in UC patients versus control 
      subjects. In active UC, tissue L-Arg was decreased, whereas L-citrulline (L-Cit) 
      and the L-Cit/L-Arg ratio were increased. This pattern was also seen when paired 
      involved (left) versus uninvolved (right) colon tissues in UC were assessed. In
      active UC, SLC7A2 and ARG1 mRNA levels were decreased, whereas ARG2 and NOS2 were
      increased. Similar alterations in mRNA expression occurred in tissues from
      Crohn's disease patients. In involved UC, SLC7A2 and ARG1 mRNA levels were
      decreased, and NOS2 and ARG2 increased, when compared with uninvolved tissues.
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients with UC exhibit diminished tissue L-Arg, likely
      attributable to decreased cellular uptake and increased consumption by NOS2.
      These findings combined with decreased ARG1 expression indicate a pattern of
      dysregulated L-Arg availability and metabolism in UC.

TI  - Dietary Lipid Type, Rather Than Total Number of Calories, Alters Outcomes of
      Enteric Infection in Mice.
PG  - 1846-56
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiw084 [doi]
AB  - Dietary lipids modulate immunity, yet the means by which specific fatty acids
      affect infectious disease susceptibility remains unclear. Deciphering
      lipid-induced immunity is critical to understanding the balance required for
      protecting against pathogens while avoiding chronic inflammatory diseases. To
      understand how specific lipids alter susceptibility to enteric infection, we fed 
      mice isocaloric, high-fat diets composed of corn oil (rich in n-6 polyunsaturated
      fatty acids [n-6 PUFAs]), olive oil (rich in monounsaturated fatty acids), or
      milk fat (rich in saturated fatty acids) with or without fish oil (rich in n-3
      PUFAs). After 5 weeks of dietary intervention, mice were challenged with
      Citrobacter rodentium, and pathological responses were assessed. Olive oil diets 
      resulted in little colonic pathology associated with intestinal alkaline
      phosphatase, a mucosal defense factor that detoxifies lipopolysaccharide. In
      contrast, while both corn oil and milk fat diets resulted in inflammation-induced
      colonic damage, only milk fat induced compensatory protective responses,
      including short chain fatty acid production. Fish oil combined with milk fat,
      unlike unsaturated lipid diets, had a protective effect associated with
      intestinal alkaline phosphatase activity. Overall, these results reveal that
      dietary lipid type, independent of the total number of calories associated with
      the dietary lipid, influences the susceptibility to enteric damage and the
      benefits of fish oil during infection.

      disease.
PG  - 669-76
LID - 10.1111/imj.13094 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Barwon area in Australia has one of the highest incidence rates
      of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and therefore is an ideal location to study
      the impact of environmental exposures on the disease's development. AIM: To study
      these exposures prior to the development of IBD in a population-based cohort.
      METHOD: One hundred and thirty-two incident cases (81 Crohn disease (CD) and 51
      ulcerative colitis (UC)) from an IBD registry and 104 controls replied to the
      International Organization of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases environmental
      questionnaire. This included 87 questions about pre-illness exposures that
      included childhood illnesses, vaccinations, breastfeeding, house amenities, pets 
      and swimming, diet and smoking. RESULTS: The factors associated with CD included 
      smoking (odds ratio (OR): 1.42, confidence interval (CI): 1-2.02, P = 0.029);
      childhood events, including tonsillectomy (OR: 1.74, CI: 1.15-2.6, P = 0.003) and
      chicken pox infection (OR: 3.89, CI: 1.61-9.4, P = 0.005) and pre-diagnosis
      intake of frequent fast food (OR: 2.26, CI: 1.76-4.33, P = 0.003). In UC, the
      risk factors included smoking (OR: 1.39, CI: 1.1-1.92, P = 0.026) and
      pre-diagnosis intake of frequent fast food (OR: 2.91, CI: 1.54-5.58, P < 0.001), 
      and high caffeine intake was protective (OR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.3-0.87, P = 0.002). 
      Other protective exposures for UC included high fruit intake (OR: 0.59, CI:
      0.4-0.88, P = 0.003) and having pets as a child (OR: 0.36, CI: 0.2-0.79, P =
      0.001). CONCLUSION: This first Australian population-based study of environmental
      risk factors confirms that smoking, childhood immunological events and dietary
      factors play a role in IBD development; while high caffeine intake and pet
      ownership offer a protective effect.

TI  - Onset of Ulcerative Colitis after Helicobacter pylori Eradication Therapy: A Case
      Report.
PG  - e115-8
LID - 10.7812/TPP/15-085 [doi]
AB  - In Japan, Helicobacter pylori eradication has been approved since 2013 for
      treatment of H pylori-induced chronic gastritis, in an attempt to reduce the
      prevalence of gastric cancer, a leading cancer in Japan. H pylori infection
      affects more than 50% of the world's population. H pylori eradication therapy is 
      generally safe. To our knowledge, no case of newly diagnosed ulcerative colitis
      occurring immediately after H pylori eradication therapy has previously been
      reported.A 63-year-old man received a diagnosis of chronic gastritis and H pylori
      infection. In early March 2014, primary H pylori eradication therapy was
      initiated; lansoprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin were administered for 1 
      week. Beginning on the fourth day, he had watery diarrhea twice a day. From the
      11th day, bloody stools and watery diarrhea increased to 6 times a day.
      Colonoscopy, performed on the 40th day after termination of drug therapy,
      revealed diffuse inflammation in the distal aspect of the colon, with histologic 
      findings consistent with ulcerative colitis. He was admitted to the hospital and 
      was provided with a semivegetarian diet and metronidazole. He noticed a gradual
      decrease in the amount of blood in his feces then a disappearance of the blood. A
      fecal occult blood test on the 11th hospital day recorded 337 ng/mL. Fecal occult
      blood test is not indicated during macroscopic bloody stool but is indicated
      after disappearance of bloody stool. Therefore, he achieved clinical remission by
      the 11th hospital day. He was in remission on discharge.New onset of ulcerative
      colitis should be added to a list of adverse events of H pylori eradication
      therapy.

LID - 10.1080/01635581.2016.1152385 [doi]
AB  - Diet and inflammation have been suggested to be important risk factors for
      ulcerative colitis (UC). In this case-control study conducted in Iran, we
      examined the ability of the dietary inflammatory index (DII) to predict UC. This 
      study included 62 UC cases and 124 controls hospitalized for acute non-neoplastic
      diseases. The DII was computed based on dietary intake assessed by a previously
      validated food frequency questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regression models 
      were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and the DII was analyzed as both
      continuous and as tertiles. Energy was adjusted using the residual method.
      Subjects with higher DII scores (i.e., with a more pro-inflammatory diet) had a
      higher risk of UC, with the DII being used as both a continuous variable
      (OR(continuous) 1.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-2.32; one unit increase
      corresponding to approximately 8% of its range in the current study) and as
      tertiles (OR(tertile3vstertile1) 2.58, 95% CI 1.03-6.48, P(trend)| = |0.04).
      These results indicate that a pro-inflammatory diet is associated with increased 
      risk of UC.

      monounsaturated fatty acids potentiate the beneficial effects of fish oil on risk
      factors of cardiovascular disease. In the present study, we have investigated the
      influence of MCT or olive oil on the protective and mucosal healing ability of
      fish oil in ulcerative colitis using cell simulation and animal models. Caco-2
      cells grown in medium chain fatty acids enriched medium has exaggerated t-butyl
      hydroperoxide induced cell damage, GSH depletion, and IL-1beta induced IL-8
      synthesis, compared to the cells grown in oleic acid & hydroxytyrosol (OT)
      enriched medium. Further, combined treatment of cells with eicosapentaenoic acid,
      docosahexaenoic acid, and OT has remarkably attenuated the cell damage, and IL-8 
      synthesis, compared to individual treatments. To evaluate the effect of these
      lipid formulations in vivo, adult Wistar rats were fed diet enriched with high
      amount of medium chain triglycerides (MCT), virgin olive oil, or their
      combination with fish oil. Colitis was induced in rats using dextran sulfate
      sodium (DSS) for 7days followed by 10-days of recovery period. Rats of MCT group 
      exhibit severe disease activity, higher levels of inflammatory cytokines in the
      colon compared to the olive oil group. Furthermore, there was persistent body
      weight loss, loose stools, higher levels of inflammatory cytokines in the rats of
      MCT group, even after DSS was withdrawn from drinking water. Conversely, fish oil
      has remarkably attenuated the DSS induced alterations in both MCT and olive oil
      diet groups with significantly greater effect in the olive oil group. Thus, MCT
      increase the susceptibility to colitis through oxidative damage and IL-8
      synthesis in intestinal epithelial cells. The beneficial effects of virgin olive 
      oil could be partially attributed to hydroxytyrosol. Combined treatment of
      hydroxytyrosol, oleic acid and n-3 fatty acids exhibit huge therapeutic benefits 
      in colitis.

AB  - Interactions between the host and its associated microbiota differ spatially and 
      the local cross talk determines organ function and physiology. Animals and their 
      organs are not uniform but contain several functional and cellular compartments
      and gradients. In the intestinal tract, different parts of the gut carry out
      different functions, tissue structure varies accordingly, epithelial cells are
      differentially distributed and gradients exist for several physicochemical
      parameters such as nutrients, pH, or oxygen. Consequently, the microbiota
      composition also differs along the length of the gut, but also between lumen and 
      mucosa of the same intestinal segment, and even along the crypt-villus axis in
      the epithelium. Thus, host-microbiota interactions are highly site-specific and
      the local cross talk determines intestinal function and physiology. Here we
      review recent advances in our understanding of site-specific host-microbiota
      interactions and discuss their functional relevance for host physiology.

TI  - IBD and Environment: Are There Differences between East and West.
PG  - 84-9
LID - 10.1159/000442933 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), Crohn's disease (CD) and
      ulcerative colitis (UC) occur worldwide with differences in epidemiology,
      etiology and phenotype between regions. Breakthroughs have occurred in IBD
      genetics, although the genes that predispose to IBD differ between racial groups.
      What do we know about the 'envirotype' of those who develop IBD, and are there
      differences between the East and the West? KEY MESSAGES: The strongest IBD risk
      factor identified to date is a family history of IBD. Whilst likely representing 
      an underlying genetic predisposition, it may also reflect shared environmental
      factors amongst family members. Cigarette smoking increases the risk of
      developing CD, whilst smoking is less common in those who develop UC. Having
      ceased smoking increases the risk of developing UC subsequently. Unlike the West,
      cigarette smoking appears to play a lesser role in the East. Other environmental 
      risk factors are inconsistent. Studies of migrant populations moving from regions
      of low to high IBD incidence point to early life as a key time for environmental 
      triggers. In these populations, it is the second generation (those born in the
      high incidence region) with higher IBD incidence rates than their parents. Early 
      life environmental exposures have been studied exhaustively but, except for
      having been breastfed, few putative early childhood environmental risk factors
      have been shown consistently to alter the risk of developing IBD. CONCLUSIONS:
      The identification of IBD environmental risk factors remains elusive in both the 
      East and West. In the West, case-control studies are unlikely to move the field
      forward without multi-level (phenotype, genotype, diet history, 'envirotype' and 
      microbiome) data, ideally collected prospectively. Cohort studies (such as the
      Genes, Environment, Microbiome project) may address some of these issues.
      However, in the East where IBD incidence is still increasing, well-designed
      comprehensive case-control studies may identify differences that give an insight 
      into the 'envirotype' driving IBD incidence.

TI  - Smoking and Diet: Impact on Disease Course?
PG  - 72-7
LID - 10.1159/000442930 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The impact of current smoking on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      course has been studied extensively; smoking is deleterious in Crohn's disease
      (CD), and beneficial in ulcerative colitis (UC). Except for enteral nutrition,
      there are only limited data regarding the impact of diet on disease course. KEY
      MESSAGES: Current smoking worsens the course of CD, increasing the incidence of
      flares, the need for steroids, immunosuppressants and re-operations. Conversely, 
      smoking cessation has a rapid beneficial effect on disease course, decreasing the
      risk of flares and of post-operative recurrences. From 3 months after the quit
      date, quitters have a disease course similar to that of never smokers. Achieving 
      smoking cessation in CD is thus an important goal of therapy. On the contrary,
      smoking improves the course of UC and in particular, is associated with a
      decreased need for colectomy. Smoking cessation increases the risk of flare and
      the need for steroids or immunosuppressants. However, patients with UC should not
      be discouraged to quit, because the beneficial effect of smoking for their
      disease is counterbalanced by the deleterious systemic effects of tobacco. Among 
      dietary interventions, only exclusive enteral nutrition was shown to induce
      remission and achieve mucosal healing in some patients with CD. The beneficial
      effect of liquid-defined diet is observed whatever be the type of administration 
      (orally or by tube), the type of diet regarding protein and fat content and
      resulting alterations in the gut microbiota. In UC, enteral nutrition has no
      effect. Finally, popularized restrictive diets in IBD as the
      specific-carbohydrate diet and the gluten-free diet have not been rigorously
      tested. In a small trial, a semi-vegetarian diet was shown to be effective in
      maintaining remission over 2 years in CD. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD should
      not smoke and avoid passive smoking. Aside from the defined liquid diets, there
      is no rationale for advising particular diets.

PG  - 437-44
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000001170 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Diet assessment is essential in the care of patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We aimed to study food intake in children with 
      IBD and evaluated the relation of dietary intake with disease activity and
      nutritional status in these children. METHODS: This cross-sectional study
      investigated 68 children and adolescents with IBD (57 Crohn disease, 11
      ulcerative colitis). Evaluation included clinical, laboratory, and nutritional
      assessment including 3 days diet record. RESULTS: Compared with recommended daily
      allowance, the intake of patients with IBD was significantly poor for
      carbohydrates (75%, P = 0.016), calcium (49%, P < 0.05), magnesium (76%, P <
      0.05), vitamin A (72%, P < 0.05), vitamin E (57%, P < 0.05), and fiber (44%, P < 
      0.05) and higher for protein (175%, P < 0.05), iron (112%, P < 0.05), and
      water-soluble vitamins (118%-189% P < 0.05). Compared with the intakes of healthy
      children from National Nutritional Survey, the intake of IBD group was lower for 
      calories (78%, P = 0.012), carbohydrates (61% P < 0.05), magnesium (67% P <
      0.05), vitamin C (34%, P < 0.05), and fiber (54%, P < 0.05) and high for B12
      (141%, P < 0.05). Fifty subjects ate ordinary diets, 7 of 68 children were on
      exclusive enteral nutrition and 11 of 68 consumed regular food with different
      polymeric formulas supplements. Compared with children without supplements,
      children on exclusive enteral nutrition and nutritional supplements (18/68) had
      significantly better intakes of energy (1870 +/- 755 vs 2267 +/- 432, P < 0.05), 
      carbohydrates (223 +/- 97 vs 292 +/- 99, P < 0.05), and all minerals (P < 0.05)
      and micronutrients (P < 0.05). Dietary intake was not different by disease status
      (remission or relapse). CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of nutritional supplements,
      food intake is inadequate for many nutrients in many children with IBD.

AB  - Prolonged ingestion of a cholesterol-enriched diet induces chronic,
      auto-inflammatory responses resulting in significant health problems including
      colorectal cancer. Inflammasomes are thought to mediate intestinal homeostasis,
      and their dysregulation contributes to inflammatory bowel diseases and
      colitis-associated cancer (CAC). However, in vitro and in vivo information
      regarding the inflammation-inducing and tumor-promoting effect of cholesterol is 
      lacking. Here we show that the cholesterol promoted colon carcinogenesis in
      azoxymethane (AOM)-treated mice through activating the NLRP3 inflammasome. High
      cholesterol diet (HCD) significantly increased inflammatory responses and tumor
      burden. Cholesterol crystals, detected in the colon of mice fed with HCD, also
      promoted NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages, as indicated by elevated
      expression of cleaved caspase-1, formation of NLRP3-ASC-caspase-1 complex
      assembly, and higher IL-1beta secretion. Importantly, cholesterol was found to
      inhibit the activity of AMPKalpha in macrophages, leading to a significant
      production of mitochondrial ROS, which in turn activated the NLRP3 inflammasome. 
      Moreover, crystal uptake and cathepsin B accounted for cholesterol
      crystal-induced inactivation of AMPKalpha. Finally, HCD-induced increase in
      IL-1beta secretion, macrophage infiltration and tumor burden was diminished by
      the deletion of NLRP3 in AOM-treated mice. Taken together, our findings
      demonstrate that the pro-inflammatory and cancer-promoting effects of HCD are
      mediated by the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Our study extended our
      knowledge on how dietary choices can influence processes involved in chronic
      inflammatory disorders and colorectal cancer.

TI  - Diet therapy for inflammatory bowel diseases: The established and the new.
PG  - 2179-94

AB  - Although patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have a strong interest
      in dietary modifications as part of their therapeutic management, dietary advice 
      plays only a minor part in published guidelines. The scientific literature shows 
      that dietary factors might influence the risk of developing IBD, that dysbiosis
      induced by nutrition contributes to the pathogenesis of IBD, and that diet may
      serve as a symptomatic treatment for irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms in
      IBD. The role of nutrition in IBD is underscored by the effect of various dietary
      therapies. In paediatric patients with Crohn's disease (CD) enteral nutrition
      (EN) reaches remission rates similar to steroids. In adult patients, however, EN 
      is inferior to corticosteroids. EN is not effective in ulcerative colitis (UC).
      Total parenteral nutrition in IBD is not superior to steroids or EN. The use of
      specific probiotics in patients with IBD can be recommended only in special
      clinical situations. There is no evidence for efficacy of probiotics in CD. By
      contrast, studies in UC have shown a beneficial effect in selected patients. For 
      patients with pouchitis, antibiotic treatment followed by probiotics, like VSL#3 
      or Lactobacillus GG, is effective. When probiotics are used, the risk of
      bacterial translocation and subsequent bacteremia has to be considered. More
      understanding of the normal intestinal microflora, and better characterization of
      probiotic strains at the phenotypic and genomic levels is needed as well as
      clarification of the mechanisms of action in different clinical settings. A
      FODMAP reduced diet may improve symptoms in IBD.

TI  - [Ulcerative colitis in a 6-year-old boy with severe coeliac disease - a case
      report].
PG  - 21-4
AB  - Coeliac disease is a chronic immune-mediated inflammation of the small intestine 
      elicited by the gluten ingestion in genetically susceptible people. In coeliac
      patients there is higher incidence of other autoimmune disorders like type 1
      diabetes or Hashimoto's thyroiditis. The coexistence of coeliac disease and
      inflammatory bowel disease is rare. The spectrum of presentation of coeliac
      disease and inflammatory bowel disease may be similar. However, those disorders
      require various therapeutic approaches. Thus, early recognition of the overlap
      between coeliac disease and inflammatory bowel disease is crucial to apply
      appropriate treatment and to prevent possible complications. We report a case of 
      a 6-year-old boy with a delay in physical and psychomotor development, rickets,
      severe anaemia and bloody diarrhoea. He was diagnosed with coeliac disease and
      ulcerative disease. The coexistence of both disorders is extremely rare in
      childhood. However, ulcerative colitis should be considered in coeliac children
      on restrictive gluten-free diet with persistent diarrhoea or bleeding from lower 
      gastrointestinal tract. Screening for coeliac disease should be considered in
      children with ulcerative colitis with impaired physical development and lack of
      remission despite of proper treatment.

TI  - [Meta-analysis on causes of ulcerative colitis].
PG  - 1419-23
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the main influencing factor of ulcerative colitis (UC).
      METHODS: Literature retrieval was conducted by using English databases (PubMed,
      Cochrane and Embase) and Chinese databases (CNKI, Wanfang, SinoMed and VIP) to
      collect the studies on the influencing factors of UC published both at home and
      abroad from January 2000 to October 2014. According to the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria, data were extracted and methodological quality was assessed. 
      Then, a Meta-analysis was performed with Stata 12.0 software. RESULTS: A total of
      24 case-control studies were included, involving 5 653 patients and 20 218
      controls. The results of Meta-analysis showed that the influencing factors of UC 
      would include family history of inflammatory bowel disease, ex-smoker,
      gastrointestinal infections, regular consumption of milk, fat diet, appendectomy,
      smoking and high educational level, with the pooled OR values as 4.68
      (95%CI:3.59-6.11) , 1.81 (95%CI: 1.58-2.09) , 5.10 (95%CI: 2.38-10.92) , 2.26
      (95%CI: 1.65-3.09) , 2.21 (95%CI: 1.49-3.27) , 0.40 (95%CI:0.32-0.51) , 0.44
      (95%CI:0.32-0.60) and 0.50 (95%CI:0.36-0.69) , respectively. CONCLUSION: Current 
      evidence showed that the risk factors influencing the incidence of UC were family
      history of inflammatory bowel disease, ex-smoker, gastrointestinal infections,
      regular consumption of milk and fat diet, whereas appendectomy, smoking and high 
      educational level were protective factors for UC.

TI  - Titanium dioxide nanoparticles exacerbate DSS-induced colitis: role of the NLRP3 
      inflammasome.
PG  - 1216-1224
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2015-310297 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Western lifestyle and diet are major environmental factors playing a
      role in the development of IBD. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles are widely 
      used as food additives or in pharmaceutical formulations and are consumed by
      millions of people on a daily basis. We investigated the effects of TiO2 in the
      development of colitis and the role of the nucleotide-binding oligomerisation
      domain receptor, pyrin domain containing (NLRP)3 inflammasome. DESIGN: Wild-type 
      and NLRP3-deficient mice with dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis were orally 
      administered with TiO2 nanoparticles. The proinflammatory effects of TiO2
      particles in cultured human intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and macrophages
      were also studied, as well as the ability of TiO2 crystals to traverse IEC
      monolayers and accumulate in the blood of patients with IBD using inductively
      coupled plasma mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Oral administration of TiO2
      nanoparticles worsened acute colitis through a mechanism involving the NLRP3
      inflammasome. Importantly, crystals were found to accumulate in spleen of
      TiO2-administered mice. In vitro, TiO2 particles were taken up by IECs and
      macrophages and triggered NLRP3-ASC-caspase-1 assembly, caspase-1 cleavage and
      the release of NLRP3-associated interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-18. TiO2 also
      induced reactive oxygen species generation and increased epithelial permeability 
      in IEC monolayers. Increased levels of titanium were found in blood of patients
      with UC having active disease. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that
      individuals with a defective intestinal barrier function and pre-existing
      inflammatory condition, such as IBD, might be negatively impacted by the use of
      TiO2 nanoparticles.

TI  - Advancing nutritional therapy: A novel polymeric formulation attenuates
      intestinal inflammation in a murine colitis model and suppresses pro-inflammatory
      cytokine production in ex-vivo cultured inflamed colonic biopsies.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nutritional therapy is a viable therapeutic option for the
      treatment of Crohn disease (CD). Therefore improving nutritional therapy would
      greatly benefit CD patients. The aim of this study was to define the
      anti-inflammatory properties of a novel nutritional polymeric formula (PF) in
      comparison to a currently available standard PF. METHODS: Dextran sodium sulfate 
      (DSS) was utilized to induce colitis in C57BL/6 mice with mice randomized to
      receive either standard PF or novel PF in addition to control groups. Changes in 
      body weight were recorded and colonic damage was assessed histologically and
      biochemically. Additional experiments were also included where the cytokine
      response of colonic biopsies from pediatric CD patients was measured following
      exposure to standard PF or novel PF. RESULTS: DSS induced significant body weight
      loss, morphological changes in the colon, increased myeloperoxidase (MPO)
      activity and up-regulated colonic mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-12 and monocyte chemoattractant protein
      (MCP)-1, as well as associated histological changes. Other than histological
      damage, these inflammatory changes were reversed by both novel and standard PF.
      However, the novel PF, but not standard PF, completely suppressed TNF-alpha, IL-6
      and IL-8 levels from cultured biopsies. CONCLUSIONS: Newly developed nutritional 
      formula reproducibly ameliorated DSS-induced colitis in a murine model, although 
      this response was not measurably different to standard PF. However, the novel PF 
      was significantly superior in suppressing inflammatory cytokine release from
      cultured colonic biopsies. Collectively, these findings support a possible role
      for novel PF in advancing nutritional therapy for CD patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the interaction of single nucleotide polymorphisms of
      macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) gene -173G/C and glutathione
      peroxidase 1(GPX1) gene 594C/T polymorphisms and high-fat diet in ulcerative
      colitis (UC). METHODS: The genetic polymorphisms of MIF -173G/C and GPX1 594C/T
      were determined with a polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-endonuclease 
      method in peripheral blood leukocytes derived from 1500 UC cases and 1500 healthy
      controls. RESULTS: The frequencies of MIF -173CC and GPX1 594TT were 55.60% and
      55.73% in the UC cases and 16.67% and 16.47% in the healthy controls,
      respectively. Statistical tests also showed a significant difference in the
      frequencies between the two groups (P<0.01; P<0.01, respectively). Individuals
      carrying MIF -173CC also had a significantly higher risk of UC compared with
      those with MIF -173GG (OR=6.8662, 95%CI: 4.5384-9.6158). Individuals carrying
      GPX1 594TT had a high risk of UC (OR=7.0854, 95%CI: 4.4702-10.5283). Combined
      analysis showed that the percentages of MIF -173CC/GPX1 594TT in the UC and
      control groups were 31.00% and 2.73%, respectively (P<0.01). Individuals carrying
      MIF -173CC/GPX1 594TT had a high risk of UC (OR=49.0113, 95%CI: 31.7364-61.8205).
      The high-fat diet rate of the case group was significantly higher than that of
      the control group (OR=3.3248, 95%CI: 1.9461-5.0193, P<0.01), and statistic
      analysis suggested an interaction between high-fat diet and MIF -173CC and GPX1
      594TT which increase risk of UC (gamma =6.9293; gamma =6.9942). CONCLUSION: MIF
      -173CC and GPX1 594TT and high-fat diet are the risk factors for UC, and the
      significant interactions between genetic polymorphisms of MIF -173G/C, GPX1
      594C/T and high-fat diet may increase the risk for UC.

LID - 10.1097/SGA.0000000000000201 [doi]
AB  - The study objective was to investigate the nature and perceived effectiveness of 
      strategies that patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) use in response to
      worsening symptoms. Questionnaires to investigate the use and perceived
      effectiveness of 11 types of strategies for coping with possible flare-ups were
      mailed to 1,641 members of the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of Japan. The
      responses were analyzed separately by disease type: ulcerative colitis (UC) and
      Crohn disease (CD). A total of 400 questionnaires were analyzed from 260 UC and
      140 CD patients. The strategies used most by both patient groups were "change
      contents of meals" and "get more sleep." In addition, "skip some meals" was
      commonly used by CD patients. The most effective strategies were "use extra
      topical corticosteroids" (30 of the 56 subjects, 53.6%) among UC patients, and
      "skip some meals" (70 of the 114 subjects, 61.4%), and "take/add to the elemental
      diet" (53 of 89 subjects, 59.6%) among CD patients. The coping strategies used
      most by patients with IBD involved lifestyle modifications. However, the
      additional use of medications was regarded as the most effective, despite the
      small number of patients who used this strategy. Additional use of topical
      medications for UC patients and diet modifications for CD patients should be
      emphasized in self-management education for patients.

TI  - Onset of Ulcerative Colitis during a Low-Carbohydrate Weight-Loss Diet and
      Treatment with a Plant-Based Diet: A Case Report.
PG  - 80-4
LID - 10.7812/TPP/15-038 [doi]
AB  - Overweight and obesity are global health concerns. Various effective weight-loss 
      diets have been developed, including the Atkins diet. The Atkins diet is known as
      an extreme low-carbohydrate diet. This diet reduces body weight and has gained
      widespread popularity. However, the metabolite profiles of such a diet have been 
      shown to be detrimental to colonic health. Therefore, a concern for the long-term
      health effects of this diet exists. We encountered a case in which ulcerative
      colitis developed while the patient was following the Atkins diet.A man, 172 cm
      in height and weighing 72 kg, at age 36 years followed a low-carbohydrate
      weight-loss diet. His weight decreased to 66 kg as desired. Thereafter he noticed
      bloody stool. Colonoscopy revealed diffuse inflammation limited to the rectum,
      and he was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. He underwent an educational
      hospitalization for ulcerative colitis. A plant-based/semivegetarian diet was
      provided during hospitalization. Bloody stool disappeared during hospitalization 
      and he achieved remission without medication for inflammatory bowel disease.This 
      case indicates that an onset of ulcerative colitis can be an adverse event to a
      low-carbohydrate weight-loss diet.

PG  - 1088-100
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i3.1088 [doi]
AB  - Numerous environmental factors have been linked with inflammatory bowel disease. 
      These include smoking, diet, hygiene, drugs, geographical and psychosocial
      factors. These factors may either increase the risk of or protect against
      developing this condition and can also affect the course of illness in a positive
      or negative manner. A number of studies have examined the influence of
      environmental factors on inflammatory bowel diseases as a whole as well as on
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease separately. As there are differences in
      the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, the effect of
      environmental factors on their onset and course is not always similar. Some
      factors have shown a consistent association, while reports on others have been
      conflicting. In this article we discuss the current evidence on the roles of
      these factors on inflammatory bowel disease, both as causative/protective agents 
      and as modifiers of disease course.

PG  - 1045-66
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i3.1045 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
      disease are chronic, life-long, and relapsing diseases of the gastrointestinal
      tract. Currently, there are no complete cure possibilities, but combined
      pharmacological and nutritional therapy may induce remission of the disease.
      Malnutrition and specific nutritional deficiencies are frequent among IBD
      patients, so the majority of them need nutritional treatment, which not only
      improves the state of nutrition of the patients but has strong anti-inflammatory 
      activity as well. Moreover, some nutrients, from early stages of life are
      suspected as triggering factors in the etiopathogenesis of IBD. Both parenteral
      and enteral nutrition is used in IBD therapy, but their practical utility in
      different populations and in different countries is not clearly established, and 
      there are sometimes conflicting theories concerning the role of nutrition in IBD.
      This review presents the actual data from research studies on the influence of
      nutrition on the etiopathogenesis of IBD and the latest findings regarding its
      mechanisms of action. The use of both parenteral and enteral nutrition as
      therapeutic methods in induction and maintenance therapy in IBD treatment is also
      extensively discussed. Comparison of the latest research data, scientific
      theories concerning the role of nutrition in IBD, and different opinions about
      them are also presented and discussed. Additionally, some potential future
      perspectives for nutritional therapy are highlighted.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) development is affected by complex interactions 
      between environmental factors, changes in intestinal flora, various predisposing 
      genetic properties and changes in the immune system. Dietary factors seem to play
      an underestimated role in the etiopathogenesis and course of the disease.
      However, research about food and IBD is conflicting. An excessive consumption of 
      sugar, animal fat and linoleic acid is considered a risk factor for IBD
      development, whereas a high fiber diet and citrus fruit consumption may play a
      protective role. Also, appropriate nutrition in particular periods of the disease
      may facilitate achieving or prolonging remissions and most of all, improve the
      quality of life for patients. During disease exacerbation, a low fiber diet is
      recommended for most patients. In the remission time, an excessive consumption of
      alcohol and sulfur products may have a negative effect on the disease course.
      Attempts are also made at employing diets composed in detail in order to
      supplement IBD therapy. A diet with a modified carbohydrate composition, a
      semi-vegetarian diet and a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides,
      disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols are under investigation. Due to
      chronic inflammation as well as side effects of chronically used medications,
      patients with IBD are also at increased risk of nutritional factor deficiencies, 
      including iron, calcium, vitamin D, vitamin B12, folic acid, zinc, magnesium and 
      vitamin A. It should also be remembered that there is no single common diet
      suitable for all IBD patients; each of them is unique and dietary recommendations
      must be individually developed for each patient, depending on the course of the
      disease, past surgical procedures and type of pharmacotherapy.

TI  - Avoidance of Fiber Is Associated With Greater Risk of Crohn's Disease Flare in a

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) have been
      associated with an abnormal mucosal response to the gastrointestinal microbiota. 
      Although dietary fiber affects the gastrointestinal microbiota, there is limited 
      information on the role of fiber on IBD activity. We investigated factors
      associated with fiber consumption and whether it was associated with flares in
      patients with IBD. METHODS: We collected a completed 26-item dietary survey from 
      1619 participants in the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America Partners
      Internet cohort (Crohn's disease, 1130; ulcerative colitis/indeterminate colitis,
      489). Eligible individuals were in remission based on disease activity index at
      baseline and completed a follow-up survey 6 months later. Fiber and whole grain
      consumption were categorized into quartiles and deciles. Disease flare at 6
      months was defined as a disease activity index score exceeding remission cutoff
      values, and/or an IBD-related surgical procedure or hospitalization since
      baseline. RESULTS: Participants with longer duration of disease, past history of 
      surgery, and past IBD hospitalization ate less fiber. The risks for disease flare
      differed by disease type. Compared with those in the lowest quartile of fiber
      consumption, participants with Crohn's disease in the highest quartile were less 
      likely to have a flare (adjusted odds ratios [OR], 0.58; 95% confidence interval 
      [CI], 0.37-0.90). Participants with Crohn's disease who reported that they did
      not avoid high-fiber foods were approximately 40% less likely to have a disease
      flare than those who avoided high-fiber foods (adjusted OR, 0.59; 95% CI,
      0.43-0.81). There was no association between fiber intake and flares in patients 
      with ulcerative colitis (adjusted OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 0.92-3.60). CONCLUSIONS:
      Intake of dietary fiber is associated with reduced disease flares in patients
      with Crohn's disease, but not UC. Recommendations to limit dietary fiber should
      be re-evaluated.

TI  - Western diet induces a shift in microbiota composition enhancing susceptibility
      to Adherent-Invasive E. coli infection and intestinal inflammation.
PG  - 19032
LID - 10.1038/srep19032 [doi]
AB  - Recent advances have shown that the abnormal inflammatory response observed in CD
      involves an interplay among intestinal microbiota, host genetics and
      environmental factors. The escalating consumption of fat and sugar in Western
      countries parallels an increased incidence of CD during the latter 20(th)
      century. The impact of a HF/HS diet in mice was evaluated for the gut
      micro-inflammation, intestinal microbiota composition, function and selection of 
      an E. coli population. The HF/HS diet created a specific inflammatory environment
      in the gut, correlated with intestinal mucosa dysbiosis characterized by an
      overgrowth of pro-inflammatory Proteobacteria such as E. coli, a decrease in
      protective bacteria, and a significantly decreased of SCFA concentrations. The
      expression of GPR43, a SCFA receptor was reduced in mice treated with a HF/HS
      diet and reduced in CD patients compared with controls. Interestingly, mice
      treated with an agonist of GPR43 were protected against DSS-induced colitis.
      Finally, the transplantation of feces from HF/HS treated mice to GF mice
      increased susceptibility to AIEC infection. Together, our results demonstrate
      that a Western diet could aggravate the inflammatory process and that the
      activation of the GPR43 receptor pathway could be used as a new strategy to treat
      CD patients.

TI  - Dietary Patterns and Risk of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Europe: Results from
      the EPIC Study.
PG  - 345-54
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000638 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Specific nutrients or foods have been inconsistently associated with 
      ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) risks. Thus, we investigated
      associations between diet as a whole, as dietary patterns, and UC and CD risks.
      METHODS: Within the prospective EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into
      Cancer) study, we set up a nested matched case-control study among 366,351
      participants with inflammatory bowel disease data, including 256 incident cases
      of UC and 117 of CD, and 4 matched controls per case. Dietary intake was recorded
      at baseline from validated food frequency questionnaires. Incidence rate ratios
      of developing UC and CD were calculated for quintiles of the Mediterranean diet
      score and a posteriori dietary patterns produced by factor analysis. RESULTS: No 
      dietary pattern was associated with either UC or CD risks. However, when
      excluding cases occurring within the first 2 years after dietary assessment,
      there was a positive association between a "high sugar and soft drinks" pattern
      and UC risk (incidence rate ratios for the fifth versus first quintile, 1.68
      [1.00-2.82]; Ptrend = 0.02). When considering the foods most associated with the 
      pattern, high consumers of sugar and soft drinks were at higher UC risk only if
      they had low vegetables intakes. CONCLUSIONS: A diet imbalance with high
      consumption of sugar and soft drinks and low consumption of vegetables was
      associated with UC risk. Further studies are needed to investigate whether
      microbiota alterations or other mechanisms mediate this association.

      enteral nutrition (EEN), has not had a defined role within the treatment paradigm
      of pediatric IBD within IBD centers. Based on emerging data, Seattle Children's
      Hospital IBD Center has developed an integrated dietary program incorporating the
      specific carbohydrate diet (SCD) into its treatment paradigm. This treatment
      paradigm uses the SCD as primary therapy as well as adjunctive therapy for the
      treatment of IBD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential effects of 
      the SCD on clinical outcomes and laboratory studies of pediatric patients with
      Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: In this retrospective 
      study, we reviewed the medical records of patients with IBD on SCD. RESULTS: We
      analyzed 26 children on the SCD: 20 with CD and 6 with UC. Duration of the
      dietary therapy ranged from 3 to 48 mo. In patients with active CD (Pediatric
      Crohn's Disease activity index [PCDAI] >10), PCDAI dropped from 32.8 +/- 13.2 at 
      baseline to 20.8 +/- 16.6 by 4 +/- 2 wk, and to 8.8 +/- 8.5 by 6 mo. The mean
      Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index for patients with active UC decreased
      from a baseline of 28.3 +/- 10.3 to 20.0 +/- 17.3 at 4 +/- 2 wk, to 18.3 +/- 31.7
      at 6 mo. CONCLUSION: This retrospective review provides evidence that the SCD can
      be integrated into a tertiary care center and may improve clinical and laboratory
      parameters for pediatric patients with nonstructuring, nonpenetrating CD as well 
      as UC. Further prospective studies are needed to fully assess the safety and
      efficacy of the SCD in pediatric patients with IBD.

TI  - Enteral Feeding Therapy for Maintaining Remission in Crohn's Disease: A
      Systematic Review.
PG  - 550-561
LID - 10.1177/0148607115621051 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of enteral nutrition (EN) for maintaining remission in
      patients with inactive Crohn's disease (CD) is unclear. The aim of this article
      was to systematically identify, review, and critically appraise the evidence on
      efficacy of EN in maintaining medically induced remission in CD. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Several databases were searched from inception to April 2015 for
      relevant citations of published randomized controlled trials and nonrandomized
      cohort studies. Two reviewers independently selected studies for inclusion and
      assessed study quality and risk of bias. The primary outcome was relapse rate in 
      patients with inactive CD who have been in medically induced remission and
      subsequently started or maintained on EN. RESULTS: Twelve studies (1169 patients,
      including 95 children) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. As the included studies 
      were significantly heterogeneous, a meta-analysis was not performed. Eleven
      studies showed that EN was either better than, or as effective as, the comparator
      in maintaining remission in patients with inactive CD. No major EN-related
      adverse events were reported. Only 1 adult randomized controlled trial (n = 51), 
      with low risk of bias, compared EN with regular diet and found a relapse rate of 
      34% in the EN group versus 64% in the control group ( P < .01) after a mean
      follow-up of 11.9 months. CONCLUSIONS: EN is more effective than regular diet and
      as effective as some medications in maintaining remission for patients with
      inactive CD. Large, properly designed randomized controlled studies of sufficient
      duration are required to confirm this conclusion for EN versus individual
      medications.

TI  - EHealth: self-management in inflammatory bowel disease and in irritable bowel
      syndrome using novel constant-care web applications. EHealth by constant-care in 
      IBD and IBS.
PG  - B5168
LID - B5168 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
      are chronic gastrointestinal disorders of unknown aetiology of increasing
      incidence and changing disease activity or severity. Approximately 60-80% of IBD 
      patients suffer from IBS. Monitoring and treatment goals of IBD are to optimise
      the disease course by prolonging remission periods and preventing or shortening
      periods of active disease. Constant-care web-monitoring and treatment approaches 
      with active patient involvement have been proven effective in UC, increasing
      patients' adherence and improving the disease outcomes. AIM: To assess the
      feasibility and efficacy of the novel constant-care eHealth applications in: i)
      CD patients treated with infliximab (IFX), ii) UC patients with active disease on
      mesalazine, iii) IBS patients and iv) IBD patients with IBS on a low FODMAP diet 
      (LFD). METHODS: New constant-care web applications www.cd.constant-care.dk,
      www.meza.constant-care.dk and www.ibs.constant-care.dk in IBD patients were
      developed and assessed in this thesis. An integrated inflammatory burden measure 
      of disease activity, consisting of a subjective (clinical indices) and of an
      objective (faecal calprotectin) part and a treatment guide to drug doses and
      intervals, was incorporated into the web applications and used by patients.
      RESULTS: Web-guided IFX treatment in CD demonstrated patients' inter- and
      intra-individual variability in infusion intervals and provided patients with
      individualised treatment according to their needs. Web-guided treatment with
      multimatrix mesalazine was efficacious in a majority of UC patients with
      mild-to-moderate disease activity. Web-guided IBS-monitoring in IBD and in IBS
      patients on LFD was shown to be a feasible method that actively involved patients
      in their disease management and had a positive short-term impact on the disease. 
      Moreover, the new constant-care concepts were demonstrated to be safe and to have
      a positive impact on quality of life and adherence to treatment and helped to
      reduce the costs. CONCLUSIONS: The novel constant-care web applications have
      proven feasible in improving the disease outcomes in CD patients on IFX, in UC
      patients on mesalazine, and in monitoring IBS. These applications are expected to
      be implemented in the clinical practice of gastroenterology in Denmark in the
      coming years. Future studies will help to assess whether the natural disease
      course can be improved in the long-term.

AB  - Chronic diarrhoea is a common presenting symptom in both primary care medicine
      and in specialized gastroenterology clinics. It is estimated that >5% of the
      population has chronic diarrhoea and nearly 40% of these patients are older than 
      60 years. Clinicians often need to select the best diagnostic approach to these
      patients and choose between the multiple diagnostic tests available. In 2014 the 
      Catalan Society of Gastroenterology formed a working group with the main
      objective of creating diagnostic algorithms based on clinical practice and to
      evaluate diagnostic tests and the scientific evidence available for their use.
      The GRADE system was used to classify scientific evidence and strength of
      recommendations. The consensus document contains 28 recommendations and 6
      diagnostic algorithms. The document also describes criteria for referral from
      primary to specialized care.

TI  - Novel understanding of ABC transporters ABCB1/MDR/P-glycoprotein, ABCC2/MRP2, and
      ABCG2/BCRP in colorectal pathophysiology.
PG  - 11862-76
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v21.i41.11862 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To evaluate ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters in colonic
      pathophysiology as they had recently been related to colorectal cancer (CRC)
      development. METHODS: Literature search was conducted on PubMed using
      combinations of the following terms: ABC transporters, ATP binding cassette
      transporter proteins, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative, colitis, Crohn's
      disease, colorectal cancer, colitis, intestinal inflammation, intestinal
      carcinogenesis, ABCB1/P-glycoprotein (P-gp/CD243/MDR1), ABCC2/multidrug
      resistance protein 2 (MRP2) and ABCG2/breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP),
      Abcb1/Mdr1a, abcc2/Mrp2, abcg2/Bcrp, knock-out mice, tight junction, membrane
      lipid function. RESULTS: Recently, human studies reported that changes in the
      levels of ABC transporters were early events in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence
      leading to CRC. A link between ABCB1, high fat diet and gut microbes in relation 
      to colitis was suggested by the animal studies. The finding that colitis was
      preceded by altered gut bacterial composition suggests that deletion of Abcb1
      leads to fundamental changes of host-microbiota interaction. Also, high fat diet 
      increases the frequency and severity of colitis in specific pathogen-free Abcb1
      KO mice. The Abcb1 KO mice might thus serve as a model in which
      diet/environmental factors and microbes may be controlled and investigated in
      relation to intestinal inflammation. Potential molecular mechanisms include
      defective transport of inflammatory mediators and/or phospholipid translocation
      from one side to the other of the cell membrane lipid bilayer by ABC transporters
      affecting inflammatory response and/or function of tight junctions, phagocytosis 
      and vesicle trafficking. Also, diet and microbes give rise to molecules which are
      potential substrates for the ABC transporters and which may additionally affect
      ABC transporter function through nuclear receptors and transcriptional
      regulation. Another critical role of ABCB1 was suggested by the finding that
      ABCB1 expression identifies a subpopulation of pro-inflammatory Th17 cells which 
      were resistant to treatment with glucocorticoids. The evidence for the
      involvement of ABCC2 and ABCG2 in colonic pathophysiology was weak. CONCLUSION:
      ABCB1, diet, and gut microbes mutually interact in colonic inflammation, a
      well-known risk factor for CRC. Further insight may be translated into preventive
      and treatment strategies.

TI  - Probiotics: a proactive approach to health. A symposium report.
PG  - S1-15
LID - 10.1017/S0007114515004043 [doi]
AB  - This report summarises talks given at the 8th International Yakult Symposium,
      held on 23-24 April 2015 in Berlin. Two presentations explored different aspects 
      of probiotic intervention: the small intestine as a probiotic target and
      inclusion of probiotics into integrative approaches to gastroenterology.
      Probiotic recommendations in gastroenterology guidelines and current data on
      probiotic efficacy in paediatric patients were reviewed. Updates were given on
      probiotic and gut microbiota research in obesity and obesity-related diseases,
      the gut-brain axis and development of psychobiotics, and the protective effects
      of equol-producing strains for prostate cancer. Recent studies were presented on 
      probiotic benefit for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and people with HIV, as
      well as protection against the adverse effects of a short-term high-fat diet.
      Aspects of probiotic mechanisms of activity were discussed, including
      immunomodulatory mechanisms and metabolite effects, the anti-inflammatory
      properties of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, the relationship between
      periodontitis, microbial production of butyrate in the oral cavity and ageing,
      and the pathogenic mechanisms of Campylobacter. Finally, an insight was given on 
      a recent expert meeting, which re-examined the probiotic definition, advised on
      the appropriate use and scope of the term and outlined different probiotic
      categories and the prevalence of different mechanisms of activity.

TI  - Zinc intake and risk of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis: a prospective
      cohort study.
PG  - 1995-2005
LID - 10.1093/ije/dyv301 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diet plays a role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) and
      ulcerative colitis (UC). Dietary zinc may influence risk of disease through
      effects on autophagy, innate and adaptive immune response and maintenance of the 
      intestinal barrier. METHODS: We analysed data from 170 776 women from the Nurses 
      Health Study I and Nurses Health Study II, who were followed for 26 years. Zinc
      intake was assessed using semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaires
      administered every 4 years. Incident CD and UC were ascertained by medical record
      review. Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for potential confounders
      determined the independent association between zinc intake and incident disease. 
      RESULTS: Over 3 317 550 person-years (p-y) of follow-up, we identified 269
      incident cases of CD and 338 incident cases of UC. Zinc intake ranged from 9
      mg/day in the lowest quintile to 27 mg/day in the highest quintile. Compared with
      women with the lowest quintile of intake, the multivariate hazard ratios (HR) for
      CD were 0.92 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.65 - 1.29) for women in the second 
      quintile of intake, 0.60 (95% CI, 0.40 - 0.89) for the third quintile, 0.57 (95% 
      CI, 0.38 - 0.86) for fourth quintile and 0.74 (95% CI, 0.50 - 1.10) for the
      highest quintile (Ptrend = 0.003). The association was stronger for dietary zinc 
      (HR 0.63, 95% CI, 0.43 - 0.93, comparing extreme quintiles) than for zinc intake 
      from supplements. Neither dietary nor supplemental zinc modified risk of UC.
      CONCLUSIONS: In two large prospective cohorts of women, intake of zinc was
      inversely associated with risk of CD but not UC.

TI  - Review article: insights into colonic protein fermentation, its modulation and
      potential health implications.
PG  - 181-96
LID - 10.1111/apt.13456 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Beneficial effects of carbohydrate fermentation on gastrointestinal
      health are well established. Conversely, protein fermentation generates harmful
      metabolites but their relevance to gastrointestinal health is poorly understood. 
      AIM: To review the effects of increased protein fermentation on biomarkers of
      colonic health, factors influencing fermentative activity and potential for
      dietary modulation to minimise detrimental effects. METHODS: A literature search 
      was performed in PubMed, Medline, EMBASE and Google scholar for clinical and
      pre-clinical studies using search terms - 'dietary protein', 'fermentation',
      'putrefaction', 'phenols', 'sulphide', 'branched-chain fatty acid', 'carbohydrate
      fermentation', 'gastrointestinal'. RESULTS: High protein, reduced carbohydrate
      diets alter the colonic microbiome, favouring a potentially pathogenic and
      pro-inflammatory microbiota profile, decreased short-chain fatty acid production 
      and increased ammonia, phenols and hydrogen sulphide concentrations. These
      metabolites largely compromise the colonic epithelium structure, causing mucosal 
      inflammation but may also directly modulate the enteric nervous system and
      intestinal motility. Increased protein fermentation as a result of a high-protein
      intake can be attenuated by addition of oligosaccharides, resistant starch and
      nonstarch polysaccharides and a reduction in total protein or specifically,
      aromatic and sulphur-containing amino acids. These factors may have clinical
      importance as novel therapeutic approaches to problems, in which protein
      fermentation may be implicated, such as malodorous flatus, irritable bowel
      syndrome, ulcerative colitis and prevention of colorectal cancer. CONCLUSIONS:
      The direct clinical relevance of excessive protein fermentation in the
      pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome, malodorous flatus and ulcerative
      colitis are underexplored. Manipulating dietary carbohydrate and protein intake
      have potential therapeutic applications in such settings and warrant further
      clinical studies.

TI  - Sodium chloride inhibits the suppressive function of FOXP3+ regulatory T cells.
PG  - 4212-22
LID - 10.1172/JCI81151 [doi]
LID - 81151 [pii]
AB  - FOXP3+ Tregs are central for the maintenance of self-tolerance and can be
      defective in autoimmunity. In multiple sclerosis and type-1 diabetes,
      dysfunctional self-tolerance is partially mediated by a population of
      IFNgamma-secreting Tregs. It was previously reported that increased NaCl
      concentrations promote the induction of proinflammatory Th17 cells and that
      high-salt diets exacerbate experimental models of autoimmunity. Here, we have
      shown that increasing NaCl, either in vitro or in murine models via diet,
      markedly impairs Treg function. NaCl increased IFNgamma secretion in Tregs, and
      reducing IFNgamma - either by neutralization with anti-IFNgamma antibodies or
      shRNA-mediated knockdown - restored suppressive activity in Tregs. The heightened
      IFNgamma secretion and loss of Treg function were mediated by the
      serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK1). A high-salt diet also impaired
      human Treg function and was associated with the induction of IFNgamma-secreting
      Tregs in a xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease model and in adoptive transfer
      models of experimental colitis. Our results demonstrate a putative role for an
      environmental factor that promotes autoimmunity by inducing proinflammatory
      responses in CD4 effector cells and Treg pathways.

      and unclassified IBD, continues to cause significant morbidity. While its
      incidence is increasing, no clear etiology and no cure have yet been discovered. 
      Recent findings suggest that IBD may have a multifactorial etiology, where
      complex interactions between genetics, epigenetics, environmental factors
      (including diet but also infections, antibiotics, and sanitation), and host
      immune system lead to abnormal immune responses and chronic inflammation. Over
      the past years, the role of altered gut microbiota (in both composition and
      function) in IBD pathogenesis has emerged as an outstanding area of interest.
      According to new findings, gut dysbiosis may appear as a key element in
      initiation of inflammation in IBD and its complications. Moreover, complex
      metagenomic studies provide possibilities to distinguish between IBD types and
      appreciate severity and prognosis of the disease, as well as response to therapy.
      This review provides an updated knowledge of recent findings linking altered
      bacterial composition and functions, viruses, and fungi to IBD pathogenesis. It
      also highlights the complex genetic, epigenetic, immune, and microbial
      interactions in relation to environmental factors (including diet). We overview
      the actual options to manipulate the altered microbiota, such as modified diet,
      probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, antibiotics, and fecal transplantation.
      Future possible therapies are also included. Targeting altered microbiota could
      be the next therapeutic personalized approach, but more research and
      well-designed comparative prospective studies are required to formulate adequate 
      directions for prevention and therapy.

AB  - Obesity, a worldwide epidemic, is a major risk factor for the development of
      metabolic syndrome (MetS) including diabetes and associated health complications.
      Recent studies indicate that chronic low-grade inflammation (CLGI) plays a key
      role in metabolic deterioration in the obese population. Previously, we reported 
      that Jak3 was essential for mucosal differentiation and enhanced colonic barrier 
      functions and its loss in mice resulted in basal CLGI and predisposition to DSS
      induced colitis. Since CLGI is associated with diabetes, obesity, and metabolic
      syndrome, present studies determined the role of Jak3 in development of such
      conditions. Our data show that loss of Jak3 resulted in increased body weight,
      basal systemic CLGI, compromised glycemic homeostasis, hyperinsulinemia, and
      early symptoms of liver steatosis. Lack of Jak3 also resulted in exaggerated
      symptoms of metabolic syndrome by western high-fat diet. Mechanistically, Jak3
      was essential for reduced expression and activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs)
      in murine intestinal mucosa and human intestinal epithelial cells where Jak3
      interacted with and activated p85, the regulatory subunit of the PI3K, through
      tyrosine phosphorylation of adapter protein insulin receptor substrate (IRS1).
      These interactions resulted in activation of PI3K-Akt axis, which was essential
      for reduced TLR expression and TLR associated NFkappaB activation. Collectively, 
      these results demonstrate the essential role of Jak3 in promoting mucosal
      tolerance through suppressed expression and limiting activation of TLRs thereby
      preventing intestinal and systemic CLGI and associated obesity and MetS.

AB  - Inflammation is a protective process for life that aims to restore body
      homeostasis by targeting the injury and by inducing repair mechanisms. This
      process can also become excessive and lead to chronic inflammation and organ
      fibrosis. Polyunsaturated fatty acids play a key role in inflammatory processes
      and their resolution. Indeed, numerous lipid mediators derived from n-3 or n-6
      PUFA such as eicosanoids, endocannabinoids, or proresolving lipids are able to
      target transcription factors to modulate gene expression. One other important
      action mechanism is by modification of cell membrane composition. The purpose of 
      the present review is to describe the potential mechanisms by which PUFA
      influence inflammatory processes. To illustrate this purpose, we focused on the
      interactions between PUFA and intestinal inflammation as an integrative example.

TI  - Dietary Practices and Beliefs in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
PG  - 164-70
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000585 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: An epidemiological association implicating diet in IBD risk or
      protection is widely accepted. Patients with IBD often make links to diet, but
      there is a dearth of literature exploring dietary perceptions and practices in
      this population. Our objective was to evaluate dietary beliefs and behaviors in
      IBD patients. METHODS: We developed a questionnaire assessing demographics,
      dietary beliefs and habits in IBD patients. This was prospectively administered
      to 400 consecutive patients attending our IBD clinics. RESULTS: Mean patient age 
      was 48.4 years; 55% were female, 88% white, 39% had Crohn's disease and 51% had
      ulcerative colitis. Around 48% felt that diet could be the initiating factor in
      IBD and 57% felt it could trigger a flare. Worsening symptoms with certain foods 
      was reported by 60%. About 66% deprived themselves of their favorite foods in
      order to prevent relapse. Three-fourth of patients believed that IBD affects
      appetite, more so during a relapse. Nearly half had never received any formal
      dietary advice, and two-thirds requested for further dietary advice. After
      adjusting for other predictors, the IBD subtype and ethnicity of the patients
      remained as significant factors for influencing beliefs held by patients.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that patients hold beliefs pertaining to the role
      of diet in IBD, with a high level of consistency around key perceived triggers.
      Whether all the symptoms reported are due to active inflammation cannot be
      ascertained, but the potential exists for dietary components triggering active
      disease and perpetuating gut injury, impacting on quality of life and health care
      costs.

AB  - Supplementation with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) may be
      beneficial for patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). In this study we 
      analyzed the pharmacokinetic profile of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), as the free 
      fatty acid (FFA), in an enteric-coated preparation, in 10 ulcerative colitis (UC)
      and 10 Crohn's disease (CD) patients and 15 healthy volunteers (HV). Subjects
      received 2 g daily of EPA-FFA for 8 weeks. Plasma phospholipid and red blood cell
      (RBC) membrane fatty acid content were measured by gas chromatography-mass
      spectrometry. There was a rapid incorporation of EPA into plasma phospholipids by
      2 weeks and a slower, but highly consistent, incorporation into RBC membranes (4%
      total fatty acid content; coefficient of variation 10-16%). There was a
      concomitant reduction in relative n-6 PUFA content. Elongation and desaturation
      of EPA into docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) via docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) were
      apparent and DHA content also increased in membranes. EPA-FFA is well tolerated
      and no difference in the pharmacokinetic profile of n-3 PUFA incorporation was
      detected between IBD patients and HV. Our data support the concept that EPA can
      be considered the "universal donor" with respect to key n-3 PUFAs and that this
      enteric-coated formulation allows long term treatment with a high level of
      compliance.

TI  - Th17 response and autophagy--main pathways implicated in the development of
      inflammatory bowel disease by genome-wide association studies.
PG  - 559-65
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an entity that mainly includes ulcerative
      colitis (UC) and Crohn s disease (CD). Improved health care, diet changes, and
      higher industrialization are associated with an increase in IBD prevalence. This 
      supports the central role of environmental factors in the pathology of this
      disease. However, IBD also shows a relevant genetic component as shown by high
      heritability. Classic genetic studies showed relevant associations between IBD
      susceptibility and genes involved in the immune response. This is consistent with
      prior theories about IBD development. According to these, contact of the immune
      system with a high number of harmless antigens from the diet and the bacterial
      flora should originate tolerance while preserving response against pathogens.
      Failure to achieve this balance may originate the typical inflammatory response
      associated with IBD. Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have
      confirmed the implication of the immune system, particularly the Th17 immune
      response, previously associated to other autoimmune diseases, and of autophagy.
      In this paper, the mechanisms involved in these two relevant pathways and their
      potential role in the pathogenesis of IBD are reviewed.

AB  - The incidence of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn
      disease and ulcerative colitis, has risen alarmingly in the Western and
      developing world in recent decades. Epidemiologic (including monozygotic twin and
      migrant) studies highlight the substantial role of environment and nutrition in
      IBD etiology. Here we review the literature supporting the developmental and
      environmental origins hypothesis of IBD. We also provide a detailed exploration
      of how the human microbiome and epigenome (primarily through DNA methylation) may
      be important elements in the developmental origins of IBD in both children and
      adults.

TI  - Single-Incision Total Proctocolectomy and Ileal Pouch Anal Anastomosis in
      Pediatric Patients: Lessons Learned.
PG  - 782-5
LID - 10.1089/lap.2014.0368 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Total proctocolectomy (TPC) and ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA)
      have become the standard of care for patients with ulcerative colitis refractory 
      to medical management. The purpose of our study is to show our single-site
      approach and to identify maneuvers that improve efficiency. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent single-site
      three-stage TPC-IPAA for ulcerative colitis at our institution. Primary outcomes 
      included operative time, conversion from single site to standard laparoscopy,
      time to oral intake and stoma function, postoperative complications, and length
      of stay. The GelPOINT() Advanced Access Platform (Applied Medical, Santa
      Margarita, CA) was used. RESULTS: Eight patients were identified who had
      undergone single-site surgery with the GelPOINT platform. Six of the 8 patients
      underwent the first stage, total abdominal colectomy (TAC), and all 8 underwent
      the second stage (proctectomy/IPAA). The mean operating time for TAC was 242 +/- 
      32 minutes. The mean time until tolerance of clear diet was 1.2 +/- 0.4 days, and
      time until tolerance of regular diet was 3.3 +/- 1.2 days. The mean time to stoma
      function was 1.5 +/- 0.55 days, and that for postoperative opioid use was 4.0 +/-
      1.3 days. The median length of stay was 5 days (range, 3-10 days). There was one 
      postoperative complication. The mean operating time for the proctectomy/IPAA was 
      283 +/- 50 minutes. The mean time until tolerance of clear diet was 1.0 +/- 0.5
      days, and time until tolerance of regular diet was 3.3 +/- 1.1 days. The mean
      time to stoma function was 1.6 days +/- 0.52 days, and that for postoperative
      opioid use was 3.3 +/- 1.4 days. Median length of stay was 4 days (range, 3-9
      days). There was one postoperative complication. Technical adaptations that
      included extracorporeal mesenteric division, rectal eversion, and rotation of the
      GelPOINT device served to improve the ease and efficiency of the procedure.
      CONCLUSIONS: Single-site TPC-IPAA is both feasible and safe. Incorporation of
      adapted technical maneuvers can increase efficiency.

TI  - PancreApp: An Innovative Approach to Computational Individualization of
      Nutritional Therapy in Chronic Gastrointestinal Disorders.
PG  - 325-8
AB  - Medical nutrition therapy has a pivotal role in the management of chronic
      gastrointestinal disorders, like chronic pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel
      diseases (Lesniowski-Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) or irritable bowel
      syndrome. The aim of this study is to develop, deploy and evaluate an interactive
      application for Windows and Android operating systems, which could serve as a
      digital diet diary and as an analysis and a prediction tool both for the patient 
      and the doctor. The software is gathering details about patients' diet and
      associated fettle in order to estimate fettle change after future meals,
      specifically for an individual patient. In this paper we have described the
      process of idea development and application design, feasibility assessment using 
      a phone survey, a preliminary evaluation on 6 healthy individuals and early
      results of a clinical trial, which is still an ongoing study. Results suggest
      that applied approximative approach (Shepard's method of 6-dimensional metric
      interpolation) has a potential to predict the fettle accurately; as shown in
      leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diet may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's
      disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC); yet, there are few prospective studies 
      of dietary factors. None have examined the association between adolescent diet
      and risk of inflammatory bowel diseases (CD and UC). METHODS: This study included
      women enrolled in Nurses' Health Study II who completed a validated high school
      dietary questionnaire in 1998. We examined the effect of dietary patterns
      (prudent or Western diet) and individual components of each patterns. We
      documented incident cases of CD and UC through 2011 based on physician review of 
      medical records and used Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for
      confounders to estimate hazard ratios and confidence intervals for CD and UC.
      RESULTS: Over 763,229 person-years of follow-up, we identified 70 incident cases 
      of CD and 103 cases of UC. Compared with women in the lowest quartile of a
      prudent diet score (characterized by greater intake of fruits, vegetables, and
      fish), women in the highest quartile had a 53% lower risk of CD (hazard ratio,
      0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.23-0.98; P trend = 0.04). Specifically, greater 
      intake of fish (P trend = 0.01) and fiber (P trend = 0.06) were associated with
      lower risk of CD. In contrast, Western diet score was not associated with risk of
      CD. Neither dietary patterns nor individual food or nutrient groups was
      associated with UC. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent diet is associated with risk of CD,
      but not UC, offering insights into disease pathogenesis.

TI  - Systematic review: bile acids and intestinal inflammation-luminal aggressors or
      regulators of mucosal defence?
PG  - 802-17
LID - 10.1111/apt.13333 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), comprising Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic conditions attributed to an aberrant immune 
      response to luminal triggers. Recently, published work suggests a pathogenic role
      for bile acids in this context. AIM: To perform a systematic review of studies
      investigating the role of bile acids in intestinal inflammation and present
      potentially relevant clinical implications. METHODS: Pubmed search for English
      language articles published up to May 2015. Terms used were: 'bile', 'bile acid',
      'barrier', 'small bowel injury', 'Crohn's' and 'colitis'. RESULTS: Experimental
      studies support a variable role for bile acids in intestinal barrier
      homoeostasis. This may be attributed to different physicochemical properties,
      variable effects on epithelia and immune cells via bile acids-specific receptors,
      or through a cross-talk with the gut microbiome. A reduction in the bile acids
      pool, with lower concentrations of secondary forms, has been recognised for some 
      time in Crohn's disease and associated to ileal dysfunction and bile acids
      malabsorption. Recent work suggests that these changes, including an increase in 
      sulphated forms, are related to inflammatory activity in both Crohn's disease and
      UC. The detrimental effects of 'western diet' elements such as emulsifiers and
      fat, which have been implicated in the development of the current IBD and obesity
      epidemics, may also be bile acid-mediated. CONCLUSIONS: Although there are only a
      few observational clinical studies to support an interaction, in vivo human and
      animal studies support an association between bile acids metabolism, the gut
      microbiome and intestinal inflammation. This may well prove to have significant
      diagnostic and therapeutic implications.

TI  - Dietary intake of inulin-type fructans in active and inactive Crohn's disease and
      healthy controls: a case-control study.
PG  - 1024-31
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv136 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Prebiotic inulin-type fructans are widely consumed in the
      diet and may have contrasting effects in Crohn's disease by stimulating gut
      microbiota and/or by generating functional gastrointestinal symptoms. The aim of 
      this study was to measure fructan and oligofructose intakes in patients with
      active and inactive Crohn's disease compared with healthy controls. METHODS:
      Patients with active Crohn's disease (n = 98), inactive Crohn's (n = 99) and
      healthy controls (n = 106) were recruited to a case-control study. Dietary intake
      of inulin-type fructans was measured using a specific food frequency
      questionnaire and was compared between the three groups and between patients with
      different disease phenotypes (Montreal classification). Associations between
      intakes and disease activity (Harvey-Bradshaw Index, HBI) were also undertaken.
      RESULTS: Patients with active Crohn's disease had lower fructan intakes (median
      2.9 g/d, interquartile range [IQR] 1.8) than those with inactive Crohn's (3.6
      g/d, 2.1, p = 0.036) or controls (3.9 g/d, 2.1, p = 0.003) and lower
      oligofructose intakes (2.8 g/d, 1.8) than those with inactive Crohn's (3.5 g/d,
      2.2, p = 0.048) or controls (3.8 g/d, 2.1, p = 0.003). There were no differences 
      in intakes related to disease site or behaviour. There were negative correlations
      between HBI well-being score and fructan intake (rho = -0.154, p = 0.03) and
      oligofructose intake (rho = -0.156, p = 0.028) and for the HBI abdominal pain
      score and fructan (rho = -0.164, p = 0.021) and oligofructose intake (rho =
      -0.157, p = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with active Crohn's disease consume
      lower quantities of fructans and oligofructose than their inactive counterparts
      and healthy controls. The impact of lower intakes of prebiotic fructans on gut
      microbiota is unknown and warrants further research.

AB  - The gastrointestinal (GI) tract provides an intriguing organ for considering the 
      eosinophil's role in health and disease. The normal GI tract, except for the
      esophagus, is populated by eosinophils that are present throughout the mucosa,
      raising the possibility that eosinophils participate in innate mechanisms of
      defense. However, data from clinical studies associates increased numbers of
      eosinophils with inflammatory GI diseases, prompting concerns that eosinophils
      may have a deleterious effect on the gut. We present clinical features of 4
      disease processes that have been associated with eosinophilia and suggest areas
      requiring investigation as to their clinical significance and scientific
      relevance.

      Determined by Colonoscopy.
PG  - 478-81
LID - 07.2015/JCPSP.478481 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To document the quality of colonoscopy practice and the pattern of
      colonic disease including polyp detection rate at Shifa International Hospital,
      Islamabad, Pakistan. STUDY DESIGN: An observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF 
      STUDY: Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad, Pakistan, from May 2013 to June
      2014. METHODOLOGY: This retrospective study recorded demographics of patients,
      indications and quality indices of 505 colonoscopies performed during the study
      period. Preparation was done with low residue diet and polyethylene glycol.
      Conscious sedation was generally used. Quality indices studied were compared with
      guideline standard. RESULTS: Out of 505 colonoscopy patients, 305 were males and 
      200 were females. The indications for colonoscopic examination were lower
      gastrointestinal bleeding (26.5%, n=134), screening for colorectal cancer (14.1%,
      n=71), chronic diarrhea (12.9%, n=65), abdominal pain (10.9%, n=55), anemia
      (9.1%, n=46), constipation (7.3%, n=37), hematochezia and diarrhea (6.3%, n=32), 
      altered bowel habits (5.1%, n=26), weight loss (3.6%, n=18), colonic thickening
      on CT scan (3.0%, n=15) and others (1.2%, n=6). Bowel preparation was adequate
      (in 92%, n=465) cases. Cecal intubation rate was 88.71% (n=448). Endoscopic
      diagnoses were hemorrhoids (36.2%, n=183), normal (22%, n=111), polyps (11.3%,
      n=57), ulcerative colitis (8.7%, n=44), cancer (4%, n=20), diverticulosis (3.4%, 
      n=17), infective colitis (2.6%, n=13), intestinal TB (2.6%, n=13), non-specific
      colitis (2.2%, n=11), proctitis (1.8%, n=9) and others (5.3%, n=27). CONCLUSION: 
      There is room for improvement in quality of colonoscopy, cecal intubation rate is
      slightly below the recommended standard and polyp detection rate is quite low
      however, it is not clear if the low rate of polyp detection is due to missed
      lesions or low population incidence. Time to reach caecum and withdrawal time
      should clearly be documented in the notes which can help to evaluate quality of
      the procedure in a better way.

TI  - The Roles of Inflammation, Nutrient Availability and the Commensal Microbiota in 
      Enteric Pathogen Infection.
LID - 10.1128/microbiolspec.MBP-0008-2014 [doi]
AB  - The healthy human intestine is colonized by as many as 1014 bacteria belonging to
      more than 500 different species forming a microbial ecosystem of unsurpassed
      diversity, termed the microbiota. The microbiota's various bacterial members
      engage in a physiological network of cooperation and competition within several
      layers of complexity. Within the last 10 years, technological progress in the
      field of next-generation sequencing technologies has tremendously advanced our
      understanding of the wide variety of physiological and pathological processes
      that are influenced by the commensal microbiota (1, 2). An increasing number of
      human disease conditions, such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), type 2
      diabetes, obesity, allergies and colorectal cancer are linked with altered
      microbiota composition (3). Moreover, a clearer picture is emerging of the
      composition of the human microbiota in healthy individuals, its variability over 
      time and between different persons and how the microbiota is shaped by
      environmental factors (i.e., diet) and the host's genetic background (4). A
      general feature of a normal, healthy gut microbiota can generate conditions in
      the gut that disfavor colonization of enteric pathogens. This is termed
      colonization-resistance (CR). Upon disturbance of the microbiota, CR can be
      transiently disrupted, and pathogens can gain the opportunity to grow to high
      levels. This disruption can be caused by exposure to antibiotics (5, 6), changes 
      in diet (7, 8), application of probiotics and drugs (9), and a variety of
      diseases (3). Breakdown of CR can boost colonization by intrinsic pathogens or
      increase susceptibility to infections (10). One consequence of pathogen expansion
      is the triggering of inflammatory host responses and pathogen-mediated disease.
      Interestingly, human enteric pathogens are part of a small group of bacterial
      families that belong to the Proteobacteria: the Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli,
      Yersinia spp., Salmonella spp., Shigella spp.), the Vibrionaceae (Vibrio
      cholerae) and the Campylobacteriaceae (Campylobacter spp.). In general, members
      of these families (be it commensals or pathogens) only constitute a minority of
      the intestinal microbiota. However, proteobacterial "blooms" are a characteristic
      trait of an abnormal microbiota such as in the course of antibiotic therapy,
      dietary changes or inflammation (11). It has become clear that the gut microbiota
      not only plays a major role in priming and regulating mucosal and systemic
      immunity, but that the immune system also contributes to host control over
      microbiota composition. These two ways of mutual communication between the
      microbiota and the immune system were coined as "outside-in" and "inside-out,"
      respectively (12). The significance of those interactions for human health is
      particularly evident in Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC). The
      symptoms of these recurrent, chronic types of gut inflammation are caused by an
      excessive immune response against one's own commensal microbiota (13). It is
      assumed that deregulated immune responses can be caused by a genetic
      predisposition, leading to, for example, the impairment of intestinal barrier
      function or disruption of mucosal T-cell homeostasis. In CD or UC patients, an
      abnormally composed microbiota, referred to as "dysbiosis," is commonly observed 
      (discussed later). This is often characterized by an increased relative abundance
      of facultative anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Enterobacteriaeceae, Bacilli) and, at
      the same time, depletion of obligate anaerobic bacteria of the classes
      Bacteroidia and Clostridia. So far, it is unclear whether dysbiosis is a cause or
      a consequence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In fact, both scenarios are
      equally conceivable. Recent work suggests that inflammatory immune responses in
      the gut (both IBD and pathogen-induced) can alter the gut luminal milieu in a way
      that favors dysbiosis (14). In this chapter, I present a survey on our current
      state of understanding of the characteristics and mechanisms underlying gut
      inflammation-associated dysbiosis. The role of dysbiosis in enteric infections
      and human IBD is discussed. In addition, I will focus on competition of enteric
      pathogens and the gut microbiota in the inflamed gut and the role of dysbiotic
      microbiota alterations (e.g., "Enterobacterial blooms" (11)) for the evolution of
      pathogenicity.

AB  - Several epidemiological investigations have been conducted to evaluate the
      relationship between dietary fiber intake and inflammatory bowel diseases, but
      the results are inconsistent. This meta-analysis was performed to quantitatively 
      summarize the evidence from observational studies. PubMed, Embase, and Web of
      Knowledge were searched for relevant articles published up to November 2014. The 
      combined relative risks were calculated with the fixed- or random-effects model. 
      Dose-response relationship was assessed using restricted cubic spline model. We
      hypothesized that the meta-analysis could yield a summary effect, which would
      indicate that dietary fiber intake could decrease the risk of ulcerative colitis 
      and Crohn disease (CD). Overall, 8 articles involving 2 cohort studies, 1 nested 
      case-control study, and 5 case-control studies were finally included in this
      study. The pooled relative risks with 95% confidence intervals of ulcerative
      colitis and CD for the highest vs lowest categories of dietary fiber intake were 
      0.80 (0.64-1.00) and 0.44 (0.29-0.69), respectively. A linear dose-response
      relationship was found between dietary fiber and CD risk, and the risk of CD
      decreased by 13% (P < .05) for every 10 g/d increment in fiber intake. The
      results from this meta-analysis indicated that the intake of dietary fiber was
      significantly associated with a decreased risk of inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Intestinal mucosal barrier dysfunction participates in the progress of
      nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
PG  - 3648-58
AB  - Intestinal mucosal barrier dysfunction is closely related to liver diseases,
      which implies impaired gut-liver axis may play a role in the pathogenesis of
      NAFLD. In our study, rats were divided into three groups: normal chow diet (NCD) 
      group, high-fat diet (HFD) group and TNBS-induced colitis with high-fat diet
      (C-HFD) group. Liver tissues were obtained for histological observation and
      TNF-alpha, IL-6 mRNA determination and blood samples were collected for liver
      enzymes and LPS analysis. Ultrastructural changes of jejuna epithelium, SIBO and 
      amounts of CD103(+)MHCII(+)DCs and CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+)T-regs in terms of
      percentage in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) were observed by electron microscope, 
      bacterial cultivation and flow cytometry, respectively. The results demonstrated 
      the pathological characteristics accorded with nonalcoholic simple fatty liver
      (NAFL) and NASH in HFD group by week 8 and 12, respectively. Besides, the degree 
      of hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis was more severe in C-HFD group compared 
      with HFD-group at the same time point. NAFLD activity score (NAS), liver enzymes,
      concentration of LPS and mRNA expressions of TNF-alpha, IL-6 were higher
      significantly in C-HFD group compared with HFD and NCD group at week 4, 8 and 12,
      respectively. In HFD group, epithelium microvilli atrophy, disruptive tight
      junctions and SIBO were present, and these changes were more severe in NASH
      compared with NAFL. The percentage of CD103+MHCII+DCs and CD4+CD25+FoxP3+T-regs
      decreased significantly in NAFL and NASH compared with NCD group. Our conclusion 
      was that gut-liver axis was impaired in NAFLD, which played crucial role in the
      pathogenesis of NAFLD.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which primarily includes Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis, involves chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. 
      The mechanisms of IBD pathogenesis are not well understood at this time, but
      likely involve an interaction between genetic, gut microbial, immune, and
      environmental factors. Emerging epidemiologic studies have suggested a
      relationship between specific dietary nutrients as an environmental factor and
      IBD risk. Clinical trials have also shown oral diets to have variable efficacy in
      affecting clinical outcomes for IBD. This review discusses the key studies that
      evaluated the use of various oral diets as well as nutrition support in the
      management of IBD.

TI  - Toward enteral nutrition for the treatment of pediatric Crohn disease in Canada: 
      a workshop to identify barriers and enablers.
PG  - 351-6
LID - 16819 [pii]
AB  - The treatment armamentarium in pediatric Crohn disease (CD) is very similar to
      adult-onset CD with the notable exception of the use of exclusive enteral
      nutrition (EEN [the administration of a liquid formula diet while excluding
      normal diet]), which is used more frequently by pediatric gastroenterologists to 
      induce remission. In pediatric CD, EEN is now recommended by the pediatric
      committee of the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation and the European
      Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition as a
      first-choice agent to induce remission, with remission rates in pediatric studies
      consistently >75%. To chart and address enablers and barriers of use of EEN in
      Canada, a workshop was held in September 2014 in Toronto (Ontario), inviting
      pediatric gastroenterologists, nurses and dietitians from most Canadian pediatric
      IBD centres as well as international faculty from the United States and Europe
      with particular research and clinical expertise in the dietary management of
      pediatric CD. Workshop participants ranked the exclusivity of enteral nutrition; 
      the health care resources; and cost implications as the top three barriers to its
      use. Conversely, key enablers mentioned included: standardization and sharing of 
      protocols for use of enteral nutrition; ensuring sufficient dietetic resources;
      and reducing the cost of EEN to the family (including advocacy for reimbursement 
      by provincial ministries of health and private insurance companies). Herein, the 
      authors report on the discussions during this workshop and list strategies to
      enhance the use of EEN as a treatment option in the treatment of pediatric CD in 
      Canada.

AB  - Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders are a heterogeneous group of disorders
      characterized by no specific digestive symptoms associated with dense
      eosinophilic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract in the absence of known
      causes for such tissue eosinophilia. Among these diseases, eosinophilic
      gastroenteritis (EGE) and colitis (EC) are less common than esophagitis, but
      their incidence and prevalence have been increasing over the past decade due in
      part to increased disease recognition. The exact pathophysiology is not clear:
      EGE and EC are immune-mediated diseases implicating adaptive T-helper cell type 2
      immunity. According to the site of eosinophilic infiltration, there is a wide
      spectrum of digestive symptoms ranging from food refusal, nausea, vomiting,
      abdominal pain, weight loss, gastrointestinal bleeding (anemia), protein loosing 
      enteropathy, ascites, bowel obstruction or perforation for EGE and diarrhea +/-
      bleeding for CE. Endoscopic lesions are not specific: friability, erythematous
      mucosa with superficial erosions, or ulceration is often observed.
      Histologically, markedly increased numbers of mucosal eosinophils are seen in
      biopsy specimens. However, no standards for the diagnosis of EGE or CE exist and 
      few findings support the diagnosis: intraepithelial eosinophils, eosinophil crypt
      abscesses, and eosinophils in muscularis mucosa and/or submucosa. Other organs
      are not involved. The other causes of tissue eosinophilia (infections,
      inflammatory bowel diseases) should be excluded. Food allergy appears to play a
      central role in driving inflammation in EGE and CE, as evidenced by symptomatic
      improvement with initiation of food exclusion or elemental diets. Dietary
      treatment should be the first therapeutic option in children. If the elimination 
      diet fails, corticosteroids are currently the best characterized treatment but
      appropriate duration is unknown and relapses are frequent. In severe forms,
      immunomodulators or biologic agents (anti-IL5, anti-IgE, or anti-TNFa) can
      potentially play a role in the treatment of EGE and CE.

TI  - Selenium and inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - G71-7
LID - 10.1152/ajpgi.00379.2014 [doi]
AB  - Dietary intake of the micronutrient selenium is essential for normal immune
      functions. Selenium is cotranslationally incorporated as the 21st amino acid,
      selenocysteine, into selenoproteins that function to modulate pathways involved
      in inflammation. Epidemiological studies have suggested an inverse association
      between selenium levels and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes
      Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis that can potentially progress to colon
      cancer. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here we
      summarize the current literature on the pathophysiology of IBD, which is
      multifactorial in origin with unknown etiology. We have focused on a few
      selenoproteins that mediate gastrointestinal inflammation and activate the host
      immune response, wherein macrophages play a pivotal role. Changes in cellular
      oxidative state coupled with altered expression of selenoproteins in macrophages 
      drive the switch from a proinflammatory phenotype to an anti-inflammatory
      phenotype to efficiently resolve inflammation in the gut and restore epithelial
      barrier integrity. Such a phenotypic plasticity is accompanied by changes in
      cytokines, chemokines, and bioactive metabolites, including eicosanoids that not 
      only mitigate inflammation but also partake in restoring gut homeostasis through 
      diverse pathways involving differential regulation of transcription factors such 
      as nuclear factor-kappaB and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma.
      The role of the intestinal microbiome in modulating inflammation and aiding in
      selenium-dependent resolution of gut injury is highlighted to provide novel
      insights into the beneficial effects of selenium in IBD.

AB  - The composite human gut microbiomes of Western populations have changed over the 
      past century, brought on by new environmental triggers that often have a negative
      impact on human health. Diets high in saturated fats and refined sugars and low
      in fiber are leading candidates for these events and for triggering the increased
      prevalence of immune-mediated diseases like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Our
      studies have shown that consumption of a 'Western' diet high in saturated
      (milk-derived) fat (MF) or n-6 polyunsaturated (safflower oil) fat have similar
      effects on the structure of the colonic microbiome of wild-type and IL- 10(-/-)
      mice, characterized by increased Bacteroidetes and decreased Firmicutes. However,
      the MF diet uniquely promotes the expansion of an immunogenic sulfite-reducing
      pathobiont, Bilophila wadsworthia, a member of the Deltaproteobacteria and minor 
      component of the gut microbiome. This bacterial bloom results from a MF
      diet-induced shift in hepatic conjugation of bile acids, from glycocholic to
      taurocholic (TC) acid, which is important for solubilizing the more hydrophobic
      MF diet. However, it is also responsible for delivery of taurine-derived sulfur
      to the distal bowel, promoting the assemblage of bile-tolerant microbes such as
      B. wadsworthia. The bloom of this species promotes a Th1-mediated immune response
      and the development of colitis in IL-10(-/-) mice. A similar bloom of B.
      wadsworthia is seen when IL-10(-/-) mice are fed a low-fat diet supplemented with
      TC. B. wadsworthia colonization of monoassociated germ-free IL-10(-/-) mice was
      dependent on the host consuming either a high-saturated MF diet or the gavage
      with TC. Together, these data provide a plausible explanation for the link
      between diseases such as IBD and dietary-mediated selection of gut microbial
      pathobionts in genetically susceptible hosts. With this knowledge, it may be
      possible to mitigate the bloom of these types of pathobionts by modifying the
      conjugation states of bile acids.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fiber definition includes all those carbohydrates which are not
      digested nor absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract allowing them to reach 
      the colon with no previous processing. Traditionally fiber has been classified
      according to their solubility into soluble and insoluble and different
      physiological properties have been defined for each type. The physiologic role of
      the fiber intake has been studied in diabetes, dyslipidemia or obesity. Fiber
      intake has also demonstrated to be beneficial in the prevention of many
      neoplastic diseases like colorectal cancer. It s also known that fiber plays an
      important role in the faecal excretion of nitrogen. AIM: To evaluate the current 
      evidence that fiber intake plays in the management and prevention of several
      different diseases, being able to determine, if possible, the most recommended
      fiber type for each clinical condition. METHODS: A non-systematic review by
      searching the Medline and Pubmed was made and studies which met the inclusion
      criteria were identified and selected for analysis. RESULTS: Different fiber
      types can be useful for the treatment of several gastrointestinal diseases like
      constipation, diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis remission or
      short bowel syndrome. Patients diagnosed with diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia, 
      hypertension and other cardiometabolic diseases can get a clinical improvement
      with soluble fiber intake. Dietary fiber has demonstrated to play a role in the
      prevention of colorrectal cancer and other neoplastic diseases. Patients with
      hepatic encephalopathy or chronic kidney disease will also benefit from
      fermentable fiber intake. DISCUSSION: Fiber plays an important role in the
      prevention and treatment of many clinical conditions. However further
      investigations are needed to establish specific fiber intake recommendations.

PG  - 69-73
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000767 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The dietary protein proctocolitis, also known as allergic
      proctocolitis (AP), is characterized by the presence of mucoid, frothy, and
      bloody stools in an otherwise healthy infant. The aim of this study was to
      describe a group of children with AP, diagnosed according to the
      criterion-standard method, food challenge to provide clinicians with more
      information on typical presentation, and an overview on nutritional management
      strategies and prognosis. METHODS: We collected data on infants with AP in our
      allergy and gastroenterology outpatient clinics. Any other conditions that may
      cause bloody diarrhea were ruled out. Skin prick tests and atopy patch tests were
      performed for diagnosis, and patients were studied for resolution. To the
      patients whose rectal bleeding did not recover with oligoantigenic maternal diet 
      in addition to amino acid-based formula, endoscopic evaluation was performed to
      confirm the diagnosis and to exclude other reasons of rectal bleeding. RESULTS:
      Sixty patients were diagnosed as having AP. The age of onset was 1.7 +/- 1.32
      months. All of the patients were triggered by milk, 6.6% with milk and egg, 3.3% 
      with milk and chicken, 1.7% with milk and wheat, 1.7% with milk and potato, and
      3.3% had multiple food allergy. 53.3% (n = 32) acquired tolerance by age 1, 25.0%
      (n = 15) by 2 years, 5% (n = 3) by 3, and 1.7% (n = 1) by 4 years. CONCLUSIONS:
      Milk was a triggering factor for all of the patients. Resolution of AP is usually
      within 1 year but symptoms of some patients may continue even longer. An
      extension of the follow-up period is required according to our study.

TI  - Food Intolerance: Immune Activation Through Diet-associated Stimuli in Chronic
      Disease.
PG  - 42-52
AB  - The immune response is a very complex interplay of specific and nonspecific
      branches that have evolved to distinguish between nondangerous and dangerous or
      nontolerated factors. In the past, research has focused on the specific immune
      system much more than the host's innate defense. Studies have shown that a key
      component of the immune response involves activation of the inflammasome. A
      direct relationship between the presence of the inflammasome and the onset of
      disease has already been characterized for a variety of chronic and food-related 
      diseases, including arthrosclerosis, metabolic syndrome, and chronic bowel
      diseases, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The leukocyte
      activation (ALCAT test), an immunological blood test for food intolerance
      reactions, is ideal to identify and eliminate individual food stimuli that may
      act as triggers for the cellular nonspecific immune response. Although the test
      is not diagnostic, studies have established that it can be a useful screening
      tool for the identification of foreign substances that may trigger immune cell
      activation, particularly of neutrophils, leading to inflammatory disorders. The
      ALCAT test, coupled with a targeted diet that is individually tailored according 
      to the test's results, may support immune homeostasis and provide a valuable
      complementary approach for therapy and overall health.

PG  - 171-80
LID - 10.1159/000371700 [doi]
AB  - Gastrointestinal food allergies present during early childhood with a diverse
      range of symptoms. Cow's milk, soy and wheat are the three most common
      gastrointestinal food allergens. Several clinical syndromes have been described, 
      including food protein-induced enteropathy, proctocolitis and enterocolitis. In
      contrast with immediate, IgE-mediated food allergies, the onset of
      gastrointestinal symptoms is delayed for at least 1-2 hours after ingestion in
      non-IgE-mediated allergic disorders. The pathophysiology of these
      non-IgE-mediated allergic disorders is poorly understood, and useful in vitro
      markers are lacking. The results of the skin prick test or measurement of the
      food-specific serum IgE level is generally negative, although low-positive
      results may occur. Diagnosis therefore relies on the recognition of a particular 
      clinical phenotype as well as the demonstration of clear clinical improvement
      after food allergen elimination and the re-emergence of symptoms upon challenge. 
      There is a significant clinical overlap between non-IgE-mediated food allergy and
      several common paediatric gastroenterological conditions, which may lead to
      diagnostic confusion. The treatment of gastrointestinal food allergies requires
      the strict elimination of offending food allergens until tolerance has developed.
      In breast-fed infants, a maternal elimination diet is often sufficient to control
      symptoms. In formula-fed infants, treatment usually involves the use an
      extensively hydrolysed or amino acid-based formula. Apart from the use of
      hypoallergenic formulae, the solid diets of these children also need to be kept
      free of specific food allergens, as clinically indicated. The nutritional
      progress of infants and young children should be carefully monitored, and they
      should undergo ongoing, regular food protein elimination reassessments by
      cautious food challenges to monitor for possible tolerance development.

AB  - AIM: To evaluate the association between patient disease knowledge of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and health related quality of life (HRQoL) and
      identify patient and disease related predictors of patient knowledge of IBD.
      METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of IBD patients with an established
      diagnosis of IBD longer than 3 mo prior to enrollment. The Crohn's and colitis
      knowledge score (CCKNOW) and short inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire
      (SIBDQ) were self-administered to assess patient knowledge of IBD and HRQoL,
      respectively. Demographic and disease characteristics were abstracted from the
      electronic medical record. The correlation between CCKNOW and SIBDQ scores was
      assessed by a linear regression model. Associations of patient knowledge and the 
      variables of interest were calculated using ANOVA. RESULTS: A total of 101
      patients were recruited. Caucasian race, younger age at diagnosis, and having a
      college or post-graduate degree were significantly associated with higher CCKNOW 
      scores. Patients with CD had higher CCKNOW scores compared to patients with
      ulcerative colitis and inflammatory bowel disease type unclassified, P < 0.01.
      There was no significant correlation between overall CCKNOW and SIBDQ scores (r
      (2) = 0.34, P = 0.13). The knowledge sub-domain of diet in CCKNOW was negatively 
      correlated with HRQoL (r (2) = 0.69, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: IBD diagnosis at a
      younger age in addition to Caucasian race and higher education were significantly
      associated with higher knowledge about IBD. However, patient knowledge of IBD was
      not correlated with HRQoL. Further studies are required to study the effect of
      patient knowledge of IBD on other clinical outcomes.

TI  - Celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity and inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 267-71
AB  - Celiac disease (CD) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as Crohn's disease
      (CrD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic inflammatory condition of the
      gastro-intestinal tract. The prevalence of IBD in celiac patients has been
      reported as 5-10 times higher than in the general population. The possibility of 
      the presence of CD in IBD should be considered in IBD patients with long-term
      iron deficiency anemia (IDA) not responsive to iron supplementation. Non-celiac
      gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is characterized by intestinal and extra intestinal
      symptoms due to the ingestion of gluten-containing food in subject without CD
      and/or wheat allergy. Patients with Crohn's disease and SR-NCGS were more
      significantly affected by joint pains compared to UC patients (50% versus 11.1%).
      In Crohn's patients, a higher percentage of fatigue (50% versus 38.9%) and
      headache (27.3% versus 22.2%) was evident. For the association between NCGS and
      IBD new studies are warranted and, at this moment, a gluten free diet (GFD) may
      be useful more in CrD than in UC.

      inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 1773-86
LID - 10.1039/c5fo00202h [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis presently have no cure and are treated
      with anti-inflammatory drugs or monoclonal antibodies targeting pro-inflammatory 
      cytokines. A variety of rodent models have been used to model chronic and acute
      colitis. Dietary polyphenols in foods and botanicals are of considerable interest
      for prevention and treatment of colitis. Many dietary polyphenols have been
      utilized for prevention of colitis in rodent models. Berries, green tea
      polyphenols, curcumin, and stilbenes have been the most extensively tested
      polyphenols in rodent models of colitis. The majority of polyphenols tested have 
      inhibited colitis in rodents, but increasing doses of EGCG and green tea,
      isoflavones, flaxseed, and alpha-mangostin have exacerbated colitis. Few studies 
      have examined combination of polyphenols or other bioactives for inhibition of
      colitis. Translating polyphenol doses used in rodent models of colitis to human
      equivalent doses reveals that supplemental doses are most likely required to
      inhibit colitis from a single polyphenol treatment. The ability to translate
      polyphenol treatments in rodent models is likely to be limited by species
      differences in xenobiotic metabolism and microbiota. Given these limitations,
      data from polyphenols in rodent models suggests merit for pursuing additional
      clinical studies for prevention of colitis.

TI  - Dietary fatty acid intakes are related to the risk of ulcerative colitis: a
      case-control study.
PG  - 1255-60
LID - 10.1007/s00384-015-2232-8 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The role of dietary fatty acids in ulcerative colitis (UC)
      pathogenesis has been shown in animal models; however, human studies are rare. We
      hypothesized that there might be a relationship between dietary fatty acid
      composition and the risk of developing incident UC. MATERIAL AND METHODS:
      Overall, 62 new cases of UC and 124 healthy age and sex-matched controls were
      studied. Information on usual diet was measured by a validated country-specific
      food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Logistic regression analysis adjusting for
      potential confounding variables was carried out to compare dietary fatty acid
      intakes between cases and controls. RESULTS: We found positive associations
      between dietary intake of total fat (P value for trend <0.01), oleic acid (P
      value for trend <0.01), saturated fatty acid (SAFA) (P value for trend = 0.02),
      total polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) (P value for trend = 0.04), and trans fat
      (P value for trend <0.01). CONCLUSION: Our results showed that higher
      consumptions of total fats, oleic acid, SAFAs, total PUFAs, trans fat, MUFAs, and
      linoleic acid are significantly associated with increased risk for UC; however,
      no statistically significant associations were detected between the risk of
      disease and n-3 PUFAs and cholesterol intake.

      extend their anti-inflammatory prebiotic potentials.
PG  - 162398
LID - 10.1155/2015/162398 [doi]
AB  - The beneficial effects of carbohydrate-derived fibers are mainly attributed to
      modulation of the microbiota, increased colonic fermentation, and the production 
      of short-chain fatty acids. We studied the direct immune responses to alimentary 
      fibers in in vitro and in vivo models. Firstly, we evaluated the immunomodulation
      induced by nine different types of low-digestible fibers on human peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells. None of the fibers tested induced cytokine production in
      baseline conditions. However, only one from all fibers almost completely
      inhibited the production of anti- and proinflammatory cytokines induced by
      bacteria. Secondly, the impact of short- (five days) and long-term (three weeks) 
      oral treatments with selected fibers was assessed in the trinitrobenzene-sulfonic
      acid colitis model in mice. The immunosuppressive fiber significantly reduced
      levels of inflammatory markers over both treatment periods, whereas a
      nonimmunomodulatory fiber had no effect. The two fibers did not differ in terms
      of the observed fermentation products and colonic microbiota after three weeks of
      treatment, suggesting that the anti-inflammatory action was not related to
      prebiotic properties. Hence, we observed a direct effect of a specific fiber on
      the murine immune system. This intrinsic, fiber-dependent immunomodulatory
      potential may extend prebiotic-mediated protection in inflammatory bowel disease.

LID - 04.2015/JCPSP.S14S16 [doi]
AB  - Celiac Disease (CD), also known as non-Tropical sprue, and Celiac sprue is an
      immune-mediated disorder, triggered by gluten containing grains in genetically
      susceptible people. The disease may be diagnosed at any age and can affect many
      organ systems. Its diagnosis and management can often be challenging. A high
      index of suspicion is required to diagnose this disease at an early stage in
      patients presenting with atypical symptomatology and delayed onset. Although
      serological tests are widely used, duodenal biopsy remains the gold standard for 
      diagnosis of CD. Even though CD affects various body systems, Microscopic Colitis
      (MC) and refractory sprue are among the main gastrointestinal complications of
      CD, which are resistant to Gluten-Free Diet (GFD). A thorough and appropriate
      evaluation is mandatory for an early and accurate diagnosis of these
      complications. Herein, we report a case of a young female with CD in early phase 
      in concordance with MC and splenomegaly.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) share some
      pathogenetic features. To provide new steps on the role of altered gene
      expression, and the involvement of gene networks, in the pathogenesis of these
      diseases, we performed a genome-wide analysis in 15 patients with CD and 14
      patients with UC by comparing the RNA from inflamed and noninflamed colonic
      mucosa. METHODS: Two hundred ninety-eight differentially expressed genes in CD
      and 520 genes in UC were identified. By bioinformatic analyses, 34 pathways for
      CD, 6 of them enriched in noninflamed and 28 in inflamed tissues, and 19 pathways
      for UC, 17 in noninflamed and 2 in inflamed tissues, were also highlighted.
      RESULTS: In CD, the pathways included genes associated with cytokines and
      cytokine receptors connection, response to external stimuli, activation of cell
      proliferation or differentiation, cell migration, apoptosis, and immune
      regulation. In UC, the pathways were associated with genes related to metabolic
      and catabolic processes, biosynthesis and interconversion processes, leukocyte
      migration, regulation of cell proliferation, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal
      transition. CONCLUSIONS: In UC, the pattern of inflammation of colonic mucosa is 
      due to a complex interaction network between host, gut microbiome, and diet,
      suggesting that bacterial products or endogenous synthetic/catabolic molecules
      contribute to impairment of the immune response, to breakdown of epithelial
      barrier, and to enhance the inflammatory process. In patients with CD, genes
      encoding a large variety of proteins, growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, and 
      adhesion molecules may lead to uncontrolled inflammation with ensuing destruction
      of epithelial cells, inappropriate stimulation of antimicrobial and T cells
      differentiation, and inflammasome events.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: An increasing body of evidence has linked diet to inflammatory
      bowel diseases (IBD), both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Most of our
      current knowledge pertains to the link between diet and Crohn's disease.
      Exclusive enteral nutrition and partial enteral nutrition are the best known
      dietary intervention for the induction of remission and maintenance of remission 
      in Crohn's disease both in children and in adults, but the mechanism whereby
      these interventions may cause or maintain remission and mucosal healing has
      remained elusive. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have shed light on the possible
      mechanisms of response to dietary intervention. Epidemiological and rodent model 
      studies over the last year have supplied us with several dietary candidates for
      an effect of diet on inflammation and disease pathogenesis. Others have shed
      insight into the effect of diet on dysbiosis and the microbiota. An elimination
      diet based on some of these candidates has shown clinical efficacy, and bridged
      the knowledge obtained from rodent models to a human intervention. SUMMARY: These
      studies may allow better understanding of the pathogenesis of IBD and provide new
      tools to treat these difficult diseases. Elimination diets based on the
      identification of deleterious dietary components may pave the way for an improved
      control of the disease in the future. VIDEO ABSTRACT:

TI  - Single High-Dose Oral Vitamin D3 Therapy (Stoss): A Solution to Vitamin D
      Deficiency in Children With Inflammatory Bowel Disease?
PG  - 411-4
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000823 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Vitamin D deficiency is common in children with inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). The aim of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of 
      stoss therapy on vitamin D levels during a period of 6 months in children with
      IBD and vitamin D deficiency (<50 nmol/L). METHODS: A retrospective chart review 
      was undertaken, focusing upon children managed in the IBD clinic at Sydney
      Children's Hospital between 2006 and 2010. Those with a 25-hydroxyvitamin D
      (25-OHD) level <50 nmol/L and those who received stoss therapy were included in
      this study. RESULTS: A total of 76 children received stoss therapy. There was a
      significant and sustained increase in 25-OHD levels at all of the time points
      compared with baseline (40.8 +/- 7.5 nmol/L), 1 month (145.6 +/- 51.8 nmol/L), 3 
      months (87.1 +/- 28.4 nmol/L), and 6 months 69.2 +/- 31.3 nmol/L). There were no 
      significant changes in serum calcium, phosphate, or parathyroid hormone at any
      time points. CONCLUSIONS: Stoss therapy safely and effectively achieved and
      maintained a level of 25-OHD >50 nmol/L during 6 months in these children with
      IBD. Further prospective studies are now required to confirm this finding and
      establish whether this intervention has other benefits.

      Ulcerative Colitis (UC): through the validity of a questionnaire.
PG  - 25
LID - 10.1186/s12937-015-0014-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is a chronic disease characterized by
      inflammation of colonic mucosa. Environmental factors such as dietary patterns
      may increase symptoms in UC patients. AIM: To validate and implement a
      questionnaire to identify foods that exacerbates symptoms in UC patients.
      METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted to validate and to assess the
      relationship of food and symptoms in Mexican UC patients. RESULTS: The IVC
      obtained was 0.56 in the questionnaire and kappa = 0.03 in foods from animal
      origin, 0.5 cereals and tubers, 0.2 legumes, 0.4 vegetables and fruits, 0.4 fats 
      and 0.3 in others. The evaluation was carried out in UC patients (n = 233), 65%
      active and 35% in UC remission, the current age was 45 (SD; 15) years in active
      UC and 40 (SD; 15) years in UC remission. Three food groups were made based on
      the frequency of symptoms: Group A; symptoms more often, especially the active vs
      remission (P <0.05); Group B caused more symptoms in remission UC vs active UC (P
      = 0.07) and Group C caused more symptoms in the active UC (P = 0.05). CONCLUSION:
      Foods with higher frequency of symptoms in patients with UC were: beans, whole
      milk, plum, lima beans and spicy sauce.

PG  - 776-81
LID - 10.1111/jgs.13310 [doi]
AB  - Advances in bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid sequencing allow for characterization
      of the human commensal bacterial community (microbiota) and its corresponding
      genome (microbiome). Surveys of healthy adults reveal that a signature composite 
      of bacteria characterizes each unique body habitat (e.g., gut, skin, oral cavity,
      vagina). A myriad of clinical changes, including a basal proinflammatory state
      (inflamm-aging), that directly interface with the microbiota of older adults and 
      enhance susceptibility to disease accompany aging. Studies in older adults
      demonstrate that the gut microbiota correlates with diet, location of residence
      (e.g., community dwelling, long-term care settings), and basal level of
      inflammation. Links exist between the microbiota and a variety of clinical
      problems plaguing older adults, including physical frailty, Clostridium difficile
      colitis, vulvovaginal atrophy, colorectal carcinoma, and atherosclerotic disease.
      Manipulation of the microbiota and microbiome of older adults holds promise as an
      innovative strategy to influence the development of comorbidities associated with
      aging.

TI  - Consumption of vegetables and fruit and the risk of inflammatory bowel disease: a
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 623-30
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0000000000000330 [doi]
AB  - To date, associations between consumption of vegetables and fruit and the risk of
      inflammatory bowel disease have been a controversial subject. Therefore, we
      carried out a meta-analysis to evaluate the associations. A comprehensive search 
      was performed in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the China National Knowledge
      Infrastructure to identify all relevant studies. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with
      95% confidence intervals (CIs) from random-effects or fixed-effects models were
      calculated. Publication bias was estimated using Egger's test and the funnel
      plot. A total of 14 case-control studies were included in this meta-analysis. On 
      the basis of the highest versus the lowest analysis, consumption of vegetables
      was associated inversely with the risk of ulcerative colitis (UC) (OR=0.71, 95%
      CI 0.58-0.88, n=9 studies), but not with Crohn's disease (CD) (OR=0.66, 95% CI
      0.40-1.09, n=8 studies). Higher consumption of fruit was associated inversely
      with the risk of UC (OR=0.69, 95% CI 0.49-0.96, n=8 studies) and CD (OR=0.57, 95%
      CI 0.44-0.74, n=10 studies). For intake of vegetables and the risk of CD,
      subgroup analysis showed a significant association for studies carried out in
      Europe (OR=0.36, 95% CI 0.23-0.57), but not in Asia (OR=1.00, 95% CI 0.50-2.03). 
      No significant publication bias was found for the analysis of intake of
      vegetables and the risk of UC, intake of fruit and the risk of UC, and intake of 
      vegetables and the risk of CD. This meta-analysis indicates that consumption of
      vegetables and fruit might be associated inversely with the risk of UC and CD,
      and the results need to be further confirmed.

TI  - Royal Jelly and its dual role in TNBS colitis in mice.
PG  - 956235
LID - 10.1155/2015/956235 [doi]
AB  - Royal Jelly (RJ) is widely consumed in diets throughout the world due to its
      beneficial effects: antioxidant, antitumor and anti-inflammatory. We have
      investigated the role of RJ in the development of TNBS colitis in mice. Colitis
      was induced by a rectal instillation of TNBS at 0.1 mL per mouse. Intestine
      samples of the animals orally treated with RJ (100, 150, and 200 mg/kg) were
      collected for antioxidant assays (GSH and GSH-Px), proinflammatory protein
      quantification (COX-2 and NF-kappaB), and histological analyses. RJ 100 mg/kg
      maintained GSH levels and increased the activity of GSH-Px, downregulated key
      inflammatory mediators (COX-2 and NF-kappaB), and decreased the lesions caused by
      TNBS as shown by the histological analyses. In conclusion, RJ showed
      anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in experimental colitis, resulting
      in the amelioration of the macroscopic and histological analyses. These results
      corroborate with the RJ supplementation in diets.

TI  - New therapeutic option for irritable bowel syndrome: serum-derived bovine
      immunoglobulin.
PG  - 3361-6
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v21.i11.3361 [doi]
AB  - Oral prescription medical foods have long been used in hospital settings but are 
      also appropriate therapies for gastrointestinal disorders in outpatient medical
      practice. Oral serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate (SBI) has been
      shown in clinical studies to reduce loose stools and improve stool consistency as
      well as other symptoms (i.e., abdominal pain, bloating, and urgency) in patients 
      with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) and human immunodeficiency
      virus-associated enteropathy. This case series reports the outcomes of 14 IBS
      patients who received SBI as an addition to standard of care at an individual
      physician's clinical practice. The patients: 2 IBS with constipation (IBS-C), 7
      IBS-D, 2 mixed diarrhea and constipation IBS (IBS-M) and 3 undefined IBS (IBS-U; 
      also described by some physicians as IBS-Bloating), ranged in age from 22-87
      years. SBI (5 g or 10 g daily dose) was added to the patient's current standard
      care and followed for several weeks to determine if symptoms were improved with
      the addition of SBI. Overall, 12 of the 14 patients indicated some level of
      improvement through direct questioning of the patients regarding changes from the
      prior visit. One IBS-Bloating patient had a resolution of symptoms and two
      patients (1 IBS-Bloating and 1 IBS-C) discontinued therapy because of
      insufficient relief. The 12 patients who continued on therapy reported an overall
      improvement in symptoms with better stool consistency, decreased frequency as
      well as reductions in abdominal pain, bloating, distention, and incontinence. In 
      most cases, therapeutic effects of SBI were seen within the first four weeks of
      therapy with continued improvements at subsequent visits. SBI has a multifaceted 
      mechanism of action and may help to manage IBS by providing a distinct protein
      source required to normalize bowel function, gastrointestinal microbiota, and
      nutritionally enhance tight junction protein expression between intestinal
      epithelial cells. SBI as a medical food provides a safe option for patients with 
      IBS-D but may have application in other forms of IBS.

TI  - Effectiveness of dietary allergen exclusion therapy on eosinophilic colitis in
      Chinese infants and young children </= 3 years of age.
PG  - 1817-27
LID - 10.3390/nu7031817 [doi]
AB  - Eosinophilic colitis is a well recognized clinical entity mainly associated with 
      food allergies. Empiric treatment options include dietary allergen exclusion
      (extensively hydrolyzed protein formula and elimination diet), anti-allergy
      medications (antihistamines and leukotriene receptor antagonists) and
      corticosteroids. We evaluated the effectiveness of dietary antigen exclusion on
      clinical remission of eosinophilic colitis in infants and young children. We
      retrospectively reviewed charts of all infants and children </=3 years of age who
      were diagnosed with eosinophilic colitis (defined as mucosal eosinophilia >/=20
      hpf-1) from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2013 at a tertiary children's hospital 
      in China. Forty-nine children were identified with eosinophilic colitis.
      Elemental formula, simple elimination diet or combination therapy resulted in
      clinical improvement in 75%, 88.2% and 80% of patients, respectively. In
      conclusion, eosinophilic colitis in infants and children </=3 years of age
      responded well to dietary allergen exclusion.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease in pediatric patients: Characteristics of newly

LID - 10.3238/arztebl.2015.0121 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can arise at any age, with peak
      incidence in adolescence and young adulthood. A registry of pediatric cases of
      IBD offers the opportunity to document their diagnosis and treatment, with the
      ultimate aim of improving diagnosis and treatment in the future. METHODS: In the 
      German-language CEDATA-GPGE registry, 3991 cases of IBD in patients less than 18 
      years of age were documented from 2004 to 2014. The 1257 patients who were
      prospectively included in the registry upon diagnosis and whose further course
      was documented for at least three months were analyzed in two separate
      groups--under 10 years old, and 10 years and above--with respect to the type and 
      duration of their symptoms until diagnosis, the completeness of the diagnostic
      evaluation, the disease phenotype, and the initial treatment. RESULTS: Of the 958
      patients for whom full documentation was available, 616 (64.3%) had Crohn's
      disease (CD), 278 (29%) had ulcerative colitis (UC), 64 (6.7%) had an
      unclassified IBD, and 23.2% were under 10 years old. The latency to diagnosis was
      longer for CD than for UC (0.5 versus 0.3 years), regardless of age. 62.5% of the
      CD patients had ileocolonic involvement, and more than half had involvement of
      the upper gastrointestinal tract. 71% of the patients with UC had subtotal
      colitis or pancolitis. Continuous improvement was seen in diagnostic assessment
      according to published guidelines. For example, in 2004/2005, 69% of patients
      were evaluated endoscopically with ileocolonoscopy and
      esophagogastroduodenoscopy; this fraction had risen to nearly 100% by 2013/2014. 
      Similarly, the percentage of patients who underwent a diagnostic evaluation of
      the small intestine, as recommended, rose from 41.2% to 60.9% over the same
      period. The most common initial treatments were 5- amino - salicylates (86.8% CD,
      100% UC) and glucocorticoids (60.6% CD, 65.6% UC). 32% of the patients with CD
      received exclusive enteral nutrition therapy. CONCLUSION: Most of these pediatric
      patients with IBD, whether in the younger or the older age group, had extensive
      bowel involvement at the time of diagnosis. The registry data imply that
      improvement in clinical course may be achieved by shortening the time to
      diagnosis and by closer adherence to the diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex, multi-factorial disease thought to
      arise from an inappropriate immune response to commensal bacteria in a
      genetically susceptible person that results in chronic, cyclical, intestinal
      inflammation. Dietary and environmental factors are implicated in the initiation 
      and perpetuation of IBD; however, a singular causative agent has not been
      identified. As of now, the role of environmental priming or triggers in IBD onset
      and pathogenesis are not well understood, but these factors appear to synergize
      with other disease susceptibility factors. In previous work, we determined that
      the polysaccharide dietary additive, maltodextrin (MDX), impairs cellular
      anti-bacterial responses and suppresses intestinal anti-microbial defense
      mechanisms. In this addendum, we review potential mechanisms for dietary
      deregulation of intestinal homeostasis, postulate how dietary and genetic risk
      factors may combine to result in disease pathogenesis, and discuss these ideas in
      the context of recent findings related to dietary interventions for IBD.

AB  - IBD, comprising Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is a chronic
      immunologically mediated disease at the intersection of complex interactions
      between genetics, environment and gut microbiota. Established high-prevalence
      populations of IBD in North America and Europe experienced the steepest increase 
      in incidence towards the second half of the twentieth century. Furthermore,
      populations previously considered 'low risk' (such as in Japan and India) are
      witnessing an increase in incidence. Potentially relevant environmental
      influences span the spectrum of life from mode of childbirth and early-life
      exposures (including breastfeeding and antibiotic exposure in infancy) to
      exposures later on in adulthood (including smoking, major life stressors, diet
      and lifestyle). Data support an association between smoking and Crohn's disease
      whereas smoking cessation, but not current smoking, is associated with an
      increased risk of ulcerative colitis. Dietary fibre (particularly fruits and
      vegetables), saturated fats, depression and impaired sleep, and low vitamin D
      levels have all been associated with incident IBD. Interventional studies
      assessing the effects of modifying these risk factors on natural history and
      patient outcomes are an important unmet need. In this Review, the changing
      epidemiology of IBD, mechanisms behind various environmental associations and
      interventional studies to modify risk factors and disease course are discussed.

PG  - 2779-86

AB  - Idelalisib is a first-in-class selective, oral, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
      delta (PI3Kdelta) inhibitor approved for the treatment of several types of blood 
      cancer. Idelalisib has demonstrated significant efficacy and a tolerable safety
      profile in clinical trials. However, the US prescribing information contains a
      black box warning for fatal and/or severe diarrhea or colitis, hepatotoxicity,
      pneumonitis and intestinal perforation. An expert panel was convened to review
      the pathology of these treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) to propose key
      management tools for patients receiving idelalisib therapy. This article provides
      an overview of idelalisib TEAEs reported in clinical trials, and a summary of the
      panel's recommendations for identification and management of idelalisib
      treatment-emergent diarrhea or colitis as well as a discussion of transaminitis
      and pneumonitis. For idelalisib-related diarrhea or colitis (including unresolved
      grade 2 and grade >/= 3), after exclusion of infectious causes, the panel
      recommends individualized treatment with budesonide or oral or intravenous
      steroid therapy.

AB  - AIM: To assess knowledge acquired by adolescents about their inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire was given during consultation 
      to adolescents followed for IBD by pediatricians from 13 hospitals between 1
      September 2012 and 1 July 2013. After parental consent, these physicians
      completed a form at the inclusion of each patient, in which the characteristics
      of IBD were detailed. The patients mailed back their questionnaire. RESULTS: A
      total of 124 patients from 12 to 19 years of age were included with a response
      rate of 82% (all anonymous); 23% of the patients thought that diet was a possible
      cause of IBD and 22% that one of the targets of their treatment was to cure their
      disease for good. Of the patients reported having Crohn disease, 46% knew the
      anoperineal location and 14% knew that Crohn disease can affect the entire
      digestive tract. Twenty-five percent of the patients were able to name one side
      effect of azathioprine (88% had already received this treatment), 24% were able
      to name one side effect of infliximab (54% had already received this treatment), 
      70% of the adolescents knew that smoking worsens Crohn disease, 68% declared they
      had learned about their IBD from their pediatrician, and 81% said they would like
      to receive more information. CONCLUSION: Adolescents with IBD have gaps in their 
      general knowledge and the different treatments of their disease. Their main
      source of information is their pediatrician, warranting the implementation of
      customized patient education sessions.

TI  - A study evaluating the bidirectional relationship between inflammatory bowel
      disease and self-reported non-celiac gluten sensitivity.
PG  - 847-53
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000335 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-celiac gluten sensitivity and the associated use of a gluten-free
      diet (GFD) are perceived to belong to the spectrum of irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS). However, recent reports suggest substantial use of a GFD in inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD). We assessed the bidirectional relationship between IBD and
      self-reported non-celiac gluten sensitivity (SR-NCGS). METHODS: A cross-sectional
      questionnaire screened for SR-NCGS and the use of a GFD in 4 groups: ulcerative
      colitis (n = 75), Crohn's disease (n = 70), IBS (n = 59), and dyspeptic controls 
      (n = 109). We also assessed diagnostic outcomes for IBD in 200 patients
      presenting with SR-NCGS. RESULTS: The prevalence of SR-NCGS was 42.4% (n = 25/59)
      for IBS, followed by 27.6% (n = 40/145) for IBD, and least among dyspeptic
      controls at 17.4% (n = 19/109); P = 0.015. The current use of a GFD was 11.9% (n 
      = 7/59) for IBS, 6.2% (n = 9/145) for IBD, and 0.9% (1/109) for dyspeptic
      controls; P = 0.02. No differences were established between ulcerative colitis
      and Crohn's disease. However, Crohn's disease patients with SR-NCGS were
      significantly more likely to have stricturing disease (40.9% versus 18.9%, P =
      0.046), and higher mean Crohn's Disease Activity Index score (228.1 versus 133.3,
      P = 0.002), than those without SR-NCGS. Analysis of 200 cases presenting with
      SR-NCGS suggested that 98.5% (n = 197) could be dietary-related IBS. However,
      1.5% (n = 3) were found to have IBD; such patients had associated alarm symptoms,
      and/or abnormal blood parameters, prompting colonic investigations. CONCLUSIONS: 
      SR-NCGS is not only exclusive to IBS but also associated with IBD, where its
      presence may be reflecting severe or stricturing disease. Randomized studies are 
      required to further delineate the nature of this relationship and clarify whether
      a GFD is a valuable dietetic intervention in selected IBD patients.

TI  - Efficacy of Dietary Treatment for Inducing Disease Remission in Eosinophilic
      Gastroenteritis.
PG  - 56-64
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000766 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Various dietary interventions have been used to treat patients with
      eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EGE). Concrete evidence as to the effectiveness of 
      such treatments in inducing disease remission is, however, lacking. The aim of
      the study was to systematically review the efficacy of dietary therapies in
      inducing EGE remission. METHODS: We performed a systematic search for the
      MEDLINE, EMBASE, and SCOPUS libraries for studies investigating the efficacy of
      dietary interventions (in both histological and symptomatic remission) for
      children and adults with EGE and colitis. RESULTS: The search yielded 490
      references; 30 were included in the review, with most of these references being
      "low-quality" individual cases or short case series. No significant publication
      bias was found. Elemental diets in children were linked to 75.8% of clinical
      improvement, but few of these patients underwent a histological evaluation.
      Allergy-testing results have been used scarcely in EGE. Empiric elimination of
      allergy-associated foods was the most commonly used option. The variable results 
      in terms of symptom relief, however, were scarcely accompanied by histological
      confirmation. Clinical and methodological heterogeneity hindered the performance 
      of quantitative summaries for the efficacy of dietary therapies in inducing
      disease remission. CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic improvements reported for dietary
      treatment in EGE by most of the available literature are questionable because of 
      the lack of objective evaluation of clinical changes and the very limited
      assessment of histological remission. Because of the relative lack of
      well-designed, high-quality studies, the unequivocal use of dietary treatment for
      patients with EGE and colitis cannot be supported. Further research should be
      undertaken.

PG  - 37-43
LID - 10.3881/j.issn.1000-503X.2015.01.007 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the interaction of the polymorphisms of
      cyclooxygenase-2-1195G/A (COX-2-1195G/A) and manganese superoxide dismutase
      9Ala/Val (MnSOD9Ala/Val) genes and the high-fat diets and its potential
      correlation with ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: The genetic polymorphisms of
      COX-2-1195G/A and MnSOD9Ala/Val were analyzed by polymorphism-polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) in peripheral blood leukocytes obtained from 750 UC patients (UC
      group) and 750 healthy subjects (control group). RESULTS: The frequencies of
      COX-2-1195G/A(A/A) and MnSOD9Ala/Val(V/V) were 49.07% and 50.13% in UC group and 
      21.20% and 22.40% in control group, respectively (P<0.01). The risk of UC
      significantly increased in subjects with COX-2-1195G/A(A/A) genotype
      (OR=3.5808,95%CI=1.8062-5.3478) and in those with MnSOD9Ala/Val(V/V)
      genotype(OR=3.4828,95%CI=1.9137-5.5496). Pooled analysis of the polymorphisms
      showed that distribution frequency of COX-2-1195G/A(A/A)/MnSOD9Ala/Val (V/V) was 
      40.67% in UC group and 8.40% in control group (P<0.01). Subjects with
      COX-2-1195G/A(A/A)/MnSOD9Ala/Val(V/V) had a significantly higher risk of UC
      (OR=7.5655,95% CI=4.1849-11.2037). The rate of high-fat diets was significantly
      higher in the UC group than in the control group(49.73 vs.20.13%,P<0.01),and
      statistic analysis suggested an interaction between high-fat diet and
      COX-2-1195G/A(A/A)(Gamma=11.81821)and MnSOD9Ala/Val (V/V)(Gamma=9.0107), which
      increase risk of UC. CONCLUSIONS: COX-2-1195G/A(A/A),MnSOD9Ala/Val (V/V), and
      high-fat diet are the risk factors of UC. The interaction between the genetic
      polymorphisms of COX-2-1195G/A and MnSOD9Ala/Val and the high-fat diet increases 
      the risk of UC.

TI  - Can inflammatory bowel disease be permanently treated with short-term
      interventions on the microbiome?
PG  - 781-95
LID - 10.1586/17474124.2015.1013031 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis, is a chronic, relapsing and remitting set of conditions characterized by
      an excessive inflammatory response leading to the destruction of the
      gastrointestinal tract. While the exact etiology of inflammatory bowel disease
      remains unclear, increasing evidence suggests that the human gastrointestinal
      microbiome plays a critical role in disease pathogenesis. Manipulation of the gut
      microbiome has therefore emerged as an attractive alternative for both
      prophylactic and therapeutic intervention against inflammation. Despite its
      growing popularity among patients, review of the current literature suggests that
      the adult microbiome is a highly stable structure resilient to short-term
      interventions. In fact, most evidence to date demonstrates that therapeutic
      agents targeting the microflora trigger rapid changes in the microbiome, which
      then reverts to its pre-treatment state once the therapy is completed. Based on
      these findings, our ability to treat inflammatory bowel disease through
      short-term manipulations of the human microbiome may only have a transient
      effect. Thus, this review is intended to highlight the use of various therapeutic
      options, including diet, pre- and probiotics, antibiotics and fecal microbiota
      transplant, to manipulate the microbiome, with specific attention to the
      alterations made to the microflora along with the duration of impact.

TI  - Methyl-deficient diet promotes colitis and SIRT1-mediated endoplasmic reticulum
      stress.
PG  - 595-606
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2014-307030 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Methyl donor deficiency (MDD) aggravates experimental colitis in rats
      and increases endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress through decreased sirtuin 1
      (SIRT1) in neuronal cells and myocardium. ER stress plays a key role in IBD
      pathogenesis. AIM: We investigated whether the influence of MDD on colitis
      resulted from an ER stress response triggered by decreased SIRT1 expression.
      DESIGN: The unfolded protein response (UPR), chaperones proteins, heat shock
      factor protein 1 (HSF1) and SIRT1 were examined in rats with MDD and dextran
      sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in a Caco-2 cell model with stable
      expression of transcobalamin-oleosin (TO) chimera, which impairs cellular
      availability of vitamin B12, and in IBD. The effects of SIRT1 activation were
      studied both in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: MDD aggravated DSS-induced colitis
      clinically, endoscopically and histologically. MDD activated ER stress pathways, 
      with increased phosphorylate-PKR-like ER kinase, P-eiF-2alpha, P-IRE-1alpha,
      activating transcription factor (ATF)6, XBP1-S protein and ATF4 mRNA expression
      levels in rats. This was accompanied by reduced SIRT1 expression level and
      greater acetylation of HSF1, in relation with a dramatic decrease of chaperones
      (binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP), heat shock protein (HSP)27 and HSP90).
      Adding either vitamin B12, S-adenosylmethionine or an SIRT1 activator (SRT1720)
      reduced the UPR in vitro. In rats, SIRT1 activation by SRT1720 prevented colitis 
      by reducing HSF1 acetylation and increasing expression of BIP, HSP27 and HSP90.
      Immunohistochemistry showed impaired expression of SIRT1 in the colonic
      epithelium of patients with IBD. CONCLUSIONS: SIRT1 is a master regulator of ER
      stress and severity of experimental colitis in case of MDD. It could deserve
      further interest as a therapeutic target of IBD.

AB  - Ovotransferrin (OVT), one of the major hen egg white proteins, was shown to
      possess antimicrobial and antioxidant activities in vitro. However, there is no
      information regarding the in vivo preventative effect in chronic inflammatory
      diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of the present study
      is to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of OVT in a mouse model of dextran
      sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. OVT (50 or 250 mg/kg BW) was given orally
      for 14 days to female BALB/c mice, and 5% DSS (MW 36-50 kDa) was used to induce
      acute colitis (days 7-14) via drinking water. The current in vivo study
      demonstrated that OVT significantly reduced clinical signs, weight loss,
      shortening of the colon, and inflammatory cytokine markers of disease. The
      histopathological analysis of the colon revealed that OVT reduced histological
      scores. These results indicate that the use of OVT may be a potential promising
      candidate for the prevention of IBD.

AB  - Some of the most common symptoms of the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD, which
      include ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) are abdominal pain, diarrhea, and
      weight loss. It is therefore not surprising that clinicians and patients have
      wondered whether dietary patterns influence the onset or course of IBD. The
      question of what to eat is among the most commonly asked by patients, and among
      the most difficult to answer for clinicians. There are substantial variations in 
      dietary behaviors of patients and recommendations for them, although clinicians
      do not routinely endorse specific diets for patients with IBD. Dietary clinical
      trials have been limited by their inability to include a placebo control,
      contamination of study groups, and inclusion of patients receiving medical
      therapies. Additional challenges include accuracy of information on dietary
      intake, complex interactions between foods consumed, and differences in food
      metabolism among individuals. We review the roles of diet in the etiology and
      management of IBD based on plausible mechanisms and clinical evidence.
      Researchers have learned much about the effects of diet on the mucosal immune
      system, epithelial function, and the intestinal microbiome; these findings could 
      have significant practical implications. Controlled studies of patients receiving
      enteral nutrition and observations made from patients on exclusion diets have
      shown that components of whole foods can have deleterious effects for patients
      with IBD. Additionally, studies in animal models suggested that certain nutrients
      can reduce intestinal inflammation. In the future, engineered diets that restrict
      deleterious components but supplement beneficial nutrients could be used to
      modify the luminal intestinal environment of patients with IBD; these might be
      used alone or in combination with immunosuppressive agents, or as salvage therapy
      for patients who do not respond or lose responsiveness to medical therapies.
      Stricter diets might be required to induce remission, and more sustainable
      exclusion diets could be used to maintain long-term remission.

TI  - Effects of obesity on severity of colitis and cytokine expression in mouse
      mesenteric fat. Potential role of adiponectin receptor 1.
PG  - G591-604
LID - 10.1152/ajpgi.00269.2014 [doi]
AB  - In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), obesity is associated with worsening of the 
      course of disease. Here, we examined the role of obesity in the development of
      colitis and studied mesenteric fat-epithelial cell interactions in patients with 
      IBD. We combined the diet-induce obesity with the trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid
      (TNBS) colitis mouse model to create groups with obesity, colitis, and their
      combination. Changes in the mesenteric fat and intestine were assessed by
      histology, myeloperoxidase assay, and cytokine mRNA expression by real-time PCR. 
      Medium from human mesenteric fat and cultured preadipocytes was obtained from
      obese patients and those with IBD. Histological analysis showed inflammatory cell
      infiltrate and increased histological damage in the intestine and mesenteric fat 
      of obese mice with colitis compared with all other groups. Obesity also increased
      the expression of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1beta, TNF-alpha,
      monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, and keratinocyte-derived chemokine, while it 
      decreased the TNBS-induced increases in IL-2 and IFN-gamma in mesenteric adipose 
      and intestinal tissues. Human mesenteric fat isolated from obese patients and
      those with and IBD demonstrated differential release of adipokines and growth
      factors compared with controls. Fat-conditioned media reduced adiponectin
      receptor 1 (AdipoR1) expression in human NCM460 colonic epithelial cells. AdipoR1
      intracolonic silencing in mice exacerbated TNBS-induced colitis. In conclusion,
      obesity worsens the outcome of experimental colitis, and obesity- and
      IBD-associated changes in adipose tissue promote differential mediator release in
      mesenteric fat that modulates colonocyte responses and may affect the course of
      colitis. Our results also suggest an important role for AdipoR1 for the
      fat-intestinal axis in the regulation of inflammation during colitis.

TI  - Vitamin D deficiency predisposes to adherent-invasive Escherichia coli-induced
      barrier dysfunction and experimental colonic injury.
PG  - 297-306
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000282 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) colonization has been
      strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Environmental
      triggers such as vitamin D deficiency have emerged as key factors in the
      pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 on AIEC infection-induced changes in vivo 
      and in vitro. METHODS: Barrier function was assessed in polarized epithelial
      Caco-2-bbe cells grown in medium with or without vitamin D and challenged with
      AIEC strain LF82. Weaned C57BL/6 mice were fed either a vitamin D-sufficient or
      -deficient diet for 5 weeks and then infected with AIEC, in the absence and
      presence of low-dose dextran sodium sulphate. Disease severity was assessed by
      histological analysis and in vivo intestinal permeability assay. Presence of
      invasive bacteria was assessed by transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS:
      Caco-2-bbe cells incubated with 1,25(OH)2D3 were protected against AIEC-induced
      disruption of transepithelial electrical resistance and tight-junction protein
      redistribution. Vitamin D-deficient C57BL/6 mice given a course of 2% dextran
      sodium sulphate exhibited pronounced epithelial barrier dysfunction, were more
      susceptible to AIEC colonization, and showed exacerbated colonic injury.
      Transmission electron microscopy of colonic tissue from infected mice
      demonstrated invasion of AIEC and fecal microbiome analysis revealed shifts in
      microbial communities. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that vitamin D is able to
      mitigate the deleterious effects of AIEC on the intestinal mucosa, by maintaining
      intestinal epithelial barrier homeostasis and preserving tight-junction
      architecture. This study highlights the association between vitamin D status,
      dysbiosis, and Crohn's disease.

AB  - Diet may be a successful part of the treatment plan for improving outcome in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study aimed to
      systematically review all published clinical trials evaluating the effects of a
      regular diet on symptoms of IBD. Three medical databases were searched for
      clinical trials evaluating an intervention that involved dietary manipulation
      using a regular diet on adults with IBD whose symptoms were objectively measured 
      before and after the intervention. The most common types of regular diet
      interventions that we observed in the literature fell into the following three
      categories: low residue/low fiber diets, exclusion diets, or other specific
      diets. Of all included studies, the few that were of higher quality and that
      observed a statistically significant improvement in symptoms in the diet group
      compared to the control group fell under the exclusion diet group or the other
      specific diet group. We were able to identify several high quality clinical
      trials evaluating dietary manipulations on symptoms of IBD. Exclusion diets and
      the low FODMAP diet are two areas identified in this review that show promise for
      having therapeutic benefits for patients with IBD.

TI  - How informative is the mouse for human gut microbiota research?
PG  - 1-16
LID - 10.1242/dmm.017400 [doi]
AB  - The microbiota of the human gut is gaining broad attention owing to its
      association with a wide range of diseases, ranging from metabolic disorders (e.g.
      obesity and type 2 diabetes) to autoimmune diseases (such as inflammatory bowel
      disease and type 1 diabetes), cancer and even neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g. 
      autism). Having been increasingly used in biomedical research, mice have become
      the model of choice for most studies in this emerging field. Mouse models allow
      perturbations in gut microbiota to be studied in a controlled experimental setup,
      and thus help in assessing causality of the complex host-microbiota interactions 
      and in developing mechanistic hypotheses. However, pitfalls should be considered 
      when translating gut microbiome research results from mouse models to humans. In 
      this Special Article, we discuss the intrinsic similarities and differences that 
      exist between the two systems, and compare the human and murine core gut
      microbiota based on a meta-analysis of currently available datasets. Finally, we 
      discuss the external factors that influence the capability of mouse models to
      recapitulate the gut microbiota shifts associated with human diseases, and
      investigate which alternative model systems exist for gut microbiota research.

AB  - Characterized by colonic mucosa intraepithelial lymphocytosis, lymphocytic
      colitis is primarily an entity presented in the middle-aged to elderly patient
      population. Very few large series of lymphocytic colitis of childhood occurrence 
      are available in the medical literature. Ten cases each of lymphocytic colitis
      and of colonic lymphocytosis of other diagnosis, all with duodenal
      disaccharidases analysis data, were collected from the files of our institution. 
      The electronic medical records were reviewed and multiple variables were
      analyzed. The ten patients with lymphocytic colitis presented with diarrhea. Of
      these, three had abdominal pain. The age range was 2-18 years. Nearly all
      patients were Caucasian (90%) and 70% were female. Endoscopically, most had
      normal appearing colonic mucosa. Significant past medical history, family medical
      history and associated comorbidities included celiac disease, Down syndrome,
      juvenile arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. Interestingly, the most
      revealing observation was that the majority of cases (80%) were associated with
      lactase deficiency and, for the most part, gastrointestinal symptoms improved
      simply by treatment with Lactaid or avoidance of dairy products. This association
      is statistically significant. Our clinicopathological study indicates that the
      typical pediatric patient is a female Caucasian. A large of portion of the
      patients had associated lactase deficiency and improved on Lactaid supplement
      alone.

PG  - 2127-41
LID - 10.1007/s00726-014-1886-9 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), most commonly ulcerative colitis (UC) and
      Crohn's disease (CD), is a chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract.
      Patients affected with IBD experience symptoms including abdominal pain,
      persistent diarrhea, rectal bleeding, and weight loss. There is no cure for IBD; 
      thus treatments typically focus on preventing complications, inducing and
      maintaining remission, and improving quality of life. During IBD, dysregulation
      of the intestinal immune system leads to increased production of pro-inflammatory
      cytokines, such as TNF-alpha and IL-6, and recruitment of activated immune cells 
      to the intestine, causing tissue damage and perpetuating the inflammatory
      response. Recent biological therapies targeting specific inflammatory cytokines
      or pathways, in particular TNF-alpha, have shown promise, but not all patients
      respond to treatment, and some individuals become intolerant to treatment over
      time. Dietary peptides and amino acids (AAs) have been shown to modulate
      intestinal immune functions and influence inflammatory responses, and may be
      useful as alternative or ancillary treatments in IBD. This review focuses on
      dietary interventions for IBD treatment, in particular the role of dietary
      peptides and AAs in reducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in the
      gut, as well as recent advances in the cellular mechanisms responsible for their 
      anti-inflammatory activity.

TI  - Emerging leadership lecture: Inflammatory bowel disease in Asia: emergence of a
      "Western" disease.
PG  - 440-5
LID - 10.1111/jgh.12859 [doi]
AB  - More than a decade ago, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is rare in Asia. Today, 
      the importance of IBD in Asia is exemplified by its rapidly increasing incidence,
      complicated disease behavior, and substantial morbidity. In the first large-scale
      population-based epidemiologic study in Asia, the incidence of IBD varied from
      0.60 to 3.44 per 100,000. There has been a twofold to threefold increase in the
      incidence of IBD in several countries in Asia. Ulcerative colitis (UC) is more
      prevalent than Crohn's disease (CD), although CD incidence is rapidly increasing.
      A positive family history is much less common than in the West, as are
      extra-intestinal disease manifestations. Complicated and penetrating CD are
      common in Asia. These epidemiologic changes may relate to increased contact with 
      the West, westernization of diet, improved hygiene, increasing antibiotics use,
      or changes in the gut microbiota. Asian patients with CD have altered gut
      microbiota compared with their healthy counterparts and Caucasian CD subjects.
      Mucosa-associated microbiota in IBD may differ geographically. In a
      population-based case-control study, breast-feeding, having pets, and better
      sanitary conditions were protective of IBD, suggesting that childhood environment
      plays an important role in modulating disease development. Genetic factors also
      differ between Asians and Caucasians. Nucleotide oligomerization domain-2 (NOD2) 
      and autophagy variants were not associated with CD, but tumor necrosis factor
      superfamily gene-15 polymorphisms were strongly associated with CD in East
      Asians. Research in Asia, an area of rapidly changing IBD epidemiology, may lead 
      to the discovery of critical etiologic factors that lead to the development of
      IBD.

TI  - A mixed-method study on the generic and ostomy-specific quality of life of cancer
      and non-cancer ostomy patients.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to compare the generic and ostomy-specific
      quality of life (QoL) between cancer and non-cancer ostomy patients using a
      mixed-method design. METHODS: All patients with an ostomy participating in the
      Stomapanel of the Dutch Ostomy Association were asked to complete a generic
      (RAND-36) and ostomy-specific (Stoma-QoL) QoL questionnaire. In addition,
      open-ended questions on symptoms, restrictions or adaptations influencing daily
      life were included. The generic and ostomy-specific QoL between cancer and
      non-cancer ostomy patients were compared using linear regression analyses.
      Qualitative responses were analysed using content analysis. RESULTS: In total,
      668 patients were included: 379 cancer patients (80 % colorectal, 17 % bladder
      and 3 % other) and 289 non-cancer patients (38 % colitis ulcerosa, 22 % Crohn's
      disease and 40 % other) with a colostomy (55 %), ileostomy (31 %) and/or urostomy
      (16 %). Adjusted for gender, age, type of ostomy and time elapsed since ostomy
      surgery, cancer ostomy patients scored higher (better) on Stoma-QoL (beta = 2.1) 
      and all RAND-36 domains (9.1 < beta </= 19.5) except on mental health compared to
      non-cancer ostomy patients. Of the 33 themes coded for in the content analysis,
      fatigue or sleeplessness, leakages, pain, bladder or bowel complaints, physical
      functioning or activity, travelling or being away from home, other daily
      activities (including work), clothing and diet were among the 10 most frequently 
      reported themes, although ranking differed between both patient groups. Besides, 
      cancer ostomy patients frequently reported on the impact on (engaging in a)
      relationship or sexual intimacy and non-cancer ostomy patients frequently
      reported to be relieved of symptoms and restrictions in daily life. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Cancer patients reported better generic and ostomy-specific QoL than non-cancer
      ostomy patients. In both cancer and non-cancer ostomy patients, fatigue or
      sleeplessness, leakages, pain, bladder or bowel complaints, physical functioning 
      or activity, travelling or being away from home, other daily activities
      (including work), clothing and diet were among the 10 most common reported themes
      influencing daily life. However, the ranking of these 10 most common themes was
      different in both patient groups.

      carcinogenesis.
PG  - 177-90
LID - 10.1080/01635581.2015.965336 [doi]
AB  - Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) is an important molecule in mediating
      inflammatory colitis, which can lead to colorectal cancer (CRC). The aim of this 
      study was to evaluate the chemopreventive efficacy of apple polysaccharide
      extract (AP) in inhibiting NF-kappaB-mediated inflammation pathways in CRC. We
      evaluated AP in vitro in HT-29 and SW620 human CRC cells. We also used the
      azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulphate (AOM/DSS) model to induce colon
      carcinogenesis in vivo. The chemoprotective effects of AP were assessed using
      Western blot, immunofluorescence assay, real-time PCR, electrophoretic mobility
      shift assay, and flow cytometry. AP reduced AOM/DSS-associated toxicities,
      prevented carcinogenesis, and decreased the expression of TLR4, MD2, MyD88, TRAM,
      TRIF-related adapter molecule, interferon-beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and 
      interleukin-6. The protective effects of AP may be related to the inhibition of
      TLR4/MD2-mediated signaling, including MyD88 and TRIF, as well as the inhibition 
      of NF-kappaB-mediated inflammatory signaling pathways. Therefore, AP could be
      used in combination therapy for the prevention of colitis-associated colon
      cancer.

TI  - Environmental factors in the relapse and recurrence of inflammatory bowel
      disease: a review of the literature.
PG  - 1396-405
LID - 10.1007/s10620-014-3437-3 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The causes of relapse in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and
      ulcerative colitis (UC) are largely unknown. This paper reviews the
      epidemiological and clinical data on how medications (non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs, estrogens and antibiotics), lifestyle factors (smoking, 
      psychological stress, diet and air pollution) may precipitate clinical relapses
      and recurrence. Potential biological mechanisms include: increasing thrombotic
      tendency, imbalances in prostaglandin synthesis, alterations in the composition
      of gut microbiota, and mucosal damage causing increased permeability. RESULTS:
      The clinical epidemiological data consistently reports positive associations
      between smoking and relapses in CD, and inverse ones with UC. For NSAIDs and
      estrogens, the epidemiological findings are inconsistent, although general
      antibiotic use was associated with a reduced risk of relapse in CD. High levels
      of stress were positively associated with relapse, although psychological
      interventions did not have therapeutic benefits. The limited work on diet has
      reported sulphur-containing foods are positively associated with relapse in UC,
      but there is no work in CD. Ecological data reported positive correlations
      between air pollution levels and IBD hospitalisations. CONCLUSIONS: In the
      future, to clarify this area, more clinical epidemiological work is required
      where detailed drug types and doses, and complete dietary intakes are measured,
      in specific forms of IBD. Such work could provide guidance to both patients and
      doctors to help maintain remission.

PG  - 20-3
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0000000000000230 [doi]
AB  - Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease (EGID) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      are two distinct disorders that share some clinical manifestations but have
      different diagnostic criteria. In this article, we reviewed the clinical data of 
      three children with EGID who later developed IBD. This study is a retrospective
      case note review that was conducted between 2007 and 2012. EGID seems to precede 
      IBD in some subsets of children in whom the diagnosis of IBD may take a few years
      to fully develop.

TI  - Environmental risk factors for inflammatory bowel diseases: a review.
PG  - 290-8
LID - 10.1007/s10620-014-3350-9 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases comprising Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative
      colitis (UC) are chronic immunologically mediated diseases. The key mechanism
      underlying the pathogenesis of these diseases is a dysregulated immune response
      to commensal flora in a genetically susceptible host. Thus intestinal microbial
      dysbiosis, host genetics, and the external environment all play an important role
      in the development of incident disease and in determining subsequent disease
      behavior and outcomes. There are several well-defined or putative environmental
      risk factors including cigarette smoking, appendectomy, diet, stress and
      depression, vitamin D as well as hormonal influence. The effect of some of the
      risk factors appears to differ between CD and UC suggesting that despite shared
      genetic and immunologic mechanisms, distinct pathways of pathogenesis exist.
      There is a growing body of literature identifying risk factors for incident
      disease. There is less rigorous literature defining triggers of relapse, and few 
      controlled clinical trials examining if modification of such risk factors results
      in an improvement in patient outcomes. This is an area of considerable patient,
      physician, and scientific interest, and there is an important unmet need for
      rigorous studies of the external environment in disease pathogenesis and
      subsequent course.

AB  - Chlorogenic acid (CHA) is an antioxidant polyphenol prevalent in human diet, with
      coffee, fruits, and vegetables being its main source. Effects of CHA and CHA
      metabolites were evaluated on the IL-8 production in human intestinal Caco-2
      cells induced by combined stimulation with tumour necrosis factor alpha
      (TNFalpha) and H2O2. CHA and caffeic acid (CA) inhibited TNFalpha- and
      H2O2-induced IL-8 production. We also examined the in vivo effects of CHA and CA 
      using dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. CHA attenuated
      DSS-induced body weight loss, diarrhea, fecal blood, and shortening of colon and 
      dramatically improved colitis histological scores. Furthermore, increases in the 
      mRNA expression of colonic macrophage inflammatory protein 2 and IL-1beta, which 
      were induced by DSS, were significantly suppressed by CHA supplementation. These 
      results suggest that dietary CHA use may aid in the prevention of intestinal
      inflammatory conditions.

AB  - The aim of this study was to identify disease-related knowledge and information
      needs of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The 313 patients (Crohn
      disease: n = 169, colitis: n = 144) presenting to an outpatient gastroenterology 
      clinic of a tertiary care hospital in Seoul, Republic of Korea, were scored on
      their knowledge of Crohn disease and colitis and their information needs were
      assessed in the questionnaire. Patients with Crohn disease obtained a higher mean
      knowledge score than patients with colitis. The patients with Crohn disease had
      significantly higher scores about complications than patients with colitis. The
      patients with Crohn disease showed significantly higher mean scores relating to
      the patients' information needs than patients with colitis. The favorite topics
      of information needed were disease, medication, and diagnosis/operations. The
      patients with Crohn disease wanted more information than patients with colitis
      about medications used for treatment, daily life, and pregnancy. The
      effectiveness of the training and education given to patients can be maximized in
      this education system when the information about disease and medications for
      Crohn disease patients or information about disease and diet for colitis patients
      is primarily provided according to the degree of the patients' need for
      information.

TI  - Genetic analysis of colon tumors induced by a dietary carcinogen PhIP in CYP1A
      humanized mice: Identification of mutation of beta-catenin/Ctnnb1 as the driver
      gene for the carcinogenesis.
PG  - 1264-74
LID - 10.1002/mc.22199 [doi]
AB  - Replacing mouse Cyp1a with human CYP1A enables the humanized CYP1A mice to mimic 
      human metabolism of the dietary carcinogen,
      2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), by N(2) -hydroxylation to
      a proximate carcinogen. Our previous study demonstrated that PhIP, combined with 
      the dextrin sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, induces colon carcinogenesis in
      hCYP1A mice. Here, we employed whole exome sequencing and found multiple gene
      mutations in PhIP/DSS-induced colon tumors. Mutations in the exon 3 of
      Ctnnb1/beta-catenin, however, were the predominant events. We further sequenced
      the key fragments of Apc, Ctnnb1, and Kras, because mutations of these genes in
      the humans are commonly found as the drivers of colorectal cancer. Mutations on
      either codon 32 or 34 in the exon 3 of Ctnnb1 were found in 39 out of 42 tumors, 
      but no mutation was found in either Apc or Kras. The sequence context of codons
      32 and 34 suggests that PhIP targets +3G in a TGGA motif of Ctnnb1. Since
      mutations that activate Wnt signal is a major driving force for human colorectal 
      cancers, we conclude that the mutated beta-catenin is the driver in
      PhIP/DSS-induced colon carcinogenesis. This result suggests that the colon tumors
      in hCYP1A mice mimic human colorectal carcinogenesis not only in the dietary
      etiology involving PhIP, but also in the aberrant activation of the Wnt signaling
      pathway as the driving force.

TI  - Calorie intake of enteral nutrition and clinical outcomes in acutely critically
      ill patients: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
PG  - 291-300
LID - 10.1177/0148607114544322 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The appropriate calorie intake to be provided to critically ill
      patients via enteral nutrition (EN) remains unclear. We performed a meta-analysis
      of randomized controlled trials to compare the effect of initial underfeeding and
      full feeding in acutely critically ill patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We
      searched the Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 
      databases to identify randomized controlled trials that compared underfeeding
      with full feeding in critically ill patients. The primary outcome was overall
      mortality. The secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay, length of
      intensive care unit (ICU) stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, incidence of 
      pneumonia, Clostridium difficile colitis, other infectious complications, and
      gastrointestinal intolerance. RESULTS: In total, 4 studies were included in this 
      meta-analysis. There was no significant difference in overall mortality between
      the underfeeding and full-feeding groups (odds ratio [OR], 0.94; 95% confidence
      interval [CI], 0.74-1.19; I (2) = 26.6%; P = .61). Subgroup analysis of the
      underfeeding subgroup that was fed >/=33.3% of the standard caloric requirement
      indicated that overall mortality was significantly lower in this underfeeding
      subgroup than in the full-feeding group (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.40-1.00; I (2) = 0%;
      P = .05). In contrast, no difference in overall mortality was noted between the
      underfeeding subgroup that was fed <33.3% of the standard caloric requirement and
      the full-feeding group. The length of hospital stay and length of ICU stay did
      not differ between the 2 groups. Moreover, no differences in other secondary
      clinical outcomes were noted. CONCLUSIONS: None of the analyzed clinical outcomes
      for the acutely critically ill patients were significantly influenced by the
      calorie intake of the initial EN.

TI  - Abnormal fibre usage in UC in remission.
PG  - 562-70
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2014-307198 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Colonic fermentation in patients with UC in remission was compared
      with that in matched healthy subjects on habitual diets and when dietary fibre
      was increased. DESIGN: Fibre intake, faecal output of fibre (measured as
      non-starch polysaccharide (NSP)), starch, microbiota and fermentation products,
      and whole gut transit time (WGTT) were assessed in association with habitual diet
      and when dietary intake of wheat bran (WB)-associated fibre and high
      amylose-associated resistant starch (RS) was increased in an 8-week, randomised, 
      single-blind, cross-over study. RESULTS: Despite a tendency to lower habitual
      fibre intake in UC patients, faecal NSP and starch concentrations were threefold 
      higher than in controls, whereas concentrations of phenols and short-chain fatty 
      acids, pH and WGTT were similar. Increasing RS/WB intake was well tolerated. In
      controls (n=10), it more than doubled faecal NSP and starch excretion (p=0.002
      for both), had no effect on NSP usage and reduced WGTT (p=0.024). In UC patients 
      (n=19), high intake of RS/WB tended to normalise gut transit, but did not
      increase the proportion of NSP fermented. Increasing intake of RS/WB had little
      effect on faecal fermentation patterns or the structure of the microbiota.
      However, faeces from the UC cohort had lower proportions of Akkermansia
      muciniphila and increased diversity within Clostridium cluster XIVa compared to
      controls. CONCLUSIONS: Gut fermentation of NSP and starch is diminished in
      patients with UC. This cannot be explained by abnormal gut transit and was not
      corrected by increasing RS/WB intake, and may be due to abnormal functioning of
      the gut microbiota. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Australian New Zealand Clinical

TI  - Variable access to quality nutrition information regarding inflammatory bowel
      disease: a survey of patients and health professionals and objective examination 
      of written information.
PG  - 2501-12
LID - 10.1111/hex.12219 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) report a range of
      nutritional and dietary problems and high-quality written information should be
      available on these. There is little research investigating the availability and
      quality of such information for patients with IBD. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed
      the type and quality of written information on nutrition and diet available to
      patients with IBD and the opinions of patients and health professionals. SETTING 
      AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-two patients with IBD were recruited from a large
      gastroenterology outpatient centre in England. One hundred dietitians from across
      the United Kingdom were also recruited. METHODS: Face-to-face surveys were
      conducted with patients with IBD. Questions regarding the use, format and
      usefulness of dietary information received were probed. Dietitians were surveyed 
      regarding written dietary information used in clinical practice. Samples of
      IBD-specific dietary information used across the UK were objectively assessed
      using two validated tools. MAIN RESULTS: The majority of patients rated written
      information as 'good' or 'very good', with the most useful information relating
      to 'general diet and IBD'. Forty-nine (49%) dietitians reported gaps in written
      information available for patients with IBD. Fifty-three different samples of
      IBD-specific information sheets were returned, with widely variable objective
      quality ratings. Commercially produced written information scored greater than
      locally produced information (BMA tool, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patient access to
      high-quality, written, IBD-specific dietary information is variable. IBD-specific
      written nutrition information needs to be developed in accordance with validated 
      tools to empower patients, encourage self-management and overcome nutritional
      implications of IBD.
