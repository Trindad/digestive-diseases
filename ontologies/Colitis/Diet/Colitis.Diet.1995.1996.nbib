TI  - A radiopaque marker technique for measuring gastrointestinal transit in subjects 
      with an ileostomy.
PG  - 2302-6
AB  - We aimed to develop a simple, clinically useful technique for measuring gut
      transit time in patients with an ileostomy, in order to distinguish easily when
      patients have fast or slow transit. Seventeen healthy subjects (mean age, 55
      years; range, 43-71 years; nine males) who had had a proctocolectomy for
      ulcerative colitis more than 1 year previously and without small intestinal
      resection were studied. Subjects were studied on 4 days after an overnight fast, 
      two studies with and two without breakfast. A standard diet was used on all days.
      Twenty radiopaque markers were given at the start of each study day. Ileostomy
      effluent was collected over 24 hr and x-rayed to determine the number of retained
      markers. Studies with breakfast demonstrated greater intrasubject
      reproducibility. The mean transit time for passage of 50% of markers was 16.6 hr 
      with, and 14.8 hr without, breakfast (p < 0.02). From the data obtained we
      suggest that the optimum time for taking a single abdominal radiograph in a
      patient with suspected fast transit is 6 hr after ingestion of markers, while the
      optimum time for a patient with suspected slow transit is 24 hr.

TI  - Failure of added dietary gluten to induce small intestinal histopathological
      changes in patients with watery diarrhea and lymphocytic colitis.
PG  - 436-9
AB  - Lymphocytic colitis is a form of microscopic colitis usually characterized by
      watery diarrhea and often associated with biopsy-defined celiac disease. Two
      patients with lymphocytic colitis and normal small intestinal biopsies who were
      administered 40 g of added dietary gluten for four consecutive weeks are
      presented. Small intestinal biopsies from multiple sites in the proximal small
      bowel were done after three and four weeks to determine whether pathological
      changes in latent celiac disease could be induced in these patients with a high
      gluten-containing diet. In addition, colorectal biopsies were done to determine
      whether the colitis was sensitive to oral gluten. No alterations in the small
      intestinal biopsies were detected in either patient and no changes occurred in
      colitis severity. Although microscopic forms of colitis have been linked to
      celiac disease, this study indicates that lymphocytic colitis is a heterogeneous 
      clinicopathological disorder that, in some patients, is independent of any
      gluten-induced intestinal pathological changes.

TI  - The significance of colonic mucosal lymphoid hyperplasia and aphthoid ulcers in
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 706-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To access concordance between radiological severity of aphthae and the
      more advanced features of Crohn's disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 75 patients
      with an established diagnosis of Crohn's disease, we evaluated the radiological
      severity of colonic aphthae by meticulous double-contrast radiography. The degree
      of aphthae was defined as follows: AE0 = no lesions; AE1 = small nodules without 
      barium flecks (lymphoid hyperplasia); AE2 = minute barium flecks < or = 1 mm in
      size with a translucent halo (umbilical or eroded lymphoid hyperplasia); AE3 =
      barium flecks varying from 2 mm to 5 mm in size (typical aphthoid ulcerations).
      We compared the degree of the lesions to the disease activity, and reviewed these
      sequential changes during a mean interval of 10 months. RESULTS: AE3 lesions were
      more prevalent than AE1 or AE2 lesions in patients with active colitis. AE1 or
      AE2 lesions were found regardless of the involved bowel sites or the disease
      activity. Of 44 patients receiving a nutritional diet, 26 patients showed
      regression of the lesions although most of the patients still exhibited AE1 or
      AE2 lesions. In two of eight patients without the treatment, the lesions
      progressed. CONCLUSION: In Crohn's disease, development of aphthoid ulcers is
      associated with disease activity; lymphoid hyperplasia may exist independently of
      disease activity.

TI  - Diet of South Asians with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 132-5
AB  - The diet of South Asian patients with inflammatory bowel disease was studied
      using a postal questionnaire and compared with controls matched for age and
      ethnic group. Hindus with Crohn's disease are sweets significantly more often
      than either healthy controls (chi 2 = 13.0, P < 0.005) or Hindus who had
      ulcerative colitis (chi 2 = 9.8, P < 0.05). Hindus with ulcerative colitis were
      significantly less likely to drink milk than their matched controls (chi 2 = 7.4,
      P < 0.01). Hindu patients were also less likely to use spices and eat flour than 
      controls (chi 2 = 12.5, P < 0.005). No difference was found in the diets of
      patients belonging to other religious groups and controls. This study again
      suggests that a high intake of refined carbohydrate is associated with Crohn's
      disease, while patients with ulcerative colitis have significantly altered their 
      traditional diet.

TI  - Cyclosporine and 6-mercaptopurine for active, refractory Crohn's colitis in
      children.
PG  - 1355-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This prospective, open trial of treatment was conducted to determine 
      whether cyclosporine A (CSA) is effective in inducing remission in children with 
      severe, active Crohn's colitis refractory to other medical treatment and if
      remission may be maintained by 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and 5-aminosalicylic acid 
      (5-ASA) after discontinuing CSA. METHODS: Ten children (five males, five
      females), ages 1.2-16 yr (mean 11), all had failed to respond to 4 wk of
      treatment with i.v. methylprednisolone and total parenteral nutrition/elemental
      diet; three were already receiving 6-mercaptopurine. CSA was initially given as a
      twice daily i.v. dosage and was switched to oral CSA when a clinical response was
      observed. At the same time, corticosteroids were switched to the oral route and
      tapered over the next 3 months. Patients were grouped by treatment outcome.
      "Responders" were those who achieved remission with i.v. CSA therapy, "relapsers"
      were those who achieved remission with i.v. CSA but relapsed later, and
      nonresponders had not achieved remission after 4 wk of i.v. CSA. Responders were 
      given 6-MP with intent to discontinue CSA after 6 months and maintain remission
      by 6-MP and 5-ASA. RESULTS: There were seven responders to CSA. For all patients,
      the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) (score range 0-100) had a
      mean value of 55 (range 40-65) just before treatment; PCDAI improved to a mean of
      19 (range 5-42.5) after 2 wk of CSA therapy. Four of the seven responders
      discontinued CSA after 6 months and remain well on 6-MP and 5ASA alone for 22,
      13, 8, and 3 months. One patient had massive GI bleeding (from active Crohn's
      colitis), which stopped within 48 h of CSA treatment. There were three relapsers 
      (at 2-6 months of CSA), and three were nonresponders. Three patients who were
      already receiving 6-MP before CSA therapy either did not respond to CSA or
      relapsed while receiving it. The six nonresponders and relapsers required
      surgical resection. Transient side effects included hypertension responding to
      nifedipine in one child and hirsutism and tremors in another. CONCLUSIONS: We
      conclude that CSA offers a good remission rate for children with severe Crohn's
      colitis failing other medical treatment, although relapse was common especially
      if the child was already on 6-MP. In addition, CSA may offer "temporizing"
      therapy in severe, active Crohn's colitis; this may allow surgery to be performed
      electively, with time for psychosocial and nutritional preparation before
      surgery.

TI  - Proctocolitis in exclusively breast-fed infants.
PG  - 464-7
AB  - UNLABELLED: We present nine exclusively breast-fed, full-term infants with mild
      rectal bleeding due to proctocolitis. The mean age at the onset of symptoms was 5
      weeks (range 1-8 weeks). Rectosigmoidoscopic examination was performed in all the
      children within 2 days after admission, showing inflammatory changes such as
      oedematous mucosa with petechial haemorrhages. Rectal mucosal biopsy specimens
      were obtained in eight cases and revealed intra-epithelial eosinophilic
      granulocytes in seven and a diffuse increase of eosinophils in the lamina propria
      in six. Allergy to cow's milk protein transferred to the infants via the breast
      milk was believed to be the cause of the inflammation. The intake of cow's milk
      protein was then restricted in seven mothers. Following this regimen, symptoms
      were relieved within 4 weeks in the six infants who were seen at follow up. One
      child recovered spontaneously without dietary restrictions. Considering the
      beneficial effect of the diet regimen in addition to the histological findings,
      allergy to cow's milk protein is possibly the aetiology of the proctocolitis seen
      in these nine exclusively breast-fed babies, although no challenge tests were
      performed to confirm this suspicion. CONCLUSION: This report shows that
      proctocolitis occurs in exclusively breast-fed infants. It is speculated that
      allergy to cow's milk protein may have played a role in the pathogenesis.

TI  - The prevalence of occult gastrointestinal bleeding in celiac sprue.
PG  - 1163-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency complicating celiac sprue is usually attributed to
      the malabsorption of dietary iron or the loss of iron from the intestinal mucosa.
      There has been little investigation of the role of intestinal loss of blood in
      patients with this condition. The purpose of this study was to determine the
      prevalence of occult gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with celiac sprue.
      METHODS: We tested one 48- or 72-hour stool collection from each of 8 patients
      with partial villous atrophy and 28 patients with total villous atrophy using a
      guaiac-impregnated card (Hemoccult). Serving as controls were 18 normal subjects,
      each studied before and during laxative-induced diarrhea; 17 patients with
      idiopathic chronic diarrhea; 63 patients with microscopic colitis; 23 patients
      with pancreatic steatorrhea; and 7 patients with treated celiac sprue who had
      normal intestinal histologic features. All the patients underwent a diagnostic
      workup that included esophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy, and barium
      radiography of the small bowel. RESULTS: Positive Hemoccult tests were infrequent
      in each of the control groups, occurring in 0 to 8 percent of the subjects,
      whereas 2 of the 8 patients with partial villous atrophy (25 percent) and 15 of
      the 28 patients with total villous atrophy (54 percent) had positive tests. When 
      the patients with total villous atrophy were classified according to their
      subsequent responses to a gluten-free diet, 7 of the 17 who were responsive to
      gluten withdrawal (41 percent) were Hemoccult-positive, as compared with with 8
      of the 11 who did not respond to the diet (73 percent). CONCLUSIONS: Occult
      gastrointestinal bleeding can be detected in about half of patients with celiac
      sprue and should be added to the list of factors that can contribute to iron
      deficiency in patients with this disorder.

TI  - Epidemiology of inflammatory bowel disease: an update.
PG  - 417-27
AB  - What have epidemiologic studies on IBD taught so far? Consistent findings are as 
      follows: A high incidence of both CD and UC in industrialized countries and an
      increase in these areas of the incidence of CD during the years 1960-80 followed 
      by a plateau phase, and a more stable pattern in UC during the same period have
      been found. A greater number of mild cases have probably been diagnosed recently.
      This also helps to explain the differences in severity and survival between
      community and referral centre groups. The male to female ratio is greater than 1 
      in UC, and this is the opposite in CD. Mortality of IBD has decreased during the 
      past decades. As young people are especially prone to develop IBD, most of those 
      affected will have their disease for many years. In developing IBD, genetic
      influences are of importance. However, epidemiologic studies strongly point to
      possible interactions between genetically determined features and environmental
      or other factors. Of these exogenic factors smoking is the most consistent, being
      of negative influence in CD and protective in UC. Diet and oral contraceptives
      may influence disease expression, and perinatal events such as viral infections
      may alter adult susceptibility. The question remains open whether UC and CD are
      one diseases entity. Similarities in the epidemiologic features of UC and CD
      support the idea of IBD being one disease. Other findings suggest dividing UC and
      CD into further subgroups: in CD it has been suggested that fibrostenotic,
      penetrating, and inflammatory behaviour should be considered different disease
      entities; in UC some groups consider ulcerative proctitis a disease entity on its
      own, separating it from the proximally extending colitis. In therapeutic trials
      this approach has proved to be of importance, and it is not inconceivable that in
      subgroups, with regard to aetiopathogenetic mechanisms, different factors have to
      be looked for.

TI  - Colitis cystica profunda: imaging diagnosis and conservative treatment: report of
      two cases.
PG  - 587-90
AB  - UNLABELLED: Rectally localized colitis cystica profunda can simulate
      mucosecretory carcinoma. PURPOSE AND METHODS: Because endoscopic examination and 
      barium enema do not clarify the diagnosis, other diagnostic imaging methods such 
      as transrectal ultrasonography, computerized tomography, or magnetic resonance
      imaging are needed. RESULTS: Transrectal ultrasonography identifies multiple
      cysts in the rectal submucosa, with areas of echorefringent fibrosis between
      cysts, and confirms the absence of lymph node involvement or invasion of the
      muscular layer. Findings with computerized tomography and magnetic resonance
      imaging have not previously been described for colitis cystica profunda. With
      computerized tomography, the lesion appears as a noninfiltrating entity in the
      submucosa, with loss of perirectal layers of fatty tissue and thickening of the
      levator ani muscle. With nuclear magnetic imaging, nodulations produce intense
      signals that increase in T2, illustrating the mucoprotein content of the cysts.
      The presence in surgical biopsy material of large, whole cysts confirms the
      diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Reeducation of bowel habits aimed at avoiding straining
      and a high-fiber diet together with bulk laxatives can lead to complete remission
      of lesions in 6 to 18 months.

TI  - Smoking is a risk factor for osteoporosis in women with inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 367-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Some patients with inflammatory bowel disease have reduced bone
      mineral density, but the risk factors for osteoporosis in these patients are
      unclear. METHODS: To evaluate the effect of smoking and other lifestyle factors
      on bone mineral density in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, we studied
      67 patients with ulcerative colitis, 78 with Crohn's disease, 7 with
      indeterminate colitis, and 73 healthy control subjects. Bone mineral density of
      the lumbar spine and the proximal femur was measured, using dual-energy X-ray
      absorptiometry. Measures of smoking and other lifestyle factors were assessed in 
      an interview. RESULTS: The female ex- or current smokers with inflammatory bowel 
      disease (n = 38) had lower age- and sex-adjusted Z-scores of bone mineral density
      than the female patients who had never smoked (n = 34) (Z-scores in the lumbar
      spine, -0.277 (1.283) (mean (standard deviation)) and 0.487 (1.056),
      respectively; p = 0.008; and in the femoral neck, -0.626 (1.055) and -0.013
      (1.019); p = 0.015). These differences were not explained by the type or
      treatment of the disease, the menstrual history, or the use of estrogen
      preparations. In male patients no differences in bone mineral density were found 
      between ex- or current smokers and non-smokers. Coffee drinking and alcohol
      consumption were not associated with bone mineral density in these patients.
      CONCLUSIONS: Smoking is associated with low bone mineral density in women with
      inflammatory bowel disease. This association is not related to the body mass
      index, the medical treatment, or the type of disease.

PG  - 227-37
AB  - Crohn's disease (Granulomatous Colitis) is often accompanied by perianal lesions 
      which can be difficult to treat. Different management modalities have been tried 
      with variable results, these included; surgery, medical therapy, and diet. There 
      has been few prospective controlled trials of treatment performed, and from most 
      studies it is difficult to draw any definitive conclusions because of the
      variations in disease severity and treatment. The aim of this review is to
      clarify the position of different modalities of management with emphasis on the
      results, and complications.

TI  - Nutrition and gastrointestinal disease.
PG  - 52-9
AB  - Nutrition and intestinal function are intimately interrelated. The chief purpose 
      of the gut is to digest and absorb nutrients in order to maintain life.
      Consequently, chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disease commonly results in
      malnutrition and increased morbidity and mortality. For example, studies have
      shown that 50-70% of adult patients with Crohn's disease were weight-depleted and
      75% of adolescents growth-retarded. On the other hand, chronic malnutrition
      impairs digestive and absorptive function because food and nutrients are not only
      the major trophic factors to the gut but also provide the building blocks for
      digestive enzymes and absorptive cells. For example, recent studies of ours have 
      shown that a weight loss of greater than 30% accompanying a variety of diseases
      was associated with a reduction in pancreatic enzyme secretion of over 80%,
      villus atrophy and impaired carbohydrate and fat absorption. Finally, specific
      nutrients can induce disease, for example, gluten-sensitive enteropathy, whilst
      dietary factors such as fibre, resistant starch, short-chain fatty acids,
      glutamine and fish-oils may prevent gastrointestinal diseases such as
      diverticulitis, diversion colitis, ulcerative colitis, colonic adenomatosis and
      colonic carcinoma. The role of dietary antigens in the aetiology of Crohn's
      disease is controversial, but controlled studies have suggested that elemental
      diets may be as effective as corticosteroids in inducing a remission in patients 
      with acute Crohn's disease. In conclusion, nutrition has both a supportive and
      therapeutic role in the management of chronic gastrointestinal diseases. With the
      development of modern techniques of nutritional support, the morbidity and
      mortality associated with chronic GI disease can be reduced. On the other hand,
      dietary manipulation may be used to treat to prevent specific GI disorders such
      as coeliac disease, functional bowel disease, Crohn's disease and colonic
      neoplasia. The future development of nutria-pharmaceuticals is particularly
      attractive in view of their low cost and wide safety margins.

PG  - 21-4
AB  - In the last years, we have appreciated a descending number of classic enteral
      food-protein intolerance and cases of colitis related to food proteins are
      increasing. In this study, 20 cases of food protein colitis (mainly related to
      cow's milk) are reviewed and clinical, endoscopic and histological aspects are
      analyzed. We found that the age at the time of the first consultation was
      approximately 1.5 months, with males predominating. The main symptom was bloody
      diarrhoea. Other causes such as perianal fissure or infectious gastroenteritis
      were excluded. The infants were fed breast milk and/or cow's milk formula. Some
      patients had low hemoglobin, but low serum albumin was infrequent. The
      colonoscopy showed erythema and, in some cases, loss of vascular pattern,
      ulcerations or bleeding. The main histological finding was an increased number of
      eosinophils. There was a favorable response to the dietary change. After 6
      months, all of the provocations done were negative. We conclude that food-protein
      intolerance is one of the most probable causes of bloody stools in a young
      infant. Colonoscopy and a histopathological study of at least three biopsy pieces
      are necessary for the diagnosis. The treatment is the exclusion of the offending 
      protein from the diet.

TI  - [Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases and nutrition].
PG  - 14S-24S
AB  - The etiology of inflammatory bowel disease is still unknown. Several potential
      mechanisms are discussed. The etiological and therapeutic importance of nutrition
      is controversial. Though changes in dietary habits and incidence of inflammatory 
      bowel disease during the last century were in parallel, no specific nutritional
      factor has been isolated. No dietary prophylaxis of inflammatory bowel disease is
      yet known; all dietary therapies in inflammatory bowel disease aim to improve
      nutritional support and to diminish inflammation by bowel rest. Children and
      adolescents gain in weight and height. Total parenteral nutrition will not
      substantially reduce disease activity and operation rates. Total parenteral
      nutrition can only be recommended in ulcerative colitis patients with severe
      disease in the initial phase and in Crohn's patients with severe malnutrition and
      intestinal complications. Enteral nutrition support is less effective in
      ulcerative colitis than in Crohn's disease. Reported remission rates on enteral
      nutrition are 25% for ulcerative colitis and up to 80% for Crohn. However, in
      active Crohn's disease enteral nutrition is less effective than standard therapy 
      with methylprednisolone and sulfasalizine. It is generally believed that
      nutrition therapy in combination with drugs is the best treatment modality. There
      is no evidence to support the importance of any combination of the formula diets 
      such as elemental, oligopeptide, or polymeric formulations. Administration of
      formula diets by nasogastric tubes all show similar remission rates. Whether
      newer diets supplemented with arginine, glutamine, omega-3-fatty acids or short
      chain fatty acids increase remission rates is not known. Further studies in this 
      field are warranted.

TI  - Diverticular disease-associated chronic colitis.
PG  - 94-102
AB  - A clinical syndrome of chronic colitis unique to the sigmoid colon harboring
      diverticular was recently reported; its histopathological appearance has not been
      fully elucidated. In this study, the authors analyzed the clinical and
      pathological features of 23 patients (age range, 38-87 years; median age, 72
      years) with diverticular disease-associated chronic colitis. Nineteen presented
      with hematochezia; four had abdominal pain. Colonoscopic visualization of the
      mucosa showed patchy or confluent granularity and friability affecting the
      sigmoid colon encompassing diverticular ostia. Colonic mucosae proximal and
      distal to the sigmoid were endoscopically normal. Mucosal biopsy specimens showed
      features of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease that included plasmacellular
      and eosinophilic expansion of the lamina propria (100%), neutrophilic cryptitis
      (100%) with crypt abscesses (61%), basal lymphoid aggregates (100%), distorted
      crypt architecture (87%), basal plasmacytosis (61%), surface epithelial sloughing
      (61%), focal Paneth cell metaplasia (48%), and granulomatous cryptitis (26%).
      Concomitant rectal biopsies obtained in five patients demonstrated histologically
      normal mucosa. Fourteen patients treated with high-fiber diet or antibiotics or
      both improved clinically, as did nine patients administered sulfasalazine or
      5-aminosalicylic acid. Five patients underwent sigmoid colonic resection, three
      for stricture with obstruction and two for chronic blood loss anemia. Among a
      control population of 23 age- and gender-matched patients with diverticular
      disease without luminal surface mucosal abnormality, none required resection
      during the same follow-up period. By Fisher's exact test, a statistically
      significant difference in outcome for patients with and without colitis was
      detected (p = 0.049). In addition, three patients developed ulcerative
      proctosigmoiditis 6, 9, and 17 months after the onset of diverticular
      disease-associted colitis. The data indicate that diverticular disease-associated
      chronic sigmoid colitis expresses morphological features traditionally reserved
      for idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease. Its clinical and endoscopic profiles
      permit distinction from Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Patients with
      chronic colitis in conjunction with diverticula are at increased risk for sigmoid
      colonic resection. Diverticular disease-associated chronic colitis may also
      precede the onset of conventional ulcerative proctosigmoiditis in some cases.

TI  - Ulcerative colitis precipitated by a verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli
      infection.
PG  - 498-500
AB  - The aetiology of ulcerative colitis remains unknown, despite extensive research
      into likely causes, such as infections, diet, environmental factors,
      immunological or genetic defects, psychomotor disorders, and abnormalities of
      mucin. We report here a case of ulcerative colitis in which the first episode of 
      the disease was associated with serologic evidence of infection by verocytotoxin 
      (VT)-producing O157 Escherichia coli (VTEC), possibly the trigger factor of a
      previously silent ulcerative colitis. Although histological reports of ulcerative
      colitis associated with VTEC infection are sporadically reported, the trigger
      role of VTEC in precipitating, aggravating or prolonging this pathology should be
      more fully elucidated.

TI  - Total laparoscopic proctocolectomy and laparoscopy-assisted proctocolectomy for
      inflammatory bowel disease: operative technique and preliminary report.
PG  - 472-6
AB  - We present the operative technique of laparoscopic proctocolectomy along with the
      clinical course of the first four patients to undergo this procedure. The
      operation was conducted through five 12-mm ports. In total laparoscopic
      proctocolectomy, the dissection began with the sigmoid, left colon, and rectum.
      The gastrocolic ligament was opened at the level of the midtransverse colon and
      dissected along with the transverse mesocolon toward the splenic flexure. The
      attachments and vessels of the right side of the gastrocolic ligament and the
      right colon were taken last. This sequence was followed because gradual
      mobilization of the colon displaced all structures in the middle of the abdomen
      and obscured vision. The specimen was extracted through the anus. In
      laparoscopy-assisted proctocolectomy, it was necessary to incise only the white
      line of Toldt of the ascending and descending colon, mobilize the hepatic and
      splenic flexures, and ligate the vessels of the gastrocolic ligament. Then the
      vessels of the mesentery were ligated near the bowel wall through a 6.5-cm
      midline subumbilical incision from which the abdominal colon was also extracted. 
      The rectum was then completely dissected and sectioned at 10-15 cm from the anus,
      everted, and resected at the dentate line. Mean operative time was 7 h, 18 min,
      and average blood loss was 493 ml. One patient had urinary retention. Return to
      liquid diet took a mean of 4 days. Average postoperative stay, which depended on 
      full return of bladder function and teaching of stoma care, was 10 days.

TI  - High levels of DNA adducts in human colon are associated with colorectal cancer.
PG  - 5611-6
AB  - Colon cancer is one of the most frequent causes of cancer death in western
      countries. Epidemiological studies suggest that colorectal cancer can be
      attributed, at least in part, to carcinogens and mutagens present in the diet
      and/or the environment. The covalent binding of these xenobiotics or their
      reactive metabolites to DNA is believed to initiate this chemical carcinogenesis.
      In the present study, using a 32P-postlabeling method, we investigated DNA adduct
      levels in control colons from patients without colorectal adenocarcinoma and in
      nontumoral and tumoral tissues from patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma. Our 
      results show that the DNA adduct level is significantly higher (P < 0.001) in
      nontumoral than in control or tumoral colon samples. For the first time, we
      demonstrate in humans that the presence of numerous adducts in colonic mucosa is 
      associated with colorectal cancer, a finding in agreement with the importance of 
      chemical factors in causing this disease; therefore, after confirmation of the
      link between DNA adducts and colorectal cancer, the measurement of DNA adduct
      levels in colon samples could constitute a useful approach to the early detection
      of colorectal cancer.

TI  - The value of an elimination diet in the management of patients with ulcerative
      colitis.
PG  - 1176-9
AB  - Debate exists about the role of diet in both the aetiology and the management of 
      ulcerative colitis. To examine the latter, a group of patients with documented
      ulcerative colitis was studied at the Groote Schuur Hospital Gastro-intestinal
      Clinic. A total of 18 subjects, 9 female and 9 male, were randomised into active 
      or control groups and followed up weekly for 6 weeks. Subjects in the control
      group were asked to document but not alter their intake of food and drink. Those 
      in the experimental group had their diets systematically manipulated to exclude
      foods that appeared to provoke symptoms. The symptoms, sigmoidoscopy and biopsy
      findings of all subjects were compared before and after. 'Remission' was defined 
      as the passage of normal stools with absence of rectal bleeding. 'Improvement'
      was defined as a decrease in the number of diarrhoeal stools and/or a diminution 
      of rectal bleeding. At the end of the trial the diet group displayed
      significantly fewer symptoms than did the controls (P = 0.009; Fisher's exact
      test). Sigmoidoscopic findings improved in 8 subjects in the diet group compared 
      with 2 of the controls. Histological findings improved in 3 of the diet group as 
      well as in 3 of the controls. There were no foods that provoked symptoms in all
      patients, though spiced and curried foods and fruits, especially grapes, melon
      and the citruses, commonly caused diarrhoea. In only 2 patients were symptoms
      reproduced consistently on reintroduction of a particular food, pork in 1 case
      and yellow cheese in another.

TI  - Therapeutic efficacy of cyclic home elemental enteral alimentation in Crohn's
      disease: Japanese cooperative Crohn's disease study.
PG  - 91-4
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) often flares up and requires frequent hospitalization and/or
      surgery. Cyclic home elemental enteral alimentation (C-HEEA) was developed to
      prevent flare-up of CD and to minimize patient hospitalization. However, its
      therapeutic efficacy has not been studied in a large patient population.
      Therefore, questionnaires were sent to members of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease 
      (IBD) Research Group of Japan to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of C-HEEA and 
      to define the factors that may affect the efficacy of the treatment. Data for 410
      patients (C-HEEA-treated n = 322; drug-treated n = 88) were collected from 29
      institutions and analysis showed the following results. The cumulative remission 
      and non-hospitalization rates of the C-HEEA treated group were significantly
      higher than the rates of the drug-treated group in all patients and in those with
      ileitis and ileo-colitis (P < 0.0001, P < 0.001, and P < 0.01, respectively), but
      no significant difference was noted in patients with colitis. Cumulative
      remission and non-hospitalization rates were also influenced by the daily calorie
      content of the elemental diet (ED); more than 1200 kcal of the ED per day was
      found to be more effective than lower amounts to maintain remission and to
      prevent hospitalization. The therapeutic efficacy of C-HEEA was shown to be
      superior to that of drug treatment in patients with CD with ileal involvement,
      and it is suggested that more than 1200kcal per day should be supplied by the ED 
      to enhance its therapeutic efficacy.

      Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Japan.
PG  - 9-12
AB  - The etiology of ulcerative colitis is essentially unknown. A hospital-based
      case-control study examined the risk of ulcerative colitis in relation to dietary
      and other factors. Recruited at 20 hospitals across the nation were 101
      ulcerative colitis patients who were 10-39 years old at the time of disease onset
      and whose disease had been diagnosed within the past 3 years. One hundred and
      forty-three control subjects were also examined. Information on factors was
      obtained by using a self-administered questionnaire. Combined consumption of
      western foods (bread for breakfast, butter, margarine, cheese, meats, and ham/
      sausage) was significantly related to an increased risk of ulcerative colitis
      (trend P = 0.04). Of the six food items of the western food group, margarine was 
      positively and significantly associated with ulcerative colitis (trend P =
      0.005), and bread for breakfast tended to be positively associated with the risk 
      (trend P = 0.07). No appreciable association was found for the consumption of
      Japanese foods, vegetables and fruits, confectionery, or soft drinks. Compared
      with lifelong nonsmokers, current smokers had a decreased risk, and former
      smokers had an increased risk. This study confirmed a protective association
      between smoking and ulcerative colitis, and suggested that margarine or
      chemically modified fat may play an etiological role in the development of
      ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Epidemiological study of ulcerative colitis in Japan: incidence and familial
      occurrence. The Epidemiology Group of the Research Committee of Inflammatory
      Bowel Disease in Japan.
PG  - 5-8
AB  - Epidemiological studies of ulcerative colitis (UC) have been conducted once every
      year since 1973 in Japan. The number of participating hospitals in 1429 and they 
      are distributed throughout Japan. A total number of 10819 patients diagnosed with
      UC have been registered, including 197 patients with a positive family history.
      In this present study, genetic or environmental factors that may be operative in 
      the development of UC were investigated. After 1966, the annual incidence of UC
      increased rapidly, to a peak in 1974, tending to remain at the same level since
      1975. Since 1975, the daily intake of dairy products and meat increased,
      paralleling the increase in the incidence of UC. The trends of the increase in
      the incidence of UC and the increase in the daily intake of meat were very
      similar. The tendency for UC to occur in families was high, especially in
      first-degree relatives, and the age at onset of UC in patients where there was
      familial occurrence was younger. There was no difference in HLA antigens between 
      UC patients with familial occurrence and the unaffected relatives studied. It is 
      presumed that not only genetic factors but also environmental factors may be
      operative in the development of UC.

TI  - Preparing the bowel for colonoscopy.
PG  - 459-61
AB  - Bowel preparation methods for total colonoscopy in children generally involve
      whole gut irrigation with electrolyte lavage solutions, which in most children
      will require hospitalisation for nasogastric tube administration. The aim of the 
      study was to determine the efficacy of oral bisacodyl combined with a single
      phosphate enema as a bowel preparation regimen in children. In an open
      prospective trial, 30 children (aged 18 months-15 years) were given oral
      bisacodyl on each morning of the two days before colonoscopy. The children were
      maintained on a normal diet. A phosphate enema was administered on the morning of
      the procedure. The adequacy of bowel preparation was graded as grade I if no
      faecal material was encountered, grade II if small amounts of faecal material
      were present in scattered locations, and grade III if there was poor preparation 
      with faecal material precluding satisfactory visualisation of the bowel mucosa.
      Eight children (26.6%) had minor abdominal cramps when taking bisacodyl, but all 
      had a previous history of similar pain. Five children (16.6%), all under 5 years 
      of age, cried during the administration of phosphate enema. Bowel preparation was
      considered excellent (grade I) in 26 (86.6%) and good (grade II) in four (13.3%).
      In all patients adequate visualisation of the bowel mucosa was obtained. Oral
      bisacodyl combined with a single phosphate enema provides an ideal method of
      preparing the bowel for total colonoscopy. This preparation allows colonoscopy to
      be carried out as a day case procedure in children while maintaining them on a
      normal diet.

TI  - Cystic fibrosis-associated colitis and fibrosing colonopathy.
PG  - 565-70
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe our experience with cystic fibrosis (CF)-associated
      colitis and fibrosing colonopathy, and to assess treatment strategies. STUDY
      DESIGN: We reviewed hospital charts and autopsy reports of all University of
      Minnesota patients with CF between 1975 and August 1994. We identified six
      patients with colonopathy and compared them with a cohort of 79 patients with CF 
      in the same age range and seen during the same period. RESULTS: All patients with
      colonopathy had bloody diarrhea; five of the six had abdominal pain. Stool
      frequency and related symptoms distinguished the patients with colonopathy from
      the cohort population. All took a higher median dose of pancreatic enzymes than
      the cohort population during the 3 months preceding the onset of symptoms (p <
      0.002). For all six patients, barium studies revealed loss of haustration, and
      shortening and diffuse narrowing of the colonic lumen with relative rectal
      sparing. The distal ileal mucosa was irregular in four patients. A
      histopathologic study reveal fibrosis of the submucosa or lamina propria, and
      focal acute cryptitis in all six patients. Other features included ascites (2/6) 
      and nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver (1/6). One patient continues to
      have symptoms, three had subtotal colectomy, and the condition of two improved
      after a regimen including a low-fat diet, withholding of pancreatic enzymes, and 
      supplemental parenteral nutrition was initiated. CONCLUSIONS: Fibrosing
      colonopathy represents a newly recognized gastrointestinal complication of cystic
      fibrosis. Affected persons have taken larger doses of pancreatic enzymes than
      similar patients with cystic fibrosis, and have bloody diarrhea. We developed a
      medical protocol that may avoid surgical resection of the colon in some of these 
      patients.

AB  - Seafaring personnel are exposed in their everyday life and work to factors of
      ship environment contributing to the development of hypomotor intestinal
      dyskinesias, colitis, proctitis, proctosigmoiditis, hemorrhoids. Rations for
      seafaring personnel are deficient in food fibre: 11 g per twenty-four hours, with
      the norm being 40-70 g per twenty-four hours. A positive result was achieved in
      the study of the action of a concentrate of food fibre prepared from wheat bran
      by special methods in patients with hemorrhoids. The above concentrate can be
      recommended for prevention and dietotherapy of hemorrhoidal disorders of the
      intestine and hemorrhoids.

TI  - Nutritional considerations in inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 597-611
AB  - Although many foods have been suggested to play a role in the cause of IBD, there
      are not yet definitive data to support diet as a cause of either CD or UC.
      Malnutrition is a common occurrence in IBD, and this must be considered in the
      treatment of these diseases. Nutritional support in IBD has limited use as
      primary therapy (Table 2). Even though parenteral and enteral nutrition have been
      associated with remission, relapse frequently occurs when normal food intake is
      resumed. Likewise, fistulae may resolve with aggressive, nutritional therapy, but
      they frequently recur with reinstitution of food. In short bowel syndrome caused 
      by extensive intestinal resection performed in CD, parenteral nutrition provides 
      an important mode of therapy. In addition, perioperative use of nutritional
      support may decrease the incidence of postoperative complications in patients who
      are malnourished. Nutritional support in pediatric patients with CD who have
      growth failure has been effective in stimulating growth.

TI  - Comparison of an elemental with a hydrolysed whey formula in intolerance to cows'
      milk.
PG  - 211-5
AB  - In a double blind study, 40 infants with cows' milk intolerance of various causes
      were randomised to receive a nutritionally complete formula in which nitrogen was
      supplied either as whey hydrolysate or amino acids. The median age of infants was
      10 weeks (range 36 weeks' gestation to 108 weeks' postnatal age). After a median 
      follow up period of 25 weeks there was no significant difference in dietary
      intake between the formulas. Twenty four weeks after entry, weight and weight for
      length improved equally on both formulas. Plasma albumin improved significantly
      on the hydrolysed whey formula but not in the amino acid group. Both milks were
      palatable and normal intakes of formula were maintained. Biochemical and
      haematological indices remained within normal limits. There was no difference in 
      stool frequency and vomiting between the two formulas. Two infants developed a
      probable allergic colitis while receiving hydrolysed whey. Amino acid formula may
      have a role in the management of atopic infants with severe cows' milk
      intolerance who have already reacted to whey or casein hydrolysate formula.

TI  - Excretion of amino acid residues from diets based on wheat flour or oat bran in
      human subjects with ileostomies.
PG  - 596-604
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The effect of consumption of a wheat-flour bread-based low-fibre diet
      (7.8 g/day fibre; 1.0 portion) or the same diet in which the wheat bread was
      exchange for a bread based on oat bran with a high fibre content (31.9 g/day
      fibre; 1.0 portion) on the ileal excretion of amino acid residues and crude
      protein was studied. DESIGN: The study was performed as a cross-over design.
      SETTING: The subjects were studied as outpatients except on the sampling days
      when all subjects were admitted to the research ward and stayed in a nearby
      patient hotel overnight. SUBJECTS: Seven men and three women, all
      proctocolectomised for ulcerative colitis, volunteered to participate in the
      study. One female subject was withdrawn from the study because of inflammation of
      the ileal stoma. INTERVENTIONS: During each dietary period of 3 weeks, food and
      excreta were collected and analysed on days 3 and 17. RESULTS: No significant
      differences in excretion of crude protein or amino acids (free and bound) were
      found between the two sampling days. Intake as well as excretion of all analysed 
      amino acids was higher during the high-fibre diet period, although the relative
      proportion of amino acids was comparable in the two diets and their corresponding
      ileal effluents. Aspartic acid, glycine, threonine, alanine and serine were found
      in considerably higher relative proportions in the effluents from the subjects
      when they consumed each of the two diets than their concentrations in the diets. 
      The apparent digestibilities were significantly (P < 0.05) lower for all analysed
      amino acids during the high-fibre diet period. Aspartic acid (10.7%), alanine
      (9.9%) and glycine (8.5%) showed a more pronounced decrease than the mean
      decrease in amino acid digestibility (6.6%) when subjects consumed the high-fibre
      diet. CONCLUSION: Intake of the oat bran high-fibre diet resulted in
      significantly lower amino acid and crude protein digestibility. The relative
      amino acid proportions in the diets and their corresponding excretas were,
      however, comparable for the two diets.

      period. CONCLUSION: It was indicated that the effect of the high-fibre rye-based 
      diet was a generally impaired ileal amino acid absorption.

TI  - Undefined malabsorption syndrome with villous atrophy successfully reversed by
      treatment with cyclosporine.
PG  - 803-6
AB  - A 47-year-old man with a flat jejunal mucosa complicated by malabsorption,
      diarrhoea and lymphocytic colitis is presented. There was no response to gluten
      withdrawal alone, combination of a gluten-free diet and prednisone therapy, or
      total parenteral nutrition. Complete clinical remission was only achieved after
      simultaneous treatment with cyclosporine and a gluten-free diet. Rechallenge with
      a gluten-containing diet while cyclosporine treatment continued resulted in a
      relapse of diarrhoea and malabsorption. We conclude that cyclosporine may be an
      effective agent for the treatment of undefined, refractory forms of
      malabsorption.

TI  - Hyperammonemic coma due to parenteral nutrition in a woman with heterozygous
      ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency.
PG  - 282-4
AB  - Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency is an X-linked disorder of the urea cycle
      that can cause hyperammonemic encephalopathy in hemizygous males and heterozygous
      females. Affected females typically limit protein intake in their diet. This case
      report describes a 36-year-old woman with ulcerative colitis who went into
      hyperammonemic coma after administration of total parenteral nutrition. A similar
      episode of coma had occurred 7 years earlier after she delivered a normal boy.
      Heterozygous ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency was diagnosed based on a
      positive allopurinol tolerance test result after elevated levels of plasma
      glutamine and low plasma citrulline were detected. The protein load associated
      with parenteral alimentation resulted in symptomatic expression of this partial
      enzyme deficiency in this unique case. Partial ornithine transcarbamylase
      deficiency must always be considered in adult women and men with hyperammonemia
      who have normal liver function test results.

TI  - Cyclosporine for the treatment of fulminant ulcerative colitis in children.
      Immediate response, long-term results, and impact on surgery.
PG  - 474-9
AB  - PURPOSE: Emergency surgery for fulminant colitis is often complicated by
      high-dose steroid therapy, poor nutrition, and psychologic maladjustment.
      Cyclosporine is effective for fulminant ulcerative colitis in adults, resulting
      in avoidance of immediate surgery in 75 percent of patients and a 55 percent
      long-term remission rate. Over the last five years, we studied the effectiveness 
      of cyclosporine in children with fulminant colitis. METHODS: Fourteen patients
      with ulcerative colitis (age, 7-20 years) received cyclosporine after satisfying 
      the following criteria: 1) greater than five bloody diarrheal stools per day; 2) 
      severe abdominal pain; 3) no improvement after ten days of bowel rest, 4)
      intravenous methylprednisolone (1-2 mg/kg/day); and 5) parenteral nutrition.
      Treatment was begun with oral cyclosporine (4.6-9.6 mg/kg/day), and the dose was 
      adjusted to achieve whole blood trough levels measured with a monoclonal
      radioimmunoassay between 150 and 300 ng/ml. If improved, patients were discharged
      on oral cyclosporine, prednisone, and a regular diet. RESULTS: Eleven of 14
      patients (78 percent) responded within two to nine days and were able to consume 
      a normal diet, had three or less soft stools per day, and had no pain. One did
      not respond after ten days and underwent an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis
      procedure. Two patients elected surgery after 20 days of therapy and a partial
      response. Of 11 patients who left the hospital, 4 had recurrent symptoms after 2 
      to 11 months of taking therapeutic doses of cyclosporine and 3 flare ups while
      weaning from cyclosporine after 4 to 8 months. Three patients have been weaned
      from cyclosporine after 8 to 13 months and have remained in remission from six
      months to five years. One patient is about to complete a six-month course of
      cyclosporine. Overall ten (72 percent) have undergone surgery, including 7 of 11 
      who responded initially to cyclosporine and left the hospital. Weight (P <
      0.001), albumin (P < 0.01), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P > 0.05), and
      prednisone dose (P < 0.001) improved significantly in the seven patients on
      cyclosporine who responded initially, left the hospital, and subsequently
      underwent surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Cyclosporine is effective in achieving clinical
      remission in 80 percent of children with refractory fulminant colitis; however,
      within one year, most initial responders will require colectomy because of a
      flare up of the disease. In a majority of patients, the role of cyclosporine
      therapy is to rapidly ameliorate symptoms and prevent precipitous colectomy,
      improve nutrition and psychologic adaptation, and reduce the steroid dose leading
      to surgery in a well-prepared patient.

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a neoplasm with a steadily growing incidence in
      Western countries. Moreover the age of 50 and over is a critical risk factor. The
      relationship between dietary, environmental factors and CRC has been evaluated.
      At present, a number of genetic risk factors such as the genetic susceptibility, 
      tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes are thought to play a major role. The
      correlation of CRC with adenomatous polyps and chronic inflammatory disease,
      ulcerative colitis in particular, has been evaluated. Prevention of CRC is mainly
      based on a rational diet and in the adoption of mass screening programmes.

TI  - Worsening risk for the development of dysplasia or cancer in patients with
      chronic ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 377-80
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) are at increased risk for
      developing dysplasia or cancer (neoplasia) and are usually offered colonoscopic
      surveillance to reduce their risk of cancer-related mortality. The causes of
      neoplasia may be related to features of UC (the extent, severity, activity, and
      age at onset of the disease) and to environmental factors (medications, vitamin
      and mineral supplementation, diet, or industrial pollutants). To determine
      whether and how the risk (and hence the risk factor profile) for the development 
      of neoplasia changes over time, we conducted an historical cohort study. METHODS:
      From 445 adult patients with UC proximal to the splenic flexure seen in the
      Department of Gastroenterology between 1986 and 1992, a random sample of 209
      patients was selected. Patients with UC for less than 8 yr or colectomy or
      neoplasia detected within 2 yr of referral were excluded, leaving 98 patients in 
      the cohort, half of whom had disease onset during or before 1972. RESULTS: After 
      controlling for age at disease onset and duration of disease at first
      colonoscopy, we found that patients with an earlier year of disease onset were
      85% less likely to develop neoplasia than patients with a later year of disease
      onset (hazard rate ratio 0.15, 95% confidence interval 0.03-0.66). CONCLUSION:
      These data suggest that the risk for developing neoplasia in UC patients
      increases with increasing calendar year, implying a worsening risk factor
      profile.

TI  - Maintenance therapy in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.
PG  - 117-22
AB  - Aminosalicylates are of proven benefit in maintaining medically induced
      remissions of both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Even rectal
      5-aminosalicylic acid has been found to be useful in maintaining long-term
      remissions of distal ulcerative colitis. Particularly noteworthy is the
      demonstrated efficacy of oral mesalamine in reducing recurrence rates of Crohn's 
      disease following ileocecal resection, if introduced within the first few weeks
      after surgery. In all cases, the efficacy of the aminosalicylates is dose
      related, with little benefit demonstrable, at least in Crohn's disease, at oral
      doses < 2 g/day. In contrast to aminosalicylates, corticosteroids and
      cyclosporine are better suited to the induction of rapid remissions of acute
      disease than to the maintenance of long-term remissions. Antimetabolites,
      especially azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine, are highly beneficial and
      relatively safe for long-term steroid-sparing therapy in both ulcerative colitis 
      and Crohn's disease, at least for those patients whose initial remissions have
      already been induced by these agents.

TI  - Prospective study of physical activity and the risk of symptomatic diverticular
      disease in men.
PG  - 276-82
AB  - The relationship between physical activity and risk of symptomatic diverticular
      disease has not been investigated directly. This association was examined in a
      prospective cohort of 47,678 American men, 40 to 75 years of age, and free of
      diagnosed diverticular disease, colon or rectal polyp, ulcerative colitis, and
      cancer before 1988. During four years of follow up, 382 newly diagnosed cases of 
      symptomatic diverticular disease were documented. After adjustment for age,
      energy adjusted dietary fibre, and energy adjusted total fat, overall physical
      activity was inversely associated with the risk of symptomatic diverticular
      disease (for highest versus lowest extremes, relative risk (RR) = 0.63 (95%
      confidence interval (CI) 0.45, 0.88). Most of the inverse association was
      attributable to vigorous activity, for extreme categories RR = 0.60 (95% CI 0.41,
      0.87). For activity that was not vigorous the RR was 0.93 (95% CI 0.67, 1.69).
      Several specific activities were inversely associated with the risk of
      diverticular disease, but jogging and running combined was the only individual
      activity that was statistically significant (p for trend = 0.03). For men in the 
      lowest quintile for dietary fibre intake and total physical activity (compared
      with those in the opposite extreme), the RR was 2.56 (95% CI 1.36, 4.82).
      Physical activity, along with a high fibre diet, may be an important factor in
      the prevention of symptomatic diverticular disease.

TI  - [Development of Wernicke's encephalopathy during the period of oral food intake
      after a subtotal colectomy for ulcerative colitis].
PG  - 169-74
AB  - A 61-year-old woman was hospitalized because of ulcerative colitis which had
      caused fever, vomiting and diarrhea since June 16, 1992. Then she developed toxic
      megacolon, and was transferred to our hospital on the 1st of July and underwent
      subtotal colectomy the same day. After surgery, she received intravenous
      hyperalimentation (IVH) which contained 1,000 Kcal/day without vitamin
      supplementation. From the 8th to the 13th post-operative days, she took 3/4 or
      more of the liquid diet which contained 1,050 Kcal, protein 35 g, carbohydrate
      166 g and vitamin B1 0.59 mg per day. From the 14th to the 23rd post-operative
      days, she ate 4/5 or more of the oral diet which contained 1,700 Kcal/day,
      protein 68 g, carbohydrate 236 g and vitamin B1 0.93 mg per day. During the 7th
      to the 23rd day, the IVH was reduced to 800 Kcal and then 500 Kcal per day. She
      talked less on the 19th post-operative day, and in a few days, her level of
      consciousness began to decline progressively. On the 27th post-operative day,
      neurological examinations revealed the following: semi-coma, almost fixed pupils 
      which were 3 mm in diameter, absent doll's eye movement to all directions,
      flaccid extremities with abolished deep tendon reflexes. Pertinent abnormalities 
      on laboratory data at that time consisted of hemoglobin 7.8 g/dl and serum total 
      protein 5.4 g/dl. Lumbar puncture revealed normal cerebrospinal fluid under
      normal opening pressure. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) taken on the
      27th post-operative day demonstrated, on T2-weighted images, symmetrical high
      intensity lesions in the periventricular areas of the third and fourth
      ventricles, and periaqueductal area of the midbrain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

TI  - Colorectal cancer risk factors: a case-control study in Bangkok.
PG  - 118-22
AB  - A case-control study for colorectal cancer risk factors was conducted in Bangkok,
      Thailand. A total of 279 incident cases of colorectal cancer were individually
      matched by sex, age and same hospital to 279 hospital controls with other cancers
      except gastrointestinal cancer. Each subject was interviewed with regard to bowel
      pattern information, family history, past history of illness and dietary
      information. The major findings were elevated risk for those with a history of
      bowel polyps (OR = 14.69, 95%CI = 2.01-301.46), parent's history of colon cancer 
      (OR = 4.00, 95%CI = 1.39-12.43), anal abscess (OR = 3.78, 95%CI = 0.97-17.24),
      chronic colitis (OR = 3.61, 95%CI = 1.67-8.00), chronic hemorrhoid (OR = 3.13,
      95%CI = 2.03-4.86) and the frequency of stools every three days or more (OR =
      2.16, 95%CI = 1.17-4.01). The results also indicated an increased risk for
      dietary factors; bacon (OR = 12.49, 95%CI = 1.68-269.1) and butter (OR = 2.68,
      95%CI = 1.29-5.68). There was a protective effect provided by banana (OR = 0.54, 
      95%CI = 0.37-0.79) and papaya (OR = 0.58, 95%CI = 0.40-0.84) for colorectal
      cancer. In unconditional logistic regression analysis, bacon showed the highest
      risk for colorectal cancer (OR = 8.82, 95%CI = 1.03-75.57), instead of bowel
      polyps (OR = 4.50, 95%CI = 0.48-42.59). The data suggest that nitrite-treated
      meat increases colorectal cancer risk while dietary fiber decreases colorectal
      cancer risk.

TI  - Dietary habits as risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 47-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the influence of dietary factors in Italian patients with
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. DESIGN: We studied dietary habits
      immediately prior to the onset of disease in 104 patients enrolled in a
      prospective, epidemiological study of the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease
      in Italy. METHODS: Each patient was interviewed using a recall questionnaire to
      provide information on the daily intake of nutrients. The differences in diet
      between patients and healthy subjects matched for age, sex and city of residence 
      were determined. RESULTS: Our data confirm that patients with Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis have a high intake of total carbohydrate, starch and refined
      sugar. This resulted in a significantly higher relative risk (P < 0.001) in both 
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease patients. Total protein intake was
      significantly higher in ulcerative colitis, but not in Crohn's disease patients, 
      than in controls. Fibre consumption did not differ between patients and controls.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that carbohydrate consumption is significantly
      higher in IBD patients than in healthy controls. Ulcerative colitis patients also
      consumed more total protein than controls. The pathogenetic significance of these
      findings, however, remains unclear.

TI  - [What is the role of nutrition in ulcerative colitis? A contribution to the
      current status of diet therapy in treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases].
PG  - 4-11
AB  - Nutritional therapy for ulcerative colitis (UC) is controversial. Studies are
      usually designed to investigate total parenteral (TPN) or total enteral nutrition
      (TEN), and before these can be compared it is necessary to differentiate between 
      the different therapeutic aims. The aims of artificial nutritional support in
      patients with UC are the readjustment of the nutritional status, possible
      remission of disease activity, and decrease in the incidence of surgical
      intervention or postoperative complication. Owing to the heterogeneity of the
      results published so far, it is still difficult to compare studies. Nevertheless,
      they indicate that the extent and severity of the colitis and the patient
      selection are of paramount importance in the implementation of nutritional
      therapy. Positive effects of TPN reported from non-controlled studies were not
      confirmed by controlled trials. Moreover, TPN was no more effective than an oral 
      diet. Regarding remission rates or operative interventions needed, TPN had more
      side effects than and no defined advantages over TEN. TEN seems to be useful for 
      certain patients. In some patients with UC, it seems to be accompanied by fewer
      postoperative complications. However, a definitive conclusion on the effects of
      TEN or TPN is not yet possible. In this context, certain fatty acids may have an 
      important role in the treatment of UC. In prospective, randomized and controlled 
      studies omega-3 fatty acids were found to be therapeutically useful. A reduction 
      of the steroid doses needed is particularly important. Another therapeutic
      approach in distal UC is seen in the rectal administration of short chain fatty
      acids.
