TI  - Observations in the blood lipid profile in patients undergoing restorative
      proctocolectomy.
PG  - 227-35
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ileal dysfunction, and resection or exclusion may affect intestinal
      bile acid resorption resulting in alterations in serum lipid concentration. In
      restorative proctocolectomy, the different procedures may involve the ileum in
      all three ways. AIM: The aim of the present study was to analyse possible changes
      of the blood lipid profile during the different steps of restorative
      proctocolectomy operative procedure. METHOD: There were nineteen elective
      patients on their ordinary diet and 19 emergency patients on total parenteral
      nutrition. The former group were primarily operated on with colectomy; ileoanal
      pouch and loop ileostomy while the later group had had an emergency colectomy and
      terminal ileostomy before the pouch operation. Thirty five of the patients had
      ulcerative colitis, 2 had familial colon polyposis and 1 familial cancer
      syndrome. Blood specimens were collected in the mornings with the patients in a
      fasting state. The emergency patients were on unchanged ordinary diet during the 
      preoperative period. Serum cholesterol and triglyceride were determined by
      enzymatic methods. Lipoproteins, studied only in the elective patients, were
      analysed by a combination of ultracentrifugation and precipitation. Student's
      t-test with Bonferroni's correction for multiple comparisons was used for
      statistic calculations. RESULTS: Preoperatively, the emergency group had
      significantly lower serum cholesterol but not serum triglycerides values compared
      to the elective group. This finding is probably due to difference in the
      preoperative nutrition. The cholesterol levels among patients who received
      steroids in the two groups were compared and found to be significantly lower in
      the emergency group. Later, no significant differences concerning cholesterol and
      triglycerides were found between the groups. The cholesterol level was not
      significantly different in the elective group between patients who receive
      hydrocortisone and those who did not. During the period with loop ileostomy
      cholesterol was significantly lowered while the triglycerides were significantly 
      increased compared to the preoperative values of the elective group. The decrease
      of serum cholesterol levels was correlated to the length of the excluded ileum.
      During the same period alpha-lipoprotein decreased significantly and reached
      values below the normal of the reference material. Beta-lipoproteins, which were 
      subnormal already preoperatively, increased but not significantly.
      Pre-beta-lipoproteins were at the same level at all stations. At 12 months with
      functioning pouches all analysed values, with the exception of beta-lipoproteins.
      were within the normal limits set by the reference material. In the emergency
      group the patterns for triglycerides and cholesterol were similar but for the
      preoperatively depressed cholesterol values. After 12 months with functioning
      pouch the serum cholesterol and triglycerides were at the same level as for the
      elective patients. CONCLUSION: A serum lipid profile was studied in patients
      undergoing restorative proctocolectomy. Serum cholesterol and alpha-lipoprotein
      decreased and triglycerides increased when the patients had a diverting loop
      ileostomy. At 12 months after it's closure and with a functioning pouch, the
      patients had the same profile as the elective patients preoperatively, and with
      exception of beta-lipoproteins within normal limits in spite of the loss of the
      colon and the construction of a pouch of the distal ileum.

TI  - Responses of people with inflammatory bowel disease to foods consumed.
PG  - 160-7
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the reactions of people with IBD to foods
      consumed. A database was created to capture the season of data collection, the
      disease, the food, and the subject's reaction to each food. A 122-item food list 
      was used. Sixty patients with IBD (n = 33 persons with Crohn's disease, n = 27
      persons with ulcerative colitis) completed the questionnaire about foods and
      their reactions to the foods in the fall and spring representing summer and
      winter consumption. Foods that made the subjects feel better and worse were
      identified. Although the original purpose of the study was to assess people with 
      IBD as a group, it became apparent that reactions to foods were different
      according to whether a subject had Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Failure
      to distinguish between the two diseases and use only the pooled data made the
      data meaningless. The importance of this finding and themes related to foods that
      had a positive or negative effect on the subjects is discussed in this article.

TI  - Refractory coeliac disease: a window between coeliac disease and enteropathy
      associated T cell lymphoma.
PG  - 32-7
AB  - The treatment of coeliac disease (CD) is straightforward and simple: life-long
      adherence to a gluten-free diet. However, in a small subgroup of patients, the
      clinical and histological abnormalities persist or recur. This non-responsiveness
      leaves a poorly understood syndrome known as refractory coeliac disease (RCD). A 
      specific definition of RCD is lacking in the literature. We speculate that RCD
      may appear in a subgroup of coeliacs with persisting histologic abnormalities. In
      all patients screened for RCD we look for DQ2 and DQ8. In non-DQ2/DQ8 patients we
      reconsider the diagnosis of CD and of auto-immune enteropathy. Most of the
      patients referred to us because of suspicion of RCD are affected by other
      diseases. Probably the commonest cause of non-responsiveness is continued gluten 
      intake. Exocrine pancreas insufficiency, hyperthyroid disease, collagenous
      colitis are other common explanations. RCD and enteropathy-associated T cell
      lymphomas (EATL) can be distinguished by intra-epithelial lymphocyte phenotyping 
      and TCR-gamma gene rearrangements. In RCD, an unexplained sustained stimulation
      of T cell cytotoxic activity is present. Immunosuppressive treatment might
      moderate this. Cyclosporine has been reported as a resounding success in case
      reports; however, our results were disappointing. We suggest azathioprine and
      steroids in RCD without aberrant T-lymphocytes in their mucosa. However, in RCD
      with aberrant T-lymphocytes we suggest chemotherapy. As the prognosis of EATLs is
      extremely poor the early detection of RCD with aberrant T cells is crucial.

TI  - Decreased anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody titer by mesalazine in patients 
      with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1400-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: Saccharomyces cerevisiae may contribute to the pathophysiology of
      Crohn's disease. We determined serum anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody
      (ASCA) levels in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS AND RESULTS:
      Immunoglobulin G (IgG) ASCA was measured by using an ELISA in serum samples from 
      19 patients with ulcerative colitis, 18 patients with Crohn's disease and 7
      healthy controls. The ASCA level was significantly higher in patients with
      ulcerative colitis and patients with Crohn's disease than in controls, and was
      significantly higher in patients with Crohn's disease compared with patients with
      ulcerative colitis. Age, gender, disease activity, extent of disease and small
      bowel involvement each did not affect ASCA levels. The use of elemental or
      polymeric diet therapy for Crohn's disease and administration of corticosteroids 
      to patients with inflammatory bowel disease also did not affect ASCA levels. The 
      ASCA titer was significantly lower in patients with Crohn's disease taking
      mesalazine than in those not taking it, although, serum IgG levels did not differ
      between these two groups, which might imply a suppression of IgG production by
      mesalazine at the intestinal level. CONCLUSIONS: The finding of increased serum
      ASCA titers in patients with inflammatory bowel disease suggests that
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae may play a role in the pathophysiology of this
      condition.

PG  - 747-56
AB  - Till about 3 decades ago, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was considered as
      non-existent in our country. However, since that time several reports of IBD,
      mainly ulcerative colitis have been published. More recently, Crohn's disease is 
      also being reported from the country. This trend of UC appearing first in a
      population followed by CD also appears to be true in other developing nations. A 
      substantial increase in the rates of CD over UC in the last few decades is
      reported from developed nations as well. Of the other epidemiological factors, an
      increased risk of CD and lower risk of UC in smokers is established in adults.
      However, it appears that smoking increases the risk of IBD in children. The
      etiology of IBD remains elusive. Within the triad of genetics, immunity and
      antigen responsible for the development of IBD, maximum advances have been made
      in the field of immune aberrations and this is being exploited to treat the
      disease. It is well established that IBD results from a disordered immune system 
      in the gut, in response to an unidentified antigen in a predisposed individual.
      The immune response is enhanced and revolves around antigen-presenting cells, CD 
      4 T-lymphocytes and tumor necrosis factor alpha. CD results from an enhanced Th1 
      activity. The pathogenesis of UC is less clear but appears to be humoral.
      Advances in diagnostics include the availability of serology, ultrasound and
      nuclear scans, none of which have been tried in our setting where infectious
      diseases and tuberculosis is rampant. Growth failure and the importance of
      nutrition in IBD, especially CD, cannot be underemphasized. In many situations
      nutritional interventions have been used solely as a form of therapy for CD.
      Newer steroid molecules with minimal systemic effects are also being considered. 
      Other treatment options highlighted are the use of immunosuppressive agents,
      biologic agents and role of surgery.

TI  - Contribution of dietary protein to sulfide production in the large intestine: an 
      in vitro and a controlled feeding study in humans.
PG  - 1488-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hydrogen sulfide is a luminally acting, bacterially derived cell
      poison that has been implicated in ulcerative colitis. Sulfide generation in the 
      colon is probably driven by dietary components such as sulfur-containing amino
      acids (SAAs) and inorganic sulfur (eg, sulfite). OBJECTIVE: We assessed the
      contribution of SAAs from meat to sulfide production by intestinal bacteria with 
      use of both a model culture system in vitro and an in vivo human feeding study.
      DESIGN: Five healthy men were housed in a metabolic suite and fed a sequence of 5
      diets for 10 d each. Meat intake ranged from 0 g/d with a vegetarian diet to 600 
      g/d with a high-meat diet. Fecal sulfide and urinary sulfate were measured in
      samples collected on days 9 and 10 of each diet period. Additionally, 5 or 10 g
      bovine serum albumin or casein/L was added to batch cultures inoculated with
      feces from 4 healthy volunteers. Concentrations of sulfide, ammonia, and
      Lowry-reactive substances were measured over 48 h. RESULTS: Mean (+/-SEM) fecal
      sulfide concentrations ranged from 0.22 +/- 0.02 mmol/kg with the 0-g/d diet to
      3.38 +/- 0.31 mmol/kg with the 600-g/d diet and were significantly related to
      meat intake (P: < 0.001). Sulfide formation in fecal batch cultures supplemented 
      with both bovine serum albumin and casein correlated with protein digestion, as
      measured by the disappearance of Lowry-reactive substances and the appearance of 
      ammonia. CONCLUSION: Dietary protein from meat is an important substrate for
      sulfide generation by bacteria in the human large intestine.

TI  - [Association of asymptomatic celiac disease and Crohn's disease].
PG  - 411-2
AB  - A 24-year-old woman had Crohn's colitis which had been diagnosed in 1997. The
      patient was given sulfazalazine and responded well. Antiendomysial and
      antigliadin antibodies were positive. Diagnosis of celiac disease was confirmed
      by duodenal biopsy showing villous atrophy and an increased number of lymphocytes
      infiltrating the epithelium. Few cases associating Crohn's disease and celiac
      disease have been reported. This case illustrates the complexity of the
      pathogenic mechanisms in these two disease. Our patient required a gluten-free
      diet although the celiac disease was asymptomatic, basically to avoid the risk of
      malignancy associated with celiac disease.

TI  - The epidemiology and the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 154-67
AB  - The etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is still unknown. However, a
      satisfactory solution cannot be far away. IBD actually encompasses two diseases, 
      i.e. Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerous colitis (UC). These diseases resemble each
      other so closely that they cannot be distinguished even pathologically, but
      differ from each other sufficiently to regard them as independent entities.
      Epidemiological observations may be helpful in identifying the true causative
      factors of this evasive disease. Geographically, the prevalence of the disease
      has a slope from North to South and, to a lesser degree, from West to East. The
      Western-Eastern discrepancy can be attributed to a difference in Western life
      styles. The incidence of the disease has been increasing world-wide of late, but 
      its spread has been slowing down in highly affected countries. Racial and ethnic 
      relations in different populations and immigration studies offer interesting data
      which can reflect genetic, inherited, environmental and behavioural factors. The 
      disease seems to have a characteristic racial-ethnic distribution: the Jewish
      population is highly susceptible everywhere, but its prevalence in that
      population nears that of the domestic society in which they live. In Hungary, the
      Roma (Gypsies) have a considerably lower prevalence than the average population. 
      This can be attributed to a genetic or environmental influence. According to age,
      the onset of the disease occurs more often in the second or the third decade of
      life, but there also is another peak in the 60s. Regarding sexual distribution,
      there is a slight preponderance of colitis ulcerosa in men and of Crohn's disease
      in women. It may correspond to the stronger auto-immune affection in the process 
      of Crohn's disease. Environmental factors and behavioural influences also are
      investigated. Diet, the role of the early ages, smoking habits and the influence 
      of hormonal status and drugs are viewed as useful contributing factors in the
      manifestation of the disease. Genetic studies show that one-fourth of IBD
      patients have an affected family member. HLAB27 histocombatibility also plays an 
      important, but not determining role in the development of the disease. Genetic
      factors seem to have a stronger influence in Crohn's disease than ulcerative
      colitis. The existence of multiple sclerosis-IBD families may reflect the common 
      genetic background or the similar microbial effect as well. A great number of
      bacterial and viral factors has been suspected of being infectious factors in
      IBD, mostly in CD. Mycobacteria, Yersinia, Campylobacter, Clostridium, Clamidias,
      etc. as well as bacteria and some viruses such as herpes and rotavirus and the
      primary measles virus. None of them has been proven as a real and exclusively
      pathogenic factor. Immunological background has an important function in the
      manifestation of the disease. If an individual has a genetic susceptibility to
      infections, the down regulation of an inflammation in the bowel wall does not
      occur in a proper way. This initiates the auto-immune process which is a
      self-increasing cycle. Extra-intestinal manifestations of IBD are of high
      importance because they can not only follow intestinal symptoms, but precede them
      by years. Hepatic and biliary disturbances (primary sclerosing cholangitis), are 
      the most serious complications. Mucocutaneous manifestations can be the first
      appearance of the main disease (in the mouth). Auto-immune consequences (erythema
      nodosum) or complications caused even by the therapy can occur. Ocular and
      musculoskeletal manifestations supposedly have the same genetic background and
      often precede the intestinal symptoms. Considering the epidemiological, genetic
      and immunological data, we can conclude that ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
      disease are heterogeneous disorders of mutifactorial etiology in which hereditary
      (genetic) and environmental (microbial, behaviour) factors interact to produce
      the disease.

TI  - Nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 324-30
AB  - The nutritional impact of inflammatory bowel disease is notable, both in Crohn's 
      disease and ulcerative colitis. The causes of malnutrition include decreased
      intake, maldigestion, malabsorption, accelerated nutrient losses, increased
      requirements, and drug-nutrient interactions. Inflammatory bowel disease causes
      alterations in body composition and, because of these changes, affects energy
      expenditure. Various approaches have been most effective in correcting
      malnutrition, supporting growth, and managing short-bowel syndrome, but the
      success of primary therapy has been limited.

TI  - [Eosinophilic colitis caused by allergy to cow's milk protein].
PG  - 167-75
AB  - Eosinophilic colitis is one of the clinical manifestations of allergy to cow's
      milk during the first year of life. We report a series of 9 infants who, under 9 
      months of age and while clinically well, presented rectal bleeding of variable
      magnitude, with or without diarrhea, shortly after a cow's milk-based formula was
      initiated (n = 6); yet, 3 cases received only breast feeding. Bleeding
      disappeared in all patients after milk withdrawal from the diet. Challenges were 
      planned after 12 months of treatment; three patients have not yet reached this
      moment, 3 had a negative challenge at 12, 18 and 28 months of age and are on a
      complete diet, and 3 are still on cow's milk free diet because ingestion of milk 
      at 12, 18 and 25 months still induced rectal bleeding. This series of patients
      gathered in 3 years, follows the trend reported in many countries that there is a
      relative increase of patients diagnosed with allergy conditions early in life.

TI  - Allergic colitis presenting in the first day of life: report of three cases.
PG  - 195-7
AB  - Allergic colitis can occur within hours of birth and should be considered in the 
      differential diagnosis of any newborn in whom hematochezia develops. This
      diagnosis should be considered after excluding infectious and anatomic disorders 
      common to this age group. The diagnosis is supported by the healthy appearance of
      affected infants and specific proctosigmoidoscopic and histopathologic findings. 
      Infants with allergic colitis usually respond to withdrawal of the offending
      antigen, by the use of hydrolyzed cow's milk protein formula or more elemental
      formulas, or if the infant has been breast fed, by the strict removal of the
      offending antigen from the breast-feeding mother's diet.

TI  - The antioxidant/anticancer potential of phenolic compounds isolated from olive
      oil.
PG  - 1235-47
AB  - In our ongoing studies on the chemoprevention of cancer we have a particular
      interest in the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet, of which olive oil is 
      a major component. Recent studies have shown that extravirgin olive oil contains 
      an abundance of phenolic antioxidants including simple phenols (hydroxytyrosol,
      tyrosol), aldehydic secoiridoids, flavonoids and lignans (acetoxypinoresinol,
      pinoresinol). All of these phenolic substances are potent inhibitors of reactive 
      oxygen species attack on, e.g. salicylic acid, 2-deoxyguanosine. Currently there 
      is growing evidence that reactive oxygen species are involved in the aetiology of
      fat-related neoplasms such as cancer of the breast and colorectum. A plausible
      mechanism is a high intake of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids which are
      especially prone to lipid peroxidation initiated and propagated by reactive
      oxygen species, leading to the formation (via alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes
      such as trans-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal) of highly pro-mutagenic exocyclic DNA adducts.
      Previous studies have shown that the colonic mucosa of cancer patients and those 
      suffering from predisposing inflammatory conditions such as ulcerative colitis
      and Crohn's disease generates appreciably higher quantities of reactive oxygen
      species compared with normal tissue. We have extended these studies by developing
      accurate high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods for the
      quantitation of reactive oxygen species generated by the faecal matrix. The data 
      shows that the faecal matrix supports the generation of reactive oxygen species
      in abundance. As yet, there is a dearth of evidence linking this capacity to
      actual components of the diet which may influence the colorectal milieu. However,
      using the newly developed methodology we can demonstrate that the antioxidant
      phenolic compounds present in olive oil are potent inhibitors of free radical
      generation by the faecal matrix. This indicates that the study of the
      inter-relation between reactive oxygen species and dietary antioxidants is an
      area of great promise for elucidating mechanisms of colorectal carcinogenesis and
      possible future chemopreventive strategies.

TI  - Comprehensive nutritional status in recently diagnosed patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease compared with population controls.
PG  - 514-21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Malnutrition is observed frequently in patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD). Knowledge of the nutritional status in patients with
      recently diagnosed IBD is limited. The aim of this study was to establish a
      comprehensive picture of the nutritional status in recently diagnosed IBD
      patients. SUBJECTS: Sixty-nine IBD patients (23 Crohn's disease (CD) and 46 with 
      ulcerative colitis (UC)) within 6 months of diagnosis and 69 age- and sex-matched
      population controls were included in the study. METHODS: The nutritional status
      was assessed by: (1) body composition (anthropometry and dual-energy X-ray
      absorptiometry); (2) dietary intake (dietary history); (3) biochemical indexes of
      nutrition; and (4) muscle strength (isokinetic dynamometer). RESULTS: Body weight
      and body mass index were significantly lower in UC patients compared with
      controls. The mean daily intake of carbohydrates was significantly higher in CD
      patients and the intakes of protein, calcium, phosphorus, and riboflavin were
      significantly lower in UC patients compared with controls, respectively. Serum
      concentrations of several nutrients (beta-carotene, magnesium, selenium and zinc)
      were significantly lower in UC patients compared with controls. Serum vitamin B12
      concentration was significantly lower in CD patients. Muscle strength did not
      significantly differ between IBD patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study
      showed that the nutritional status of IBD patients was already affected
      negatively at time of diagnosis. It needs to be elucidated whether nutritional
      supplementation in recently diagnosed IBD patients may improve the clinical
      course of the disease.

TI  - Cow's-milk-induced allergic colitis in an exclusively breast-fed infant:
      diagnosed with ultrasound.
PG  - 379-82
AB  - BACKGROUND: An exclusively breast-fed-8-week-old boy presented with irritability 
      and non-bilious projectile vomiting. He was referred to our Medical Imaging
      Department to eliminate pyloric stenosis. PATIENT AND METHODS: A diagnosis of
      colitis was strongly suggested by ultrasound. A more detailed history revealed
      that the patient also had episodes of colicky pain and bloody stools. An
      infectious colitis was subsequently excluded and rectal biopsy supported the
      diagnosis of allergic proctocolitis. RESULTS: The infant responded well to the
      withdrawal of cow's milk and dairy products from the maternal diet. CONCLUSION:
      Allergic proctocolitis should be included in the differential diagnosis of
      infants presenting with vomiting and/or bloody stools.

TI  - Blood levels of natural antioxidants in gastric and colorectal precancerous
      lesions and cancers in Slovakia.
PG  - 37-40
AB  - A long-term sufficient intake of fruits and vegetables reduces significantly the 
      risk of gastric and colorectal carcinoma. It is anticipated that natural
      antioxidants are involved in this effect in addition to other substances. The aim
      of this study was to determine levels of vitamins A, C and E, as well as
      beta-carotene, selenium, zinc and copper in blood of 249 patients with
      precancerous lesions (atrophic gastritis, gastric hyperplastic polyp, gastric,
      colonic and rectal adenoma, chronic ulcerative colitis) and in 96 individuals
      with gastric, colonic or rectal carcinoma and to compare these levels with the
      values of a control group of 130 healthy individuals. We have found that the
      frequency of average values of analyzed micronutrients in precancerous groups was
      decreasing in the order vit C > vit E/vit A > Se > beta-car. The average levels
      of vitamins and beta-carotene were significantly reduced in all carcinoma groups,
      while selenium level showed a decrease only in the gastric carcinoma group.
      Copper level was elevated in the ulcerative colitis group and in all groups with 
      carcinoma. The results indicate a frequent insufficient saturation of organism by
      natural antioxidants in groups with precancerous lesions and carcinomas of
      stomach and colorectum. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the general
      consumption of fruits and vegetables in Slovakia as a part of primary prevention 
      of malignant diseases in these organs. Chemoprevention may be recommended in
      individuals with precancerous lesions.

TI  - Ruminant gastrointestinal cell proliferation and clearance of Escherichia coli
      O157:H7.
PG  - 3808-14
AB  - Human infections with Escherichia coli O157:H7 cause hemorrhagic colitis that can
      progress to a life-threatening sequelae. The most common mode of disease
      transmission is ingestion of contaminated bovine food products, and it is well
      established that E. coli O157:H7 is a transient member of the bovine microbiota. 
      However, the conditions that induce acquisition and subsequent clearance of this 
      bacterium from the ruminant gastrointestinal tract (GIT) are not understood.
      Evidence that the rates of epithelial cell proliferation in the lower GIT of
      cattle are associated with the duration animals remained E. coli O157:H7 culture 
      positive is presented. Cattle with slower rates of intestinal cell proliferation 
      in the cecum and the distal colon were culture positive significantly longer than
      cohort cattle with faster cell proliferation rates. Cell death rates (apoptotic
      indices) between the short- and long-term culture-positive animals were not
      different. Typical grain-based finishing diets and forage-based growing diets did
      not effect GIT cell proliferation or the duration animals remained E. coli
      O157:H7 culture positive. To identify a dietary intervention that would effect
      GIT cell proliferation, we used sheep as a model ruminant. A fasting-refeeding
      regime that increased the rate of GIT cell proliferation was developed. The
      fasting-refeeding protocol was used in cattle to test the hypothesis that feeding
      interventions that increase the rate of GIT cell proliferation induce the
      clearance of E. coli O157:H7 from the bovine GIT.

TI  - Probiotics and inflammatory bowel disease: is there a scientific rationale?
PG  - 107-15
AB  - Most conventional forms of drug therapy suppress or modify the host
      immunoinflammatory response and neglect the other contributor to disease
      pathogenesis-the environmental microflora. Probiotics are live microbial food
      ingredients that alter the enteric microflora and have a beneficial effect on
      health. The rationale for using probiotics in IBD is mainly based on evidence
      from human studies and experimental animal models implicating intestinal bacteria
      in the pathogenesis of these disorders. The relationship between bacteria and
      intestinal inflammation is complex and does not appear to reflect a simple cause 
      and effect. Similarly, the field of probiotics is complex and in need of rigorous
      research. Until the indigenous flora are better characterized and mechanisms of
      probiotic action defined, the promise of probiotics in IBD is unlikely to be
      fulfilled. Because of strain-specific variability and clinical and therapeutic
      heterogeneity within Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, it cannot be assumed
      that a given probiotic is equally suitable for all individuals. Although
      preliminary results of probiotic therapy in animal models and humans with
      ulcerative colitis and pouchitis have been encouraging, their efficacy in
      treatment or maintenance of remission of Crohn's disease remains to be clarified.
      However, the circumstantial evidence for some form of biotherapeutic modification
      of the enteric flora in Crohn's disease seems compelling. In the future,
      probiotics may offer a simple adjunct to conventional therapy with the emphasis
      on diet shifting from one of nutritional replenishment alone to a more functional
      role.

TI  - Allergy and the gut.
PG  - 270-83
AB  - There have frequently been doubts as to the relevance of food allergy, in
      particular as far as the involvement of the intestinal tract is concerned.
      Several studies, however, have confirmed the existence of allergic reactions in
      the gut, with an estimated prevalence of about 1-2% in adults. Clinical symptoms 
      are unspecific and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, cramping and
      diarrhea. Intestinal mast cells, as well as intestinal eosinophils, have been
      shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of food-allergy-related enteropathy. In 
      addition to classical IgE-dependent degranulation, further agonists have been
      demonstrated for mast cell activation, for example IL-4. The methods used to
      confirm the diagnosis of intestinal allergy are still insufficient. Until now,
      blinded oral challenge procedures with food antigens have been accepted as the
      'gold standard' in diagnosing food allergy, although these tests have practical
      problems. Therefore, new test systems have been developed, such as endoscopic
      provocation tests, that may improve diagnostic procedures. Elimination diet still
      presents the main basis of therapy. Aspects to be focused on in the future are
      the role fo IgE-independent allergic mechanisms in intestinal allergy, the impact
      of cross-reactivity with other allergens and the relationship to other
      inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac
      disease and irritable bowel syndrome.

TI  - Food induced stimulation of the antisecretory factor can improve symptoms in
      human inflammatory bowel disease: a study of a concept.
PG  - 824-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antisecretory factor (AF), a 41 kDa cloned and sequenced protein,
      suppresses intestinal inflammation and hypersecretion in animals. Endogenous AF
      production can be induced by dietary modifications in several animal species, and
      this feed has been shown to reduce the incidence of diarrhoeal disease in weaning
      piglets. The role of AF in intestinal disease in humans is not known. AIMS: To
      study the effects of hydrothermally processed cereals, optimised for AF induction
      in animals, added to the diet of patients with longstanding symptoms of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). PATIENTS: Fifty three patients with IBD
      (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) were entered into the study, and 50
      completed follow up. The experimental group consisted of 16 females (mean age 50 
      (SEM 5) years) and 10 males (41 (4) years) and the placebo group of 12 women (41 
      (4) years old) and 12 men (51 (5) years). METHODS: Patients were randomised to
      receive either hydrothermally processed cereals (active treatment) or the same
      amount of ordinary cereals (placebo treatment) for four weeks in a double blind
      study design. Baseline diet and medications remained unchanged. Bowel symptoms,
      plasma levels of AF, and colonic biopsies were evaluated before and after
      treatment. RESULTS: The active treatment significantly improved subjective
      ratings of clinical symptoms and increased plasma AF levels compared with
      placebo. Plasma lipid levels were unaffected. CONCLUSION: Hydrothermally
      processed cereals can induce AF production in human IBD. This increase in
      endogenous AF activity is associated with clinical improvement. Further studies
      are warranted to clarify the exact role of AF in human intestinal disease.

TI  - Distal proctocolitis and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs): the mucosal
      effect in situ.
PG  - 68-76
AB  - It has been postulated that patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) have altered
      reactivity of gut-associated lymphoid tissue. In such cases there is intense
      infiltration of the mucosa with immune competent cells and associated tissue
      damage. We have shown previously that the dietary supplementation with the n-3
      polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and
      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) results in significant systemic immune suppression.
      The aim of this study, therefore, was to evaluate the in situ effect of n-3 PUFAs
      on distal proctocolitis. Each patient received either fish oil extract (EPA 3.2
      g, DHA 2.4 g) (n = 9) or sunflower oil (n = 9) daily in a double blind manner for
      six months. Monthly assessment included: (1) disease activity using clinical,
      sigmoidoscopic, and histological scores and (2) immunohistochemical analysis
      (immunoglobulins, CD profiles) of rectal biopsy specimens (before and after six
      months supplementation) using monoclonal antibodies and quantitative
      computer-assisted video image analysis. Prior to receiving supplementation,
      patients with proctocolitis (n = 18) showed significantly higher numbers of cells
      expressing CD3 (pan T cells) and HLA-DR and IgM containing cells compared with
      non-colitic controls (n = 8). Six months supplementation with n-3 PUFAs resulted 
      in significant reduction in the number of cells expressing CD3 and HLA and the
      percentage of cells containing IgM. There was no significant change in the CD20
      nor the percentage of IgG or IgA containing cells in either group of patients
      with procto-colitis. In patients receiving n-3 PUFA supplementation, there was
      improvement in the disease activity and histological scores, compared with
      pretreatment evaluation. This study has demonstrated both evidence of suppression
      of in situ immune reactivity and concurrent reduction in disease activity in
      patients with proctocolitis receiving n-3 PUFA supplementation. This may have
      important implication for therapy in patients with ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Diet as a risk factor for the development of ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1008-13
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Dietary factors have been considered as a possible risk factor for
      ulcerative colitis (UC). However, available data are inconsistent. The aim of the
      present study was to evaluate the etiological role of dietary factors in the
      development of UC. METHODS: Recently diagnosed (<6 Months) UC patients (n = 43)
      and age- and gender-matched population controls (n = 43) were studied in a
      case-control design. The crosscheck dietary history method was used to assess
      dietary intake of 5 yr before the study. Adipose tissue fatty acid composition
      was used as a biomarker of long-term fat intake. Conditional logistic
      regression-derived odds ratios (OR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used 
      for statistical analysis. Dietary intake ORs were adjusted for energy intake.
      RESULTS: High intakes of monounsaturated fat (OR: 33.9 [95% CI 2.6-443.1]),
      polyunsaturated fat (OR: 5.1 [95% CI 1.0-26.7]), and vitamin B6 (OR: 6.9 [95% CI 
      1.6-30.7]) were associated with an increased risk to develop UC. No other
      significant associations were found with UC risk. CONCLUSIONS: High intakes of
      mono- and polyunsaturated fat and vitamin B6 may enhance the risk of developing
      UC. Whether this observation is a true risk factor in the development of UC or
      rather a reflection of a certain dietary lifestyle needs to be investigated.

TI  - Will recommended changes in fat and fibre intake affect cholesterol absorption
      and sterol excretion? An ileostomy study.
PG  - 306-13
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study cholesterol absorption and excretion in ileostomy subjects
      with different intakes of saturated fat and dietary fibre. DESIGN: Short-term
      experimental study, with four controlled diets in repeated measurements. SETTING:
      Out-patients at metabolic-ward kitchen. SUBJECTS: Nine healthy volunteers with
      conventional ileostomy after colectomy because of ulcerative colitis.
      INTERVENTIONS: Four diet periods, each of 3 days duration: high saturated fat and
      low dietary fibre (STAND); reduced saturated fat (RESAT); high saturated fat and 
      high fibre (FATFIB); and reduced saturated fat and high fibre (RESATFIB). MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Absorption of cholesterol, and ileal excretion of cholesterol, 
      bile acids, fat and energy. Differences between diets evaluated with Friedman's
      two-way analysis of variance by rank sum with Bonferroni adjustment, and post hoc
      differences assessed by rank sum comparison. RESULTS: RESAT and RESATFIB reduced 
      fractional cholesterol absorption by 7% and 10%; RESATFIB and FATFIB increased
      net cholesterol excretion by 46% and 54% respectively. Further, RESATFIB
      increased net sterol excretion by 18%, all compared to STAND (P<0.05 for all).
      All three intervention diets contained more phytosterols than STAND (P<0.05), and
      the phytosterol content was inversely correlated to fractional cholesterol
      absorption (r=-0.77, P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Current nutrition recommendations to
      reduce saturated fat and increase dietary fibre affect sterol excretion
      additively. The effect on cholesterol absorption might be partly explained by the
      content of dietary plant sterols. SPONSORSHIP: Supported by grants from the
      Gothenburg Medical Society, grant numbers 94/086 and 99/082, and by the

TI  - Soy sterol esters and beta-sitostanol ester as inhibitors of cholesterol
      absorption in human small bowel.
PG  - 908-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plant sterols are natural dietary components with serum
      cholesterol-lowering properties. The lowering of serum cholesterol by plant
      sterols is believed to be the result of an inhibition of cholesterol absorption
      in the small bowel, although increased bile acid excretion has also been
      suggested. The difference in effect of saturated and unsaturated plant sterols on
      cholesterol absorption needs to be elucidated further. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim
      of this study was to measure small-bowel cholesterol absorption and sterol
      excretion in addition to hepatic cholesterol synthesis after intake of soy sterol
      esters and beta-sitostanol ester corresponding to 1.5 g plant sterols/d. DESIGN: 
      Seven ileostomy subjects were studied during a control period and 2 intervention 
      periods when either soy sterol esters or beta-sitostanol ester was added to a
      basal diet. Ileostomy bags were collected every other hour and frozen immediately
      for analysis of nutrients and sterols. RESULTS: Cholesterol absorption was 56%
      (43-65%) in the control period and decreased to 38% (32-46%) in the soy sterol
      ester period (P = 0.00) and to 39% (30-48%) in the beta-sitostanol ester period
      (P = 0.00). CONCLUSION: Esterified soy sterols and beta-sitostanol inhibited
      cholesterol absorption equally, despite the different structures of the plant
      sterols.

TI  - A new method for the determination of sulphide in gastrointestinal contents and
      whole blood by microdistillation and ion chromatography.
PG  - 115-25
AB  - Hydrogen sulphide is produced in the human large intestine by the bacterial
      reduction of dietary inorganic sulphate and sulphite and by fermentation of
      sulphur amino acids. Sulphide may damage the colonic epithelium and has been
      implicated in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. The accurate measurement of
      sulphide in biological samples, particularly in gut contents is difficult due to 
      the volatile nature of the compound, and the viscosity and turbidity of the
      samples. Here we describe a method for the determination of sulphide in gut
      contents and whole blood which overcomes these problems. Initially, samples are
      treated with zinc acetate to trap sulphide. A microdistillation pretreatment is
      then used, which releases sulphide from its stable, stored state, coupled to ion 
      chromatography with electrochemical detection. The limit of detection of the
      method was determined as 2.5 micromol/l, which enabled sulphide levels in gut
      contents and whole blood samples obtained from humans to be accurately
      determined. A preliminary investigation in healthy human subjects showed blood
      sulphide ranged from 10 to 100 micromol/l. Whole blood sulphide did not change
      significantly when increasing amounts of protein from meat were fed. However,
      faecal sulphide did show a significant increase from 164 to 754 nmol/g in four
      subjects fed diets which contained 60 and 420 g meat.

TI  - Etiology and pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease--environmental
      factors.
PG  - 29-43
AB  - Environmental factors play an important role in the pathophysiology of
      inflammatory bowel disease. There is a strong and consistent association between 
      smoking and Crohn's disease, and between nonsmoking and ulcerative colitis.
      Despite extensive research, the exact pathophysiological mechanisms for these
      associations remain unclear. In spite of this, some clinical trials with
      nicotine-patches showed beneficial effects for the treatment of ulcerative
      colitis. Associations of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis with other
      environmental factors are weaker like the association with use of oral
      contraceptives or those less well investigated such as the association with
      childhood hygiene. Most studies suggesting a potential pathogenetic role of
      Mycobacterium paratuberculosis or an effect of tuberculostatic therapy in Crohn's
      disease could not be reproduced by others. Perinatal or childhood infections by
      viruses like measles are heavily debated, but not proven to be causal for
      inflammatory bowel disease. Coagulation disorders have been described as
      protecting from inflammatory bowel disease, suggesting hypercoagulability to be a
      pathogenetic factor. Some studies described that appendectomy may prevent the
      onset of ulcerative colitis in man and mice. Other environmental factors such as 
      hydrogen sulfide, tonsillectomy, diet, blood transfusions, and Listeria also
      require confirmation. There are, however, convincing data from genetic animal
      models and twin studies that environmental factors as the intestinal bacterial
      flora interact with susceptible hosts to cause inflammatory bowel disease.
      Inflammatory bowel diseases have multifactorial etiologies, which require a
      differentiated approach for treatment and prevention.

TI  - Patient knowledge and educational needs in irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 39-43
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Educating patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) about their
      disorder may promote a strong physician-patient interaction, is a recommended
      approach for treating mild IBS and may reduce healthcare use. Our aim was to
      identify the information needs, levels and associated factors in IBS, and to
      contrast this with patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). DESIGN:
      Seventy adult IBS patients (Rome criteria) were prospectively recruited, together
      with 82 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 60 Crohn's disease (CD) patients. Demographic
      data, clinical data, and anxiety and depression scores (HAD scale) were recorded.
      Patients rated their perceived levels of disease knowledge and satisfaction with 
      their knowledge level on visual analogue scales. Qualitative data on disease
      information needs were obtained by an open-ended question. SETTING:
      Gastroenterology out-patient clinic. RESULTS: The majority of IBS patients (77%; 
      n = 54) and over half of IBD patients (56%; n = 79) required further information 
      about their disease. The primary issues for IBS patients were bowel cancer risk
      and diet. Queries about medications ranked top for UC, while prognosis and cancer
      risk jointly ranked top for CD. In the IBS group, 27% rated their knowledge as < 
      25 out of 100 compared to 10% of IBD patients. The perceived level of knowledge
      in IBS was significantly negatively associated with length of hospital consulting
      (r(s) = -0.32; P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Most IBS patients feel insufficiently
      informed, particularly in relation to risk of serious disease and role of diet.
      Educating IBS patients about their disorder may play a role in reducing
      healthcare use.

TI  - Immune potentiation of ultrafine dietary particles in normal subjects and
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 99-105
AB  - Various specific and non-specific environmental factors have been associated with
      the induction and/or exacerbation of disease activity in patients with Crohn's
      disease and ulcerative colitis. One such factor is the potential role of ingested
      ultrafine particles. In fact, based on a Western diet, recent data suggest that
      more than 10(12)ultrafine particles are ingested per person every day. These
      microparticles have been considered inert although they adsorb endogenous
      constituents of the intestinal lumen and are taken up by human intestinal
      lymphoid aggregates. Based on these observations, we determined whether one such 
      dietary microparticle, titanium dioxide (TiO(2)), alters intestinal cell
      responsiveness to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) using colonic biopsy specimens from 28
      patients with ulcerative colitis, 21 with Crohn's disease, and 36 healthy
      controls. These samples, as well as peripheral blood mononuclear cells when
      available, were incubated alone (control), or with either (a) LPS (1-2,000
      ng/ml), (b) TiO(2)(5 microg/ml) or (c) LPS (1 ng/ml) adsorbed to TiO(2)(5
      microg/ml). In each case, the levels of interleukin 1 (IL-1) produced in these
      assays were quantitated by bioassay and by ELISA. Interestingly, there was
      dramatic stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells using the TiO(2)-LPS
      conjugate, with values 30-60-fold above controls and only minor stimulation with 
      LPS or TiO(2)alone. In intestinal organ cultures there was no increase in IL-1
      secretion when challenged with TiO(2)alone or with up to 2,000 ng/ml LPS.
      However, the TiO(2)-LPS conjugate produced a two-to-three-fold, significant
      increase in the intestinal secretion of IL-1. Our data demonstrate that ultrafine
      dietary particles are not immunologically inert and may be important adjuncts in 
      overcoming normal gut cell hyporesponsiveness to endogenous luminal molecules.
      This may be particularly relevant to patients with inflammatory bowel disease
      where there is abnormal intestinal permeability.

TI  - Food-induced eosinophilic proctocolitis.
PG  - S58-60
AB  - Food-induced eosinophilic proctocolitis appears in the first 2 months of life
      with blood-tinged stools. Aside from occasional apparent pain on defecation and a
      few infants with moderate eczema, systemic features are absent. Indeed, aside
      from the diaper, the infant is generally described as well. Thus, in contrast to 
      the infant with enterocolitis, features such as emesis, failure to thrive,
      significant anemia, and dramatic diarrhea are not seen. In contrast to infants
      with the other food-induced inflammatory diseases of the bowel, most symptomatic 
      infants are exclusively breast fed. Proctoscopic examination reveals focal
      erythema, erosions, and/or the nodularity of lymphoid nodular hyperplasia of the 
      rectosigmoid. Biopsies of the rectum and lower sigmoid reveal a characteristic
      infiltration of the mucosa and lamina propria with eosinophils, usually in excess
      of 6 to 10 per high powered field. Elimination of the offending protein from the 
      diet of the infant, through use of an extensively hydrolyzed casein-based formula
      or the elimination of the protein from the diet of the mother of the
      breast-feeding infant, leads to clinical resolution of the bleeding within 72 to 
      96 hours. By 1 year of age the infants routinely tolerate an unrestricted diet,
      and the long term prognosis is excellent.

TI  - Nutritional therapies for ulcerative colitis: literature review, chart review
      study, and future research.
PG  - 55-63
AB  - Few clinical studies suggest a significant influence of diet or nutritional
      supplementation on ulcerative colitis. One reason is that ulcerative colitis,
      like many chronic diseases, is multifactorial. This article will describe and
      review the relevant literature on ulcerative colitis, including studies of (1)
      diet and intravenous therapy, (2) nutritional status and nutritional
      supplementation, and (3) bowel flora and immune function and their influences.
      Also, results of a retrospective chart review study that was done at a
      complementary medicine office will be presented. Finally, suggestions for future 
      research will be discussed based on a nutritional model of ulcerative colitis.
      Taken together, it is hoped that these areas will clarify the current status of
      ulcerative colitis research and promote the types of investigations that are
      necessary to establish the validity of nutritional influences on ulcerative
      colitis as well as the mechanisms that are involved.

TI  - Polyunsaturated fatty acids and inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 339S-42S
LID - 10.1093/ajcn/71.1.339s [doi]
AB  - The rationale for supplementation with n-3 fatty acids to promote the health of
      the gastrointestinal tract lies in the antiinflammatory effects of these lipid
      compounds. The first evidence of the importance of dietary intake of n-3
      polyunsaturated fatty acids was derived from epidemiologic observations of the
      low incidence of inflammatory bowel disease in Eskimos. The aim of this paper was
      to briefly review the literature on the use of n-3 fatty acids in inflammatory
      bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease), the results of which are
      controversial. The discrepancies between studies may reside in the different
      study designs used as well as in the various formulations and dosages used, some 
      of which may lead to a high incidence of side effects. Choosing a formulation
      that lowers the incidence of side effects, selecting patients carefully, and
      paying strict attention to experimental design are critical when investigating
      further the therapeutic potential of these lipids in inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Lymphocytic colitis, induced by ticlopidine.
PG  - 1105-8
AB  - Lymphocytic colitis is a chronic inflammatory colonic disease characterized by
      watery diarrhea and a dense infiltration of the colonic mucosa with lymphocytes. 
      The etiology is unknown but an immune reaction to various immunostimulatory
      agents including pathogenic or commensal bacteria, products of bacterial
      metabolism of dietary degradation, or antigens derived directly from the diet,
      and autoimmune phenomena are discussed. We observed a patient with all features
      of lymphocytic colitis characterized by a prominent intraepithelial T-cell
      component. The colitis resolved completely when therapy with ticlopidine--an
      agent inhibiting platelet aggregation--was stopped. This observation suggests
      that medical history concerning drug ingestion may reveal the etiology of
      lymphocytic colitis and allows cure of this otherwise difficult to treat
      disorder.

TI  - [Life situation of patients with ileoanal anastomosis].
PG  - 3892-5
AB  - Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is an alternative to ileostomy for patients with
      ulcerative colitis. Results of a questionnaire survey answered by 155 patients
      organised in a support group are presented. Consequences of the operation were
      mainly faecal incontinence, experienced by half of the group in the daytime, and 
      frequent defaecations (5-7 per day, 1-2 per night). One half of the patients used
      medication every day to decrease the number of defaecations. 64% had changed
      their diet, while social and physical activities were reduced for 43% of the
      patients. Changes in lifestyle after the operation lead to increased expenses for
      70% of the group. Women were more often incontinent than men and experienced it
      as a serious problem, and more women than men had changed their dietary habits.
      The quality of sleep was inferior to that of the preoperative period for 47% of
      the patients. 50% felt restricted in daily life activities due to frequent
      defaecations. These patients are living with a concealed disability. In spite of 
      this, their assessments of self-esteem, health and quality of life were mainly
      positive.

TI  - [Nutritional therapy for ulcerative colitis].
PG  - 2472-5
AB  - Despite its supplementary role for a remedy of the Ulcerative Colitis,
      nutritional therapy performs the important role as well as medicine. In the
      active state, the aim of nutrition therapy is to reduce the activity of the
      disease. In the remission state, the aim is to keep the condition and to supply
      elements of nutrition which the disease causes these deficiency such as vitamins 
      or minerals. Needless to say, it is required to consider a few points; patient's 
      condition, lesion's digestion disorder and leakage, or side effects of caused by 
      medicines. High calorie, low fat and rich protein is ideal for the nutrition
      therapy for this disease, however it is suggested to satisfy patient's mental
      health at the same time. Nutrition therapy for Ulcerative Colitis should be
      regarded as the long-term treatment that requires the co-operation and
      comprehension between patients and medical supporting staffs.

TI  - [Medical therapy in ulcerative colitis].
PG  - 2466-71
AB  - Salazosulfapyridine(SASP) and 5-aminosalicyclic acid(5-ASA) are useful in the
      therapy of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. 5-ASA lacks sulfa
      moiety of SASP and is associated with a decreased incidence of side effects. In
      patients with moderate or severe ulcerative colitis, glucocorticoids which may be
      given in conjunction with SASP or 5-ASA are beneficial in producing remission.
      Proctitis or left-sided colitis is effectively treated with glucocorticoid
      enemas. If symptoms are refractory to outpatient management, the patient should
      be hospitalized and given initial therapy with glucocorticoids. Total
      colectomy(ileo-anal anastomosis; IAA et al) must be considered for acutely ill
      patients not responding to intensive medical therapy. Early surgical consultation
      is necessary in severely ill patients.

TI  - Cow's milk enteropathy: surgical pitfalls.
PG  - 1486-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cow's milk-induced intestinal bleeding is a well-recognized cause of 
      rectal bleeding in infancy. The authors report on 5 older children who presented 
      with either visible rectal bleeding or profound anemia associated with occult
      intestinal bleeding secondary to cow's milk enteropathy. METHODS: Five children
      (3 boys and 2 girls) aged between 20 months and 9 years were referred for further
      investigation of gastrointestinal bleeding. Two had been investigated previously 
      on multiple occasions, and both had undergone laparotomies with negative results.
      Further investigations showed evidence of allergic colitis in 3 detected only on 
      proximal colonic biopsy findings. RESULTS: In all cases, bleeding resolved
      completely after instituting a cow's milk-free diet. Two of the patients
      subsequently have undergone a cow's milk challenge leading to prompt recurrence
      of symptoms, which again resolved after simple dietary manipulation. CONCLUSIONS:
      Cow's milk enteropathy may cause overt rectal bleeding or profound anemia from
      occult intestinal bleeding even in older children. Histological abnormalities in 
      such cases may be confined to the proximal colon. After appropriate
      investigation, a trial of cow's milk exclusion should always be considered before
      laparotomy for obscure, chronic gastrointestinal bleeding in children.

PG  - 71S-80S
AB  - Energy-protein malnutrition and the sub-clinical deficiencies of vitamins and
      trace elements, are frequent findings in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, 
      and these may negatively influence the clinical course of these diseases. In
      general, the majority of the patients with ulcerative colitis and uncomplicated
      Crohn's disease can ingest a normal diet that is well balanced and without any
      restrictions. The intolerance to specific foods is rare in Crohn's disease and
      the application of exclusion diets in a routine manner is not indicated. When the
      nutritional status cannot be adequately maintained with normal ingestion, the use
      of artificial nutrition is indicated. Enteral nutrition is the first choice
      nutritional support system if the gastrointestinal tract is accessible and at
      least partially functional. In Crohn's disease enteral nutrition could have a
      specific anti-inflammatory effect ("primary treatment"), and it has been
      suggested that this could be effective to induce the clinical remission of the
      activity bouts of the disease. Some types of dietary fiber could be effective in 
      the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Initial studies suggest their usefulness in 
      maintaining the remission of the disease.

TI  - The role of total parenteral nutrition in the management of patients with acute
      attacks of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 270-5
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the prolonged duration of
      total parenteral nutrition (TPN) on the clinical, laboratory, and nutritional
      parameters and short-term outcome in acute attacks of ulcerative colitis and
      Crohn's colitis, and the difference in the response to TPN between the two
      diseases. Twenty-two patients with severely and moderately active ulcerative
      colitis (8 severe and 14 moderate) and 12 patients with Crohn's colitis were
      analyzed retrospectively. Eleven of 22 patients with ulcerative colitis were
      treated with TPN and corticosteroids (TPN group). The remaining 11 patients were 
      treated with corticosteroids alone and hospital meals (oral diet group). Both
      groups were matched regarding disease severity at pretreatment. The clinical
      characteristics, and the initial and total dosages of corticosteroids for 3 weeks
      were similar between the two groups. The authors compared the changes in the
      clinical, inflammatory, and nutritional parameters and short-term outcome between
      the TPN and the oral diet groups with ulcerative colitis. The same evaluations
      were also made for 12 patients with Crohn's colitis who received TPN (CD group). 
      The TPN group did not show any significant improvement in the clinical parameter,
      inflammatory signs, or nutritional state compared with the oral diet group with
      ulcerative colitis. The remission rate after 3 weeks of therapy and a colectomy
      rate also showed no significant difference between the two groups. In contrast,
      TPN resulted in a disappearance of clinical symptoms and an improvement in both
      the inflammatory and nutritional parameters in the CD group. Only one of the 12
      patients with Crohn's colitis underwent colectomy. TPN induced no additional
      benefit in corticosteroid therapy in an acute attack of ulcerative colitis. In
      contrast, TPN may have primary effects on Crohn's colitis.

TI  - Mesenteric blood flow is related to disease activity and risk of relapse in
      ulcerative colitis: a prospective follow up study.
PG  - 546-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: The diagnostic significance of increased splanchnic blood flow in
      ulcerative colitis is unclear. This prospective study was therefore undertaken to
      define the role of Doppler sonography in the assessment of disease activity and
      in the prediction of early relapse. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Splanchnic flowmetry was
      performed in 76 patients with ulcerative colitis (47 with active disease and 29
      in remission), six with infectious colitis, and 13 healthy controls during
      fasting and 30 minutes after ingestion of a standardised meal. Twenty seven of
      the patients with ulcerative colitis and all patients with infectious colitis
      were investigated during the active state as well as in clinical remission and
      followed up for six months. Flow velocity and pulsatility index (PI) of the
      superior (SMA) and inferior (IMA) mesenteric arteries and the portal vein were
      related to clinical (Truelove index), laboratory (C-reactive protein), and
      endoscopic (Sutherland index) parameters of disease activity. RESULTS: The mean
      flow velocity of the IMA correlated closest with clinical activity (Truelove, r =
      0.41, p<0.005), the PI with C-reactive protein (r = 0.30, p<0.05), and endoscopic
      activity (r = 0.45, p<0.001). All patients in remission after six months (14/14) 
      or with infectious colitis (6/6) showed an increase in PI of the IMA compared
      with the initial measurement during active disease (mean increase for ulcerative 
      colitis +36% and for infectious colitis +77%). In contrast, most patients with
      later relapse or surgery (11/13) had decreased PI during initial remission (mean 
      decrease -12%). The positive predictive value of this index for maintenance of
      remission was 0.77. Flow variables of the SMA and portal vein displayed weaker
      correlations. CONCLUSIONS: Flow measurements in the IMA are closely related to
      clinical and endoscopic disease activity in patients with ulcerative colitis.
      Repeated measurement of the PI allows estimation of the risk of recurrence.

TI  - Physiological and anti-inflammatory roles of dietary fiber and butyrate in
      intestinal functions.
PG  - S70-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated the effects of pectin, a soluble dietary fiber, on
      the morphological parameters of the small intestine. In addition, we tested the
      effects of butyrate enemas on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced experimental
      colitis. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were fed an elemental diet containing 2.5%
      pectin for 14 days, and several parameters were then determined. DSS-induced
      colitis was evoked by the oral administration of water containing 3% DSS for 10
      days. The butyrate enema (3 mL of 100 mmol/L butyrate per day) was begun 7 days
      before the DSS treatment. Interleukin (IL)-8 secretion in the human intestinal
      epithelial cell line HT-29 was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
      (ELISA). RESULTS: Pectin feeding induced a significant increase in the villus
      height and crypt depth in the small intestine. These effects correlated with a
      significant increase in plasma enteroglucagon levels. Pretreatment with a
      butyrate enema significantly blocked the development of DSS-induced experimental 
      colitis. In the in vitro experiment, sodium butyrate dose-dependently inhibited
      tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced IL-8 secretion in HT-29 cells.
      CONCLUSIONS: A trophic effect due to dietary fiber was directly observed. The
      generation of short-chain fatty acids and the induction of enteroglucagon release
      might play an important role in this process. Butyrate, one of the major
      metabolites of dietary fiber, exerted a potent anti-inflammatory effect both in
      vivo and in vitro. Dietary fiber may therefore play important roles in the
      regulation of normal and pathological conditions in the intestine.

TI  - Essential fatty acids in health and chronic disease.
PG  - 560S-569S
LID - 10.1093/ajcn/70.3.560s [doi]
AB  - Human beings evolved consuming a diet that contained about equal amounts of n-3
      and n-6 essential fatty acids. Over the past 100-150 y there has been an enormous
      increase in the consumption of n-6 fatty acids due to the increased intake of
      vegetable oils from corn, sunflower seeds, safflower seeds, cottonseed, and
      soybeans. Today, in Western diets, the ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids ranges
      from approximately 20-30:1 instead of the traditional range of 1-2:1. Studies
      indicate that a high intake of n-6 fatty acids shifts the physiologic state to
      one that is prothrombotic and proaggregatory, characterized by increases in blood
      viscosity, vasospasm, and vasoconstriction and decreases in bleeding time. n-3
      Fatty acids, however, have antiinflammatory, antithrombotic, antiarrhythmic,
      hypolipidemic, and vasodilatory properties. These beneficial effects of n-3 fatty
      acids have been shown in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease,
      hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and, in some patients with renal disease,
      rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease, and chronic obstructive 
      pulmonary disease. Most of the studies were carried out with fish oils
      [eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)]. However,
      alpha-linolenic acid, found in green leafy vegetables, flaxseed, rapeseed, and
      walnuts, desaturates and elongates in the human body to EPA and DHA and by itself
      may have beneficial effects in health and in the control of chronic diseases.

TI  - The relationship between habits of food consumption and reported reactions to
      food in people with inflammatory bowel disease--testing the limits.
PG  - 69-83
AB  - Anecdotally, people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) report that some foods 
      make them feel better and some foods make them feel worse. This paper reports
      about the relationship between food habits and reactions to foods in people with 
      IBD. A database was designed to incorporate the date of data collection, the IBD 
      disease, food habits, the quantity consumed and a response rating of the
      subjects' reactions to each food. For each of 122 foods, subjects were asked
      simultaneously about these five categories. Thirty three subjects with Crohn's
      disease and 27 with ulcerative colitis completed the questionnaire in two
      seasons. The focus of the examination was directed to the upper and lower limit
      of reactions to foods. Foods that affect people negatively and foods that affect 
      people positively were identified in relation to habits of consumption. Foods
      that affect people negatively were among those never consumed while foods that
      affect people positively were among the regularly consumed foods. Findings
      included an increased number of foods that caused problems for people with
      Crohn's disease when compared with people with ulcerative colitis. Problems with 
      chocolate, dairy products, fats and artificial sweeteners were documented in both
      groups of IBD. A standard food list generated without the input of individuals
      with a chronic illness may be inadequate to collect data about their consumption 
      since many of the foods on the list were reportedly never consumed and there may 
      be other foods not on the list that are consumed by this chronically ill
      population.

TI  - Bone mineral metabolism in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 192-9
AB  - The development of reliable techniques to measure bone densitometry and evolving 
      effective drug treatment have kindled great interest in the diagnosis and
      treatment of osteoporosis in adults with inflammatory bowel disease. A number of 
      studies have examined the prevalence of abnormal bone mineral metabolism in
      children and adolescents. Studies, conducted over the past decade, indicate a
      greater likelihood of clinically significant problems in Crohn's disease than in 
      ulcerative colitis. Corticosteroids have been proven to impair bone mineral
      status. It is increasingly clear that inflammation and other factors play a
      bigger role than malabsorbtion of minerals or vitamin D in most patients. As the 
      use of the bisphonate class of drugs is limited in pediatric patients, there is a
      need to emphasize the role of diet and exercise in children and teenagers,
      particularly in those affected by inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Intraluminal pH of the human gastrointestinal tract.
PG  - 183-96
AB  - After a short introduction (chapter 1) methods of measuring gastrointestinal pH
      are described in chapter 2. The methods are divided into intubation techniques
      and tubeless methods, and the advantages and disadvantages are discussed.
      Measurements with pH-sensitive, radiotransmitting capsules are highlighted, and
      methodological problems with these capsules are described. Chapter 3 concerns the
      gastrointestinal pH profile of healthy subjects. The intraluminal pH is rapidly
      changed from highly acid in the stomach to about pH 6 in the duodenum. The pH
      gradually increases in the small intestine from pH 6 to about pH 7.4 in the
      terminal ileum. The pH drops to 5.7 in the caecum, but again gradually increases,
      reaching pH 6.7 in the rectum. The physiological background of these pH values is
      discussed. Chapter 4 describes the effect of gastrointestinal pH on bacterial
      flora, absorption of vitamins and electrolytes, and on the activity of digestive 
      enzymes. The pH-profile in children is described in chapter 5. The profile is
      identical with that of adults, and it is therefore concluded that the release of 
      a drug from pH-dependent, controlled-release preparations is also probably
      identical with that of adults. Chapter 6 describes the correlation between
      certain diseases and the gastrointestinal pH. A resection of the colon and the
      creation of an ileostomy do not affect the pH of the remaining gut. An ileocaecal
      resection shortens the small intestinal transit time, increases pH of the
      proximal colon, but does not change the pH-profile of the small intestine.
      Chronic pancreatitis and cystic fibrosis seem to decrease pH of the proximal
      small intestine. Very low colonic pH values have been observed in severe active
      ulcerative colitis and in Crohn's disease, but the background and clinical
      implication of this phenomenon are not clear. Chapter 7 describes the modulating 
      effect of diet and drugs on gastrointestinal pH. Diet primarily has an effect on 
      the colonic pH, whereas drugs might affect both small intestinal and colonic pH. 
      The different effects are described. Finally, chapter 8 summarizes the present
      knowledge about gastrointestinal pH, and future investigations are proposed.

PG  - 423-43, ix
AB  - This article reviews the nutritional aspects of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) 
      including the mechanisms and manifestations of malnutrition and the efficacy of
      nutritional therapies. Nutrient deficiencies in patients with IBD occur via
      several mechanisms and may complicate the course of the disease. Nutritional
      status is assessed by clinical examination and the use of nutritional indices
      such as the Subjective Global Assessment of nutritional status. Nutritional
      intervention may improve outcome in certain individuals; however, because of the 
      costs and complications of such therapy, careful selection is warranted,
      especially in patients presumed to need parenteral nutrition.

AB  - CD and UC represent a spectrum of chronic IBD that present in protean ways and
      are accompanied by a variety of systemic sequelae. Sulfasalazine and the newer
      5-aminosalicylates are important in the management of mild-to-moderate disease,
      whereas corticosteroids remain the primary therapy for most patients with
      moderate-to-severe disease (Tables 2-5). The toxicities associated with long-term
      steroid therapy, combined with their ineffectiveness as maintenance medications, 
      have led to increased use of immunomodulators, such as azathioprine and 6-MP, for
      the treatment of steroid-dependent and steroid-resistant IBD. Infliximab is a
      novel therapeutic adjunct for chronically active and fistulizing CD that will
      herald a new era of biologic therapy for IBD. Meanwhile, CSA remains an
      alternative to urgent colectomy in severe UC unresponsive to corticosteroids and 
      also for CD patients with severe disease or refractory fistulas. Finally,
      continued insights into the etiopathogenic pathways in IBD will provide evolving 
      and innovative approaches until the eventual causes and cures are elucidated. In 
      the meantime, clinicians should remain optimistic regarding current ability to
      reduce the morbidity and maintain the quality of life for patients suffering with
      these frustrating diseases.

TI  - Randomized clinical trial of Plantago ovata seeds (dietary fiber) as compared
      with mesalamine in maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis. Spanish Group for
      the Study of Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis (GETECCU).
PG  - 427-33
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Butyrate enemas may be effective in the treatment of active distal
      ulcerative colitis. Because colonic fermentation of Plantago ovata seeds (dietary
      fiber) yields butyrate, the aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and
      safety of Plantago ovata seeds as compared with mesalamine in maintaining
      remission in ulcerative colitis. METHODS: An open label, parallel-group,
      multicenter, randomized clinical trial was conducted. A total of 105 patients
      with ulcerative colitis who were in remission were randomized into groups to
      receive oral treatment with Plantago ovata seeds (10 g b.i.d.), mesalamine (500
      mg t.i.d.), and Plantago ovata seeds plus mesalamine at the same doses. The
      primary efficacy outcome was maintenance of remission for 12 months. RESULTS: Of 
      the 105 patients, 102 were included in the final analysis. After 12 months,
      treatment failure rate was 40% (14 of 35 patients) in the Plantago ovata seed
      group, 35% (13 of 37) in the mesalamine group, and 30% (nine of 30) in the
      Plantago ovata plus mesalamine group. Probability of continued remission was
      similar (Mantel-Cox test, p = 0.67; intent-to-treat analysis). Therapy effects
      remained unchanged after adjusting for potential confounding variables with a
      Cox's proportional hazards survival analysis. Three patients were withdrawn
      because of the development of adverse events consisting of constipation and/or
      flatulence (Plantago ovata seed group = 1 and Plantago ovata seed plus mesalamine
      group = 2). A significant increase in fecal butyrate levels (p = 0.018) was
      observed after Plantago ovata seed administration. CONCLUSIONS: Plantago ovata
      seeds (dietary fiber) might be as effective as mesalamine to maintain remission
      in ulcerative colitis.

      disease activity. METHODS: Twenty-three children with Crohn's disease, 14 with
      ulcerative colitis, and 22 age-matched control subjects entered the study.
      Radioimmunoassay and sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay techniques were
      used to measure eosinophilic cationic protein, total immunoglobulin G and
      interleukin-1beta, respectively. RESULTS: Gut lavage eosinophilic cationic
      protein levels were significantly (p < 0.005) higher in patients with Crohn's
      disease and ulcerative colitis than in control subjects. Intestinal eosinophilic 
      cationic protein levels decreased in three of four children with Crohn's disease 
      who were fed an elemental diet. There was a significant (p < 0.001) correlation
      between eosinophilic cationic protein concentrations and immunoglobulin G and
      interleukin-1beta levels in gut lavage fluid. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated intestinal
      eosinophilic cationic protein levels in inflammatory bowel disease suggest that
      eosinophils are involved in the gastrointestinal inflammation in this disease.
      Intestinal eosinophilic cationic protein concentration is another marker with
      which to discriminate between active and inactive inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Allergic colitis: a mimic of Hirschsprung disease.
PG  - 37-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: Allergy to cow milk protein is a common cause of gastrointestinal
      symptoms in infancy. Milk allergy is usually a clinical diagnosis, and thus there
      have been few reports of the radiographic findings. OBJECTIVE: To describe the
      barium enema findings of allergic colitis and differentiate them from
      Hirschsprung disease. Materials and methods. Four infants (age range 7 days-5
      weeks) with constipation underwent barium enema to exclude Hirschsprung disease. 
      Radiographic findings were correlated with the pathologic specimens from suction 
      rectal biopsy. RESULTS: All enemas revealed irregular narrowing of the rectum and
      a transition zone. Rectal biopsies in each case demonstrated ganglion cells and
      evidence of an allergic colitis, with inflammatory infiltrates in the lamina
      propria. A diagnosis of milk allergy colitis was made and symptoms resolved after
      removal of milk from the diet. CONCLUSIONS: Milk allergy is common in infancy.
      The rectum is a primary target organ, with allergic colitis often diagnosed on
      clinical grounds alone. However, a child with allergic colitis may be referred to
      radiology for barium enema, especially if constipation is present. The
      radiologist should be aware of the unique imaging findings of allergic colitis,
      so as to avoid confusion with Hirschsprung disease and perhaps an unnecessary
      rectal biopsy.
