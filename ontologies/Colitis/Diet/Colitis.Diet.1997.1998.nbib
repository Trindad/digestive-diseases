TI  - What is the association of primary sclerosing cholangitis with sex and
      inflammatory bowel disease in Turkish patients?
PG  - 2064-72
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: In the Western world, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a 
      chronic cholestatic liver disease that is associated with inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD), particularly chronic ulcerative colitis and, to a lesser degree,
      Crohn's disease. The goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of PSC in
      Turkish patients with IBD and chronic amebic colitis, a disease that is endemic
      in Turkey. METHODOLOGY: During a 10-year period, between 1986 and 1996, a total
      of 81 IBD (64 ulcerative colitis and 17 Crohn's disease) patients and 127
      patients with chronic amebic colitis were seen and evaluated with radiologic,
      serologic, immunologic and pathologic tests. Whenever a clinical or biochemical
      finding suggested the presence of co-existent hepatic and/or biliary disease, the
      patient was further evaluated by liver biopsy, auto-antibodies and endoscopic
      retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to determine whether they also had PSC
      or some other form of liver disease. As a disease control group, a total of 752
      patients with clinical and/or laboratory evidence of pancreaticobiliary disease
      were also studied. In 86 of these 752 patients (10%), a primary disorder of the
      biliary tree was diagnosed by ultrasonography, computed tomography,
      peritoneoscopy, liver biopsy, ERCP and abdominal laparotomy. In addition, all 86 
      patients of the control group were evaluated endoscopically in order to determine
      whether they had any associated gastrointestinal condition of the upper or lower 
      gastrointestinal tracts. After establishing final diagnoses of IBD, amebic
      colitis and PSC, these patients were evaluated with respect to their
      socio-economic status. A high protein diet (1.8 gram/kg/day) was administered to 
      those patients with chronic amebic colitis and IBD during the active period of
      the disease. RESULTS: Of the 208 patients (81 with IBD and 127 with chronic
      amebic colitis), no cases of PSC were identified. Of the 86 patients in the
      control group with primary biliary tract disease, 45 had a biliary system
      malignancy, 14 had primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), 16 had PSC, 3 had Caroli's
      disease, 6 had a common bile duct cyst, and 2 had gallbladder adenomatosis. All
      but 1 of the 16 patients with PSC were female. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest
      that, in contrast to findings in Western Europe and the USA, in Turkey: 1) PSC is
      not regularly associated with idiopathic IBD; 2) most patients with PSC are
      female; 3) PSC accounts for only 18% of patients with a primary disorder of the
      biliary tree; 4) the incidence of small-duct primary sclerosing cholangitis is
      greater than that reported in the literature; and, 5) the incidence of IBD and
      PSC in Turkey is relatively lower than in other countries.

TI  - Patients' diets and preferences in a pediatric population with inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 544-9
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the dietary practices of the pediatric inflammatory bowel
      disease population at the Children's Hospital of the Hamilton Health Sciences
      Corporation and the reported effectiveness of those diets. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      A questionnaire mailed to 153 pediatric patients was returned by 125 patients (76
      Crohn's disease [CD] and 49 ulcerative colitis [UC] patients)--an 82% response
      rate. RESULTS: The median age of respondents was 13 years, and 62% were male.
      Ninety per cent and 71% of CD and UC patients, respectively, had changed their
      diets since diagnosis. Caloric supplements (eg, BOOST [Mead Johnson
      Nutritionals]), sole source nutrition, low fibre and lactose-free diets were used
      by more than 15% of CD patients, whereas lactose-free, nonspicy, low acid,
      additive-free, caloric supplement and low fibre diets were used by more than 15% 
      of UC patients. A diet supplement was more commonly used in CD patients (P <
      0.05) and an additive-free diet in UC patients. Corn and corn products, nuts,
      milk and bran were avoided by more than 20% of CD and UC patients; however, more 
      CD than UC patients avoided corn and corn products. In addition, UC patients
      (more than 20%) also avoided tomato, other dairy (nonfluid milk-based products
      and foods containing milk products), chocolate, cheese, wheat, tomato sauces and 
      fruit juice. A benefit was reported for 103 of 141 reported diets, with the most 
      commonly alleviated symptoms being abdominal pain, diarrhea and flatulence.
      CONCLUSION: Many children with inflammatory bowel disease have altered their
      diets to manage their disease and have attributed symptomatic relief to these
      diets.

TI  - Treatment of ulcerative colitis with germinated barley foodstuff feeding: a pilot
      study.
PG  - 1225-30
AB  - BACKGROUND: Germinated barley foodstuff (GBF) has been shown to attenuate
      intestinal injury in animal models, largely by increasing luminal short-chain
      fatty acid production. AIM: To investigate the safety and efficacy of GBF in the 
      treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Ten patients with active UC
      received 30 g of GBF daily for 4 weeks in an open-label treatment protocol while 
      the baseline anti-inflammatory therapy was continued. The response to treatment
      was evaluated clinically and endoscopically. Pre- and post-treatment stool
      concentrations of short-chain fatty acids were measured by gas-liquid
      chromatography. RESULTS: Patients showed improvement in their clinical activity
      index scores, with a significant decrease in the score from 6.9+/-1.4 to
      2.8+/-1.5 (mean+/-S.E.M., P < 0.05). The endoscopic index score fell from
      6.1+/-2.3 to 3.8+/-2.3 (P < 0.0001). Patients showed an increase in stool
      butyrate concentrations after GBF treatment (P < 0.05). No side-effects were
      observed. CONCLUSIONS: Oral GBF therapy may have a place in management of
      ulcerative colitis, but controlled studies are needed to demonstrate its efficacy
      in the treatment of this disorder.

TI  - Colonic histopathology in untreated celiac sprue or refractory sprue: is it
      lymphocytic colitis or colonic lymphocytosis?
PG  - 1433-40
AB  - Colonic histopathology in some patients with untreated celiac sprue and
      refractory sprue has been said to be indistinguishable from lymphocytic colitis, 
      but there have been no objective comparisons on which this is based. The purpose 
      of this study was to determine the prevalence and to characterize the nature of
      colonic histopathology at the time of diagnosis in patients with celiac or
      refractory sprue. Colonoscopic biopsy specimens obtained at the time of diagnosis
      from 16 patients with celiac sprue, six patients with refractory sprue, nine
      patients with lymphocytic colitis, and five normal controls were analyzed blindly
      by histological and morphometric methods, quantitating the number and specific
      subtypes of inflammatory cells within the lamina propria and epithelium.
      Immunoperoxidase staining of intraepithelial lymphocytes with a monoclonal
      antibody to CD8 also was performed. Three of 16 patients with untreated celiac
      sprue (19%) were thought to have colonic histological abnormalities, which by
      morphometry consisted of slightly increased numbers of lymphocytes in the surface
      epithelium and lamina propria, many of which were CD8-positive. These
      abnormalities were distinguishable from lymphocytic colitis by the lack of
      increased overall lamina propria cellularity and surface epithelial
      abnormalities, and by fewer intraepithelial lymphocytes. In refractory sprue,
      colonic histological abnormalities were more frequent than in celiac sprue,
      occurring in four of six patients (67%), more pronounced, and identical to those 
      in the lymphocytic colitis syndrome. However, colonic intraepithelial lymphocytes
      in lymphocytic colitis were mostly CD8-positive, whereas those in the colitis of 
      refractory sprue rarely were. Mild colonic lymphocytosis in patients with
      untreated celiac sprue should be distinguished from lymphocytic colitis by the
      lack of surface epithelial abnormalities, the lack of increased cellularity of
      the lamina propria, and the lack of ongoing watery diarrhea after treatment with 
      a gluten-free diet. In contrast, colonic histopathology in refractory sprue is
      indistinguishable from lymphocytic colitis, although immunohistochemical
      differences do exist.

TI  - The influence of a preserved colon on the absorption of medium chain fat in
      patients with small bowel resection.
PG  - 478-83
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medium chain C8-C10 triglycerides (MCTs) improve fat absorption in
      short bowel patients. Effects on overall energy absorption remain unknown. AIMS: 
      To determine whether MCTs and medium chain fatty acids (MCFAs) are absorbed in
      the colon like the short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) or are lost in faeces
      similarly to long chain fatty acids (LCFAs). METHODS: Nine small bowel resected
      patients without and 10 with a colon in continuity excreted 2-6 MJ/day and were
      randomised and crossed over between two high fat diets (10 MJ/day, 50% as fat),
      based on either long chain triglycerides (LCT) alone or equal quantities of LCT
      and MCT. RESULTS: Patients with a colon absorbed C8-C10 fatty acids considerably 
      better than patients without a colon at similar and extreme levels of LCFA
      malabsorption; the colonic impact on absorption of C14-18 fatty acids was
      negligible. MCT redoubled fat (MCT+LCT) absorption from 23% to 58% in patients
      with a colon, and increased overall bomb calorimetric energy absorption from 46% 
      to 58%. The increase in fat absorption from 37% to 46% in patients without a
      colon did not improve overall energy absorption because malabsorption of
      carbohydrate and protein increased. CONCLUSION: In small bowel resected patients,
      the colon seems to serve as a digestive organ for medium chain fat, probably
      absorbed as MCFAs, perhaps because like the SCFAs, they are water soluble. Only
      patients with a colon gained from MCT treatment.

AB  - Many nutritional issues are important in the care of children and adolescents
      with inflammatory bowel disease. No specific dietary toxin or antigen has been
      identified to have an etiologic role in either ulcerative colitis or Crohn's
      disease. A possible modulating effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on
      intestinal inflammation is being investigated. Most prevalent among the
      nutritional consequences of inflammatory bowel disease is weight loss, for which 
      inadequate caloric intake is primarily responsible. Impairment of linear growth
      and associated delay in pubertal development commonly complicate childhood
      Crohn's disease. The two major etiologic factors are chronic undernutrition and
      direct effects of inflammatory mediators secreted from the inflamed gut. Recent
      studies have incriminated interleukin-6. Treatment of intestinal inflammation and
      provision of adequate nutrition are of paramount importance in preventing or
      remedying growth impairment. Exclusive enteral nutrition using formulated food is
      efficacious primary therapy of active Crohn's disease, although the mode of
      action is poorly understood.

TI  - Perioperative growth hormone treatment increases nitrogen and fluid balance and
      results in short-term and long-term conservation of lean tissue mass.
PG  - 840-6
AB  - The surgical procedure for forming an ileoanal anastomosis with a J pouch (IAA)
      usually involves a temporary ileostomy; patients undergoing IAA surgery thus need
      to recover quickly because they return for ileostomy closure 3 mo later. We
      evaluated the effects of perioperative biosynthetic growth hormone (GH) treatment
      on short- and long-term changes in body composition and on nutritional intake.
      Patients with ulcerative colitis undergoing IAA surgery were randomly assigned to
      double-blind treatment with placebo (n=12) or 6 IU GH twice daily (n=12) from 2 d
      before to 7 d after the operation. Examinations were from 2 d before to 9 d after
      the operation and on days 30 and 90. Body composition was assessed with a
      dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanner. The 2 groups had similar nutritional
      intakes. On postoperative day 7, placebo-treated patients had lost 4.2 kg (95%
      CI: 3.0, 5.4) total tissue mass, 3.6 kg (2.1, 5.1) lean tissue mass, and 0.5 kg
      (-0.1, 1.2) fat mass. These reductions persisted 3 mo later. Compared with
      placebo, GH improved nitrogen balance, changes in lean tissue mass [gain of 4.0
      kg (1.9, 6.0), P=0.001], and changes in total tissue mass [gain of 3.2 kg (1.6,
      4.9), P=0.001], but increased the loss of fat mass [loss of 0.7 kg (0.0, 1.5),
      P=0.049] on postoperative day 7. Three months later, the placebo-treated patients
      had lost 2.4 kg (0.7, 4.2) more lean tissue mass than GH-treated patients
      (P=0.009), whereas changes in total tissue and fat mass were not significantly
      different. Hence, GH treatment enhanced the long-term regain of lean tissue mass.

TI  - Preillness non dietary factors and habits in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 247-51
AB  - AIM: Environmental as well as genetic factors play a role in the pathogenesis of 
      inflammatory bowel diseases. The effects of smoking and diet have been
      demonstrated. Other factors have not been extensively investigated. PATIENTS:
      Preillness non dietary habits and factors were studied in 88 patients with recent
      onset of inflammatory bowel diseases (55 with ulcerative colitis and 33 with
      Crohn's disease) and in matched 76 population and 68 clinic controls. RESULTS: No
      significant differences were found in relation to education, housing, birth
      weight, breast feeding in infancy and current weight. The current body mass index
      was significantly lower in patients as compared to clinic controls (p < 0.05).
      More patients had low levels of physical activity during the preillness period as
      compared to controls (p < 0.001 vs clinic controls), while more controls engaged 
      in moderate (p < 0.05) or high levels of physical activity in the corresponding
      periods. Patients spent fewer hours in strenuous physical activity as compared to
      controls (NS). Patients slept fewer hours per day (p < 0.05 vs clinic controls). 
      More patients than controls experienced stressful life events during the year
      prior to onset of symptoms (p < 0.05 for patients with Crohn's disease against
      both controls and all patients vs population controls). CONCLUSIONS: Other
      environmental factors besides smoking and diet may affect the pathogenesis of
      inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Gluten-free diet induces regression of T-cell activation in the rectal mucosa of 
      patients with celiac disease.
PG  - 1527-30
AB  - OBJECTIVE: An increase in the number of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) in the 
      rectal epithelium of patients with active celiac disease has been described. No
      data are available about how they vary during a gluten-free diet. The aim of the 
      study was to assess the effect of a gluten-free diet on T-cell activation in the 
      rectal mucosa of adult patients with celiac disease. METHODS: Frozen duodenal and
      rectal biopsies were available in four celiac patients (one male, three female,
      mean age 39 yr) both before and after 7 to 24 months on a gluten-free diet.
      Biopsy samples were stained using monoclonal antibodies directed against CD3,
      betaF1, TcRdelta1, CD25, and HLADR. Numbers of IEL were estimated by counting the
      peroxidase-stained cells per 100 epithelial cells. Four patients without
      histological abnormalities were used as control subjects. RESULTS: In the four
      patients with active celiac disease but in none of the controls, CD25 was
      expressed by both duodenal and rectal lamina propria cells and HLADR was
      expressed by duodenal (4/4) and rectal (2/4) epithelial cells. In addition, two
      patients with active celiac disease had features of lymphocytic colitis, i.e.,
      >20 IEL per 100 epithelial cells. After a gluten-free diet, the mean number of
      rectal CD3+ betaF1+ IEL decreased (9% vs 21%) and the expression of CD25 and
      HLADR was no longer present. These changes mirrored those found in the small
      intestinal biopsies. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that in celiac disease,
      gluten-driven T-cell activation is not restricted to the proximal part of the
      intestine but is present on the whole intestinal length. Assessment of the
      effectiveness of a gluten-free diet through rectal biopsies warrants
      investigation, as it could lessen discomfort for patients and prove more
      cost-effective.

TI  - Faecal short-chain fatty acids in patients with antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, 
      before and after faecal enema treatment.
PG  - 721-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD) may range from mild
      disturbances to severe pseudomembranous colitis. Many antibiotics affect several 
      intestinal microflora-associated characteristics, such as short-chain fatty acid 
      (SCFA) pattern. In the present study we investigated SCFAs in 31 patients on
      admittance to the hospital for severe AAD. Nine patients were followed up more
      extensively after they had received an enema containing faecal microflora from a 
      healthy person on a Western diet. METHODS: Faecal SCFAs were determined by gas
      chromatography. The enema was characterized before use. RESULTS: AAD patients
      showed significant disturbances in faecal SCFA pattern. Clinically, most
      enema-treated patients recovered within days and had no relapses within 18
      months. CONCLUSIONS: Intestinal microflora showed great disturbances, and the
      amounts of SCFAs were reduced, although the diarrhoea was not related to total
      amount SCFAs. Administration of a faecal enema resulted in the clinical recovery 
      of most patients with severe diarrhoea within 4 days.

TI  - Collagenous colitis and Yersinia enterocolitica infection.
PG  - 1341-6
AB  - Collagenous colitis is a rare clinical and pathological entity characterized by
      watery diarrhea and deposition of collagen beneath the surface epithelium of the 
      colon. Its etiology is unknown. We present a careful retrospective
      clinicopathological analysis of six patients with collagenous colitis diagnosed
      at our hospital during a three-year period. Three of the patients had had a
      Yersinia enterocolitica infection, detected by stool culture and elevated serum
      antibody titers, preceding the diagnosis of collagenous colitis. Four patients
      had duodenal villous atrophy, which in two patients was refractory to a
      gluten-free diet. We propose that Yersinia enterocolitica infection may be a
      triggering factor for the development of collagenous colitis in some cases.
      Duodenal villous atrophy not responding to gluten withdrawal is common in
      association with collagenous colitis.

TI  - Modern life' in the epidemiology of inflammatory bowel disease: a case-control
      study with special emphasis on nutritional factors.
PG  - 243-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The rising incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) since the
      Second World War coincides with profound changes of the dietary pattern. The aim 
      of the study was to investigate the possible pathogenic role of some
      characteristic 'modern life' dietary factors in IBD. DESIGN: Case-control,
      studying risk factors in recently diagnosed cases, 290 with Crohn's disease and
      398 with ulcerative colitis, compared with 616 population controls. Smoking, age,
      gender and education were taken into account by using logistic regression
      analysis. SETTING: Hospital cases and population controls. INTERVENTIONS:
      Questionnaires. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Logistic regression-derived odds ratios.
      RESULTS: A positive association with cola drinks [OR: 2.2 (95% CI 1.5-3.1)],
      chewing gum [OR: 1.5 (95% CI: 1.1-2.1)] and chocolate consumption [OR: 2.5 (95%
      CI: 1.8-3.5)] and a negative association with citrus fruit consumption [OR: 0.5
      (95% CI 0.3-0.7)] and the development of Crohn's disease were found. Consumption 
      of cola drinks [OR: 1.6 (95% CI 1.1-2.3)] and chocolate consumption [OR: 2.5 (95%
      CI 1.8-3.5)] were positively associated with developing ulcerative colitis. There
      was a negative association between the intake of citrus fruits [OR: 0.5 (95% CI
      0.4-0.8)] and 'having a stuffed pet' for a period longer than 5 years [OR: 0.6
      (95% CI 0.4-0.9)] and developing the disorder. No association with the frequency 
      of tooth brushing and developing IBD was found. CONCLUSION: All the nutritional
      items mentioned may be true risk factors or they just might be the expression of 
      a modern life-style also involving other risk factors for the development of IBD 
      which at the present are still unknown.

TI  - Nutritional factors in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 235-7
AB  - During the past 20 years there has been growing interest in the importance of
      nutritional factors in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. There are 
      so far no definite links between ulcerative colitis and diet, but links with
      Crohn's disease have been studied by both epidemiologists and clinicians.
      Epidemiological studies, although retrospective, have suggested that patients
      with Crohn's disease eat more sugar and sweets that control individuals; however,
      when dietary sugar is restricted, there is little clinical benefit. The clinical 
      approach to nutrition in Crohn's disease has been by the use of elemental diets, 
      which will produce symptomatic and objective remission in up to 90% of compliant 
      patients. Those who return to normal eating soon relapse but, in some studies,
      have enjoyed prolonged remission on exclusion diets. The foods excluded have been
      not sugar, but predominantly cereals, dairy products and yeast. Attention has now
      switched to the possible harmful role of fat in Crohn's disease. The efficacy of 
      elemental feeds appears to depend not on the presentation of nitrogen but on the 
      amount of long chain triglyceride present. Increases in recent years in the
      frequency of Crohn's disease in Japan have been correlated with increased dietary
      fat intake, and a recent study suggested that W-3 fatty acids, which are
      metabolized by immunomodulatory leukotrienes and prostaglandins, may have a
      beneficial role to play. The links between nutrition and Crohn's disease have now
      become strong and the role of fat may be the most exciting of all.

TI  - A prospective study of dietary fiber types and symptomatic diverticular disease
      in men.
PG  - 714-9
AB  - To examine prospectively dietary fiber calculated from food composition values
      based on analytic techniques and specific dietary fiber types in relation to risk
      of diverticular disease, we analyzed data from a prospective cohort of 43,881
      U.S. male health professionals 40-75 y of age at base line; subjects were free of
      diagnosed diverticular disease, colon or rectal polyps, ulcerative colitis and
      cancer. The insoluble component of fiber was inversely associated with risk of
      diverticular disease relative risk (RR) = 0. 63, 95% confidence interval (CI),
      0.44-0.91, P for trend = 0.02, and this association was particularly strong for
      cellulose (RR = 0.52, 95% CI, 0.36-0.75, P for trend = 0.002). The association
      between diverticular disease and total dietary fiber intake calculated from the
      AOACstandards method was not appreciably different from results using the
      Southgate or Englyst method [for AOAC method, RR = 0.60, 95% CI, 0.41-0.87; for
      Southgate method, RR = 0.61, 95% CI, 0.42-0. 88; for Englyst method, RR = 0.60,
      95% CI, 0.42-0.87, for the highest quintiles]. Our findings provide evidence for 
      the hypothesis that a diet high in dietary fiber decreases the risk of
      diverticular disease, and this result was not sensitive to the use of different
      analytic techniques to define dietary fiber. Our findings suggest that the
      insoluble component of fiber was significantly associated with a decreased risk
      of diverticular disease, and this inverse association was particularly strong for
      cellulose.

TI  - Nutritional issues and therapy in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 21-30
AB  - Nutritional issues in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) often receive inadequate
      attention both in regard to therapy and nutritionally related complications of
      IBD. This article reviews much of the research that has evaluated the role of
      diet in the causation, primary treatment, and adjunctive therapy of both
      ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Benefits have been demonstrated
      in the use of elemental diets or polymeric diets in CD in both acute flare up or 
      maintenance of IBD. A careful team approach can overcome problems in implementing
      nutritional therapy. Nutrition also has a critical benefit in postoperative CD
      and perioperative UC. Numerous easily corrected, nutritional abnormalities are
      often overlooked in patients with IBD, which may have significant consequences.
      Nutritional therapy may have a central place in the hierarchy of treatment in IBD
      and further research is critical in this area to better define the benefits of
      nutrition in IBD.

TI  - Preoperative perfusion of bypassed ileum does not improve postoperative function.
PG  - 429-35
AB  - This study evaluated whether twice daily isotonic perfusion of the bypassed ileum
      for six weeks would enhance its motor activity and its absorption of fluids,
      electrolytes, and vitamin B12. The study also determined if patients undergoing
      perfusion had improved bowel function and decreased hospital stay after ileostomy
      closure. Following proctocolectomy, ileal pouch-anal canal anastomosis, and
      diverting loop ileostomy, six patients self-infused an isotonic solution (sucrose
      and sodium chloride) into the bypassed ileum twice daily, while seven patients
      did not (controls). Two months following proctocolectomy, and just prior to
      ileostomy closure, a manometric catheter assembly was placed into the unused
      distal ileum via the stoma and the distal ileum perfused with an isotonic sodium 
      chloride solution for 3 hr during fasting and 3 hr after a meal. Absorption was
      measured, single and clustered pressure waves were identified, and a motility
      index was calculated. Water absorption, motility index, and cluster parameters
      did not improve in perfused patients compared to controls during fasting or after
      a meal, nor did perfused patients have improved vitamin B12 absorption. The
      perfused patients also did no better clinically following ileostomy takedown; the
      onset of bowel movements, their frequency, time to tolerate a diet, and hospital 
      stay were similar to controls. We conclude that six weeks of twice daily isotonic
      perfusion did not improve motor activity or water, electrolyte, and vitamin B12
      absorption in the bypassed distal ileum after proctocolectomy, ileal pouch-anal
      canal anastomosis, and loop ileostomy. The perfusion also did not improve bowel
      function after ileostomy takedown.

TI  - [Hemorrhagic colon ulcer as a side effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs in five aged patients].
PG  - 748-54
AB  - A report is presented of five aged patients with hemorrhagic colon ulcer, which
      was strongly suspected to be a side effect of non steroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs (NSAID). All patients were suffering from orthopedic diseases and NSAIDs
      were administered for pain: Zaltoprofen for one patient and slow-releasing
      diclofenac for the other four. Four patients had being treated underlying
      diabetes mellitus and three of them were being treated with sulfonylurea.
      Appetite loss was the earliest symptom, 1-2 weeks after administration of NSAID
      began. Diarrhea occurred 1-2 weeks after appetite loss, and finally hemorrhagic
      stool developed 1-2 weeks after that. Acute gastric mucosal lesion, hemorrhagic
      colon ulcer and colitis were diagnosed in all patients by emergency
      gastro-duodenocolonoscopy. NSAID and oral diet were ceased, and intravenous
      hyperalimentation was instituted when the patients revealed severe anemia due to 
      bleeding. All patients could take an oral diet after a few weeks. In conclusion
      hemorrhagic colon ulcer must be prevented in patients treated with NSAID
      especially those who are aged and have a history of diabetes mellitus.

TI  - Metabolic characteristics of healthy adult males as affected by ingestion of a
      liquid nutritional formula containing fish oil, oligosaccharides, gum arabic and 
      antioxidant vitamins.
PG  - 1165-76
AB  - n-3 Fatty acids from fish oil and short-chain fatty acids produced from
      fermentation of oligosaccharides may attenuate a portion of gut injury and
      inflammation associated with ulcerative colitis. The purpose of this study was to
      assess the effects of an enteral nutritional formula containing supplemental
      oligosaccharides, gum arabic and fish oil on serum metabolite profiles,
      haematology, plasma and red blood cell membrane phospholipid fatty acid profiles,
      urinary constituent, and safety in healthy human adult males. 30 subjects were
      randomly assigned to one of two treatments, a control formula (n = 10) and an
      ulcerative colitis nutritional formula (UCNF; n = 20). Formulas contained
      comparable levels of protein, fat and non-structural carbohydrates. Daily intake 
      of the formulas provided nutrients to meet or exceed the recommended daily
      allowance. Intake was recorded daily while blood and urine samples were collected
      weekly on days 0, 7 and 14. Certain subjects consuming large quantities of the
      UCNF experienced some abdominal distention, gas and loose stools. Sole source
      intake of the UCNF was safe over 14 days as assessed by routine measurements of
      serum metabolite profiles, haematology and urinalysis compared with subjects fed 
      the control formula. Substantial decreases in plasma and red blood cell
      phospholipid 18:2n-6 and increases in 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 within 1 wk of feeding 
      the UCNF were noted.

TI  - Dientamoeba fragilis masquerading as allergic colitis.
PG  - 16-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dientamoeba fragilis is a rare cause of chronic infectious diarrhea
      and colitis in children. METHODS: Review of the clinical manifestations,
      diagnostic methods, and clinical course of D. fragilis infection in our hospital.
      RESULTS: Eleven pediatric patients are discussed, seven of whom had a history of 
      recent travel. Clinical manifestations of infectious diarrhea included anorexia, 
      intermittent vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, ranging from 1 to 100 weeks 
      in duration. Peripheral eosinophilia was present in seven patients. One patient
      with well-documented bovine protein allergy had intermittent episodes of diarrhea
      and abdominal pain, despite an appropriate elimination diet. Eosinophilic colitis
      documented by colonoscopy, was due to D. fragilis. Metronidazole was effective in
      treating five patients, and iodoquinol was effective in treating four others.
      CONCLUSIONS: D. fragilis should be included in the differential diagnosis of
      chronic diarrhea and eosinophilic colitis. The identification of this pathogen
      requires clinical awareness of epidemiologic risk factors and presenting
      complaints, as well as the laboratory staining procedures essential to its proper
      identification.

TI  - Calcium and colorectal epithelial cell proliferation in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1021-7
AB  - In persons at higher risk for colon cancer (e.g., those with sporadic adenoma or 
      ulcerative colitis), compared to those at lower risk, colonic epithelial cell
      proliferation kinetics are altered. We have shown previously that calcium
      supplementation appears to normalize the distribution of proliferating cells
      without affecting the proliferation rate in the colorectal mucosa of sporadic
      adenoma patients. In a pilot randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      clinical trial conducted concurrently with our previously published sporadic
      adenoma trial, we tested whether calcium supplementation can also modulate cell
      proliferation kinetics in patients with ulcerative colitis. Ulcerative colitis
      patients (n = 31) were randomized to placebo or 2.0 g of supplemental calcium
      daily. Colorectal epithelial cell proliferation was determined by
      immunohistochemical detection of proliferating cell nuclear antigen labeling of
      cells in "nonprep" rectal biopsies taken at randomization and after 2 months
      treatment. All biopsies were scored by one reviewer. Differences in mean
      follow-up minus baseline labeling index (LI; the proportion of colon crypt
      epithelial cells that were labeled) and in the phi(h) (proportion of labeled
      cells that were in the upper 40% of the crypts) were compared with analysis of
      covariance. Pill-taking adherence was 97%. Biopsy-scoring reliability was high (r
      = 0.89). The pooled baseline LI and phi(h) were 6.3% and 5.6%, respectively. The 
      LI in the calcium group decreased by 0.5% (proportionately, 3%) more than in the 
      placebo group (P = 0.91). Similarly, the phi(h) in the calcium group decreased by
      0.3% (proportionately, 10%) more than in the placebo group (P = 0.85). This pilot
      study does not suggest that 2.0 g of calcium as calcium carbonate daily can
      substantially normalize either the rate or distribution of proliferating cells
      over a 2-month period in the colon crypts of patients with ulcerative colitis; a 
      more definitive answer to the question of whether calcium may be effective would 
      require a study with a larger sample size and/or other study design
      modifications.

TI  - A randomized, double-blind study of the effect of olestra on disease activity in 
      patients with quiescent inflammatory bowel disease. Olestra in IBD Study Group.
PG  - 389-99
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the effects of olestra, a zero-calorie fat substitute that 
      is neither digested nor absorbed, on the well-being and disease state of persons 
      with chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in remission. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
      Eighty-nine patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis (n = 43) or Crohn's
      disease (n = 46) in remission, with a history of disease of 2 years or longer,
      were enrolled in this prospective study from nine private practices, three
      university-based medical centers, and one Veterans Administration medical center 
      in the United States. Forty-four patients were randomly assigned to receive
      olestra and 45 to receive triglycerides in chips or cookies daily for 4 weeks. At
      Week 4, patients were classified as in remission, worsened, or relapsed according
      to an investigator's global assessment based on sigmoidoscopy (for ulcerative
      colitis) or the Crohn's disease activity index, laboratory findings, and clinical
      course. RESULTS: At Week 4, the olestra and triglyceride groups did not differ
      significantly with respect to the percentages of patients who relapsed (P =
      0.494; difference = 2.4%; upper 95% CL = 8.8%) or with respect to the percentages
      of patients who experienced any worsening of their symptoms (P = 0.630;
      difference = 0.2%; upper 95% CL = 13.3%). Of evaluable patients, 90% (37 of 41)
      given olestra remained in remission with no worsening, compared with 90% (38 of
      42) given triglycerides. Gastrointestinal symptoms were comparable between the
      treatment groups, and there were no treatment-related laboratory abnormalities.
      Six patients were excluded from analysis for reasons unrelated to treatment.
      CONCLUSION: Olestra did not affect the activity of quiescent mild to moderate
      IBD.

TI  - Gallbladder motility and cholecystokinin secretion during continuous enteral
      nutrition.
PG  - 2274-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: During total parenteral nutrition, gallbladder motility is impaired, 
      resulting in sludge and stone formation. Little is known about gallbladder
      motility during prolonged enteral nutrition. METHODS: We studied gallbladder
      motility during continuous enteral nutrition (CEN) in nine hospitalized patients 
      with active inflammatory bowel disease. The patients received a polymeric diet
      (2000 kcal/24 h) by CEN through a nasogastric tube for a prolonged period.
      Gallbladder volumes were obtained daily by ultrasonography, starting from day 0
      (before CEN) and on 7 consecutive days during CEN. At days 0, 1, 4, and 7, the
      gallbladder response to i.v. cholecystokinin (CCK-33; 0.5 Ivy Dog unit/kg/h) was 
      studied. Plasma CCK levels were determined at regular intervals by
      radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed on day 0
      between patients and a group of nine healthy control subjects in fasting
      gallbladder volumes (19.4 +/- 2.3 and 19.6 +/- 2.4 cm3, respectively) and
      gallbladder contraction during CCK infusion (56 +/- 14% and 69 +/- 7%,
      respectively). During CEN, from day 1 to day 7, mean gallbladder volume remained 
      significantly (p < 0.05) reduced compared with fasting gallbladder volume, and
      mean plasma CCK levels remained significantly (p < 0.05) increased compared with 
      fasting levels. Although gallbladder volume was significantly reduced during CEN,
      the gallbladder contractile response to CCK was not affected; at days 1, 4, and
      7, gallbladder contraction was 36-57%. CONCLUSIONS: During CEN, 1) gallbladder
      volume is significantly reduced and plasma CCK levels are significantly
      increased, 2) these effects are sustained over time (7 days), and 3) the
      gallbladder remains responsive to exogenous CCK. These results indicate that
      gallbladder contractility and gallbladder responsiveness to CCK are preserved
      during prolonged CEN in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Antiinflammatory effects of human milk on chemically induced colitis in rats.
PG  - 639-43
AB  - We examined the effects of a human milk diet on rats with chemical colitis
      induced with a 4% acetic acid enema. Colonic myeloperoxidase activity was used as
      a surrogate marker for neutrophil infiltration. Control rats fed rat chow had
      little colonic myeloperoxidase activity; geometric mean, 0.27 U/g of tissue. Rats
      with colitis fed rat chow had significantly increased colonic myeloperoxidase
      activity (geometric mean, 6.76 U/g, p < 0.01 versus no colitis), as did rats with
      colitis fed infant formula or Pedialyte (geometric mean, 6.92 and 8.13 U/g,
      respectively, both p < 0.01 versus no colitis). Animals with colitis fed human
      milk had significantly lower colonic myeloperoxidase activity (geometric mean,
      2.34 U/g) than did animals with colitis fed either chow or infant formula (p <
      0.001). Similar effects were seen in rats with colitis fed infant formula
      supplemented with recombinant human IL-1 receptor antagonist (geometric mean,
      1.95 U/g). These data show that orally administered human milk has an
      antiinflammatory effect on chemically induced colitis in rats, which may be
      mediated in part by IL-1 receptor antagonist contained in human milk.

TI  - The use of glutamine in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders in man.
PG  - 743-7
AB  - The human gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is a major site of glutamine utilisation
      accounting for more than half of the net splanchnic utilisation (approximately 15
      g/day) of glutamine obtained from the systemic circulation. Dietary glutamine
      (approximately 5 g/day) is less important than circulating glutamine, especially 
      in disease conditions associated with substantial reduction in food intake.
      Glutamine has multiple effects on the structure and function of the GIT, and
      effects in improving morbidity and mortality in animal models of GIT damage has
      led to a series of studies in man, which have produced variable results.
      Glutamine administration to treat mucositis of the upper GIT (mouth, oesophagus) 
      due to cytotoxic drug therapy, has produced no evidence of benefit. Early studies
      suggested improved healing, as do recent studies of small intestinal mucositis
      resulting from chemotherapy. Investigations in colitis are lacking although in
      experimental rat models of colitis no benefit has been reported. Multiple
      explanations can be put forward to explain the overall results, including the GIT
      distribution of enzymes involved in glutamine metabolism. Apart from the lower
      stomach in man (upper stomach in the rat) there is very little weak activity of
      glutamine synthetase, suggesting that the gut derives glutamine formed in other
      tissues and from the diet. The activity of glutaminase, which is key flux
      generating enzyme involved in glutaminolysis is very weak in mucosa with
      stratified squamous epithelium (oesophagus), where intermediate in the same
      intestine, and highest in the small intestinal mucosa which accounts for about
      80% of the total glutaminase in the entire human GIT mucosa.

TI  - An immunocompetent infant with cow's milk allergy and cytomegalovirus colitis.
PG  - 528-9
AB  - UNLABELLED: A 5-week-old, severely ill, infant is described with diarrhoea and
      rectal bleeding, followed by vomiting and dehydration after introduction of a
      cow's milk formula. A diagnosis of cow's milk allergy was made because of the
      clinical presentation of an allergic enterocolitis, the rapid improvement after
      introduction of a hypo-allergenic formula and development of colic directly after
      rechallenge with cow's milk. Furthermore a highly specific IgE for
      alpha-lactalbumin strongly supported the diagnosis. Because of recurrent rectal
      bleeding a limited colonoscopy was performed at the age of 10 weeks. Surprisingly
      a second diagnosis of histopathologically proven cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis
      was made. Extensive immunological screening revealed no signs of
      immunodeficiency. The child thrived without any treatment for CMV and developed
      normally. This is the first description of an immunocompetent infant with CMV
      colitis. CONCLUSION: It cannot be excluded that the allergic colitis facilitated 
      the CMV colitis, or vice versa CMV colitis triggered cow's milk protein induced
      entero-colitis. Further attention should be given to children with bloody
      diarrhoea to establish a possible relationship between CMV infection and cow's
      milk protein allergy.

OAB - A dysentery outbreak in the Central African Republic village of Zemio was
      diagnosed as "Shigella flexneri" by the Pasteur Institute in Bangui (IPB) in
      February 1996; 2 months later there was an outbreak of hemorrhagic colitis. 108
      patients presented with bloody diarrhea; cramping abdominal pain, fever, nausea, 
      and vomiting were uncommon. The illness lasted between 5 days and 3 weeks
      (average, 8 days). Antibiotics were ineffective. Four patients died and several
      developed hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Stool cultures done at IPB tested negative. 
      PCR was used to detect enterohemorrhagic Shiga-like toxin (SLT) 1 and 2, the
      invasivity gene ipaH, and the attaching and effacing gene eaeA. DNA fragments of 
      130 and 494 nucleotides corresponding to amplified SLT1 and eaeA were found in
      80% of the specimens tested. No amplification was obtained for SLT2 or for ipaH
      in specimens collected during the second epidemic. These results suggest the
      presence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and the absence of Shigella. The
      number of reported cases of acute bloody diarrhea in infants and adults in Bangui
      has increased since 1996. E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from two fatal adult
      cases. Smoked zebu meat was suspected in several hospital cases (bloody diarrhea,
      hemolytic anemia, and renal insufficiency) in which non-fermenting sorbitol E.
      coli O157:H7 was not isolated. In two cases of acute diarrhea, other serotypes of
      E. coli were indicated by retrospective PCR on stools which were positive for
      SLT1 and for eaeA and negative for invasivity. A study was conducted in Bangui on
      290 cases (33 with bloody diarrhea) and 140 controls. Patients were not paired
      because of civil unrest in the city. The questionnaire included demographic and
      socioeconomic characteristics, environmental factors, and habitual food
      consumption. The major contributing factor was consumption of locally made meat
      pies (kanda), which were made with smoked zebu meat. Kanda is stored at ambient
      temperature, often for days, before it is sold in markets or along roads. Before 
      1996, E. coli was not reported as a cause of bloody diarrhea in the Central
      African Republic.

TI  - Pre-illness dietary factors in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 754-60
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of environmental factors has been demonstrated in the
      pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Nutrition may be one of them.
      AIM: To investigate the pre-illness diet in patients with recent IBD in
      comparison with matched population and clinic controls. METHODS: Quantified
      dietary histories were obtained from 87 patients with recent IBD (54 ulcerative
      colitis (UC) and 33 Crohn's disease (CD)) and 144 controls. Odds ratios (OR) for 
      IBD were derived for intake levels of various foods. RESULTS: A high sucrose
      consumption was associated with an increased risk for IBD (OR 2.85 (p = 0.03)
      against population controls and 5.3 (p = 0.00) against clinic controls). Lactose 
      consumption showed no effect while fructose intake was negatively associated with
      risk for IBD (NS). Similar trends were noted in UC and CD. A high fat intake was 
      associated with an increased risk for UC; this was particularly marked for animal
      fat (OR 4.09, p = 0.02) and cholesterol (OR 4.57, p = 0.02). A high intake of
      fluids (p = 0.04), magnesium (p = 0.04), vitamin C, and fruits (NS) was
      negatively associated with the risk for IBD, while a positive association was
      found for retinol (p = 0.01). Most of the findings were similar in UC and CD
      except for potassium and vegetable consumption which showed a negative
      association only with risk for CD. CONCLUSIONS: An association was found between 
      pre-illness diet and subsequent development of UC and CD. The effect of dietary
      components may be primary or modulatory.

TI  - Self-reported food intolerance in chronic inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 569-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although suggested, it has never been convincingly documented that
      food sensitivity is of pathogenetic importance in chronic inflammatory bowel
      disease. However, many patients may relate their gastrointestinal symptoms to
      specific food items ingested and may restrict their diet accordingly. METHODS: A 
      questionnaire was sent to all patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease
      who attended the outpatient clinic, Medical Dept., Roskilde County Hospital in
      Koge, Denmark, in the year 1993. The patients were asked whether they had
      problems with any particular food item and, if so, to describe the symptoms
      experienced from it. A control group of 70 healthy persons were included.
      RESULTS: Among 189 patients, 132 (70%) responded. One hundred and thirty had
      completed the questionnaire, 52 males and 78 females aged 13-89 years (median, 43
      years). Fifty-three (41%) had Crohn's disease (CD), 69 (53%) ulcerative colitis
      (UC), and 8 (6%) unclassified colitis. Forty-one patients (31 CD, 10 UC)
      were-operated on; 51 (19 CD, 32 UC) had disease activity. Sixty-five per cent of 
      the patients and 14% of the controls reported being intolerant to one or more
      food items (P < 0.0001). The intolerance covered a wide range of food products.
      The commonest symptoms among patients were diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and
      meteorism and among controls, regurgitation. Food intolerance was equally common 
      in CD (66%) and UC (64%) and was not related to previous operation, disease
      activity or disease location. CONCLUSION: Most patients with chronic inflammatory
      bowel intolerance disease feel intolerant to different food items and may
      restrict their diet accordingly. The frequency and pattern of food intolerance
      did not differ between patients with CD and UC. The food intolerance was probably
      unspecific rather than of pathogenetic importance.

TI  - The prevalence and causes of chronic diarrhea in patients with celiac sprue
      treated with a gluten-free diet.
PG  - 1830-8
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The majority of patients with celiac sprue experience diarrhea
      before diagnosis. There have been no studies of the prevalence or causes of
      chronic diarrhea in these patients after treatment with a gluten-free diet.
      METHODS: Seventy-eight patients with celiac sprue (59 women and 19 men) treated
      with a gluten-free diet for at least 12 months were surveyed about their bowel
      habits. Those with chronic diarrhea, defined as passage of loose stools three or 
      more times per week for 6 months, underwent an extensive diagnostic evaluation to
      determine its cause. RESULTS: Sixty-two of the 78 patients (79%) experienced
      diarrhea before treatment, and 13 (17%) had chronic diarrhea (of lesser severity)
      after treatment. The causes of diarrhea in 11 patients consenting to this study
      were microscopic colitis, steatorrhea secondary to exocrine pancreatic
      insufficiency, dietary lactose or fructose malabsorption, anal sphincter
      dysfunction causing fecal incontinence, and the irritable bowel syndrome. Only 1 
      patient had antigliadin antibodies detected in serum or small intestinal villous 
      atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: After treatment of celiac sprue with a gluten-free diet,
      chronic diarrhea persists in a substantial percentage of patients. Although
      ongoing gluten ingestion is one possible cause, other causes may be more
      frequent. Therefore, diagnostic investigation of diarrhea in celiac sprue after
      treatment seems warranted.

TI  - Banana flakes control diarrhea in enterally fed patients.
PG  - 72-5
AB  - Diarrhea occurs frequently in the critically ill tube-fed population and may
      result from a multitude of causes. Despite the availability of antidiarrheal
      medications, diarrhea associated with enteral feedings remains a problem for
      clinicians and for the patients affected by it. We tested the hypothesis that
      administration of banana flakes would control diarrhea in critically ill patients
      receiving enteral feedings. Thirty-one patients with diarrhea and receiving
      enteral feedings were randomized to receive either banana flakes or medical
      treatment for diarrhea. Medical treatments included the use of pharmacological
      agents according to the discretion of the patient's physician or reducing feeding
      rates. Both banana flakes and medical treatments reduced the severity of diarrhea
      in critically ill tube-fed patients. Over the course of treatment, mean diarrhea 
      scores were 21.64 +/- 7.81 for the banana flake group and 25.41 +/- 9.76 for the 
      medical group. These differences were not statistically significant. Both groups 
      achieved similar levels of nutrition support. The banana flake group had less
      diarrhea clinically, with 57% of the subjects diarrhea free on their last study
      day as opposed to 24% of the medically treated subjects. This occurred despite a 
      threefold increase in the number of patients testing positive for Clostridium
      difficile toxin in the banana flake group. We conclude that banana flakes can be 
      used as a safe, cost-effective treatment for diarrhea in critically ill tube-fed 
      patients. Banana flakes can be given concurrently with a workup for C. difficile 
      colitis, thereby expediting treatment of diarrhea.

TI  - Geographic variations in eosinophil concentration in normal colonic mucosa.
PG  - 363-5
AB  - We reviewed 256 mucosal biopsy specimens from the descending and sigmoid colon
      obtained from surgical pathology departments in several areas of the United
      States. Only specimens of normal colonic mucosa were included, i.e., no specimens
      with acute or chronic colitis or adenomatous change, or in which eosinophils
      invaded the crypts or muscularis mucosae. The mean number of eosinophils per
      intercryptal space was highest in the southern United States, and there was a
      35-fold difference between the mean eosinophil concentrations of patients in New 
      Orleans and Boston. The reason for geographic variation is unknown, but it might 
      be related to allergens in the environment or diet. Normal variations in mucosal 
      eosinophil concentrations should be measured within a specific region before
      evaluating colonic biopsy specimens for eosinophilia.

AB  - We assessed consumption of fruit and vegetables amongst patients with ulcerative 
      colitis, colorectal polyps or previous carcinoma. The dietary intakes for 119
      patients attending a gastroenterology clinic for colonoscopy were assessed using 
      a questionnaire. A single age- and sex-matched control subject was recruited for 
      each patient. The patients consumed 12.8% less energy than the controls (P <
      0.02) and 28.9% less fruit and vegetables (P < 0.0001). Patients with neoplastic 
      disease consumed 21% less fruit and vegetables than the controls (n = 60; P <
      0.01). This group of patients at increased risk of colorectal cancer selected
      diets containing significantly less fruit and vegetables than symptomless
      controls.

AB  - The role of diet in the aetiology and pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC)
      remains uncertain. Impaired utilization by colonocytes of butyrate, a product of 
      bacterial fermentation of dietary carbohydrates escaping digestion, may be
      important. Sulphur-fermenting bacteria may be involved in this impaired
      utilization. Oxidative stress probably mediates tissue injury but is probably not
      of causative importance. Patients with UC are prone to malnutrition and its
      detrimental effects. However, there is no role for total parenteral nutrition and
      bowel rest as primary therapy for UC. The maintenance of adequate nutrition is
      very important, particularly in the peri-operative patient. In the absence of
      massive bleeding, perforation, toxic megacolon or obstruction, enteral rather
      than parenteral nutrition should be the mode of choice. Nutrients may be
      beneficial as adjuvant therapy. Butyrate enemas have improved patients with
      otherwise recalcitrant distal colitis in small studies. Non-cellulose fibre
      supplements are of benefit in rats with experimental colitis. Eicosapentaenoic
      acid in fish oil has a steroid-sparing effect which, although modest, is
      important, particularly in terms of reducing the risk of osteoporosis, but it
      seems to have no role in the patient with inactive disease. gamma-Linolenic acid 
      and anti-oxidants also are showing promise. Nutrients may also modify the
      increased risk of colorectal carcinoma. Oxidative stress can damage tissue DNA
      but there are no data published at present on possible protection from oral
      anti-oxidants. Butyrate protects against experimental carcinogenesis in rats with
      experimental colitis. Folate supplementation is weakly associated with decreased 
      incidence of cancer in UC patients when assessed retrospectively. Vigilance
      should be maintained for increased micronutrient requirements and supplements
      given as appropriate. Calcium and low-dose vitamin D should be given to patients 
      on long-term steroids and folate to those on sulphasalazine.

TI  - Management of the first presentation of severe acute colitis.
PG  - 129-51
AB  - Prompt diagnosis and exclusion of infection requires a minimum of rigid
      sigmoidoscopy, rectal mucosal biopsy and stool culture. Admission to hospital is 
      mandatory for patients with features of severe disease, or who are in their first
      attack of ulcerative colitis and have bloody diarrhoea, even if the criteria for 
      severe disease are not met. Once admitted, the patient should be monitored by
      plain abdominal X-ray, full blood count, serum albumin and C reactive protein on 
      alternate days; temperature and pulse rate should be recorded four times per day.
      Treatment should be instituted as soon as the diagnosis is made with an
      intravenous corticosteroid (hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenously, four times
      daily, or equivalent). Antibiotics may be included if infection cannot be
      confidently excluded. Free diet can be allowed but attention should be given to
      nutritional, fluid and electrolyte status with intravenous replacement if
      necessary. Any evidence of colonic dilatation occurring despite maximal therapy
      should be regarded as an absolute indication for colectomy. The patient should be
      kept fully informed from an early stage about the likely natural history of the
      condition and about the possible therapeutic options including surgery.
      Cyclosporin therapy should be reserved for patients who have a poor response to
      the first 3-4 days of corticosteroid therapy, particularly those with serum C
      reactive protein > 45 mg/l and who do not yet have absolute indications for
      colectomy. Most patients who have not convincingly responded within 10 days of
      starting full medical therapy should undergo colectomy, although partial
      responders who are afebrile may reasonably continue for up to 14 days before a
      final decision. Approximately 30-40% of patients with severe colitis will need
      colectomy within the first 6 months. With optimal management, mortality should be
      zero, but better medical therapies are urgently needed to reduce the colectomy
      rate.

AB  - The relationships between non-specific inflammatory bowel disease and nutrition
      is considered. One of the hypotheses holds that environmental factors, especially
      those in dietary intake, can be the initiators of intestinal inflammation. In
      this connection authors examined a group of patients suffering from Crohns
      disease and ulcerative colitis. Results observed in patients with Crohns disease 
      indicate: preferred consumption of flour products, decreased intake of vegetables
      and fruit, lowered tolerance to milk and milk products, increased sugar
      consumption, increased proportion of smokers, no differences in diet regimen
      between nick and healthy subjects. (Tab. 3, Ref. 16.)

TI  - Dairy sensitivity, lactose malabsorption, and elimination diets in inflammatory
      bowel disease.
PG  - 564-7
AB  - The ability of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients to tolerate dairy
      products and the guidance they receive from physicians and nutritionists on this 
      subject are important considerations in the management of their IBD. Although
      most affected persons are able to consume a glass of milk daily without
      discomfort, additional consideration must be given to specific factors that can
      be relevant to certain individuals. The declaration by patients that they are
      "dairy sensitive" may be related to lactose intolerance or malabsorption, the
      long-chain triacylglycerol content of milk, allergy to milk proteins, as well as 
      psychologic factors and the misconception that dairy products can be detrimental 
      to their health. The prevalence of lactose malabsorption is significantly greater
      in patients with Crohn disease involving the small bowel than it is in patients
      with Crohn disease involving the colon or ulcerative colitis. In the latter
      colonic conditions the prevalence of lactose malabsorption is mainly determined
      by ethnic risk, which is based on genetic factors. In addition, lactose
      malabsorption in Crohn disease of the small bowel may be determined by factors
      other than lactase enzyme activity, such as bacterial overgrowth and/or small
      bowel transit time. Physicians differ widely in the advice they give their
      patients: some dogmatically advise avoidance of dairy products when the diagnosis
      is made whereas others discount the possible role of dairy in the management of
      IBD. IBD patients avoid dairy products more than they would need to based on the 
      prevalence of lactose malabsorption and/or milk intolerance, probably partly
      because of incorrect patient perceptions and arbitrary advice from physicians and
      authors of popular diet books. Adequate scientific and clinical information is
      now available to permit recommendations about the intake of dairy products for
      each IBD patient.

TI  - Butyrate and the colonocyte. Production, absorption, metabolism, and therapeutic 
      implications.
PG  - 123-34
AB  - Butyrate, a SCFA generated by microbial fermentation of dietary substrates, is
      produced in the colon of humans and may influence colonic disease. It is possible
      to manipulate the diet in order to enhance levels of butyrate in various regions 
      of the large intestine. Butyrate is absorbed by colonocytes in the proximal colon
      via passive diffusion and by active transport mechanisms which are linked to
      various ion exchange transporters. In the distal colon, the main mechanism of
      absorption is passive diffusion of the lipid-soluble form. Butyrate and other
      SCFA are important for the absorption of electrolytes by the large intestine and 
      may play a role in preventing certain types of diarrhea. The mechanism by which
      butyrate and other SCFA exerts control over fluid and electrolyte fluxes in the
      colon is not well delineated though it may occur through an energy generated fuel
      effect, the up-regulation of various electrolyte transport systems, as well as
      possible effects on neuroendocrine factors. Butyrate has been shown to have
      beneficial effects on some colonic pathologies. This SCFA may be protective
      against colorectal neoplasia. Butyrate regulates colonic motility, increases
      colonic blood flow and may enhance colonic anastomosis healing. Butyrate may
      reduce the symptoms from ulcerative colitis and diversion colitis and it may
      prevent the progression of colitis in general. Further investigations are needed 
      to confirm these findings in controlled, randomized, double blinded clinical
      studies.

AB  - Rheumatic manifestations of diseases primarily of the gastrointestinal tract,
      liver, or pancreas are frequent and vary from soft tissue rheumatism and carpal
      tunnel syndrome to Raynaud's phenomenon, osteoporosis, arthritis, and vasculitis.
      Some patients with celiac disease develop osteoporosis and arthritis responsive
      to a gluten-free diet. It seems that osteoporosis is a frequent feature in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and steroid use is an important risk
      factor. The use of steroids in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis has generated medicolegal questions. This year a wealth of information
      has been published regarding hepatitis C virus infection. Arthritis, myopathy,
      and antibody production are some of the reported manifestations of chronic
      hepatitis C virus infection. There is evidence that may link chronic hepatitis C 
      virus infection with the antiphospholipid syndrome.

      excretion of cholesterol, Ca, Mg, Zn, Fe, or bile acids but increases energy
      excretion in ileostomy subjects.
PG  - 1-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of inulin and oligofructose on cholesterol 
      absorption and excretion of cholesterol, bile acids, energy, nitrogen and
      minerals in man. DESIGN: Double-blind cross-over study. SETTING: Metabolic
      kitchen with policlinic visits, Sahlgrenska Hospital, Goteborg, Sweden. SUBJECTS:
      Patients with conventional ileostomy because of ulcerative colitis.
      INTERVENTIONS: 7 g of inulin, 17 g of oligofructose and 7 g of sucrose were added
      to a controlled diet during three experimental periods of three days each.
      Ileostomy effluents were collected and analysed. Differences between experimental
      and control diet were investigated with the Wilcoxon's sign and values test.
      RESULTS: Inulin and oligofructose were recovered in the ileostomy effluent to 88%
      (95% CI, 76-100%) and 89% (64-114%) respectively. Dry solid excretion increased
      by 14.4 g (11.3-17.5) on inulin, and by 14.7 g (13.0-16.4 g) on oligofructose and
      energy excretion increased 245 kJ (190-307 kJ) on inulin and 230 kJ (214-315 kJ) 
      on oligofructose compared to control diet (P < 0.05). Cholesterol absorption,
      excretion of cholesterol, bile acids, nitrogen, fat, calcium, magnesium, zinc and
      iron were not affected by inulin and oligofructose. CONCLUSIONS: Inulin and
      oligofructose are not digested in the small intestine. They do not affect mineral
      excretion and hence hardly mineral absorption. They do not increase fat or
      nitrogen excretion from the small intestine. Any physiological effect of inulin
      and oligofructose is probably mediated through other mechanisms than altered
      excretion from the small intestine.

TI  - Pectin and methyl cellulose do not affect intestinal function in patients after
      ileal pouch-anal anastomosis.
PG  - 99-102
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is the procedure of choice for 
      most patients with ulcerative colitis or familial adenomatous polyposis, most
      patients have problems with stool frequency and/or consistency. Although most
      clinicians recommend fiber supplementation for these patients, we could find no
      studies that prove the efficacy of this practice. The first purpose of this study
      was to document the effect of fiber supplementation on intestinal function in
      patients after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. Because pectin, a soluble fiber
      supplement, has been reported to slow gastric and intestinal transit, we also
      hypothesized that pectin would be a superior fiber supplement in these patients. 
      The second purpose, therefore, was to determine whether the effects of pectin on 
      intestinal transit would result in decreased stool frequency in patients with an 
      ileal pouch. METHODS: Thirteen patients who had undergone ileal pouch-anal
      anastomosis for ulcerative colitis were entered into a 9-wk crossover study. The 
      protocol consisted of three 2-wk study periods, each of which was preceded by a
      1-wk washout period. During the three study periods patients supplemented their
      diets, in random order, with Citrucel, 1 tablespoon twice daily; pectin, 1
      tablespoon twice daily; or no supplement. Patients maintained detailed dietary
      and bowel function diaries. RESULTS: The effects (mean +/- SE) of Citrucel and
      pectin supplementation are summarized in Table 1. There was no significant effect
      of either supplement on stool frequency, pouch function, bloating, or stool
      consistency. In addition, there were no differences in continence. CONCLUSIONS:
      We found no evidence to support the common practice of fiber supplementation in
      patients with an ileal pouch. Furthermore, this study did not find that stool
      frequency decreased during supplementation with pectin. We conclude that there is
      little role for fiber supplementation in patients with an ileal pouch.
