AB  - Diffuse gastroduodenitis resembling ulcerative colitis in respect to macro- and
      microscopic findings occurs in ulcerative colitis, although it is rare. Reports
      of gastroduodenitis associated with ulcerative colitis treated with infliximab
      are rare. A 58-year-old man had tarry stool in March 2011. He had a history of
      ulcerative colitis that was diagnosed in 1984. He underwent subtotal colectomy in
      1991. Endoscopy and radiography revealed diffuse friable mucosa throughout the
      duodenum and an ulcer in the middle of the descending portion, resulting in a
      narrow portion.In the stomach, numerous small aphthae were observed in the
      antrum. Biopsy specimens of the duodenum and antrum showed marked inflammatory
      cell infiltration in both areas and cryptitis in the duodenum. Standard induction
      therapy of infliximab was started in April. The ulcer in the descending portion
      became a scar without diffuse mucosal friability in September 2011.

TI  - Nutrition in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease: is it useful for prevention
      and therapy?
PG  - 983-90
AB  - Countless studies aiming to discover the cause and cure of inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) have been conducted over the years world-wide. Food nutrients were 
      believed to play a certain role in the causation of the disease, in conjunction
      with genetic, immunologic, environmental and other factors (especially intestinal
      microbiota). Various nutrients were found to be involved, sometimes with
      controversial results, possibly pertaining to geographic regions. Nutrition has
      to be especially considered in children as disease itself and/or the medication
      can severely impair normal growth and development, sometimes with permanent
      long-term sequels. We reviewed the data on the possible roles of diet in
      preventing the disease and relapses. We emphasize the crucial importance of
      enteral nutrition in inducing and maintaining the remission of Crohn's disease,
      according to the existing consensuses (benefits, indications, routes of
      administration, types of formula, duration, results). We also present data on
      parenteral nutrition in pediatric IBD, with current updates from literature.

AB  - Acute diarrhea is defined as an abnormally frequent discharge of semisolid or
      fluid fecal matter from the bowel, lasting less than 14 days. More than three
      millions cases of acute diarrhea, presumably due to intestinal infections, are
      seen in general practice every year in France. Most of the cases are benign and
      resolve under symptomatic treatment within 3 days, without need for biological
      tests or antibiotics. In special contexts (septicemic syndrome, visible blood in 
      stools, severe dehydration, patients at risk of severe sepsis [valvulopathy]),
      biologic tests and probabilist antibiotic treatment are required. Hygiene,
      rehydration and diet recommendations are always part of the treatment of acute
      diarrhea, in addition to the symptomatic treatment of diarrhea and other
      digestive symptoms. Antibiotic-associated diarrhea is clinically benign in most
      cases, and attributed to transient dysbiosis of gut microbiota. In the remaining 
      cases, diarrhea is the clinical expression of intestinal infection by Clostridium
      difficile, that should be treated with metronidazole, or the clinical expression 
      of a Klebsiella oxytoca-associated colitis that usually spontaneously resolves
      after stopping antibiotics.

TI  - DHA-enriched fish oil targets B cell lipid microdomains and enhances ex vivo and 
      in vivo B cell function.
PG  - 463-70
LID - 10.1189/jlb.0812394 [doi]
AB  - DHA is a n-3 LCPUFA in fish oil that generally suppresses T lymphocyte function. 
      However, the effect of fish oil on B cell function remains relatively
      understudied. Given the important role of B cells in gut immunity and increasing 
      human fish oil supplementation, we sought to determine whether DFO leads to
      enhanced B cell activation in the SMAD-/- colitis-prone mouse model, similar to
      that observed with C57BL/6 mice. This study tested the hypothesis that DHA from
      fish oil is incorporated into the B cell membrane to alter lipid microdomain
      clustering and enhance B cell function. Purified, splenic B cells from DFO-fed
      mice displayed increased DHA levels and diminished GM1 microdomain clustering.
      DFO enhanced LPS-induced B cell secretion of IL-6 and TNF-alpha and increased
      CD40 expression ex vivo compared with CON. Despite increased MHCII expression in 
      the unstimulated ex vivo B cells from DFO-fed mice, we observed no difference in 
      ex vivo OVA-FITC uptake in B cells from DFO or CON mice. In vivo, DFO increased
      lymphoid tissue B cell populations and surface markers of activation compared
      with CON. Finally, we investigated whether these ex vivo and in vivo observations
      were consistent with systemic changes. Indeed, DFO-fed mice had significantly
      higher plasma IL-5, IL-13, and IL-9 (Th2-biasing cytokines) and cecal IgA
      compared with CON. These results support the hypothesis and an emerging concept
      that fish oil enhances B cell function in vivo.

TI  - [Frequency of anemia in ulcerative colitis in children].
PG  - 138-42
AB  - UNLABELLED: Anemia is one of most frequent complication of ulcerative colitis. It
      affects patients in the exacerbation of the disease as well as in the remission. 
      It may be caused by the loss of the blood, the disturbances of intestinal
      absorption or deficient diet. The aim of the study was to estimate the rate of
      anemia in children with ulcerative colitis during first hospitalization. MATERIAL
      AND METHODS: The study comprised 36 children aged 2.5 to 18 years, 23 girls and
      13 boys in whom ulcerative colitis was diagnosed based on the Porto criteria.
      Anemia in children was assessed depending on the age, period between first
      symptoms and diagnosis of the disease and on the activity of the disease
      according to PUCAI scale. RESULTS: Anemia was diagnosed in 72.2% of the children.
      Hemoglobin concentration ranged from 6.3 to 12.4 g/dl, average 10.05 g/dl
      depending on age. Activity of the disease according to PUCAI scale amounted to 5 
      to 80 points, average 51.9 points. Time from first symptoms to the diagnosis of
      the disease extended from one week to 12 months, average 3.6 months. In children 
      without anemia the average concentration of hemoglobin was 13.2 g/dl, the
      activity of the disease 33.5 points and average time before diagnosis - 1.7
      months. CONCLUSIONS: Anemia is a frequent symptom of ulcerative colitis in
      children. The presence of anemia depends on the disease activity and on the time 
      between first symptoms and diagnosis of the disease. There is a necessity of iron
      supplementation in children with anemia despite effective anti-inflammatory
      treatment.

TI  - Reduced bone breakage and increased bone strength in free range laying hens fed
      omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplemented diets.
PG  - 578-86
LID - 10.1016/j.bone.2012.11.003 [doi]
LID - S8756-3282(12)01345-2 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are the
      immediate precursors to a number of important mediators of immunity, inflammation
      and bone function, with products of omega-6 generally thought to promote
      inflammation and favour bone resorption. Western diets generally provide a 10 to 
      20-fold deficit in omega-3 PUFAs compared with omega-6, and this is thought to
      have contributed to the marked rise in incidence of disorders of modern human
      societies, such as heart disease, colitis and perhaps osteoporosis. Many of our
      food production animals, fed on grains rich in omega-6, are also exposed to a
      dietary deficit in omega-3, with perhaps similar health consequences. Bone
      fragility due to osteoporotic changes in laying hens is a major economic and
      welfare problem, with our recent estimates of breakage rates indicating up to 95%
      of free range hens suffer breaks during lay. METHODS: Free range hens housed in
      full scale commercial systems were provided diets supplemented with omega-3 alpha
      linolenic acid, and the skeletal benefits were investigated by comparison to
      standard diets rich in omega-6. RESULTS: There was a significant 40-60% reduction
      in keel bone breakage rate, and a corresponding reduction in breakage severity in
      the omega-3 supplemented hens. There was significantly greater bone density and
      bone mineral content, alongside increases in total bone and trabecular volumes.
      The mechanical properties of the omega-3 supplemented hens were improved, with
      strength, energy to break and stiffness demonstrating significant increases.
      Alkaline phosphatase (an osteoblast marker) and tartrate-resistant acid
      phosphatase (an osteoclast marker) both showed significant increases with the
      omega-3 diets, indicating enhanced bone turnover. This was corroborated by the
      significantly lower levels of the mature collagen crosslinks, hydroxylysyl
      pyridinoline, lysyl pyridinoline and histidinohydroxy-lysinonorleucine, with a
      corresponding significant shift in the mature:immature crosslink ratio.
      CONCLUSIONS: The improved skeletal health in laying hens corresponds to as many
      as 68million fewer hens suffering keel fractures in the EU each year. The
      biomechanical and biochemical evidence suggests that increased bone turnover has 
      enhanced the bone mechanical properties, and that this may suggest potential
      benefits for human osteoporosis.

TI  - Providing holistic support for patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 466, 468-72
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are
      life-long, complex conditions. They are characterised by periods of exacerbation 
      and remission and surgical intervention may be required in severe cases. Drugs
      employed in the management of IBD are used to induce remission and maintain
      remission. IBD has a physical, psychological and sociological impact on
      individuals and IBD quality standards have been developed to provide a framework 
      for addressing the services and care that should be available for them.
      Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies play an important role in 
      the holistic approach to management of IBD as they are being increasingly used
      alongside conventional medical treatments. Community nurses have an important
      role to play in the management and care of individuals with IBD and in supporting
      them in making informed and appropriate choices that support their wellbeing and 
      quality of life.

TI  - Quality of life after ileo-anal pouch formation: patient perceptions.
PG  - S11-4, S16-9
AB  - This article describes a qualitative study, exploring the experiences of six
      individuals who have undergone an ileo-anal pouch formation and their subsequent 
      lifestyle after this reconstructive surgical procedure. The aim of this study was
      to ascertain whether individuals who had an ileo-anal pouch believed themselves
      to have a good quality of life and a lifestyle that was not compromised as a
      result of surgery. The themes that emerged through the interviews were common to 
      several participants and reflected their life, the decisions they were required
      to make and the resources available in order for them to do so. The outcome of
      this study, using a phenomenological approach, highlights that some individuals
      restrict their lifestyle, while others do not and are prepared to live with the
      consequences. The literature overwhelmingly concludes that the ileo-anal pouch
      procedure is a safe and efficient procedure with high patient satisfaction and
      good functional outcome, which should be recommended as a long-term option for
      ulcerative colitis and familial adenomatous polyposis sufferers. However, some
      patients curtail their lifestyle by restricting diet, altering meal patterns and 
      minimising social activities to maintain day-to-day living with an ileo-anal
      pouch.

TI  - Mushroom Ganoderma lucidum prevents colitis-associated carcinogenesis in mice.
PG  - e47873
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0047873 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies suggest that mushroom intake is inversely
      correlated with gastric, gastrointestinal and breast cancers. We have recently
      demonstrated anticancer and anti-inflammatory activity of triterpene extract
      isolated from mushroom Ganoderma lucidum (GLT). The aim of the present study was 
      to evaluate whether GLT prevents colitis-associated carcinogenesis in mice.
      METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Colon carcinogenesis was induced by the food-borne
      carcinogen (2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazol[4,5-b]pyridine [PhIP]) and
      inflammation (dextran sodium sulfate [DSS]) in mice. Mice were treated with 0,
      100, 300 and 500 mg GLT/kg of body weight 3 times per week for 4 months. Cell
      proliferation, expression of cyclin D1 and COX-2 and macrophage infiltration was 
      assessed by immunohistochemistry. The effect of GLT on XRE/AhR, PXR and rPXR was 
      evaluated by the reporter gene assays. Expression of metabolizing enzymes CYP1A2,
      CYP3A1 and CYP3A4 in colon tissue was determined by immunohistochemistry. GLT
      treatment significantly suppressed focal hyperplasia, aberrant crypt foci (ACF)
      formation and tumor formation in mice exposed to PhIP/DSS. The anti-proliferative
      effects of GLT were further confirmed by the decreased staining with Ki-67 in
      colon tissues. PhIP/DSS-induced colon inflammation was demonstrated by the
      significant shortening of the large intestine and macrophage infiltrations,
      whereas GLT treatment prevented the shortening of colon lengths, and reduced
      infiltration of macrophages in colon tissue. GLT treatment also significantly
      down-regulated PhIP/DSS-dependent expression of cyclin D1, COX-2, CYP1A2 and
      CYP3A4 in colon tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that GLT could be
      considered as an alternative dietary approach for the prevention of
      colitis-associated cancer.

      of metabolite analysis.
PG  - 5573-85
LID - 10.1021/pr300637d [doi]
AB  - Microbial metabolism of proteins and amino acids by human gut bacteria generates 
      a variety of compounds including phenol, indole, and sulfur compounds and
      branched chain fatty acids, many of which have been shown to elicit a toxic
      effect on the lumen. Bacterial fermentation of amino acids and proteins occurs
      mainly in the distal colon, a site that is often fraught with symptoms from
      disorders including ulcerative colitis (UC) and colorectal cancer (CRC). In
      contrast to carbohydrate metabolism by the gut microbiota, proteolysis is less
      extensively researched. Many metabolites are low molecular weight, volatile
      compounds. This review will summarize the use of analytical methods to detect and
      identify compounds in order to elucidate the relationship between specific
      dietary proteinaceous substrates, their corresponding metabolites, and
      implications for gastrointestinal health.

TI  - Allergic colitis in monozygotic preterm twins.
PG  - 198-201
LID - 10.3109/08923973.2012.734511 [doi]
AB  - Allergic colitis (AC) typically develops in the first weeks or months of life and
      is characterized by the presence of red blood in the stools of healthy breastfed 
      or formula fed infants. In this paper, we describe a case of rectal bleeding in
      monozygotic preterm twins that was resolved with the introduction of a cow's milk
      protein-free diet (CMPFD). The occurrence of this disorder in monozygotic twins
      raises the question as to whether the underlying abnormality in the immune
      regulation, which leads to poor acquisition of tolerance to cow's milk proteins, 
      might be inherited or environmentally acquired. The case also highlights the use 
      of the probiotic Lactobacillus GG (LGG) in the treatment of allergic colitis.

AB  - The new information presented in Digestive Disease Week has allowed us to
      speculate on the future of inflammatory bowel disease. Manipulation of diet and
      the microbioma will probably play an increasingly important role in the treatment
      of this disease and, in the long term, in its prevention. Biological agents will 
      probably be used earlier and more widely; new information on levels of biological
      agents, mucosal healing and new comparative studies will also allow these agents 
      to be used in a more precise and personalized way. In addition to infliximab,
      adalimumab, natalizumab and certolizumab, other biological agents will be
      employed; among the first of these to be used will be ustekinumab, golimumab and 
      vedolizumab. In the near future, biological agents will be used as frequently in 
      ulcerative colitis as in Crohn's disease. New healthcare models will be developed
      that will progressively include greater participation among patients and nurses. 
      The ability to predict new diagnostic and prognostic models will allow decisions 
      to be more individualized.

TI  - Diet-induced dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota and the effects on immunity
      and disease.
PG  - 1095-119
AB  - The gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota is the collection of microbes which reside
      in the GI tract and represents the largest source of non-self antigens in the
      human body. The GI tract functions as a major immunological organ as it must
      maintain tolerance to commensal and dietary antigens while remaining responsive
      to pathogenic stimuli. If this balance is disrupted, inappropriate inflammatory
      processes can result, leading to host cell damage and/or autoimmunity. Evidence
      suggests that the composition of the intestinal microbiota can influence
      susceptibility to chronic disease of the intestinal tract including ulcerative
      colitis, Crohn's disease, celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome, as well as
      more systemic diseases such as obesity, type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes.
      Interestingly, a considerable shift in diet has coincided with increased
      incidence of many of these inflammatory diseases. It was originally believed that
      the composition of the intestinal microbiota was relatively stable from early
      childhood; however, recent evidence suggests that diet can cause dysbiosis, an
      alteration in the composition of the microbiota, which could lead to aberrant
      immune responses. The role of the microbiota and the potential for diet-induced
      dysbiosis in inflammatory conditions of the GI tract and systemic diseases will
      be discussed.

TI  - 5-Aminosalicylates and renal function monitoring in inflammatory bowel disease: a
      nationwide survey.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: 5-Aminosalicylates (ASA) are widely used in inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD). Nephrotoxicity has been described in some IBD patients
      treated with 5-ASA. Whether physicians managing these patients are monitoring
      renal function in daily practice is unknown. The aims of this paper were to
      investigate how private gastroenterologists monitor renal function and manage
      renal failure in IBD patients treated with oral 5-ASA therapy. METHODS: This was 
      a web-based cross sectional national survey which was conducted among private
      gastroenterologists. RESULTS: A total of 249 practitioners completed the survey. 
      Eighty two percent (n=205) of responders declared that they always monitor renal 
      function. The respondents monitored twice a year Glomerular Filtration Rate
      (eGFR) using Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) [90% (n=225)] and
      Creatinine Clearance (CCr) using a 24-hour urine collection [51% (n=126)]. Blood 
      electrolytes, 24-hour urinary protein rate and dipsticks are performed by 41%,
      39% and 22% of practitioners, respectively. Before oral 5-ASA initiation, 59%
      (n=148) of respondents screen for renal failure. In case of elevated serum
      creatinine, a nephrologist's opinion is asked by 80% (n=200) of responders and by
      76% (n=189) of respondents before treatment initiation. CONCLUSIONS: Most
      gastroenterologists are monitoring renal function once or twice a year in IBD
      patients on 5-ASA. Less than two thirds of them screen for renal failure before
      treatment initiation. MDRD is mainly used, but a wide range of parameters is
      evaluated.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
      disease are chronically relapsing, immune-mediated disorders of the
      gastrointestinal tract. A major challenge in the treatment of IBD is the
      heterogenous nature of these pathologies. Both, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
      disease are of multifactorial etiology and feature a complex interaction of host 
      genetic susceptibility and environmental factors such as diet and gut microbiota.
      Genome-wide association studies identified disease-relevant single-nucleotide
      polymorphisms in approximately 100 genes, but at the same time twin studies also 
      clearly indicated a strong environmental impact in disease development. However, 
      attempts to link dietary factors to the risk of developing IBD, based on
      epidemiological observations showed controversial outcomes. Yet, emerging
      high-throughput technologies implying complete biological systems might allow
      taking nutrient-gene interactions into account for a better classification of
      patient subsets in the future. In this context, 2 new scientific fields,
      "nutrigenetics" and "nutrigenomics" have been established. "Nutrigenetics,"
      studying the effect of genetic variations on nutrient-gene interactions and
      "Nutrigenomics," describing the impact of nutrition on physiology and health
      status on the level of gene transcription, protein expression, and metabolism. It
      is hoped that the integration of both research areas will promote the
      understanding of the complex gene-environment interaction in IBD etiology and in 
      the long-term will lead to personalized nutrition for disease prevention and
      treatment. This review briefly summarizes data on the impact of nutrients on
      intestinal inflammation, highlights nutrient-gene interactions, and addresses the
      potential of applying "omic" technologies in the context of IBD.

AB  - Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, collectively known as inflammatory bowel 
      disease, represent the heterogeneous outcome of three colliding influences:
      genetic risk factors, environmental modifiers, and immune effector mechanisms of 
      tissue injury. The nature of these inputs is complex, with each having distinct
      and overlapping contributions to ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.
      Identification of specific genetic risk factors has improved the understanding of
      specific pathways to disease, but the primacy of environmental or lifestyle
      factors linked to changes in the gut microbiota, particularly in early life, is
      increasingly evident. Clarification of the molecular basis of host-microbe
      interactions in health and in susceptible individuals promises novel therapeutic 
      strategies.

      disease.
PG  - 3814-22
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v18.i29.3814 [doi]
AB  - Besides their possible effects on the development of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD), some environmental factors can modulate the clinical course of both
      ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). This review is mainly devoted
      to describing the current knowledge of the impact of some of these factors on the
      outcome of IBD, with special emphasis on smoking and diet. Although the impact of
      smoking on the susceptibility to develop CD and UC is firmly established, its
      influence on the clinical course of both diseases is still debatable. In CD,
      active smoking is a risk factor for postoperative recurrence. Beyond this
      clinical setting, smoking cessation seems to be advantageous in those CD patients
      who were smokers at disease diagnosis, while smoking resumption may be of benefit
      in ex-smokers with resistant UC. The role of dietary habits on the development of
      IBD is far from being well established. Also, food intolerances are very
      frequent, but usually inconsistent among IBD patients, and therefore no general
      dietary recommendations can be made in these patients. In general, IBD patients
      should eat a diet as varied as possible. Regarding the possible therapeutic role 
      of some dietary components in IBD, lessons should be drawn from the investigation
      of the primary therapeutic effect of enteral nutrition in CD. Low-fat diets seem 
      to be particularly useful. Also, some lipid sources, such as olive oil,
      medium-chain triglycerides, and perhaps omega-3 fatty acids, might have a
      therapeutic effect. Fermentable fiber may have a role in preventing relapses in
      inactive UC.

TI  - [Non-responsive coeliac disease: what to do?].
PG  - A4843
AB  - Coeliac disease (CD) is the most common cause of villous atrophy and is
      increasingly recognized. The majority of CD patients responds to a gluten-free
      diet (GFD). However, some patients experience persistence or recurrence of
      symptoms despite a GFD. These patients require further diagnostic workup. We
      describe a 62-year-old female with recurring symptoms attributed to refractory
      coeliac disease (RCD) type I. A 66-year-old patient with a similar history had
      aberrant intraepithelial lymphocytes characteristic for RCD type II in her
      duodenum. Furthermore, in a third CD patient described here, microscopic colitis 
      was responsible for diarrhoea that persisted despite strict dietary adherence.
      Microscopic colitis is strongly associated with CD and should be considered in
      patients with this disease. On the basis of these three illustrative case
      studies, we discuss the causes of non-responsive CD and their respective
      diagnostic workup.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment resistant chronic pouchitis causes significant morbidity.
      Elemental diet is effective treatment for Crohn's disease. Since pouchitis shares
      some similarities to Crohn's disease we hypothesised that elemental diet may be
      an effective treatment. METHOD: Seven pouchitis patients (with ulcerative
      colitis) were studied. All had active pouchitis with a pouch disease activity
      index (PDAI) >/=7. Exclusion criteria were recent NSAIDs, antibiotics or
      probiotics. Sufficient elemental diet to achieve energy requirements was
      provided. Flexible-pouchoscopy was performed, and the Cleveland Global Quality of
      Life score (CGQoL), Pouch Disease Activity Index (PDAI) and BMI were recorded at 
      baseline and following 28 days of elemental diet. Faecal samples were also
      collected at these time points and analysed for major bacterial groups using
      culture independent fluorescence in situ hybridisation. Data were analysed using 
      Wilcoxon's signed-rank test. RESULTS: Following 28 days of exclusive elemental
      diet, median stool frequency decreased from 12 to 6 per day (p=0.028), median
      clinical PDAI decreased from 4 to 1 (p=0.039). There was no significant
      difference in quality of life scores or PDAI before and following treatment.
      There was a trend towards an increase in the concentration of Clostridium
      coccoides-Eubacterium rectale (median 7.9 to 8.5 log(1)(0)/g, p=0.08) following
      exclusive elemental diet. CONCLUSION: Treatment with four weeks elemental diet
      appeared to improve the symptoms of chronic pouchitis in some patients but is not
      an effective strategy for inducing remission. Although a potential symptom
      modifier, elemental diet cannot be recommended for the routine treatment of
      active pouchitis.

PG  - 241-7
LID - 10.4103/1319-3767.98428 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at high risk 
      for low bone mineral density (BMD). This study aimed to evaluate BMD in IBD
      patients and its relationship with bone metabolism in a group of Iranian
      patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on patients
      with IBD to assess BMD status and serum biochemical factors. After getting the
      demographic data from 200 patients, they were screened using dual-energy X-ray
      absorptiometry of the lumbar spine (L2-L4) and femoral neck for BMD status. Serum
      levels of calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and 25-hydroxyvitamin D
      (25-OH vitamin D) were measured to assess the bone metabolism status. RESULTS:
      Two hundred patients with IBD were enrolled in the study. One hundred and eighty 
      three (91.5%) patients were identified as having ulcerative colitis (UC) and 17
      (8.5%) as having Crohn's disease (CD). Based on the lumbar and femoral neck bone 
      mass densitometry, 148 (74.4%) patients had low BMD at either lumbar spine or
      femoral neck. Of these, 100 patients (50.3%) were osteopenic and 48 patients
      (24.1%) were osteoporotic. A 58.6% and 61% of patients with UC had low BMD in the
      lumbar and femoral neck, respectively. These results for those with CD were 76.5%
      and 70.6%, respectively. The mean of femoral neck and lumbar T-scores in patients
      with UC were -1.14 and -1.38, and in patients with CD were -1.24 and -1.47,
      respectively (P > 0.05). The mean (+/-SD) levels for calcium (Ca) in UC and CD
      were in the normal range. The mean (+/-SD) levels of ALP and 25-OH vitamin D in
      both the groups were in the normal range, and in comparison between groups (UC
      and CD), no significant differences were observed (P = 0.20 for ALP and P = 0.44 
      for 25-OH vitamin D). In the assessment of correlation between biochemical
      markers and BMD, an inverse correlation between lumbar T-score and ALP or 25-OH
      vitamin D only in patients with UC was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence
      of low BMD in the Iranian population with IBD needs attention. The subclinical
      vitamin D deficiency may contribute to bone loss in IBD patients, which is more
      pronounced in patients with UC in this study because of the small population of
      patients with CD.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To identify environmental risk factors for developing
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children <15 years of age. METHODS: IBD
      patients and randomly selected healthy controls from a well defined geographical 
      area in Denmark were prospectively recruited in the period 1.1.2007-31.12.2009.
      Data regarding socioeconomic status, area of residence, living conditions,
      infections and diet were obtained by a questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 118 IBD
      patients (59 Crohn's disease (CD), 56 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 3 IBD
      unclassified (IBDU)) and 477 healthy controls filled out the questionnaire. The
      response rates were 91% in patients and 45% in controls, respectively. Several
      risk factors for IBD were identified: IBD in first degree relatives (IBD: OR
      (odds ratio): 6.1 (95%CI: 2.5-15.0), CD (OR: 6.8 (2.3-20.2)) and UC (OR: 6.1
      (2.3-16.0))); bedroom sharing (IBD: OR: 2.1 (1.0-4.3), CD (OR: 3.6 (1.3-9.4)));
      high sugar intake (IBD: OR: 2.5 (1.0-6.2), CD (OR: 2.9 (1.0-8.5))); prior
      admission to a hospital for gastrointestinal infections (IBD: 7.7 (3.1-19.1), CD 
      (7.9 (2.5-24.9)) and UC (7.4 (2.5-21.6))); stressful events (IBD: 1.7 (1.0-2.9)).
      Protective factors were daily vs. less than daily vegetable consumption (CD: 0.3 
      (0.1-1.0), UC (0.3 (0.1-0.8))) and whole meal bread consumption (IBD: OR: 0.5
      (0.3-0.9), CD (0.4 (0.2-0.9))). An increased risk of diagnosis of CD compared to 
      UC was shown for patients living in more urban areas (OR: 1.3 (1.1-1.6)).
      CONCLUSION: We identified several risk and protective factors for developing IBD.
      Studies on the influence of environmental factors are important in our
      understanding of aetiology and phenotypes of paediatric IBD.

LID - 10.1007/s10620-012-2284-3 [doi]
AB  - In vitro and animals models have long been used to study human diseases and
      identify novel therapeutic approaches that can be applied to combat these
      conditions. Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are the two main entities of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). There is an intricate relationship between IBD 
      features in human patients, in vitro and animal colitis models, mechanisms and
      possible therapeutic approaches in these models, and strategies that can be
      extrapolated and applied in humans. Malnutrition, particularly protein-energy
      malnutrition and vitamin and micronutrient deficiencies, as well as dysregulation
      of the intestinal microbiota, are common features of IBD. Based on these
      observations, dietary supplementation with essential nutrients known to be in
      short supply in the diet in IBD patients and with other molecules believed to
      provide beneficial anti-inflammatory effects, as well as with probiotic organisms
      that stimulate immune functions and resistance to infection has been tested in
      colitis models. Here we review current knowledge on nutritional and probiotic
      supplementation in in vitro and animal colitis models. While some of these
      strategies require further fine-tuning before they can be applied in human IBD
      patients, their intended purpose is to prevent, delay or treat disease symptoms
      in a non-pharmaceutical manner.

PG  - 732-8
LID - 10.1016/j.mayocp.2012.06.003 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report the response to discontinuation of olmesartan, an
      angiotensin II receptor antagonist commonly prescribed for treatment of
      hypertension, in patients with unexplained severe spruelike enteropathy. PATIENTS
      AND METHODS: All 22 patients included in this report were seen at Mayo Clinic in 
      Rochester, Minnesota, between August 1, 2008, and August 1, 2011, for evaluation 
      of unexplained chronic diarrhea and enteropathy while taking olmesartan. Celiac
      disease was ruled out in all cases. To be included in the study, the patients
      also had to have clinical improvement after suspension of olmesartan. RESULTS:
      The 22 patients (13 women) had a median age of 69.5 years (range, 47-81 years).
      Most patients were taking 40 mg/d of olmesartan (range, 10-40 mg/d). The clinical
      presentation was of chronic diarrhea and weight loss (median, 18 kg; range,
      2.5-57 kg), which required hospitalization in 14 patients (64%). Intestinal
      biopsies showed both villous atrophy and variable degrees of mucosal inflammation
      in 15 patients, and marked subepithelial collagen deposition (collagenous sprue) 
      in 7. Tissue transglutaminase antibodies were not detected. A gluten-free diet
      was not helpful. Collagenous or lymphocytic gastritis was documented in 7
      patients, and microscopic colitis was documented in 5 patients. Clinical
      response, with a mean weight gain of 12.2 kg, was demonstrated in all cases.
      Histologic recovery or improvement of the duodenum after discontinuation of
      olmesartan was confirmed in all 18 patients who underwent follow-up biopsies.
      CONCLUSION: Olmesartan may be associated with a severe form of spruelike
      enteropathy. Clinical response and histologic recovery are expected after
      suspension of the drug.

PG  - 29-44
LID - 10.1016/j.trsl.2011.09.001 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) encompassed several chronic inflammatory
      disorders leading to damage of the gastrointestinal tract (GI). The 2 principal
      forms of these disorders are ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD).
      Bacteria are involved in the etiology of IBD, and the genetic susceptibility,
      environmental factors, and lifestyle factors can affect the individual's
      predisposition to IBD. The review discusses the potential role of environmental
      factors such as diet and microbiota as well as genetics in the etiology of IBD.
      It is suggested that microbial ecosystem in the human bowel colonizing the gut in
      many different microhabitats can be influence by diet, leading to formation of
      metabolic processes that are essential form the bowel metabolism.

AB  - Differences in the composition of the gut microbial community have been
      associated with diseases such as obesity, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and
      colorectal cancer (CRC). We used 454 titanium pyrosequencing of the V1-V2 region 
      of the 16S rRNA gene to characterize adherent bacterial communities in mucosal
      biopsy samples from 33 subjects with adenomas and 38 subjects without adenomas
      (controls). Biopsy samples from subjects with adenomas had greater numbers of
      bacteria from 87 taxa than controls; only 5 taxa were more abundant in control
      samples. The magnitude of the differences in the distal gut microbiota between
      patients with adenomas and controls was more pronounced than that of any other
      clinical parameters including obesity, diet or family history of CRC. This
      suggests that sequence analysis of the microbiota could be used to identify
      patients at risk for developing adenomas.

TI  - Paediatric nutrition risk scores in clinical practice: children with inflammatory

PG  - 319-22

AB  - BACKGROUND: There has been increasing interest in the use of nutrition risk
      assessment tools in paediatrics to identify those who need nutrition support.
      Four non-disease specific screening tools have been developed, although there is 
      a paucity of data on their application in clinical practice and the degree of
      inter-tool agreement. METHODS: The concurrent validity of four nutrition
      screening tools [Screening Tool for the Assessment of Malnutrition in Paediatrics
      (STAMP), Screening Tool for Risk On Nutritional status and Growth (STRONGkids),
      Paediatric Yorkhill Malnutrition Score (PYMS) and Simple Paediatric Nutrition
      Risk Score (PNRS)] was examined in 46 children with inflammatory bowel disease.
      Degree of malnutrition was determined by anthropometry alone using World Health
      Organization International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) criteria. RESULTS:
      There was good agreement between STAMP, STRONGkids and PNRS (kappa > 0.6) but
      there was only modest agreement between PYMS and the other scores (kappa = 0.3). 
      No children scored low risk with STAMP, STRONGkids or PNRS; however, 23 children 
      scored low risk with PYMS. There was no agreement between the risk tools and the 
      degree of malnutrition based on anthropometric data (kappa < 0.1). Three children
      had anthropometry consistent with malnutrition and these were all scored high
      risk. Four children had body mass index SD scores < -2, one of which was scored
      at low nutrition risk. CONCLUSIONS: The relevance of nutrition screening tools
      for children with chronic disease is unclear. In addition, there is the potential
      to under recognise nutritional impairment (and therefore nutritional risk) in
      children with inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Aspects in the interdisciplinary decision-making for surgical intervention in
      ulcerative colitis and its complications.
PG  - 468-74
LID - 10.1055/s-0031-1299467 [doi]
AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammation of the large bowel,
      predominantly affecting young adults of 20 to 30 years of age. Even though the
      majority of patients with limited and extensive UC can be managed medically, 20
      to 30 % will require surgical intervention at some point in their life to gain
      control of the inflammatory process. The most common reason for urgent and
      emergency surgery is a lack of response to maximal medical inpatient therapy
      after five to ten days. Other indications include hemorrhage, free perforation,
      sepsis, and toxic megacolon. Procedure of choice for the majority of surgeons is 
      open or laparoscopic subtotal colectomy and end ileostomy, with or without
      exteriorization of the rectal stump. The laparoscopic approach requires more
      time, but allows for faster return of bowel function and discharge from the
      hospital. Creation of a definite restoration in form of a J pouch should be
      delayed for at least three months. Indications for elective surgical intervention
      include cancer, dysplasia associated lesion or mass, and stricture. Preferably,
      the J pouch and Brooke ileostomy are performed in two stages, with a takedown of 
      the ileostomy several months later. A single-stage operation is associated with
      increased anastomotic dehiscence, sepsis, and long-term pouch failure. The
      laparoscopic creation of a J pouch is largely dependent on the surgeon's
      experience, but results in a number of advantages, including faster return of
      bowel function, tolerance of diet, and discharge. Regardless of emergency,
      urgent, or elective surgical intervention, early involvement of a team of
      gastroenterologist, surgeon, nutritionist, and stoma nurse is essential in the
      management of severe UC to maximize a satisfactory patient outcome.

TI  - Advances in inflammatory bowel diseases in children.
PG  - 257-70
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic gastrointestinal condition that
      burdens the lives of many children around the world. It is characterized by
      chronic gastrointestinal inflammation. Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis
      and IBD-unknown are the three types of this disease. The management of children
      with inflammatory bowel disease is complex and requires skill, knowledge and
      experience with current advances in the field. Over the past several years, there
      have been a number of achievements and progress made in the care and management
      of this disorder. The diagnostic tools have greatly improved. The therapeutic
      armamentarium has expanded. The genetics of IBD has become more detailed and the 
      role of the gut microbiome has been better defined. The evolution of biological
      agents has revolutionized the way we approach this disease. This review
      highlights the recent advances in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease and
      provides an overview for clinicians caring for children with this disorder.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of Profermin(R) to induce remission in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1773-80
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v18.i15.1773 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To test the efficacy and safety of Profermin((R)) in inducing remission in
      patients with active ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: The study included 39
      patients with mild to moderate UC defined as a Simple Clinical Colitis Activity
      Index (SCCAI) > 4 and < 12 (median: 7.5), who were treated open-label with
      Profermin((R)) twice daily for 24 wk. Daily SCCAI was reported observer blinded
      via the Internet. RESULTS: In an intention to treat (ITT) analysis, the mean
      reduction in SCCAI score was 56.5%. Of the 39 patients, 24 (62%) reached the
      primary endpoint, which was proportion of patients with >/= 50% reduction in
      SCCAI. Our secondary endpoint, the proportion of patients in remission defined as
      SCCAI </= 2.5, was in ITT analysis reached in 18 of the 39 patients (46%). In a
      repeated-measure regression analysis, the estimated mean reduction in score was
      5.0 points (95% CI: 4.1-5.9, P < 0.001) and the estimated mean time taken to
      obtain half the reduction in score was 28 d (95% CI: 26-30). There were no
      serious adverse events (AEs) or withdrawals due to AEs. Profermin((R)) was
      generally well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Profermin((R)) is safe and may be effective
      in inducing remission of active UC.

AB  - The intestinal microbiota has been linked to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD),
      and oral treatment with specific bacteria can ameliorate IBD. One bacterial
      mixture, VSL#3, containing Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Streptococcus, was
      clinically shown to reduce inflammation in IBD patients and normalize intestinal 
      levels of IP-10, a lymphocyte-recruiting chemokine, in a murine colitis model. We
      identified Lactobacillus paracasei prtP-encoded lactocepin as a protease that
      selectively degrades secreted, cell-associated, and tissue-distributed IP-10,
      resulting in significantly reduced lymphocyte recruitment after intraperitoneal
      injection in an ileitis model. A human Lactobacillus casei isolate was also found
      to encode lactocepin and degrade IP-10. L. casei feeding studies in a murine
      colitis model (T cell transferred Rag2(-/-) mice) revealed that a prtP-disruption
      mutant was significantly less potent in reducing IP-10 levels, T cell
      infiltration and inflammation in cecal tissue compared to the isogenic wild-type 
      strain. Thus, lactocepin-based therapies may be effective treatments for
      chemokine-mediated diseases like IBD.

AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD), collectively referred to as
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are chronic inflammatory disorders that can
      affect the gastrointestinal tract of children and adults. Like other autoimmune
      processes, the cause(s) of these disorders remain unknown but likely involves
      some interplay between genetic vulnerability and environmental factors. Children,
      in particular with UC or CD, can present to their primary care providers with
      similar symptoms, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and bloody
      stool. Although UC and CD are more predominant in adults, epidemiologic studies
      have demonstrated that a significant percentage of these patients were diagnosed 
      during childhood. The chronic nature of the inflammatory process observed in
      these children and the waxing and waning nature of their clinical symptoms can be
      especially disruptive to their physical, social, and academic development. As
      such, physicians caring for children must consider these diseases when evaluating
      patients with compatible symptoms. Recent research efforts have made available a 
      variety of more specific and effective pharmacologic agents and improved
      endoscopic and radiologic assessment tools to assist clinicians in the diagnosis 
      and interval assessment of their patients with IBD; however, as the level of
      complexity of these interventions has increased, so too has the need for
      practitioners to become familiar with a wider array of treatments and the risks
      and benefits of particular diagnostic testing. Nonetheless, in most cases, and
      especially when frequent visits to subspecialty referral centers are not
      geographically feasible, primary care providers can be active participants in the
      management of their pediatric patients with IBD. The goal of this article is to
      educate and assist pediatricians and adult gastroenterology physicians caring for
      children with IBD, and in doing so, help to develop more collaborative care plans
      between primary care and subspecialty providers.

PG  - 1266-80

AB  - The incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn's
      disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are lower in Asia than in the West.
      However, across Asia the incidence and prevalence of IBD has increased rapidly
      over the last two to four decades. These changes may relate to increased contact 
      with the West, westernization of diet, increasing antibiotics use, improved
      hygiene, vaccinations, or changes in the gut microbiota. Genetic factors also
      differ between Asians and the Caucasians. In Asia, UC is more prevalent than CD, 
      although CD incidence is rapidly increasing in certain areas. There is a male
      predominance of CD in Asia, but a trend towards equal sex distribution for UC.
      IBD is diagnosed at a slightly older age than in the West, and there is rarely a 
      second incidence peak as in the West. A positive family history is much less
      common than in the West, as are extra-intestinal disease manifestations. There
      are clear ethnic differences in incidence within countries in Asia, and an
      increased incidence in IBD in migrants from Asia to the West. Research in Asia,
      an area of rapidly changing IBD epidemiology, may lead to the discovery of
      critical etiologic factors that lead to the development of IBD.

TI  - Role of nutrition and microbiota in susceptibility to inflammatory bowel
      diseases.
PG  - 524-35
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201100630 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), Crohn's disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis 
      (UC) are chronic inflammatory conditions, which are increasing in incidence,
      prevalence, and severity, in many countries. While there is genetic
      susceptibility to IBD, the probability of disease development is modified by
      diet, lifestyle, and endogenous factors, including the gut microbiota. For
      example, high intakes of mono- and disaccharides, and total fats consistently
      increases the risk developing both forms of IBD. High vegetable intake reduces
      the risk of UC, whereas increased fruit and/or dietary fiber intake appears
      protective against CD. Low levels of certain micronutrients, especially vitamin
      D, may increase the risk of both diseases. Dietary patterns may be even more
      important to disease susceptibility than the levels of individual foods or
      nutrients. Various dietary regimes may modify disease symptoms, in part through
      their actions on the host microbiota. Both probiotics and prebiotics may modulate
      the microflora, and reduce the likelihood of IBD regression. However, other
      dietary factors affect the microbiota in different ways. Distinguishing cause
      from effect, and characterizing the relative roles of human and microbial genes, 
      diet, age of onset, gender, life style, smoking history, ethnic background,
      environmental exposures, and medications, will require innovative and
      internationally integrated approaches.

AB  - AIM: To investigate all patients referred to our center with non-responsive
      celiac disease (NRCD), to establish a cause for their continued symptoms.
      METHODS: We assessed all patients referred to our center with non-responsive
      celiac disease over an 18-mo period. These individuals were investigated to
      establish the eitiology of their continued symptoms. The patients were first seen
      in clinic where a thorough history and examination were performed with routine
      blood work including tissue transglutaminase antibody measurement. They were also
      referred to a specialist gastroenterology dietician to try to identift any lapses
      in the diet and sources of hidden gluten ingestion. A repeat small intestinal
      biopsy was also performed and compared to biopsies from the referring hospital
      where possible. Colonoscopy, lactulose hydrogen breath testing, pancreolauryl
      testing and computed tomography scan of the abdomen were undertaken if the
      symptoms persisted. Their clinical progress was followed over a minimum of 2
      years. RESULTS: One hundred and twelve consecutive patients were referred with
      NRCD. Twelve were found not to have celiac disease (CD). Of the remaining 100
      patients, 45% were not adequately adhering to a strict gluten-free diet, with 24 
      (53%) found to be inadvertently ingesting gluten, and 21 (47%) admitting
      non-compliance. Microscopic colitis was diagnosed in 12% and small bowel
      bacterial overgrowth in 9%. Refractory CD was diagnosed in 9%. Three of these
      were diagnosed with intestinal lymphoma. After 2 years, 78 patients remained
      well, eight had continuing symptoms, and four had died. CONCLUSION: In
      individuals with NRCD, a remediable cause can be found in 90%: with continued
      gluten ingestion as the leading cause. We propose an algorithm for investigation.

AB  - First defined in the mid-1990s, prebiotics, which alter the composition and
      activity of gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota to improve health and well-being,
      have generated scientific and consumer interest and regulatory debate. The Life
      Sciences Research Organization, Inc. (LSRO) held a workshop, Prebiotics and the
      Health Benefits of Fiber: Future Research and Goals, in February 2011 to assess
      the current state of the science and the international regulatory environment for
      prebiotics, identify research gaps, and create a strategy for future research. A 
      developing body of evidence supports a role for prebiotics in reducing the risk
      and severity of GI infection and inflammation, including diarrhea, inflammatory
      bowel disease, and ulcerative colitis as well as bowel function disorders,
      including irritable bowel syndrome. Prebiotics also increase the bioavailability 
      and uptake of minerals and data suggest that they reduce the risk of obesity by
      promoting satiety and weight loss. Additional research is needed to define the
      relationship between the consumption of different prebiotics and improvement of
      human health. New information derived from the characterization of the
      composition and function of different prebiotics as well as the interactions
      among and between gut microbiota and the human host would improve our
      understanding of the effects of prebiotics on health and disease and could assist
      in surmounting regulatory issues related to prebiotic use.

TI  - [Deficient lactose digestion and intolerance in a group of patients with chronic 
      nonspecific ulcerative colitis: a controlled, double-blind, cross-over clinical
      trial].
PG  - 26-30
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Despite the fact that the frequency of hypolactasia and lactose
      intolerance is similar in both chronic idiopathic ulcerative colitis patients and
      the general population, the elimination of dairy products from the patient's diet
      is a habitual recommendation. Hypolactasia is common in Mexico, but its relation 
      to chronic idiopathic ulcerative colitis has not been established. AIMS: To
      evaluate lactose digestion and lactose intolerance in persons with chronic
      idiopathic ulcerative colitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with
      confirmed chronic idiopathic ulcerative colitis diagnosis were included in the
      study (mean: 31 years, range: 15 to 38). Twenty-two patients presented with
      rectosigmoid involvement and the remaining patients with pancolitis. No patient
      showed inflammatory activity according to the Truelove-Witts criteria and all
      consumed dairy products before diagnosis. A prospective, controlled,
      double-blind, cross-over study was designed. Patients randomly received 12.5 g of
      lactose or maltose in 250 cc water- each test 72 hours apart - and ydrogen was
      measured in exhaled air before disaccharide ingestion and then every 30 minutes
      for 3 hours. Digestion was considered deficient when there was an increase in
      hydrogen of at least 20 ppm. Symptom intensities were evaluated by Visual Analog 
      Scales before, during, and after the hydrogen test. Differences between the
      groups were contrasted with the Mann-Whitney U and the Wilcoxon tests. RESULTS:
      Eighteen patients (46%) presented with deficient lactose digestion. No
      significant differences were found in the symptoms, extension, or progression of 
      chronic idiopathic ulcerative colitis between patients that could digest and
      those that could not digest lactose. No patient had symptom exacerbation with the
      disaccharides used. CONCLUSIONS: Lactose digestion deficiency frequency is
      similar in subjects with chronic idiopathic ulcerative colitis and in healthy
      individuals in Mexico. We do not know whether higher doses could have some
      effect, but symptoms in patients with inactive chronic idiopathic ulcerative
      colitis were not modified using 12.5 g of lactose/day.

TI  - Goblet cells deliver luminal antigen to CD103+ dendritic cells in the small
      intestine.
PG  - 345-9
LID - 10.1038/nature10863 [doi]
AB  - The intestinal immune system is exposed to a mixture of foreign antigens from
      diet, commensal flora and potential pathogens. Understanding how
      pathogen-specific immunity is elicited while avoiding inappropriate responses to 
      the background of innocuous antigens is essential for understanding and treating 
      intestinal infections and inflammatory diseases. The ingestion of protein antigen
      can induce oral tolerance, which is mediated in part by a subset of intestinal
      dendritic cells (DCs) that promote the development of regulatory T cells. The
      lamina propria (LP) underlies the expansive single-cell absorptive villous
      epithelium and contains a large population of DCs (CD11c(+) CD11b(+) MHCII(+)
      cells) comprised of two predominant subsets: CD103(+) CX(3)CR1(-) DCs, which
      promote IgA production, imprint gut homing on lymphocytes and induce the
      development of regulatory T cells, and CD103(-) CX(3)CR1(+) DCs (with features of
      macrophages), which promote tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) production, 
      colitis, and the development of T(H)17 T cells. However, the mechanisms by which 
      different intestinal LP-DC subsets capture luminal antigens in vivo remains
      largely unexplored. Using a minimally disruptive in vivo imaging approach we show
      that in the steady state, small intestine goblet cells (GCs) function as passages
      delivering low molecular weight soluble antigens from the intestinal lumen to
      underlying CD103(+) LP-DCs. The preferential delivery of antigens to DCs with
      tolerogenic properties implies a key role for this GC function in intestinal
      immune homeostasis.

TI  - Peracetylated (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (AcEGCG) potently suppresses dextran
      sulfate sodium-induced colitis and colon tumorigenesis in mice.
PG  - 3441-51
LID - 10.1021/jf300441p [doi]
AB  - Previous studies reported that peracetylated (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate
      (AcEGCG) has antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory activities. Here, we
      evaluated the chemopreventive effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of
      dietary administration of AcEGCG and EGCG in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced
      colitis in mice. The mice were fed a diet supplemented with either AcEGCG or EGCG
      prior to DSS induction. Our results indicated that AcEGCG administration was more
      effective than EGCG in preventing the shortening of colon length and the
      formation of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) and lymphoid nodules (LN) in mouse colon
      stimulated by DSS. Our study observes that AcEGCG treatment inhibited histone 3
      lysine 9 (H3K9) acetylation but did not affect histone acetyltransferase (HAT)
      activity and acetyl- CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300 levels. In addition,
      pretreatment with AcEGCG decreased the proinflammatory mediator levels by
      down-regulating of PI3K/Akt/NFkappaB phosphorylation and p65 acetylation. We also
      found that treatment with AcEGCG increased heme oxygenase-1(HO-1) expression via 
      activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK)1/2 signaling
      and acetylation of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), thereby abating DSS-induced
      colitis. Moreover, dietary feeding with AcEGCG markedly reduced colitis-driven
      colon cancer in mice. Taken together, these results demonstrated for the first
      time the in vivo chemopreventive efficacy and molecular mechanisms of dietary
      AcEGCG against inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and potentially colon cancer
      associated with colitis. These findings provide insight into the biological
      actions of AcEGCG and might establish a molecular basis for the development of
      new cancer chemopreventive agents.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Physical activity is important for muscle and bone strength 
      in the growing child and may be impaired in paediatric patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) even during quiescent disease. The SenseWearPro(2) armband
      allows to measure physical activity under everyday life conditions. METHODS:
      Thirty-nine IBD patients (27 Crohn's disease, 12 ulcerative colitis, 24 boys) in 
      remission (n=26) or with only mild disease activity (n=13) were compared to 39
      healthy age and sex-matched controls. Body weight, height, body mass index (BMI),
      lean body mass as phase angle alpha (determined by bioelectrical impedance
      analysis), and dynamometric grip force were expressed as age- and sex-related
      Z-scores. SenseWearPro(2) armbands were applied for three consecutive days to
      record number of steps, duration of physical activity and sleeping time. Quality 
      of life was assessed with the German KINDL and IMPACT III questionnaires, energy 
      intake with prospective food protocols. Differences between patients and
      pair-matched controls were analysed by paired t-test. RESULTS: Patients showed
      lower Z-scores for phase angle alpha (difference -0.72; 95% CI [-1.10; -0.34])
      and lower grip strength (-1.02 [-1.58; -0.47]) than controls. They tended towards
      lesser number of steps per day (-1339 [-2760; 83]) and shorter duration of
      physical activity (-0.44 h [-0.94; 0.06]), particularly in females and patients
      with mild disease. Quality of life and energy intake did not differ between
      patients and controls. CONCLUSION: In spite of quiescent disease lean body mass
      and physical activity were reduced. Interventions to encourage physical activity 
      may be beneficial in this lifelong disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Anaemia and iron deficiency are common in children with
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) however it is not known if the prevalence of
      anaemia and iron deficiency alters following diagnosis. METHODS: Laboratory
      results from diagnosis, and at follow up one and two years later were recorded
      retrospectively in children with IBD recruited from a tertiary centre. Anaemia
      was defined using WHO standards and iron deficiency defined using published
      guidelines. RESULTS: 46 children (16 girls) with Crohn's disease and 34 children 
      (18 girls) with UC were studied. 75% of children with IBD were anaemic at
      diagnosis, 30% were anaemic at follow up two years later. 90% of children with
      Crohn's and 95% of children with Ulcerative Colitis (UC) were iron deficient at
      diagnosis. At follow up two years later 70% of children with Crohn's and 65% of
      children with UC were iron deficient. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent anaemia and iron
      deficiency are common in childhood IBD, prevalence alters with duration of time
      from diagnosis.

AB  - A 29-year-old man presented with abdominal cramps and bloody diarrhoea. Blood
      tests revealed elevated C-reactive protein (21.3 mg/dL; normal range 0.01 - 0. 82
      mg/dL) and white blood cells (28200/muL, normal range 4000 - 10000/muL). Stool
      tests were negative for enteropathogenic bacteria and Clostridium difficile
      toxins A/B. Ultrasound and computed tomography showed massive swelling of the
      transverse colon and right colonic flexure. At endoscopy, circular necrosis of
      the mucosa was encountered in the proximal segments of the colon whereas distal
      parts of the organ showed patchy inflammation of minor severity. Extended stool
      testing identified Escherichia coli type O104:H4 as the causative microorganism. 
      There was no evidence for haemolytic uraemic syndrome. Under conservative
      treatment the patient recovered clinically, serologically and endoscopically. At 
      follow-up endoscopy, longitudinal ulcers and vital mucosa were present. In this
      case report the segmental pattern of mucosal necrosis in a patient with EHEC
      infection is noteworthy.

TI  - Development of an internet-based cohort of patients with inflammatory bowel
      diseases (CCFA Partners): methodology and initial results.
PG  - 2099-106
LID - 10.1002/ibd.22895 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The widespread use of the Internet allows for unique research
      opportunities. We aimed to develop and follow an Internet-based cohort (e-cohort)
      of patients with self-reported inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) over time.
      METHODS: We established an e-cohort of adults with IBD (CCFA Partners) by
      recruiting through Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA) email
      rosters, CCFA Website promotion, social media, and other publicity mechanisms.
      The baseline survey included modules on disease course and activity, diet and
      exercise, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Baseline characteristics of the
      cohort are summarized using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: A total of 7819
      adults with IBD joined CCFA Partners through August, 2011. The median age was 42 
      years (interquartile range [IQR] 30-54), 5074 (72.3%) were female. A total of
      4933 (63.1%) had Crohn's disease (CD), 2675 (34.2%) had ulcerative colitis (UC), 
      and 211 (2.7%) had IBD unspecified. For CD, the mean short CD Activity Index
      (CDAI) was 151.9 (standard deviation [SD] 106.4), with 2274 (59.4%) in remission.
      For UC, the mean simple clinical colitis activity index (SCCAI) was 3.6 (SD 2.8),
      with 937 (42.9%) in remission. The mean short IBD questionnaire (SIBDQ) score was
      48.7 (SD 11.8). SIBDQ was inversely correlated with disease activity (P < 0.01). 
      The mean Morisky medication adherence score (MMAS) was 5.7 (SD 2.0). MMAS scores 
      were inversely correlated with disease activity (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: CCFA
      Partners is a novel e-cohort. Enrollment is ongoing, with surveys twice yearly.
      CCFA Partners represents a unique resource to study PROs and changes in disease
      management over time.

TI  - Probiotics as an alternative strategy for prevention and treatment of human
      diseases: a review.
PG  - 79-89
AB  - Probiotics are live microbial food supplements or their components, which have
      been shown to have beneficial effects on human health. Probiotics can be
      bacteria, molds, or yeasts, but most of them fall into the group known as lactic 
      acid bacteria and are normally consumed in the form of yogurt, fermented milk, or
      other fermented foods. Data from clinical trials have shown contrasting effects
      and should be interpreted with caution. A large variety of potential beneficial
      effects have been reported including improvement of intestinal tract health,
      enhancing the immune system, reducing symptoms of lactose intolerance, decreasing
      the prevalence of allergy in susceptible individuals, reducing risk of certain
      cancers, treating colitis, lowering serum cholesterol concentrations, reducing
      blood pressure in hypertensives, and improving female urogenital infections and
      Helicobacter pylori infections. The aim of this article is to present a review of
      the current expanding knowledge of applications of utilizing probiotic
      microorganisms in the prevention and treatment of several diseases.

      colitis?].
PG  - 1029-33
AB  - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis belong to an autoimmune mediated,
      civilizing diseases having a rise of incidence. The cause of both disease is
      still unknown with undoubted importance of diet, a lifestyle and using
      ofantimicrobial drugs in the last fifty years. The rational therapy is based to
      use the drugs with high anti-inflammatory efficacy. The choice of therapy is
      driven due to disease course in individual patient. The integral part of patients
      follow up are activities directing to minimize of drug's side effects.

      questionnaire-based survey.
PG  - 29-42
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2011.06.007 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Environmental factors may play an important role in the
      pathogenesis of IBD. The history of patients of the German IBD twin study was
      analyzed by questionnaires and interviews. METHODS: Randomly selected German
      monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins with at least one sibling suffering
      from IBD (n=512) were characterized in detail including demography, medical
      history and concomitant medications. Controls comprised of non-twin IBD patients 
      (n=392) and healthy subjects (n=207). RESULTS: The most significant variables
      that were associated with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC)
      included living abroad before time of diagnosis (OR, 4.32; 95% CI, 1.57-13.69),
      high frequency of antibiotic use (MZ CD OR, 5.03; 95% CI 1.61-17.74, DZ CD OR,
      7.66; 95% CI, 3.63-16.82, MZ UC OR, 3.82; 95% CI, 1.45-10.56, DZ UC OR, 3.08; CI,
      1.63-5.92), high consumption of processed meat including sausage (MZ CD OR, 7.9; 
      95% CI, 2.15-38.12, DZ CD OR, 10.75; 95% CI, 4.82-25.55, MZ UC OR, 5.69; 95% CI, 
      1.89-19.48, DZ UC OR, 18.11; 95% CI, 7.34-50.85), and recall of bacterial
      gastrointestinal infections (MZ CD OR, 15.9; 95% CI, 4.33-77.14, DZ CD OR, 17.21;
      95% CI, 4.47-112.5, MZ UC OR, 5.87; 95% CI, 1.61-28.0, DZ UC OR, 11.34; 95% CI,
      4.81-29.67). CONCLUSIONS: This study reinforced the association of life style
      events, in particular a specific dietary and infections history, with IBD.
      Alteration of gut flora or alterations of the mucosal immune system in reactivity
      to the flora could be an important factor to explain the relationship between
      life-style and disease.

AB  - Modulation of intestinal microbiota by non-digestible carbohydrates may reduce
      inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of the present study
      was to assess the effects of inulin and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) on
      intestinal microbiota and colitis in HLA-B27 transgenic rats, a well-validated
      rodent model for IBD. In this study, 4-week-old rats were fed 8 g/kg body weight 
      inulin or FOS for 12 weeks, or not. Faeces were collected at 4 and 16 weeks of
      age; and caecal samples were collected at necropsy. The effects of inulin and FOS
      on chronic intestinal inflammation were assessed using a gross gut score,
      histology score and levels of mucosal IL-1beta. Intestinal microbiota were
      characterised by quantitative PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
      Colitis was significantly reduced in all FOS-fed rats compared to the control
      diet, whereas inulin decreased chronic intestinal inflammation in only half the
      number of animals. Quantitative analysis of caecal microbiota demonstrated that
      inulin increased the numbers of total bacteria and the
      Bacteroides-Prevotella-Porphyromonas group, FOS increased bifidobacteria, and
      both fructans decreased Clostridium cluster XI. In the faecal samples, both
      inulin and FOS decreased total bacteria, Bacteroides-Prevotella-Porphyromonas
      group, and Clostridium clusters XI and XIVa. FOS increased Bifidobacterium spp., 
      and mediated a decrease of gene copies of Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridium
      difficile toxin B in faeces. SCFA concentrations in the faecal and caecal samples
      were unaffected by the diets. In conclusion, FOS increased the abundance of
      Bifidobacterium spp., whereas both fructans reduced Clostridium cluster XI and C.
      difficile toxin gene expression, correlating with a reduction of chronic
      intestinal inflammation.

TI  - Lipid rafts are disrupted in mildly inflamed intestinal microenvironments without
      overt disruption of the epithelial barrier.
PG  - G781-93
LID - 10.1152/ajpgi.00002.2011 [doi]
AB  - Intestinal epithelial barrier disruption is a feature of inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD), but whether barrier disruption precedes or merely accompanies
      inflammation remains controversial. Tight junction (TJ) adhesion complexes
      control epithelial barrier integrity. Since some TJ proteins reside in
      cholesterol-enriched regions of the cell membrane termed lipid rafts, we sought
      to elucidate the relationship between rafts and intestinal epithelial barrier
      function. Lipid rafts were isolated from Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells
      primed with the proinflammatory cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) or treated 
      with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin as a positive control for raft disruption. Rafts
      were also isolated from the ilea of mice in which colitis had been induced in
      conjunction with in vivo intestinal permeability measurements, and lastly from
      intestinal biopsies of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients with predominantly mild
      or quiescent disease. Raft distribution was analyzed by measuring activity of the
      raft-associated enzyme alkaline phosphatase and by performing Western blot
      analysis for flotillin-1. Epithelial barrier integrity was estimated by measuring
      transepithelial resistance in cytokine-treated cells or in vivo permeability to
      fluorescent dextran in colitic mice. Raft and nonraft fractions were analyzed by 
      Western blotting for the TJ proteins occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Our 
      results revealed that lipid rafts were disrupted in IFN-gamma-treated cells, in
      the ilea of mice with subclinical colitis, and in UC patients with quiescent
      inflammation. This was not associated with a clear pattern of occludin or ZO-1
      relocalization from raft to nonraft fractions. Significantly, a time-course study
      in colitic mice revealed that disruption of lipid rafts preceded the onset of
      increased intestinal permeability. Our data suggest for the first time that lipid
      raft disruption occurs early in the inflammatory cascade in murine and human
      colitis and, we speculate, may contribute to subsequent disruption of epithelial 
      barrier function.

TI  - T-pouch: results of the first 10 years with a nonintussuscepting continent
      ileostomy.
PG  - 155-62
LID - 10.1097/DCR.0b013e31823a969b [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Continent ileostomy is an alternative for patients who are either not
      candidates for an ileo-anal pullthrough or in whom an ileo-anal pullthrough
      failed. We previously described a new type of continent ileostomy (T-pouch) with 
      a nonintussuscepting valve. OBJECTIVE: This study performed an outcomes analysis 
      of the first 10 years with 40 patients. DESIGN: A prospective database of
      patients with a T-pouch from 2000 to 2010 was retrospectively analyzed. MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes measured were demographics and surgical
      recovery information and the functional data obtained via questionnaire:
      incontinence, difficulty of pouch intubation, restrictions (work, social, diet,
      and sexual), quality of health and life, and level of satisfaction with surgery, 
      which were rated on a scale of 0 to 10. RESULTS: Twenty-three women and 17 men
      (mean age, 51.2) received a T-pouch. Median follow-up was 6.2 years (range,
      0.8-11 years). Five patients (12.5%) experience a leak; 3 leaks were managed
      conservatively and/or with drain placement. Pouch intubations were done 4 times
      per day in a mean of 6.8 minutes; the insertion difficulty was rated as 2.5 of
      10. Ninety-two percent achieved good continence. All quality-of-life and
      dysfunction/restriction scores showed significant improvement. Major abdominal
      surgeries for pouch-related reasons were needed in 30%; minor service operations 
      of the skin-level stoma were needed in 25% of the patients. Of the patients,
      87.5% would do the surgery again; 90% would recommend it to others with the same 
      diagnosis. LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by the cohort size and the lack of
      long-term data. CONCLUSION: Ten years with 40 patients confirmed that creation of
      a T-pouch is complex but could be performed with an acceptable rate of
      complications. It dramatically improved functional outcomes; most notably, it
      improved fecal control and decreased social, sexual, and work restrictions.

AB  - The endocannabinoid system has been extensively investigated in experimental
      colitis and inflammatory bowel disease, but not in celiac disease, where only a
      single study showed increased levels of the major endocannabinoid anandamide in
      the atrophic mucosa. On this basis, we aimed to investigate anandamide metabolism
      in celiac disease by analyzing transcript levels (through quantitative real-time 
      reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction), protein concentration (through 
      immunoblotting) and activity (through radioassays) of enzymes responsible for
      anandamide synthesis (N-acylphosphatidyl-ethanolamine specific phospholipase D,
      NAPE-PLD) and degradation (fatty acid amide hydrolase, FAAH) in the duodenal
      mucosa of untreated celiac patients, celiac patients on a gluten-free diet for at
      least 12 months and control subjects. Also, treated celiac biopsies cultured ex
      vivo with peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin were investigated. Our in vivo
      experiments showed that mucosal NAPE-PLD expression and activity are higher in
      untreated celiac patients than treated celiac patients and controls, with no
      significant difference between the latter two groups. In keeping with the in vivo
      data, the ex vivo activity of NAPE-PLD was significantly enhanced by incubation
      of peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin with treated celiac biopsies. On the
      contrary, in vivo mucosal FAAH expression and activity did not change in the
      three groups of patients, and accordingly, mucosal FAAH activity was not
      influenced by treatment with peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin. In conclusion, our
      findings provide a possible pathophysiological explanation for the increased
      anandamide concentration previously shown in active celiac mucosa.

TI  - Glucans from the edible mushroom Pleurotus pulmonarius inhibit colitis-associated
      colon carcinogenesis in mice.
PG  - 504-18
LID - 10.1007/s00535-011-0514-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We have recently demonstrated that polysaccharides from fruiting body
      extract (FBE) or mycelia extract (ME) of the edible mushroom Pleurotus
      pulmonarius exert antiproliferative effects in intestinal cells and an
      anti-inflammatory effect in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse model of acute
      colitis. The aim of this study was to assess the role of fungal FBE and ME in
      colon carcinogenesis. METHODS: In vitro, human colorectal cancer cells were
      treated with FBE and ME and analyzed for inflammation response, for markers of
      apoptosis, and for cell-cycle progression. In vivo, FBE and ME were tested in a
      mouse model of colitis-associated colorectal carcinogenesis induced by cyclic
      treatments with DSS and azoxymethane. Treated mice were fed a daily diet
      containing 2 or 20 mg FBE or ME per mouse for 80 days. RESULTS: In vitro, FBE and
      ME induced apoptosis in a dose-responsive manner and modulated the expression of 
      Bcl-2, Bax, and cytochrome c, and blocked tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF)-alpha-induced inhibitor of nuclear factor (NF) (Ikappa)-Balpha degradation 
      and NF-kappaB nuclear translocation. In vivo, dietary administration of FBE and
      ME significantly reduced the formation of aberrant crypt foci, which precedes
      colorectal cancer, and of microadenomas. The treatments significantly lowered the
      expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and increased the number of
      cells undergoing apoptosis in the colon. Additionally, FBE and ME inhibited the
      expression of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha in colonic tissue.
      CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that P. pulmonarius FBE and ME inhibit
      colitis-associated colon carcinogenesis induced in mice through the modulation of
      cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and inhibition of inflammation.

AB  - Enteric granulomatous inflammation can be caused by a number of conditions
      including Crohn's disease, sarcoidosis, enteric infections, chronic granulomatous
      disease and also by drug reactions. Granulomas have also been described in
      microscopic colitis associated with certain medications and autoimmune diseases. 
      The association of granulomatous ileocolitis with coeliac disease is not common. 
      We present a case of coeliac disease with granulomatous ileocolitis with
      follow-up and repeat histology on a gluten-free diet. We discuss the pathological
      mechanisms leading to the association of granulomatous ileocolitis with coeliac
      disease as well as other conditions.

TI  - Ileal pouch anal anastomosis: an overview of surgery, recovery, and achieving
      postsurgical continence .
PG  - 22-8
AB  - Ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) is a two- or three-stage surgical procedure
      performed to treat patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) or familial adenomatous 
      polyposis (FAP). Following ileostomy closure and anastomosis, patient goals of
      care typically include obtaining continence and preventing complications. Nursing
      interventions to achieve these goals may include developing a skin care regimen, 
      pelvic muscle floor exercises (PFME), diet changes, medication use and coping
      strategies. Research suggests that patient quality of life following surgery is
      generally good, especially in patients with a functioning pouch or a history of
      severe UC and a functioning pouch. However, the procedure is relatively new, and 
      long-term (>20 years) outcomes remain largely unknown. Ongoing assessments to
      monitor complications such as pouchitis and pouch stricture are needed, as is
      research to determine the long-term effects of vaginal delivery and of living
      into the seventh, eighth, and ninth decades of life.

TI  - Higher predicted vitamin D status is associated with reduced risk of Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 482-9
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2011.11.040 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Vitamin D influences innate immunity, which is believed to be 
      involved in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).
      However, data examining vitamin D status in relation to risk of CD and UC are
      lacking. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 72,719 women (age,
      40-73 y) enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study. In 1986, women completed an
      assessment of diet and lifestyle, from which a 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D]
      prediction score was developed and validated against directly measured levels of 
      plasma 25(OH)D. Through 2008, we confirmed reported diagnoses of incident CD or
      UC through medical record review. We used Cox proportional hazards modeling to
      examine the hazard ratio (HR) for incident CD or UC after adjusting for potential
      confounders. RESULTS: During 1,492,811 person-years of follow-up evaluation, we
      documented 122 incident cases of CD and 123 cases of UC. The median predicted
      25(OH)D level was 22.3 ng/mL in the lowest and 32.2 ng/mL in the highest
      quartiles. Compared with the lowest quartile, the multivariate-adjusted HR
      associated with the highest quartile of vitamin D was 0.54 (95% confidence
      interval [CI], 0.30-.99) for CD (P(trend) = .02) and 0.65 (95% CI, 0.34-1.25) for
      UC (P(trend) = .17). Compared with women with a predicted 25(OH)D level less than
      20 ng/mL, the multivariate-adjusted HR was 0.38 (95% CI, 0.15-0.97) for CD and
      0.57 (95% CI, 0.19-1.70) for UC for women with a predicted 25(OH)D level greater 
      than 30 ng/mL. There was a significant inverse association between dietary and
      supplemental vitamin D and UC, and a nonsignificant reduction in CD risk.
      CONCLUSIONS: Higher predicted plasma levels of 25(OH)D significantly reduce the
      risk for incident CD and nonsignificantly reduce the risk for UC in women.

TI  - Carotenoid exposure of Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells did not affect selected
      inflammatory markers but altered their proteomic response.
PG  - 963-73
LID - 10.1017/S0007114511006349 [doi]
AB  - Carotenoid consumption has been linked to a number of beneficial health effects, 
      including the reduction of chronic diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular
      complications. However, no data are available on their action on the intestinal
      epithelium, being exposed to the highest concentrations of carotenoids in the
      human body, and where they could act preventively on intestinal inflammatory
      diseases such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The objective of the
      present study was to investigate whether lycopene and beta-carotene in micelles
      (M), at concentrations that could be reached via the diet (10-25 mug/ml) could
      aid in the reduction of TNF-alpha plus IL-1beta-induced inflammation of Caco-2
      human epithelial cells. The impact on biomarkers of inflammation, including IL-8,
      NO and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (through PGE-2alpha), and the NF-kappaB and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways of intracellular signalling
      cascades were evaluated compared with controls (empty M). Furthermore, proteomic 
      analyses were conducted from total cellular protein extracts. The results
      revealed that isolated carotenoids had no statistical significant
      anti-inflammatory effect on the biomarkers observed, or on the regulation of
      NF-kappaB and MAPK. Nevertheless, analyses of the proteome suggested that fifteen
      proteins were significantly (P < 0.05, expression ratio >1.3) differentially
      regulated following beta-carotene exposure, participating mostly in metabolic
      activities including antioxidant mechanisms, such as glutathione S-transferase
      A1. Only one protein was differentially regulated by lycopene (profilin-1). To
      our knowledge, this is the first attempt to investigate pathways involved in the 
      action of carotenoids on the intestinal epithelium.

TI  - Eicosanoid signalling pathways in the development and progression of colorectal
      cancer: novel approaches for prevention/intervention.
PG  - 363-85
LID - 10.1007/s10555-011-9324-x [doi]
AB  - Arachidonic acid metabolism through cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX) and 
      cytochrome P-450 epoxygenase (EPOX) pathways leads to the generation of
      biologically active eicosanoids, including prostanoids, leukotrienes,
      hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, epoxyeicosatrienoic acid and
      hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids. Eicosanoid expression levels vary during tumor
      development and progression of a range of malignancies, including colorectal
      cancer. The actions of these autocoids are also directly influenced by diet, as
      demonstrated by recent evidence for omega-3 fatty acids in colorectal cancer
      (CRC) prevention and/or treatment. Eicosanoids regulate CRC development and
      progression, while inhibition of these pathways has generally been shown to
      inhibit tumor growth/progression. A progressive sequence of colorectal cancer
      development has been identified, ranging from normal colon, to colitis,
      dysplasia, and carcinoma. While both COX and LOX inhibition are both promising
      candidates for colorectal cancer prevention and/or treatment, there is an urgent 
      need to understand the mechanisms through which these signalling pathways mediate
      their effects on tumorigenesis. This will allow identification of safer, more
      effective strategies for colorectal cancer prevention and/or treatment. In
      particular, binding to/signalling through prostanoid receptors have recently been
      the subject of considerable interest in this area. In this review, we discuss the
      role of the eicosanoid signalling pathways in the development and progression of 
      colorectal cancer. We discuss the effects of the eicosanoids on tumor cell
      proliferation, their roles in cell death induction, effects on angiogenesis,
      migration, invasion and their regulation of the immune response. Signal
      transduction pathways involved in these processes are also discussed. Finally,
      novel approaches targeting these arachidonic acid-derived eicosanoids (using
      pharmacological or natural agents) for chemoprevention and/or treatment of
      colorectal cancer are outlined.

TI  - Relevance of protein fermentation to gut health.
PG  - 184-96
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201100542 [doi]
AB  - It is generally accepted that carbohydrate fermentation results in beneficial
      effects for the host because of the generation of short chain fatty acids,
      whereas protein fermentation is considered detrimental for the host's health.
      Protein fermentation mainly occurs in the distal colon, when carbohydrates get
      depleted and results in the production of potentially toxic metabolites such as
      ammonia, amines, phenols and sulfides. However, the effectivity of these
      metabolites has been established mainly in in vitro studies. In addition, some
      important bowel diseases such as colorectal cancer (CRC) and ulcerative colitis
      appear most often in the distal colon, which is the primary site of protein
      fermentation. Finally, epidemiological studies revealed that diets rich in meat
      are associated with the prevalence of CRC, as is the case in Western society.
      Importantly, meat intake not only increases fermentation of proteins but also
      induces increased intake of fat, heme and heterocyclic amines, which may also
      play a role in the development of CRC. Despite these indications, the
      relationship between gut health and protein fermentation has not been thoroughly 
      investigated. In this review, the existing evidence about the potential toxicity 
      of protein fermentation from in vitro animal and human studies will be
      summarized.

TI  - Diet and risk of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 185-94
LID - 10.1016/j.dld.2011.10.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A better understanding of the environmental factors leading to
      inflammatory bowel disease should help to prevent occurrence of the disease and
      its relapses. AIM: To review current knowledge on dietary risk factors for
      inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: The PubMed, Medline and Cochrane Library
      were searched for studies on diet and risk of inflammatory bowel disease.
      RESULTS: Established non-diet risk factors include family predisposition,
      smoking, appendectomy, and antibiotics. Retrospective case-control studies are
      encumbered with methodological problems. Prospective studies on European cohorts,
      mainly including middle-aged adults, suggest that a diet high in protein from
      meat and fish is associated with a higher risk of inflammatory bowel disease.
      Intake of the n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid may confer risk of
      ulcerative colitis, whereas n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may be protective. No
      effect was found of intake of dietary fibres, sugar, macronutrients, total
      energy, vitamin C, D, E, Carotene, or Retinol (vitamin A) on risk of ulcerative
      colitis. No prospective data was found on risk related to intake of fruits,
      vegetables or food microparticles (titanium dioxide and aluminium silicate).
      CONCLUSIONS: A diet high in protein, particular animal protein, may be associated
      with increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease and relapses. N-6
      polyunsaturated fatty acids may predispose to ulcerative colitis whilst n-3
      polyunsaturated fatty acid may protect. These results should be confirmed in
      other countries and in younger subjects before dietary counselling is recommended
      in high risk subjects.

      clinical protocols for managing common medical problems that may impact
      breastfeeding success. These protocols serve only as guidelines for the care of
      breastfeeding mothers and infants and do not delineate an exclusive course of
      treatment or serve as standards of medical care. Variations in treatment may be
      appropriate according to the needs of an individual patient. These guidelines are
      not intended to be all-inclusive, but to provide a basic framework for physician 
      education regarding breastfeeding.

TI  - Loop ileostomy reversal after colon and rectal surgery: a single institutional
      5-year experience in 944 patients.
PG  - 1191-6
LID - 10.1001/archsurg.2011.234 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diverting loop ileostomy is used to mitigate the sequelae of
      anastomotic dehiscence. OBJECTIVE: To report the rate of complications after
      ileostomy reversal using standardized definitions to aid physicians who are
      deciding whether to divert anastomoses. METHODS: Patients who underwent diverting
      loop ileostomy closure from January 1, 2005, through February 28, 2010, were
      identified using a prospective database. Perioperative variables and 30-day
      outcomes were reviewed. Complications were graded according to the Clavien-Dindo 
      Classification, in which grade III, IV, or V represents major complications.
      Univariate analysis assessed the relationship between operative variables and
      surgical outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 944 patients underwent reversal: 43.1%
      were women, the mean age was 47.2 years, the mean body mass index (calculated as 
      weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 25.7, and 18.5% were
      American Society of Anesthesiologists class III or IV. Indications for the
      initial operation were ulcerative colitis (49.5%), rectal cancer (27.5%),
      diverticular disease (6.8%), and other (16.1%). Anastomotic technique for
      reversal was sutured fold-over in 466 patients (49.4%), stapled in 315 (33.4%),
      and handsewn end to end in 163 (17.3%). After reversal, the mean time to first
      bowel movement, tolerance of soft diet, and discharge from hospital was 2.6, 3.7,
      and 5.2 days, respectively. Handsewn cases had longer operative times and longer 
      times to bowel movement, soft diet, and discharge. Overall, complications
      occurred in 203 patients (21.5%), including 45 patients (4.8%) who experienced a 
      major complication; there were no deaths within 30 days. CONCLUSION: Ileostomy
      closure is associated with a low rate of major grade III and IV complications and
      should be reserved for patients who have a predicted postoperative major
      complication rate of 5% or more without diversion.

TI  - Relationship between endoscopic findings and clinical severity in ischemic
      colitis.
PG  - 2263-7
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: The incidence of ischemic colitis (IC) in Japan has been
      increasing due to the westernization of diet and the aging population. The aim of
      this study was to evaluate the relationship between endoscopic findings and
      clinical severity in IC. METHODS: This retrospective analysis included 106 cases 
      diagnosed with IC that were divided into two groups based on endoscopic findings 
      in the acute stage: redness and erosion (RE) versus longitudinal and
      circumferential ulcers (LCU). The clinical variables were compared between the
      two groups. In addition, we investigated the risk factors of IC associated with
      the severity of the endoscopic findings by multivariate logistic regression
      analysis. RESULTS: The percentage of cases presenting abdominal pain was
      significantly higher in the LCU group than that in the RE group (p=0.002), as
      were the baseline serum CRP levels (p=0.0001). The periods of hospitalization in 
      LCU group were longer than in the RE group (p=0.0001). Multivariate logistic
      regression analysis indicated that ischemic heart disease (IHD) and connective
      tissue disease were the independent explanatory factor associated with the
      endoscopic severity of IC (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: We showed clearly that the two
      endoscopic classifications were accurate indicators of severity and could be used
      to anticipate severity of IC. Furthermore, we confirmed that IHD and connective
      tissue disease were the exacerbating factor associated with the severity of
      endoscopic findings in IC.

TI  - Induction of dsRNA-activated protein kinase links mitochondrial unfolded protein 
      response to the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation.
PG  - 1269-1278
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2011-300767 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) feature multiple cellular stress
      responses, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) unfolded protein responses
      (UPRs). UPRs represent autoregulatory pathways that adjust organelle capacity to 
      cellular demand. A similar mechanism, mitochondrial UPR (mtUPR), has been
      described for mitochondria. ER UPR in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs)
      contributes to the development of intestinal inflammation, and since
      mitochondrial alterations and dysfunction are implicated in the pathogenesis of
      IBDs, the authors characterised mtUPR in the context of intestinal inflammation. 
      METHODS: Truncated ornithine transcarbamylase was used to selectively induce
      mtUPR in a murine IEC line. Dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) was administered to PKR
      (double-stranded-RNA-activated protein kinase) knockout mice to induce IEC stress
      in vivo and to test for their susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis. Expression
      levels of the mitochondrial chaperone chaperonin 60 (CPN60) and PKR were
      quantified in IECs from patients with IBDs and from murine models of colitis
      using immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Selective mtUPR
      induction by truncated ornithine transcarbamylase transfection triggered the
      phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 2alpha and cJun
      through the recruitment of PKR. Using pharmacological inhibitors and small
      inhibitory RNA, the authors identified mtUPR-induced eIF2alpha phosphorylation
      and transcription factor activation (cJun/AP1) as being dependent on the
      activities of the mitochondrial protease ClpP and the cytoplasmic kinase PKR.
      Pkr(-/-) mice failed to induce CPN60 in IECs upon DSS treatment at early time
      points and subsequently showed an almost complete resistance to DSS-induced
      colitis. Under inflammatory conditions, primary IECs from patients with IBDs and 
      two murine models of colitis exhibited a strong induction of the mtUPR marker
      protein CPN60 associated with enhanced expression of PKR. CONCLUSION: PKR
      integrates mtUPR into the disease-relevant ER UPR via eIF2alpha phosphorylation
      and AP1 activation. Induction of mtUPR and PKR was observed in IECs from murine
      models and patients with IBDs. The authors' results indicate that PKR might link 
      mitochondrial stress to intestinal inflammation.

TI  - Early experience with single-site laparoscopic surgery for complicated ileocolic 
      Crohn's disease at a tertiary-referral center.
PG  - 777-82
LID - 10.1007/s00464-011-1951-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of single-site laparoscopy (SSL) for the treatment of
      ileocolic Crohn's disease complicated by an abscess, a phlegmon, or fistulizing
      disease has not been thoroughly assessed. METHODS: A prospectively maintained
      database of SSL surgeries performed between October 2010 and March 2011 was
      reviewed. Consecutive patients with ileocolic Crohn's disease complicated by a
      paracolic abscess, a phlegmon, or a fistula were included for analysis. Data
      recorded included demographic information, body mass index (BMI), estimated blood
      loss (EBL), length of surgery, rate of conversion to standard laparoscopic
      surgery or open surgery, length of hospital stay, and rate of complications.
      RESULTS: A total of six patients were identified. Complications from Crohn's
      disease included four (66%) patients who developed a paracolic abscess that
      required drainage upon admission, one (16%) patient who developed a phlegmon, and
      one (16%) patient who developed an enterocutaneous fistula. Mean age of the study
      population was 25 years, with a mean BMI of 21 and a mean ASA score of 3. Five
      (83%) of the patients were immunosuppressed with high-dose steroids. Mean
      operative time was 160 min, with a median EBL of 60 mL. One patient required the 
      insertion of an additional trocar, whereas there were no conversions to
      laparotomy. Four (66%) patients required diversion with a loop ileostomy. Median 
      time to flatus was 1 day. All patients tolerated a diet on the day of surgery,
      with a median length of stay of 3 days. There were no deaths and no complications
      related to bleeding, organ injury, surgical site infections, or anastomotic
      leaks. CONCLUSIONS: A single-site laparoscopic approach for complicated ileocolic
      Crohn's disease can be performed safely, with short lengths of hospital stay and 
      with a low rate of complications. A multicenter study would be beneficial to
      validate these findings.

TI  - Black tea extract prevents lipopolysaccharide-induced NF-kappaB signaling and
      attenuates dextran sulfate sodium-induced experimental colitis.
PG  - 91
LID - 10.1186/1472-6882-11-91 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Black tea has been shown to elicit anti-oxidant, anti-carcinogenic,
      anti-inflammatory and anti-mutagenic properties. In this study, we investigated
      the impact of black tea extract (BTE) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced
      NF-kappaB signaling in bone marrow derived-macrophages (BMM) and determined the
      therapeutic efficacy of this extract on colon inflammation. METHODS: The effect
      of BTE on LPS-induced NF-kappaB signaling and pro-inflammatory gene expression
      was evaluated by RT-PCR, Western blotting, immunofluorescence and electrophoretic
      mobility shift assay (EMSA). The in vivo efficacy of BTE was assessed in mice
      with 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. The severity of colitis was
      measured by weight loss, colon length and histologic scores. RESULTS: LPS-induced
      IL-12p40, IL-23p19, IL-6 and IL-1beta mRNA expressions were inhibited by BTE.
      LPS-induced IkappaBalpha phosphorylation/degradation and nuclear translocation of
      NF-kappaB/p65 were blocked by BTE. BTE treatment blocked LPS-induced DNA-binding 
      activity of NF-kappaB. BTE-fed, DSS-exposed mice showed the less weight loss,
      longer colon length and lower histologic score compared to control diet-fed,
      DSS-exposed mice. DSS-induced IkappaBalpha phosphorylation/degradation and
      phosphorylation of NF-kappaB/p65 were blocked by BTE. An increase of cleaved
      caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in DSS-exposed mice was blocked
      by BTE. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that BTE attenuates colon
      inflammation through the blockage of NF-kappaB signaling and apoptosis in
      DSS-induced experimental colitis model.

TI  - Single-incision laparoscopic total abdominal colectomy for refractory ulcerative 
      colitis.
PG  - 862-8

AB  - BACKGROUND: A three-stage restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal
      anastomosis is the treatment of choice for the particularly debilitated patient
      with medically refractory ulcerative colitis (UC). Laparoscopic surgery has been 
      shown to offer several advantages over the open approach in this setting.
      Single-incision laparoscopic surgery is an emerging minimally invasive strategy
      representing a truly scarless procedure for the first surgical step, namely, the 
      total abdominal colectomy (TAC). METHODS: Nine consecutive patients with
      medically refractory UC underwent a single-incision laparoscopic TAC between May 
      and October 2010. All patients were on aggressive medical therapy with
      corticosteroids or immunosuppressors and were selected for this approach on the
      basis of their body habitus and the absence of relevant comorbidities. The whole 
      operation was performed through a single access to the abdominal cavity, placed
      at the ostomy site marked preoperatively. RESULTS: Mean operating time was 142
      +/- 23 min, with an estimate blood loss of 108 +/- 125 ml. No intraoperative
      complications or conversions to conventional laparoscopy or open surgery
      occurred. In all cases the postoperative course was uneventful. The return of
      bowel function was observed on postoperative day 1.7 +/- 0.7, and patients could 
      tolerate a solid diet on postoperative day 3 +/- 0.5. The mean postoperative
      length of stay was 5.2 +/- 1.3 days. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, a
      single-incision laparoscopic approach to total abdominal colectomy for refractory
      ulcerative colitis has been shown to be safe and feasible. Initial results
      suggest that this technique can lead to improvements in short-term outcomes in
      selected patients.

TI  - The role of nutrition in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 248-53
LID - 10.1016/j.cppeds.2011.04.005 [doi]
AB  - Many foods have been implicated in theories about the etiology of inflammatory
      bowel disease. While evidence has accumulated that nutritional factors as part of
      overall lifestyle changes may play a role in the growing incidence, no specific
      dietary recommendations except the promotion of breastfeeding can currently be
      given to decrease the risk of developing Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.
      For the treatment of Crohn's disease in children and adolescents, however,
      enteral feeding with a semi-elemental diet seems to be as effective as
      corticosteroids in inducing and maintaining remission. In the meta-analyses,
      advantages of one formula over the other are evened out, and more research is
      warranted into the anti-inflammatory properties of different nutrients, such as
      polyunsaturated fatty acids, butyrate, glutamine, and cytokines, such as
      transforming growth factors-beta. Unfortunately, for practical reasons,
      nutritional therapy remains underutilized, even though pediatric patients are
      most vulnerable to the harmful effects of nutrient deficiencies on growth,
      pubertal development, and bone health. There is hope that in the future the new
      field of nutrigenomics may enable physicians to more accurately tailor a specific
      diet to the patient genotype.

TI  - Clinical presentation and risk factors of inflammatory bowel disease in Sri
      Lanka.
PG  - 31-5
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There have been very few studies on inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) in Sri Lanka. This study was undertaken to determine the clinical
      presentation and whether a western style diet or infection with geo-helminths
      were associated with the condition. METHODS: Three questionnaires were given to
      the patients: one relating to diet, one relating to clinical presentation and one
      relating to quality of life. The disease was confirmed endoscopically and
      histologically. Faeces were examined for parasites. RESULTS: Forty four patients 
      were enrolled (43-ulcerative colitis; 1-Crohn's Disease). All but one had
      ulcerative colitis. Most had no family history of disease. The peak age of onset 
      was 21-40 y and 63% gave a history of more than 6 months symptoms prior to
      diagnosis. Clinical presentation was similar to cases in western countries
      although milder with less severe life-events. None of them had undergone surgery.
      All patients ate a rice-based diet and none ate bread made of refined flour. Only
      2 patient was infected with a geo-helminth. CONCLUSIONS: Eating bread made of
      refined flour is not related to development of IBD in these patients. The
      prevalence of geo-helminths in the study population corresponded to the general
      population average. Delay in diagnosis occurs because of an initial assumption
      that the cause of symptoms is infective. A National Register of non-infectious
      gastrointestinal disease would aid the epidemiology and allocation of funding to 
      this inflammatory condition.

TI  - Total abdominal colectomy for refractory ulcerative colitis. Surgical treatment
      in evolution.
PG  - 1909-16
LID - 10.1007/s11605-011-1666-8 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Total abdominal colectomy is the procedure of choice for
      debilitated patients with acute, medical refractory ulcerative colitis in our
      practice. A laparoscopic approach has been previously shown to be safe and
      effective, and has become our preferred strategy. This study illustrates the
      laparoscopic evolution towards a truly minimally invasive approach comparing
      three phases of a single colorectal surgeon experience. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 
      May 2010 single incision laparoscopy was introduced in our practice and has
      become our preferred approach. Ten consecutive ulcerative colitis patients were
      case matched and compared with 10 previous laparoscopic-assisted (Feb 2003-Jan
      2007) and 10 hand-assisted (Feb 2006-Apr 2010) total abdominal colectomies.
      Patient, disease and surgery-related factors were analyzed and short-term
      outcomes were compared. RESULTS: Given the study design, there were no
      differences in demographics, smoking history, disease duration and severity,
      nutritional and inflammatory parameters, and indication for surgery between
      groups. Single incision patients were more likely to have received
      immunosuppressive therapy within 30 days of the surgery (p = 0.016). In the
      single incision group we noticed significantly shorter duration of surgery (p <
      0.001) and faster resumption of solid diet (p = 0.019) compared to the other
      groups. Other short-term outcomes did not differ between groups. CONCLUSION:
      Single incision laparoscopy offers a safe alternative to other laparoscopic
      approaches. Despite the higher technical complexity, the duration of surgery is
      shorter with faster resumption of oral intake. Studies with larger sample size
      and longer follow-up will be required to confirm the benefits of this approach.

TI  - Anti-inflammatory properties of dairy lactobacilli.
PG  - 657-66
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21834 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The intestinal microbiota plays an important role in human health
      through the modulation of innate immune responses. While selected commensal
      bacteria are marketed in specific probiotic products to control these responses, 
      relatively little is known about the immune modulation potential of dairy
      bacteria that have principally been selected for their fermentation properties.
      The modulation of innate immune responses may reduce chronic inflammation in
      inflammatory bowel diseases like ulcerative colitis. METHODS: A collection of
      dairy Lactobacillus delbrueckii strains was screened for immune modulation
      effects in vitro through the quantification of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB)
      activation in a human intestinal epithelial cell line. Selected bacterial strains
      were then tested in vivo in a mouse dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) colitis model.
      RESULTS: All L. delbrueckii strains tested showed anti-inflammatory effects in
      vitro, to an extent that varied between strains. These effects rely on bacterial 
      surface exposed proteins and affect the central part of the NF-kappaB activation 
      pathway. One of the selected strains significantly reduced the macroscopic and
      microscopic symptoms of DSS-induced colitis in the mouse intestinal tract,
      diminished body weight loss, and improved survival. CONCLUSIONS: The results of
      this study show that dairy lactobacilli that often are part of a regular diet can
      modulate innate immune responses, and may thus affect health more than generally 
      thought. One of the strains tested alleviated the symptoms of DSS-induced colitis
      in mice, a model of human ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Treatment of colitis with a commensal gut bacterium engineered to secrete human
      TGF-beta1 under the control of dietary xylan 1.
PG  - 1925-35
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21565 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: While cytokine therapy and the use of immunosuppressive cytokines
      such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) offer great potential for the 
      treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), issues concerning formulation,
      stability in vivo, delivery to target tissues, and potential toxicity need to be 
      addressed. In consideration of these problems we engineered the human commensal
      bacterium Bacteroides ovatus for the controlled in situ delivery of TGF-beta(1)
      and treatment of colitis. METHODS: Sequence encoding the human tgf-beta1 gene was
      cloned downstream of the xylanase promoter in the xylan operon of B. ovatus by
      homologous recombination. Resulting recombinants (BO-TGF) were tested for
      TGF-beta production in the presence and absence of polysaccharide xylan in vitro 
      and in vivo, and used to treat experimental murine colitis. Clinical and
      pathological scores were used to assess the effectiveness of therapy. Colonic
      inflammatory markers including inflammatory cytokine expression were assessed by 
      colorimetric assay and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: BO-TGF
      secreted high levels of biologically active dimeric TGF-beta in vitro and in vivo
      in a xylan-controlled manner. Administration of xylan in drinking water to
      BO-TGF-treated mice resulted in a significant clinical improvement of colitis,
      accelerating healing of damaged colonic epithelium, reducing inflammatory cell
      infiltration, reducing expression of proinflammatory cytokines, and promoting
      production of mucin-rich goblet cells in colonic crypts. These beneficial effects
      are comparable and in most cases superior to that achieved by conventional
      steroid therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This novel drug delivery system has potential for
      the targeted and controlled delivery of TGF-beta(1) and other immunotherapeutic
      agents for the long-term management of various bowel disorders.

AB  - The diet of industrialized nations may contribute to the pathogenesis of both
      ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD). Malnutrition is relatively
      unusual in UC, but in CD, which often affects the small intestine, it is frequent
      and may be severe. Nutrition support is therefore frequently indicated. First
      principles of artificial nutrition can be applied effectively using the gut
      whenever possible. Parenteral nutrition is generally required only in those with 
      short bowel syndrome. An increasing literature (especially in pediatrics) favors 
      the use of defined exclusive enteral nutrition (EN) in the primary treatment of
      active CD. Controlled trials are, however, lacking, and recommendations are
      accordingly not of the highest rank. It appears that in this context, simple
      polymeric regimens are usually sufficient, and there is currently insufficient
      evidence to make a strong recommendation for disease-specific feeds. In the
      maintenance of remission in CD, controlled data demonstrate that defined EN
      reduces the risk of relapse requiring steroid treatment. There are no data in
      support of primary nutrition therapy in UC either in management of the acute
      flare or in maintenance. In conclusion, nutrition therapy in adults with
      inflammatory bowel disease is probably both undervalued and underused, but the
      evidence base needs to be strengthened to confirm its efficacy, determine better 
      those patients most likely to benefit, and optimize the regimens to be employed.

TI  - Anti-inflammatory effects of nicotine in obesity and ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 129
LID - 10.1186/1479-5876-9-129 [doi]
AB  - Cigarette smoke is a major risk factor for a number of diseases including lung
      cancer and respiratory infections. Paradoxically, it also contains nicotine, an
      anti-inflammatory alkaloid. There is increasing evidence that smokers have a
      lower incidence of some inflammatory diseases, including ulcerative colitis, and 
      the protective effect involves the activation of a cholinergic anti-inflammatory 
      pathway that requires the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7nAChR)
      on immune cells. Obesity is characterized by chronic low-grade inflammation,
      which contributes to insulin resistance. Nicotine significantly improves glucose 
      homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in genetically obese and diet-induced obese
      mice, which is associated with suppressed adipose tissue inflammation.
      Inflammation that results in disruption of the epithelial barrier is a hallmark
      of inflammatory bowel disease, and nicotine is protective in ulcerative colitis. 
      This article summarizes current evidence for the anti-inflammatory effects of
      nicotine in obesity and ulcerative colitis. Selective agonists for the
      alpha7nAChR could represent a promising pharmacological strategy for the
      treatment of inflammation in obesity and ulcerative colitis. Nevertheless, we
      should keep in mind that the anti-inflammatory effects of nicotine could be
      mediated via the expression of several nAChRs on a particular target cell.

      colitis.
PG  - 1441-53
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201100139 [doi]
AB  - In inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), it is known that besides genetic and
      environmental factors (e.g. diet, drugs, stress), the microbiota play an
      important role in the pathogenesis. Patients with IBD have an altered microbiota 
      (dysbiosis) and therefore, probiotics, defined as 'live micro-organisms that when
      administered in adequate amounts can confer a health benefit on the host', have
      been suggested as nutritional supplements to restore these imbalances. The best
      response on probiotics among the different types of IBD appears to be in the case
      of ulcerative colitis. Although probiotics show promise in IBD in both clinical
      and animal studies, further mechanistic studies are necessary to optimize the use
      of probiotics as supporting therapy in IBD. Murine models of experimental colitis
      have been used for decades to study this pathology, and these models have been
      proven useful to search for new therapeutic approaches. The purpose of this
      review is to summarize probiotic-host interaction studies in murine models of
      experimental colitis and to evaluate how these models can further help in
      understanding these complex interactions. Unraveling the molecular mechanisms
      behind the beneficial effects will assist in better and possibly more efficient
      probiotic formulations.

TI  - Serum concentrations of VEGF and TGF-beta1 during exclusive enteral nutrition in 
      IBD.
PG  - 150-5
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3182144c74 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is an effective method of
      treatment in achieving remission in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however,
      its mechanism of action is still poorly understood. The objective of our study
      was to assess the influence of EEN on serum vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1) in children and
      adolescents with IBD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine children and adolescents 
      with IBD (24 with Crohn disease [CD] and 15 with ulcerative colitis [UC]) and 25 
      healthy controls were enrolled in the study. VEGF and TGF-beta1 were assessed at 
      the baseline and after 2 and 4 weeks of EEN in CD and UC groups and once in
      controls using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay immunoassays. RESULTS: At the
      baseline, we found increased serum VEGF in the CD versus UC group and controls (P
      < 0.05) and serum TGF-beta1 in the UC versus CD group and controls (P < 0.05).
      During EEN, VEGF decreased in the UC and CD groups, whereas TGF-beta1 increased
      in the CD group and decreased in the UC group. The CD group achieved disease
      remission faster than the UC group, and the weight gain of patients with CD
      during EEN was higher compared with patients with UC. Additionally, TGF-beta1
      concentration correlated with protein and energies daily intake in the CD group
      (R = 0.95; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Different effectiveness of EEN in achieving
      remission in CD and UC may result from a modification of growth factor
      production. EEN stimulated TGF-beta1 production in CD but not in UC, which
      possibly resulted in higher effectiveness of EEN in this group of patients.

TI  - Allergic proctocolitis refractory to maternal hypoallergenic diet in exclusively 
      breast-fed infants: a clinical observation.
PG  - 82
LID - 10.1186/1471-230X-11-82 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Allergic proctocolitis (APC) in exclusively breast-fed infants is
      caused by food proteins, deriving from maternal diet, transferred through
      lactation. In most cases a maternal cow milk-free diet leads to a prompt
      resolution of rectal bleeding, while in some patients a multiple food allergy can
      occur. The aim of this study was to assess whether the atopy patch test (APT)
      could be helpful to identify this subgroup of patients requiring to discontinue
      breast-feeding due to polisensitization. Additionally, we assessed the efficacy
      of an amino acid-based formula (AAF) when multiple food allergy is suspected.
      amino acid-based formula METHODS: We have prospectively enrolled 14 exclusively
      breast-fed infants with APC refractory to maternal allergen avoidance. The
      diagnosis was confirmed by endoscopy with biopsies. Skin prick tests and serum
      specific IgE for common foods, together with APTs for common foods plus breast
      milk, were performed. After a 1 month therapy of an AAF all patients underwent a 
      follow-up rectosigmoidoscopy. RESULTS: Prick tests and serum specific IgE were
      negative. APTs were positive in 100% infants, with a multiple positivity in 50%. 
      Sensitization was found for breast milk in 100%, cow's milk (50%), soy (28%), egg
      (21%), rice (14%), wheat (7%). Follow-up rectosigmoidoscopy confirmed the
      remission of APC in all infants. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that APT might
      become a useful tool to identify subgroups of infants with multiple
      gastrointestinal food allergy involving a delayed immunogenic mechanism, with the
      aim to avoid unnecessary maternal dietary restrictions before discontinuing
      breast-feeding.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Restorative proctocolectomy with ileoanal pouch is the definitive
      procedure in ulcerative colitis. The potential benefits afforded by a single
      incision laparoscopic (SILS) approach make it appropriate to consider. METHODS:
      Electronic data were prospectively collected from all patients who underwent SILS
      restorative proctocolectomy (SILS-RPC) between June 2009 and June 2010. RESULTS: 
      Ten consecutive patients (4 male), with median BMI = 22 (range = 20-28 kg/m(2))
      underwent SILS-LRPC over a 1-year period. Three had undergone a previous
      emergency laparoscopic colectomy. A single-port device (Covidien SILS or Olympus 
      TriPort) was positioned at the site of the existing or proposed temporary
      ileostomy (2.5-cm incision). The colon and rectum were extracted through the SILS
      site (n = 8) or transanally following a mucosectomy (n = 2). A 20-cm J pouch was 
      constructed extracorporeally and returned via the ileostomy site. Pouch-anal
      anastomosis was performed intracorporeally (n = 8) or hand-sutured (n = 2) and a 
      diverting loop ileostomy was created at the SILS port site. The median operation 
      time was 185 min (range = 100-381). There were no conversions or additional ports
      required. Median time to full diet was 36 h (range = 4-48 h) with a median
      hospital stay of 3 days (range = 2-8 days). There were no 30-day readmissions.
      Complications included surgical emphysema with temperature and a panic attack.
      Nine stomas have been closed. All patients have spontaneity of defecation, with a
      median pouch frequency of four per day, including once at night. All are fully
      continent and able to defer during the day. One reported a dry ejaculate for 10
      weeks. CONCLUSION: SILS restorative proctocolectomy is safe with good early
      functional outcomes when performed by an experienced laparoscopic surgeon.

AB  - The human gastrointestinal tract harbors a complex and abundant microbial
      community reaching as high as 10(13)-10(14) microorganisms in the colon. This
      endogenous microbiota forms a symbiotic relationship with their eukaryotic host
      and this close partnership helps maintain homeostasis by performing essential and
      non-redundant tasks (e.g. nutrition/energy and, immune system balance, pathogen
      exclusion). Although this relationship is essential and beneficial to the host,
      various events (e.g. infection, diet, stress, inflammation) may impact microbial 
      composition, leading to the formation of a dysbiotic microbiota, further
      impacting on health and disease states. For example, Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis, collectively termed inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), have
      been associated with the establishment of a dysbiotic microbiota. In addition,
      extra-intestinal disorders such as obesity and metabolic syndrome are also
      associated with the development of a dysbiotic microbiota. Consequently, there is
      an increasing interest in harnessing the power of the microbiome and modulating
      its composition as a means to alleviate intestinal pathologies/disorders and
      maintain health status. In this review, we will discuss the emerging relationship
      between the microbiota and development of colorectal cancer as well as present
      evidence that microbial manipulation (probiotic, prebiotic) impacts disease
      development.

AB  - During the last few years a significant advance has been achieved in the
      understanding of the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). From twin 
      studies it was evident that there is more that 50% concordance of Crohn's disease
      (CD) in monozygotic twin pairs, however it is only 3.6% among dizygotic twins.
      These data indicate that the genetic background may be responsible for 50% of the
      risk or 'susceptibility' to develop CD. Obviously it is not a sufficient
      condition as otherwise there would be 100% concordance of disease in monozygotic 
      twin pairs. Environmental factors as well must play an important role. This is
      further supported by the fact that there is only low development in genetic risk 
      factors over ten thousands of years. In contrast, the incidence of CD and
      ulcerative colitis (UC) has dramatically increased in Western countries in the
      last 100 years. This further supports the concept of a 'Western lifestyle
      factor(s)' that triggers chronic intestinal inflammation in a genetically
      susceptible host. The proof of the concept of a genetic susceptibility was
      achieved in 2001 with the discovery that NOD2 is the most important
      susceptibility gene for CD. The function of NOD2 has been investigated in detail.
      NOD2 is an intracellular 'alarm button', a receptor recognizing invading bacteria
      that entered the mucosal wall. NOD2 mutants associated with susceptibility to CD 
      seem to be deficient in their recognition of bacterial wall products. In a
      genome-wide association study a disease association was found in the
      autophagy-related 16-like 1 gene (ATG16L1). The ATG16L1 gene encodes a protein in
      the autophagosome pathway that processes intracellular bacteria. Based on these
      findings, CD is now discussed as an impaired and inadequate immune reaction to
      the gut bacteria which are a part of our environment (or perhaps 'in-vironment').
      In addition to NOD2 and ATG16L1, there are more 'innate' pathways by which
      commensal and pathogenic bacteria can directly interact with cells of the
      intestinal mucosa. The 'environment concept' and the 'genetic concept' of IBD
      pathophysiology are converging. With the finding that most susceptibility genes
      for CD and UC are involved in innate immune mechanisms and the primary defense
      against bacteria entering the mucosa, for the first time a unifying concept of
      the 'genetic pathophysiology hypothesis' and the 'environment pathophysiology
      hypothesis' of IBD was possible. Bacteria are the link between the environment
      and mucosal defense system.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Paediatric onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may cause
      alterations in energy requirements and invalidate the use of standard prediction 
      equations. Our aim was to evaluate four commonly used prediction equations for
      resting energy expenditure (REE) in children with IBD. METHODS: Sixty-three
      children had repeated measurements of REE as part of a longitudinal research
      study yielding a total of 243 measurements. These were compared with predicted
      REE from Schofield, Oxford, FAO/WHO/UNU, and Harris-Benedict equations using the 
      Bland-Altman method. RESULTS: Mean (+/-SD) age of the patients was 14.2 (2.4)
      years. Mean measured REE was 1566 (336) kcal per day compared with 1491 (236),
      1441 (255), 1481 (232), and 1435 (212) kcal per day calculated from Schofield,
      Oxford, FAO/WHO/UNU, and Harris-Benedict, respectively. While the Schofield
      equation demonstrated the least difference between measured and predicted REE,
      it, along with the other equations tested, did not perform uniformly across all
      subjects, indicating greater errors at either end of the spectrum of energy
      expenditure. Smaller differences were found for all prediction equations for
      Crohn's disease compared with ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Of the commonly
      used equations, the equation of Schofield should be used in pediatric patients
      with IBD when measured values are not able to be obtained.

      diet-promoted murine colon cancer: role of G1 regulators.
PG  - 960-75
LID - 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-10-0531 [doi]
AB  - Epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) contribute to colonic tumorigenesis in
      experimental models of colon cancer. We previously showed that EGFR was also
      required for colonic tumor promotion by Western diet. The goal of this study was 
      to identify EGFR-regulated microRNAs that contribute to diet-promoted colonic
      tumorigenesis. Murine colonic tumors from Egfr(wt) and hypomorphic Egfr(wa2) mice
      were screened using micro RNA (miRNA) arrays and miR-143 and miR-145 changes
      confirmed by Northern, real-time PCR, and in situ analysis. Rodent and human
      sporadic and ulcerative colitis (UC)-associated colon cancers were examined for
      miR-143 and miR-145. Effects of EGFR on miR-143 and miR-145 expression were
      assessed in murine and human colonic cells and their putative targets examined in
      vitro and in vivo. miR-143 and miR-145 were readily detected in normal
      colonocytes and comparable in Egfr(wt) and Egfr(wa2) mice. These miRNAs were
      downregulated in azoxymethane and inflammation-associated colonic tumors from
      Egfr(wt) mice but upregulated in Egfr(wa2) tumors. They were also reduced in
      human sporadic and UC colon cancers. EGFR signals suppressed miR-143 and miR-145 
      in human and murine colonic cells. Transfected miR-143 and miR-145 inhibited
      HCT116 cell growth in vitro and in vivo and downregulated G(1) regulators, K-Ras,
      MYC, CCND2, cdk6, and E2F3, putative or established targets of these miRNAs.
      miRNA targets Ras and MYC were increased in colonic tumors from Egfr(wt) but not 
      Egfr(wa2) mice fed a Western diet. EGFR suppresses miR-143 and miR-145 in murine 
      models of colon cancer. Furthermore, Western diet unmasks the tumor suppressor
      roles of these EGFR-regulated miRNAs.

AB  - Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) often question their doctors about
      diet. The objectives of this article are to provide clinicians with existing
      dietary advice by presenting the dietary information proposed by medical
      societies in the form of clinical practice guidelines as it relates to IBD;
      listing dietary guidelines from patient-centered IBD-related organizations; and
      creating a new 'global practice guideline' that attempts to consolidate the
      existing information regarding diet and IBD. The dietary suggestions derived from
      sources found in this article include nutritional deficiency screening, avoiding 
      foods that worsen symptoms, eating smaller meals at more frequent intervals,
      drinking adequate fluids, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, taking vitamin/mineral
      supplementation, eliminating dairy if lactose intolerant, limiting excess fat,
      reducing carbohydrates and reducing high-fiber foods during flares. Mixed advice 
      exists regarding probiotics. Enteral nutrition is recommended for Crohn's disease
      patients in Japan, which differs from practices in the USA.

      fatty acids in intestinal microvascular endothelium.
PG  - 678-87
LID - 10.1016/j.clnu.2011.05.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The role of endothelial cells in inflammatory bowel disease
      has been recently emphasized. Endothelial activation and expression of adhesion
      molecules are critical for leukocytes recruitment into the inflammatory wall.
      Compelling evidence demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects of long chain n-3 PUFA
      in inflammatory models. We previously showed that long chain n-3 PUFA (EPA and
      DHA) inhibited inflammatory response in epithelial and dendritic cells. As long
      chain n-3 PUFA treatment led to a decreased expression of adhesion molecules in
      endothelial cells from other organs, we have now investigated their effect on
      intestinal endothelial cells in vitro and in colitic rats. METHODS: In vitro
      study: Primary culture of human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells
      (HIMEC) were pre-treated with DHA and then incubated with IL-1beta. In vivo
      study: Colitis was induced in 2 groups at day0 by intrarectal injection of
      2-4-6-trinitrobenzen sulfonic acid (TNBS). Rats received by gavage either fish
      oil, rich in EPA and DHA (TNBS+n-3) or an isocaloric isolipidic oil formula for
      14 days. RESULTS: DHA led to a decreased VCAM-1, TLR4, cyclooxygenase-2 and
      VEGFR2 expression and a decreased production of IL-6, IL-8 and GM-CSF and a
      reduced production of PGE(2) and LTB(4) (p < 0.001) in IL-1beta-induced HIMEC.
      Similarly, dietary intervention with fish oil rich in EPA and DHA significantly
      decreased colon production of PGE(2) and LTB(4,) endothelial VCAM-1 and VEGFR2 in
      rats with colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Data obtained from in vitro and in vivo studies
      reveal a potential anti-angiogenic role of long chain n-3 PUFA in intestinal
      endothelial cells. This protective effect of long chain n-3 PUFA may partly
      explain the observed benefit of dietary intake of long chain n-3 PUFA in IBD
      development.

AB  - Numerous complications can occur in celiac disease, nutritional (growth failure
      in children, malnutrition, vitamin deficiencies), hematologic (anaemia), bone
      disease (osteoporosis, fracture), gynaecologic (hypo fertility), cardiovascular
      (coronaropathy, venous thrombosis), neurological (peripheral neuropathy), hepatic
      (cytolysis, cirrhosis). Celiac disease is associated with an increased risk of
      autoimmune diseases (type 1 diabetes, thyroiditis), and cancer (upper digestive
      tract, hepatocellular carcinoma, lymphoma). The main digestive complications are 
      microscopic colitis and refractory sprue, which are resistant to gluten-free
      diet. It can be associated with a monoclonal proliferation of intraepithelial
      lymphocytes (type 2 refractory sprue), which may be considered as a cryptic
      lymphoma and can lead to invasive T lymphoma, which occurs in one celiac patient 
      in 1000. Gluten-free diet protects from the occurrence of most complications and 
      correct the over-mortality related to these complications.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To highlight recent evidence supporting a concept that
      intestinal inflammation is a mediator or contributor to development of obesity
      and insulin resistance. RECENT FINDINGS: Current views suggest that
      obesity-associated systemic and adipose tissue inflammation promote insulin
      resistance, which underlies many obesity-linked health risks. Diet-induced
      changes in gut microbiota also contribute to obesity. Recent findings support a
      concept that high-fat diet and bacteria interact to promote early inflammatory
      changes in the small intestine that contribute to development of or
      susceptibility to obesity and insulin resistance. This review summarizes the
      evidence supporting a role of intestinal inflammation in diet-induced obesity and
      insulin resistance and discusses mechanisms. SUMMARY: The role of diet-induced
      intestinal inflammation as an early biomarker and mediator of obesity, and
      insulin resistance warrants further study.

TI  - Celiac disease and microscopic colitis: a report of 4 cases.
PG  - 2150-4
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v17.i16.2150 [doi]
AB  - Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder of the small intestine that occurs 
      in genetically predisposed people at all ages. However, it can be associated also
      to other immunopathological disorders, and may be associated with abnormal
      histology in segments of the gut other than the small bowel including colonic
      inflammation. While guidelines for endoscopic investigation of the jejunum are
      well defined, no indication is defined for colonic investigation. We describe
      four cases of concurrent CD and microscopic colitis (MC) diagnosed at our
      department over a 10-year period and analyzed the main features and outcomes of
      CD in this setting. The symptoms of these patients were improved initially by a
      gluten-free diet before the onset of MC symptoms. Two of the patients were
      siblings and had an atypical form of CD. The other two patients with CD and MC
      also presented with fibrosing alveolitis and were anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae
      antibody positive. The co-existence of immune-mediated small bowel and colonic
      inflammatory and pulmonary diseases are not well-known, and no systematic
      approach has been used to identify the lifelong patterns of these immune-based
      diseases. Patients can develop, or present with CD at any stage in life, which
      can co-exist with other gastrointestinal diseases of (auto-) immune origin. In
      addition, the familial co-existence and prevalence of MC in patients with a prior
      diagnosis of CD are unclear. Clinicians managing celiac disease should be aware
      of these associations and understand when to consider colon investigation.

TI  - Modified apple polysaccharide prevents against tumorigenesis in a mouse model of 
      colitis-associated colon cancer: role of galectin-3 and apoptosis in cancer
      prevention.
PG  - 107-17
LID - 10.1007/s00394-011-0194-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common and preventable
      cancers. Regular consumption of apples is conducive to reduction in CRC risk. AIM
      OF THE STUDY: To evaluate effects of modified apple polysaccharide (MAP) on
      tumorigenesis in a mouse model of colitis-associated colon cancer. METHODS: One
      hundred male ICR mice were administered with 1, 2-dimethyl-hydrazine (DMH) and
      dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Forty mice were given no further treatment, the
      rest were fed basal diet blended with three different doses of MAP; 2.5, 5, and
      10% (20 mice in each group). RESULTS: MAP significantly protected ICR mice
      against DMH/DSS-induced tumorigenesis. The incidence of tumor development was 90%
      (18/20) in the mice treated with DMH/DSS, but that was reduced to 25% (5/20), 15%
      (3/20), and 5% (1/20), respectively, in the mice treated with basal diets plus
      2.5, 5, and 10% of MAP. Study of apoptosis of colonic epithelial cells revealed
      that MAP moderately increased apoptosis, suggesting that the anti-tumor potency
      of MAP was probably attributed to its ability to induce apoptosis. Western blot
      analysis demonstrated that carbohydrate-binding protein galectin-3 changed in
      both the nucleus and the cytoplasm during the process from colitis to colon
      cancer in the model. And MAP could inhibit the binding of galectin-3 to its
      ligand: this is, at least in part, the possible mechanism of MAP by enhancing
      apoptosis and preventing tumorigenesis. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that MAP 
      has a potential role in clinical prevention and treatment for colon cancer.

TI  - Dietary intake and risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic
      review of the literature.
PG  - 563-73
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2011.44 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasing.
      Dietary factors such as the spread of the "Western" diet, high in fat and protein
      but low in fruits and vegetables, may be associated with the increase. Although
      many studies have evaluated the association between diet and IBD risk, there has 
      been no systematic review. METHODS: We performed a systematic review using
      guideline-recommended methodology to evaluate the association between pre-illness
      intake of nutrients (fats, carbohydrates, protein) and food groups (fruits,
      vegetables, meats) and the risk of subsequent IBD diagnosis. Eligible studies
      were identified via structured keyword searches in PubMed and Google Scholar and 
      manual searches. RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included, encompassing 2,609 IBD 
      patients (1,269 Crohn's disease (CD) and 1,340 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients) 
      and over 4,000 controls. Studies reported a positive association between high
      intake of saturated fats, monounsaturated fatty acids, total polyunsaturated
      fatty acids (PUFAs), total omega-3 fatty acids, omega-6 fatty acids, mono- and
      disaccharides, and meat and increased subsequent CD risk. Studies reported a
      negative association between dietary fiber and fruits and subsequent CD risk.
      High intakes of total fats, total PUFAs, omega-6 fatty acids, and meat were
      associated with an increased risk of UC. High vegetable intake was associated
      with a decreased risk of UC. CONCLUSIONS: High dietary intakes of total fats,
      PUFAs, omega-6 fatty acids, and meat were associated with an increased risk of CD
      and UC. High fiber and fruit intakes were associated with decreased CD risk, and 
      high vegetable intake was associated with decreased UC risk.

TI  - Dietary and nutritional considerations for inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 329-35
LID - 10.1017/S0029665111000097 [doi]
AB  - Nutritional assessment and dietary advice are fundamental to inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) patient management and all patients should have access to a
      dietitian. Newly diagnosed patients often think that their pre-illness diet has
      contributed to the development of their IBD. However, epidemiological evidence to
      support diet as a risk factor is lacking. How the diet contributes to the
      gastrointestinal microbiota is interesting, although the role is not yet clearly 
      defined. Nutritional problems in IBD are common. Malnutrition occurs in up to 85%
      of patients and weight loss affects up to 80% of patients with Crohn's disease
      and 18-62% of patients with ulcerative colitis. Nutritional deficiencies are
      prevalent, particularly in relation to anaemia and osteoporosis. Intestinal
      strictures can be problematic in Crohn's disease and limiting fibrous foods that 
      may cause a mechanical obstruction in the gastrointestinal tract is helpful.
      Patients often explore dietary exclusion to alleviate symptoms but such changes
      may be self-directed or inappropriately advised and can lead to further
      nutritional deficiencies. Some patients experience concurrent functional symptoms
      (e.g. abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, flatulence and diarrhoea) that can
      significantly affect quality of life. Recently, a group of poorly absorbed
      carbohydrates that occur naturally in the diet called fermentable oligo-, di-,
      mono-saccharides and polyols have been associated with functional symptoms by
      intestinal bacterial fermentation leading to rapid gas production, and an osmotic
      effect increasing fluid delivery to the colon. Emerging evidence indicates that a
      diet low in fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols can alleviate
      functional symptoms in IBD.

TI  - Editorial: Can gluten contribute to irritable bowel syndrome?
PG  - 516-8
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2010.490 [doi]
AB  - Functional gastrointestinal disorders are the most common gastroenterological
      problem in our society. Changes in gut function, including pain perception,
      motility, and intestinal permeability, and low-grade inflammation have been
      described in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The triggering factors
      for the described immunity and gut functional changes in patients with IBS are
      not completely understood. Similarly to post-infective IBS, some patients with
      IBS symptoms exhibit immunological evidence of gluten sensitivity but have no
      overt intestinal mucosal injury. They have symptoms that meet the diagnostic
      criteria for IBS and respond symptomatically to exclusion of gluten from the
      diet. Thus, gluten sensitivity may be involved in the pathogenesis of a subgroup 
      of IBS patients. Unfortunately, there remain many unanswered questions regarding 
      the mechanistic link between gluten sensitivity and functional gastrointestinal
      symptoms.

TI  - PillCamColon Capsule for the study of colonic pathology in clinical practice.
      Study of agreement with colonoscopy.
PG  - 69-75
AB  - INTRODUCTION: several studies have pointed out the effectiveness of the PillCam
      colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) compared with the colonoscopy in the study of the
      colonic pathology. AIMS AND METHODS: the objective of our study was to assess the
      agreement in the diagnosis of CCE with conventional colonoscopy as well as its
      sensitivity and specificity, and to describe the findings of the CCE in our
      clinical practice. Consecutive patients with abdominal symptoms were included in 
      the study. The CCE was performed as previously reported (with PEG and sodium
      phosphate as laxative agents). The nature and location of the findings, colonic
      transit time, complications, cleanliness degree and consistency with diagnostic
      colonoscopy, when performed, were analyzed. RESULTS: a total of 144 subjects (67 
      women and 77 men); (52.17 +/- 16.71 years) with the following indications were
      included: screening of Colorectal cancer (88 patients), control after polipectomy
      (24), incomplete colonoscopy (7), rectal bleeding (10), anemia (8), diarrhea (7).
      The CCE exploration was complete in 134/144 cases (93%), with no case of
      retention. The preparation was good-very good in 88/134 (65,6%), fair in 26/134
      (19,4%) and poor in 20/134 (15%) of the cases. The average colonic transit was of
      140.76 min (9-603). Any adverse effect was notified.In 44 cases a colonoscopy was
      carried out after CCE (results were hidden from another endoscopist). Compared to
      colonoscopy, the rate of agreement was 75,6%, the sensitivity was 84% and the
      specificity 62,5%, PPV was 77,7% and NPV was 71,4%.The colonic findings in 134
      CCE were: in 34 cases CCE it did not show lesions, diverticulosis in 63
      explorations, polyps in 43, angiodysplasias in 15, Crohn's Disease in 9 and
      ulcerative colitis in other 8 cases. CONCLUSIONS: the CCE is an effective and
      reliable technique for the detection of lesions in colon, and because of its high
      agreement with the colonoscopy, it could be useful in clinical practice. Further 
      studies with large seria and cost-effectiveness analysis are needed to confirm
      these data.

TI  - Maternal methyl-donor supplementation induces prolonged murine offspring colitis 
      susceptibility in association with mucosal epigenetic and microbiomic changes.
PG  - 1687-96
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddr044 [doi]
AB  - Developmental epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, have been recognized
      as potential pathogenic factors in inflammatory bowel diseases, the hallmark of
      which is an exaggerated immune response against luminal microbes. A methyl-donor 
      (MD) diet can modify DNA methylation at select murine genomic loci during early
      development. The components of the MDs are routinely incorporated into prenatal
      human supplements. Therefore, we studied the effects of maternal MD
      supplementation on offspring colitis susceptibility and colonic mucosal DNA
      methylation and gene expression changes in mice as a model. Additionally, we
      investigated the offspring mucosal microbiomic response to the maternal dietary
      supplementation. Colitis was induced by dextran sulfate sodium. Colonic mucosa
      from offspring of MD-supplemented mothers following reversal to control diet at
      weaning was interrogated by methylation-specific microarrays and pyrosequencing
      at postnatal days 30 (P30) and P90. Transcriptomic changes were analyzed by
      microarray profiling and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain
      reaction. The mucosal microbiome was studied by high throughput pyrosequencing of
      16S rRNA. Maternal MD supplementation induced a striking susceptibility to
      colitis in offspring. This phenotype was associated with colonic mucosal DNA
      methylation and expression changes. Metagenomic analyses did not reveal
      consistent bacteriomic differences between P30 and P90, but showed a prolonged
      effect of the diet on the offspring mucosal microbiome. In conclusion, maternal
      MD supplementation increases offspring colitis susceptibility that associates
      with persistent epigenetic and prolonged microbiomic changes. These findings
      underscore that epigenomic reprogramming relevant to mammalian colitis can occur 
      during early development in response to maternal dietary modifications.

PG  - 387-401
LID - 10.2165/11584820-000000000-00000 [doi]
AB  - Traditionally, half of the direct costs associated with chronic inflammatory
      bowel diseases (IBD) [Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)] have
      related to hospital inpatient treatment for a sub-group of more severely
      affected, often therapy-resistant individuals. The advent of effective but
      relatively expensive biological agents has increased the contribution of drugs to
      overall medical care costs. This has focussed interest on the relative cost
      effectiveness of rival therapies for IBD and, in particular, on the affordability
      of long-term biological therapy. The purpose of this article is to review the
      available literature on this topic and to identify areas for future research.
      Head-to-head trials of competing treatment options are uncommon and clinical
      trials have seldom addressed cost effectiveness. In UC, models have explored the 
      cost utility of 'high-' versus 'standard-' dose 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA)
      therapy and the theoretical impact of improved adherence with once-daily
      formulations. In CD, cost-utility models for anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)
      drugs versus standard care have suggested consistently that incremental benefits 
      are achieved at increased overall cost. However, studies of varying design have
      produced a wide spectrum of incremental cost-effectiveness ratio estimates, which
      highlights the challenges and limitations of existing modelling techniques.

AB  - Protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) is defined as a "state of nutrition in which a 
      deficiency or excess (or imbalance) of energy, protein, and other nutrients
      causes measurable adverse effects on tissue/body form (body shape, size and
      composition) and function, and clinical outcome". Although this definition
      resulted from a long discussion among experts, it lacks concise assessment
      criteria. Essential to an effective practice of nutrition support, however, is
      the ability to identify who actually needs medical nutrition therapy. Patients
      with active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are a high risk group for
      protein-energy malnutrition, with a prevalence ranging up to 75%.

TI  - Gluten causes gastrointestinal symptoms in subjects without celiac disease: a
      double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 508-14; quiz 515
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2010.487 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Despite increased prescription of a gluten-free diet for
      gastrointestinal symptoms in individuals who do not have celiac disease, there is
      minimal evidence that suggests that gluten is a trigger. The aims of this study
      were to determine whether gluten ingestion can induce symptoms in non-celiac
      individuals and to examine the mechanism. METHODS: A double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled rechallenge trial was undertaken in patients with irritable
      bowel syndrome in whom celiac disease was excluded and who were symptomatically
      controlled on a gluten-free diet. Participants received either gluten or placebo 
      in the form of two bread slices plus one muffin per day with a gluten-free diet
      for up to 6 weeks. Symptoms were evaluated using a visual analog scale and
      markers of intestinal inflammation, injury, and immune activation were monitored.
      RESULTS: A total of 34 patients (aged 29-59 years, 4 men) completed the study as 
      per protocol. Overall, 56% had human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8. 
      Adherence to diet and supplements was very high. Of 19 patients (68%) in the
      gluten group, 13 reported that symptoms were not adequately controlled compared
      with 6 of 15 (40%) on placebo (P=0.0001; generalized estimating equation). On a
      visual analog scale, patients were significantly worse with gluten within 1 week 
      for overall symptoms (P=0.047), pain (P=0.016), bloating (P=0.031), satisfaction 
      with stool consistency (P=0.024), and tiredness (P=0.001). Anti-gliadin
      antibodies were not induced. There were no significant changes in fecal
      lactoferrin, levels of celiac antibodies, highly sensitive C-reactive protein, or
      intestinal permeability. There were no differences in any end point in
      individuals with or without DQ2/DQ8. CONCLUSIONS: "Non-celiac gluten intolerance"
      may exist, but no clues to the mechanism were elucidated.

TI  - Salmon diet in patients with active ulcerative colitis reduced the simple
      clinical colitis activity index and increased the anti-inflammatory fatty acid
      index--a pilot study.
PG  - 68-73
LID - 10.3109/00365513.2010.542484 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Data concerning the anti-inflammatory effect of dietary n-3
      polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) are 
      inconsistent. Salmon fillet contains n-3 PUFAs and bioactive peptides that may
      improve its effects compared to fish oil alone. We assessed the efficacy of a
      salmon-rich diet in patients with mild ulcerative colitis. METHODS: An 8-week
      intervention pilot study was designed to assess the effects of 600 grams Atlantic
      salmon consumption weekly in 12 UC patients. Simple clinical colitis activity
      index (SCCAI), a dietary questionnaire, sigmoidoscopy, selected serum
      inflammatory markers, fecal calprotectin, and plasma and rectal biopsy fatty acid
      profiles were assessed before and after intervention. RESULTS: The levels of
      C20:4n-6 arachidonic acid in biopsies after dietary intervention were correlated 
      with histology and endoscopy scores. The concentrations of n-3 PUFAs, C20:5n-3
      eicosapentaenoic acid, C22:6n-3 docosahexaenoic acid, and the n-3/n-6 ratio
      increased in plasma and rectal biopsies. The anti-inflammatory fatty acid index
      (AIFAI) increased both in biopsies and plasma accompanied with a significantly
      reduced SCCAI. CONCLUSION: Based on evidence of SCCAI and AIFAI and a tendency of
      decreased levels of CRP and homocysteine, intake of Atlantic salmon may have
      beneficial effects on disease activity in patients with mild ulcerative colitis.

      eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases in the United States.
PG  - 300-6
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181eb5a9f [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Variation in the prevalence of eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases
      in different geographical regions has not been extensively studied. The aim of
      the present study was to define the regional and national prevalence of
      eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases, and differences in practice approaches.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: We administered a survey electronically to members of the
      American College of Gastroenterology, the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma,
      and Immunology, and the North American Society Pediatric Gastroenterology,
      Hepatology, and Nutrition. Questions pertained to the number and proportion of
      patients seen with eosinophilic gastroenteritis or colitis and eosinophilic
      esophagitis (EoE), and methods used to diagnose and treat these conditions.
      RESULTS: A total of 1836 physicians responded from 10,874 requests (17%
      response). Extrapolating responses from our US sample, we estimated an overall
      prevalence of 52 and 28/100,000 for EoE and eosinophilic gastroenteritis or
      colitis. The patient burden of EoE is higher in urban (0.58) and suburban (0.44) 
      compared with rural settings (0.36, P < 0.0065), observations consistent with
      other allergic disorders. There was also increased prevalence in northeast region
      when calculated by prevalence per 100,000. There was considerable variability in 
      criteria and initial treatment options used to diagnose EoE. Only one-third of
      respondents reported using diagnostic criteria proposed in a 2007 consensus
      document. Seventy-one and 35% of respondents reported treating some patients with
      EoE with a food elimination or elemental diet, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: EoE is 
      diagnosed more often in northeastern states and urban areas. There is
      considerable variability in diagnostic criteria and initial treatment approach
      supporting the need for additional clinical trials and consensus development.

AB  - AIM: Restorative proctocolectomy is the definitive procedure for ulcerative
      colitis. The potential benefits of a minimal invasive approach make it
      appropriate to consider this approach provided that there are no adverse effects.
      The aim of the present study was to report our experience of laparoscopic
      assisted and 'total' laparoscopic restorative proctocolectomy (LRPC) and to
      highlight the difficulties encountered and the functional results obtained.
      METHOD: Electronic data were prospectively collected from all patients who
      underwent laparoscopic restorative proctocolectomy (LRPC) from October 1999 to
      April 2010. RESULTS: Seventy-two (40 male) patients [median body mass index 24
      (19-48) kg/m(2) ] underwent LRPC over 10 years. Three had cancer. Forty-two had
      undergone a previous colectomy (laparoscopic in 38). There were 40 W- and 32
      J-pouch reconstructions; seven were single-port procedures. The median operation 
      time was 210 (75-330) min. There were five (7%) conversions, one of which
      resulted in immediate pouch failure. The median time to full diet was 36 (4-168) 
      h, with a median hospital stay of 7 (2-64) days. There were seven (10%)
      readmissions. Complications were immediate (3%), early (22%) and long term (11%).
      The incidence of failure (excision or indefinite diversion) was 2.7%. The stoma
      has been closed in 67 patients. Median frequency of defaecation was 4/24 h, with 
      normal continence in 90% and the ability to defer during the day in 98%. There
      was no new case of impotence or dyspareunia. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic restorative
      proctocolectomy is safe and gives good results when performed by an experienced
      laparoscopic surgeon.

TI  - Role of the xenobiotic receptor in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1149-62
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21463 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gene-environment interplay modulates inflammatory bowel diseases
      (IBD). Dioxin-like compounds can activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and
      alter macrophage function as well as T-cell polarization. We hypothesized that
      attenuation of the AhR signaling pathway will ameliorate colitis in a murine
      model of IBD. METHODS: Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis was induced in
      C57BL/6 AhR null mice (AhR(-/-) ), heterozygous mice (AhR(-/+) ), and their
      wildtype (WT) littermates. Clinical and morphopathological parameters were used
      to compare the groups. PATIENTS: AhR pathway activation was analyzed in biopsy
      specimens from 25 IBD patients and 15 healthy controls. RESULTS: AhR(-/-) mice
      died before the end of the treatment. However, AhR(-/+) mice exhibited decreased 
      disease activity compared to WT mice. The AhR(-/+) mice expressed less
      proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) (6.1-
      versus 15.7-fold increase) and IL17 (23.7- versus 67.9-fold increase) and
      increased antiinflammatory IL-10 (2.3-fold increase) compared with the AhR(+/+)
      mice in the colon. Colonic macrophage infiltration was attenuated in the AhR(-/+)
      group. AhR and its downstream targets were significantly upregulated in IBD
      patients versus control (CYP1A1 -19.9, and IL8- 10-fold increase). CONCLUSIONS:
      Attenuation of the AhR receptor expression resulted in a protective effect during
      DSS-induced colitis, while the absence of AhR exacerbated the disease. Abnormal
      AhR pathway activation in the intestinal mucosa of IBD patients may promote
      chronic inflammation. Modulation of AhR signaling pathway via the diet, cessation
      of smoking, or administration of AhR antagonists could be viable strategies for
      the treatment of IBD.

TI  - Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery is feasible in complex colorectal resections
      and could enable day case colectomy.
PG  - 835-40
LID - 10.1007/s00464-010-1275-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fast-track surgery accelerates recovery, reduces morbidity, and
      shortens hospital stay. However, the benefits of laparoscopic versus open surgery
      remain unproven within a fast-track program. Case reports of laparoendoscopic
      single-site (LESS) colectomies are appearing with claims of cosmetic advantage
      and decreased parietal trauma. This report describes the largest case series of
      LESS colorectal surgery and its effects on recovery. METHODS: In this series, 20 
      consecutive unselected patients underwent LESS colorectal surgery including right
      hemicolectomy (n = 3), extended right hemicolectomy, high anterior resection (n =
      2), low anterior resection involving total mesorectal excision (TME; n = 3),
      ileocolic anastomosis (n = 2, including 1 redo surgery), colectomy and ileorectal
      anastomosis (n = 4, including 1 with ventral mesh rectopexy), panproctocolectomy 
      (n = 2), proctocolectomy and ileoanal pouch (n = 2) and an abdominoperineal
      excision of rectum. Single-port conventional instrumentation and transversus
      abdominus plane (TAP) block analgesia were used. The indications included cancer 
      (n = 8), Crohn's disease (n = 4), ulcerative colitis (n = 3) complicated
      diverticulosis (n = 2), and slow-transit constipation (n = 3). Eight of the
      patients had undergone previous surgery. RESULTS: Most of the cases (90%) were
      managed successfully using the LESS technique and conventional instrumentation.
      Two operations (10%) were converted to standard laparoscopy, due to insufficient 
      theater time and an unstable port. The operative time ranged from 45 to 240 min
      (median, 110 min). A normal diet was tolerated within 6 h by 7 patients and in 12
      to 16 h (overnight) by 11 patients. Complications included anastomotic bleed (n =
      1), ileus (n = 2), acute renal failure secondary to hyperphosphatemia and
      hypocalcemia (n = 1), urine retention (n = 1), and wound infection (n = 1). The
      median hospital stay was 46 h (range, 7-384 h). Eight patients were discharged
      within 24 h. There was one readmission (5%). CONCLUSION: Laparoendoscopic
      single-site colorectal resection using conventional instrumentation is feasible
      and safe when performed by an experienced team. The LESS approach may have
      advantages in terms of minimal pain, cosmesis, lower costs, and faster recovery. 
      A randomized trial is required to confirm whether LESS offers a true patient
      benefit over standard laparoscopic resection.

TI  - Body composition in childhood inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 112-5
LID - 10.1016/j.clnu.2010.07.014 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is known about the impact of disease and treatment on
      the pattern of growth in children with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).
      Significant deficits in height and weight in children with Crohn's disease have
      been reported but changes in fat and fat free mass are less well defined. This
      study aims to describe the height, weight and body composition of a cohort of
      children with IBD. METHODS: Height, weight, skinfold thicknesses and
      bioelectrical impedance analysis was performed. Disease activity was assessed
      with clinical scoring systems. RESULTS: 55 children, median age 13.7 years (range
      6.5-17.7) were studied. Median (25th, 75th percentile) Standard Deviation Score
      for BMI, Height and Weight were - 0.3 (- 0.97, 0.65), - 0.56 (- 1.42, 0.06), -
      0.62 (- 1.43, 0.19). In Crohn's disease, using multiple regression analysis
      disease activity measured by PCDAI was significantly inversely related to fat
      free mass (beta - 0.2, 95% CI -0.17, -0.03, p 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Children with 
      IBD were both under and overweight. Nutritional deficits were more common in
      Crohn's disease. Fat free mass was related to disease activity in children with
      Crohn's disease regardless of changes in weight. Weight or BMI may mask deficits 
      in lean tissue in the presence of normal or increased proportions of body fat.

PG  - 744-7
LID - 10.1111/j.1463-1318.2010.02272.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: Ischaemic colitis is uncommon. Aetiological factors include abdominal aortic
      surgery, drugs (especially inotropics) or rheumatoid diseases, such as Takayasu's
      or Buerger's diseases. However, there is often no triggering factor, and it may
      be part of multifactorial cardiac, respiratory, renal or metabolic failure.
      METHOD: A systematic review of the current literature on the management of
      ischaemic colitis was carried out. RESULTS: Ten retrospective trials (841
      patients) were included. No randomized controlled or prospective trial of the
      management of ischaemic colitis was found. CONCLUSION: There is very little
      evidence base for the management of this condition.
