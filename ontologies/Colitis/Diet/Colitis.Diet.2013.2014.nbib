TI  - Dismicrobism in inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer: changes in
      response of colocytes.
PG  - 18121-30
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i48.18121 [doi]
AB  - Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have an increased risk of 10%-15% 
      developing colorectal cancer (CRC) that is a common disease of high economic
      costs in developed countries. The CRC has been increasing in recent years and its
      mortality rates are very high. Multiple biological and biochemical factors are
      responsible for the onset and progression of this pathology. Moreover, it appears
      absolutely necessary to investigate the environmental factors favoring the onset 
      of CRC and the promotion of colonic health. The gut microflora, or microbiota,
      has an extensive diversity both quantitatively and qualitatively. In utero, the
      intestine of the mammalian fetus is sterile. At birth, the intestinal microbiota 
      is acquired by ingesting maternal anal or vaginal organisms, ultimately
      developing into a stable community, with marked variations in microbial
      composition between individuals. The development of IBD is often associated with 
      qualitative and quantitative disorders of the intestinal microbial flora
      (dysbiosis). The healthy human gut harbours about 10 different bacterial species 
      distributed in colony forming units which colonize the gastrointestinal tract.
      The intestinal microbiota plays a fundamental role in health and in the
      progression of diseases such as IBD and CRC. In healthy subjects, the main
      control of intestinal bacterial colonization occurs through gastric acidity but
      other factors such as endoluminal temperature, competition between different
      bacterial strains, peristalsis and drugs can influence the intestinal
      microenvironment. The microbiota exerts diverse physiological functions to
      include: growth inhibition of pathogenic microorganisms, synthesis of compounds
      useful for the trophism of colonic mucosa, regulation of intestinal lymphoid
      tissue and synthesis of amino acids. Furthermore, mucus seems to play an
      important role in protecting the intestinal mucosa and maintaining its integrity.
      Changes in the microbiota composition are mainly influenced by diet and age, as
      well as genetic factors. Increasing evidence indicates that dysbiosis favors the 
      production of genotoxins and metabolites associated with carcinogenesis and
      induces dysregulation of the immune response which promotes and sustains
      inflammation in IBD leading to carcinogenesis. A disequilibrium in gut microflora
      composition leads to the specific activation of gut associated lymphoid tissue.
      The associated chronic inflammatory process associated increases the risk of
      developing CRC. Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are the two major IBDs
      characterized by an early onset and extraintestinal manifestations, such as
      rheumatoid arthritis. The pathogenesis of both diseases is complex and not yet
      fully known. However, it is widely accepted that an inappropriate immune response
      to microbial flora can play a pivotal role in IBD pathogenesis.

AB  - A 75-year-old man with ulcerative colitis (UC) and diet controlled diabetes
      mellitus presented with a 3-week history of slightly itchy, red plaques on both
      lower limbs ascending gradually to cover the trunk and arms. One week later, he
      developed a flare up of his UC. Routine blood tests showed modest drop in
      haemoglobin (122 g/L) and C reactive protein (85 mg/L). Serology was remarkable
      for high antiproteinase 3 (c-ANCA). Serum electrophoresis showed a mildly
      positive paraprotein band (gamma region). Stool culture was negative. Urine
      analysis showed proteinuria. Skin biopsy showed features of urticarial vasculitis
      (UV). He underwent a flexible sigmoidoscopy after the flare up showed mildly
      active UC. The patient was given hydrocortisone for 7 days and then prednisolone.
      Both rash and UC subsided. Electrophoresis was repeated 4 weeks later showing
      normal pattern. Prednisolone has been gradually reduced. Although rare, UV can be
      considered as one of the skin manifestations of UC.

TI  - IBD: microbiota manipulation through diet and modified bacteria.
PG  - 18-25
LID - 10.1159/000367821 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are both
      typified by an altered intestinal microbiota, and gene associations imply various
      defects in the mucosal barrier and in the innate immune response to bacteria.
      This review aims to assess how alterations in diet or use of modified bacteria
      could have therapeutic effects in CD or UC. METHODS: A MEDLINE search using the
      terms 'prebiotic', 'genetically modified bacteria', 'mucosal barrier in
      association with ulcerative colitis', 'Crohn's disease' or 'microbiota'. RESULTS:
      A large body of data from in vitro and animal studies shows promise for
      therapeutic approaches that target the microbiota. Approaches include dietary
      supplementation with fermentable fibres (prebiotics) and soluble fibres that
      block bacterial-epithelial adherence (contrabiotics), enhancement of the mucosal 
      barrier with phosphatidylcholine, and use of genetically modified bacteria that
      express IL-10 or protease inhibitors. Vitamin D supplementation also shows
      promise, acting via enhancement of innate immunity. Clinical trials have shown
      benefit with enterically delivered phosphatidylcholine supplementation in UC and 
      near-significant benefit with vitamin D supplementation in CD. CONCLUSION:
      Strategies that target the microbiota or the host defence against it appear to be
      good prospects for therapy and deserve greater investment.

TI  - Quality of life considering patients with chronic inflammatory bowel diseases -
      natural and parenteral nutrition.

AB  - UNLABELLED: One of the elements of treatment considering inflammatory bowel
      diseases is nutritional therapy. The duration of the above-mentioned depends on
      the prevalence of such symptoms as fever, bowel movements, length of the
      functioning gastrointestinal tract, stoma and intestinal fistula presence.
      Nutritional therapy is an essential element of successful treatment alongside
      pharmacological, surgical, and biological therapy, as well as other methods.
      Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis considered as chronic diseases, lead
      towards physical and biopsychosocial disability, being responsible for the
      reduction in the quality of life. The aim of the study was to determine the
      quality of life after surgical procedures in case of patients diagnosed with
      Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, subjected to natural and parenteral
      nutrition. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group comprised 52 patients from the
      Department of Gastroenterology, Military Medical Institute, and Department of
      Surgery and Clinical Nutrition, Clinical Hospital in Warsaw. The study was
      performed between October, 2011 and April, 2012. The World Health Organization
      Quality of Life Instrument - Bref (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire was used to
      deter-mine the patients' quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: A lower quality of life
      was observed in case of patients subjected to parenteral nutrition, poor
      education, disease symptoms exacerbation, in the majority-rural inhabitants. The 
      quality of life does not depend on gender, type of disease, family status, and
      additional medical care.

AB  - Characterized by colonic mucosa intraepithelial lymphocytosis, lymphocytic
      colitis is primarily an entity presented in the middle-aged to elderly patient
      population. Very few large series of lymphocytic colitis of childhood occurrence 
      are available in the medical literature. Ten cases each of lymphocytic colitis
      and of colonic lymphocytosis of other diagnosis, all with duodenal
      disaccharidases analysis data, were collected from the files of our institution. 
      The electronic medical records were reviewed and multiple variables were
      analyzed. The ten patients with lymphocytic colitis presented with diarrhea. Of
      these, three had abdominal pain. The age range was 2-18 years. Nearly all
      patients were Caucasian (90%) and 70% were female. Endoscopically, most had
      normal appearing colonic mucosa. Significant past medical history, family medical
      history and associated comorbidities included celiac disease, Down syndrome,
      juvenile arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. Interestingly, the most
      revealing observation was that the majority of cases (80%) were associated with
      lactase deficiency and, for the most part, gastrointestinal symptoms improved
      simply by treatment with Lactaid or avoidance of dairy products. This association
      is statistically significant. Our clinicopathological study indicates that the
      typical pediatric patient is a female Caucasian. A large of portion of the
      patients had associated lactase deficiency and improved on Lactaid supplement
      alone.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), most commonly ulcerative colitis (UC) and
      Crohn's disease (CD), is a chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract.
      Patients affected with IBD experience symptoms including abdominal pain,
      persistent diarrhea, rectal bleeding, and weight loss. There is no cure for IBD; 
      thus treatments typically focus on preventing complications, inducing and
      maintaining remission, and improving quality of life. During IBD, dysregulation
      of the intestinal immune system leads to increased production of pro-inflammatory
      cytokines, such as TNF-alpha and IL-6, and recruitment of activated immune cells 
      to the intestine, causing tissue damage and perpetuating the inflammatory
      response. Recent biological therapies targeting specific inflammatory cytokines
      or pathways, in particular TNF-alpha, have shown promise, but not all patients
      respond to treatment, and some individuals become intolerant to treatment over
      time. Dietary peptides and amino acids (AAs) have been shown to modulate
      intestinal immune functions and influence inflammatory responses, and may be
      useful as alternative or ancillary treatments in IBD. This review focuses on
      dietary interventions for IBD treatment, in particular the role of dietary
      peptides and AAs in reducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in the
      gut, as well as recent advances in the cellular mechanisms responsible for their 
      anti-inflammatory activity.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an idiopathic disease thought to be caused by
      a dysregulated immune response to host intestinal microflora. The role of genetic
      factors is indicated by familial clustering of cases and higher incidence in
      monozygotic twins. An interaction between genetic and environmental factors is
      thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of these disorders. Changes in diet,
      antibiotic use and intestinal colonization have likely contributed to increased
      prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease in the past century. Environmental
      factors or infections are thought to alter the barrier function of the
      epithelium, leading to loss of immune tolerance to intestinal antigens. This loss
      of tolerance activates dendritic cells, triggering their transport to mesenteric 
      lymph nodes, where they promote differentiation of naive T cells to TH-1, TH-2,
      TH-17 cells or T regulatory cells. Production of proinflammatory cytokines and
      chemokines then follows. Circulating effector and regulatory cells enter the
      intestine through a highly selective mechanism that involves interaction with the
      vascular endothelium, diapedesis through the vessel wall and migration to the
      lamina propria. There are several genes implicated in IBD. Mutations in certain
      genes can cause defective down regulation of the innate immune response,
      ineffective clearance of intracellular bacteria and proliferation of both luminal
      and mucosal-adherent commensal bacteria. IBD is a chronic relapsing inflammatory 
      condition that is immune mediated. Results from research in animal models, human 
      genetics, basic science and clinical trials provide evidence that it is
      heterogeneous, characterized by various genetic abnormalities, leading to a
      dysregulated and overly aggressive T cell response to commensal enteric bacteria.
      Different genetic abnormalities can be characterized as causing defects in
      mucosal barrier function, immunoregulation or bacterial clearance. Advances in
      our understanding of the interplay between components of innate and adaptive
      immune response will be central to future progress.

TI  - A mixed-method study on the generic and ostomy-specific quality of life of cancer
      and non-cancer ostomy patients.
PG  - 1689-97

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to compare the generic and ostomy-specific
      quality of life (QoL) between cancer and non-cancer ostomy patients using a
      mixed-method design. METHODS: All patients with an ostomy participating in the
      Stomapanel of the Dutch Ostomy Association were asked to complete a generic
      (RAND-36) and ostomy-specific (Stoma-QoL) QoL questionnaire. In addition,
      open-ended questions on symptoms, restrictions or adaptations influencing daily
      life were included. The generic and ostomy-specific QoL between cancer and
      non-cancer ostomy patients were compared using linear regression analyses.
      Qualitative responses were analysed using content analysis. RESULTS: In total,
      668 patients were included: 379 cancer patients (80 % colorectal, 17 % bladder
      and 3 % other) and 289 non-cancer patients (38 % colitis ulcerosa, 22 % Crohn's
      disease and 40 % other) with a colostomy (55 %), ileostomy (31 %) and/or urostomy
      (16 %). Adjusted for gender, age, type of ostomy and time elapsed since ostomy
      surgery, cancer ostomy patients scored higher (better) on Stoma-QoL (beta = 2.1) 
      and all RAND-36 domains (9.1 < beta </= 19.5) except on mental health compared to
      non-cancer ostomy patients. Of the 33 themes coded for in the content analysis,
      fatigue or sleeplessness, leakages, pain, bladder or bowel complaints, physical
      functioning or activity, travelling or being away from home, other daily
      activities (including work), clothing and diet were among the 10 most frequently 
      reported themes, although ranking differed between both patient groups. Besides, 
      cancer ostomy patients frequently reported on the impact on (engaging in a)
      relationship or sexual intimacy and non-cancer ostomy patients frequently
      reported to be relieved of symptoms and restrictions in daily life. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Cancer patients reported better generic and ostomy-specific QoL than non-cancer
      ostomy patients. In both cancer and non-cancer ostomy patients, fatigue or
      sleeplessness, leakages, pain, bladder or bowel complaints, physical functioning 
      or activity, travelling or being away from home, other daily activities
      (including work), clothing and diet were among the 10 most common reported themes
      influencing daily life. However, the ranking of these 10 most common themes was
      different in both patient groups.

PG  - 493-507
LID - 10.5152/tjg.2014.4955 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: To investigate the prevalence of malnutrition in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by subjective global assessment (SGA) and the
      effects of oral nutritional support on the clinical parameters, consumption of
      energy, macronutrients and fiber intake in the Study and Control groups,
      prospectively. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 38 (28 Male; 10 Female)
      hospitalized patients with moderate or severe IBD (13 with Crohn's disease (CD); 
      25 with Ulcerative colitis (UC)) were included. At stage 1, the disease severity,
      clinical symptoms and, signs, food consumption and nutritional status by using
      subjective global assessment (SGA) were recorded. At stage 2, the patients were
      blindly randomized into a Study Group and Controls. In the Study Group, a
      standard enteral product was added into the regulated hospital diets, but for the
      Controls, deficits were regulated by only hospital diets for 3 weeks. the
      independent variables were the group, the disease and its activity, age, Body
      body mass index (BMI), weight loss history, the hospitalization period; the
      dependent variables were SGA, bowel movements, change in nutritional status,
      disease severity, clinical findings, and also consumption of macronutrients.
      RESULTS: Prevalance of malnutrition (SGA-B or SGA-C) for all the patients was
      92.1% at the beginning and 71.1% at the end of study. Improvements in disease
      activity score for the patients with UC were statistically significant in both
      the Study Group and the Controls (p=0.006 for the Study Group and p=0.001 for the
      Controls, respectively). Macronutrients, total and water soluble fiber
      consumption levels improved, with statistically significant differences for all
      the groups. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of malnutrition is a major problem in
      patients with IBD. Not only the regulation of hospital food, but also enteral
      nutritional support, improved their levels of malnutrition, as well as their
      energy, macronutrients, and fiber consumption, and SGA is an easy method for
      nutritional monitoring.

AB  - Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) is an important molecule in mediating
      inflammatory colitis, which can lead to colorectal cancer (CRC). The aim of this 
      study was to evaluate the chemopreventive efficacy of apple polysaccharide
      extract (AP) in inhibiting NF-kappaB-mediated inflammation pathways in CRC. We
      evaluated AP in vitro in HT-29 and SW620 human CRC cells. We also used the
      azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulphate (AOM/DSS) model to induce colon
      carcinogenesis in vivo. The chemoprotective effects of AP were assessed using
      Western blot, immunofluorescence assay, real-time PCR, electrophoretic mobility
      shift assay, and flow cytometry. AP reduced AOM/DSS-associated toxicities,
      prevented carcinogenesis, and decreased the expression of TLR4, MD2, MyD88, TRAM,
      TRIF-related adapter molecule, interferon-beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and 
      interleukin-6. The protective effects of AP may be related to the inhibition of
      TLR4/MD2-mediated signaling, including MyD88 and TRIF, as well as the inhibition 
      of NF-kappaB-mediated inflammatory signaling pathways. Therefore, AP could be
      used in combination therapy for the prevention of colitis-associated colon
      cancer.

TI  - Environmental factors in the relapse and recurrence of inflammatory bowel
      disease: a review of the literature.
PG  - 1396-405
LID - 10.1007/s10620-014-3437-3 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The causes of relapse in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and
      ulcerative colitis (UC) are largely unknown. This paper reviews the
      epidemiological and clinical data on how medications (non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs, estrogens and antibiotics), lifestyle factors (smoking, 
      psychological stress, diet and air pollution) may precipitate clinical relapses
      and recurrence. Potential biological mechanisms include: increasing thrombotic
      tendency, imbalances in prostaglandin synthesis, alterations in the composition
      of gut microbiota, and mucosal damage causing increased permeability. RESULTS:
      The clinical epidemiological data consistently reports positive associations
      between smoking and relapses in CD, and inverse ones with UC. For NSAIDs and
      estrogens, the epidemiological findings are inconsistent, although general
      antibiotic use was associated with a reduced risk of relapse in CD. High levels
      of stress were positively associated with relapse, although psychological
      interventions did not have therapeutic benefits. The limited work on diet has
      reported sulphur-containing foods are positively associated with relapse in UC,
      but there is no work in CD. Ecological data reported positive correlations
      between air pollution levels and IBD hospitalisations. CONCLUSIONS: In the
      future, to clarify this area, more clinical epidemiological work is required
      where detailed drug types and doses, and complete dietary intakes are measured,
      in specific forms of IBD. Such work could provide guidance to both patients and
      doctors to help maintain remission.

TI  - Enteric microbiota leads to new therapeutic strategies for ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 15657-63
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i42.15657 [doi]
AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a leading form of inflammatory bowel disease that
      involves chronic relapsing or progressive inflammation. As a significant
      proportion of UC patients treated with conventional therapies do not achieve
      remission, there is a pressing need for the development of more effective
      therapies. The human gut contains a large, diverse, and dynamic population of
      microorganisms, collectively referred to as the enteric microbiota. There is a
      symbiotic relationship between the human host and the enteric microbiota, which
      provides nutrition, protection against pathogenic organisms, and promotes immune 
      homeostasis. An imbalance of the normal enteric microbiota composition (termed
      dysbiosis) underlies the pathogenesis of UC. A reduction of enteric microbiota
      diversity has been observed in UC patients, mainly affecting the
      butyrate-producing bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, which can
      repress pro-inflammatory cytokines. Many studies have shown that enteric
      microbiota plays an important role in anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory
      activities, which can benefit UC patients. Therefore, manipulation of the
      dysbiosis is an attractive approach for UC therapy. Various therapies targeting a
      restoration of the enteric microbiota have shown efficacy in treating patients
      with active and chronic forms of UC. Such therapies include fecal microbiota
      transplantation, probiotics, prebiotics, antibiotics, helminth therapy, and
      dietary polyphenols, all of which can alter the abundance and composition of the 
      enteric microbiota. Although there have been many large, randomized controlled
      clinical trials assessing these treatments, the effectiveness and safety of these
      bacteria-driven therapies need further evaluation. This review focuses on the
      important role that the enteric microbiota plays in maintaining intestinal
      homeostasis and discusses new therapeutic strategies targeting the enteric
      microbiota for UC.

AB  - Intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) plays an essential role in intestinal
      homeostasis and health through interactions with the resident microbiota, diet
      and the gut. IAP's role in the intestine is to dephosphorylate toxic microbial
      ligands such as lipopolysaccharides, unmethylated cytosine-guanosine
      dinucleotides and flagellin as well as extracellular nucleotides such as uridine 
      diphosphate. IAP's ability to detoxify these ligands is essential in protecting
      the host from sepsis during acute inflammation and chronic inflammatory
      conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease. Also important in these
      complications is IAP's ability to regulate the microbial ecosystem by forming a
      complex relationship between microbiota, diet and the intestinal mucosal surface.
      Evidence reveals that diet alters IAP expression and activity and this in turn
      can influence the gut microbiota and homeostasis. IAP's ability to maintain a
      healthy gastrointestinal tract has accelerated research on its potential use as a
      therapeutic agent against a multitude of diseases. Exogenous IAP has been shown
      to have beneficial effects when administered during ulcerative colitis, coronary 
      bypass surgery and sepsis. There are currently a handful of human clinical trials
      underway investigating the effects of exogenous IAP during sepsis, rheumatoid
      arthritis and heart surgery. In light of these findings IAP has been marked as a 
      novel agent to help treat a variety of other inflammatory and infectious
      diseases. The purpose of this review is to highlight the essential
      characteristics of IAP in protection and maintenance of intestinal homeostasis
      while addressing the intricate interplay between IAP, diet, microbiota and the
      intestinal epithelium.

AB  - In this paper a review of the researches on the role of Escherichia coli strain
      Nissle 1917 (EcN) in gastrointestinal diseases was presented. EcN is a
      non-pathogenic strain of the Enterobacteriaceae family, which has probiotic
      properties. In a number of studies conducted among humans and experimental
      animals the application of EcN in treatment of gastrointestinal diseases was
      observed. Most studies about EcN has been devoted to this organism efficacy in
      ulcerative colitis treatment. Comparable results were obtained, by citied
      authors, in the treatment (sustaining remission) of EcN and mesalazine in
      ulcerative colitis. Moreover, this probiotic therapy, compared to placebo,
      contributes to obtaining a faster remission and improvement of intestinal
      histopathology. The use of EcN in Crohn's disease has not been the subject of as 
      many studies as in the case of ulcerative colitis. Assessing the importance of
      EcN in treatment of other gastrointestinal disorders, authors of the studies
      observed, that in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, who receiving this
      probiotic there was a pain, nausea and bloating reduction. In studies conducted
      among children a positive impact of EcN in prevention and treatment of diarrhea
      was demonstrated. Similar results were obtained in studies conducted in
      experimental animals. Based on the presented review it can be concluded that the 
      strain of Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 is useful in treatment of gastrointestinal
      diseases, especially in treatment of ulcerative colitis. This probiotic may
      constitute a part of treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and diarrhea. The
      effectiveness of this strain in treatment of Crohn's disease is not clearly
      established and further research are require.

TI  - Pre-illness isoflavone consumption and disease risk of ulcerative colitis: a
      multicenter case-control study in Japan.
PG  - e110270
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0110270 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have suggested that estrogens play a role in the
      development of ulcerative colitis (UC). Because isoflavones have a similar
      structure to 17beta-estradiol, dietary consumption of isoflavones may have
      similar influences on the development of UC. We examined the association between 
      pre-illness isoflavone consumption and the risk of UC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We 
      conducted a hospital-based case control study, and compared the dietary habits of
      126 newly diagnosed UC cases with those of 170 age- and gender-matched hospital
      controls. Information on dietary factors was collected using a self-administered 
      diet history questionnaire. To consider potential changes in dietary habits due
      to disease symptoms, the habits were assessed separately during the previous 1
      month and at 1 year before the recruitment. RESULTS: In the assessment of dietary
      habits during the previous 1 month, the highest tertile of isoflavone consumption
      revealed an increased odds ratio (OR) for UC (OR = 2.79; 95% confidence interval 
      (CI), 1.39-5.59; Trend P = 0.004). A significant association was also observed
      for the dietary assessment at 1 year before, when most UC cases had not yet
      experienced their first disease symptoms (OR = 2.06; 95% CI, 1.05-4.04; Trend P =
      0.04). Associations were more pronounced in females (OR in highest tertile of
      isoflavone consumption at 1 year before = 4.76; 95% CI, 1.30-17.5; Trend P =
      0.02) but were obscured in males (corresponding OR = 1.21; 95% CI, 0.49-3.01;
      Trend P = 0.63). CONCLUSIONS: Dietary isoflavone consumption may be associated
      with an increased risk of UC, particularly in females. Prospective cohort studies
      are warranted to confirm these findings.

AB  - Whole-grain foods such as oats may protect against colorectal cancer and have
      benefits on inflammatory bowel disease and coeliac disease. The present study
      aimed to systematically review the literature describing intervention studies
      that investigated the effects of oats or oat bran on risk factors for bowel
      disease. A literature search was conducted using Embase, Medline and the Cochrane
      library, which identified 654 potential articles. Thirty-eight articles
      describing twenty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Two studies carried
      out in participants with a history of colorectal adenomas found no effects of
      increased oat-bran intake on indirect risk makers for colorectal cancer. One of
      two interventions with oat bran in patients with ulcerative colitis showed small 
      improvements in the patients' conditions. Most of the eleven studies carried out 
      in adults with coeliac disease showed no negative effects of uncontaminated oat
      consumption. The fourteen studies carried out in volunteers with no history of
      bowel disease suggest that oats or oat bran can significantly increase stool
      weight and decrease constipation, but there is a lack of evidence to support a
      specific effect of oats on bowel function compared with other cereals. A
      long-term dietary intake of oats or oat bran could benefit inflammatory bowel
      disorders, but this remains to be proven. A protective effect on colorectal
      adenoma and cancer incidence has not yet been convincingly shown. The majority of
      patients with coeliac disease could consume up to 100 g/d of uncontaminated oats,
      which would increase the acceptability of, and adherence to, a gluten-free diet.

TI  - Carbohydrate intake in the etiology of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 2013-21
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000168 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diet may have a role in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease.
      In previous studies, the associations between increased intakes of carbohydrates,
      sugar, starch, and inflammatory bowel disease are inconsistent. However, few
      prospective studies have investigated the associations between these
      macronutrients and incident Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC).
      METHODS: A total of 401,326 men and women were recruited between 1991 and 1998.
      At recruitment, dietary intakes of carbohydrate, sugar, and starch were measured 
      using validated food frequency questionnaires. The cohort was monitored
      identifying participants who developed incident CD or UC. Cases were matched with
      4 controls, and odds ratios were calculated for quintiles of total carbohydrate, 
      sugar, and starch intakes adjusted for total energy intake, body mass index, and 
      smoking. RESULTS: One hundred ten participants developed CD, and 244 participants
      developed UC during follow-up. The adjusted odds ratio for the highest versus the
      lowest quintiles of total carbohydrate intake for CD was 0.87, 95% CI = 0.24 to
      3.12 and for UC 1.46, 95% CI = 0.62 to 3.46, with no significant trends across
      quintiles for either (CD, P trend = 0.70; UC, P trend = 0.41). Similarly, no
      associations were observed with intakes of total sugar (CD, P trend = 0.50; UC, P
      trend = 0.71) or starch (CD, P trend = 0.69; UC, P trend = 0.17). CONCLUSIONS:
      The lack of associations with these nutrients is in agreement with many
      case-control studies that have not identified associations with CD or UC. As
      there is biological plausibility for how specific carbohydrates could have an
      etiological role in inflammatory bowel disease, future epidemiological work
      should assess individual carbohydrates, although there does not seem to be a
      macronutrient effect.

TI  - Do patients living with ulcerative colitis adhere to healthy eating guidelines? A
      cross-sectional study.
PG  - 1628-35

AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease that causes
      gastrointestinal lesions, bleeding, diarrhoea and nutritional complications.
      Insufficient nutrient intake can additionally deteriorate nutritional status. The
      present cross-sectional study aimed to determine whether UC patients adhere to
      national dietary guidelines and to assess their dietary habits. An online
      questionnaire (n 93) was used to assess health-related conditions, current
      nutritional knowledge, professional dietary guidance and food avoidance. A 24 h
      dietary recall (n 81) was used to assess nutrient intakes, which were then
      compared with the national recommended intake values. The results showed that the
      nutritional knowledge of participants was limited with unofficial sources being
      used, including websites. Numerous food groups, predominantly fibre-rich foods
      and fruit and vegetables, were largely avoided by the participants. Almost half
      of the study population eliminated foods such as dairy products to alleviate
      symptoms, possibly unnecessarily. Energy intakes were significantly (P< 0.05)
      lower than the national recommended intake values in women aged 18-65 years and
      men aged 18-60 years. Fat intake exceeded the national recommended intake values 
      (P< 0.0001), at the expense of carbohydrate and fibre intakes, which were
      significantly (P< 0.005) lower than the national recommended intake values.
      Protein intake was significantly high in women aged 19-50 years (P< 0.00) and men
      aged 19-50 years (P< 0.005). Vitamin C, vitamin B12 and Ca intake levels were
      overachieved by all participants (P< 0.001), while women aged 19-50 years did not
      achieve their dietary Fe reference nutrient intake levels (P< 0.001).
      Osteopaenia, osteoporosis and anaemia were reported by 12, 6 and 31 % of the
      participants, respectively. Findings indicate that food avoidance may contribute 
      to nutrient deficiencies in UC patients. Low intakes of these food groups,
      especially during remission, are preventing patients from adhering to dietary
      guidelines.

TI  - Antibiotics, probiotics and prebiotics in IBD.
PG  - 83-100
LID - 10.1159/000360713 [doi]
AB  - The dysbiosis theory of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) posits that there is an 
      alteration in the gut microbiome as an important underpinning of disease
      etiology. It stands to reason then, that administering agents that could impact
      on the balance of microbes on the gut could be impactful on the course of IBD.
      Herein is a review of the controlled trials undertaken to assess the use of
      antibiotics that would kill or suppress potentially injurious microbes,
      probiotics that would overpopulate the gut with potentially beneficial microbes
      or prebiotics that provide a metabolic substrate that enhances the growth of
      potentially beneficial microbes. With regard to antibiotics, the best data are
      for the use of nitroimadoles postoperatively in Crohn's disease (CD) to prevent
      disease recurrence. Otherwise, the data are limited with the regard to any
      lasting benefit of antibiotics sustaining remission in either CD or ulcerative
      colitis (UC). A recent meta-analysis concluded that antibiotics are superior to
      placebo at inducing remission in CD or UC, although the meta-analysis grouped a
      variety of antibiotics with different spectra of activity. Despite the absence of
      robust clinical trial data, antibiotics are widely used to treat perineal
      fistulizing CD and acute and chronic pouchitis. Probiotics have not been shown to
      have a beneficial role in CD. However, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 has
      comparable effects to low doses of mesalamine in maintaining remission in UC.
      VSL#3, a combination of 8 microbes, has been shown to have an effect in inducing 
      remission in UC and preventing pouchitis. Prebiotics have yet to be shown to have
      an effect in any form of IBD, but to date controlled trials have been small. The 
      use of antibiotics should be balanced against the risks they pose. Even
      probiotics may pose some risk and should not be assumed to be innocuous
      especially when ingested by persons with a compromised epithelial barrier.
      Prebiotics may not be harmful but may cause gastrointestinal side effects.
      Finally, the timing of ingestion of antibiotics and other dietary factors that
      may function as prebiotics, especially in early childhood, may be critical in
      shaping the gut microbiome and ultimately predisposing to or preventing IBD.
      Finding ways to impact on the gut microbiome to alter the course of IBD makes
      good sense, but should be undertaken in the setting of rigorously performed
      controlled trials to ensure that the interventions are truly effective and well
      tolerated.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative
      colitis (UC), are chronic debilitating diseases that occur in populations around 
      the world. The underlying etiology is thought to be multifactorial. There is a
      well-defined genetic contribution to the diseases, but this does not fully
      explain the epidemiology. Environmental factors, including the composition of the
      gut microbiota, are also important. There is wide geographic variability in the
      incidence and prevalence of IBD. High incidence rates have been observed in the
      United Kingdom, Northern Europe, Canada, and the United States. Globally, there
      is evidence of increasing incidence of CD and UC over time. The rising incidence 
      of IBD in Western countries has generally predated that in developing nations,
      supporting the hypothesis that 'Westernization' of our lifestyle has led to the
      increased incidence of IBD. Smoking, antibiotic use, and diet are potentially
      reversible risk factors for IBD. Recommendations to avoid smoking are appropriate
      for all people, for numerous reasons. Antibiotic use should be limited to
      appropriate indications, a recommendation that too is appropriate for all
      populations. Detangling the relationship between diet, the gut microbiome and IBD
      raises the potential to reduce the incidence of IBD through dietary modification,
      an approach that might be considered among those at the highest risk.

TI  - Environmental risk factors for inflammatory bowel diseases: a review.
PG  - 290-8
LID - 10.1007/s10620-014-3350-9 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases comprising Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative
      colitis (UC) are chronic immunologically mediated diseases. The key mechanism
      underlying the pathogenesis of these diseases is a dysregulated immune response
      to commensal flora in a genetically susceptible host. Thus intestinal microbial
      dysbiosis, host genetics, and the external environment all play an important role
      in the development of incident disease and in determining subsequent disease
      behavior and outcomes. There are several well-defined or putative environmental
      risk factors including cigarette smoking, appendectomy, diet, stress and
      depression, vitamin D as well as hormonal influence. The effect of some of the
      risk factors appears to differ between CD and UC suggesting that despite shared
      genetic and immunologic mechanisms, distinct pathways of pathogenesis exist.
      There is a growing body of literature identifying risk factors for incident
      disease. There is less rigorous literature defining triggers of relapse, and few 
      controlled clinical trials examining if modification of such risk factors results
      in an improvement in patient outcomes. This is an area of considerable patient,
      physician, and scientific interest, and there is an important unmet need for

TI  - Carnosic acid suppresses colon tumor formation in association with antiadipogenic
      activity.
PG  - 2274-85
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201400293 [doi]
AB  - SCOPE: This study determined the efficacy of carnosic acid (CA) for suppressing
      colon carcinogenesis associated with excess adiposity. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cell 
      growth regulation by CA was evaluated in HT-29 colon adenocarcinoma cells
      cocultured with 3T3-L1 adipocytes. To determine the in vivo efficacies, male A/J 
      mice were divided into four groups and fed one of the following experimental
      diets for 11 wk: 15% fat, 45% fat, 45% fat + 0.01% CA, or 45% fat + 0.02% CA.
      Azoxymethane was administered at the beginning of experimental diet and two
      cycles of dextran sodium sulfate were supplied 1 wk after the azoxymethane
      injection. The proliferation of HT-29 cells cocultured with 3T3-L1 cells was
      significantly higher than proliferation of control cells (p < 0.05). CA treatment
      suppressed the growth of cocultured HT-29 cells through cell cycle arrest and
      enhanced apoptosis by inhibiting leptin receptor (Ob-R) signaling, including Akt 
      and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. CA
      supplementation in vivo decreased the number of colon tumors and reduced
      circulating concentrations of leptin, adiponectin, insulin, and insulin-like
      growth factor 1. Colonic expression of Ob-R, insulin receptor (IR), p-Akt, p-ERK,
      B-cell lymphoma extra large (Bcl-xL), and cyclinD1 protein was also suppressed in
      animals fed CA. CONCLUSION: CA appears to alleviate adipocity-related
      acceleration of colon tumor formation.

TI  - Impaired hydrogen sulfide synthesis and IL-10 signaling underlie
      hyperhomocysteinemia-associated exacerbation of colitis.
PG  - 13559-64
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1413390111 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin B deficiencies, which can lead to hyperhomocysteinemia (Hhcy), are
      commonly reported in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and may be a 
      causative underlying factor. However, the mechanism for this effect is not known.
      Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a gaseous mediator that promotes tissue repair and
      resolution of inflammation. In experimental colitis, a marked increase in colonic
      H2S synthesis drives ulcer healing and resolution of inflammation. Because H2S
      synthesis is in part dependent upon enzymes that require vitamin B6 as a
      cofactor, we tested the hypothesis that Hhcy in rodent models would increase the 
      susceptibility to colitis. In all three models tested, diet-induced Hhcy
      significantly exacerbated colitis. The usual elevation of colonic H2S synthesis
      after induction of colitis was absent in all three models of colitis.
      Administration of an H2S donor to Hhcy rats significantly decreased the severity 
      of colitis. Compared with wild-type mice, interleukin (IL) 10-deficient mice on a
      normal diet had decreased levels of colonic H2S synthesis, a 40% increase in
      serum homocysteine, and a phenotype similar to wild-type mice with Hhcy.
      IL-10-deficient mice fed the vitamin B-deficient diet exhibited more severe
      colonic inflammation, but the normal elevation of colonic H2S synthesis was
      absent. Administration of IL-10 to the IL-10-deficient mice restored colonic H2S 
      synthesis and significantly decreased serum homocysteine levels. These results
      suggest that the exacerbation of colitis in Hhcy is due in part to impaired
      colonic H2S synthesis. Moreover, IL-10 plays a novel role in promoting H2S
      production and homocysteine metabolism, which may have therapeutic value in
      conditions characterized by Hhcy.

AB  - Chlorogenic acid (CHA) is an antioxidant polyphenol prevalent in human diet, with
      coffee, fruits, and vegetables being its main source. Effects of CHA and CHA
      metabolites were evaluated on the IL-8 production in human intestinal Caco-2
      cells induced by combined stimulation with tumour necrosis factor alpha
      (TNFalpha) and H2O2. CHA and caffeic acid (CA) inhibited TNFalpha- and
      H2O2-induced IL-8 production. We also examined the in vivo effects of CHA and CA 
      using dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. CHA attenuated
      DSS-induced body weight loss, diarrhea, fecal blood, and shortening of colon and 
      dramatically improved colitis histological scores. Furthermore, increases in the 
      mRNA expression of colonic macrophage inflammatory protein 2 and IL-1beta, which 
      were induced by DSS, were significantly suppressed by CHA supplementation. These 
      results suggest that dietary CHA use may aid in the prevention of intestinal
      inflammatory conditions.

TI  - Genetic analysis of colon tumors induced by a dietary carcinogen PhIP in CYP1A
      humanized mice: Identification of mutation of beta-catenin/Ctnnb1 as the driver
      gene for the carcinogenesis.
PG  - 1264-74
LID - 10.1002/mc.22199 [doi]
AB  - Replacing mouse Cyp1a with human CYP1A enables the humanized CYP1A mice to mimic 
      human metabolism of the dietary carcinogen,
      2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), by N(2) -hydroxylation to
      a proximate carcinogen. Our previous study demonstrated that PhIP, combined with 
      the dextrin sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, induces colon carcinogenesis in
      hCYP1A mice. Here, we employed whole exome sequencing and found multiple gene
      mutations in PhIP/DSS-induced colon tumors. Mutations in the exon 3 of
      Ctnnb1/beta-catenin, however, were the predominant events. We further sequenced
      the key fragments of Apc, Ctnnb1, and Kras, because mutations of these genes in
      the humans are commonly found as the drivers of colorectal cancer. Mutations on
      either codon 32 or 34 in the exon 3 of Ctnnb1 were found in 39 out of 42 tumors, 
      but no mutation was found in either Apc or Kras. The sequence context of codons
      32 and 34 suggests that PhIP targets +3G in a TGGA motif of Ctnnb1. Since
      mutations that activate Wnt signal is a major driving force for human colorectal 
      cancers, we conclude that the mutated beta-catenin is the driver in
      PhIP/DSS-induced colon carcinogenesis. This result suggests that the colon tumors
      in hCYP1A mice mimic human colorectal carcinogenesis not only in the dietary
      etiology involving PhIP, but also in the aberrant activation of the Wnt signaling
      pathway as the driving force.

TI  - Serum regenerating islet-derived 3-alpha is a biomarker of mucosal enteropathies.
PG  - 974-81

AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical presentation of organic and functional intestinal
      disorders can overlap and clinicians often rely on invasive and time-consuming
      procedures to make a final diagnosis. Regenerating islet-derived 3-alpha
      (Reg3alpha) is detectable in the circulation of patients with intestinal
      graft-versus host disease and patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
      AIM: To determine whether serum Reg3alpha testing is useful for discriminating
      mucosal enteropathies from functional intestinal disorders. METHODS: We
      prospectively included 47 patients with active coeliac disease (ACD), 13 patients
      with refractory coeliac disease (RCD), seven patients with common variable
      immunodeficiency (CVID), 72 patients with active Crohn's disease, 22 patients
      with active ulcerative colitis (UC) and 28 patients with irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS)-related diarrhoea. Sera were also taken from 10 CD patients before and
      after 6-12 months of a gluten-free diet (GFD) and from 14 patients with IBD
      before and after induction therapy with Infliximab (IFX). Sera of 119 healthy
      volunteers were used to determine the cut-off value. Reg3alpha levels were
      measured by a commercial ELISA kit. RESULTS: Levels of Reg3alpha exceeded the
      cut-off value of the assay in 43/47(91%) ACD patients, 13/13(100%) RCD patients, 
      7/7(100%) CVID patients, 65/72(90%) Crohn's disease patients, 17/22(77%) UC
      patients and one patient with IBS(4%). Reg3alpha levels distinguished mucosal
      enteropathies from IBS with a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 96%.
      Reg3alpha levels significantly decreased in CD patients following a GFD and in
      IBD patients after treatment with IFX. CONCLUSION: Reg3alpha is a serum biomarker
      of intestinal damage that, combined with clinical data, identifies patients who
      should undergo invasive tests for diagnosing enteropathies.

TI  - Calorie intake of enteral nutrition and clinical outcomes in acutely critically
      ill patients: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
PG  - 291-300
LID - 10.1177/0148607114544322 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The appropriate calorie intake to be provided to critically ill
      patients via enteral nutrition (EN) remains unclear. We performed a meta-analysis
      of randomized controlled trials to compare the effect of initial underfeeding and
      full feeding in acutely critically ill patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We
      searched the Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 
      databases to identify randomized controlled trials that compared underfeeding
      with full feeding in critically ill patients. The primary outcome was overall
      mortality. The secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay, length of
      intensive care unit (ICU) stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, incidence of 
      pneumonia, Clostridium difficile colitis, other infectious complications, and
      gastrointestinal intolerance. RESULTS: In total, 4 studies were included in this 
      meta-analysis. There was no significant difference in overall mortality between
      the underfeeding and full-feeding groups (odds ratio [OR], 0.94; 95% confidence
      interval [CI], 0.74-1.19; I (2) = 26.6%; P = .61). Subgroup analysis of the
      underfeeding subgroup that was fed >/=33.3% of the standard caloric requirement
      indicated that overall mortality was significantly lower in this underfeeding
      subgroup than in the full-feeding group (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.40-1.00; I (2) = 0%;
      P = .05). In contrast, no difference in overall mortality was noted between the
      underfeeding subgroup that was fed <33.3% of the standard caloric requirement and
      the full-feeding group. The length of hospital stay and length of ICU stay did
      not differ between the 2 groups. Moreover, no differences in other secondary
      clinical outcomes were noted. CONCLUSIONS: None of the analyzed clinical outcomes
      for the acutely critically ill patients were significantly influenced by the
      calorie intake of the initial EN.

AB  - The fundamental elucidation of how environmental influences provoke the
      initiation of disease as well as flares of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      remains incomplete. The current understanding of these diseases suggests that
      ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) result from poorly defined
      interactions between genetic and environmental factors which culminate in the
      pathologic effects and clinical manifestations of these diseases. The genetic
      variant appears not sufficient itself to lead to the development of the clinical 
      disease, but likely must combine with the environmental factors. The intestinal
      microbiome is pivotal to IBD development. A greater understanding of the
      contribution of these factors to dysbiosis is critical, and we aspire to
      restoring a healthy microbiome to treat flares and ideally prevent the
      development of IBD and its complications. This article aims to place the
      environmental influences in the context of their potential contribution to the
      development of the pathophysiology of IBD.

TI  - Diet, microbiota, and inflammatory bowel disease: lessons from Japanese foods.
PG  - 409-15
LID - 10.3904/kjim.2014.29.4.409 [doi]
AB  - The incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) including
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease are rapidly increasing in Western countries 
      and in developed Asian countries. Although biologic agents targeting the immune
      system have been effective in patients with IBD, cessation of treatment leads to 
      relapse in the majority of patients, suggesting that intrinsic immune
      dysregulation is an effect, not a cause, of IBD. Dramatic changes in the
      environment, resulting in the dysregulated composition of intestinal microbiota
      or dysbiosis, may be associated with the fundamental causes of IBD. Japan now has
      upgraded water supply and sewerage systems, as well as dietary habits and
      antibiotic overuse that are similar to such features found in developed Western
      countries. The purpose of this review article was to describe the association of 
      diet, particularly Japanese food and microbiota, with IBD.

PG  - 562-70
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2014-307198 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Colonic fermentation in patients with UC in remission was compared
      with that in matched healthy subjects on habitual diets and when dietary fibre
      was increased. DESIGN: Fibre intake, faecal output of fibre (measured as
      non-starch polysaccharide (NSP)), starch, microbiota and fermentation products,
      and whole gut transit time (WGTT) were assessed in association with habitual diet
      and when dietary intake of wheat bran (WB)-associated fibre and high
      amylose-associated resistant starch (RS) was increased in an 8-week, randomised, 
      single-blind, cross-over study. RESULTS: Despite a tendency to lower habitual
      fibre intake in UC patients, faecal NSP and starch concentrations were threefold 
      higher than in controls, whereas concentrations of phenols and short-chain fatty 
      acids, pH and WGTT were similar. Increasing RS/WB intake was well tolerated. In
      controls (n=10), it more than doubled faecal NSP and starch excretion (p=0.002
      for both), had no effect on NSP usage and reduced WGTT (p=0.024). In UC patients 
      (n=19), high intake of RS/WB tended to normalise gut transit, but did not
      increase the proportion of NSP fermented. Increasing intake of RS/WB had little
      effect on faecal fermentation patterns or the structure of the microbiota.
      However, faeces from the UC cohort had lower proportions of Akkermansia
      muciniphila and increased diversity within Clostridium cluster XIVa compared to
      controls. CONCLUSIONS: Gut fermentation of NSP and starch is diminished in
      patients with UC. This cannot be explained by abnormal gut transit and was not
      corrected by increasing RS/WB intake, and may be due to abnormal functioning of
      the gut microbiota. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Australian New Zealand Clinical

LID - 10.1016/j.redox.2014.06.008 [doi]
AB  - Regular consumption of moderate doses of wine is an integral part of the
      Mediterranean diet, which has long been considered to provide remarkable health
      benefits. Wine's beneficial effect has been attributed principally to its
      non-alcoholic portion, which has antioxidant properties, and contains a wide
      variety of phenolics, generally called polyphenols. Wine phenolics may prevent or
      delay the progression of intestinal diseases characterized by oxidative stress
      and inflammation, especially because they reach higher concentrations in the gut 
      than in other tissues. They act as both free radical scavengers and modulators of
      specific inflammation-related genes involved in cellular redox signaling. In
      addition, the importance of wine polyphenols has recently been stressed for their
      ability to act as prebiotics and antimicrobial agents. Wine components have been 
      proposed as an alternative natural approach to prevent or treat inflammatory
      bowel diseases. The difficulty remains to distinguish whether these positive
      properties are due only to polyphenols in wine or also to the alcohol intake,
      since many studies have reported ethanol to possess various beneficial effects.
      Our knowledge of the use of wine components in managing human intestinal
      inflammatory diseases is still quite limited, and further clinical studies may
      afford more solid evidence of their beneficial effects.

AB  - Cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis is uncommon in young infants. Here we report a case
      of a 10-week-old breastfed infant admitted to the emergency room for rectal
      bleeding. He had had stools streaked with red blood for four days, was in good
      general condition, and was apyretic. Blood count, C-reactive protein, stool
      bacteriology and virology, abdominal X-ray examination, and abdominal ultrasounds
      did not reveal any abnormality. Cow's milk protein allergy was suggested despite 
      the negativity of specific immunoglobulins E (IgE) and a diet excluding cow's
      milk protein was initiated in the mother. In a context of persistent rectal
      bleeding and good general condition, an endoscopic examination found diffuse
      hemorrhagic colitis and an erythematous aspect of the fundus. CMV was revealed by
      histological examination (typical cytopathic effect and immunostaining) and high 
      viral load in the blood. The patient's immune balance was normal and the mother
      did not have any form of CMV infection. The diagnosis of primary CMV infection
      was retained in this immunocompetent child. Rectal bleeding disappeared without
      specific antiviral treatment. This observation points out that with rectal
      bleeding in an infant, cow's milk protein allergy should not be the only cause
      considered.

AB  - Due to the intestinal inflammation, tissue damage, and painful abdominal symptoms
      restricting dietary intake associated with both diseases, patients with
      intestinal pelvic radiation disease (PRD) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are
      at increased risk to develop protein calorie malnutrition and micronutrient
      deficiencies. In the current paper, we review the nutritional management of both 
      diseases, listing the similar approaches of nutritional management and the
      nutritional implications of intestinal dysfunction of both diseases. Malnutrition
      is prevalent in patients with either disease and nutritional risk screening and
      assessment of nutritional status are required for designing the proper
      nutritional intervention plan. This plan may include dietary management, oral
      nutritional supplementation, and enteral and/or parenteral nutrition. In addition
      to managing malnutrition, nutrients exert immune modulating effects during
      periods of intestinal inflammation and can play a role in mitigating the risks
      associated with the disease activity. Consistently, exclusive enteral feeding is 
      recommended for inducing remission in pediatric patients with active Crohn's
      disease, with less clear guidelines on use in patients with ulcerative colitis.
      The field of immune modulating nutrition is an evolving science that takes into
      consideration the specific mechanism of action of nutrients, nutrient-nutrient
      interaction, and preexisting nutritional status of the patients.

TI  - Increased IgA glycoprotein-2 specific antibody titres in refractory celiac
      disease.
PG  - 127-33
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: In most cases celiac disease (CD) is successfully treated with
      a gluten-free diet (GFD). However, some patients become refractory to the GFD.
      Refractory CD (RCD) patients have an increased risk for developing enteropathy
      associated T-cell lymphoma and early diagnosis is therefore of importance.
      Currently, RCD diagnosis relies on endoscopy and adequate serological markers are
      lacking. Antibodies against glycoprotein-2 (GP2A) were described in Crohn's
      disease (CrD) and active CD but not in ulcerative colitis (UC), suggesting this
      is a specific marker for small intestinal lesions. METHODS: Sera obtained from
      patients visiting our outpatient clinic for routine serological tests for
      diagnosis and/or follow-up of inflammatory bowel disease (n=78), active CD
      (n=45), GFD (n=34) and RCD (n=15) were analysed for GP2A titres. RESULTS:
      Increased GP2A-IgA levels in CrD and active CD as compared to controls (p<0.001) 
      and lack thereof in UC was confirmed. However, we could not confirm the
      association with small bowel localization within the CrD patient group. Within CD
      patients, we demonstrated a significant decrease of GP2A-IgA titres upon a GFD
      and increased levels in RCD patients as compared to patients on a GFD. Although
      GP2A-IgA was not associated with the degree of villous atrophy, GP2A-IgA levels
      were able to distinguish RCD patients from GFD patients (ROC AUC=0.79, p=0.002). 
      CONCLUSION: Follow-up of GP2A-IgA titres in CD patients on a GFD may help to
      identify patients at risk for developing RCD.

TI  - A prospective, randomized, controlled, exploratory study of comprehensive dietary
      advice in ulcerative colitis: impact on disease activity and quality of life.
PG  - 910-7
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0000000000000127 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The impact of food on relapse in ulcerative colitis has not been
      clearly defined. The aim of this prospective, randomized-controlled study was to 
      evaluate the impact of comprehensive dietary guidelines on the clinical course of
      the disease and quality of life in patients with ulcerative colitis. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: Patients were allocated randomly to an intervention or a control
      group. Participants in the intervention group were provided dietary guidelines in
      the form of an educational booklet that was recommended for use for 4-6 weeks
      during disease flare, that patients eat little and often (four to six times a
      day), drink adequate fluids, decrease excess intake of fat, decrease simple
      carbohydrates and decrease high-fibre foods during flare.Validated and
      study-designed questionnaires were used to compare patients' perceived quality of
      life, colitis activity scores and eating habits before and following the dietary 
      advice provided. RESULTS: Overall, 112 patients completed the study. Study
      participants were asked to complete the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire 
      and Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index together with the Food Frequency
      Questionnaire at 0, 6 and 24 weeks. At 24 weeks, there was a mean reduction in
      the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index score in the intervention group
      compared with an increase in the score in the control group [-1.304 (P=0.0108)
      vs. 0.875 (P=0.0249)]. There was a mean increase in the Inflammatory Bowel
      Disease Questionnaire score in the intervention group compared with a reduction
      in the score in the control group [7.17 (P=0.126) vs. -3.44 (P=0.205)]. A total
      of 69% of patients in the intervention group found the dietary advice
      significantly or moderately helpful. CONCLUSION: The study suggests that there is
      likely to be a link between the dietary advice provided and symptomatic
      improvement. The effect of diet may not occur through the addition or the
      elimination of single nutrients; rather, each food consumed combines many
      nutrients that allow for a synergistic or an antagonistic action when present in 
      a certain composition.

TI  - Variable access to quality nutrition information regarding inflammatory bowel
      disease: a survey of patients and health professionals and objective examination 
      of written information.
PG  - 2501-12
LID - 10.1111/hex.12219 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) report a range of
      nutritional and dietary problems and high-quality written information should be
      available on these. There is little research investigating the availability and
      quality of such information for patients with IBD. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed
      the type and quality of written information on nutrition and diet available to
      patients with IBD and the opinions of patients and health professionals. SETTING 
      AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-two patients with IBD were recruited from a large
      gastroenterology outpatient centre in England. One hundred dietitians from across
      the United Kingdom were also recruited. METHODS: Face-to-face surveys were
      conducted with patients with IBD. Questions regarding the use, format and
      usefulness of dietary information received were probed. Dietitians were surveyed 
      regarding written dietary information used in clinical practice. Samples of
      IBD-specific dietary information used across the UK were objectively assessed
      using two validated tools. MAIN RESULTS: The majority of patients rated written
      information as 'good' or 'very good', with the most useful information relating
      to 'general diet and IBD'. Forty-nine (49%) dietitians reported gaps in written
      information available for patients with IBD. Fifty-three different samples of
      IBD-specific information sheets were returned, with widely variable objective
      quality ratings. Commercially produced written information scored greater than
      locally produced information (BMA tool, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patient access to
      high-quality, written, IBD-specific dietary information is variable. IBD-specific

AB  - The epidemiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is changing globally.
      Incidence and prevalence may have stabilized in high-incidence areas such as
      North America and Europe but they continue to rise in previously low-incidence
      areas such as Eastern Europe, Asia, and much of the developing world. This
      epidemiological shift likely relates to westernization of lifestyle, changes in
      diet, and improved hygiene as part of socioeconomic development in developing
      countries. In Asia, UC is more prevalent than CD, although the UC:CD ratio is
      narrowing in certain areas. Clinical manifestations of IBD in Asia resemble the
      Western population, but with some differences, including higher prevalence of
      males and ileo-colonic CD, less familial clustering, lower surgical rates and
      extra-intestinal manifestations. These differences may relate to time, genetics
      and environmental factors. Studying the epidemiology of IBD in an area of rapidly
      increasing incidence may lead to discovery of important etiologic factors
      associated with disease development.

AB  - Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine that exerts either proinflammatory
      or anti-inflammatory effects and is implicated in diverse settings, including
      obesity, exercise, arthritis, and colitis. A new study shows that modulation of
      macrophage activation by IL-6 maintains glucose homeostasis in diet-induced
      obesity while limiting inflammation in endotoxemia (Mauer et al., 2014).

LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000077 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Maintaining a gluten-free diet (GFD) without an underlying diagnosis 
      of celiac disease has enjoyed widespread acceptance in the Unites States.
      METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study using a GFD questionnaire in 1647
      patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) participating in the CCFA
      Partners longitudinal Internet-based cohort. RESULTS: A diagnosis of celiac
      disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity were reported by 10 (0.6%) and 81
      (4.9%) respondents, respectively. Three hundred fourteen (19.1%) participants
      reported having previously tried a GFD and 135 (8.2%) reported current use of
      GFD. Overall 65.6% of all patients, who attempted a GFD, described an improvement
      of their gastrointestinal symptoms and 38.3% reported fewer or less severe IBD
      flares. In patients currently attempting a GFD, excellent adherence was
      associated with significant improvement of fatigue (P < 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: In
      this large group of patients with IBD, a substantial number had attempted a GFD, 
      of whom the majority had some form of improvement in gastrointestinal symptoms.
      Testing a GFD in clinical practice in patients with significant intestinal
      symptoms, which are not solely explained by the degree of intestinal
      inflammation, has the potential to be a safe and highly efficient therapeutic
      approach. Further prospective studies into mechanisms of gluten sensitivity in
      IBD are warranted.

LID - 10.1007/s11657-014-0177-0 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Osteomalacia is a metabolic bone disorder characterized by impaired
      mineralization of the bone matrix. Vitamin D deficiency due to malabsorption
      syndromes may cause osteomalacia. This is a case of a patient with a 6-year
      history of seronegative spondyloarthropathy associated with Crohn's disease who
      was admitted to our outpatient clinic with symptoms of osteomalacia.
      INTRODUCTION: Osteomalacia is a metabolic bone disease characterized by an
      impaired mineralization of the bone matrix, frequently caused by disorders in
      vitamin D or phosphate metabolism. Vitamin D deficiency due to malabsorption
      syndromes (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, and
      jejuno-ileal bypass for obesity) may cause osteomalacia. CASE REPORT: A
      43-year-old male presented with fatigue, low back pain, and morning stiffness. He
      had a 6-year history of seronegative spondyloarthropathy associated with Crohn's 
      disease. Laboratory findings revealed low serum calcium, low 25-hydroxy vitamin
      D3, normal phosphorus, elevated parathyroid hormone, and alkaline phosphatase
      levels. Radiographs revealed grade IV sacroiliitis and Looser zones. He was
      diagnosed with osteomalacia due to the malabsorption of vitamin D. His symptoms
      and signs were relieved with supplements of vitamin D and calcium. CONCLUSIONS:
      Osteomalacia should be considered in differential diagnosis when assessing low
      back pain in the patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Vitamin D
      deficiency should be treated with vitamin D supplementation in patients with
      Crohn's disease to prevent osteomalacia.

TI  - Treatment of abdominal pain in irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 1193-205
LID - 10.1007/s00535-014-0966-7 [doi]
AB  - Functional abdominal pain in the context of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a
      challenging problem for primary care physicians, gastroenterologists and pain
      specialists. We review the evidence for the current and future
      non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment options targeting the central
      nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. Cognitive interventions such as
      cognitive behavioral therapy and hypnotherapy have demonstrated excellent results
      in IBS patients, but the limited availability and labor-intensive nature limit
      their routine use in daily practice. In patients who are refractory to first-line
      therapy, tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) and selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors are both effective to obtain symptomatic relief, but only TCAs have
      been shown to improve abdominal pain in meta-analyses. A diet low in fermentable 
      carbohydrates and polyols (FODMAP) seems effective in subgroups of patients to
      reduce abdominal pain, bloating, and to improve the stool pattern. The evidence
      for fiber is limited and only isphagula may be somewhat beneficial. The efficacy 
      of probiotics is difficult to interpret since several strains in different
      quantities have been used across studies. Antispasmodics, including peppermint
      oil, are still considered the first-line treatment for abdominal pain in IBS.
      Second-line therapies for diarrhea-predominant IBS include the non-absorbable
      antibiotic rifaximin and the 5HT3 antagonists alosetron and ramosetron, although 
      the use of the former is restricted because of the rare risk of ischemic colitis.
      In laxative-resistant, constipation-predominant IBS, the chloride-secretion
      stimulating drugs lubiprostone and linaclotide, a guanylate cyclase C agonist
      that also has direct analgesic effects, reduce abdominal pain and improve the
      stool pattern.

AB  - In recent years, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying colorectal
      carcinogenesis has vastly expanded. Underlying inflammation within the intestine,
      diet, and most recently, the gut microbiota, have been demonstrated to influence 
      the development of colorectal cancer. However, since cancer is ultimately a
      genetic disease, these factors are thought to create genotoxic stress within the 
      intestinal environment to promote genetic and epigenetic alterations leading to
      cancer. In this review, we will focus on how gut microbes intersect with
      inflammation, diet, and host genetics to influence the development of colon
      cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin D, an important modulator of the immune system, has been
      shown to protect mucosal barrier homeostasis. This study investigates the effects
      of vitamin D deficiency on infection-induced changes in intestinal epithelial
      barrier function in vitro and on Citrobacter rodentium-induced colitis in mice.
      METHODS: Polarized epithelial Caco2-bbe cells were grown in medium with or
      without vitamin D and challenged with enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.
      Barrier function and tight junction protein expression were assessed. Weaned
      C57BL/6 mice were fed either a vitamin D-sufficient or vitamin D-deficient diet
      and then infected with C. rodentium. Disease severity was assessed by
      histological analysis, intestinal permeability assay, measurement of inflammatory
      cytokine levels, and microbiome analysis. RESULTS: 1,25(OH)2D3 altered E. coli
      O157:H7-induced reductions in transepithelial electrical resistance (P < .01),
      decreased permeability (P < .05), and preserved barrier integrity. Vitamin
      D-deficient mice challenged with C. rodentium demonstrated increased colonic
      hyperplasia and epithelial barrier dysfunction (P < .0001 and P < .05,
      respectively). Vitamin D deficiency resulted in an altered composition of the
      fecal microbiome both in the absence and presence of C. rodentium infection.
      CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that vitamin D is an important mediator of
      intestinal epithelial defenses against infectious agents. Vitamin D deficiency
      predisposes to more-severe intestinal injury in an infectious model of colitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Clinical management of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD),
      new treatment modalities and the potential impact of personalised medicine remain
      topics of intense interest as our understanding of the pathophysiology of IBD
      expands. METHODS: Potential future strategies for IBD management are discussed,
      based on recent preclinical and clinical research. RESULTS: A top-down approach
      to medical therapy is increasingly being adopted for patients with risk factors
      for severe inflammation or an unfavourable disease course in an attempt to halt
      the inflammatory process as early as possible, prevent complications and induce
      mucosal healing. In the future, biological therapies for IBD are likely to be
      used more selectively based on personalised benefit/risk assessment, determined
      through reliable biomarkers and tissue signatures, and will probably be optimised
      throughout the course of treatment. Biologics with different mechanisms of action
      will be available; when one drug fails, patients will be able to switch to
      another and even combination biologics may become a reality. The role of
      biotherapeutic products that are similar to currently licensed biologics in terms
      of quality, safety and efficacy - i.e. biosimilars - is at an early stage and
      requires further experience. Other therapeutic strategies may involve
      manipulation of the microbiome using antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, diet
      and combinations of all these approaches. Faecal microbiota transplantation is
      also a potential option in IBD although controlled data are lacking. CONCLUSIONS:
      The future of classifying, prognosticating and managing IBD involves an
      outcomes-based approach to identify biomarkers reflecting various biological
      processes that can be matched with clinically important endpoints.

AB  - This is a consensus of the Austrian working group of IBD (inflammatory bowel
      diseases) of the OGGH on nutrition in IBD. Malnutrition should be assessed in
      case of IBD (in 20 - 70 % of Crohn's patients) and weight loss(> 5 % within 3
      months) or nutritional deficiencies or after extensive bowel resection and
      afterwards also treated. Malnutrition should be treated with medical therapy of
      IBD and also adequate - as far as possible - with oral nutritional therapy
      particularly because of reduced life quality, risk of opportunistic infections,
      osteopenia/osteoporosis, longer hospitalisations and higher mortality. Iron
      homeostasis, serum levels of Vitamin B12- and folic acid, 25-hydroxyvitamin D and
      zinc should be checked. Therapy with enteral liquid diets is only indicated as
      therapy of first choice in children and adolescents, but only in rare situations 
      in adults with IBD. There is - up to now - no proven oral diet for maintenance of
      remission in IBD. Probiotics as E. coli Nissle could be used as alternative to
      mesalazine for maintenance of remission in patients with ulcerative colitis. A
      specific dietary counselling is mandatory in patients with ileostoma or short
      bowel syndrome. Malnutrition of short bowel patients is particularly dependent on
      the function and length of the remaining bowel, therefore the most effective
      medical therapy should be administered.

PG  - 1110-9
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000020 [doi]
AB  - Inadequate dietary intake of the essential trace element selenium (Se) is thought
      to be a risk factor for several chronic diseases associated with oxidative stress
      and inflammation. Biological actions of Se occur through low-molecular weight
      metabolites and through selenoproteins. Several key selenoproteins including
      glutathione peroxidases; selenoproteins M, P, and S; and selenium-binding protein
      1 have been detected in the intestine. Interestingly, Se and antioxidant
      selenoproteins are known to modulate differentiation and function of immune cells
      and contribute to avoid excessive immune responses. This review discusses the
      role of Se and intestinal selenoproteins in inflammatory bowel diseases, based on
      data from human, animal, and in vitro studies. In humans, Se deficiency is
      commonly observed in patients with Crohn's disease. In animal models of
      experimental colitis, the Se status was negatively correlated with the severity
      of the disease. While the cause-effect relationship of these observations remains
      to be clarified, the beneficial outcome of dietary Se supplementation and an
      optimization of selenoprotein biosynthesis in murine inflammatory bowel disease
      models have led to investigations of targets and actions of Se in the
      gastrointestinal tract. The Se status affects gene expression, signaling
      pathways, and cellular functions in the small and large intestine as well as the 
      gut microbiome composition. This data, particularly from animal experiments, hold
      promise that adequate dietary Se supply may counteract chronic intestinal
      inflammation in humans.

AB  - Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is an emerging disorder characterized by
      intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms related to the ingestion of
      gluten-containing food in non-celiac patients. Its prevalence has been estimated 
      to be six to ten-times higher than that of celiac disease (CD). A gluten-free
      diet is the most widely recommended therapy, but the causative agent remains
      unknown and there are no consensus diagnostic criteria. Recent studies on NCGS
      have included patients with possibly overlooked minor CD and diarrhea-predominant
      irritable bowel syndrome without self-reported gluten intolerance, but showing a 
      response to a gluten-free diet. Furthermore, FODMAPs (Fermentable
      Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides And Polyols) have recently been 
      postulated as the culprit component for NCGS in wheat, instead of gluten. This
      review updates evidence on the pathophysiology of NCGS and the efficacy of
      different dietary interventions in its treatment, stressing the need for proper
      screening for CD before a diagnosis of NCGS is made.

      tumorigenesis through inducing Nrf2 signaling pathway and inhibition of
      inflammation.

LID - 10.1186/1476-4598-13-48 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) has emerged as a
      novel target for the prevention of colorectal cancer (CRC). Many chemopreventive 
      compounds associated with Nrf2 activation are effective in preclinical systems
      and many on-going clinical trials are showing promising findings. In present
      study we evaluated the cytoprotective effect and chemopreventive properties of
      dietary digitoflavone. METHOD: A cell based Antioxidant Response Element
      (ARE)-driven luciferase reporter system was applied to screen potential Nrf2
      activators. Activation of Nrf2 by digitoflavone was confirmed through mRNA,
      protein and GSH level assay in Caco-2 cell line. The cytoprotective effect of
      digitoflavone was evaluated in H2O2-induced oxidative stress model and further
      signaling pathways analysis was used to determine the target of digitoflavone
      induced Nrf2 activation. An AOM-DSS induced colorectal cancer model was used to
      assess the chemopreventive effect of digitoflavone. RESULT: Micromolarity (10
      muM) level of digitoflavone increased Nrf2 expressing, nuclear translocation and 
      expression of downstream phase II antioxidant enzymes. Furthermore, digitoflavone
      decreased H2O2-induced oxidative stress and cell death via p38 MAPK-Nrf2/ARE
      pathway. In vivo study, 50 mg/kg digitoflavone significantly reduced AOM-DSS
      induced tumor incidence, number and size. CONCLUSION: These observations suggest 
      that digitoflavone is a novel Nrf2 pathway activator, and protects against
      oxidative stress-induced cell injury. The results of the present study add
      further evidence of the molecular mechanisms that allow digitoflavone to exert
      protective effects and reaffirm its potential role as a chemopreventive agent in 
      colorectal carcinogenesis.

AB  - The evolving understanding of the role of the microbiome and environmental
      factors in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease makes diet an
      interesting and potentially powerful tool in the treatment of disease. However,
      at this time, evidence is limited but anecdotal reports of success abound. There 
      is a bewildering array of new diets being tried by patients in an attempt to
      control diseases. This review attempts to summarize the most common diets for the
      treating physician.

TI  - Restriction of dairy products; a reality in inflammatory bowel disease patients.
PG  - 575-81
LID - 10.3305/nh.2014.29.3.7124 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Calcium deficiency is considered a risk factor for the development 
      of osteoporosis in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Various dietary
      restrictions, including milk products are reported by these patients. OBJECTIVE: 
      To evaluate dairy product and dietary calcium intake by IBD patients. METHODS:
      This cross-sectional study enrolled 65 outpatients with IBD recruited from one
      reference center for IBD. A semi-structured questionnaire (to collect
      demographic, socioeconomic and clinical data) and a quantitative food frequency
      questionnaire were administered. With regard to clinical data, we evaluated the
      anthropometric nutritional status, the disease classification, the disease
      activity index and the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Self-reported
      modifications in the use of dairy products were evaluated. RESULTS: The IBD
      patients' ages ranged from 20-75 years and 67.0% were diagnosed with ulcerative
      colitis. The majority (64.7%) reported restricting dairy products. The frequency 
      of gastrointestinal symptoms was higher among the Crohn's disease patients who
      restricted dairy products than among those with no restrictions (100% vs 42.9%; p
      = 0.013); this result was not observed among the UC (ulcerative colitis)
      patients. Disease activity was also more frequent in the IBD patients who
      restricted dairy products than in those with no restrictions (23.8% vs 4.5%; p = 
      0.031), and among the UC patients, extensive disease was more common in the
      patients who restricted dairy products than in those with no restrictions (42.9% 
      vs 20.0%; p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Restricting dairy products is common among IBD
      patients, possibly due to disease activity, the presence of gastrointestinal
      symptoms and the extension of the disease.

AB  - The global prevalence of Fe deficiency is high and a common corrective strategy
      is oral Fe supplementation, which may affect the commensal gut microbiota and
      gastrointestinal health. The aim of the present study was to investigate the
      impact of different dietary Fe concentrations on the gut microbiota and gut
      health of rats inoculated with human faecal microbiota. Rats (8 weeks old, n 40) 
      were divided into five (n 8 each) groups and fed diets differing only in Fe
      concentration during an Fe-depletion period (12 weeks) and an Fe-repletion period
      (4 weeks) as follows: (1) Fe-sufficient diet throughout the study period; (2)
      Fe-sufficient diet followed by 70 mg Fe/kg diet; (3) Fe-depleted diet throughout 
      the study period; (4) Fe-depleted diet followed by 35 mg Fe/kg diet; (5)
      Fe-depleted diet followed by 70 mg Fe/kg diet. Faecal and caecal samples were
      analysed for gut microbiota composition (quantitative PCR and pyrosequencing) and
      bacterial metabolites (HPLC), and intestinal tissue samples were investigated
      histologically. Fe depletion did not significantly alter dominant populations of 
      the gut microbiota and did not induce Fe-deficiency anaemia in the studied rats. 
      Provision of the 35 mg Fe/kg diet after feeding an Fe-deficient diet
      significantly increased the abundance of dominant bacterial groups such as
      Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium cluster IV members compared with that of an
      Fe-deficient diet. Fe supplementation increased gut microbial butyrate
      concentration 6-fold compared with Fe depletion and did not affect histological
      colitis scores. The present results suggest that Fe supplementation enhances the 
      concentration of beneficial gut microbiota metabolites and thus may contribute to
      gut health.

TI  - Identification of a probiotic bacteria-derived activator of the aryl hydrocarbon 
      receptor that inhibits colitis.
PG  - 460-5
LID - 10.1038/icb.2014.2 [doi]
AB  - The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) recognizes environmental xenobiotics and is
      originally thought to be involved in the metabolism (detoxification) of the
      substances. Recently, AhR is highlighted as an important regulator of
      inflammation. Notably, accumulating evidence suggests that activation of the AhR 
      suppresses inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Therefore, non-toxic AhR
      activators become attractive drug candidates for IBD. This study identified
      1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (DHNA), a precursor of menaquinone (vitamin K2)
      abundantly produced by Propionibacterium freudenreichii ET-3 isolated from
      Swiss-type cheese, as an AhR activator. DHNA activated the AhR pathway in human
      intestinal epithelial cell line Caco2 cells and in the mouse intestine. Oral
      treatment of mice with DHNA induced anti-microbial proteins RegIIIbeta and gamma 
      in the intestine, altered intestinal microbial flora and inhibited dextran sodium
      sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis, which recapitulated the phenotypes of AhR
      activation in the gut. As DHNA is commercially available in Japan as a prebiotic 
      supplement without severe adverse effects, DHNA or its derivatives might become a
      promising drug candidate for IBD via AhR activation. The results also implicate
      that intestinal AhR might act not only as a sensor for xenobiotics in diet and
      water but also for commensal bacterial activity because DHNA is a precursor of
      vitamin K2 produced by vitamin K2-synthesizing commensal bacteria as well as
      propionic bacteria. Hence, DHNA might be a key bacterial metabolite in the
      host-microbe interaction to maintain intestinal microbial ecosystem.

AB  - This study was conducted to investigate serum amino acids profile in dextran
      sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, and impacts of graded dose of arginine or
      glutamine supplementation on the colitis. Using DSS-induced colitis model, which 
      is similar to human ulcerative colitis, we determined serum profile of amino
      acids at day 3, 7, 10 and 12 (5 days post DSS treatment). Meanwhile, effects of
      graded dose of arginine (0.4%, 0.8%, and 1.5%) or glutamine (0.5%, 1.0% and 2.0%)
      supplementation on clinical parameters, serum amino acids, colonic tight junction
      proteins, colonic anti-oxidative indicators [catalase, total superoxide dismutase
      (T-SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px)], colonic pro-inflammatory cytokines
      [interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, IL-17 and tumor necrosis factor alpha
      (TNF-alpha)] in DSS-induced colitis were fully analyzed at day 7 and 12.
      Additionally, the activation of signal transduction pathways, including nuclear
      factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK),
      phosphoinositide-3-kinases (PI3K)/PI3K-protein kinase B (Akt), and myosin light
      chain kinase (MLCK)-myosin light chain (MLC20), were analyzed using
      immunoblotting. Serum amino acids analysis showed that DSS treatment changed the 
      serum contents of amino acids, such as Trp, Glu, and Gln (P<0.05). Dietary
      arginine or glutamine supplementation had significant (P<0.05) influence on the
      clinical and biochemical parameters (T-SOD, IL-17 and TNF-alpha) in colitis
      model. These results were associated with colonic NF-kappaB, PI3K-Akt and MLCK
      signaling pathways. In conclusion, arginine or glutamine could be a potential
      therapy for intestinal inflammatory diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Inorganic nitrate and nitrite have emerged as alternative substrates 
      for nitric oxide (NO) generation in the gastrointestinal tract, and have shown to
      be protective against drug-induced gastric injury. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the preventive and therapeutic effects of nitrate and nitrite in a
      model of experimental colitis. METHODS: Colitis was induced in mice by
      administrating dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) with concurrent administration of
      nitrite (1 mM) or nitrate (10 mM) in the drinking water for 7 days. A therapeutic
      approach was also investigated by initiating nitrite treatment 3 days after
      DSS-induced colitis. Clinical and inflammatory markers were assessed and the
      colonic mucus thickness was measured in vivo. The effect of nitrite on wound
      healing was evaluated using colon epithelial cells. RESULTS: Concurrent
      administration of DSS and nitrite (1 mM) alleviated inflammation as determined by
      reduced disease activity index score (DAI) and increased colon length, while
      nitrate (10 mM) only reduced the DAI-score. Nitrite also displayed therapeutic
      effects by ameliorating established colonic inflammation with reduced colonic
      expression of iNOS and improving histopathology. DSS-induced decrease in colonic 
      mucus thickness was completely prevented by nitrite administration. In addition, 
      goblet cell abundance was lower by DSS treatment, but was increased by addition
      of nitrite. Further studies using colon epithelial cells revealed an NO-dependent
      improvement in wound healing with nitrite administration. CONCLUSION: Nitrite
      exerts both preventive and therapeutic effects in colonic inflammation. The
      protective effects involve preservation of an intact adherent mucus layer and
      regulation of epithelial cell restitution.

TI  - Probiotic treatments for induction and maintenance of remission in inflammatory
      bowel diseases: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
PG  - 1-13
LID - 10.1007/s12328-013-0440-8 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics have been used for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).
      However, the effects of probiotics on the induction and maintenance of remission 
      in ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) still remain controversial.
      This systematic review verified the findings of high-quality randomized
      controlled trials (RCTs) which investigated the therapeutic effects of probiotics
      on IBD. After the quality assessment, 20 RCTs which investigated the effects of
      probiotics on the induction or maintenance of remission in IBD were identified.
      From the results of the validation of these RCTs, beneficial effects of probiotic
      treatments to improve the response rate and remission rate on the remission
      induction therapies [risk ratio (RR) 1.81; 95 % confidence interval (CI)
      1.40-2.35 and RR 1.56; 95 % CI 0.95-2.56, respectively] were verified.
      Furthermore, probiotic treatments exhibited effects equal to mesalazine on the
      maintenance of remission in UC (RR 1.00; 95 % CI 0.79-1.26). In contrast, no
      significant effect of probiotic treatments was shown in either the induction or
      maintenance of remission in CD. Because there were many variations in the
      conditions among these studies, a further analysis evaluating the effects of
      probiotic treatments in IBD is needed to clarify the optimal probiotics and
      treatment regimens for each condition or population in IBD patients.

      microscopic colitis compared to controls.
PG  - 16
LID - 10.1186/1472-6874-14-16 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microscopic colitis (MC) induces gastrointestinal symptoms, which are
      partly overlapping with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), predominately in
      middle-aged and elderly women. The etiology is unknown, but association with
      smoking has been found. The aim of this study was to examine whether the
      increased risk for smokers to develop MC is a true association, or rather the
      result of confounding factors. Therefore, patients suffering from MC and
      population-based controls from the same geographic area were studied regarding
      smoking- and alcohol habits, and other simultaneous, lifestyle factors,
      concerning the clinical expression of the disease. METHODS: Women at the age of
      73 years or younger, who had been treated for biopsy-verified MC at any of the
      Departments of Gastroenterology in Skane, between 2002 and 2010, were invited to 
      the study (240 patients). Women (737) from the population-based prospective
      cohort study, Malmo Diet and Cancer Study (MDCS), served as controls. A
      self-administered questionnaire about lifestyle factors, gastrointestinal
      symptoms, medical conditions and medication at the time for the study was sent by
      post. RESULTS: Altogether, 131 women with MC could be included after age-matching
      with controls (median age 56 years) and exclusion of secondary MC. Patients were 
      divided into persistent MC (MC1) and transient MC (MC2). Past smoking was
      associated with increased risk to develop MC2 (OR = 2.67, 95 CI = 1.15-6.23),
      whereas current smoking was associated with increased risk to develop MC1 (OR =
      3.18, 95 CI = 1.57-6.42). Concomitant symptoms of IBS were associated with
      smoking (OR = 4.24, 95 CI = 1.92-9.32). Alcohol drinking had no association with 
      MC or IBS. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that past smoking is associated with 
      transient MC, whereas current smoking is associated with persistent MC. Smoking
      is associated with MC patients with concomitant IBS-like symptoms.

PG  - 63-6
AB  - The arm of this review was to help general pediatricians and primary care
      physicians in diagnosing and managing cow's milk protein allergy in exclusively
      breast-fed infants. Allergic proctocolitis is a cause of rectal bleeding in
      exclusively breast-fed infants aged from 1 to 6 months.It is due to cow's milk
      protein transferred via breast milk. Diagnosis is based on clinical features and 
      recovery after dietetic therapy. Rectal bleeding generally resolves within 72-96 
      hours of cow's milk protein maternal avoidance. Most infants tolerate cow's milk 
      by their first birthday.

TI  - Fiber in the treatment and maintenance of inflammatory bowel disease: a
      systematic review of randomized controlled trials.
PG  - 576-86
LID - 10.1097/01.MIB.0000437984.92565.31 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dietary fiber may favorably influence fermentation, gastrointestinal 
      inflammation, and disease progression in Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis
      (UC), and pouchitis and offer an attractive therapeutic addition to
      pharmacological treatment. This systematic review appraised data from randomized 
      controlled trials of fiber in the management of inflammatory bowel disease.
      METHODS: The review followed Cochrane and PRISMA recommendations. Seven
      electronic databases were searched along with hand searching and contacting
      experts. Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials of the effects of
      fiber on clinical endpoints (primarily disease activity for treatment or
      maintenance) or physiological outcomes in patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease. RESULTS: In total, 23 randomized controlled trials fulfilled the
      inclusion criteria (UC, 10; Crohn's disease, 12; and pouchitis, 1) recruiting
      1296 patients. In UC, 3/10 studies reported fiber supplementation to benefit
      disease outcomes. In Crohn's disease, 0/12 studies and in pouchitis 1/1 study
      reported a benefit on disease activity. Despite this, a number of studies
      reported favorable intragroup effects on physiological outcomes including fecal
      butyrate, fecal calprotectin, inflammatory cytokines, microbiota, and
      gastrointestinal symptom indices. Meta-analysis was not possible. CONCLUSIONS:
      There is limited weak evidence for the efficacy of fiber in improving disease
      outcomes in UC and pouchitis. The potential antiinflammatory role of fiber is
      intriguing and merits further investigation in adequately powered clinical
      trials. Excluding overt gastrointestinal obstruction, there was no evidence that 
      fiber intake should be restricted in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Detailed assessment of nutritional status and eating patterns in children with
      gastrointestinal diseases attending an outpatients clinic and contemporary
      healthy controls.
PG  - 700-6

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: In the era of modern multidisciplinary clinical
      management, very little is known about the prevalence and presentation of
      malnutrition in children with gastrointestinal disorders (GastroD) particularly
      employing composite, global measures of nutritional status. SUBJECTS/METHODS:
      Anthropometry, body composition, dietary intake, eating habits and grip strength 
      were assessed with bedside methods in 168 patients from outpatient
      gastroenterology clinics (n, median (IQR) years; Crohn's disease (CD): n=53, 14.2
      (11.6:15.4); ulcerative colitis (UC): n=27, 12.2 (10.7:14.2); coeliac disease:
      n=31, 9.3 (7.5:13.6); other GastroD: n=57, 9.8 (7.2:13.8)) and compared with 62
      contemporary healthy controls (n, median (IQR): 9.8 (6.9:13.8)) and the results
      of the recent UK, National Diet and Nutritional Survey (NDNS). RESULTS: Children 
      with CD had lower BMI z-scores than controls (median (IQR): -0.3 (-0.9:0.4) vs
      0.3 (-0.6:1.4); P=0.02) but only 2% were classified as thin (BMI z-score <-2
      s.d.). The prevalence of obesity in children with UC was 19%, 6% in CD, 11% in
      children with other GastroD and 15% in controls. No difference was found in grip 
      strength measurement between groups. Except for CD children, the proportion of
      patients with suboptimal micronutrient intake was similar to that of controls and
      the cohort of children from the latest NDNS. A higher proportion of children with
      CD had suboptimal intake for riboflavin, vitamin B6 and calcium and consumed
      significantly more meat products, juices (including carbonated drinks),
      spreads/jams and crisps and savoury snacks and significantly fewer portions of
      dairy, fish, fruits and vegetables compared with healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS:
      GastroD affect children's body composition, growth, strength, dietary intake and 
      eating habits, particularly CD, but to a lesser extent than expected.

TI  - Impact of complementary and alternative medicine on the quality of life in
      inflammatory bowel disease: results from a French national survey.
PG  - 288-94
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0000000000000040 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) are widely used by
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Few data have been published on
      the impact of CAM on the quality of life (QOL). AIMS: The aim of the study was to
      describe CAM use in French patients with IBD, identify characteristics associated
      with CAM use, and assess the impact of CAM on the QOL. METHODS: We conducted an
      internet survey on CAM through the French IBD patient's association website.
      Patients had to answer a questionnaire (LimeSurvey application) about
      sociodemography, IBD treatment, CAM type, socioeconomic data, and QOL using the
      Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ). Patients noted the impact of CAM on their
      symptoms and on their QOL on a scale of 0-100. CAM users and nonusers were
      compared by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: A total of 936 IBD
      patients responded and 767 (82.4%) filled up the whole questionnaire: 503
      reported CAM use and 172 had never used. The types of CAM reported were
      diet-based (30.7%), body-based (25.1%), homeopathic or traditional medicine
      (19.6%), naturopathy (15.2%), and mind-body medicine (9.1%). The
      gastroenterologist was aware of CAM use in only 46% of patients. CAM users were
      more likely to have ulcerative colitis [odds ratio (OR)=1.78, P=0.018], clinical 
      remission (OR=1.42, P=0.06), high level of education (OR=1.51, P=0.02), poor
      observance (OR=1.81, P=0.017), or to have terminated conventional treatment
      (OR=2.03, P=0.003). CAM users tend to have higher rates of SIBDQ scores, greater 
      than 50 (OR=1.57, P=0.06). Improvement in symptoms and QOL was reported with all 
      CAM types except mind medicine. CONCLUSION: CAM use is widespread among IBD
      patients. CAM users report improvement in symptoms and QOL, but they tend to stop
      their conventional treatment. Better information about CAM might improve
      adherence to conventional treatment.

TI  - Patients' experience and perception of hospital-treated Clostridium difficile
      infections: a qualitative study.
PG  - 97-105
LID - 10.1007/s40271-013-0043-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile is the leading cause of antibiotic-associated
      diarrhea and an important source of nosocomial infection. Clinical manifestations
      can range from mild diarrhea to lethal pseudomembranous colitis. Little is known 
      about the burden of C. difficile infections (CDI) in patients. OBJECTIVE: This
      qualitative study explored the impact of hospital-treated CDI on patients' lives 
      from the first occurrence of CDI symptoms, through their hospital stay, and after
      discharge. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews with 12 US and 12 French patients 
      who had experienced CDI were conducted using an interview guide that was
      developed on the basis of a thorough literature review. Transcripts from these
      interviews were analyzed to identify concepts related to the research question.
      FINDINGS: CDI affected numerous aspects of patients' lives. Patients reported
      that the continuous, watery, and uncontrollable diarrhea characteristic of CDI
      had the most impact on their daily lives. Diarrhea prevented them from
      participating in usual daily activities; this caused the collapse of their social
      lives. Patients felt humiliated and embarrassed. Patients' emotional distress
      worsened once hospitalized; they reported feelings of loneliness and worry when
      placed in isolation. From discharge to the time of the interview, patients
      reported both psychological and physical improvement. However, despite continuing
      improvement, most patients reported persistent worry and fear of recurrent
      episodes, and they were thus more careful about their diet and hygiene.
      CONCLUSION: As one patient in this study explained, CDI is "the worst of
      everything that I've had." The emotional distress and extreme physical exhaustion
      associated with CDI result in a traumatic and frightening experience for
      patients. This trauma persists after recovery and includes lingering fears of a
      recurrent episode.

AB  - The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is rapidly increasing in developing
      countries, especially among populations that are adopting Western-style diets.
      Several, but not all, epidemiological and experimental studies suggest that a
      high intake of meat, especially red and processed meat, is associated with
      increased CRC risk. Potential reasons for the association between high red and
      processed meat intake and CRC risk include the content of the meat (e.g. protein,
      heme) and compounds generated by the cooking process (e.g. N-nitroso compounds,
      heterocyclic amines). These factors can affect the large intestine mucosa with
      genotoxicity and metabolic disturbances. Increased bacterial fermentation
      (putrefaction) of undigested protein and production of bacterial metabolites
      derived from amino acids may affect colon epithelial homeostasis and renewal.
      This correlates with the fact that most colonic cancers are detected in the
      distal colon and rectum where protein fermentation actively occurs. However,
      there are still large controversies on the relationship between red meat
      consumption and CRC risk. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to enhance the
      current understanding on the association between high red and processed meat
      intakes with CRC risk. A principal focus of this review will be to discuss the
      meat-related components, such as proteins in the meat, heme, N-nitroso compounds,
      and heterocyclic amines, and the effects they have upon the large intestine
      mucosa and the intestinal gut microbiota.

TI  - High residential sun exposure is associated with a low risk of incident Crohn's
      disease in the prospective E3N cohort.
PG  - 75-81

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin D insufficiency has been suggested to be associated with high
      risk of Crohn's disease (CD). In France, where food fortification is limited, the
      major source of vitamin D is through sun exposure. The aim of this work was to
      analyze the relationship between residential sun exposure and the risk of
      incident CD or ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: The E3N cohort consists of women
      living in France, aged 40 to 65 years and free of major diseases at inclusion in 
      1990. Among the 91,870 women included in the study, we identified 123 incident
      cases (45 CD, 71 UC, and 7 indeterminate colitis). To assess residential sun
      exposure, we used a database containing mean daily ultraviolet radiation (UVR)
      dose for each French county. The relationship between residential sun exposure
      and risk of incident inflammatory bowel diseases was explored using Cox models.
      RESULTS: Higher levels of residential sun exposure were associated with a
      significant decreased risk of CD (hazard ratio [HR] for the third versus the
      first tertile of UVR dose, 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.23-1.01; P for
      trend = 0.04), but not of UC (HR, 1.21; CI, 0.61-2.11). In women with available
      data on dietary vitamin D intake, we observed a lower risk of CD with higher
      residential UVR (HR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.11-0.80; P for trend = 0.01). Dietary
      vitamin D intake was neither associated with the risk of CD (HR, 0.41; 95% CI,
      0.14-1.24; P for trend = 0.14) nor UC (HR, 1.61; CI, 0.61-4.23). CONCLUSIONS: In 
      this prospective cohort of women, high residential sunlight exposure was
      associated with decreased incidence of CD, but not UC.

TI  - Treatment guidelines in inflammatory bowel disease: the Japanese perspectives.
PG  - 363-7
LID - 10.1159/000354696 [doi]
AB  - The number of inflammatory bowel disease patients has been increasing in Japan
      and the demand for clinical practical guidelines emerged. A set of clinical
      practice guidelines for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease were thus
      published in 2006 and 2011, respectively. Their English versions were then
      published in 2000 and 2012, respectively. These guidelines aim to provide
      appropriate clinical indicators to Japanese practitioners to improve the outcomes
      of inflammatory bowel disease patients. The guidelines are based on global
      literature-based evidence as well as evidence from Japan. The Japanese guidelines
      were developed based on the existing evidence with integration of the experts'
      consensus. The criteria for recommendation grade were also determined by the
      level of evidence as well as by the experts' consensus. It is a distinct feature 
      of the Japanese guidelines to disclose this process explicitly. This
      recommendation rating is thus useful to fill the gap between evidence and daily
      clinical practice. Since the Japanese guidelines are primarily based on global
      literature-based evidence, most of the clinical indicators in them are consistent
      with those in other guidelines from the Western world. Meanwhile, there are some 
      distinctly different statements in the Japanese guidelines reflecting Japanese
      standard clinical practice, evidence, and the opinions of Japanese experts.

TI  - Impact of ethnicity, geography, and disease on the microbiota in health and
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 2906-18
LID - 10.1097/01.MIB.0000435759.05577.12 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The gut microbiota is central to health and disorders such as
      inflammatory bowel disease. Differences in microbiota related to geography and
      ethnicity may hold the key to recent changes in the incidence of
      microbiota-related disorders. METHODS: Gut mucosal microbiota was analyzed in 190
      samples from 87 Caucasian and Chinese subjects, from Australia and Hong Kong,
      comprising 22 patients with Crohn's disease, 30 patients with ulcerative colitis,
      29 healthy controls, and 6 healthy relatives of patients with Crohn's disease.
      Bacterial 16S rRNA microarray and 454 pyrosequencing were performed. RESULTS: The
      microbiota was diverse in health, regardless of ethnicity or geography
      (operational taxonomic unit number and Shannon diversity index). Ethnicity and
      geography, however, did affect microbial composition. Crohn's disease resulted in
      reduced bacterial diversity, regardless of ethnicity or geography, and was the
      strongest determinant of composition. In ulcerative colitis, diversity was
      reduced in Chinese subjects only, suggesting that ethnicity is a determinant of
      bacterial diversity, whereas composition was determined by disease and ethnicity.
      Specific phylotypes were different between health and disease. Chinese patients
      with inflammatory bowel disease more often than healthy Chinese tended to have
      had a Western diet in childhood, in the East and West. CONCLUSION: The healthy
      microbiota is diverse but compositionally affected by geographical and ethnic
      factors. The microbiota is substantially altered in inflammatory bowel disease,
      but ethnicity may also play an important role. This may be key to the changing
      epidemiology in developing countries, and emigrants to the West.

TI  - The human microbiome and probiotics: implications for pediatrics.
PG  - 42-52
LID - 10.1159/000354899 [doi]
AB  - Steady advances in our knowledge of the composition and function of the human
      microbiome at multiple body sites including the gut, skin and airways will likely
      contribute to our understanding of mechanisms of probiotic action by beneficial
      microbes. Microbe:microbe and microbe:human interactions are important
      considerations as we select probiotics for pediatric patients in the future.
      Although our knowledge about the composition of the microbiome is progressing
      rapidly, many gaps exist about the functional capacity and metabolic machinery of
      the human microbiome. Based on a limited amount of data, probiotics appear
      capable of altering the composition and function of the microbiome. Probiotics
      may be part of dietary strategies that combine ways to enhance microbiome
      function with nutrients that may be converted to active compounds promoting human
      health. Probiotics have yielded beneficial effects in numerous studies in the
      context of different diseases in pediatric gastroenterology. These disease states
      include necrotizing enterocolitis, antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis,
      acute gastroenteritis and irritable bowel syndrome. In the skin and airways, it
      is unclear if probiotics can affect the function of the microbiome to reduce the 
      impact of diseases such as asthma and atopic dermatitis. An enhanced
      understanding of the effects of probiotics on the microbiome should facilitate
      selection of optimal probiotic strains for specific diseases in the future.

TI  - Dietary arachidonic and oleic acid intake in ulcerative colitis etiology: a
      prospective cohort study using 7-day food diaries.
PG  - 11-8
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0b013e328365c372 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dietary fatty acids may be involved in the etiology of ulcerative
      colitis (UC). Arachidonic acid (AA), an n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid, is a
      precursor of the proinflammatory cytokines prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4,
      and its metabolism is competitively inhibited by oleic acid (OA). This study
      aimed to prospectively investigate whether AA is positively and OA is negatively 
      associated with incident UC development, using data from 7-day food diaries.
      METHODS: A total of 25 639 men and women, aged between 40 and 79 years, from
      Norfolk, UK, were recruited into the prospective European Prospective
      Investigation into Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk cohort between 1993 and 1997. At
      baseline, participants completed 7-day food diaries, checked by nutritionists
      using a database containing 11 000 foods and 55 000 portion sizes. The cohort was
      monitored until June 2004 to identify participants who developed UC. Each patient
      was matched for age and sex with four controls, and conditional logistic
      regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios for AA and OA intakes, and 
      UC association. RESULTS: Of the participants, 26 (58% men) developed incident UC 
      (53% left sided) after a median follow-up time of 3.8 years (0.5-8.3 years). The 
      highest AA tertile was positively associated with an odds ratio of 6.09 [95%
      confidence interval (CI) 1.05-35.23], with a trend across tertiles [odds ratio
      (OR) 2.43, 95% CI 1.06-5.61, P=0.04]. The highest tertile of OA intake was
      inversely associated with a 0.03 OR for UC (95% CI 0.002-0.56) and an inverse
      trend (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.10-0.90, P=0.03). CONCLUSION: Dietary AA was positively 
      and OA was inversely associated with UC development, with large effect sizes in a
      dose-dependent manner. This supports roles for measuring these nutrients in
      future etiological studies and modifying intake in future interventional studies 
      in patients with established disease.

TI  - Dynamics of vitamin D in patients with mild or inactive inflammatory bowel
      disease and their families.
PG  - 145
LID - 10.1186/1475-2891-12-145 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: 25(OH) vitamin D levels may be low in patients with moderately or
      severely active inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD: Crohn's disease and Idiopathic 
      Ulcerative Colitis) but this is less clear in patients with mild or inactive IBD.
      Furthermore there is limited information of any family influence on 25(OH)
      vitamin D levels in IBD. As a possible risk factor we hypothesize that vitamin D 
      levels may also be low in families of IBD patients. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate
      25[OH] vitamin D levels in patients with IBD in remission or with mild activity. 
      A second objective is to evaluate whether there are relationships within IBD
      family units of 25[OH] vitamin D and what are the influences associated with
      these levels. METHODS: Participants underwent medical history, physical
      examination and a 114 item diet questionnaire. Serum 25[OH] vitamin D was
      measured, using a radioimmunoassay kit, (replete >/= 75, insufficient 50-74,
      deficient < 25-50, or severely deficient < 25 nmol/L). Associations between
      25[OH] vitamin D and twenty variables were evaluated using univariate regression.
      Multivariable analysis was also applied and intrafamilial dynamics were assessed.
      RESULTS: 55 patients and 48 controls with their respective families participated 
      (N206). 25[OH] vitamin D levels between patients and controls were similar (71.2 
      +/- 32.8 vs. 68.3 +/-26.2 nmol/L). Vitamin D supplements significantly increased 
      intake but correlation with serum 25[OH] vitamin D was significant only during
      non sunny months among patients. Within family units, patients' families had mean
      replete levels (82.3 +/- 34.2 nmol/L) and a modest correlation emerged during
      sunny months between patients and family (r2 =0.209 p = 0.032). These
      relationships were less robust and non significant in controls and their
      families. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with mild or inactive IBD 25[OH] vitamin D
      levels are less than ideal but are similar to controls. Taken together
      collectively, the results of this study suggest that patient family dynamics may 
      be different in IBD units from that in control family units. However contrary to 
      the hypothesis, intra familial vitamin D dynamics do not pose additional risks
      for development of IBD.

AB  - Colon cancer is a major human malignancy that afflicts millions of people
      throughout the world each year. Genetics and diet play large roles in colon
      carcinogenesis although chemicals may also contribute. For the past 40 years,
      scientists have studied experimentally induced intestinal carcinogenesis in
      rodents in order to elucidate the etiology and mechanisms involved. Comparative
      histopathology has revealed many similarities of rodent and human intestinal
      cancers. Comparative molecular pathology has also shown genetic similarities.
      More recently, genetically engineered mice and inflammatory colon cancer models
      have been used for investigating mechanisms and potential chemopreventive and
      treatment modalities. This review will focus on comparative histopathology and
      nonclinical models.

TI  - Exogenous pigment in Peyer patches of children suspected of having IBD.
PG  - 477-80
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000221 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The base of human Peyer patches of the terminal ileum has been noted 
      to contain black granular pigment deposits, composed of titanium dioxide and
      aluminosilicate, which are food additives typically present in a Western diet,
      and pharmaceuticals. In the present study, we investigated the distribution of
      exogenous pigment throughout the gastrointestinal tract of children suspected of 
      having inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the correlation between their age and
      the presence and amount of pigment in Peyer patches, and its relation to
      pediatric IBD. METHODS: Biopsies (upper and lower gastrointestinal tract) from
      children suspected of having IBD who underwent endoscopy, were reassessed by a
      blinded, expert pathologist. The amount of pigment in biopsies was scored using a
      semiquantitative scale (range 0 to +++). RESULTS: A total of 151 children were
      included: 62 with Crohn disease (CD), 26 with ulcerative colitis, and 63 with
      non-IBD. In 63 children (42%), deposits of black pigment were found only in
      biopsies from the terminal ileum, located in Peyer patches. A significant
      correlation was found between increasing age and the amount of pigment (P =
      0.004). Pigment deposits were found significantly less in the patients with CD
      compared with those in patients with ulcerative colitis and those with non-IBD
      (26% vs 62% and 49%, P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: These results provide support for
      the hypothesis that the amount of pigment, only present in Peyer patches in the
      terminal ileum, becomes denser with increasing age. Absence of pigment in Peyer
      patches in a higher number of patients with CD suggests that microparticles may
      have become involved in the inflammatory process, possibly because of disrupted
      autophagy.

AB  - Diffuse gastroduodenitis resembling ulcerative colitis in respect to macro- and
      microscopic findings occurs in ulcerative colitis, although it is rare. Reports
      of gastroduodenitis associated with ulcerative colitis treated with infliximab
      are rare. A 58-year-old man had tarry stool in March 2011. He had a history of
      ulcerative colitis that was diagnosed in 1984. He underwent subtotal colectomy in
      1991. Endoscopy and radiography revealed diffuse friable mucosa throughout the
      duodenum and an ulcer in the middle of the descending portion, resulting in a
      narrow portion.In the stomach, numerous small aphthae were observed in the
      antrum. Biopsy specimens of the duodenum and antrum showed marked inflammatory
      cell infiltration in both areas and cryptitis in the duodenum. Standard induction
      therapy of infliximab was started in April. The ulcer in the descending portion
      became a scar without diffuse mucosal friability in September 2011.

TI  - Diet of patients after pouch surgery may affect pouch inflammation.
PG  - 6458-64
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v19.i38.6458 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To investigate the diet of pouch patients compared to healthy controls, and 
      to correlate pouch patients' diet with disease behavior. METHODS: Pouch patients 
      were recruited and prospectively followed-up at the Comprehensive Pouch Clinic at
      the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center. Pouch behavior was determined based on
      clinical, endoscopic and histological criteria. Healthy age- and sex-matched
      volunteers were selected from the "MABAT" Israeli Nutrition and Public Health
      Governmental Study and served as the control group. All the participants
      completed a 106-item food frequency questionnaire categorized into food groups
      and nutritional values based on those used in the United States Department of
      Agriculture food pyramid and the Israeli food pyramid. Data on Dietary behavior, 
      food avoidance, the use of nutritional supplements, physical activity, smoking
      habits, and body-mass index (BMI) were also obtained. Pouch patients who had
      familial adenomatous polyposis (n = 3), irritable pouch syndrome (n = 4), or
      patients whose pouch surgery took place less than one year previously (n = 5)
      were excluded from analysis. RESULTS: The pouch patients (n = 80) consumed
      significantly more from the bakery products food group (1.2 +/- 1.4 servings/d vs
      0.6 +/- 1.1 servings/d, P < 0.05) and as twice as many servings from the oils and
      fats (4.8 +/- 3.4 servings/d vs 2.4 +/- 2 servings/d, P < 0.05), and the nuts and
      seeds food group (0.3 +/- 0.6 servings/d vs 0.1 +/- 0.4 servings/d, P < 0.05)
      compared to the controls (n = 80). The pouch patients consumed significantly more
      total fat (97.6 +/- 40.5 g/d vs 84.4 +/- 39 g/d, P < 0.05) and fat components
      [monounsaturated fatty acids (38.4 +/- 16.4 g/d vs 30 +/- 14 g/d, P < 0.001), and
      saturated fatty acids (30 +/- 15.5 g/d vs 28 +/- 14.1 g/d, P < 0.00)] than the
      controls. In contrast, the pouch patients consumed significantly fewer
      carbohydrates (305.5 +/- 141.4 g/d vs 369 +/- 215.2 g/d, P = 0.03), sugars (124
      +/- 76.2 g/d vs 157.5 +/- 90.4 g/d, P = 0.01), theobromine (77.8 +/- 100 mg/d vs 
      236.6 +/- 244.5 mg/d, P < 0.00), retinol (474.4 +/- 337.1 mug/d vs 832.4 +/-
      609.6 mug/d, P < 0.001) and dietary fibers (26.2 +/- 15.4 g/d vs 30.7 +/- 14 g/d,
      P = 0.05) than the controls. Comparisons of the food consumption of the patients 
      without (n = 23) and with pouchitis (n = 45) showed that the former consumed
      twice as many fruit servings as the latter (3.6 +/- 4.1 servings/d vs 1.8 +/- 1.7
      servings/d, respectively, P < 0.05). In addition, the pouchitis patients consumed
      significantly fewer liposoluble antioxidants, such as cryptoxanthin (399 +/- 485 
      mug/d vs 890.1 +/- 1296.8 mug/d, P < 0.05) and lycopene (6533.1 +/- 6065.7 mug/d 
      vs 10725.7 +/- 10065.9 mug/d, P < 0.05), and less vitamin A (893.3 +/- 516 mug/d 
      vs 1237.5 +/- 728 mug/d, P < 0.05) and vitamin C (153.3 +/- 130 mg/d vs 285.3 +/-
      326.3 mg/d, P < 0.05) than the patients without pouchitis. The mean BMI of the
      pouchitis patients was significantly lower than the BMI of the patients with a
      normal pouch: 22.6 +/- 3.2 vs 27 +/- 4.9 (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Decreased
      consumption of antioxidants by patients with pouchitis may expose them to the
      effects of inflammatory and oxidative stress and contribute to the development of
      pouchitis.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is commonly believed to increase the risk of
      bone mineral loss, leading to osteoporosis and an increased risk of disabling
      fractures. In this narrative review, we will presenting a summary of the
      published medical literature in regards to the relationship between IBD and the
      development of osteoporosis, bone mineral loss, and fractures. We will explore
      the epidemiology of metabolic bone disease in IBD, focusing on the prevalence and
      both the general and IBD-specific risk factors for the development of
      osteoporosis and of fracture in persons with IBD. We will also examine the role
      of the inflammatory process in IBD promoting excessive bone mineral loss, as well
      as the role that low body mass, corticosteroid use, diet, and nutrient
      malabsorption play in contributing to bone disease. Last, we will discuss our
      recommendation for: screening for osteoporosis in IBD patients, the use of
      preventative strategies, and therapeutic interventions for treating osteoporosis 
      in persons with IBD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the literature for clinical data on infants with allergic or
      eosinophilic colitis. DATA SOURCE: MEDLINE search of all indexes was performed
      using the words "colitis or proctocolitis and eosinophilic" or "colitis or
      proctocolitis and allergic" between 1966 and February of 2013. All articles that 
      described patients' characteristics were selected. DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 770
      articles were identified, of which 32 met the inclusion criteria. The 32 articles
      included a total of 314 infants. According to the available information, 61.6% of
      infants were male and 78.6% were younger than 6 months. Of the 314 patients,
      49.0% were fed exclusively breast milk, 44.2% received cow's milk protein, and
      6.8% received soy protein. Diarrheal stools were described in 28.3% of patients. 
      Eosinophilia was found in 43.8% (115/263) of infants. Colonic or rectal biopsy
      showed infiltration by eosinophils (between 5 and 25 per high-power field) in
      89.3% (236/264) of patients. Most patients showed improvement with the removal of
      the protein in cow's milk from their diet or the mother's diet. Allergy challenge
      tests with cow's milk protein were cited by 12 of the 32 articles (66 patients). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Eosinophilic colitis occurs predominantly in the first six months of
      life and in males. Allergy to cow's milk was considered the main cause of
      eosinophilic colitis. Exclusion of cow's milk from the diet of the lactating
      mother or from the infant's diet is generally an effective therapeutic measure.

TI  - Black raspberries protectively regulate methylation of Wnt pathway genes in
      precancerous colon tissue.
PG  - 1317-27

AB  - Ulcerative colitis is frequently an intermediate step to colon cancer. The
      interleukin-10 knockout mouse is a genetic model of this progression. We report
      that knockout mice fed 5% black raspberries (BRB) had significantly less colonic 
      ulceration as compared with knockout mice that consumed the control diet.
      Dysfunction of the Wnt signaling pathway is a key event in ulcerative
      colitis-associated colon carcinogenesis. Therefore, we investigated the effects
      of BRBs on the Wnt pathway and found that the BRB-fed knockout mice exhibited a
      significantly lower level of beta-catenin nuclear translocation. We followed-up
      this observation by evaluating the effect of BRBs on selected Wnt pathway
      antagonists. The mRNA expression levels of wif1, sox17, and qki were diminished
      in the knockout mice, whereas they were expressed at normal levels in knockout
      mice that were fed BRBs. The lower mRNA expression of these genes in the colon
      from the knockout mice correlated with hypermethylation of their promoter
      regions; BRBs decreased their promoter methylation and increased mRNA expression 
      of these genes. This hypomethylation was associated with elevated protein
      expression of key proteins/enzymes that augment methylation, for example, dnmt3b,
      hdac1, hdac2, and mbd2 in the knockout mice; in addition, BRBs decreased the
      protein expression of these proteins/enzymes. The knockout mouse model
      recapitulates what occurs in human ulcerative colitis. Promoter methylation of
      CDH1 and SFRP1 was significantly higher in human ulcerative colitis tissues
      compared with their adjacent normal tissues. In conclusion, our results suggest
      that BRBs inhibit colonic ulceration and, ultimately, colon cancer partly through
      inhibiting aberrant epigenetic events that dysregulate Wnt signaling.

TI  - Common gastrointestinal symptoms: irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 16-23
AB  - The diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) should be considered when
      patients have had abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating, and change in bowel habits
      for 6 months. Patients may experience variation between periods of constipation
      and diarrhea. When evaluating patients with IBS, physicians should be alert for
      red flag symptoms, such as rectal bleeding, anemia, nighttime pain, and weight
      loss. Physicians also should consider other medical conditions that manifest
      similarly to IBS. Clinicians who are confident in diagnosing IBS based on
      symptoms typically do not obtain many tests unless the patient has red flag
      symptoms. Various etiologic mechanisms have been proposed for IBS, including
      abnormal bowel motility, inflammation, altered mucosal permeability, genetic
      predisposition, and visceral hypersensitivity. Lack of certainty about the
      etiology makes it difficult to develop effective management approaches; thus,
      management is directed toward symptom relief. Dietary changes, such as avoiding
      fermentable carbohydrates, may benefit some patients, especially those with
      bloating. Constipation-dominant IBS can be managed with antispasmodics,
      lubiprostone, or linaclotide, whereas diarrhea-dominant IBS can be managed with
      loperamide or alosetron, though the latter drug can cause ischemic colitis. For
      long-term therapy, tricyclic antidepressants or selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors have good efficacy. Peppermint oil and probiotics also may provide
      benefit.

TI  - Review article: the association of diet with onset and relapse in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1172-87
LID - 10.1111/apt.12501 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of diet in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is supported by 
      migration studies and increasing incidences in line with Westernisation. AIM: To 
      give a complete overview of studies associating habitual diet with the onset or
      relapses in ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: A
      structured search in Pubmed, the Cochrane Library and EMBASE was performed using 
      defined key words, including only full text papers in English language. RESULTS: 
      Forty-one studies were identified, investigating onset (n = 35), relapses (n = 5)
      or both (n = 1). Several studies reported high intake of sugar or
      sugar-containing foods (n = 7 UC, n = 12 CD), and low intake of fruits and/or
      vegetables (n = 5 UC, n = 10 CD) to be associated with an increased onset risk.
      However, these findings could not be confirmed by similar or higher numbers of
      other studies. A possible protective role was found for grain-derived products in
      CD onset, but results were inconsistent for dietary fibre in UC and CD and
      grain-derived products in UC. No definite conclusions could be drawn for
      unsaturated fatty acids (UFA), protein and energy intake due to limited and/or
      inconsistent results. Six studies reported on diet and relapse risk, of which
      only two (n = 1 UC, n = 1 CD) had a prospective follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The
      current evidence is not sufficient to draw firm conclusions on the role of
      specific food components or nutrients in the aetiology of IBD. Furthermore, large
      prospective studies into the role of habitual diet as a trigger of relapses are
      needed, to identify new therapeutic or preventive targets.

TI  - Profermin is efficacious in patients with active ulcerative colitis--a randomized
      controlled trial.
PG  - 2584-92
LID - 10.1097/01.MIB.0000437046.26036.db [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Profermin is developed for the dietary management of ulcerative
      colitis (UC). It consists of water, fermented oats, barley malt, lecithin, and
      Lactobacillus plantarum 299v. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical
      efficacy of Profermin. METHODS: Seventy-four patients with a mild-to-moderate
      flare-up of UC (defined as Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index [SCCAI] score
      >/=5 and </=11) were randomly assigned to Profermin (n = 32) or Fresubin (n =
      41). The primary endpoint was to assess whether addition of Profermin in UC could
      significantly reduce SCCAI in comparison with Fresubin. RESULTS: In the run-in
      period, the mean SCCAI was 7.2 +/- 1.50 in the Profermin group and 7.6 +/- 1.47
      in the Fresubin group (not significant). After 8 weeks of treatment, the mean
      reduction of SCCAI score was higher in the Profermin group (mean difference:
      -1.77 SCCAI, 95% confidence interval -2.97 to -0.55; P < 0.005), in
      intention-to-treat analyses. Remission defined as SCCAI </=2.5 was achieved in 10
      of 32 (31%) in the Profermin group and in 6 of 41 (15%) in the Fresubin group (P 
      = 0.048). The decrease in SCCAI scores of >/=50% was higher in the Profermin
      group 17 of 32 (53%) versus 11 of 41 (27%) (P = 0.04). The risk of dropping out
      due to treatment failure/lack of effect was higher in the Fresubin group (42%
      versus 13%, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation with Profermin is safe, well 
      tolerated, palatable, and able to reduce SCCAI scores at a statistically and
      clinically significant level in patients with mild-to-moderate UC with a
      flare-up.

AB  - Patients have strong beliefs about the role of diet in the cause of inflammatory 
      bowel disease (IBD) and in exacerbating or alleviating ongoing symptoms from IBD.
      The rapid increase in the incidence and prevalence of IBD in recent decades
      strongly suggests an environmental trigger for IBD, one of which may be dietary
      patterns. There are several pathways where diet may influence intestinal
      inflammation, such as direct dietary antigens, altering the gut microbiome, and
      affecting gastrointestinal permeability. However, data that altering diet can
      change the natural history of IBD are scarce, and evidence-based dietary
      guidelines for patients with IBD are lacking. Patients, therefore, seek
      nonmedical resources for dietary guidance, such as patient support groups and
      unverified sources on the Internet. The aim of this review is to identify
      patient-targeted dietary recommendations for IBD and to critically appraise the
      nutritional value of these recommendations. We review patient-targeted dietary
      information for IBD from structured Internet searches and popular defined diets. 
      Patient-targeted dietary recommendations focus on food restrictions and are
      highly conflicting. High-quality dietary intervention studies are needed to
      facilitate creation of evidence-based dietary guidelines for patients with IBD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The therapeutic effect of enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease (CD)
      and the epidemiological associations between diet and inflammatory bowel disease 
      (IBD) implicate diet in IBD causation. There is little evidence, however, to
      support specific dietary changes and patients often receive contradictory advice.
      AIM: To review the literature on the impacts of diet on IBD causation and
      activity to produce guidance based on 'best available evidence'. METHOD: Review
      of Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases from 1975 to 2012 using MeSH headings
      'crohn's disease' 'ulcerative colitis' 'enteral' 'diet' 'nutrition' 'fatty acid' 
      and 'food additives'. RESULTS: Enteral nutrition with a formula-defined feed is
      effective treatment for CD, but approximately 50% of patients relapse within 6
      months of return to normal diet. There is no direct evidence of benefit from any 
      other specific dietary modification in CD, but indirect evidence supports
      recommendation of a low intake of animal fat, insoluble fibre and processed fatty
      foods containing emulsifiers. Foods tolerated in sustained remission may not be
      tolerated following relapse. Some evidence supports vitamin D supplementation. In
      ulcerative colitis (UC), evidence is weaker, but high intakes of meat and
      margarine correlate with increased UC incidence and high meat intake also
      correlates with increased likelihood of relapse. CONCLUSIONS: There is little
      evidence from interventional studies to support specific dietary recommendations.
      Nevertheless, people with IBD deserve advice based on 'best available evidence'
      rather than no advice at all, although dietary intake should not be
      inappropriately restrictive. Further interventional studies of dietary
      manipulation are urgently required.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Osteopenia and increased risk for fractures in IBD result from
      several factors. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the dietary intake of calcium
      in IBD patients. METHODS: A 22-item quantitative validated frequency food
      questionnaire was used for quantifying dietary calcium in relation to gender and 
      age, in 187 IBD patients, 420 normal- and 276 diseased controls. STATISTICAL
      ANALYSIS: Mann-Whitney, chi-square- and T-tests. RESULTS: The mean calcium intake
      was 991.0 +/- 536.0 (105.8% Recommended Daily Allowances) and 867.6 +/- 562.7 SD 
      mg/day (93.8% RDA) in healthy and diseased controls, and 837.8 +/- 482.0 SD
      mg/day (92.7% RDA) in IBD, P<0.001. Calcium intake was high in celiac disease
      (1165.7 +/- 798.8 SD mg/day, 120% RDA), and non-significantly lower in ulcerative
      colitis than in Crohn's disease (798.7 +/- 544.1 SD mg/day vs 881.9 +/- 433.0).
      CD and UC females, but not males, had a mean calcium intake well under RDA. In
      all study groups the intake was lower in patients believing that consumption of
      lactose-containing food induced symptoms, versus those who did not (105.8% vs
      114.3% RDA in normal controls; 100.4% vs 87.6% RDA in IBD). CONCLUSIONS: Diet in 
      IBD patients contained significantly less calcium than in healthy controls.
      Gender and age, more than diagnosis, are central in determining inadequate
      calcium intake, more so in IBD. Self-reported lactose intolerance, leading to
      dietary restrictions, is the single major determinant of low calcium intake.
      Inadequate calcium intake is present in one third of IBD patients and represents 
      a reversible risk factor for osteoporosis, suggesting the need for tailored
      nutritional advice in IBD.

TI  - Protection from inflammatory bowel disease and colitis-associated carcinogenesis 
      with 4-vinyl-2,6-dimethoxyphenol (canolol) involves suppression of oxidative
      stress and inflammatory cytokines.
PG  - 2833-41
LID - 10.1093/carcin/bgt309 [doi]
AB  - Oxidative stress is associated with various pathological processes including
      inflammatory bowel disease, which is a major cause of colon cancer. Here, we
      examined the antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects of
      4-vinyl-2,6-dimethoxyphenol (canolol), a potent antioxidant compound obtained
      from crude canola oil. Oral administration of 2% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)
      resulted in the progression of colitis with shortening of the large bowel length.
      Administering a diet containing canolol significantly suppressed pathogenesis;
      diarrhea markedly improved and the length of large bowel returned to almost
      normal. Pathological examination clearly revealed improvement of colonic ulcers. 
      Production of inflammatory cytokines, i.e. interleukin-12 and tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha, was significantly increased during this pathological process; their
      production was markedly inhibited by canolol. In the azoxymethane/DSS-induced
      colon cancer model, mice receiving canolol had a reduced occurrence of cancer, to
      60%, compared with control mice, 100% of which had colon cancer. The numbers of
      tumors in each mouse were also significantly reduced in mice receiving the
      canolol-containing diet (5.6+/-2.0) compared with azoxymethane/DSS control mice
      (10.8+/-4.2). No apparent toxicity of canolol was observed. Moreover,
      inflammatory cytokines (i.e. cyclooxygenase-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase
      and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) and oxidative responding molecules, i.e. heme
      oxygenase-1, in colon were suppressed during this treatment. In a mouse colon 26 
      solid tumor model, canolol significantly suppressed cyclooxygenase-2 expression; 
      however, no significant tumor growth inhibition was observed, suggesting that
      canolol preferably shows chemopreventive effects during the stages of
      initiation/promotion. Canolol may, thus, be considered a potential cancer
      preventive agent or supplement.

AB  - The inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn's and ulcerative colitis, are common and a
      significant cause of morbidity. They were rare before the 1930's but the
      incidence has been increasing in both developed and developing countries. We have
      recently reported that the incidence in Nova Scotia, the area with one of the
      highest reported burden globally, is decreasing since 1997. We postulate that
      this decrease may be due to the addition of folate to cereals. This was mandated 
      in 1998 but the process of fortification began in 1997. There is circumstantial
      evidence from epidemiology studies that a diet deficient in folate may have
      contributed to the global rise in these diseases. This hypothesis, if proven to
      be correct, has important implications for the prevention and treatment of these 
      diseases.

TI  - Quality of life following ileoanal pouch failure.
PG  - S23-8
AB  - This article describes a novel qualitative study exploring the lived experience
      of participants having undergone ileoanal pouch failure, on a background of
      ulcerative colitis (UC). It focuses on the impact of living with indefinite
      diversion of the pouch and a permanent end ileostomy. Six participants were
      interviewed with an aim to establish their experience of pouch failure and the
      support they required. Five pertinent themes emerged that suggested participants 
      did not expect pouch failure and were unprepared for the regression towards UC.
      Some participants recommenced drug therapy, wore pads to manage leakage from the 
      diverted pouch, avoided certain social settings or manipulated diet and lifestyle
      in order to gain an acceptable quality of life with a permanent ileostomy. Pouch 
      failure potentially presents adverse effects on patients' quality of life, but
      currently there is a deficit in support and resources available in order to
      provide acceptable outcomes for patients experiencing pouch failure.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: ultrasound (US) has been an important diagnostic tool to identify
      several causes of gastrointestinal bleeding. Infants with cow's milk allergy
      (CMA) may present hematochezia and the confirmation of the diagnosis can be
      difficult. The aim of this study is to describe grayscale and color Doppler
      ultrasound findings in patients with CMA. METHODS: we retrospectively studied 13 
      infants with CMA. All infants presented severe hematochezia and abdominal pain.
      All underwent an US study with the diagnosis of allergic colitis. This diagnosis 
      was based on clinical findings, recovery after infant or mother exclusion diets
      in the case of exclusive breastfeeding and positive oral challenge test. RESULTS:
      the mean age ranged from 1 to 6 months (mean=3.53). Seven out of 13 infants
      (53.8%) had grayscale and color Doppler sonographic repeated after exclusion
      diet. Twelve out of 13 (92,3%) showed abnormalities at US and CDUS at beginning. 
      The positive findings suggesting colitis were thickened bowel walls and increased
      vascularity, especially in the descending and sigmoid colon. Colonoscopy and
      histopathological findings were compatible with allergic colitis. After a diet
      change the 13 infants recovered and their oral challenge tests were positive.
      CONCLUSION: Doppler US may be very useful in diagnosing secondary colitis, such
      as CMA, and to exclude several other abdominal diseases that can emulate this
      disease.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases are chronic diseases affecting the gastrointestinal
      tract, whose major forms are represented by Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative
      colitis (UC). Their etiology is still unclear, although several factors have been
      identified as major determinants for induction or relapses. Among these, the role
      of the "forgotten organ", gut microbiota, has become more appreciated in recent
      years. The delicate symbiotic relationship between the gut microbiota and the
      host appears to be lost in IBD. In this perspective, several studies have been
      conducted to assess the role of prebiotics and probiotics in gut microbiota
      modulation. This is a minireview aimed to address in an easy format (simple
      questions-simple answers) some common issues about the theme. An update on the
      role of selected constituents of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBD is
      presented together with the analysis of the efficacy of gut microbiota modulation
      by prebiotics and probiotics administration in the management of IBD.

TI  - Aryl hydrocarbon receptor promotes RORgammat(+) group 3 ILCs and controls
      intestinal immunity and inflammation.
PG  - 657-70
LID - 10.1007/s00281-013-0393-5 [doi]
AB  - Unlike adaptive immune cells that require antigen recognition and functional
      maturation during infection, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) usually respond to
      pathogens promptly and serve as the first line of defense in infectious diseases.
      RAR-related orphan receptor (RORgammat)(+) group 3 ILCs are one of the innate
      cell populations that have recently been intensively studied. During the fetal
      stage of development, RORgammat(+) group 3 ILCs (e.g., lymphoid tissue inducer
      cells) are required for lymphoid organogenesis. In adult mice, RORgammat(+) group
      3 ILCs are abundantly present in the gut to exert immune defensive functions.
      Under certain circumstances, however, RORgammat(+) group 3 ILCs can be pathogenic
      and contribute to intestinal inflammation. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr), a
      ligand-dependent transcriptional factor, is widely expressed by various immune
      and non-immune cells. In the gut, the ligand for Ahr can be derived/generated
      from diet, microflora, and/or host cells. Ahr has been shown to regulate
      different cell populations in the immune system including RORgammat(+) group 3
      ILCs, T helper (Th)17/22 cells, gammadeltaT cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs),
      Tr1 cells, and antigen presenting cells. In this review, we will focus on the
      development and function of RORgammat(+) group 3 ILCs, and discuss the role of
      Ahr in intestinal immunity and inflammation in mice and in humans. A better
      understanding of the function of Ahr in the gut is important for developing new
      therapeutic means to target Ahr in future treatment of infectious and autoimmune 
      diseases.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, which
      are both inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. Both types of
      inflammatory bowel disease have a complex etiology, resulting from a genetically 
      determined susceptibility interacting with environmental factors, including the
      diet and gut microbiota. Genome Wide Association Studies have implicated more
      than 160 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in disease susceptibility. Consideration
      of the different pathways suggested to be involved implies that specific dietary 
      interventions are likely to be appropriate, dependent upon the nature of the
      genes involved. Epigenetics and the gut microbiota are also responsive to dietary
      interventions. Nutrigenetics may lead to personalized nutrition for disease
      prevention and treatment, while nutrigenomics may help to understand the nature
      of the disease and individual response to nutrients.

AB  - Imbalances in gut microbiota composition during ulcerative colitis (UC) indicate 
      a role for the microbiota in propagating the disorder. Such effects were
      investigated using in vitro batch cultures (with/without mucin, peptone or
      starch) inoculated with faecal slurries from healthy or UC patients; the growth
      of five bacterial groups was monitored along with short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)
      production. Healthy cultures gave two-fold higher growth and SCFA levels with up 
      to ten-fold higher butyrate production. Starch gave the highest growth and SCFA
      production (particularly butyrate), indicating starch-enhanced saccharolytic
      activity. Sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) were the predominant bacterial group
      (of five examined) for UC inocula whereas they were the minority group for the
      healthy inocula. Furthermore, SRB growth was stimulated by peptone presumably due
      to the presence of sulphur-rich amino acids. The results suggest raised SRB
      levels in UC, which could contribute to the condition through release of toxic
      sulphide.

      disease and ulcerative colitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Increased intake of dietary fiber has been proposed to reduce 
      the risk of inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease [CD] and ulcerative
      colitis [UC]). However, few prospective studies have examined associations
      between long-term intake of dietary fiber and risk of incident CD or UC. METHODS:
      We collected and analyzed data from 170,776 women, followed up over 26 years, who
      participated in the Nurses' Health Study, followed up for 3,317,425 person-years.
      Dietary information was prospectively ascertained via administration of a
      validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire every 4 years.
      Self-reported CD and UC were confirmed through review of medical records. Cox
      proportional hazards models, adjusting for potential confounders, were used to
      calculate hazard ratios (HRs). RESULTS: We confirmed 269 incident cases of CD
      (incidence, 8/100,000 person-years) and 338 cases of UC (incidence, 10/100,000
      person-years). Compared with the lowest quintile of energy-adjusted cumulative
      average intake of dietary fiber, intake of the highest quintile (median of 24.3
      g/day) was associated with a 40% reduction in risk of CD (multivariate HR for CD,
      0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.39-0.90). This apparent reduction appeared to be
      greatest for fiber derived from fruits; fiber from cereals, whole grains, or
      legumes did not modify risk. In contrast, neither total intake of dietary fiber
      (multivariate HR, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.58-1.17) nor intake of fiber
      from specific sources appeared to be significantly associated with risk of UC.
      CONCLUSIONS: Based on data from the Nurses' Health Study, long-term intake of
      dietary fiber, particularly from fruit, is associated with lower risk of CD but
      not UC. Further studies are needed to determine the mechanisms that mediate this 
      association.

TI  - Multisystemic functions of alkaline phosphatases.
PG  - 27-51
LID - 10.1007/978-1-62703-562-0_3 [doi]
AB  - Human and mouse alkaline phosphatases (AP) are encoded by a multigene family
      expressed ubiquitously in multiple tissues. Gene knockout (KO) findings have
      helped define some of the precise exocytic functions of individual isozymes in
      bone, teeth, the central nervous system, and in the gut. For instance, deficiency
      in tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) in mice (Alpl (-/-) mice) and
      humans leads to hypophosphatasia (HPP), an inborn error of metabolism
      characterized by epileptic seizures in the most severe cases, caused by abnormal 
      metabolism of pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (the predominant form of vitamin B6) and by 
      hypomineralization of the skeleton and teeth featuring rickets and early loss of 
      teeth in children or osteomalacia and dental problems in adults caused by
      accumulation of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi). Enzyme replacement therapy with
      mineral-targeting TNAP prevented all the manifestations of HPP in mice, and
      clinical trials with this protein therapeutic are showing promising results in
      rescuing life-threatening HPP in infants. Conversely, TNAP induction in the
      vasculature during generalized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI), type II 
      diabetes, obesity, and aging can cause medial vascular calcification. TNAP
      inhibitors, discussed extensively in this book, are in development to prevent
      pathological arterial calcification. The brush border enzyme intestinal alkaline 
      phosphatase (IAP) plays an important role in fatty acid (FA) absorption, in
      protecting gut barrier function, and in determining the composition of the gut
      microbiota via its ability to dephosphorylate lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Knockout 
      mice (Akp3 (-/-)) deficient in duodenal-specific IAP (dIAP) become obese, and
      develop hyperlipidemia and hepatic steatosis when fed a high-fat diet (HFD).
      These changes are accompanied by upregulation in the jejunal-ileal expression of 
      the Akp6 IAP isozyme (global IAP, or gIAP) and concomitant upregulation of
      FAT/CD36, a phosphorylated fatty acid translocase thought to play a role in
      facilitating the transport of long-chain fatty acids into cells. gIAP, but not
      dIAP, is able to modulate the phosphorylation status of FAT/CD36. dIAP, even
      though it is expressed in the duodenum, is shed into the gut lumen and is active 
      in LPS dephosphorylation throughout the gut lumen and in the feces. Akp3 (-/-)
      mice display gut dysbiosis and are more prone to dextran sodium sulfate-induced
      colitis than wild-type mice. Of relevance, oral administration of recombinant
      calf IAP prevents the dysbiosis and protects the gut from chronic colitis.
      Analogous to the role of IAP in the gut, TNAP expression in the liver may have a 
      proactive role from bacterial endotoxin insult. Finally, more recent studies
      suggest that neuronal death in Alzheimer's disease may also be associated with
      TNAP function on certain brain-specific phosphoproteins. This review recounts the
      established roles of TNAP and IAP and briefly discusses new areas of
      investigation related to multisystemic functions of these isozymes.

TI  - Risk of colorectal neoplasia in patients with celiac disease: a multicenter
      study.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The association of celiac disease with colorectal neoplasia 
      is controversial. The aim of this study was to determine the risk of colorectal
      neoplasia among patients with celiac disease. METHODS: We carried out a
      multicenter, retrospective case-control study, within four community hospitals.
      Celiac disease patients with a complete colonoscopy were regarded as cases and
      those without celiac disease as controls. For each case, two controls matched for
      age, sex, indication for colonoscopy and colorectal cancer family history, were
      randomly selected. The main outcome evaluated was risk of colorectal polyps,
      adenomas, advanced neoplastic lesions and cancer. RESULTS: We identified 118
      patients with celiac disease and 236 controls. The risk of polyps, adenomas and
      advanced neoplastic lesions was similar in both groups (OR 1.25, CI 0.71-2.18,
      p=0.40; OR 1.39, CI 0.73-2.63, p=0.31; and OR 1.00, CI 0.26-3.72, p=1.00,
      respectively). On multivariate analysis, age >75 years old, and first-grade CRC
      family history were associated with adenomas (OR 2.68 CI 1.03-6.98, OR 6.68 CI
      1.03-47.98 respectively) and advanced neoplastic lesions (OR 15.03, CI 2.88-78.3;
      OR 6.46 CI 1.23-33.79, respectively). With respect to celiac disease
      characteristic, a low adherence to a gluten free diet was independently
      associated with the presence of adenomas (OR 6.78 CI 1.39-33.20 p=0.01).
      CONCLUSIONS: Celiac disease was not associated with an increased risk of
      colorectal neoplasia. Nonadherence to a strict gluten free diet was associated
      with the presence of adenomas. Further studies addressing celiac disease
      characteristics are needed to confirm this observation.

AB  - Allergic colitis is a clinical manifestation of food allergy during the first
      months of life. It is estimated that genetic factors play a role in the
      expression of this allergic disease. This case report described the clinical
      progress of infants who were cousins from two distinct family groups with
      allergic colitis. Five infants under six months of age and of both sexes were
      studied, with a diagnosis of allergic colitis characterized clinically and
      histologically by (1) rectal bleeding; (2) exclusion of infectious causes of
      colitis; (3) disappearance of symptoms after elimination of cow's milk and dairy 
      products from the child's and/or the mother's diet. Patients were submitted to
      the following diagnostic investigation: complete blood count; stool culture;
      parasitologic examination of stools; rectoscopy or colonoscopy; and rectal
      biopsy. Patient age varied from 40 days to six months; three were males. All
      patients presented with complaints of intense colic and rectal bleeding. The
      colonoscopy showed presence of hyperemia of the mucosa with microerosions and
      spontaneous bleeding upon the procedure. Microscopy revealed the existence of
      colitis with eosinophilia > 20 e/HPF. Patients were treated with a hypoallergenic
      formula and showed remission of symptoms. After one year of age, all were
      submitted to an oral challenge with a milk formula and presented food tolerance. 
      Allergic colitis is a disease with evident genetic inheritance and a temporary
      character.

      milk allergy.
PG  - 3824-30
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v19.i24.3824 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To investigate the characteristics of mucosal lesions and their relation to 
      laboratory data and long-term follow up in breast-fed infants with allergic
      colitis. METHODS: In this study 31 breast-fed infants were prospectively
      evaluated (mean age, 17.4 wk) whose rectal bleeding had not ceased after a
      maternal elimination diet for cow's milk. Thirty-four age-matched and breast-fed 
      infants (mean age, 16.9 wk) with no rectal bleeding were enrolled for laboratory 
      testing as controls. Laboratory findings, colonoscopic and histological
      characteristics were prospectively evaluated in infants with rectal bleeding.
      Long-term follow-up with different nutritional regimes (L-amino-acid based
      formula or breastfeeding) was also included. RESULTS: Iron deficiency, peripheral
      eosinophilia and thrombocytosis were significantly higher in patients with
      allergic colitis in comparison to controls (8.4 +/- 3.2 mumol/L vs 13.7 +/- 4.7
      mumol/L, P < 0.001; 0.67 +/- 0.49 G/L vs 0.33 +/- 0.17 G/L, P < 0.001; 474 +/-
      123 G/L vs 376 +/- 89 G/L, P < 0.001, respectively). At colonoscopy,
      lymphonodular hyperplasia or aphthous ulceration were present in 83% of patients.
      Twenty-two patients were given L-amino acid-based formula and 8 continued the
      previous feeding. Time to cessation of rectal bleeding was shorter in the special
      formula feeding group (mean, 1.4 wk; range, 0.5-3 wk) when compared with the
      breast-feeding group (mean, 5.3 wk; range, 2-9 wk). Nevertheless, none of the
      patients exhibited rectal bleeding at the 3-mo visit irrespective of the type of 
      feeding. Peripheral eosinophilia and cessation of rectal bleeding after
      administration of elemental formula correlated with a higher density of mucosal
      eosinophils. CONCLUSION: Infant hematochezia, after cow's milk allergy exclusion,
      is generally a benign and probably self-limiting disorder despite marked mucosal 
      abnormality. Formula feeding results in shorter time to cessation of rectal
      bleeding; however, breast-feeding should not be discouraged in long-lasting
      hematochezia.

TI  - Long-term intake of dietary fat and risk of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 776-84
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2013-305304 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dietary fats influence intestinal inflammation and regulate mucosal
      immunity. Data on the association between dietary fat and risk of Crohn's disease
      (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are limited and conflicting. METHODS: We
      conducted a prospective study of women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study
      cohorts. Diet was prospectively ascertained every 4 years using a validated
      semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Self-reported CD and UC were
      confirmed through medical record review. We examined the effect of
      energy-adjusted cumulative average total fat intake and specific types of fat and
      fatty acids on the risk of CD and UC using Cox proportional hazards models
      adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: Among 170,805 women, we confirmed
      269 incident cases of CD (incidence 8/100,000 person-years) and 338 incident
      cases of UC (incidence 10/100,000 person-years) over 26 years and 3,317,338
      person-years of follow-up. Cumulative energy-adjusted intake of total fat,
      saturated fats, unsaturated fats, n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)
      were not associated with risk of CD or UC. However, greater intake of long-chain 
      n-3 PUFAs was associated with a trend towards lower risk of UC (HR 0.72, 95% CI
      0.51 to 1.01). In contrast, high long-term intake of trans-unsaturated fatty
      acids was associated with a trend towards an increased incidence of UC (HR 1.34, 
      95% CI 0.94 to 1.92). CONCLUSIONS: A high intake of dietary long-chain n-3 PUFAs 
      may be associated with a reduced risk of UC. In contrast, high intake of
      trans-unsaturated fats may be associated with an increased risk of UC.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and relapsing inflammatory
      condition of the gastrointestinal tract. The two main forms of IBD are Crohn's
      disease and ulcerative colitis. According to the recent concept the disease is
      caused by a combination of factors, including genetics, immune dysregulation,
      barrier dysfunction and the change in microbial flora. Environmental factors,
      such as changes in diet, antibiotic use, smoking or improved domestic hygiene
      (e.g. eradication of intestinal helminths) probably contribute to the development
      and increased prevalence of IBD. Dysregulation of mucosal immunity in IBD causes 
      an overproduction of inflammatory cytokines which resulted in uncontrolled
      intestinal inflammation. Based on extensive research over the last decade,
      besides the conventional therapy, there are several novel pathways and specific
      targets, on which focus new therapeutics. New therapeutics aim 1./ to correct
      genetic susceptibility by stimulating NOD2 expression, TLR3 signaling or
      inhibition of TLR4 pathway, 2./ to restore the immune dysregulation by inhibition
      of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-13, IL-17, IL-18, IL-21), Th1 
      polarisation (IL-2, IL-12, IL-23, IFN-gamma ), T-cell activation, leukocyte
      adhesion, as well as by immunostimulation (GM-CSF, G-CSF) and anti-inflammatory
      cytokines (IL-10, IL-11, IFN-beta-1a), 3./ to restore mucosal barrier function
      and stimulate mucosal healing by different growth factors, such as GH, EGF, KGF, 
      TGF-beta, VEGF, 4./ to restore the normal bacterial flora by antibiotics,
      probiotics. However, in spite of these numerous potential targets, the true value
      and clinical significance of most of the new biologics and molecules are not
      clear yet.

TI  - Inadequate nutrient intake in patients with celiac disease: results from a German
      dietary survey.
PG  - 240-6
LID - 10.1159/000348850 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently, the only treatment for celiac disease (CD) is a lifelong
      gluten-free diet (GFD). Research has been carried out in various countries into
      the nutritional adequacy of the GFD in terms of macro- and micronutrients, mostly
      presenting conflicting results. However, no data for Germany are available to
      date. AIM: To elucidate the nutritional composition of a GFD and to compare it
      with non-GFD in a representative German non-CD population. METHODS AND PATIENTS: 
      A total of 1,000 patients who were members of the German Celiac Society (DZG)
      were invited to fill out a prospective 7-day food diary and a questionnaire. Data
      from 88 patients aged 14-80 years were analyzed and compared to the DACH
      reference values and to data from the German National Diet and Nutrition Survey
      (NVS II). RESULTS: No significant difference was observed for the intake of
      energy and macronutrients in male celiac patients compared to the NVS II. Only
      the fiber intake of male patients was significantly lower than that of the
      general population. Female patients, however, showed a significantly higher fat
      intake, but lower carbohydrate consumption. The average daily micronutrient
      intake of male and female patients, specifically of vitamin B1, B2, B6, folic
      acid, magnesium and iron, was significantly lower in celiac patients compared to 
      the NVS II. CONCLUSION: This study reveals inadequate nutrient intake by male and
      female celiac patients in Germany. Based on our findings, regular (laboratory)
      monitoring of celiac patients should be recommended.

TI  - Low and medium but not high doses of green tea polyphenols ameliorated dextran
      sodium sulfate-induced hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity.
PG  - 1223-8
AB  - Our previous study indicated that a diet containing a high dose (1%) of green tea
      polyphenols (GTPs) disrupted liver and kidney function via a reduction in
      antioxidant enzyme and heat shock protein (HSP) levels in both colitis and
      non-treated ICR mice. In the present study, we assessed the effects of 0.01%,
      0.1%, and 1% dietary GTPs on liver and kidney physiological functioning in
      dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-exposed and normal mice. GTPs at 0.01% and 0.1%
      significantly suppressed DSS-increased serum aspartate 2-oxoglutarate
      aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. In contrast,
      GTPs at 1% increased kidney weight, serum creatinine levels, and thiobarbituric
      acid-reactive substances (TBARs) in both the kidney and the liver in normal mice,
      as compared with DSS-exposed mice. GTPs at 0.01% and 0.1% remarkably upregulated 
      the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) mRNA 
      in the liver and kidney of mice exposed to DSS, whereas GTPs at 1% abolished it. 
      Our results indicate that low and medium doses of GTPs have beneficial effects on
      DSS-induced hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity via upregulation of self-protective
      enzymes, while these effects disappeared at a high dose.

TI  - Pediatric and adult celiac disease: similarities and differences.
PG  - 283-8
LID - 10.1007/s12664-013-0339-9 [doi]
AB  - Differences between children and adults in celiac disease (CD) presentation and
      epidemiology are reviewed here. Clinical manifestations, histological changes,
      serology, and response to gluten-free diet are similar. Differences exist in
      epidemiology, type of clinical presentations, coexisting diseases, complications,
      and association with obesity. CD is two to five times more common in children
      than in adults. Classical CD with gastrointestinal symptoms is more common in
      children whereas nonclassical CD dominates in adults. A gene dose phenomenon
      (double-dose HLA-DQB1 02 allele) is postulated to be responsible for this
      difference. Coexisting autoimmune diseases like diabetes mellitus type 1,
      Sjogren's syndrome, and dermatitis herpetiformis are more common in adults than
      in children (42 % vs. 5 %). The association of overweight/obesity and CD is
      stronger in adults than in children (22.5 % vs. 14 %). Besides poor compliance,
      pancreatic insufficiency, bacterial overgrowth, lactose intolerance, irritable
      bowel syndrome, lymphocytic colitis, and microscopic colitis are considered
      responsible for nonresponsive CD in adults but not in children. Complications
      like refractory sprue and small intestinal neoplasms are seen exclusively in
      adults. Existing diagnostic criteria (modified ESPGHAN) are not suitable for
      diagnosing CD in adults as the majority of cases are either nonclassical or
      subclinical CD.

AB  - Colonic diverticula are common in developed countries and complications of
      colonic diverticulosis are responsible for a significant burden of disease.
      Several recent publications have called into question long-held beliefs about
      diverticular disease. Contrary to conventional wisdom, studies have not shown
      that a high-fiber diet protects against asymptomatic diverticulosis. The risk of 
      developing diverticulitis among individuals with diverticulosis is lower than the
      10% to 25% proportion that commonly is quoted, and may be as low as 1% over 11
      years. Nuts and seeds do not increase the risk of diverticulitis or diverticular 
      bleeding. It is unclear whether diverticulosis, absent diverticulitis, or overt
      colitis is responsible for chronic gastrointestinal symptoms or worse quality of 
      life. The role of antibiotics in acute diverticulitis has been challenged by a
      large randomized trial that showed no benefit in selected patients. The decision 
      to perform elective surgery should be made on a case-by-case basis and not
      routinely after a second episode of diverticulitis, when there has been a
      complication, or in young people. A colonoscopy should be performed to exclude
      colon cancer after an attack of acute diverticulitis but may not alter outcomes
      among individuals who have had a colonoscopy before the attack. Given these
      surprising findings, it is time to reconsider conventional wisdom about
      diverticular disease.

AB  - AIMS: To further explore the anti-inflammatory properties of d-Limonene. MAIN
      METHODS: A rat model was used to compare evolution of TNBS (2,5,6-trinitrobenzene
      sulfonic acid)-induced colitis after oral feeding with d-Limonene compared to
      ibuprofen. Peripheral levels of TNF-alpha (Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha) were
      assessed in all animals. Cell cultures of fibroblasts and enterocytes were used
      to test the effect of d-Limonene respectively on TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB
      (nuclear factor-kappa B) translocation and epithelial resistance. Finally,
      plasmatic inflammatory markers were examined in an observational study of diet
      supplementation with d-Limonene-containing orange peel extract (OPE) in humans.
      KEY FINDINGS: Administered per os at a dose of 10mg/kg p.o., d-Limonene induced a
      significant reduction of intestinal inflammatory scores, comparable to that
      induced by ibuprofen. Moreover, d-Limonene-fed rats had significantly lowered
      serum concentrations of TNF-alpha compared to untreated TNBS-colitis rats. The
      anti-inflammatory effect of d-Limonene also involved inhibition of
      TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB translocation in fibroblast cultures. The application 
      of d-Limonene on colonic HT-29/B6 cell monolayers increased epithelial
      resistance. Finally, inflammatory markers, especially peripheral IL-6, markedly
      decreased upon OPE supplementation of elderly healthy subjects submitted or not
      to 56 days of dietary supplementation with OPE. SIGNIFICANCE: In conclusion,
      d-Limonene indeed demonstrates significant anti-inflammatory effects both in vivo
      and in vitro. Protective effects on the epithelial barrier and decreased
      cytokines are involved, suggesting a beneficial role of d-Limonene as diet
      supplement in reducing inflammation.

AB  - The peptide transporter PEPT1, expressed in the brush border membrane of
      enterocytes, mediates the uptake of di- and tripeptides from luminal protein
      digestion in the small intestine. PEPT1 was proposed not to be expressed in
      normal colonic mucosa but may become detectable in inflammatory states such as
      Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. We reassessed colonic expression of PEPT1 
      by performing a systematic analysis of PEPT1 mRNA and protein levels in healthy
      colonic tissues in mice, rats, and humans. Immunofluorescence analysis of
      different mouse strains (C57BL/6N, 129/Sv, BALB/c) demonstrated the presence of
      PEPT1 in the distal part of the colon but not in proximal colon. Rat and human
      intestines display a similar distribution of PEPT1 as found in mice. However,
      localization in human sigmoid colon revealed immunoreactivity present at low
      levels in apical membranes but substantial staining in distinct intracellular
      compartments. Functional activity of PEPT1 in colonic tissues from mice was
      assessed in everted sac preparations using [(1)(4)C]Gly-Sar and found to be
      5.7-fold higher in distal compared with proximal colon. In intestinal tissues
      from Pept1-/- mice, no [(1)(4)C]Gly-Sar transport was detectable but feces
      samples revealed significantly higher water content than in wild-type mice,
      suggesting that PEPT1 contributes to colonic water absorption. In conclusion, our
      studies unequivocally demonstrate the presence of PEPT1 protein in healthy distal
      colonic epithelium in mice, rats, and humans and proved that the protein is
      functional and contributes to electrolyte and water handling in mice.

TI  - How does genotype influence disease phenotype in inflammatory bowel disease?
PG  - 2021-30
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0b013e318281f5c5 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) are chronic 
      immunologically mediated diseases of the gut. Advances in genetics have
      revolutionized our understanding of the pathogenesis of these conditions with 163
      risk loci identified, encompassing a variety of immunologic functions. There is
      substantial heterogeneity in the natural history of these diseases with respect
      to disease onset, course, and progression to complications. There are also
      significant variations in response to therapies and susceptibility to
      therapy-related and disease-related complications. An important need in the field
      is to identify predictors of disease course, complications, and likelihood of
      response and adverse events to allow for targeted therapeutic decision making.
      The genotype of an individual in constant and non-modifiable, and thus could
      potentially fulfill the role of important predictors of these outcomes. In this
      review, we discuss the existing literature on the prediction of various disease
      phenotypes in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis using underlying genotype.
      We also identify gaps in the literature and suggest future directions for
      research. There is need for large, multi-institutional, and international
      collaborative consortia with efficient and detailed cohort accrual, phenotypic
      definition, genotyping, and dynamic assessments of external (e.g., diet) and
      internal (microbiome) environment to allow us to progress toward personalized and
      precision medicine in the management of these complex diseases.

TI  - Altered colonic mucosal availability of n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids
      in ulcerative colitis and the relationship to disease activity.
PG  - 70-9
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2013.03.013 [doi]
LID - S1873-9946(13)00137-2 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) arachidonic acid (AA,
      n-6) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, n-3) are precursors of eicosanoids and other
      lipid mediators which have critical roles in inflammation. The mediators formed
      from the different PUFA have different potencies. We hypothesised that metabolic 
      changes associated with colonic mucosal inflammation would modify the
      bioavailability of the eicosanoid precursors AA and EPA. METHODS: Colonic mucosa 
      biopsies were obtained from patients with ulcerative colitis and from matched
      controls. Inflammation was graded endoscopically and histologically. Esterified
      and non-esterified fatty acids were determined within the biopsies using gas
      chromatography-mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry,
      respectively. RESULTS: Biopsy samples were collected from 69 UC patients (54
      providing both inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa) and 69 controls. Inflamed mucosa
      had higher AA (p<0.001) and lower EPA (p<0.010) contents and a higher AA:EPA
      ratio (p<0.001). Inflamed mucosa also had higher docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) and 
      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and lower linoleic acid (LA) and alpha-linolenic acid 
      (alpha-LNA) contents (all p<0.001), compared to non-inflamed and controls. There 
      were significant correlations between severity of inflammation and contents of
      AA, DPA and DHA (positive correlations) and of LA, alpha-LNA and EPA (negative
      correlations). CONCLUSIONS: Higher AA, AA:EPA ratio, DPA and DHA and lower LA,
      alpha-LNA and EPA are seen in inflamed mucosa in UC and correlate with severity
      of inflammation. This suggests an alteration in fatty acid metabolism in the
      inflamed gut mucosa, which may offer novel targets for intervention and should be
      considered if nutritional strategies are used.

TI  - ACG clinical guidelines: diagnosis and management of celiac disease.
PG  - 656-76; quiz 677
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2013.79 [doi]
AB  - This guideline presents recommendations for the diagnosis and management of
      patients with celiac disease. Celiac disease is an immune-based reaction to
      dietary gluten (storage protein for wheat, barley, and rye) that primarily
      affects the small intestine in those with a genetic predisposition and resolves
      with exclusion of gluten from the diet. There has been a substantial increase in 
      the prevalence of celiac disease over the last 50 years and an increase in the
      rate of diagnosis in the last 10 years. Celiac disease can present with many
      symptoms, including typical gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., diarrhea,
      steatorrhea, weight loss, bloating, flatulence, abdominal pain) and also
      non-gastrointestinal abnormalities (e.g., abnormal liver function tests, iron
      deficiency anemia, bone disease, skin disorders, and many other protean
      manifestations). Indeed, many individuals with celiac disease may have no
      symptoms at all. Celiac disease is usually detected by serologic testing of
      celiac-specific antibodies. The diagnosis is confirmed by duodenal mucosal
      biopsies. Both serology and biopsy should be performed on a gluten-containing
      diet. The treatment for celiac disease is primarily a gluten-free diet (GFD),
      which requires significant patient education, motivation, and follow-up.
      Non-responsive celiac disease occurs frequently, particularly in those diagnosed 
      in adulthood. Persistent or recurring symptoms should lead to a review of the
      patient's original diagnosis to exclude alternative diagnoses, a review of the
      GFD to ensure there is no obvious gluten contamination, and serologic testing to 
      confirm adherence with the GFD. In addition, evaluation for disorders associated 
      with celiac disease that could cause persistent symptoms, such as microscopic
      colitis, pancreatic exocrine dysfunction, and complications of celiac disease,
      such as enteropathy-associated lymphoma or refractory celiac disease, should be
      entertained. Newer therapeutic modalities are being studied in clinical trials,
      but are not yet approved for use in practice. Given the incomplete response of
      many patients to a GFD-free diet as well as the difficulty of adherence to the
      GFD over the long term, development of new effective therapies for symptom
      control and reversal of inflammation and organ damage are needed. The prevalence 
      of celiac disease is increasing worldwide and many patients with celiac disease
      remain undiagnosed, highlighting the need for improved strategies in the future
      for the optimal detection of patients.

TI  - Fasting serum concentration of short-chain fatty acids in subjects with
      microscopic colitis and celiac disease: no difference compared with controls, but
      between genders.
PG  - 696-701
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2013.786128 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), particularly propionic and butyric
      acids, have been shown to have many positive health effects. The amount and type 
      of SCFAs formed from dietary fibre by the colonic microbiota depends on the
      substrate available and is reflected in blood. The total intake and type of
      dietary fibre in people with gastrointestinal diseases differs considerably from 
      healthy subjects. OBJECTIVE: To compare fasting SCFA concentrations in subjects
      with microscopic colitis (MC), celiac disease and controls without these
      diseases. SCFAs were also analysed over 6.5 h in young healthy subjects, who had 
      eaten a fibre-rich breakfast, to identify a possible peak concentration of SCFAs 
      after a meal. METHODS: SCFAs in serum were pre-concentrated using hollow
      fibre-supported liquid membrane extraction and gas chromatography. RESULTS: The
      MC group had a higher concentration of valeric acid than the control group (p <
      0.01). No significant differences in other SCFA concentrations were seen between 
      groups, but the control group tended to have higher concentration of acetic acid 
      (p = 0.1). Furthermore, males had higher concentrations of SCFAs (with the
      exception of valeric acid) than females (p < 0.05), which were independent of
      groups. The peaks for acetic, propionic and butyric acids came approximately 5 h,
      6.5 h and 2-3 h, respectively, after breakfast. CONCLUSION: The fasting
      concentrations of SCFAs were quite similar, although the fibre intake had
      probably been quite different for a long time. The results might have been
      different if SCFAs had been recorded over a longer period.

TI  - The human gut microbiome: a review of the effect of obesity and surgically
      induced weight loss.
PG  - 563-9
LID - 10.1001/jamasurg.2013.5 [doi]
AB  - Recent advances in parallel genomic processing and computational mapping have
      been applied to the native human microbial environment to provide a new
      understanding of the role of the microbiome in health and disease. In particular,
      studies of the distal gut microbiome have proposed that changes in gut microbiota
      are related to obesity, the metabolic syndrome, and Western diet. We examined the
      changes in the distal gut microbiome composition as it relates to the lean and
      obese phenotypes, particularly after surgical weight loss. A PubMed search of
      publications from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2012, used the search
      terms weight, obesity, microbiome, and bariatric surgery. We included studies
      that provided information on subjects' weight and/or body mass index and a formal
      assessment of the microbiome. Certain bacteria, specifically the archaeon
      Methanobrevibacter smithii, have enhanced ability to metabolize dietary
      substrate, thereby increasing host energy intake and weight gain. With weight
      loss, there is a decrease in the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes phyla. One 
      major finding from microbial sequencing analyses after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass
      is the comparative overabundance of Proteobacteria in the distal gut microbiome, 
      which is distinct from the changes seen in weight loss without Roux-en-Y gastric 
      bypass. This review provides the practicing surgeon with (1) an update on the
      state of a rapidly innovating branch of clinical bioinformatics, specifically,
      the microbiome; (2) a new understanding of the microbiome changes after Roux-en-Y
      gastric bypass and weight loss; and (3) a basis for understanding further
      clinical applications of studies of the distal gut microbiome, such as in Crohn
      disease, ulcerative colitis, and infectious colitis.

TI  - Nutritional intake according to injury extent in ulcerative colitis patients.
PG  - 445-51
LID - 10.1111/jhn.12064 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is often associated with nutritional
      deficiency, which appears to contribute to the progression of UC severity. The
      present study aimed to evaluate nutritional status and dietary intake in UC
      remission patients. METHODS: The present study comprised a cross-sectional study 
      in which variables such as extent of disease (distal colitis, left-sided colitis,
      pancolitis), remission period, sex and age were recorded. Extent of disease was
      assessed by the results of a colonoscopy and dietary intake was evaluated by
      using 3-day, 24-h recalls. A Kruskall-Wallis test was used to compare the intake 
      of macro- and micronutrients among the three study groups. The analysis was
      complemented by the Mann-Whitney test. A logistic regression analysis was
      performed to identify predictive factors of extent of disease (pancolitis versus 
      left-sided colitis versus distal colitis). RESULTS: The median (range) age of the
      59 patients was 49.0 (37.0-63.0) years and 53.3% were female. Twenty-six (44.1%) 
      patients had distal colitis, 11 (18.6%) patients had left-sided colitis and 22
      (37.3%) patients had pancolitis. A high probability of an inadequate intake of
      fibre (100%), fat soluble vitamins (>40% for vitamin A and >95% for vitamin E),
      vitamin C (>34%), calcium (>90%) and magnesium (>50%) was identified in the study
      group. Vitamin D intake (odds ratio = 0.60; 95% confidence interval = 0.39-0.94; 
      P < 0.05) was significantly associated with increased intestinal damage.
      CONCLUSIONS: A large number of individuals showed an inadequate intake of
      nutrients. In addition, the consumption of vitamin D was significantly associated
      with extent of disease.

LID - 10.3748/wjg.v19.i11.1827 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To evaluate potential risk factors in the development of ulcerative colitis 
      (UC) in China. METHODS: A total of 1308 patients with UC and 1308 age-matched and
      sex-matched controls were prospectively studied in China. The UC cases were
      collected from 17 hospitals in China from April 2007 to April 2010. Uniform
      questionnaires were designed to investigate risk factors including smoking,
      appendectomy, stress, socio-economic conditions, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs (NSAIDs), oral contraceptives, diet, breastfeeding, infections and family
      sanitary conditions. Group comparisons by each factor were done using simple
      logistic regression analysis. Conditional logistic regression was used for
      multivariate analysis. RESULTS: By univariate analysis, the variables predictive 
      of UC included feeling stress, light and heavy alcoholic drinking, spicy food,
      sugar consumption and infectious diarrhea, while heavy tea intake and tap water
      consumption were protective against UC. On multivariate analysis, the protective 
      factor for UC was tap water consumption [odds ratios (OR) = 0.424, 95%CI:
      0.302-0.594, P < 0.001]; while the potential risk factors for UC were heavy sugar
      consumption (OR = 1.632, 95%CI: 1.156-2.305, P < 0.001), spicy food (light
      intake: OR = 3.329, 95%CI: 2.282-4.857, P < 0.001; heavy intake: OR = 3.979,
      95%CI: 2.700-5.863, P < 0.001), and often feeling stress (OR = 1.981, 95%CI:
      1.447-2.711, P < 0.001). Other factors, such as smoking habit, appendectomy,
      breastfeeding, a history of measles, rural or urban residence, education, oral
      contraceptives, and NSAID use have not been found to have a significant
      association with the development of UC in the present study. CONCLUSION: Our
      study showed tap water consumption was a protective factor for UC, while spicy
      food, heavy sugar consumption and often feeling stress were risk factors for UC
      in this Chinese population.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a debilitating and widespread immune-mediated
      illness characterized by excessive inflammatory and effector mucosal responses
      leading to tissue destruction at the gastrointestinal tract. Interactions among
      the immune system, the commensal microbiota and the host genotype are thought to 
      underlie the pathogenesis of IBD. However, the precise etiology of IBD remains
      unknown. Diet-induced changes in the composition of the gut microbiome can
      modulate the induction of regulatory versus effector immune responses at the gut 
      mucosa and improve health outcomes. Therefore, manipulation of gut microbiota
      composition and the local production of microbial-derived metabolites by using
      prebiotics, probiotics and dietary fibers is being explored as a promising avenue
      of prophylactic and therapeutic intervention against gut inflammation. Prebiotics
      and fiber carbohydrates are fermented by resident microflora into short chain
      fatty acids (SCFAs) in the colon. SCFAs then activate peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma, a nuclear transcription factor with 
      widely demonstrated anti-inflammatory efficacy in experimental IBD. The
      activation of PPARgamma by naturally ocurring compounds such as conjugated
      linoleic acid, pomegranate seed oil-derived punicic acid, eleostearic acid and
      abscisic acid has been explored as nutritional interventions that suppress
      colitis by directly modulating the host immune response. The aim of this review
      is to summarize the status of innovative nutritional interventions against
      gastrointestinal inflammation, their proposed mechanisms of action, preclinical
      and clinical efficacy as well as bioinformatics and computational modeling
      approaches that accelerate discovery in nutritional and mucosal immunology
      research.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Oxidative stress is presumed to play an important role in
      Crohn's disease (CD) pathogenesis. Nevertheless, the evaluation of the intestinal
      antioxidant capacity through the analysis of glutathione peroxidase activity in
      CD remains to be determined. METHODS: 20 CD outpatients and 16 volunteers going
      through colonic cancer screening were enrolled. Colonoscopy with biopsies was
      performed in all individuals. Samples from inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa were 
      taken when there was CD endoscopic activity. Spectrophotometric assays were
      performed to measure tissue glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, and total
      (GSHT) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione in all samples. Demographics and clinical 
      characteristics were collected from clinical charts. RESULTS: Inflamed CD mucosa 
      presented reduced GPx activity compared to non-inflamed CD mucosa (42.94mU/mg
      protein vs 79.62mU/mg protein, P<0.05) and control mucosa (42.94mU/mg protein vs 
      95.08mU/mg protein, P<0.001). GSHT concentration was reduced in inflamed mucosa
      when compared to non-inflamed CD mucosa (0.78mumol/g vs 1.98mumol/g, P<0.01) and 
      the control group (0.78mumol/g vs 2.11mumol/g, P<0.001). A significant
      correlation was detected between GPx activity and GSSG (r=-0.599), disease
      duration (r=0.546), and thiopurine treatment (r=-0.480) in non-inflamed CD
      mucosa. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that reduced GPx activity is present in 
      inflamed CD mucosa. In addition, endoscopic activity, disease duration and
      thiopurine therapy could be associated with mucosal decreased antioxidant
      activity.

TI  - Environment and the inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - e18-24
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which consists of Crohn disease and ulcerative
      colitis, are chronic inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. In
      genetically susceptible individuals, the interaction between environmental
      factors and normal intestinal commensal flora is believed to lead to an
      inappropriate immune response that results in chronic inflammation. The incidence
      of IBD have increased in the past century in developed and developing countries. 
      The purpose of the present review is to summarize the current knowledge of the
      association between environmental risk factors and IBD. A number of environmental
      risk factors were investigated including smoking, hygiene, microorganisms, oral
      contraceptives, antibiotics, diet, breastfeeding, geographical factors, pollution
      and stress. Inconsistent findings among the studies highlight the complex
      pathogenesis of IBD. Additional studies are necessary to identify and elucidate
      the role of environmental factors in IBD etiology.

TI  - Laparoscopic surgery for inflammatory bowel disease--the experience in China.
PG  - 180-5
LID - 10.3109/08941939.2012.732664 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has risen rapidly
      in China over the last 15 years. Increasing numbers of people with IBD require
      surgery during their lifetime, but few reports of IBD in Eastern populations have
      been described to date. The aim of this study was to assess the short-term
      effects of the laparoscopic surgery for IBD in Chinese patients. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: From February 2010 to March 2012, 35 patients with IBD underwent
      laparoscopic operations and the clinical data obtained for these patients were
      reviewed. RESULTS: Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) (N = 21) and ulcerative
      colitis (UC) (N = 14) underwent laparoscopic surgery. In the CD group, the mean
      age was 37.4 years. Two patients (9.5%) required conversion to an open procedure.
      The median length of postoperative hospitalization was 9 (7-40) days. Overall
      morbidity was 26.3% and no patients required re-operation. In the UC group, the
      mean age was 55.2 years. The conversion rate was 14.3% (2/14). The median time to
      regular diet was 4 (3-10) days and the median length of postoperative
      hospitalization was 8 (7-25) days. Four patients developed postoperative
      complications and one patient developed ileostomy retraction requiring urgent
      operative intervention to rebuild the stoma. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic surgery in
      patients with IBD can be accomplished safely and with reasonable operative times,
      conversion rates and morbidity rates. The main advantages of the laparoscopic
      approach are rapid recovery, improved cosmesis, less postoperative pain, and
      patient satisfaction.

PG  - 787-96
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2012-302504 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics are derived from traditional fermented foods, from beneficial
      commensals or from the environment. They act through diverse mechanisms affecting
      the composition or function of the commensal microbiota and by altering host
      epithelial and immunological responses. Certain probiotic interventions have
      shown promise in selected clinical conditions where aberrant microbiota have been
      reported, such as atopic dermatitis, necrotising enterocolitis, pouchitis and
      possibly irritable bowel syndrome. However, no studies have been conducted that
      can causally link clinical improvements to probiotic-induced microbiota changes. 
      Whether a disease-prone microbiota pattern can be remodelled to a more robust,
      resilient and disease-free state by probiotic administration remains a key
      unanswered question. Progress in this area will be facilitated by: optimising
      strain, dose and product formulations, including protective commensal species;
      matching these formulations with selectively responsive subpopulations; and
      identifying ways to manipulate diet to modify bacterial profiles and metabolism.

TI  - Early experience in laparoscopic colectomy for refractory colitis in children.
PG  - 20-1
AB  - There is limited literature endorsing the laparoscopic approach for the treatment
      of refractory colitis in children. We report our experiences of paediatric
      laparoscopic colectomies performed for ulcerative colitis. A retrospective review
      over a three year period was undertaken. Operative time, length of stay,
      post-operative analgesia, time to commencement of diet, and complications were
      recorded. Nine laparoscopic colectomies were performed. Median operative time was
      320 minutes (range--240-475). Mean time to commencement of full diet was 3.9 days
      (range 2-8). Median length of stay was 6 days (range--5-16). In our experience,
      laparoscopic colectomy in children is a feasible and superior method to open
      colectomy and in our opinion, facilitates further restorative procedures and will
      become the default method of treatment in the near future.

      view.

AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammation-associated disease of the colon and
      rectum. The onset and progress of the disease are directly influenced by the
      nature of the intestinal microflora, the intestinal barrier function, and the
      immunological responses of the host. The epithelial invasion of pathogenic
      bacteria due to excess contact and/or barrier dysfunction is related to
      inflammation mediated by intestinal immune responses. Although the etiology of UC
      is not clearly understood, recent studies have shown a rising incidence of UC
      worldwide, and this phenomenon is more prominent in Asian countries and in Asian 
      immigrants in Western countries. The increased prevalence of UC also contributes 
      to an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer. Environmental factors,
      including changes in dietary habits, have been suggested as major risk factors of
      UC. A systematic review showed a negative association between UC risk and
      vegetable intake, whereas total fat, omega-6 fatty acids and meat intake were
      positively associated with an increased risk of UC. Individual dietary factors
      and energy balance have been suggested as having important roles in inducing
      changes in the microbial population and intestinal barrier integrity and in
      regulating inflammatory immune responses, directly or indirectly. Excess energy
      intake is now known to increase pathogenic microbial populations. Likewise, the
      application of appropriate probiotics may reverse the pathogenic progression of
      the disease. In the meantime, dietary anti-inflammatory compounds, including
      omega-3 fatty acids and other phytochemicals, may directly suppress inflammatory 
      responses in the course of UC development. In this review, the increased
      prevalence of UC and its management are interpreted from the standpoint of
      nutritional modulation to regulate the intestinal microflora population,
      intestinal epithelium permeability, and inflammatory responses.

TI  - Intestinal anti-inflammatory activity of luteolin: role of the aglycone in
      NF-kappaB inactivation in macrophages co-cultured with intestinal epithelial
      cells.
PG  - 522-33

AB  - The flavonoid luteolin is reported to exert anti-inflammatory properties. In this
      study, we investigated whether luteolin inhibits gut inflammation, using in vivo 
      and in vitro inflammation models. In a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced
      colitis mouse model, luteolin (20 and 50 mg/kg) significantly ameliorated
      shortening of colon length and histological score. Immunohistochemical analysis
      showed that luteolin also significantly inhibited infiltration of macrophages and
      interferon (IFN)-gamma-producing CD4(+) T cells into the colonic mucosa.
      Treatment with luteolin also improved IFN-gamma mRNA expression in the colon. At 
      the cellular level, a co-culture consisting of intestinal epithelial Caco-2 and
      macrophage RAW264.7 cells, stimulated with lipopolysaccharide, the addition of
      luteolin (100 muM) suppressed interleukin (IL)-8 mRNA expression in Caco-2 cells 
      without epithelial monolayer disruption. Expression of tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF)-alpha protein and proinflammatory cytokines mRNA (TNF-alpha, IL-6, and
      IL-1beta) in RAW264.7 cells were also suppressed. HPLC analysis and subsequent
      cellular assay revealed that aglycone of luteolin was present in the basolateral 
      supernatant of this system at a sufficient concentration to suppress TNF-alpha
      production and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation of RAW264.7 cells. These
      results suggest that the luteolin aglycones released from the Caco-2 epithelium
      inhibits NF-kappaB nuclear translocation in RAW264.7 cells, followed by reduction
      of TNF-alpha mRNA expression, which results in downregulation of IL-8 mRNA

TI  - Does cow's milk protein elimination diet have a role on induction and maintenance
      of remission in children with ulcerative colitis?
PG  - e273-8
LID - 10.1111/apa.12215 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Aims of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of a cow's milk protein
      (CMP) elimination diet on induction and maintenance of remission and to define
      association with atopy in children with ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS:
      Twenty-nine consecutive patients (mean age: 11.2 years; range: 4.6-17 years; F/M:
      15/14) with newly diagnosed UC were randomized either to receive a CMP
      elimination diet (n = 14) or to continue a free diet (n = 15) associated with
      concomitant steroid induction and mesalazine maintenance treatment. Children were
      prospectively evaluated at four time points: within 1 month, 6 months and 1 year 
      after diagnosis or at the time of relapse. RESULTS: Twenty-five of the 29
      enrolled patients responded to the UC induction therapy with a complete remission
      (86.2%), 13 belonging to CMP elimination diet group and 12 to free diet group (p 
      = 0.59). Overall, our data showed that 7 of 13 (53.8%) patients treated with CMP 
      elimination diet and 8 of 15 (53.3%) patients on free diet and UC therapy
      relapsed within 1 year of follow-up (p = 1). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, data of 
      this paediatric, randomized trial suggest that CMP elimination has no role in the
      management of UC in non-sensitized children.

TI  - Cellulose supplementation early in life ameliorates colitis in adult mice.
PG  - e56685
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0056685 [doi]
AB  - Decreased consumption of dietary fibers, such as cellulose, has been proposed to 
      promote the emergence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD: Crohn disease [CD] and
      ulcerative colitis [UC]) where intestinal microbes are recognized to play an
      etiologic role. However, it is not known if transient fiber consumption during
      critical developmental periods may prevent consecutive intestinal inflammation.
      The incidence of IBD peaks in young adulthood indicating that pediatric
      environmental exposures may be important in the etiology of this disease group.
      We studied the effects of transient dietary cellulose supplementation on dextran 
      sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis susceptibility during the pediatric period in mice. 
      Cellulose supplementation stimulated substantial shifts in the colonic mucosal
      microbiome. Several bacterial taxa decreased in relative abundance (e.g.,
      Coriobacteriaceae [p = 0.001]), and other taxa increased in abundance (e.g.,
      Peptostreptococcaceae [p = 0.008] and Clostridiaceae [p = 0.048]). Some of these 
      shifts persisted for 10 days following the cessation of cellulose
      supplementation. The changes in the gut microbiome were associated with transient
      trophic and anticolitic effects 10 days following the cessation of a
      cellulose-enriched diet, but these changes diminished by 40 days following
      reversal to a low cellulose diet. These findings emphasize the transient
      protective effect of dietary cellulose in the mammalian large bowel and highlight
      the potential role of dietary fibers in amelioration of intestinal inflammation.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Diet is known to have a major role in the expression of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The role of dietary interventions and enteral
      nutrition in the management of IBD remains unelucidated. This study was to review
      the current evidence for dietary risk factors for the development of IBD and the 
      efficacies of dietary and enteral interventions. RECENT FINDINGS: High dietary
      intakes of total fats, polyunsaturated fatty acids, omega-6 fatty acids, and meat
      are associated with an increased risk of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. 
      Further prospective studies are required to confirm these observations. Among
      various dietary interventions, none has shown striking efficacy. Meta-analyses
      have shown enteral nutrition to be inferior to corticosteroids in adults with
      active Crohn's disease. However, in children, a meta-analysis has shown no
      significant difference in the remission rates between enteral nutrition and
      corticosteroid therapy. Although the evidence level is not striking, enteral
      nutrition may be useful for maintaining remission in patients with quiescent
      Crohn's disease. SUMMARY: Dietary risk factors for IBD and the therapeutic
      benefit of dietary and enteral interventions need to be confirmed by further well
      designed studies in large cohorts of patients.

AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) incidence has increased over the past fifty years but the
      explanation is unclear. CD can be brought into remission by liquid enteral
      feeding, but the mechanism for this response is unknown. We suggest that
      consumption of emulsifiers in processed foods may promote CD by increasing
      bacterial translocation. This is supported by evidence that (i) geographical
      variation in CD correlates with emulsifier consumption as does the increasing
      incidence of CD in Japan; (ii) although CD incidence also correlates with fat
      consumption, the response to enteral feeding is not affected by the fat content
      of the feed and (iii) very small concentrations of the emulsifier polysorbate 80 
      enhance bacterial translocation across intestinal epithelia. Undigested
      emulsifiers may increase bacterial translocation, particularly in the small
      intestine where the mucus layer is discontinuous. The hypothesis should be
      testable by trials of enteral feeding with/without emulsifiers.

TI  - Diet-induced expansion of pathobionts in experimental colitis: implications for
      tailored therapies.
PG  - 172-4
LID - 10.4161/gmic.23589 [doi]
AB  - Evidence presented in our recent study and elsewhere suggests that the interplay 
      of dietary macronutrients with the intestinal lumen alters the microbial
      environment, and thus host-microbe interactions, in ways that are not always in a
      favorable, mutualistic fashion. Specifically, in inflammatory bowel diseases
      (IBD), experimental and clinical observations have implicated a detrimental
      impact of environmental/microbial factors on the etiopathogenesis of IBD in
      individuals with a background of genetic susceptibility to the disease. Thus, now
      more than ever, we are realizing that specific intestinal microbes can metabolize
      and react to a wide array of dietary compositions that, in turn, markedly alter
      microbial populations. We aimed to understand if certain dietary fats that are
      prevalent in Western diets are capable of precipitating colonic inflammation
      through their actions on the enteric microbiota. On a background of genetic
      susceptibility, these microbial changes can impact host immune homeostasis and
      increase risk for disease. Here we elaborate on our findings and their potential 
      implications for future medical care.

      effects and therapeutic approaches.
PG  - 650-61
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0b013e3182810122 [doi]
AB  - Recent epidemiological studies highlight the key role of the type of consumed
      unsaturated fatty acid and the development of ulcerative colitis (UC). We aimed
      to review the potential mechanisms behind the antiinflammatory effects of
      unsaturated fatty acids on intestinal inflammation, to discuss their potential
      limitations, and to propose a new reappraisal of polyunsaturated fatty acids
      (PUFAs) in the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A literature 
      search using PubMed was carried out to identify relevant studies (basic science, 
      epidemiological studies, or clinical trials) with unsaturated fatty acids and
      IBD. Only articles published in English were included. IBD patients exhibit an
      altered lipid metabolism. While in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated
      the antiinflammatory properties of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in
      experimental models IBD, results of clinical trials have been disappointing. In
      addition, the impact of fatty acid on innate immunity as an alternative
      therapeutic approach is explored. This may offer insight into therapeutic avenues
      for designing n-3 PUFA diet therapy for IBD.

      involved in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), for which there are
      plausible biological mechanisms. Our aim was to perform the first prospective
      cohort study investigating if there is an association between obesity and the
      development of incident IBD. METHODS: A total of 300,724 participants were
      recruited into the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition
      study. At recruitment, anthropometric measurements of height and weight plus
      physical activity and total energy intake from validated questionnaires were
      recorded. The cohort was monitored identifying participants who developed either 
      Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). Each case was matched with four 
      controls and conditional logistic regression used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) 
      for body mass index (BMI) adjusted for smoking, energy intake, and physical
      activity. RESULTS: In the cohort, 177 participants developed incident UC and 75
      participants developed incident CD. There were no associations with the four
      higher categories of BMI compared with a normal BMI for UC (Ptrend=0.36) or CD
      (Ptrend=0.83). The lack of associations was consistent when BMI was analyzed as a
      continuous or binary variable (BMI 18.5<25.0 vs. >/=25 kg/m(2)). Physical
      activity and total energy intake, factors that influence BMI, did not show any
      association with UC (physical activity, Ptrend=0.79; total energy intake,
      Ptrend=0.18) or CD (physical activity, Ptrend=0.42; total energy, Ptrend=0.11).
      CONCLUSIONS: Obesity as measured by BMI is not associated with the development of
      incident UC or CD. Alternative measures of obesity are required to further
      investigate the role of obesity in the development of incident IBD.

AB  - Celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease including ulcerative colitis (UC)
      and Crohn's disease are both immune-mediated enteropathies. It is rare for both
      celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease to occur together in an individual 
      patient. This association has been reported in adults, however, very rarely in
      children. Here, we report an unusual case of an 8-year-old child with a history
      of anemia and failure to thrive who presented with bloody diarrhea. His
      evaluation showed anemia, elevated inflammatory markers, and positive celiac
      antibodies. Endoscopic evaluation revealed partial duodenal villous atrophy and
      pancolitis. He was diagnosed with celiac disease and UC and responded well to a
      gluten-free diet and steroid/mesalamine therapy. The patient's genetic testing
      revealed markers showing susceptibility for both celiac disease and UC. It is
      important to be aware of this association as both conditions can present with
      similar clinical features, however, require different therapeutic approaches.

TI  - The fatty acid profile of the erythrocyte membrane in initial-onset inflammatory 
      bowel disease patients.
PG  - 1235-43
LID - 10.1007/s10620-012-2508-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The sudden change in the dietary habits of the
      Japanese population towards a European/American-style diet since the 1960s is
      thought to be responsible for the recent increase in the incidence of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Japan. Dietary fatty acid intake influences
      the fatty acid profiles of vital cell membranes, which might be a source of
      inflammatory mediators. METHODS: We investigated the fatty acid composition of
      the erythrocyte membrane in 90 healthy Japanese and 43 initial-onset IBD patients
      (ulcerative colitis, UC: 25; Crohn's disease, CD: 18) who had not undergone any
      dietary intervention to examine the role fatty acids play in the onset of IBD.
      RESULTS: The erythrocyte membrane n-3/n-6 ratio of the initial-onset IBD patients
      was 0.42 +/- 0.13, which was not significantly different from that of the healthy
      Japanese subjects (0.41 +/- 0.13). However, the CD patients displayed a
      significantly lower mean percentage weight (MPW) of linoleic acid (LA) than the
      healthy subjects (8.25 +/- 1.75 vs. 9.90 +/- 1.29; p < 0.001), while their MPW of
      arachidonic acid (AA) was significantly higher than those of the healthy subjects
      and UC patients (11.22 +/- 2.18 vs. 9.76 +/- 1.64, p < 0.01; vs. 9.58 +/- 1.97, p
      < 0.01, respectively). The mean delta 6-desaturation index of the CD patients was
      significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects (1.61 +/- 0.65 vs. 1.11
      +/- 0.26; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The CD patients displayed significantly higher
      and lower MPW of AA and LA, respectively, than the healthy subjects, suggesting
      that delta 6-desaturase is hyperactivated in CD. The cell membrane fatty acid
      profile might be a therapeutic target in CD.

TI  - Probiotics in the management of irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 184-9
LID - 10.1097/MOG.0b013e32835d7bba [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is direct evidence that the pathogenesis of inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) involves the gastrointestinal microbiota and some evidence
      that the microbiota might also play a similar role in irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS). The aim of this article is to review the emerging evidence for the
      mechanisms and effectiveness of probiotics in the management of these disorders. 
      RECENT FINDINGS: The composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota is strongly
      influenced by factors including age, diet and disease. Probiotics may be
      effective through their impact on the host gastrointestinal microbiota and
      promotion of mucosal immunoregulation. Probiotics are considered to be well
      tolerated, although the quality of studies and health claims has been variable.
      There are many short-term studies demonstrating the effectiveness of probiotics
      in IBS, although recommendations should be made for specific strains and for
      specific symptoms. Within IBD, a number of trials have shown the benefits of a
      range of probiotics in pouchitis and in ulcerative colitis, although current
      evidence in Crohn's disease is less promising. SUMMARY: Clearly, some probiotics 
      have considerable potential in the management of IBS and IBD; however, the
      benefits are strain specific. High-quality trials of probiotics in
      gastrointestinal disorders as well as laboratory investigations of their
      mechanism of action are required in order to understand who responds and why.

TI  - Strong correlation between diet and development of colorectal cancer.
PG  - 190-8
AB  - Multiple factors have been described among the causes of non-hereditary
      colorectal cancer. In Western countries, the most common risk factors include
      upper-middle socioeconomic status and dietary regimens rich in proteins and
      animal fats. High consumption of red meats, smoked foods, cold cuts, or canned
      foods is believed to contribute to carcinogenesis as they directly affect
      epithlial turnover and cause metabolism of biliary acids. Dietary fibers have
      protective effects in that they capture the fats and biliary acids, thereby
      inhibiting their activity. Tobacco smoking acts both locally and systemically on 
      the colorectal mucosa through the production of carcinogenic agents. Finally, the
      action of alcohol, in association with nicotine addiction, also increases the
      risk of developing colorectal tumors. Knowledge of dietary and environmental
      factors is of paramount importance in implementing preventive strategies for
      colorectal cancer.

TI  - [Serum metabolome by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in patients
      with ulcerative colitis and celiac disease].
PG  - 44-57
AB  - Metabolomics is the emerging science of measurement and analysis of
      metabolome--the complete set of low molecular weight compounds in a cell, tissue,
      organ or whole organism. One of the aims of metabolomics is to research the
      response of an organism to a pathophysiological insult by measuring the
      concentrations of small molecule metabolites in biofluids and tissues and its
      dynamics. Intestinal microbiota is most probably involved in the development and 
      maintenance of autoimmune inflammation in ulcerative colitis and celiac disease. 
      Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC - MS) of serum generates comprehensive
      metabolic profiles, reflecting integrated human (systemic) and gut microbial
      metabolism which may be altered in disease states. The aim of this study was to
      investigate GC - MS-based serum metabolomic profiles in UC and CD patients. Serum
      metabolic profiles were collected from 75 individuals: 20 patients with
      mild-moderate active UC, 35 CD patients, and 20 healthy controls (HC). We
      characterized 84 serum metabolites by use GC-MS. 18 metabolites at least have a
      combined (human + microbial) origin. In serum of UC patients, phenylacetic acid
      (PAA), 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (4-HPAA), 3-indolylacetic acid (IAA), succinic 
      acid (SA) and fumaric acid (FA) were the metabolites most prominently increased, 
      whereas 3-phenylpropionic acid (PPA) was significantly decreased. Serum of CD
      patients showed significant increases in IAA, 3-indolepropionic acid (IPA), SA
      and FA. Increased serum levels of succinic acid suggest its possible damaging
      effect on intestinal mucosa especially in ulcerative colitis. Orally administered
      butyrate + inulin as supplement to mesalazine in UC or gluten free diet in CD was
      effective in reducing disease activity with a marked improvement of serum
      metabolomic profiles (including SA reduction) and gut microbiota in both
      diseases. There were no any adverse events.

AB  - Acute diarrhea is defined as an abnormally frequent discharge of semisolid or
      fluid fecal matter from the bowel, lasting less than 14 days. More than three
      millions cases of acute diarrhea, presumably due to intestinal infections, are
      seen in general practice every year in France. Most of the cases are benign and
      resolve under symptomatic treatment within 3 days, without need for biological
      tests or antibiotics. In special contexts (septicemic syndrome, visible blood in 
      stools, severe dehydration, patients at risk of severe sepsis [valvulopathy]),
      biologic tests and probabilist antibiotic treatment are required. Hygiene,
      rehydration and diet recommendations are always part of the treatment of acute
      diarrhea, in addition to the symptomatic treatment of diarrhea and other
      digestive symptoms. Antibiotic-associated diarrhea is clinically benign in most
      cases, and attributed to transient dysbiosis of gut microbiota. In the remaining 
      cases, diarrhea is the clinical expression of intestinal infection by Clostridium
      difficile, that should be treated with metronidazole, or the clinical expression 
      of a Klebsiella oxytoca-associated colitis that usually spontaneously resolves
      after stopping antibiotics.

TI  - Environmental triggers for inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 302
LID - 10.1007/s11894-012-0302-4 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases [IBD; Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC)] 
      are chronic immunologically mediated diseases that are due to a dysregulated
      immune response to intestinal flora in a genetically susceptible host. Despite
      advances in genetics, the likelihood of occurrence of disease remains
      incompletely explained and there appears to be a strong role for the environment 
      in mediating risk of disease. Smoking remains the most widely studied and
      replicated risk factor, contributing to increased risk and severity of CD while
      conferring protection against UC. Recent data has suggested novel risk factors.
      Lower plasma vitamin D is associated with an increased risk of Crohn's disease,
      and vitamin D supplementation may prevent relapse of disease. Several medications
      including oral contraceptives, post-menopausal hormone replacement, aspirin,
      NSAIDs, and antibiotics may increase risk of CD or UC with the mechanisms of
      effect remaining inadequately defined. There is continuing evidence that
      depression and psychosocial stress may play a role in the pathogenesis of both CD
      and UC, while at the same time also increasing risk for disease flares. There is 
      also a growing understanding of the role of diet on IBD, in particular through
      its effect on the microbiome. Animal protein intake and n-6 fatty acids may
      increase risk of UC while n-3 fatty acids and dietary fiber may confer
      protection. The effect of diet on established disease remains poorly studied.
      There is need for routine measurement of a spectrum of environmental exposures in
      prospective studies to further our understanding.

TI  - DHA-enriched fish oil targets B cell lipid microdomains and enhances ex vivo and 
      in vivo B cell function.
PG  - 463-70
LID - 10.1189/jlb.0812394 [doi]
AB  - DHA is a n-3 LCPUFA in fish oil that generally suppresses T lymphocyte function. 
      However, the effect of fish oil on B cell function remains relatively
      understudied. Given the important role of B cells in gut immunity and increasing 
      human fish oil supplementation, we sought to determine whether DFO leads to
      enhanced B cell activation in the SMAD-/- colitis-prone mouse model, similar to
      that observed with C57BL/6 mice. This study tested the hypothesis that DHA from
      fish oil is incorporated into the B cell membrane to alter lipid microdomain
      clustering and enhance B cell function. Purified, splenic B cells from DFO-fed
      mice displayed increased DHA levels and diminished GM1 microdomain clustering.
      DFO enhanced LPS-induced B cell secretion of IL-6 and TNF-alpha and increased
      CD40 expression ex vivo compared with CON. Despite increased MHCII expression in 
      the unstimulated ex vivo B cells from DFO-fed mice, we observed no difference in 
      ex vivo OVA-FITC uptake in B cells from DFO or CON mice. In vivo, DFO increased
      lymphoid tissue B cell populations and surface markers of activation compared
      with CON. Finally, we investigated whether these ex vivo and in vivo observations
      were consistent with systemic changes. Indeed, DFO-fed mice had significantly
      higher plasma IL-5, IL-13, and IL-9 (Th2-biasing cytokines) and cecal IgA
      compared with CON. These results support the hypothesis and an emerging concept
      that fish oil enhances B cell function in vivo.

TI  - Reduced bone breakage and increased bone strength in free range laying hens fed
      omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplemented diets.
PG  - 578-86
LID - 10.1016/j.bone.2012.11.003 [doi]
LID - S8756-3282(12)01345-2 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are the
      immediate precursors to a number of important mediators of immunity, inflammation
      and bone function, with products of omega-6 generally thought to promote
      inflammation and favour bone resorption. Western diets generally provide a 10 to 
      20-fold deficit in omega-3 PUFAs compared with omega-6, and this is thought to
      have contributed to the marked rise in incidence of disorders of modern human
      societies, such as heart disease, colitis and perhaps osteoporosis. Many of our
      food production animals, fed on grains rich in omega-6, are also exposed to a
      dietary deficit in omega-3, with perhaps similar health consequences. Bone
      fragility due to osteoporotic changes in laying hens is a major economic and
      welfare problem, with our recent estimates of breakage rates indicating up to 95%
      of free range hens suffer breaks during lay. METHODS: Free range hens housed in
      full scale commercial systems were provided diets supplemented with omega-3 alpha
      linolenic acid, and the skeletal benefits were investigated by comparison to
      standard diets rich in omega-6. RESULTS: There was a significant 40-60% reduction
      in keel bone breakage rate, and a corresponding reduction in breakage severity in
      the omega-3 supplemented hens. There was significantly greater bone density and
      bone mineral content, alongside increases in total bone and trabecular volumes.
      The mechanical properties of the omega-3 supplemented hens were improved, with
      strength, energy to break and stiffness demonstrating significant increases.
      Alkaline phosphatase (an osteoblast marker) and tartrate-resistant acid
      phosphatase (an osteoclast marker) both showed significant increases with the
      omega-3 diets, indicating enhanced bone turnover. This was corroborated by the
      significantly lower levels of the mature collagen crosslinks, hydroxylysyl
      pyridinoline, lysyl pyridinoline and histidinohydroxy-lysinonorleucine, with a
      corresponding significant shift in the mature:immature crosslink ratio.
      CONCLUSIONS: The improved skeletal health in laying hens corresponds to as many
      as 68million fewer hens suffering keel fractures in the EU each year. The
      biomechanical and biochemical evidence suggests that increased bone turnover has 
      enhanced the bone mechanical properties, and that this may suggest potential
      benefits for human osteoporosis.

PG  - 198-201

AB  - Allergic colitis (AC) typically develops in the first weeks or months of life and
      is characterized by the presence of red blood in the stools of healthy breastfed 
      or formula fed infants. In this paper, we describe a case of rectal bleeding in
      monozygotic preterm twins that was resolved with the introduction of a cow's milk
      protein-free diet (CMPFD). The occurrence of this disorder in monozygotic twins
      raises the question as to whether the underlying abnormality in the immune
      regulation, which leads to poor acquisition of tolerance to cow's milk proteins, 
      might be inherited or environmentally acquired. The case also highlights the use 
      of the probiotic Lactobacillus GG (LGG) in the treatment of allergic colitis.

TI  - Tolerability of curcumin in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease: a forced-dose
      titration study.
PG  - 277-9
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e318276977d [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by chronic
      intestinal inflammation in the absence of a recognized etiology. The primary
      therapies are medications that possess anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive
      effects. Given the high use of complementary alternative medicines in pediatric
      IBD, a prospective tolerability study of curcumin, an herbal therapy with known
      anti-inflammatory effects, was conducted to assess possible dosage in children
      with IBD. METHODS: Prospectively, patients with Crohn disease or ulcerative
      colitis in remission or with mild disease (Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity
      Index [PCDAI] <30 or Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index [PUCAI] score
      <34) were enrolled in a tolerability study. All patients received curcumin in
      addition to their standard therapy. Patients initially received 500 mg twice per 
      day for 3 weeks. Using the forced-dose titration design, doses were increased up 
      to 1 g twice per day at week 3 for a total of 3 weeks and then titrated again to 
      2 g twice per day at week 6 for 3 weeks. Validated measures of disease activity, 
      using the PUCAI and PCDAI, and the Monitoring of Side Effect System score were
      obtained at weeks 3, 6, and 9. RESULTS: All patients tolerated curcumin well,
      with the only symptom that was consistently reported during all 3 visits being an
      increase in gassiness, which occurred in only 2 patients. Three patients saw
      improvement in PUCAI/PCDAI score. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests that
      curcumin may be used as an adjunctive therapy for individuals seeking a
      combination of conventional medicine and alternative medicine.

TI  - 5-Aminosalicylates and renal function monitoring in inflammatory bowel disease: a
      nationwide survey.
PG  - 551-5
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2012.08.013 [doi]
LID - S1873-9946(12)00391-1 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: 5-Aminosalicylates (ASA) are widely used in inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD). Nephrotoxicity has been described in some IBD patients
      treated with 5-ASA. Whether physicians managing these patients are monitoring
      renal function in daily practice is unknown. The aims of this paper were to
      investigate how private gastroenterologists monitor renal function and manage
      renal failure in IBD patients treated with oral 5-ASA therapy. METHODS: This was 
      a web-based cross sectional national survey which was conducted among private
      gastroenterologists. RESULTS: A total of 249 practitioners completed the survey. 
      Eighty two percent (n=205) of responders declared that they always monitor renal 
      function. The respondents monitored twice a year Glomerular Filtration Rate
      (eGFR) using Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) [90% (n=225)] and
      Creatinine Clearance (CCr) using a 24-hour urine collection [51% (n=126)]. Blood 
      electrolytes, 24-hour urinary protein rate and dipsticks are performed by 41%,
      39% and 22% of practitioners, respectively. Before oral 5-ASA initiation, 59%
      (n=148) of respondents screen for renal failure. In case of elevated serum
      creatinine, a nephrologist's opinion is asked by 80% (n=200) of responders and by
      76% (n=189) of respondents before treatment initiation. CONCLUSIONS: Most
      gastroenterologists are monitoring renal function once or twice a year in IBD
      patients on 5-ASA. Less than two thirds of them screen for renal failure before
      treatment initiation. MDRD is mainly used, but a wide range of parameters is
      evaluated.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: To evaluate presence of sero-negative spondyloarthritis (SpA)
      in celiac disease (CD) patients, and whether compliance with a gluten free diet
      (GFD) improved arthritis manifestations in these patients. METHODS: We undertook 
      a prospective, questionnaire based, cross-sectional cohort study to evaluate the 
      presence or absence of SpA simultaneously in both CD and non-CD cohorts. RESULTS:
      356/590 (60.3%) patients with CD participated in this study. 99% had diagnosis
      confirmed by a diagnostic test (79% small bowel biopsy, 19.8% blood test, 3.9%
      stool test). Approximately 131 (37%) cases of arthritis were reported in CD
      patients. Of the 6/356 CD patients with seronegative spondyloarthritides, four
      had sacroiliitis, two ankylosing spondylitis, and one psoriatic arthritis,
      compared to one ankylosing spondylitis and five psoriatic arthritis in non-CD.
      Osteoarthritis (89 vs 59, P = 0.93) was the most common diagnosis reported by
      respondents. More CD patients with diarrhea (94%) and anemia (81%) improved on
      GFD, compared to arthritis symptoms (30%). Autoimmune thyroiditis (10.6% vs
      0.4%), insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) (2.2% vs 1.7%), systemic Lupus 
      erythematosus (SLE) (1.1% vs 0), and psoriasis (12.9% vs 5.5%) occurred more
      frequently in CD patients. The prevalence of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis,
      Sjogren's syndrome, primary biliary cirrhosis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis
      was around 1% each. Univariate Logistic regression analysis showed </= high
      school education (odds ratio [OR] 2.01, P < 0.003), age >/= 60 years (OR 4.13, P 
      < 0.001), and osteoporosis (OR 2.78, P < 0.001) to be significantly associated
      with report of arthritis in CD patients. CONCLUSION: We did not find a high rate 
      of SpA in CD patients. In contrast, increased rates of autoimmune thyroiditis,
      SLE, IDDM, and psoriasis were seen in CD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment resistant chronic pouchitis causes significant morbidity.
      Elemental diet is effective treatment for Crohn's disease. Since pouchitis shares
      some similarities to Crohn's disease we hypothesised that elemental diet may be
      an effective treatment. METHOD: Seven pouchitis patients (with ulcerative
      colitis) were studied. All had active pouchitis with a pouch disease activity
      index (PDAI) >/=7. Exclusion criteria were recent NSAIDs, antibiotics or
      probiotics. Sufficient elemental diet to achieve energy requirements was
      provided. Flexible-pouchoscopy was performed, and the Cleveland Global Quality of
      Life score (CGQoL), Pouch Disease Activity Index (PDAI) and BMI were recorded at 
      baseline and following 28 days of elemental diet. Faecal samples were also
      collected at these time points and analysed for major bacterial groups using
      culture independent fluorescence in situ hybridisation. Data were analysed using 
      Wilcoxon's signed-rank test. RESULTS: Following 28 days of exclusive elemental
      diet, median stool frequency decreased from 12 to 6 per day (p=0.028), median
      clinical PDAI decreased from 4 to 1 (p=0.039). There was no significant
      difference in quality of life scores or PDAI before and following treatment.
      There was a trend towards an increase in the concentration of Clostridium
      coccoides-Eubacterium rectale (median 7.9 to 8.5 log(1)(0)/g, p=0.08) following
      exclusive elemental diet. CONCLUSION: Treatment with four weeks elemental diet
      appeared to improve the symptoms of chronic pouchitis in some patients but is not
      an effective strategy for inducing remission. Although a potential symptom
      modifier, elemental diet cannot be recommended for the routine treatment of
      active pouchitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To identify environmental risk factors for developing
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children <15 years of age. METHODS: IBD
      patients and randomly selected healthy controls from a well defined geographical 
      area in Denmark were prospectively recruited in the period 1.1.2007-31.12.2009.
      Data regarding socioeconomic status, area of residence, living conditions,
      infections and diet were obtained by a questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 118 IBD
      patients (59 Crohn's disease (CD), 56 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 3 IBD
      unclassified (IBDU)) and 477 healthy controls filled out the questionnaire. The
      response rates were 91% in patients and 45% in controls, respectively. Several
      risk factors for IBD were identified: IBD in first degree relatives (IBD: OR
      (odds ratio): 6.1 (95%CI: 2.5-15.0), CD (OR: 6.8 (2.3-20.2)) and UC (OR: 6.1
      (2.3-16.0))); bedroom sharing (IBD: OR: 2.1 (1.0-4.3), CD (OR: 3.6 (1.3-9.4)));
      high sugar intake (IBD: OR: 2.5 (1.0-6.2), CD (OR: 2.9 (1.0-8.5))); prior
      admission to a hospital for gastrointestinal infections (IBD: 7.7 (3.1-19.1), CD 
      (7.9 (2.5-24.9)) and UC (7.4 (2.5-21.6))); stressful events (IBD: 1.7 (1.0-2.9)).
      Protective factors were daily vs. less than daily vegetable consumption (CD: 0.3 
      (0.1-1.0), UC (0.3 (0.1-0.8))) and whole meal bread consumption (IBD: OR: 0.5
      (0.3-0.9), CD (0.4 (0.2-0.9))). An increased risk of diagnosis of CD compared to 
      UC was shown for patients living in more urban areas (OR: 1.3 (1.1-1.6)).
      CONCLUSION: We identified several risk and protective factors for developing IBD.
      Studies on the influence of environmental factors are important in our
      understanding of aetiology and phenotypes of paediatric IBD.

AB  - Numerous complications can occur in celiac disease, nutritional (growth failure
      in children, malnutrition, vitamin deficiencies), hematologic (anaemia), bone
      disease (osteoporosis, fracture), gynaecologic (hypo fertility), cardiovascular
      (coronaropathy, venous thrombosis), neurological (peripheral neuropathy), hepatic
      (cytolysis, cirrhosis). Celiac disease is associated with an increased risk of
      autoimmune diseases (type 1 diabetes, thyroiditis), and cancer (upper digestive
      tract, hepatocellular carcinoma, lymphoma). The main digestive complications are 
      microscopic colitis and refractory sprue, which are resistant to gluten-free
      diet. It can be associated with a monoclonal proliferation of intraepithelial
      lymphocytes (type 2 refractory sprue), which may be considered as a cryptic
      lymphoma and can lead to invasive T lymphoma, which occurs in one celiac patient 
      in 1000. Gluten-free diet protects from the occurrence of most complications and 
      correct the over-mortality related to these complications.
