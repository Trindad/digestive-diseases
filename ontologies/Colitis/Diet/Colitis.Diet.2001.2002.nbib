TI  - Treatment of ulcerative colitis by feeding with germinated barley foodstuff:
      first report of a multicenter open control trial.
PG  - 67-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: Germinated barley foodstuff (GBF) is a prebiotic foodstuff that
      effectively increases luminal butyrate production by stimulating the growth of
      protective bacteria. In the first pilot study, GBF has been shown to reduce both 
      clinical activity and mucosal inflammation in ulcerative colitis (UC). The aim of
      this study was to investigate the efficacy of GBF in the treatment of UC in a
      multicenter open control trial. METHODS: Eighteen patients with mildly to
      moderately active UC were divided into two groups using a random allocation
      protocol. The control group (n = 7) were given a baseline anti-inflammatory
      therapy for 4 weeks. In the GBF-treated group (n = 11), patients received 20-30 g
      GBF daily, together with the baseline treatment, for 4 weeks. The response to the
      treatments was evaluated clinically and endoscopically. Fecal microflora were
      also analyzed. RESULTS: After 4 weeks of observation, the GBF-treated group
      showed a significant decrease in clinical activity index scores compared with the
      control group (P < 0.05). No side effects related to GBF were observed. GBF
      therapy increased fecal concentrations of Bifidobacterium and Eubacterium
      limosum. CONCLUSIONS: Oral GBF therapy may have the potency to reduce clinical
      activity of UC. We believe that these results support the use of GBF
      administration as a new adjunct therapy for UC.

PG  - 196-9
AB  - The food-induced eosinophilic proctocolitis is a major cause of blood-tinged
      stools and appears in the first two months of life. The infant is generally
      described as well, but the clinical features and laboratory results are often
      nonspecific. We present an early infant with fresh blood stools at 50 days. The
      colonoscopy and biopsy of the rectum and lower sigmoid revealed lymphoid nodular 
      hyperplasia of the submucose and eosinophil infiltration (40 to 50 per high power
      field) of the lamina propria and intraepithelial. Elimination of the offending
      protein from the diet, through the use of an extensively hydrolyzed casein-based 
      formula and soy, lead to clinical resolution of bleeding at 48 hours. We made a
      review of the case.

TI  - [Diet therapy in chronic inflammatory bowel disease: results from meta-analysis
      and randomized controlled trials].
PG  - 2041-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic inflammatory bowel
      diseases of unknown etiology. Unspecific immunosuppressive therapy represents
      current standard treatment and is often associated with severe side effects.
      Several treatment regimens have been evaluated to identify alternative
      therapeutic options. Among these different diet therapies were investigated.
      Objective of this paper is to review the results of diet therapy in chronic
      inflammatory bowel disease on the basis of randomised controlled trials and
      meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. METHODS: Medline and Cochrane
      Library were searched for meta-analysis and randomised controlled trials
      investigating this question. Additionally reference lists of identified articles 
      and text books were checked for further trials. RESULTS: Four meta-analyses
      investigated the treatment of acute Crohn's disease with elemental-,
      semi-elemental-, and polymeric diets in comparison to corticosteroids or to
      another form of enteral diet. All meta-analyses show a superiority of
      corticosteroids and no difference in the effect of the compared enteral diets.
      Randomised controlled trials investigating diet therapy in ulcerative colitis
      have not been summarised in a meta-analysis yet. Eleven randomised trials were
      identified which evaluated diets in ulcerative colitis patients: Dietary
      supplementation with n-3-fatty acids (6 trials), elemental diet [2], dietary
      supplementation with dietary fiber [1], elimination diet [1], and dietary
      supplementation with olestra [1]. Only for the elimination diet a significant
      positive effect on the course of disease was found in one trial which
      investigated only 18 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Enteral nutritional therapy of acute 
      Crohn's disease is less effective than treatment with corticosteroids. In case of
      severe steroid induced side effects diet treatment can present a promising
      alternative. Superiority of one of the investigated different formulations was
      not found. Meta-analyses of randomised trials provide a clear and easy to
      understand presentation of the effect of this intervention. Eleven published
      trials investigating the effect of diets in ulcerative colitis show only for
      elimination diet a positive treatment effect. The trials do find a positive
      effect of one of the other interventions but the trials are very small and cannot
      exclude a treatment effect. Meta-analysis of these trials would be helpful for a 
      better presentation and understanding of these results.

TI  - Omega-3 fatty acids in inflammation and autoimmune diseases.
PG  - 495-505
AB  - Among the fatty acids, it is the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) which
      possess the most potent immunomodulatory activities, and among the omega-3 PUFA, 
      those from fish oil-eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid
      (DHA)--are more biologically potent than alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). Some of the 
      effects of omega-3 PUFA are brought about by modulation of the amount and types
      of eicosanoids made, and other effects are elicited by eicosanoid-independent
      mechanisms, including actions upon intracellular signaling pathways,
      transcription factor activity and gene expression. Animal experiments and
      clinical intervention studies indicate that omega-3 fatty acids have
      anti-inflammatory properties and, therefore, might be useful in the management of
      inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Coronary heart disease, major depression,
      aging and cancer are characterized by an increased level of interleukin 1 (IL-1),
      a proinflammatory cytokine. Similarly, arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative
      colitis and lupus erythematosis are autoimmune diseases characterized by a high
      level of IL-1 and the proinflammatory leukotriene LTB(4) produced by omega-6
      fatty acids. There have been a number of clinical trials assessing the benefits
      of dietary supplementation with fish oils in several inflammatory and autoimmune 
      diseases in humans, including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative
      colitis, psoriasis, lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis and migraine
      headaches. Many of the placebo-controlled trials of fish oil in chronic
      inflammatory diseases reveal significant benefit, including decreased disease
      activity and a lowered use of anti-inflammatory drugs.

TI  - Stones from bowel disease.
PG  - 979-99
AB  - Kidney stones are increased in patients with bowel disease, particularly those
      who have had resection of part of their gastrointestinal tract. These stones are 
      usually CaOx, but there is a marked increase in the tendency to form uric acid
      stones, as well, particularly in patients with colon resection. These patients
      all share a tendency to chronic volume contraction due to loss of water and salt 
      in diarrheal stool, which leads to decreased urine volumes. They also have
      decreased absorption, and therefore diminished urinary excretion, of citrate and 
      magnesium, which normally act as inhibitors of CaOx crystallization. Patients
      with colon resection and ileostomy form uric acid stones, as loss of bicarbonate 
      in the ileostomy effluent leads to formation of an acid urine. This, coupled with
      low urine volume, decreases the solubility of uric acid, causing crystallization 
      and stone formation. Prevention of stones requires treatment with alkalinizing
      agents to raise urine pH to about 6.5, and attempts to increase urine volume,
      which increases the solubility of uric acid and prevents crystallization.
      Patients with small bowel resection may develop steatorrhea; if the colon is
      present, they are at risk of hyperoxaluria due to increased permeability of the
      colon to oxalate in the presence of fatty acids, and increased concentrations of 
      free oxalate in the bowel lumen due to fatty acid binding of luminal calcium. EH 
      leads to supersaturation of urine with respect to CaOx, in conjunction with low
      volume, hypocitraturia and hypomagnesuria. Therapy involves a low-fat,
      low-oxalate diet, attempts to increase urine volume, and agents such as calcium
      given to bind oxalate in the gut lumen. Correction of hypocitraturia and
      hypomagnesuria are also helpful.

TI  - Polyunsaturated fatty acids and inflammatory diseases.
PG  - 388-96
AB  - Inflammation is overall a protective response, whose main goal is to liberate the
      human being of cellular lesions caused by micro-organisms, toxins, allergens,
      etc., as well as its consequences, and of death cells and necrotic tissues.
      Chronic inflammation, which is detrimental to tissues, is the basic pathogenic
      mechanism of hypersensitivity reactions against xenobiotics. Other frequent
      pathologies, for instance atherosclerosis, chronic hepatitis, inflammatory bowel 
      disease (IBD), liver cirrhosis, lung fibrosis, psoriasis, and rheumatoid
      arthritis are also chronic inflammatory diseases. Chemical mediators of
      inflammation are derived from blood plasma or different cell-type activity.
      Biogenic amines, eicosanoids and cytokines are within the most important
      mediators of inflammatory processes. The different activities of eicosanoids
      derived from arachidonic acid (20:4 n-6) versus those derived from
      eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5 n-3) are one of the most important mechanisms to
      explain why n-3, or omega-3, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) exhibit
      anti-inflammatory properties in many inflammatory diseases. Dietary supplements
      ranging 1-8 g per day of n-3 PUFA have been reportedly beneficial in the
      treatment of IBD, eczema, psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, recent
      experimental studies in rats with experimental ulcerative colitis, induced by
      intrarectal injection of trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid, have documented that
      treatment with n-3 long-chain PUFA reduces mucosal damage as assessed by
      biochemical and histological markers of inflammation. Moreover, the defence
      antioxidant system in this model is enhanced in treated animals, provided that
      the n-3 PUFA supply is adequately preserved from oxidation.

TI  - Total N-nitroso compounds and their precursors in hot dogs and in the
      gastrointestinal tract and feces of rats and mice: possible etiologic agents for 
      colon cancer.
PG  - 3526S-3529S
LID - 10.1093/jn/132.11.3526S [doi]
AB  - We review evidence that red and processed meat are causes of colon cancer and
      that processed meat is a risk factor for childhood cancer and type 2 diabetes.
      Associations could be due to N-nitroso compounds (NOCs) derived from nitrosation 
      of NOC precursors (NOCPs). We review our survey of total NOC and NOCP content of 
      foods. Only rapidly nitrosated amines, including a glycosyl amino acid, were
      efficiently determined as NOCPs. NOCPs in hot dogs and rat feces were partly
      purified by adsorption-desorption and HPLC. After nitrosation, purified hot dog
      fractions were directly mutagenic in Ames test. The main NOCPs in these materials
      may be N-glycosyl amino acids and peptides. NOC levels in rat gastrointestinal
      tract rose steadily from stomach to feces. NOCP levels showed similar trend but
      with sharp increases from stomach to duodenum. One day after Min and C57BL/6J
      mice were fed 4% dextran sulfate sodium to induce acute colitis, fecal NOC levels
      increased 1.9-fold compared with untreated mice (P < 0.05). For 7 d Swiss mice
      received semipurified diet, 180 g beef-pork hot dogs mixed with 820 g diet or 180
      g sauteed beef mixed with 820 g diet. Fecal NOC outputs on day 7 were 3.7-5.0
      (hot dog) and 2.0-2.9 (beef) times those for control groups (P < 0.002 for
      combined groups), perhaps reflecting higher dietary NOC intakes. Feeding a
      similar hot dog mixture to mice did not affect normal 7-methyldeoxyguanosine
      level in colonic mucosal DNA. Overall, results support the hypothesis that
      colonic NOCs are a cause of colon cancer.

TI  - Dietary fiber down-regulates colonic tumor necrosis factor alpha and nitric oxide
      production in trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced colitic rats.
PG  - 3263-71
AB  - Previous studies have revealed the beneficial effects exerted by dietary fiber in
      human inflammatory bowel disease, which were associated with an increased
      production of SCFA in distal colon. The aim of the present study was to elucidate
      the probable mechanisms involved in the beneficial effects of a
      fiber-supplemented diet (5% Plantago ovata seeds) in the trinitrobenzenesulfonic 
      acid (TNBS) model of rat colitis, with special attention to its effects on the
      production of some of the mediators involved in the inflammatory response, such
      as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and nitric oxide (NO). Rats were fed
      the fiber-supplemented diet for 2 wk before TNBS colitis induction and thereafter
      until colonic evaluation 1 wk later. The results obtained showed that dietary
      fiber supplementation facilitated recovery from intestinal insult as evidenced
      both histologically, by a preservation of intestinal cytoarchitecture, and
      biochemically, by a significant reduction in colonic myeloperoxidase activity and
      by restoration of colonic glutathione levels. This intestinal anti-inflammatory
      effect was associated with lower TNFalpha levels and lower NO synthase activity
      in the inflamed colon, showing significant differences when compared with
      nontreated colitic rats. Moreover, the intestinal contents from fiber-treated
      colitic rats showed a significantly higher production of SCFA, mainly butyrate
      and propionate. We conclude that the increased production of these SCFA may
      contribute to recovery of damaged colonic mucosa because they constitute
      substrates for the colonocyte and, additionally, that they can inhibit the
      production of proinflammatory mediators, such as TNFalpha and NO.

TI  - [Immunologic methods in diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease].
PG  - 468-71
AB  - Chronic inflammatory bowel disease is included into autoimmune diseases, which is
      proved by presence of inflammatory lesions, circulating autoantibodies and the
      deposits of immune complexes in tissues. Coeliac disease (classic and atypical
      form), Crohn's Disease and ulcerative colitis are considered as chronic
      autoimmune bowel diseases. The auto-antibodies can be detected with indirect
      immunofluorescence, ELISA and immunoblotting methods. In coeliac disease the
      autoantibodies against endomysium (tissue transglutaminase) and antibodies
      against gliadin are found in patient's sera. The auto-antibody detecting is
      helpful in establishing diagnosis, controlling gluten-free diet effectiveness and
      during gluten challenge. In Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis immunological 
      laboratory tests are helpful to confirm the clinical diagnosis. The following
      auto-antibodies are tested: against cytoplasm of exocrinal pancreatic cells, and 
      products of these cells, against the neutrophile cytoplasm and against goblet
      cells. The antibodies against Saccharomyces cerevisiae are also investigated. The
      clinical relevance of above autoantibodies is not clear, but it is suggested that
      their presence correlates with exacerbations and severe clinical outcome. In the 
      present study the pictures of autoantibodies from fluorescent microscope were
      shown.

TI  - The pathology of diverticular disease.
PG  - 543-62
AB  - Diverticular disease is common in the elderly Western population and its
      complications are frequent clinical presentations. Despite this, the pathogenesis
      of the condition remains relatively poorly understood. Several theories have been
      developed, the most acceptable suggesting elastosis of the taeniae coli as the
      primary event, causing shortening of the sigmoid colon, with relative mucosal
      excess and subsequent mucosal herniations. A Western-type diet is implicated in
      the increased uptake of proline from the gut, leading to elastosis of the sigmoid
      colon. For pathologists, in clinical practice, the disease is most commonly seen 
      in sigmoid colonic resection specimens, usually performed for complications of
      the disease. It is now realised that mucosal biopsies of the luminal mucosa, in
      the sigmoid colon affected by diverticular disease, can produce perplexing
      pathological changes. In particular diverticular colitis can mimic both
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease: care should be taken when diagnosing
      chronic inflammatory bowel disease on a background of diverticular disease. For
      pathologists, diverticular disease remains something of an enigma: although
      common, its pathogenesis remains ill-defined and its complications can provide
      diagnostic difficulties, which require precise clinical and radiological
      correlation.

TI  - Growth in paediatric Crohn's disease.
PG  - 11-5
AB  - Growth failure (GF) is one of the major complications affecting children with
      inflammatory bowel disease. The faltering is temporary in 40-50% of cases and
      prolonged in 10-20% in Crohn's disease (CD). Such failure is rare in children
      with ulcerative colitis (5%). This complication is often associated with retarded
      bone development and delayed onset of sexual maturation. The delayed linear
      growth has a variety of causes including insufficient intake due to anorexia and 
      the inflammatory process with increased energy and protein expenditure. Other
      factors are increased intestinal loss, secondary hypopituitarism and treatment
      with steroids. Therapeutic strategies of CD in children have changed this last
      decade by introducing new therapeutic agents such as topic steroids,
      immunosuppressors, anti-TNF (antibody and notably in children enteral nutrition
      which has shown its efficacy in inducing remissions of active CD, restoring
      nutritional status and stimulation of linear growth. The results of a recent
      prospective multicentric study over 2 years in 82 CD show that severe GF (-2 SD) 
      is initially present in 15% (n = 12), among them 11 remain < -2SD after 2 years
      of follow-up. Six patients who were on the normal range initially increased their
      GF during the follow-up (< -2SD) (total 21% < -2SD (n = 17) at 2 years). At
      inclusion in this group there was no difference in growth velocity, used of
      steroids, enteral nutrition or severity of CD as compared to the group with no
      GF. It suggests that new treatment strategy should be developed in the future for
      this specific complication of paediatric CD.

TI  - Colon mucosal pathology in infants under three months of age with diarrhea
      disorders.
PG  - 387-90
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diarrhea is a common disease in infants. It may result in
      catastrophic events, especially in early infancy. Sometimes it is difficult to
      point out the diagnosis after initial examination. Sigmoidoscopy with mucosal
      biopsy may help in assessing the nature of the disease. The goals of this study
      are to evaluate the colon mucosal pathology in young infants with unknown
      diarrhea disorders and the clinical courses of different etiologies. METHODS: We 
      performed a retrospective analysis of 64 young infants (Mean +/- SD: 1.68 +/-
      1.01 months) in whom a diagnosis of unknown diarrhea disorder had been made after
      an initial investigation. All infants received fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy and
      mucosal biopsy with consent obtained. RESULTS: The appearance of the colon mucosa
      under endoscopy were: 36 (56.2%) showing edema, 30 (46.8%) showing nodularity, 23
      (35.9%) patients with focal erythema and friable mucosa, 11 (17.1%) showed
      erosion, 7 (10.9%) patients showing hemorrhage, and negative finding in one
      patient (1.6%). Colon mucosa pathologic findings were established: 40 (62.5%) had
      eosinophilic colitis (EC) and 19 (29.7%) had nonspecific colitis. The biopsies
      were normal in 5 cases; 81.5%(22/27) of patients with EC showed eosinophils in
      the stool smear which was significantly higher ( = 0.04) compared to the group II
      (9/17); 34 of 40 EC patients responded rapidly to changes in formula. CONCLUSION:
      Sigmoidoscopy and mucosal biopsy may be useful in the pathologic diagnosis of
      unknown diarrhea disorders. Eosinophilic colitis accounts for over half of very
      young infants with diarrhea disorders suggesting for allergic etiology. Patients 
      with allergic colitis may exhibit a dramatic response to elimination of the
      offending proteins from the diet.

TI  - N-3 fatty acids for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 391-5
AB  - The aim of the present paper is to briefly review the literature relating to
      clinical studies of the use of polyunsaturated long-chain fatty acids in the
      treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis and
      Crohn's disease. The reasons for the discrepancies in the findings could be
      related to the different study designs, different treatments, overlapping of
      treatment effects, as well as the variety of treatment formulations and doses
      used, which have led to results that are, in certain instances, very difficult to
      explain. Emphasis on a treatment formulation which reduces the incidence of side 
      effects, together with careful selection of patients and experimental design,
      seems to be associated with benefits, and these studies point to the therapeutic 
      potential for these lipids in the therapy of IBD. It is possible that these fatty
      acids act by reducing low-grade active inflammation rather than by preventing
      reinitiation of the inflammatory process from a truly quiescent state. Whether
      this treatment is applicable to all IBD patients has not been fully elucidated.
      Nevertheless, taken together, all these studies suggest the effectiveness of
      these new therapeutic approaches, not only when conventional treatment fails or
      when it is not possible to treat chronically, but also, in some instances, as
      first choice.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel diseases: principles of nutritional therapy.
PG  - 187-98
AB  - Inflammatory Bowel Diseases - ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease- are chronic
      gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases of unknown etiology. Decreased oral
      intake, malabsorption, accelerated nutrient losses, increased requirements, and
      drug-nutrient interactions cause nutritional and functional deficiencies that
      require proper correction by nutritional therapy. The goals of the different
      forms of nutritional therapy are to correct nutritional disturbances and to
      modulate inflammatory response, thus influencing disease activity. Total
      parenteral nutrition has been used to correct and to prevent nutritional
      disturbances and to promote bowel rest during active disease, mainly in cases of 
      digestive fistulae with high output. Its use should be reserved for patients who 
      cannot tolerate enteral nutrition. Enteral nutrition is effective in inducing
      clinical remission in adults and promoting growth in children. Due to its low
      complication rate and lower costs, enteral nutrition should be preferred over
      total parenteral nutrition whenever possible. Both present equal effectiveness in
      primary therapy for remission of active Crohn's disease. Nutritional intervention
      may improve outcome in certain individuals; however, because of the costs and
      complications of such therapy, careful selection is warranted, especially in
      patients presumed to need total parenteral nutrition. Recent research has focused
      on the use of nutrients as primary treatment agents. Immunonutrition is an
      important therapeutic alternative in the management of inflammatory bowel
      diseases, modulating the inflammation and changing the eicosanoid synthesis
      profile. However, beneficial reported effects have yet to be translated into the 
      clinical practice. The real efficacy of these and other nutrients (glutamine,
      short-chain fatty acids, antioxidants) still need further evaluation through
      prospective and randomized trials.

AB  - Some inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal system are associated with
      neurological symptoms which, in rare cases, may precede the onset of the
      gastrointestinal manifestation of the disease. Celiac sprue is characterized by
      an intolerance to the wheat protein gluten. The typical neurological
      manifestation of celiac sprue is cerebellar ataxia. The ataxia as well as the
      gastrointestinal symptoms can be treated with a strictly gluten-free diet. The
      neurological symptoms of Whipple's disease, a disorder caused by gram-positive
      bacilli, are variable. Typical symptoms of cerebral Whipple's disease include
      dementia, ophthalmoplegia, movement disorders, and signs of hypothalamic
      dysfunction. Nowadays, the diagnosis of cerebral Whipple's disease is made by PCR
      detection of the bacilli in the CSF. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are
      associated with neurological symptoms to a similar proportion. Various forms of
      polyneuropathies have been observed. The CNS manifestations of inflammatory bowel
      diseases include thromboembolic stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, and cerebral 
      vasculitis.

TI  - Probiotics as modulators of the gut flora.
PG  - S39-49
AB  - Probiotic ingestion can be recommended as a preventative approach to maintaining 
      the balance of the intestinal microflora and thereby enhance 'well-being'.
      Research into the use of probiotic intervention in specific illnesses and
      disorders has identified certain patient populations that may benefit from the
      approach. Undoubtedly, probiotics will vary in their efficacy and it may not be
      the case that the same results occur with all species. Those that prove most
      efficient will likely be strains that are robust enough to survive the harsh
      physico-chemical conditions present in the gastrointestinal tract. This includes 
      gastric acid, bile secretions and competition with the resident microflora. A
      survey of the literature indicates positive results in over fifty human trials,
      with prevention/treatment of infections the most frequently reported output. In
      theory, increased levels of probiotics may induce a 'barrier' influence against
      common pathogens. Mechanisms of effect are likely to include the excretion of
      acids (lactate, acetate), competition for nutrients and gut receptor sites,
      immunomodulation and the formation of specific antimicrobial agents. As such,
      persons susceptible to diarrhoeal infections may benefit greatly from probiotic
      intake. On a more chronic basis, it has been suggested that some probiotics can
      help maintain remission in the inflammatory conditions, ulcerative colitis and
      pouchitis. They have also been suggested to repress enzymes responsible for
      genotoxin formation. Moreover, studies have suggested that probiotics are as
      effective as anti-spasmodic drugs in the alleviation of irritable bowel syndrome.
      The approach of modulating the gut flora for improved health has much relevance
      for the management of those with acute and chronic gut disorders. Other target
      groups could include those susceptible to nosocomial infections, as well as the
      elderly, who have an altered microflora, with a decreased number of beneficial
      microbial species. For the future, it is imperative that mechanistic interactions
      involved in probiotic supplementation be identified. Moreover, the survival
      issues associated with their establishment in the competitive gut ecosystem
      should be addressed. Here, the use of prebiotics in association with useful
      probiotics may be a worthwhile approach. A prebiotic is a dietary carbohydrate
      selectively metabolised by probiotics. Combinations of probiotics and prebiotics 
      are known as synbiotics.

      future.
PG  - S5-9
AB  - Probiotic therapy is attracting the renewed interest of clinicians and basic
      investigators from a variety of traditional research disciplines. While the
      theoretical rationale for modifying the commensal flora of the gastrointestinal
      tract in specific circumstances appears sound and requires scientific pursuit,
      the field of probiotics has been clouded by exaggerated claims from some
      quarters. In general, many of the claims for therapeutic efficacy have not been
      well substantiated, but the field is now poised for evaluation within the realm
      of evidence-based medicine. Alterations in commensal bacterial flora within the
      gastrointestinal tract are associated with susceptibility to pathogens such as
      Clostridium difficile and there is persuasive evidence that the normal flora may 
      participate in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease and other chronic
      diseases in genetically susceptible individuals. This has prompted various
      strategies to fortify or otherwise modify the enteric flora by dietary
      supplements containing probiotic formulations. Detailed comparisons of probiotic 
      performance amongst different bacterial strains have not been performed in vivo
      in man or under clinical trial conditions, and the level of scientific
      characterisation of individual organisms has been variable. In addition, it
      cannot be assumed that the same probiotic is equally suitable for all
      individuals. Moreover, the heterogeneity of clinical disorders such as Crohn's
      disease and ulcerative colitis implies that strain-specific properties may be
      required for subset-specific categories of patients. While cocktails of
      probiotics offer convenience, therapeutic progress may require clarification of
      the mechanism of probiotic action and may be delayed until individual bacterial
      components have been rigorously studied. More importantly, the full potential of 
      therapeutic manipulation of the enteric flora with probiotics or other strategies
      may not be optimally realised until the composition and metabolic activities of
      the normal flora are better understood.

      relationship in the human gut.
PG  - 289-300
AB  - The luminal compartment of the gastrointestinal tract is colonized by a large and
      highly complex microflora providing not only nutritional advances, but also
      representing a potential immunological challenge for the host. Under
      physiological conditions, the immune cells of the colonic mucosa do not defeat
      the microflora. In contrast, in cases of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the
      intestinal microflora appears to be the target of immune reactivity as
      demonstrated in various genetic studies and animal models of mucosal
      inflammation. The mechanisms responsible for the maintenance of this
      immunological unresponsiveness in the mucosal compartment are still largely
      enigmatic though recent studies indicate that luminal components might control
      this peculiar state. The bacterial fermentation product n-butyrate has been
      identified as such as critical molecule. Apart from its essential nutritional
      function for colonocytes, an anti-inflammatory activity of this short-chain fatty
      acid (SCFA) has been recognized in vitro and in vivo. Regarding its molecular
      mode of action, an interference with transcription factors critical for the
      production of pro-inflammatory cytokines has been found. This overview discusses 
      the physiological functions of this bacterial metabolite and its emerging role as
      a potent regulator of mucosal homeostasis. Special emphasis is laid on potential 
      therapeutic implications of SCFA in the treatment of several forms of colitis.

TI  - Etiology of nonresponsive celiac disease: results of a systematic approach.
PG  - 2016-21
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Nonresponse or relapse of symptoms is common in patients with celiac 
      disease treated with gluten free diet. Refractory sprue (RS) is defined as
      initial or subsequent failure of a strict gluten-free diet to restore normal
      intestinal architecture and function in patients who have celiac-like
      enteropathy. The aims of this study were: 1) to identify causes of persistent
      symptoms in patients referred with presumed diagnosis of nonresponsive celiac
      disease (NCD); and 2) to characterize patients with true RS. METHODS: Patients
      were identified who had been systematically evaluated for NCD between January
      1997, and May 2001. Patient records and small bowel biopsy results were reviewed.
      RESULTS: A total of 55 patients were referred with a presumed diagnosis of NCD.
      Six did not have celiac disease and had other diseases responsible for their
      symptoms. Diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss were the most common reasons 
      for evaluation in cases of NCD, whereas weight loss, steatorrhea, and diarrhea
      were the most common presenting features of RS (nine patients). Of the 49
      patients with celiac disease, 25 were identified as having gluten contamination. 
      Additional diagnoses accounting for persistent symptoms included: pancreatic
      insufficiency, irritable bowel syndrome, bacterial overgrowth, lymphocytic
      colitis, collagenous colitis, ulcerative jejunitis, T-cell lymphoma, pancreatic
      cancer, fructose intolerance, protein losing enteropathy, cavitating
      lymphadenopathy syndrome, and tropical sprue. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this study,
      we conclude the following: 1) gluten contamination is the leading reason for NCD;
      2) of NCD cases, 18% are due to RS; and 3) alternative diseases or those
      coexistent with celiac disease and gluten contamination should be ruled out
      before a diagnosis of RS is made.

TI  - Successful nonoperative management of typhlitis in pediatric oncology patients.
PG  - 1151-5
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The optimal management for typhlitis in pediatric oncology
      patients has not always been clear from the medical literature. Trends have
      varied between operative and nonoperative approaches. The aim of this study was
      to review the successful nonoperative management of these patients at our
      institution over the last decade to further clarify management guidelines for
      this difficult problem. METHODS: Medical records of pediatric hematology and
      oncology patients up to 21 years of age with typhlitis diagnosed at the DeVos
      Children's Hospital from 1990 to 2000 were reviewed. RESULTS: Twelve patients
      were included. Ten patients (83%) with computed tomography (CT) scans suggestive 
      of the diagnosis were treated successfully nonoperatively. Management usually
      included bowel rest, antibiotics, and supplemental parenteral nutrition. Two
      patients (17%) in whom CT scans were not obtained underwent surgery for presumed 
      appendicitis and pneumoperitoneum, respectively. Typhlitis was found
      incidentally. In the latter patient, the pneumoperitoneum resulted from a
      perforated jejunum caused by graft-versus-host disease. This patient died of
      septic complications and was the only mortality in the series (8%). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Pediatric cancer patients with typhlitis can be treated carefully nonoperatively 
      with bowel rest, antibiotics, and supplemental nutrition. Usual indications for
      surgery (ie, perforation, clinical deterioration) still should be used. The early
      use of CT scanning helps to facilitate the diagnosis and may provide the ability 
      to differentiate typhlitis from other abdominal diseases for which surgery would 
      be indicated.

TI  - Anti-inflammatory effects of enteral diet components on Crohn's disease-affected 
      tissues in vitro.
PG  - 430-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The mechanism of action of elemental diet in Crohn's disease
      treatment, is unknown. Alteration of bacterial flora, low antigenicity, low fat
      content and improvement of nutritional status are postulated to play a role in
      the anti-inflammatory effect of elemental diet. AIM: To determine whether
      elemental diet or its modifications has a direct anti-inflammatory effect on
      colonic tissue biopsies in vitro. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Colonic or ileal biopsies
      from 39 patients with inflammatory bowel disease and control patients were
      incubated for 24 hours with enteral diets in which nitrogen sources were amino
      acids as in elemental diet, casein or whey. Tissues were incubated with elemental
      diet, casein or whey, at dilutions of 1:5, 1:10 or 1:20 in Waymouth's complete
      medium; a medium control was also included. Tissue viability was assessed by
      bromodeoxyuridine uptake. Interleukin-1beta, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist
      and interleukin-10 concentrations in supernatants were measured by immunoassay
      (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). RESULTS: Incubation of tissues from Crohn's 
      disease with elemental diet resulted in an increase in the ratio of interleukin-1
      receptor antagonist/interleukin-1beta vs control statistically significant at
      1:10 (89.6+/-17 vs 45.7+/-9. 1, p<0.05). Incubation of Crohn's tissue with casein
      resulted in a significant increase of interleukin-1 receptor
      antagonist/interleukin-1beta ratio at dilutions 1:20, 1:10 and 1:5 (101.8+/-22.0,
      p=0.05, 142.8+/-24.6, p<0.05; 109.7+/-25.0, p=0.05). In ulcerative colitis tissue
      and non-inflamed non-inflammatory bowel disease control tissue, no significant
      increase in interleukin 1 receptor antagonist/interleukin-1beta ratio was seen
      after incubation with elemental diet, casein and whey. CONCLUSION: Elemental diet
      incubation increases anti-inflammatory:proinflammatory cytokine ratio in Crohn's 
      disease and this anti-inflammatory effect is not specifically due to amino acid
      composition, as diets containing casein have similar anti-inflammatory effects.

TI  - Nutritional factors in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 203-18
AB  - Dietary antigens may act as important stimuli of the mucosal immune system and
      have led to the study of nutritional therapy for IBD. Patients with active CD
      respond to bowel rest, along with total enteral nutrition or TPN. Bowel rest and 
      TPN are as effective as corticosteroids at inducing remission for patients with
      active CD, although benefits are short-lived. Enteral nutrition is consistently
      less effective than conventional corticosteroids for treatment of active CD. Use 
      of palatable, liquid polymeric diets in active CD is controversial, but these
      diets are of equal efficacy when compared with elemental diets. UC has not been
      treated effectively with either elemental diets or TPN. Fish oil contains
      n-3-PUFA, which inhibits production of proinflammatory cytokines and has some
      benefit in the treatment of CD. Topical applications of short-chain fatty acids
      have benefited diversion colitis and distal UC, whereas probiotics hold promise
      in the treatment of pouchitis.

TI  - Epidemiology of inflammatory bowel disease--methodological considerations.
PG  - 364-9
AB  - The causes and mechanisms of action of inflammatory bowel disease have, so far,
      eluded discovery. Epidemiological studies have shown that ulcerative colitis
      tends to level off, whereas Crohn's disease tends to increase. Some of these
      changes may be due to diagnostic practices and increasing awareness of the
      disease and Crohn's colitis. The disease varies according to geographical
      location and a distribution along a north-south axis has been suggested. The
      differences may be due to study design, or may reflect differences in lifestyle, 
      diet or be due to genetic predisposition triggered by environmental factors.
      Epidemiological studies designed to investigate such interactions may provide
      clues to its aetiology. Inflammatory bowel disease could, therefore, serve as a
      model for the importance of epidemiology when to test or reject the hypothesis of
      aetiology.

TI  - Modification of enteral diets in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 457-61
AB  - The provision of food is thought to promote the maintenance of gut integrity.
      Nutrients are able to elicit and affect both systemic and mucosal immune
      responses. Enteral diet therapy has long been known to be efficacious in
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly in childhood Crohn's disease.
      However, the mechanisms of action of these diets are not clear. Nutritional
      repletion, direct effects on the gut mucosa or decreased intestinal permeability 
      have all been postulated as being important in nutritional therapy. There is some
      evidence that the enteral diet has a direct effect on the gut mucosa by reducing 
      cytokine production and the accompanying inflammation, thus leading to decreased 
      intestinal permeability. Modifications of enteral diet composition have been
      evaluated in many studies. Such modifications include fat and/or protein content 
      and the addition of bioactive peptides. The fatty acid composition of the enteral
      diet seems to have a much greater impact on its efficacy than modification of the
      N source. As specific fatty acids are precursors of inflammatory mediators
      derived from arachidonic acid, the reduction in these components may be
      beneficial in nutritional therapy for IBD. Addition of bioactive peptides to
      enteral diet formulas may also have a role; such peptides may have specific
      growth factor or anti-inflammatory actions. There is still much work to be done
      to define disease-specific enteral diet formulas that are effective as therapies 
      for both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Ischemic colitis caused by strict dieting in an 18-year-old female: report of a
      case.
PG  - 425-8
AB  - Ischemic colitis is typically limited to elderly patients who have concomitant
      disorders such as cardiovascular disease and chronic renal failure, but rarely
      affects a young person. The patient was an 18-year-old Japanese female who
      started dieting to obtain a slim figure three months before admission and
      presented with a two-month history of constipation and a sudden onset of lower
      abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. She underwent colonoscopy, which revealed
      edema, hemorrhages, and several longitudinal shallow ulcers in the descending
      colon. Stool and blood culture results were negative for pathogens. She improved 
      rapidly within five days without any specific therapies except intravenous
      hydration and anticholinergic agents, under the diagnosis of ischemic colitis. In
      this case constipation and dehydration associated with dieting seemed to be
      responsible for the development of ischemic colitis. We recommend that ischemic
      colitis should be included in the differential diagnosis of colitis with
      bleeding, even in patients younger than age 20 who do not have any predisposing
      factors.

TI  - A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of essential fatty acid
      supplementation in the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1131-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Essential fatty acid supplementation has been found to ameliorate
      certain chronic inflammatory diseases. This effect is thought to be mediated
      through the modulation of eicosanoid synthesis. Pro-inflammatory eicosanoids have
      been implicated in ulcerative colitis. AIM: To investigate the possible
      therapeutic benefit of essential fatty acids in quiescent ulcerative colitis to
      reduce the frequency of disease relapse. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study was performed with a treatment duration of 12 months.
      Patients with quiescent disease received either trial medication (gamma-linolenic
      acid, 1.6 g, eicosapentaenoic acid, 270 mg, and docosahexaenoic acid, 45 mg, per 
      day) or placebo (sunflower oil, 500 mg/day). The primary end-point was disease
      activity, assessed by a previously validated clinical index, sigmoidoscopic
      appearance and histology. RESULTS: Sixty-three patients were randomized, 31 to
      receive essential fatty acid treatment and 32 to receive placebo. Disease relapse
      rates were similar at 12 months (placebo, 38%; essential fatty acids, 55%), as
      were changes in sigmoidoscopic grade from baseline. CONCLUSIONS: The
      supplementation of the diet with this combination of essential fatty acids does
      not prolong the period of disease remission of ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Microscopic colitis.
PG  - 236-48
AB  - Microscopic colitis is an umbrella term used to include two idiopathic
      inflammatory bowel disorders that present with chronic watery diarrhea, normal
      endoscopic findings and characteristic inflammatory changes on histology.
      Collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis are distinguished by the presence of 
      a thickened subepithelial collagen table. It is likely that they are a spectrum
      of one disease, but this is yet to be proven. The majority of cases tend to
      undergo spontaneous remission within a few years of onset, and their clinical
      course is benign, with no increase in risk of colorectal cancer. Sufficient
      evidence exists to suggest that microscopic colitis occurs as a response to one
      or more luminal antigens. A variety of medications have been reported in the
      treatment of this condition, but only colloidal bismuth and budesonide have thus 
      far been shown to be effective in randomized controlled trials.

TI  - Effect of fasting on diarrhoea in collagenous colitis.
PG  - 30-4
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Diarrhoea in collagenous colitis has been considered as secretory
      though the pathophysiology has been studied thoroughly in only a few patients.
      The result of fasting is one way to distinguish between secretory and osmotic
      diarrhoea. Our aim was to investigate the effect of fasting on diarrhoea in
      collagenous colitis. METHODS: Fourteen patients with collagenous colitis were
      admitted to the hospital for investigation. All were female. Five of these did
      not have diarrhoea during admission and were excluded. Stools were examined for
      weight, electrolytes, pH, fat and osmolality during a period on a normal diet and
      during fasting. RESULTS: During the fasting period the faecal weight was
      significantly reduced from median 757 (440-3,198) to 191 (22- 2,197) g. The
      faecal sodium concentration was also reduced, though not significantly, during
      fasting from median 65 (29-85) to 45 (19-88) mmol/l. The osmotic gaps varied
      according to the method of calculation applied. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate
      that the cause of the diarrhoea in collagenous colitis could be multifactorial.
      In some patients an osmotic factor dominates and in others a secretory factor,
      while in some patients a combination of both seems to exist.

TI  - [Information programs for patients during gastroenterological rehabilitation].
PG  - S100-S2
AB  - Patient education especially groups for patients with inflammatory bowel disease 
      belong to the typical tasks of Reha-medicine. In the Reha-Clinic "Ob der Tauber",
      Bad Mergentheim these patients are informed in special Colitis/Crohn-groups for
      eleven years now. Normally approximately ten patients with IBD are treated in our
      house at the same time. These patients participate in a nearly closed group in
      which they are taught in three weeks blocks. Three hours a week the patients are 
      informed by doctors, one hour a week a diet assistant teaches the participants.
      The psychotherapeutic group takes place regularly once a week. The aim of the
      patient information or health education is to reach a mostly complete information
      of the patients about inflammatory bowel disease, that means to inform them about
      all diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities. Another important purpose of team
      work is the support of dynamic group processes like reduction of anxiety and the 
      influence on the patients for developing an active positive attitude towards
      their disease. The participating therapist (doctors, psychotherapist,
      diet-assistant) have created a structured concept which was modified during the
      last years. Resulting from the interactive work between therapist and patients
      this concept is improved continuously. This development however is delayed by the
      shortcomming of bad personal capacities and the lack of possibilities for the
      therapist to improve their pedagogic and psychotherapeutic abilities. At the
      moment their education is based on autodidactic methods and empathy. For a
      standardization of the program including all hospitals the extended curriculum of
      the GRVS is useful. An evaluation concerning the therapeutic benefit of patient
      information has not been done yet.

TI  - [Nutrition in chronic inflammatory bowl diseases. What your patient tolerates is 
      permitted].
PG  - 40-3
AB  - Modifying the diet can have a favorable impact on the course of chronic
      inflammatory bowel disease. In contrast, nutrition plays no major role in the
      development of the disease or in provoking an acute attack. During an acute
      attack of Crohn's disease, the application of oral (drinks) or tube feeding
      (enteral nutrition) can result in a substantial clinical improvement. The
      remission rate of this side effect-free therapy is, however, lower than that seen
      with steroids. The data available for diet therapy in ulcerative colitis are less
      unequivocal, but the effects are probably slight at best. During the remission
      phase, the patient should eat a balanced, vitamin-rich and varied normal diet
      that excludes all poorly tolerated foods: lactose intolerance in particular
      appears to be increased in patients with Crohn's disease. Known vitamin or
      mineral deficiencies should be corrected by appropriate dietary measures or
      supplementation. There is no such thing as a "Crohn's diet" or "colitis diet".
      The patient can be allowed to eat anything that is tolerated.

TI  - Cow's milk protein intolerance and chronic constipation in children.
PG  - 339-42
AB  - Cow's milk protein (CMP) allergy was investigated in 25 children (age-range 3
      months to 11 years) with chronic constipation. A diagnosis of constipation was
      made on the basis of a history of painful elimination of hard stools for at least
      1 month, whether or not associated with a reduced frequency of stools or soiling.
      The children were evaluated using clinical parameters and the following
      laboratory tests: total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE); specific IgE
      (radioallergosorbent test [RAST]) for whole cow's milk, alpha-lactoalbumin,
      beta-lactoglobulin, and a food group; and skin-prick tests with whole milk,
      alpha-lactoalbumin, beta-lactoglobulin, and casein. Following the evaluation, the
      children were submitted to a CMP-free diet for a period of 4 weeks. In seven
      patients (28%), constipation disappeared during the CMP-free diet and reappeared 
      within 48-72 h following challenge with cow's milk. In two infants a rectal
      biopsy revealed allergic colitis and they therefore did not undergo the
      challenge. High serum levels of total IgE were observed in five of the children
      who showed a clinical improvement (71%), a positive skin-test in two (29%), and
      detectable specific IgE in two (29%). These results suggest that CMP allergy or
      intolerance should be considered as a cause of chronic refractory constipation in
      children, although the underlying mechanism still require further investigation.

TI  - Germinated barley foodstuff exhibits different adsorption properties for
      hydrophilic versus hydrophobic bile acids.
PG  - 248-54
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Germinated barley foodstuff (GBF), a type of dietary fiber,
      exhibits therapeutic effects in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. However, the
      precise mechanisms responsible for these effects are still under investigation.
      On the other hand, it has been suggested that bile salts in the gut lumen play an
      important role in the integrity of the intestinal mucosa. The aim of the present 
      study was to investigate the ability of GBF to adsorb bile salts in vitro.
      METHODS: The binding capacities of GBF, enzymatically digested GBF (GBF-fiber),
      and alpha-cellulose for unconjugated and conjugated bile salts were measured
      using Langmuir's method. The morphology of these fibers was observed by light and
      fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: GBF adsorbed bile salts very strongly,
      especially hydrophobic bile salts. Even after enzymatic digestion, the GBF fiber 
      still exhibited strong binding capacity, whereas alpha-cellulose exhibited very
      low binding capacity. Microscopically, GBF consists mainly of aleurone, a
      lattice-like cell wall with cytoplasm enclosed. After enzymatic digestion, the
      cytoplasm was also digested. CONCLUSION: GBF possesses a great capacity to adsorb
      bile salts. This may be part of the mechanism for the therapeutic effects of GBF 
      in UC patients.

TI  - Antiendomysium antibodies in Brazilian patients with celiac disease and their
      first-degree relatives.
PG  - 94-103
AB  - BACKGROUND: Literature data have shown high specificity of antiendomysial
      antibodies (EmA IgA) in celiac disease. The scarcity of Brazilian reports
      concerning this subject motivated the present study. OBJECTIVES: To determine the
      sensitivity and specificity of antiendomysial IgA antibodies in Brazilian celiac 
      patients at diagnosis and after treatment, to confirm patient adherence to a
      gluten-free diet and to screen first-degree relatives. METHODS: An extensive
      clinical and serological study was performed by investigating the presence of
      these antibodies in 392 individuals from Southern Brazil. Indirect
      immunofluorescence using human umbilical cord as substrate was employed and the
      total levels of IgA were determined by turbidimetry in all groups. The study was 
      conducted on 57 celiac patients (18 at diagnosis, 24 who adhered to a gluten-free
      diet and 15 with marked or slight transgression of the diet), 115 relatives of
      celiac patients (39 families), 94 patients with other gastrointestinal diseases, 
      and 126 healthy individuals from the general population. RESULTS: The results
      demonstrated 100% positivity for the recently diagnosed patients and for those
      consuming gluten, in contrast to the patients who complied with the diet (0%). In
      the control group one individual was positive, but refused to undergo a biopsy.
      In the group of other gastrointestinal diseases, one positive patient presented
      ulcerative colitis, Down's syndrome and epilepsy, and the intestinal biopsy was
      diagnostic for celiac disease. These data showed 99.3% specificity for the test. 
      Eighteen relatives were positive for antiendomysial antibodies IgA (15.65%), and 
      comparison with the healthy population revealed a significant difference. An
      intestinal biopsy was obtained from seven subjects (one with total villous
      atrophy and six without alterations in the mucosal architecture, but all with a
      high number of intra-epithelial lymphocytes). CONCLUSIONS: The method revealed
      100% sensitivity and 99.3% specificity. Because it is not an invasive method it
      can be used for the screening of atypical and latent forms of celiac disease to
      avoid serial biopsies and to control adherence to a gluten-free diet with
      implications in the prevention of malignancy in celiac disease.

TI  - Quality of life after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis: an evaluation of diet and
      other factors using the Cleveland Global Quality of Life instrument.
PG  - 30-8
AB  - PURPOSE: Although functional results after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis are
      excellent, imperfections of function do occur. In this setting, quality-of-life
      assessment is an invaluable tool in determining overall therapeutic efficacy. We 
      evaluated the impact of dietary restrictions, preoperative diagnosis (ulcerative 
      colitis vs. familial adenomatous polyposis), and pregnancy (after pouch
      insertion) on quality of life. METHODS: After ethical approval, 64 patients were 
      reviewed (mean age, 31 (range, 15-54) years). Long-term quality of life in
      patients after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis was assessed using the Cleveland
      Global Quality of Life instrument or Fazio score. The Cleveland Global Quality of
      Life score is a novel quality-of-life instrument specifically designed for
      patients with ileal pouches. Stool frequency and continence were recorded to
      establish the functional status of this group. RESULTS: Sixty-one patients (95.3 
      percent) complained of some form of dietary restriction and adopted a fixed
      dietary regimen. All such patients felt that a breach of this regimen would
      impinge significantly on their quality of life. Late eating and alcohol were
      associated with diarrhea, whereas smoking was not. Constipation was infrequently 
      reported. The mean Cleveland Global Quality of Life score of patients with
      ulcerative colitis (0.81 +/- 0.13) was greater than that of patients with
      ulcerative colitis and a background of pouchitis (0.78 +/- 0.16; P = 0.042).
      Whereas postoperative stool frequency in patients with familial adenomatous
      polyposis was always higher than the preoperative level (4 vs. 2 movements per
      day; P = 0.04), the Cleveland Global Quality of Life score of this group was
      lower than that of ulcerative colitis patients (0.77 vs. 0.81; P = 0.047). The
      Cleveland Global Quality of Life score of females who had had pregnancies after
      pouch formation was 0.70, significantly lower (P = 0.039) than that of ulcerative
      colitis patients, although pouch function was similar to the general group (7 vs.
      6 daily bowel movements with full continence in all parous patients).
      CONCLUSIONS: Most patients suffered dietary restrictions, forcing them to adopt a
      fixed dietary regimen. Breach of this regimen would impact on their quality of
      life. Hence composition of diet and timing of intake are important determinants
      of quality of life after ileal pouch formation. Patients with familial
      adenomatous polyposis and those with a history of pouchitis had poorer Cleveland 
      Global Quality of Life scores than ulcerative colitis patients without a
      background of pouchitis. This indicates that they also had poorer quality of
      life. Parous patients had the lowest Cleveland Global Quality of Life scores,
      indicating the poorest quality of life. These differences did not correlate with 
      poorer pouch function, highlighting the influence of non-pouch-related factors in
      quality of life after ileal pouch formation.

TI  - Treatment of inflammatory bowel disease in childhood.
PG  - 48-50
AB  - Of all patients with Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis, the first presentation
      of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is at a paediatric or adolescent age in 20%
      to 30%, most children being prepubertal at diagnosis. It is essential to provide 
      an accurate diagnosis in children suspected of IBD, as the initial treatment of
      Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis in children is not the same as it is in
      adults. While the role of enteral feeding in the treatment of Crohn disease in
      adults continues to be controversial, there is firm evidence to support the use
      of enteral feeding as primary therapy for Crohn disease in children. Nutrition is
      improved by enteral feeding, and growth and pubertal development are promoted,
      while the systemic toxicity of corticosteroid therapy is avoided. Supplementary
      nocturnal enteral nutrition (with daytime intake of normal diet) after primary
      therapy and remission induction may be associated with the prolongation of
      remission. Drug treatment in children with IBD is characterized by a lack of
      evidence from controlled trials.

TI  - Reduced plasma antioxidant concentrations and increased oxidative DNA damage in
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1289-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress is believed to play a key role in the pathogenesis
      of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-related intestinal damage. Circulating
      antioxidants may have a role to play in preventing free radical-mediated tissue
      injury. METHODS: Plasma vitamin A, E and carotenoid concentrations, leukocytic
      genomic damage and 8-hydroxy-deoxy-guanosine (8-OHdG) concentration were
      determined in 46 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, 37 Crohn disease (CD) patients
      and 386 controls. A 20 ml blood sample was taken from each subject for
      antioxidant and 8-OHdG measurements. A food frequency questionnaire was
      administered to a sample of subjects from each group to evaluate daily intake of 
      dietary compounds. RESULTS: Antioxidant concentration was significantly reduced
      in IBD patients, particularly in those with active disease, with respect to
      controls (P < 0.0001). 8-OHdG concentrations were significantly increased in IBD 
      patients compared to controls, independent of disease activity (P < 0.05). No
      correlation was found between antioxidant and 8-OHdG concentrations. Carotenoid
      concentrations were significantly reduced in malnourished IBD patients (0.89 +/- 
      0.14 micromol/l) compared to patients with normal or high body mass index (1.83
      +/- 0.12 micromol/l; P < 0.05), independent of disease activity or extension.
      Protein, fruit and vegetable intakes of IBD patients were significantly lower
      than those of controls. CONCLUSIONS: Depletion of antioxidants is likely to be
      important in the pathophysiology of IBD: UC and CD patients show increased free
      radical peripheral leukocyte DNA damage and decreased plasma antioxidant
      defenses. These results indicate the necessity of further studies to establish
      whether optimal vitamin status may improve the clinical course of UC and CD.

TI  - [Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies in patients with Crohn's disease].
PG  - 2303-7
AB  - Inflammatory Bowel Diseases are a group of diseases with chronic inflammation of 
      the gastrointestinal tract, but without proven etiology. Immunologic,
      environmental, infective and genetic factors equally can play role in their
      development. Antibodies to an oligomannose epitope of the Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae demonstrated in 60-70% of the patients with Crohn's disease. The
      origin and the clinicopathological role are not clarified. It is important that
      there are no surveys with patients suffering in gluten sensitive enteropathy in
      the literature. As there are no ASCA survey in Hungary, the aim of this study was
      to determine the prevalence of the ASCA. The authors examined at their patients
      the ASCA's occurrence and compared with the clinical picture of the Crohn's
      disease. The results supported the theory that ASCA positivity correlates with
      small intestines' Crohn's disease and in these cases both the IgG and IgA type
      antibodies proved. The antibodies in the sera at the analyzed ASCA positive cases
      prove a systemic immune response against Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the authors
      suggest the end of the oral tolerance against the yeast's antigens. The diet
      restriction (elemental diet, total parenteral nutrition, and fecal diversion) may
      ameliorate the status of the patients with Crohn's disease. It is speculated that
      the yeast-free diet as a part of the therapy for the ASCA positive patients can
      be reasonable: moreover the permanent "forbidding" of the yeast can be an
      acceptable alternative in case of getting well.

TI  - Collagenous gastritis associated with lymphocytic gastritis and celiac disease.
PG  - 1579-84
AB  - Collagenous gastritis is a rare disorder, with only 8 cases reported in the
      literature, 2 in children and 6 in adults. We report an additional case of
      collagenous gastritis in a 42-year-old man with celiac disease. A thickened (>10 
      microm) subepithelial collagen band with entrapped capillaries, fibroblasts, and 
      inflammatory cells was seen in the stomach, associated with lymphocytic
      gastritis. The duodenal mucosa showed severe villous atrophy but no subepithelial
      collagen deposition. No evidence of lymphocytic or collagenous colitis was found 
      in the colon. The patient became symptom-free on a gluten exclusion diet and
      showed partial improvement of histopathologic findings after 3 months.
      Collagenous gastritis is a rare disease, but a wider recognition of its
      histopathologic features and clinical associations may bring more cases to light 
      and provide additional clues in determining its etiology and pathogenesis.

TI  - Nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 561-9
AB  - Nutritional derangements are frequent in inflammatory bowel disease. In the past 
      year significant work has been published examining the mechanisms of impaired
      food intake in animal models of inflammatory bowel disease, which allow a better 
      understanding of these processes. Data from the same laboratory have shed further
      light on the relative role of underfeeding and inflammation on the growth
      retardation associated with intestinal inflammation. Other studies have provided 
      further data on the risk factors and predictive biomarkers of bone loss in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The potential role of enteral nutrition
      as primary therapy for Crohn's disease is particularly addressed in this review. 
      Recent contributions to the field emphasized the special importance of this
      modality of therapy in paediatric patients. The possible mechanisms for such a
      therapeutic action are not well understood. Other nutrients may have a
      therapeutic potential in inflammatory bowel disease. In particular, recent data
      on the in-vivo anti-inflammatory actions of butyrate merit special mention.
      Finally, novel nutritional therapeutic strategies for inflammatory bowel disease,
      such as transforming growth factor-beta2-enriched enteral feeding, or
      hydrothermally processed cereals have recently been explored.

PG  - 323-6
AB  - We present the case of dual adult celiac disease and liver disease with portal
      hypertension (esophageal varices); a percutaneous liver biopsy was compatible
      with nonspecific reactive hepatitis. Clinically, celiac disease was characterised
      by poor response to a gluten-free diet, with the development of a biochemical
      cholestasis and marked malnutrition. Our patient died of cerebral hemorrhage, at 
      the age of 50 years, without associated risk factors. The necropsy demonstrated
      the existence of a nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver, splenic
      atrophy, gelatinous transformation of the bone marrow, and lymphocytic colitis.
      We discuss the different types of liver disorders associated with celiac disease 
      and the possible relation between nodular regenerative hyperplasia and celiac
      disease, based on immunologic mechanisms.

      fructans on caecal, colonic and faecal short-chain fatty acid concentration and
      microflora composition depend on their chain length. Germ-free rats associated
      with a human faecal flora were randomly assigned to one of four treatments as
      follows: (1) commercial standard diet as a control (Con); (2) Con+50 g
      short-chain oligofructose/kg (OF); (3) C+50 g long-chain inulin/kg (lcIN); or (4)
      Con+50 g OF-lcIN/kg (Mix OF-lcIN). Changes in bacterial population groups in
      response to feeding these diets were investigated with 16S rRNA-targeted probes
      applied in in situ hybridization. Mix OF-lcIN- and lcIN-containing diets resulted
      in larger numbers of caecal, colonic and faecal bacteria of the Clostridium
      coccoides-Eubacterium rectale cluster than Con (10.6 and 10.3 v. 9.5 log10/g wet 
      wt), whereas OF alone did not affect this bacterial group in caecum, colon or
      faeces. A bifidogenic effect was only observed in the colon and faeces of
      OF-treated rats. More lactobacilli were found in caecal and colonic contents of
      Mix OF-lcIN-fed rats and in faeces of OF-fed rats compared with Con. Mix OF-lcIN 
      and OF led to significantly smaller numbers of caecal, colonic and faecal
      bacteria belonging to the Clostridium histolyticum and C. lituseburense groups
      than Con (6.8 and 6.9 v. 7.9 log10/g wet wt). Counts of total bacteria,
      Bacteroides-Prevotella and Enterobacteriaceae did not differ between the groups. 
      OF and/or lcIN-containing diets significantly increased the caecal and colonic
      concentration of butyrate and its relative molar proportion. Only lcIN-containing
      diets resulted in a higher faecal concentration of butyrate than Con. Higher
      molar proportions of faecal butyrate were observed with all diets that had been
      supplemented with OF and/or lcIN. Stimulation of butyrate production could be of 
      interest for the prevention of ulcerative colitis and colon cancer.

TI  - Brain white-matter lesions in celiac disease: a prospective study of 75
      diet-treated patients.
PG  - E21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease (CD), or gluten sensitivity, is considered to be a
      state of heightened immunologic responsiveness to ingested gluten proteins in
      genetically predisposed individuals. The gastrointestinal manifestation suggests 
      a severe enteropathy of the small intestine with malabsorption, steatorrhea, and 
      weight loss because of a deranged mucosal immune response. Neurologic
      complications occur, especially epilepsy, possibly associated with occipital
      calcifications or folate deficiency and cerebellar ataxia. There have been
      reports of brain white-matter lesions as an extraintestinal manifestation in
      Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis but not in CD. METHODS: In this study, 75
      diet-treated mainly pediatric patients with biopsy-proven CD underwent
      prospectively clinical neurologic examinations, laboratory investigations,
      electroencephalography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. The 
      age range was 2.8 to 24.2 years with a mean of 11.6 years. The mean period of
      gluten exposure was 2.4 years. RESULTS: Ten patients had neurologic findings such
      as febrile seizures, single generalized seizures, mild ataxia, and muscular
      hypotonia with retarded motor development. No folate deficiency was found. The
      hippocampal regions showed no abnormalities. Computed tomography did not reveal
      any cerebral calcifications, but magnetic resonance imaging detected unilateral
      and bilateral T2-hyperintensive white-matter lesions in 15 patients (20%). There 
      was no correlation between these lesions and dietary compliance or neurologic or 
      electroencephalographic abnormalities. The mean gluten exposure time of these
      patients was slightly increased (not significant). CONCLUSIONS: Focal
      white-matter lesions in the brain may represent an extraintestinal manifestation 
      of CD. They may be ischemic in origin as a result of a vasculitis or caused by
      inflammatory demyelination. They seem to be more typical of pediatric CD than
      cerebral calcifications. Their prognostic value is unclear and needs to be
      elucidated in additional studies. CD should be suggested as a differential
      diagnosis in children with unclear white-matter lesions even without intestinal
      symptoms.

TI  - Experience with the ketogenic diet in infants.
PG  - 129-33
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness, tolerability, and adverse effects of
      the ketogenic diet in infants with refractory epilepsy. METHODS: A retrospective 
      review of 32 infants who had been treated with the ketogenic diet at a large
      metropolitan institution. RESULTS: Most infants (71%) were able to maintain
      strong ketosis. The overall effectiveness of the diet in infants was similar to
      that reported in the literature for older children; 19.4% became seizure-free,
      and an additional 35.5% had >50% reduction in seizure frequency. The diet was
      particularly effective for patients with infantile spasms/myoclonic seizures.
      There were concomitant reductions in antiepileptic medications. The majority of
      parents reported improvements in seizure frequency and in their child's behavior 
      and function, particularly with respect to attention/alertness, activity level,
      and socialization. The diet generally was well-tolerated, and 96.4% maintained
      appropriate growth parameters. Adverse events, all reversible and occurring in
      one patient each, included renal stone, gastritis, ulcerative colitis, alteration
      of mentation, and hyperlipidemia. CONCLUSION: The ketogenic diet should be
      considered safe and effective treatment for infants with intractable seizures.

TI  - Advantages of laparoscopic resection for ileocolic Crohn's disease. Improved
      outcomes and reduced costs.
PG  - 450-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic colorectal procedures are considered to be technically
      challenging, and there is a lack of consensus regarding the magnitude of their
      benefits. The laparoscopic approach is generally held to be more expensive. Using
      a model of a single procedure performed for a single indication (ileocolic
      resection for Crohn's disease [CD]), we set out to demonstrate the feasibility of
      this procedure by determining the conversion rate, documenting the patient
      benefits, and performing a formal cost analysis. METHODS: Consecutive cases of
      laparoscopic ileocolic resection for CD were identified (LAP). Case-match
      methodology identified a series of open laparotomy controls (OPEN) that were
      matched for five potential confounding criteria: age, gender, diagnosis, type of 
      resection, and date of operation. Pre-, intra-, and postoperative details were
      gathered. Medical resource utilization was tracked using a standardized database,
      and all costs were reported in 1999 dollars. RESULTS: The conversion rate was
      5.9%. Resolution of ileus occurred more rapidly in the LAP than in the OPEN
      group. The time to clears in the LAP group was a median of 0 days (range, 0-4) vs
      3.0 days (range, 2-8) in the OPEN group (p = 0.0001). Time to regular diet was
      2.0 days (range, 1-6) in the LAP group vs 5.0 days (range, 3-12) in the OPEN
      group (p = 0.0001). Length of hospital stay was significantly reduced in the LAP 
      group (4.0 days [range, 2-8], vs 7.0 days [range, 3-14], p = 0.0001). The LAP
      group had significantly lower direct costs ($8684 vs $11,373) and indirect costs 
      ($1358 vs $2349) than the OPEN group (p < 0.001). This resulted in total costs of
      $9895 for LAP vs $13,268 for OPEN (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic ileocolic
      resection for CD is feasible. There are significant postoperative benefits in
      terms of resolution of ileus, narcotic use, and hospital stay. This approach
      translates into cost savings of >$3300 for laparoscopic patients.

TI  - A review of recent clinical trials of the nutritional supplement Chlorella
      pyrenoidosa in the treatment of fibromyalgia, hypertension, and ulcerative
      colitis.
PG  - 79-91
AB  - CONTEXT: It has been suggested that the consumption of natural "whole foods" rich
      in macronutrients has many healthful benefits for those who otherwise ingest a
      normal, nonvegetarian diet. One example is dietary supplements derived from
      Chlorella pyrenoidosa, a unicellular fresh water green alga rich in proteins,
      vitamins, and minerals. OBJECTIVE: To find evidence of the potential of chlorella
      dietary supplements to relieve signs and symptoms, improve quality of life, and
      normalize body functions in people with chronic illnesses, specifically
      fibromyalgia, hypertension, and ulcerative colitis. DESIGN: Double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials. SETTING: Virginia Commonwealth
      University's Medical College of Virginia. PATIENTS: Fifty-five subjects with
      fibromyalgia, 33 with hypertension, and 9 with ulcerative colitis. INTERVENTION: 
      Subjects consumed 10 g of pure chlorella in tablet form and 100 mL of a liquid
      containing an extract of chlorella each day for 2 or 3 months. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURES: For fibromyalgia patients, assessments of pain and overall quality of
      life. For hypertensive patients, measurements of sitting diastolic blood pressure
      and serum lipid levels. For patients with ulcerative colitis, determination of
      state of disease using the Disease Activity Index. RESULTS: Daily dietary
      supplementation with chlorella may reduce high blood pressure, lower serum
      cholesterol levels, accelerate wound healing, and enhance immune functions.
      CONCLUSIONS: The potential of chlorella to relieve symptoms, improve quality of
      life, and normalize body functions in patients with fibromyalgia, hypertension,
      or ulcerative colitis suggests that larger, more comprehensive clinical trials of
      chlorella are warranted.

TI  - Beneficial health effects of low-digestible carbohydrate consumption.
PG  - S23-30
AB  - Low-digestible carbohydrates represent a class of enzyme-resistant saccharides
      that have specific effects on the human gastrointestinal tract. in the small
      bowel, they affect nutrient digestion and absorption, glucose and lipid
      metabolism and protect against known risk factors of cardiovascular disease. In
      the colon they are mainly degraded by anaerobic bacteria in a process called
      fermentation. As a consequence, faecal nitrogen excretion is enhanced, which is
      used clinically to prevent or treat hepatic encephalopathy. Low-digestible
      carbohydrates are trophic to the epithelia of the ileum and colon, which helps to
      avoid bacterial translocation. Short-chain fatty acids are important fermentation
      products and are evaluated as new therapeutics in acute colitis. They are
      considered in the primary prevention of colorectal cancer. The bifidogenic effect
      of fructo-oligosaccharides merits further attention, Unfermented carbohydrates
      increase faecal bulk and play a role in the treatment of chronic functional
      constipation, symptomatic diverticulosis and, possibly, the irritable bowel
      syndrome. In conclusion, low-digestible carbohydrates may play a role in the
      maintenance of human digestive health. However, the strength of evidence differs 
      between disease entities.

TI  - Consecutive series of laparoscopic-assisted vs. minilaparotomy restorative
      proctocolectomies.
PG  - 397-400
AB  - PURPOSE: Compared with open restorative proctocolectomy, laparoscopic procedures 
      may reduce postoperative recovery times and give a more cosmetically acceptable
      scar, but operative time may be prolonged. We describe a minilaparotomy technique
      for restorative proctocolectomy and compare recovery parameters with a
      laparoscopic procedure. METHODS: A consecutive series of patients undergoing
      laparoscopic-assisted restorative proctocolectomy were compared with a subsequent
      consecutive series of patients undergoing a minilaparotomy procedure. This method
      incorporates a suprapubic incision. Mobilization of the colon is performed in the
      usual manner with visualization of less accessible areas made possible by using
      an illuminated St. Mark's retractor. Operative and recovery parameters were
      analyzed for each group retrospectively. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were
      compared (12 in the laparoscopic group). Wound length was significantly longer in
      the open group (median, 14 vs. 8.5 cm; P < 0.01), but operative times were
      shorter (median, 120 vs. 150 minutes; P < 0.01). There were no differences in any
      of the recovery parameters analyzed, including analgesic requirements, time to
      ileostomy function, first fluid intake, time to solid diet, length of hospital
      stay, and complications. CONCLUSION: The only advantage of a
      laparoscopic-assisted procedure over a minilaparotomy technique was the size of
      the wound. The minilaparotomy restorative proctocolectomy achieves the same
      postoperative recovery parameters and has a shorter operative time. This
      technique is recommended for surgeons less experienced in laparoscopy.

TI  - Proctocolitis in breast fed infants: a contribution to differential diagnosis of 
      haematochezia in early childhood.
PG  - 252-4
AB  - Dietary protein induced proctocolitis in exclusively breast fed infants is rarely
      taken into consideration as a cause of rectal bleeding or blood streaked stool in
      the neonatal period and early infancy. Eleven babies are presented in whom it is 
      believed that bleeding through the rectum was due to proctocolitis as a result of
      allergy triggered by cows' milk protein transferred to the infants via the breast
      milk. Colonoscopy was performed in five infants, revealing benign eosinophilic
      proctocolitis. Standard treatment was the exclusion of the allergen from the
      mother's diet. Resolution of visible rectal bleeding took place within 72 to 96
      hours after elimination of the offending protein from the mother's diet.

TI  - Intestinal luminal pH in inflammatory bowel disease: possible determinants and
      implications for therapy with aminosalicylates and other drugs.
PG  - 571-7
AB  - Measurements of luminal pH in the normal gastrointestinal tract have shown a
      progressive increase in pH from the duodenum to the terminal ileum, a decrease in
      the caecum, and then a slow rise along the colon to the rectum. Some data in
      patients with ulcerative colitis suggest a substantial reduction below normal
      values in the right colon, while limited results in Crohn's disease have been
      contradictory. Determinants of luminal pH in the colon include mucosal
      bicarbonate and lactate production, bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates and
      mucosal absorption of short chain fatty acids, and possibly intestinal transit.
      Alterations in these factors, as a result of mucosal disease and changes in diet,
      are likely to explain abnormal pH measurements in inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD). It is conceivable that reduced intracolonic pH in active ulcerative
      colitis impairs bioavailability of 5-aminosalicylic acid from pH dependent
      release formulations (Asacol, Salofalk) and those requiring cleavage by bacterial
      azo reductase (sulphasalazine, olsalazine, balsalazide), but further
      pharmacokinetic studies are needed to confirm this possibility. Reports that
      balsalazide and olsalazine may be more efficacious in active and quiescent
      ulcerative colitis, respectively, than Asacol suggest that low pH may be a more
      critical factor in patients taking directly pH dependent release than azo bonded 
      preparations. Reduced intracolonic pH also needs to be considered in the
      development of pH dependent colonic release formulations of budesonide and
      azathioprine for use in ulcerative and Crohn's colitis. This paper reviews
      methods for measuring gut pH, its changes in IBD, and how these may influence
      current and future therapies.

TI  - IgA cross-reactivity between a nuclear autoantigen and wheat proteins suggests
      molecular mimicry as a possible pathomechanism in celiac disease.
PG  - 918-28
AB  - Celiac disease patients display IgA antibody reactivity to wheat as well as to
      human proteins. We used serum IgA from celiac patients and, for control purposes,
      from patients with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and from healthy
      individuals to identify celiac disease-specific IgA autoantigens in
      nitrocellulose-blotted extracts from various human cell types (epithelial,
      endothelial, intestinal cells, fibroblasts). The pattern, recognition intensity
      and time course of IgA autoreactivity was monitored using serial serum samples
      obtained from celiac children before and under gluten-free diet. By immunoblot
      inhibition and subcellular (cytosolic, nuclear) cell fractionation we identified 
      a 55 kDa nuclear autoantigen expressed in intestinal, endothelial cells and in
      fibroblasts which was recognized by IgA antibodies of approximately half of the
      celiac disease patients and cross-reacted with wheat proteins. IgA reactivity to 
      the 55 kDa autoantigen disappeared during gluten-free diet and was inhibited
      after pre-absorption of sera with wheat proteins but not with tissue
      transglutaminase, previously reported as the unique celiac disease-specific
      autoantigen. In conclusion, we defined a novel 55 kDa celiac disease-specific
      nuclear IgA autoantigen which shares epitopes with wheat proteins and which is
      different from tissue transglutaminase and calreticulin. Although the newly
      defined autoantigen was recognized much less frequently than tissue
      transglutaminase, our data suggest molecular mimicry between wheat and human
      proteins as a possible pathomechanism for the induction and/or maintenance of
      mucosal tissue damage in celiac disease.

TI  - [Collagen gastritis, an unusual cause of anemia in children. Report of 2 cases].
PG  - 47-50
AB  - UNLABELLED: When a child presents a severe anemia or resistant to iron
      supplementation, an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy has to be realized to find
      special causes. CASE REPORTS: We report observations of two patients,
      respectively 11 and 12 years old, who were admitted to hospital for a severe
      microcytic, hypochromic, aregenerative anemia (hemoglobin less than 50 g/L) due
      to an iron deficiency. The two children's history did not reveal a deficient
      diet, gastrointestinal tract disorder, ingested toxic or gastrotoxic drugs, or
      exteriorized hemorrhage. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed a macroscopic
      pattern of gastritis. The stomach biopsies revealed subepithelial collagenous
      deposits. CONCLUSION: The collagenous gastritis involves lesions similar to those
      described in the small intestine (collagenous sprue) and colon (collagenous
      colitis). The pathogenic factors of the three entities are presently unknown, but
      they are often associated with autoimmune pathology. These two observations are
      the third and the fourth pediatric cases described.
