TI  - [Eosinophilic colitis. A report of two cases with non conventional treatment].
PG  - 231-5
AB  - Eosinophilic colitis is a rare entity of unknown etiology characterized by
      diarrhea, abdominal pain, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Diagnosis includes
      histopathological infiltration of more than 20 eosinophils in colon. It is
      frequently associated with milk hypersensitivity and, less usual, with other
      foods and increased IgE. Histopthological appearance of eosinophil mediators has 
      been observed in the gut. It is sometimes related to the degree of infiltration
      of eosinophils in the gut as well as to the disease severity. There is not an
      established treatment for this entity, although systemic steroids have been used 
      with certain efficacy. However, there is a recurrence of the symptoms when the
      therapy stops, besides the well known side effects of the long-term use of
      steroids. Cromolyn inhibits mast cell degranulation and prevents liberation of
      mediators. It is successful in certain cases, specially the severe ones. However,
      it is not available for its use in our country. Ketotifen, as last resource in
      our patients with bad response to habitual treatment and restriction diet, was
      used. Although its use is controversial, we consider that stabilizing mast cell
      membrane with subsequent inhibition of degranulation and recruitment of
      eosinophils to sites of inflammation, would also restrain histamine liberation
      and blockage of H1 receptors, which would diminish local damage induced by
      eosinophils. Nonetheless ketotifen mechanism of action is unknown, our patients
      improved after treatment with this drug.

TI  - [Aspects of the children's candidiasis in outpatient practice].
PG  - 151-4
AB  - Candidiasis are conditions caused by fungi from Candida genus. The most
      frequently involved in humans pathology is Candida albicans, which, even if is in
      balance with endogenous bacterial flora, became pathogenic in certain conditions.
      The hereby study aims to evaluate retrospectively on a period of 5 years
      (1999-2003), an group of 101,000 children aged 14 days-18 years, the prevalence
      of candidiasis, the clinical aspects determined in pediatric population diagnosed
      and treated in the paediatric offices of the outpatient clinic of "Sf. Spiridon" 
      Hospital, as well as the risk factors of these diseases. From 3806 positive
      samples for Candida, 2650 (69%) have presented signs of pathogenicity of a
      significant intensity of colonization. 65% of samples have been observed in
      female gender, 35% in male gender, 58% of cases from urban areas, 42% from rural 
      environment. The concordance of the lab results having significant values with
      the manifest clinical symptoms was 85% for the nasal and pharyngeal exudates; 93%
      for the examination of the stools and 95% for vaginal secretions. The most
      frequent clinical aspects were oropharyngeal candidiasis (39%), mycotic
      esopharyngitis (0.4%), enterocolitis (15%), mycotic colitis (22%), vulvovaginitis
      (25%). The most frequent risk factors for the appearance of candidiasis have been
      repeated or prolonged antibiotic treatments (90% of cases), diabetes mellitus
      (0.3% cases), steroid therapy (0.2% cases), deficient hygiene (5% cases), diet
      rich in carbohydrates (9%). This study confirm that Candida albicans can become
      pathogenic producing signs and symptoms of disease in certain conditions, the
      most important factor being prolonged or repeated antibiotic treatment.

TI  - Spontaneous mucosal lymphocyte cytokine profiles in children with autism and
      gastrointestinal symptoms: mucosal immune activation and reduced counter
      regulatory interleukin-10.
PG  - 664-73
AB  - A lymphocytic enterocolitis has been reported in a cohort of children with
      autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. This study
      tested the hypothesis that dysregulated intestinal mucosal immunity with enhanced
      pro-inflammatory cytokine production is present in these ASD children. Comparison
      was made with developmentally normal children with, and without, mucosal
      inflammation. Duodenal and colonic biopsies were obtained from 21 ASD children,
      and 65 developmentally normal paediatric controls, of which 38 had signs of
      histological inflammation. Detection of CD3+ lymphocyte staining for spontaneous 
      intracellular TNFalpha, IL-2, IL-4, IFNgamma, and IL-10, was performed by
      multicolor flow cytometry. Duodenal and colonic mucosal CD3+ lymphocyte counts
      were elevated in ASD children compared with noninflamed controls (p<0.03). In the
      duodenum, the proportion of lamina propria (LP) and epithelial CD3(+)TNFalpha+
      cells in ASD children was significantly greater compared with noninflamed
      controls (p<0.002) but not coeliac disease controls. In addition, LP and
      epithelial CD3(+)IL-2+ and CD3(+)IFNgamma+, and epithelial CD3(+)IL-4+ cells were
      more numerous in ASD children than in noninflamed controls (p<0.04). In contrast,
      CD3(+)IL-10+ cells were fewer in ASD children than in noninflamed controls
      (p<0.05). In the colon, LP CD3(+)TNFalpha+ and CD3(+)IFNgamma+ were more frequent
      in ASD children than in noninflamed controls (p<0.01). In contrast with Crohn's
      disease and non-Crohn's colitis, LP and epithelial CD3(+)IL-10+ cells were fewer 
      in ASD children than in nondisease controls (p<0.01). There was a significantly
      greater proportion of CD3(+)TNFalpha+ cells in colonic mucosa in those ASD
      children who had no dietary exclusion compared with those on a gluten and/or
      casein free diet (p<0.05). There is a consistent profile of CD3+ lymphocyte
      cytokines in the small and large intestinal mucosa of these ASD children,
      involving increased pro-inflammatory and decreased regulatory activities. The
      data provide further evidence of a diffuse mucosal immunopathology in some ASD
      children and the potential for benefit of dietary and immunomodulatory therapies.

TI  - [Environmental factors in the etiopathology of inflammatory bowel syndrome].
PG  - 97-105
AB  - Inflammatory bowel syndrome (IBS) mainly includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and
      Crohn's disease (CD). UC and CD are chronic and recurrent conditions, with a
      tendency to exacerbations and remissions. The incidence of diseases worldwide has
      increased over the last years. Although the etiology of inflammatory bowel
      syndrome has been studied intensively it still remains unclear. The development
      and persistence of inflammation is an effect of numerous factors: proinflammatory
      (aggressive), regulating bowel mucosa homeostasis and protective factors.
      Proinflammatory factors include intestinal bacteria, bile acids, digestive
      enzymes, lipopolysaccharides and peptidoglycans. Protective mechanisms are
      impermeability of mucosa barrier, presence of intestinal mucus, activity of
      secretive immunoglobulins, some prostaglandins and interleukins, glutamine,
      somatostatin, cortisol and short-chain fatty acids. Factors modifying intestinal 
      mucosa homeostasis consist of genetically determined immunoregulators and
      activity of intestinal mucosa barrier and some environmental factors (diet,
      smoking, infections, stress, antibiotics and others). Environmental factors are
      jointly responsible for IBS occurrence in case of genetically determined
      dysregulation leading to proinflammatory cytokines overproduction or disturbances
      in synthesis of cytokines regulating intestinal mucosa homeostasis.

TI  - Reduced joint pain after short-term duodenal administration of seal oil in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease: comparison with soy oil.
PG  - 1088-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rheumatic joint pain is a common extra-intestinal complication of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Because the high ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty
      acids (FAs) of the Western diet might promote rheumatic disorders, we sought to
      compare the effects of short-term duodenal administration of n-3-rich seal oil
      and n-6-rich soy oil on IBD-related joint pain. METHODS: Nineteen patients with
      IBD-related joint pain were included in the study; 9 had Crohn disease and 10 had
      ulcerative colitis. Ten millilitres seal oil (n = 10) or soy oil (n = 9) was
      self-administered through a nasoduodenal feeding tube 3 times daily for 10 days. 
      RESULTS: Compared with soy oil treatment, seal oil significantly reduced the
      duration of morning stiffness (P = 0.024), number of tender joints (P = 0.035),
      intensity of pain (P = 0.025) and the doctor's scoring of rheumatic disease
      activity (P = 0.025) at the end of the 10-day treatment period. Analysis of the
      effects as area under the curve (area between the curve and baseline, zero) for
      the entire period from start of treatment until 6 months' post-treatment
      suggested a long-lasting beneficial effect of seal oil administration on joint
      pain, whereas soy oil tended (not significantly) to aggravate the condition.
      Consistently, the serum ratios of n-6 to n-3 FAs (P < 0.01) and arachidonic acid 
      to eicosapentaenoic acid (P < 0.01) were reduced after treatment with seal oil.
      CONCLUSION: The results suggest distinctive, differential prolonged effects on
      IBD-related joint pain of short-term duodenal administration of n-3-rich seal oil
      (significant improvement) and n-6-rich soy oil (tendency to exacerbation).

PG  - 458-61
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to analyse the outcome of restorative
      proctocolectomy carried out by laparoscopic surgery. METHODS: A prospectively
      collected electronic database of all colorectal laparoscopic procedures performed
      between April 2001 and July 2003 has been used to identify surgical outcomes in
      14 consecutive patients who have undergone laparoscopic RPC. RESULTS: Fourteen
      patients (5 male), median BMI 24 kg/m(2) have undergone restorative laparoscopic 
      proctocolectomy over a two year period: 13 (ulcerative colitis, one with cancer) 
      and 1 (FAP). The median operation time was 260 min; time has not decreased with
      experience. There were no intra-operative surgical complications or deaths.
      Patient controlled analgesia continued for a median of 36 h. The median time to
      diet was 48 h and median hospital stay 7 days; three patients required
      nasogastric aspiration for delayed gastric emptying. Eighteen regional lymph
      nodes were retrieved local to the carcinoma. There was one anastomotic leak. All 
      covering stomas were closed by 6 months (12 by eight weeks). All 14 patients are 
      fully continent, able to suppress urgency and have a median pouch frequency of
      4/24 h. None admit to having problems with potency, orgasm sensation,
      ejaculation, micturition. One lady reports dysparunia. All are highly satisfied
      with functional outcome and cosmesis. CONCLUSION: We are encouraged to continue
      to offer our patients the option of a laparoscopic resection.

TI  - Probiotics and medical nutrition therapy.
PG  - 56-68
AB  - Probiotics have been defined by The Food Agricultural Organization/World Health
      Organization (FAO/WHO) as "live microorganisms which when administered in
      adequate amounts confer a health benefit to the host." They have been used for
      centuries in the form of dairy-based fermented products, but the potential use of
      probiotics as a form of medical nutrition therapy has not received formal
      recognition. A detailed literature review (from 1950 through February 2004) of
      English-language articles was undertaken to find articles showing a relationship 
      between probiotic use and medical conditions. Medical conditions that have been
      reportedly treated or have the potential to be treated with probiotics include
      diarrhea, gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel
      disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), cancer, depressed immune
      function, inadequate lactase digestion, infant allergies, failure-to-thrive,
      hyperlipidemia, hepatic diseases, Helicobacter pylori infections, genitourinary
      tract infections, and others. The use of probiotics should be further
      investigated for possible benefits and side-effects in patients affected by these
      medical conditions.

TI  - Response of first attack of inflammatory bowel disease requiring hospital
      admission to steroid therapy.
PG  - 539-44; 544-7
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Corticoid administration is the usual treatment of Crohns disease
      (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) attacks. However, information available on
      response rates and their predictive factors is scarce. OBJECTIVE: To establish
      response to steroidal treatment in an homogeneous group of patients with CD or UC
      during their first admission to hospital. METHODS: Restrospective analysis of 86 
      patients who received systemic steroidal treatment for a severe flare-up during
      their first hospital admission between 1995 and 2000. Patients were treated per
      protocol with fluid therapy, absolute diet, IV 6-methyl-prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day,
      and enoxaparin at prophylactic doses. Clinical response at 30 days was considered
      good in case of complete remission, and poor in case of partial or absent
      remission. Univariate and multivariate analyses according to non-parametric
      statistics were performed for sociodemographic and biologic variables. RESULTS:
      45 patients with CD and 41 with UC were included. Good response rates were 64.4% 
      for CD and 60.9% for UC. The univariate analysis showed that patients with good
      response have shorter evolution times and fewer previous flare-ups (p < 0.05)
      regarding CD. However, the multivariate analysis showed that none of the analyzed
      variables had predictive value. CONCLUSION: The response rate of severe
      inflammatory bowel disease attacks to corticoids is around 60% in CD and UC. Data
      resulting from the current study cannot predict which patients will ultimately
      respond to therapy.

TI  - Influence of dietary factors on the clinical course of ulcerative colitis: a
      prospective cohort study.
PG  - 1479-84
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The causes of relapses of ulcerative colitis (UC) are
      unknown. Dietary factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of UC. The aim 
      of this study was to determine which dietary factors are associated with an
      increased risk of relapse of UC. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was
      performed with UC patients in remission, recruited from two district general
      hospitals, who were followed for one year to determine the effect of habitual
      diet on relapse. Relapse was defined using a validated disease activity index.
      Nutrient intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire and categorised
      into tertiles. Adjusted odds ratios for relapse were determined using
      multivariate logistic regression, controlling for non-dietary factors. RESULTS: A
      total of 191 patients were recruited and 96% completed the study. Fifty two per
      cent of patients relapsed. Consumption of meat (odds ratio (OR) 3.2 (95%
      confidence intervals (CI) 1.3-7.8)), particularly red and processed meat (OR 5.19
      (95% CI 2.1-12.9)), protein (OR 3.00 (95% CI 1.25-7.19)), and alcohol (OR 2.71
      (95% CI 1.1-6.67)) in the top tertile of intake increased the likelihood of
      relapse compared with the bottom tertile of intake. High sulphur (OR 2.76 (95% CI
      1.19-6.4)) or sulphate (OR 2.6 (95% CI 1.08-6.3)) intakes were also associated
      with relapse and may offer an explanation for the observed increased likelihood
      of relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Potentially modifiable dietary factors, such as a high
      meat or alcoholic beverage intake, have been identified that are associated with 
      an increased likelihood of relapse for UC patients. Further studies are needed to
      determine if it is the sulphur compounds within these foods that mediates the
      likelihood of relapse and if reducing their intake would reduce relapse
      frequency.

TI  - Review article: the role of nutrition in the treatment of inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 79-83
AB  - Nutrients may be involved in the modulation of the immune response through at
      least three different mechanisms. First, the intestinal ecosystem plays a pivotal
      role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, triggering the
      uncontrolled inflammatory response in genetically predisposed individuals.
      Nutrients, together with bacteria, are major components of, and can therefore
      influence, the intestinal environment. Second, as components of cell membranes,
      nutrients can mediate the expression of proteins involved in the immune response,
      such as cytokines, adhesion molecules and nitric oxide synthase. The composition 
      of lipids in the cell membrane is modified by dietary changes and can influence
      cellular responses. Indeed, various epidemiological, experimental and clinical
      data suggest that the immune response may be sensitive to changes in dietary
      composition. Finally, suboptimal levels of micronutrients are often found in both
      children and adults with inflammatory bowel disease, although, with the exception
      of iron and folate, it is unusual to discover symptoms attributable to these
      deficits. However, subclinical deficits may have a pathophysiological
      significance, as they may favour the self-perpetuation of the disease (due to
      defects in the mechanisms of tissue repair), cause defective defence against
      damage produced by oxygen free radicals and facilitate lipid peroxidation. These 
      events can occur even in clinically inactive or mildly active disease, as well as
      in the development of dysplasia in the intestinal mucosa. Some dietary
      manipulations have been attempted as primary treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, 
      and specially formulated diets for enteral nutrition have proved to be an
      effective treatment for Crohn's disease. Most trials, although lacking sufficient
      patient numbers, have demonstrated a role for dietary manipulation as primary
      therapy for inflammatory disease. Dietary lipids are one of the most active
      nutritional substrates modulating the immune response. Recently, it has been
      demonstrated that lipids may be a key factor explaining the therapeutic effect of
      clinical nutrition in Crohn's disease.

TI  - Collagenous colitis as the presenting feature of biopsy-defined celiac disease.
PG  - 664-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior case reports have linked celiac disease with collagenous
      colitis, but serological and retrospective pathologic survey studies of small
      intestinal biopsies have produced conflicting results. METHODS: In this report,
      consecutive patients with chronic diarrhea and the initial finding of collagenous
      colitis were evaluated to determine if occult celiac disease was also present.
      All 36 patients with no exclusions were offered upper endoscopy and biopsies. If 
      the changes of untreated celiac disease were detected in the small intestinal
      biopsies, then a gluten-free diet was instituted. Diet response was based on
      resolution of diarrhea and normalization of repeated small intestinal biopsies.
      RESULTS: Eight patients, or over 20%, had severely abnormal small bowel biopsy
      changes characteristic of untreated celiac disease. In some, lymphocytic or
      collagenous gastritis were also detected with or without celiac disease. All 8
      patients were treated with a gluten-free diet alone and, in all, diarrhea
      improved and small intestinal biopsies normalized. In 5, however, repeated
      colonic biopsies showed persistent collagen deposits. Autoimmune thyroid disease 
      or neoplastic diseases, like lymphoma known to be associated with celiac disease 
      were also noted in this cohort with collagenous colitis, often in the absence of 
      celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that collagenous colitis may be
      the presenting clinical and pathologic feature of celiac disease. Diagnosis of
      collagenous colitis should lead the clinician to consider exclusion of underlying
      occult celiac disease.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease: the role of environmental factors.
PG  - 394-400
AB  - Environmental factors are essential components of the pathogenesis of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and primarily responsible for its growing
      incidence around the globe. Epidemiological, clinical and experimental evidence
      support an association between IBD and a large number of seemingly unrelated
      environmental factors, which include smoking, diet, drugs, geographical and
      social status, stress, microbial agents, intestinal permeability and
      appendectomy. Data supporting the involvement of each of these factors in
      predisposing to, triggering, or modulating the course or outcome of IBD vary from
      strong to tenuous. Smoking and the enteric bacterial flora are the ones for which
      the most solid evidence is currently available. Smoking increases the risk of
      Crohn's disease (CD) and worsens its clinical course, but has a protective effect
      in ulcerative colitis (UC). Presence of enteric bacteria is indispensable to
      develop gut inflammation in most animal models of IBD, and modulation of the
      quantity or quality of the flora can be beneficial in patients with IBD.
      Surprisingly, evidence for a major role of the diet in inducing or modifying IBD 
      is limited, while that for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is more
      convincing than for oral contraceptives. Northern geographic location, and a high
      social, economical, educational or occupational status increase the risk of IBD, 
      an observation fitting the hygiene hypothesis for allergic and autoimmune
      diseases. Stress is also associated with IBD, but more as a modifier than an
      inducing factor, and its contribution is more obvious in IBD animal models than
      human IBD. Finally, an increased intestinal permeability may increase the risk
      for developing CD, whereas an appendectomy lowers the risk of developing UC.

TI  - Resistant starches and health.
PG  - 769-74
AB  - It was initially hypothesized that resistant starches, i.e., starch that enters
      the colon, would have protective effects on chronic colonic diseases, including
      reduction of colon cancer risk and in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Recent
      studies have confirmed the ability of resistant starch to increase fecal bulk,
      increase the molar ratio of butyrate in relation to other short-chain fatty
      acids, and dilute fecal bile acids. However the ability of resistant starch to
      reduce luminal concentrations of compounds that are damaging to the colonic
      mucosa, including fecal ammonia, phenols, and N-nitroso compounds, still requires
      clear demonstration. As such, the effectiveness of resistant starch in preventing
      or treating colonic diseases remains to be assessed. Nevertheless, there is a
      fraction of what has been termed resistant (RS1) starch, which enters the colon
      and acts as slowly digested or lente carbohydrate in the small intestine. Foods
      in this class are low glycemic index and have been shown to reduce the risk of
      chronic disease. They have been associated with systemic physiological effects
      such as reduced postprandial insulin levels and higher HDL cholesterol levels.
      Consumption of low glycemic index foods has been shown to be related to
      reductions in risk of coronary heart disease and Type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes
      has in turn been related to a higher risk of colon cancer. If carbohydrates have 
      a protective role in colon cancer prevention this may lie partly in the systemic 
      effects of low glycemic index foods. The colonic advantages of different
      carbohydrates, varying in their glycemic index and resistant starch content,
      therefore, remain to be determined. However, as recent positive research findings
      continue to mount, there is reason for optimism over the possible health
      advantages of those resistant starches, which are slowly digested in the small
      intestine.

TI  - Applications and uses of resistant starch.
PG  - 727-32
AB  - For the past 30 years there has been a steady increase in our knowledge of the
      sources, uses and physiological effects of resistant starch. However, it has only
      been in the past decade that the use of ingredients with a high resistant starch 
      content has occurred in foods, initially in Australia but now throughout the
      world. Foods containing these resistant starch-rich ingredients include not only 
      staple foods, such as bread and breakfast cereals, but also foods designed for
      those with special physiological or medical needs, such as celiac sensitivity and
      ulcerative colitis, or for individuals who are seeking to manage energy intake
      and control weight. Resistant starch has other benefits when compared with
      traditional sources of dietary fiber in that the preparation and design of foods 
      with additional health benefits have the appearance, taste, and texture
      characteristics that encourage people to consume these "better for you" foods. As
      our knowledge of the range of physiological effects that occur through the
      consumption of resistant starch increases, more applications will be found for
      their inclusion in an expanding range of foods around the world.

TI  - A novel mouse model of rectal cancer established by orthotopic implantation of
      colon cancer cells.
PG  - 514-9
AB  - A novel intraluminal colon tumor model was established in mice by intrarectal
      instillation of colon cancer cells followed by short-term induction of colitis by
      an irritant agent. Male BALB/c mice were fed a diet containing 3% (w/w) dextran
      sulfate sodium (DSS) for 7 days to induce colitis, and colon 26 cells (1-2 x
      10(6) cells/mouse) were infused intrarectally after the mice had been deprived of
      food for the last 18 h of DSS treatment. The tumor incidence (%) and size (mean
      volume +/- SD, mm(3)) at the rectal mucosa were 35% (2 +/- 3), 95% (96 +/- 79),
      95% (141 +/- 137) and 94% (325 +/- 270) at 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks after instillation
      of tumor cells, respectively. Histopathological analyses revealed that a solid
      tumor was formed initially at the rectal mucosa at 1 week after instillation,
      then became invasive into the submucosal and muscular tissues at 3 weeks after
      implantation. Intrarectal instillation of human colon cancer cells, LS174T (1 x
      10(7) cells/mouse), mixed with "Matrigel" (0.5 mg/mouse), an extracellular matrix
      solution, in SCID mice led to formation of rectal tumors at 4 weeks after
      instillation, and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the tumor cells
      expressed human carcinoembryonic antigen, suggesting that the tumor nodule was
      derived from the instilled LS174T cells. Oral or intravenous administration of a 
      camptothecin (CPT) derivative, CPT-11, resulted in a significant reduction in
      tumor incidence and tumor volume in the colon 26-intraluminal implantation
      system. In conclusion, it was suggested that the present intraluminal colon tumor
      model is useful for examination of chemotherapeutic agents and also intraluminal 
      factors (dietary compounds, intestinal microflora, etc.) that might function to
      suppress or enhance the growth of colorectal cancer in situ.

TI  - [Lactose malabsorption in patients with inflammatory bowel disease without
      activity: would it be necessary to exclude lactose products in the diet of all
      patients?].
PG  - 212-4
AB  - INTRODUCTION: There are inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients avoid lacteal
      products without evidence of lactose malabsorption, probably because of incorrect
      patient perceptions and arbitrary advice from physicians and diet books. AIM: To 
      evaluate the prevalence of lactose malabsorption in patients with IBP. METHOD: In
      18 patients with Crohns disease and 24 with ulcerative colitis and 25 controls
      the prevalence of lactose intolerance, as measured by lactose breath hydrogen
      tests. RESULTS: Observed deficiencies of absorption of the lactose in 7 (16.6%)
      patients with IBP and 5 (20%) subjects control. CONCLUSIONS: Not all the patients
      with IBD are intolerant to the lactose by the suppression of the lacteal produts 
      must not be generalized in the diet of these patients.

TI  - Clinical epidemiology of inflammatory bowel disease: Incidence, prevalence, and
      environmental influences.
PG  - 1504-17
AB  - Although the incidence and prevalence of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease
      are beginning to stabilize in high-incidence areas such as northern Europe and
      North America, they continue to rise in low-incidence areas such as southern
      Europe, Asia, and much of the developing world. As many as 1.4 million persons in
      the United States and 2.2 million persons in Europe suffer from these diseases.
      Previously noted racial and ethnic differences seem to be narrowing. Differences 
      in incidence across age, time, and geographic region suggest that environmental
      factors significantly modify the expression of Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis. The strongest environmental factors identified are cigarette smoking and
      appendectomy. Whether other factors such as diet, oral contraceptives,
      perinatal/childhood infections, or atypical mycobacterial infections play a role 
      in expression of inflammatory bowel disease remains unclear. Additional
      epidemiologic studies to define better the burden of illness, explore the
      mechanism of association with environmental factors, and identify new risk
      factors are needed.

      analysis of old and new hypotheses.
PG  - 497-508
AB  - The increase in incidence in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease during
      the 20th century has led to an abundance of different hypotheses on what sort of 
      exposures are responsible. There has been a special focus on dietary factors, as 
      well as on other exposures introduced on a population-based level, including fast
      food, cola drinks, toothpaste, antibiotics and oral contraceptives. The aim of
      this review is to critically assess the results from the different observational 
      studies that have investigated these hypotheses, and also to propose research
      agendas that should be pursued in the future. The conclusion is that infectious
      exposures and early bacterial colonization, which are associated with better
      hygiene early in life and that influence immune function, and possibly oral
      contraceptives, remain the only exposures of interest for future research into
      the aetiology of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.

TI  - Complete histological resolution of collagenous sprue.
PG  - 333-6
AB  - A 65-year-old woman developed a watery diarrhea syndrome with collagenous
      colitis. Later, weight loss and hypoalbuminemia were documented. This prompted
      small bowel biopsies that showed pathological changes of collagenous sprue. An
      apparent treatment response to a gluten-free diet and prednisone resulted in
      reduced diarrhea, weight gain and normalization of serum albumin. Later repeated 
      biopsies from multiple small and large bowel sites over a period of over three
      years, however, showed reversion to normal small intestinal mucosa but persistent
      collagenous colitis. These results indicate that collagenous inflammatory disease
      may be a far more extensive process in the gastrointestinal tract than is
      currently appreciated. Moreover, collagenous colitis may be a clinical signal
      that occult small intestinal disease is present. Finally, collagenous sprue may, 
      in some instances, be a completely reversible small intestinal disorder.

TI  - Physical activity and reduced risk of incident sporadic colorectal adenomas:
      observational support for mechanisms involving energy balance and inflammation
      modulation.
PG  - 983-92
AB  - To investigate the role of physical activity, energy balance, and inflammation on
      the risk of incident sporadic colorectal adenoma, the authors conducted a
      community- and colonoscopy-based case-control study (n = 177 cases, n = 228
      controls) in Winston-Salem and Charlotte, North Carolina, from 1995 to 1997.
      Participants reported energy intake by a semiquantitative food frequency
      questionnaire, daily physical activity levels by a standardized questionnaire,
      and anthropometrics by self-assessment. The odds ratios for adenomas comparing
      the highest and lowest quantiles of exposure were 0.63 (95% confidence interval
      (CI): 0.34, 1.17) for physical activity, 0.80 (95% CI: 0.37, 1.73) for total
      energy intake, 0.70 (95% CI: 0.37, 1.34) for body mass index, 1.46 (95% CI: 0.73,
      2.92) for waist/hip ratio, and 2.40 (95% CI: 1.24, 4.63) for height. For the
      combined effects of these factors, risk was particularly low for those with
      higher physical activity and low waist/hip ratio (odds ratio = 0.37, 95% CI:
      0.18, 0.75) or shorter stature (odds ratio = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.16, 0.62). The
      inverse effect of physical activity was apparent only among those not taking
      nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (odds ratio = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.25, 0.94).
      These findings add further evidence that physical activity and overall patterns
      indicating positive energy balance increase the risk of adenoma. Furthermore, the
      results suggest indirectly that biologic mechanisms related to inflammation may
      play a role in the beneficial effect of physical activity on the risk of incident
      adenoma.

TI  - Quality of life in patients with an ileostomy.
PG  - 23-9
AB  - AIM: Temporary or permanent ileostomy is a common procedure in colorectal
      surgery. Our aim was to assess the impact of ileostomy on quality of life and the
      relevant risk factors. METHODS: A 33-question questionnaire was sent, by mail, to
      74 patients (over 70, between 70 and 50 and under 50 y old). The questionnaire
      explored 5 parameters of function: systemic symptoms, bowel symptoms, functional 
      impairment, social impairment and emotional impairment. Further questions
      investigated the need for a nurse or relative to assist with management of the
      stoma, the frequency of changing the bag and the appliance, diet and the ability 
      of patients to attend their normal daily activity. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients 
      completed the questionnaire. The final quality of life score was similar for all 
      the 3 age groups but elderly patients needed more assistance in the stoma
      management. The quality of life scores in males patients were significantly
      better than in females. No statistically significant difference was observed
      comparing loop ileostomy versus end ileostomy and Crohn's disease versus
      ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Quality of life is not influenced by age,
      underlying inflammatory disease or type of ileostomy. Males report less impact on
      quality of life than women.

TI  - Effects of meal frequency and high-fibre rye-bread diet on glucose and lipid
      metabolism and ileal excretion of energy and sterols in ileostomy subjects.
PG  - 1410-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of a rye, high-fibre diet (HFD) vs a wheat, 
      low-fibre diet (LFD), meal frequency, nibbling (Nib, seven times a day) or
      ordinary (Ord, three times a day), and their combined effects on blood glucose,
      insulin, lipids, urinary C-peptide and ileal excretion of energy, cholesterol and
      bile acids in humans. DESIGN: LFD period with Nib or Ord meal frequency followed 
      by an HFD diet with Nib or Ord meal frequency in randomized, crossover design.
      SETTING: Outpatients of ileostomy volunteers were called for an investigation in 
      research word. SUBJECTS: A total of 10 subjects (two female subjects, age 34 and 
      51 y; eight males, mean age 54.4 y, range 43-65 y) participated in the
      experiment. All subjects were proctocolectomized for ulcerative colitis (mean
      16.0 y, range 8-29 y before the study). INTERVENTION: In total, 10 ileostomy
      subjects started with LFD for 2 weeks, the first week on either Nib (five
      subjects) or Ord (five subjects) and the second week on the other meal
      frequencies, in a crossover design, followed by a wash-out week, and continued
      with HFD period for 2 weeks in the same meal frequency manner. All foods consumed
      in both Nib or Ord regimens were identical and a high-fibre rye bread was used in
      the HFD period and a low-fibre wheat bread in the LFD period. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURES: Day-profiles of blood glucose, insulin and lipids, blood lipids before 
      and after dietary intervention, and excretion of steroids in the effluents and
      C-peptide in the urine. RESULTS: During the Nib regimen, plasma glucose and
      insulin peaks were lower at the end of the day with HFD compared with LFD.
      Urinary C-peptide excretion was significantly higher in the day-time on LFD
      compared with HFD (LFD-Ord vs HFD-Ord, P < 0.01; LFD-Nib vs HFD-Nib, P < 0.01).
      Plasma free-cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides and phospholipids were 
      significantly higher (P < 0.05) after LFD than after HFD with the Nib regimen. A 
      higher excretion of energy (P < 0.05) and chenodeoxycholic acid (P < 0.05) were
      observed with HFD compared with LFD regardless of meal frequency. A higher daily 
      excretion of cholic acid, total bile acids, cholesterol, net cholesterol and net 
      sterols (P < 0.05) was observed on HFD compared with LFD with the Nib regimen.
      CONCLUSIONS: An HFD decreased insulin secretion measured as a decreased excretion
      of C-peptide in urine and as decreased plasma insulin peaks at the end of the day
      during a Nib regimen. The smoother glycaemic responses at the end of the day
      during a Nib regimen may be a consequence of a second meal phenomenon, possibly
      related to the nature of dietary fibre complex.

TI  - Non-gluten sensitivity-related small bowel villous flattening with increased
      intraepithelial lymphocytes: not all that flattens is celiac sprue.
PG  - 546-50
AB  - Seven patients (mean age, 37.6 years; 5 women) had several weeks of gluten
      sensitivity (GS)-like symptoms; 2 had flu-like symptom prodromes. The 7 cases had
      morphologically similar biopsy specimens; all tissue fragments had uniform
      injury--increased lymphoplasmacytic lamina propria inflammation, moderate to
      complete villous flattening, numerous crypt mitoses, and markedly increased
      villous intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs). All patients were diagnosed with GS
      and prescribed a gluten-free diet; all returned 9 to 38 weeks later questioning
      their diagnosis because symptoms had resolved substantially or completely.
      Clinical improvement was unrelated to gluten abstinence or ingestion. Repeated
      endoscopy and colonoscopy performed 4.1 to 16 months later showed normal mucosa
      in all 7 patients. Diseases other than GS can cause marked villous flattening and
      increased villous IELs in adults. The cause of small bowel mucosal injury is
      unknown. A similar non-GS-associated clinicopathologic complex, assumed to be due
      to a protracted viral enteritis or slow regression of a virus-induced immune
      reaction, occurs in children. The temporal aspects of symptom improvement and
      mucosal restitution in these 7 patients are similar to "acute self-limited
      colitis." An overly exuberant immune response to an infectious agent is possible.

TI  - Germinated barley foodstuff prolongs remission in patients with ulcerative
      colitis.
PG  - 643-7
AB  - Germinated barley foodstuff (GBF) is a prebiotic which increases luminal butyrate
      production by modulating the microfloral distribution. GBF has been shown to
      reduce both clinical activity and mucosal damage in active ulcerative colitis
      (UC) with mild to moderate activity. However, the efficacy of GBF in patients
      with UC during the remission stage is unknown. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the efficacy of GBF as a maintenance therapy in patients with UC
      while in remission. Fifty-nine patients with UC in remission according to
      Rachmilewitz's clinical activity index (CAI) score of </=4 were enrolled and
      divided into two groups, control (n=37) and GBF (n=22). Patients in the control
      group were given conventional treatment alone for 12 months, while patients in
      the GBF group received conventional therapy plus 20 g of GBF daily. The response 
      to treatments was assessed by monitoring the CAI and endoscopic score according
      to Matts. Significantly better CAI values were seen in the GBF group at 3, 6, and
      12 months compared with the values in the control group. The cumulative
      recurrence rate in the GBF group with steroid tapering treatment was
      significantly lower compared with the value in the control group. No side effects
      related to GBF were observed. GBF appeared to be effective and safe as a
      maintenance therapy to taper steroid dose and prolong remission in patients with 
      UC.

TI  - Dietary beliefs of people with ulcerative colitis and their effect on relapse and
      nutrient intake.
PG  - 161-70
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Ulcerative colitis usually follows a relapsing and remitting
      course. Patients believe that dietary factors are important. We wished to
      determine the nature of and reasons for patients' dietary beliefs and their
      effect on relapse and nutrient intake. METHODS: In a 1-year prospective cohort
      study, patients' nutrient intake and disease activity were measured with a
      validated food frequency questionnaire and disease activity index. Food beliefs, 
      demographics and disease characteristics were recorded. The influence of beliefs 
      on the risk of relapse and nutrient intake were examined using chi-squared and
      Mann-Whitney U-tests. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-three patients were studied
      and 52% relapsed. Sixty-eight per cent held dietary beliefs and reported
      modifying their intake accordingly. The most common reported behaviour was the
      avoidance of milk and dairy products. Food beliefs were more common amongst those
      who had received dietary advice. No reported behaviour reduced the risk of
      relapse, but patients who avoided dairy products had a significantly lower intake
      of calcium. Folate intake was below UK recommended levels in 13% of patients.
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ulcerative colitis believe that many foods are harmful
      or helpful to their disease activity. Commonly held beliefs do not modify the
      risk of relapse, but do adversely affect nutrient intake.

TI  - Gastric emptying function after ileal J pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative
      colitis.
PG  - 81-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known of the effects on gastric function after ileal J
      pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) for ulcerative colitis. This study aimed to
      determine whether patients with postoperative high stool frequency after IPAA
      exhibit impaired gastric function. METHODS: Gastric emptying time (GET) for a
      solid diet (rice gruel) with the use of a radioisotope method and for a liquid
      diet (orange juice) with the use of an acetaminophen method were assessed in 36
      patients with ulcerative colitis more than 30 months after closure of protective 
      ileostomy. Patients were divided into 2 groups: 18 patients with stool frequency 
      less than 6 per day (group A) and 18 patients with stool frequency more than 7
      per day (group B). GET for solid and liquid diets in groups A and B were compared
      with those in 18 healthy volunteers (group C). We correlated the time of peak
      blood concentration of acetaminophen (TPBCA) and both individual stool frequency 
      per day and the length of distal ileum removed. RESULTS: GET for the solid diet
      in groups A and B was not altered by IPAA compared with group C. GET for the
      liquid diet in groups A and B was slower than in group C (P<.0001). GETs for the 
      liquid diet at 60 minutes or more in group A were slower than in group B
      (P<.0001); TPBCA was longer in group A than in groups B or C (P<.01). There were 
      inverse correlations between TPBCA and individual stool frequency per day and
      between TPBCA and length of distal ileum removed (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Rapid
      transit from the stomach of the liquid diet in group B compared with group A may 
      influence high stool frequency after IPAA. Our results suggested that, to obtain 
      an adequate stool frequency after IPAA, the length of distal ileum removal should
      be less than 15 cm.

TI  - Current therapy of ulcerative colitis in children.
PG  - 37-53
AB  - Ulcerative colitis presents in childhood in 10% of those affected, usually with
      pancolitis. Important features in management include growth, development and
      avoidance of treatment toxicity. This review addresses the current treatment
      options including both the paediatric evidence-based experience and areas where
      paediatric practice is informed by adult studies. Standard treatments include
      sulfasalazine or 5-aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, purine derivatives
      (azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine) and surgery. Other immunosuppressant therapies
      and the emerging roles for biological therapies and probiotics are discussed.

TI  - Evaluation of educational programs in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 356-62
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the status of patient knowledge in inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) and potential benefit of educational programs. The authors
      conducted this study to assess 1) the knowledge of IBD of participants attending 
      educational workshops offered to the public and 2) the effect of the workshop on 
      participants' knowledge level. METHODS: Workshops on IBD were offered to the
      public at nine communities in the United States. Each workshop consisted of a
      combination of 3 hours of presentations and question-and-answer sessions.
      Participants, including patients with IBD and their parents, spouses, siblings,
      friends, and significant others, were asked to complete the Crohn's and Colitis
      Knowledge Score questionnaires just before (Q1) and immediately after (Q2) the
      workshop and approximately 3 months later (Q3). The authors scored one point for 
      each correct answer to the 30 questions in the Crohn's and Colitis Knowledge
      Score. RESULTS: Of the 734 who completed the Q1, 33.7% gave correct answers for
      questions about IBD complications, 36.2% for treatment, 61.4% for general
      knowledge, and 64.8% for diet. After the workshop, the proportion for these four 
      knowledge areas increased by 11.0% to 19%. For the participants who completed all
      of the three questionnaires and answered all the 30 questions (N=59), the mean
      score was 18 at Q1, 22 at Q2 (p<0.001, Q2 vs. Q1), and 21 at Q3 (p<0.001, Q3 vs. 
      Q1). CONCLUSIONS: The public's general knowledge of IBD is low. Educational
      programs oriented toward IBD improve participant's knowledge, and the knowledge
      they acquired is retained for at least 3 months.

TI  - Effects of dietary folate on ulcerative colitis-associated colorectal
      carcinogenesis in the interleukin 2- and beta(2)-microglobulin-deficient mice.
PG  - 1262-7
AB  - Folate supplementation may reduce the risk of colorectal dysplasia and cancer in 
      subjects with chronic ulcerative colitis (UC). The interleukin (IL) 2- and
      beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)m)-deficient (IL-2(null) x beta(2)m(null)) mice
      spontaneously develop colon cancer in the setting of chronic UC. This study
      investigated the effects of dietary folate on the development of UC-associated
      colon cancer in the IL-2(null) x beta(2)m(null) mice. Weaning IL-2(null) x
      beta(2)m(null) mice were randomized to receive 0 (deficient; n = 40), 2 (basal
      requirement; control; n = 46), or 8 (supplemented; n = 36) mg folate/kg diet for 
      32 weeks. At necropsy, all macroscopic colonic tumors were identified and
      histologically classified as dysplasia or adenocarcinoma. The incidence of
      high-grade lesions (high-grade dysplasia/carcinoma in situ and invasive
      adenocarcinoma) in the folate-supplemented group was 46% lower than that in the
      control group (35.3% versus 65.1%, P = 0.009). The incidence of high-grade
      lesions in the folate-deficient group was also 49% lower than that in the control
      group (33.3% versus 65.1%, P = 0.007). The higher mortality rate in the
      folate-deficient group compared with the other two groups (25% versus 6.5% and
      5.6%, P < 0.02) partially accounted for the low incidence of high-grade lesions
      in this group. These data indicate that dietary folate supplementation at 4x the 
      basal dietary requirement significantly suppresses UC-associated colorectal
      carcinogenesis in the IL-2(null) x beta(2)m(null) mice. These data also suggest
      that folate deficiency may inhibit colorectal carcinogenesis in chronic UC.
      However, the high mortality observed in the folate-deficient group precludes a
      definitive conclusion concerning the effect of folate deficiency on UC-associated
      colorectal carcinogenesis in this model.

TI  - Low fasting serum triglyceride level as a precocious marker of autoimmune
      disorders.
PG  - 20
AB  - The authors recently reported the occurrence of low fasting serum triglyceride
      (TG) and high free fatty acid (FFA) levels in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. TG
      estimation in diverse groups of patients with autoimmune disease or hyperactive
      immune response confirmed the occurrence of a similar decrease of TG. In some
      patients, serum FFA level was also evaluated. TG value in lean and obese patients
      was compared with that in lean (n = 108) and obese (n = 208) control subjects
      without autoimmune disease. In patients affected by autoimmune chronic
      thyroiditis with enhanced concentration of antithyroglobulin antibodies and
      without thyroidal failure (n = 24), lean and obese patients had reduced TG
      (-69/%, P < .01 and -52%, P < .0001, respectively). Both lean and obese patients 
      affected by chronic active B or C hepatitis (n = 26), with autoantibodies and
      without signs of hepatic insufficiency or cirrhosis, presented reduced TG (-57%, 
      P < .01 and -61%, P < .001, respectively). A marked TG decrease (-73%, P < .001) 
      was observed in the lean patients affected by lupus-like syndrome (n = 7). The
      lean and obese patients with systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis
      (n = 11) showed TG decrease (-66%, P < .01 and -55%, P < .05, respectively). In
      patients affected by anamnestic allergy or atopic dermatitis/asthma (n = 66),
      both lean and obese, TGs were reduced (-67%, P < .0001 and -62%, P < .001,
      respectively). In isolated cases of diverse autoimmune diseases (scleroderma,
      APECED [autoimmune polyendocrinopathy, candidiasis, and ectodermal dystrophy],
      urticaria or urticarial vasculitis, Reiter or Sjogren syndromes, ulcerative
      colitis or Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis or Guillain-Barre syndrome) (n =
      14), decreased TG was also observed both in the lean and obese subjects (-59%, P 
      < .01 and -57%, P < .01, respectively). Concerning FFA (n = 69), value in lean
      patients (n = 22) vs that in lean controls (n = 18) was increased (520 +/- 31 vs 
      299 +/- 30 mcEq/L, +74%, P < .001), whereas value in obese patients (n = 18) vs
      that in obese control subjects (n = 11) was decreased (542 +/- 34 vs 774 +/- 62, 
      -30%, P < .01). This opposite behavior of FFA in lean and obese patients needs to
      be confirmed. Data in this study seem to indicate that low TG value may be a
      precocious marker of autoimmunity or immune system hyperreactivity.

TI  - [Epidemiology of inflammatory bowel diseases in Veszprem county of Western
      Hungary between 1977 and 2001].
PG  - 1819-27
AB  - INTRODUCTION: An epidemiological study of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in
      Veszprem county (located in western part of Hungary) was carried out from 1977 to
      2001. METHODS: Both hospital and outpatient records of IBD patients were
      collected reviewed carefully. Most patients have been followed up regularly.
      RESULTS: The number of population has decreased during the observed period from
      386,000 to 376,000. The county has both industrial and agrarian parts. 560 new
      ulcerative colitis (UC) cases, 212 Crohn's disease (CD), and 40 indeterminate
      colitides (IC) were diagnosed in the investigated period. Incidence rate
      increased from 1.66 (1977-1981) to 11.01 (1997-2001) in UC, and from 0.41 to 4.68
      in CD, respectively. The incidence rate in IC rose from 0.26 to 0.74. The M/F
      ratio in UC was 1.06, in CD: 1.03, respectively, 41 UD patients and 13 CD
      patients died, the cause of death was disease related in 6 UC and in 6 CD
      patients. The average age at death in UC was not different from that observed in 
      general population (66.4 years) but in CD (50.1 years) it was much earlier. The
      disease related mortality was low, 0.06/100,000 both in UC and CD. The prevalence
      rate at the end of 2001 was 142.6 for UC and 52.9/100,000 inhabitants for CD.
      Mean age at onset in UC was 38.9 +/- 15.5 years, in CD 31.7 +/- 12.8 years. We
      observed only one peak onset of the diseases, in UC it was between 30 and 40
      years, in CD between 20 and 30 years. People living in towns were more liable to 
      acquire the disease (ORUC = 1.27, ORCD = 1.13). The rate of smokers at the onset 
      was 14.3% (OR = 0.25) in UC and 50.5% (OR = 1.98) in CD. Ex-smokers were 18.4%
      and 6.4%. Family history of IBD was present in 3.4% in UC and 9.9% in CD. The
      location of UC (according to the known largest extent) was proctitis in 112
      cases, proctosigmoiditis in 162 cases, left sided colitis in 117 and subtotal or 
      pancolitis in 169 cases. The location of CD was only ileal in 68 cases,
      ileocolonic in 87 cases, colonic in 57 cases. The behaviour of CD was
      non-stricturing-non-penetrating in 63 cases, stricturing in 54 cases, penetrating
      in 95 cases. 59.4% of the CD patients had at least one operation, 6.1% had more
      than 3 operations. CONCLUSION: The incidence and prevalence rates have increased 
      steadily in Veszprem County, now it reaches that of most western European
      countries. There were no gender differences either in UC or CD. Smoking seemed to
      be a risk factor for CD, but it was preventive for UC. The rapid increase in
      incidence supports a role for environmental (e.g. diet, lifestyle changes) risk
      factors.

TI  - Hyperhomocystinemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 586-90
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Thromboembolism is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in 
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) 
      is a risk factor for vascular disease and has been implicated as a mediator of
      thromboembolic events in adults with IBD. The authors studied the link between
      tHcy and IBD in children, in whom associations may be clearer, and investigated
      associations with plasma von Willebrand factor antigen, a marker of vascular
      damage. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 43 patients with IBD (27
      Crohn disease, 9 ulcerative colitis, and 7 indeterminate colitis) and 46 control 
      subjects from a pediatric gastroenterology clinic. Plasma tHcy, plasma 5-methyl
      tetrahydrofolate, red cell folate, plasma vitamin B12, plasma von Willebrand
      factor antigen, and methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) genotype (for
      the C677T mutation) were measured. RESULTS: Plasma tHcy concentrations were
      higher in children with IBD than in control subjects, when corrected for age (P <
      0.05), and plasma tHcy was negatively correlated with plasma 5 methyl
      tetrahydrofolate (P < 0.0005). Plasma 5 methyl tetrahydrofolate and age were the 
      main predictors of plasma tHcy. Neither MTHFR genotype nor von Willebrand factor 
      showed any association with any other measure, and there were no differences
      between children with IBD and control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated plasma tHcy
      is a consequence of IBD in children, probably mediated by poor folate status
      associated with diet or the pathophysiology of the disease.

PG  - 91-104
AB  - Environmental factors play an important role in the disease manifestation, course
      and prognosis of inflammatory bowel disease. Observations on temporal trends and 
      geographical distribution point at risk factors associated with a Western
      lifestyle. A large number of studies have been performed on various factors such 
      as diet, smoking, and several infectious agents. Childhood exposures modifying
      immune responses in later life form a particularly interesting field. However, so
      far, only smoking in Crohn's disease, and smoking cessation in ulcerative colitis
      can be considered established as risk factors for the manifestation of the
      disease. Smoking is also associated with a poor prognosis in Crohn's disease. A
      strong negative association of appendectomy with ulcerative colitis has been very
      consistent across many studies; however, the implications of this finding are
      still obscure.

      outcome and therapy.
PG  - 220-7
AB  - Nutritional deficiencies are frequent in patients with ulcerative colitis and
      Crohn's disease, and negatively influence the outcome of the disease. Growth
      retardation, osteopenia and thromboembolic phenomena are some of the inflammatory
      bowel disease complications in which nutritional deficits are involved. Moreover,
      nutrients can play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease and, in some cases, 
      can be a primary therapeutic tool. Enteral nutrition has proven to play a
      therapeutic role in Crohn's disease. The nutrient(s) responsible for this effect 
      are not well identified but dietary fat appears to be a major factor. In
      ulcerative colitis, unabsorbable carbohydrates can modulate the intestinal
      microbial environment, thus contributing to improve colonic inflammation.

TI  - Regulation of expression of the intestinal oligopeptide transporter (Pept-1) in
      health and disease.
PG  - G779-88
AB  - The abundance of the oligopeptide transporter (Pept-1) in the brush-border
      membrane of the intestinal epithelium is the central mechanism for regulation of 
      transport of products of protein digestion (dipeptides and tripeptides) and
      peptidomimetic drugs (for example, beta-lactam antibiotics). Within the past few 
      years, there has been substantial progress in identifying the factors controlling
      this regulation and the mechanisms of their actions. The purpose of this report
      is to review this progress. The studies of individual substrates and hormones in 
      a human intestinal cell line (Caco-2) have shown that dipeptides, certain amino
      acids, insulin, and leptin increase and epidermal growth factor and
      triiodothyronine decrease the membrane population of Pept-1. In the case of
      dipeptides, epidermal growth factor, and thyroid hormone, there are parallel
      changes in the gene expression brought about by alteration of transcription
      and/or stability of Pept-1 mRNA. In contrast, the treatment with insulin and
      leptin does not induce any alteration in the Pept-1 gene expression, and the
      mechanism of increased protein expression appears to be increased trafficking
      from a preformed cytoplasmic pool to the apical membrane. In vivo studies in rats
      have shown modulation of protein and gene expressions of the intestinal
      oligopeptide transporter during the day and during development and in nutritional
      and metabolic alterations, such as high-protein diet, fasting, and diabetes.
      Patients with intestinal diseases, such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease,
      and short-bowel syndrome, may have induction of the Pept-1 expression in their
      colon. Finally, pharmacological studies have shown that the expression of Pept-1 
      can be upregulated by agents such as 5 fluorouracil and downregulated by agents
      such as cyclosporine. In conclusion, the above studies have produced a wealth of 
      new information on regulation of a key transporter in the intestine. This
      information may have useful applications in nutritional and pharmacological
      treatments, for example, in diabetic patients needing enteral nutrition or in
      ulcerative colitis patients needing the suppression of the intestinal
      inflammation.

TI  - Hepatic metabisulfite sensitivity in a patient with sclerosing cholangitis.
PG  - 314-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary sclerosing cholangitis is an uncommon chronic cholestatic
      liver disease with a poor prognosis in symptomatic cases. Genetic and immunologic
      alterations have been identified, and many possible etiologies have been
      entertained. Most treatments have limited benefit, and primary sclerosing
      cholangitis is a common cause for liver transplantation. OBJECTIVE: To describe a
      patient with documented primary sclerosing cholangitis associated with chronic
      ulcerative colitis, who developed hepatic toxicity following ingestion of
      metabisulfite. RESULTS: A placebo-controlled oral challenge suggested
      metabisulfite hypersensitivity with liver toxicity. He was treated with cobalamin
      (to prevent sulfite toxicity), low-sulfite diet, steroids, and antibiotics and
      has had an unusually benign course for 19 years. CONCLUSIONS: The
      hypersensitivity to oral metabisulfite in our patient appeared to be a
      significant trigger to flare-ups of his disease. Controlling the response to
      metabisulfite (along with recurrent antibiotic and steroid therapy) may have
      contributed significantly to the remarkably good outcome in this patient.

TI  - Treatment of ulcerative colitis patients by long-term administration of
      germinated barley foodstuff: multi-center open trial.
PG  - 701-4
AB  - Germinated barley foodstuff (GBF), which mainly consists of dietary fiber and
      glutamine-rich protein, is a prebiotic for ulcerative colitis (UC). In our
      previous study, we carried out a clinical trial of GBF with mildly to moderately 
      active UC patients and showed that GBF treatment was able to attenuate the
      symptoms of UC in a relatively short-term. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the efficacy of long-term administration of GBF in the treatment of
      UC in a multi-center open trial. Twenty-one patients with mildly to moderately
      active UC received 20-30 g of GBF for 24 weeks in an open-label protocol while
      baseline treatments (5-amino-salicyrate compounds and/or steroids) were
      continued. The response to the GBF treatment was evaluated using a clinical
      scoring and after 24 weeks of observation, the GBF group showed a significant
      decrease in clinical activity index (especially, the degree of visible blood in
      stools and the presence of nocturnal diarrhea) compared with the control group
      (p<0.05). No side effects related to GBF were observed. In conclusion, GBF can
      reduce the clinical activity of UC over long-term as well as short-term
      administration. Nutraceutical GBF therapy may have a place in long-term
      management of UC, but controlled studies are needed to demonstrate its efficacy
      in the treatment of this disorder.

      intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) with normal villous architecture in small
      bowel biopsy samples for diagnosis of gluten sensitivity (GS) and its
      significance in the absence of GS. METHODS: Small bowel biopsy samples from 43
      patients with increased IELs and no other pathology were reviewed. Patients with 
      prior diagnosis of GS were excluded. A group of 46 patients with normal duodenal 
      biopsy during the same period served as controls. The clinical records of
      patients and controls were examined for presenting symptoms, laboratory tests,
      and final clinicopathological diagnosis. Immunohistochemical characterization of 
      IELs was performed in 13 cases. RESULTS: Four (9.3%) patients had GS based on
      positive IgA antiendomysial antibodies (n = 3) and favorable response to
      gluten-free diet (n = 4). One patient (2.2%) had partially treated tropical
      sprue; six patients (14%) had disorders of immune regulation including
      Hashimoto's thyroiditis (n = 2) and one case each of Graves' disease, rheumatoid 
      arthritis, psoriasis, and multiple sclerosis; and six patients (14%) were on
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In contrast, none of the control
      subjects had GS (p = 0.05), tropical sprue, or immunoregulatory disorders (p =
      0.011), and one (2.2%) was on NSAIDs (p = 0.04). Increased IELs were also
      observed in Crohn's disease, lymphocytic/collagenous colitis, and bacterial
      overgrowth, but the association did not reach statistical significance.
      Histological features (number and distribution of IELs, crypt mitoses) and
      immunophenotypic analysis of IELs did not reliably distinguish GS-related from
      non-GS-related causes of increased IELs. CONCLUSIONS: Intraepithelial
      lymphocytosis in an otherwise normal small bowel biopsy is somewhat nonspecific, 
      but in nearly 10% of cases can be the initial presentation of GS. Therefore all
      patients with this finding should be investigated for GS. Increased IELs may also
      be associated with autoimmune disorders and NSAIDs.

PG  - 772-5
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Authors report clinical, biological and endoscopic data of six
      children aged less 3 months with bloody stools while they were exclusively
      breast-fed. RESULTS: Two girls and four boys aged 1 to 2 months presented with
      isolated but recurrent rectal bleeding. All were explored by fiberoptic
      rectosigmoidoscopy between 1 and 3,2 months. Macroscopic aspects were congestion 
      (6 cases), petechial and ecchymotic (4 cases), with normal mucosal areas (5
      cases). Histopathology showed eosinophilic infiltrates in all 5 children with
      rectal biopsy. Evolution was satisfactory after cow's milk protein exclusion in
      maternal diet for five children and after weaning in 1. All children were weaned 
      with protein hydrolysate. Cow's milk protein were later introduced without
      adverse reactions at 6 to 23 months. CONCLUSION: Food allergy can be considered
      in proctocolitis including exclusive breast-fed children. Evolution after
      maternal diet is, as usual, simple.

TI  - Adult celiac disease in northern India.
PG  - 124-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the presentation of adult celiac disease in a northern Indian
      hospital. METHODS: Case records of all patients diagnosed as having adult celiac 
      disease in the Gastroenterology unit of this hospital during January 1996 till
      December 2001 were reviewed. Celiac disease was diagnosed according to the
      revised ESPGAN criteria. Adult celiac disease was diagnosed if disease
      manifestations started after 15 years of age. All patients had a minimum of
      one-year follow up. RESULTS: The mean duration of illness in the 96 patients
      (mean [SD] age 32.9 [11.4] years; 50 men) diagnosed over the 6-year study period 
      was 7.3 (2.4) years. Diarrhea was present is 67.7% of cases; 18.7% presented with
      refractory iron-deficiency anemia, and 9.4% with abdominal symptoms like
      flatulence and distension. Three patients presented with dysphagia and anemia and
      were diagnosed as having Plummer-Vinson syndrome. Ulcerative colitis,
      non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and aphthous ulcers were associated conditions.
      All patients had significant improvement in symptoms and hematological and
      biochemical parameters after dietary gluten restriction. CONCLUSION: Adult celiac
      disease is not rare and usually presents as diarrhea, abdominal distension and
      flatulence, and refractory anemia.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease Part 1: ulcerative colitis--pathophysiology and
      conventional and alternative treatment options.
PG  - 247-83
AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC), a subcategory of inflammatory bowel disease, afflicts
      1-2 million people in the United States, and many more worldwide. Although the
      exact cause of ulcerative colitis remains undetermined, the condition appears to 
      be related to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. While
      conventional treatments can be effective in maintaining remission and decreasing 
      the length of active disease periods, the treatments are not without side
      effects, and a significant number of people suffering from UC fail to respond to 
      even the strongest drugs. This article reviews potential unconventional
      treatments - transdermal nicotine, heparin, melatonin, DHEA, probiotics, fiber,
      dietary changes, botanicals, essential fatty acids, and other nutrients - that
      may be considered in conjunction with conventional approaches or as part of a
      comprehensive alternative treatment protocol. In addition this review addresses
      risk factors, pathogenesis, nutrient deficiencies, conventional treatment
      approaches, and extra-intestinal manifestations of the disease.

TI  - Autoimmune enteropathy and colitis in an adult patient.
PG  - 1600-6
AB  - The presence of circulating autoantibodies to gut enterocytes has been very
      rarely described in adults and is considered a possible cause of refractory
      sprue. Our aims was to describe the case of an adult patient with serum
      anti-enterocyte autoantibodies associated with a clinical picture characterized
      by involvement of both the small intestine and colon. A female, age 50, had
      suffered from diarrhea with mucus and blood, abdominal pain, thinness, anemia,
      and leukopenia since the age of 20. She also suffered from HCV infection and had 
      mild chronic hepatitis. Family history was positive for autoimmunity. Symptoms
      were reported to worsen after eating gluten-containing foods, but
      anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysial antibodies were negative. Intestinal
      histology showed mild, patch villous atrophy with a high intraepithelial
      lymphocyte count, but a normal number of intraepithelial lymphocytes carrying the
      gamma/delta+ receptor. HLA was: A11, A31 (19), B52 (5), DR 15 (2), DR 14 (6), DR 
      51, DR 52, DQ1. Colonoscopy did not show ulcerations or erosions and colon
      histology showed a moderate inflammatory infiltrate without minor crypt
      distortion or granuloma. RAST tests were positive for lactalbumin, lactoglobulin,
      casein, egg, and gliadin. After commencement of an oligoantigenic diet, stool
      frequency initially decreased, but the presence of mucus in the stools persisted,
      with episodes of bloody diarrhea. After one year of diet, nutritional parameters 
      were low and anemia associated with a low leukocyte count persisted. Upper and
      lower gastrointestinal endoscopy and histology of the small intestine and colon
      were virtually unchanged. Consequently, natural autoantibodies and enterocyte
      autoantibodies were assayed. The patient was positive for IgG class enterocyte
      autoantibodies at a titer of 1:34. No other organ-specific or non-organ-specific 
      autoantibodies were positive. Prednisolone treatment was started and the symptoms
      improved. After one year of this treatment plus elimination diet she was
      reevaluated. Bowel movement frequency was normal, body weight increased, and the 
      asthenia had completely regressed. IgG anti-enterocyte autoantibodies were
      absent. Histology of the distal duodenum showed a normal villus/crypt ratio and
      IEL infiltration was reduced. Colon histology showed a reduction in inflammatory 
      infiltrate in the lamina propria. In conclusion, we report a case of generalized 
      gut disorder in an adult patient, affecting both the small intestine and the
      colon and characterized by the presence of circulating anti-enterocyte
      autoantibodies. Systematic testing for enterocyte autoantibodies should be
      performed not only in patients with refractory sprue, but also in subjects with
      upper and lower intestinal symptoms who have not been definitively diagnosed.

TI  - [Neurological complications of inflammatory intestinal diseases].
PG  - 406-14
AB  - A number of neurological symptoms have been described as complications of
      inflammatory bowel disorders such as coeliac disease, Whipple's disease, Crohn's 
      disease and ulcerative colitis. The neurology of coeliac disease includes
      disorders of the central nervous system encompassing cerebellar ataxia, epilepsy,
      myoclonus, dementia and multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Peripheral neuropathies, 
      of axonal and demyelinating types, and myopathies have also been reported. The
      pathomechanisms are more related to immunological-inflammatory processes than to 
      a malresorptive vitamin deficiencies. While CNS symptoms of coeliac disease show 
      a poor response to gluten restriction, peripheral symptoms may respond to
      elimination of gluten from the diet. There are few reports of a successful
      corticosteroid treatment in patients showing inflammatory findings in the CSF or 
      bioptic material. Whipple's disease is caused by the gram-positive bacillus
      Tropheryma whipplei. Patients with a central nervous system manifestation of
      Whipple's disease may develop a variety of symptoms including dementia,
      supranuclear gaze palsy, movement disorders, hypothalamic dysfunction and
      myorhythmia. The CNS-infection is diagnosed by PCR of the CSF. Long-term
      antibiotic treatment is required, and relapses may occur after withdrawal of
      antimicrobial therapy. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are complicated by 
      various forms of polyneuropathies, and arterial and venous cerebrovascular
      diseases. In most cases with neurological complications of inflammatory
      gastrointestinal diseases an immune mediated inflammatory process is suspected to
      be the underlying pathomechanism.

TI  - Is nutrition an aetiological factor for inflammatory bowel disease?
PG  - 607-13
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory process, the aetiology
      of which is complex and probably multi-factorial. Nutrition has been proposed to 
      be an important aetiological factor for IBD. The present review critically
      examines the relationship between components of the diet (such as sugar, fat,
      fibre, fruit and vegetables, and protein) and IBD, including ulcerative colitis
      and Crohn's disease. In addition, it investigates the possible role of infant
      feeding practices in the development of IBD.

TI  - The use of a mini-laparotomy in total abdominal colectomy for mucosal ulcerative 
      colitis.
PG  - 704-8
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Minimally invasive surgery, with its advantages of early return 
      to normal activity and good cosmetic results, is an important goal in the
      treatment of patients with mucosal ulcerative colitis. The aim of this study was 
      to compare outcomes utilizing a mini-laparotomy approach to total abdominal
      colectomy for mucosal ulcerative colitis with those of the conventional approach.
      METHODOLOGY: Eleven patients scheduled to undergo the first (total abdominal
      colectomy) of a 2 or 3-stage operation for mucosal ulcerative colitis via a
      mini-laparotomy between 1999 and 2001 were prospectively studied. The
      mini-laparotomy described here involves total abdominal colectomy performed
      through a skin incision shorter than 7 cm. Seven similar patients who underwent
      conventional laparotomy between 1995 and 1998 served as the control group.
      RESULTS: The mini-laparotomy approach was accomplished in 9 patients (81.8%).
      Patient characteristics between cases and controls were similar. Postoperative
      intervals until standing, walking, flatus, urinary catheter removal, and
      tolerance of solid diet were significantly shorter in the mini-laparotomy group
      (P = 0.031, P = 0.023, P = 0.0033, P = 0.0093, and P = 0.023, respectively).
      CONCLUSIONS: A mini-laparotomy approach to total abdominal colectomy appears
      feasible and safe in selected patient with mucosal ulcerative colitis and poses
      an attractive alternative to conventional laparotomy in patients similar to those
      presented here.

TI  - Increasing fecal butyrate in ulcerative colitis patients by diet: controlled
      pilot study.
PG  - 116-21
AB  - Topical butyrate has been shown to be effective in the treatment of ulcerative
      colitis (UC). Butyrate is derived from colonic fermentation of dietary fiber, and
      our aim was to study whether UC patients could safely increase the fecal butyrate
      level by dietary means. We enrolled 22 patients with quiescent UC (mean age, 44
      years; 45% women; median time from last relapse, 1 year) in a controlled pilot
      trial lasting 3 months. The patients were instructed to add 60 g oat bran
      (corresponding to 20 g dietary fiber) to the daily diet, mainly as bread slices. 
      Fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) including butyrate, disease activity, and
      gastrointestinal symptoms were recorded every 4 weeks. During the oat bran
      intervention the fecal butyrate concentration increased by 36% at 4 weeks (from
      11 +/- 2 (mean +/- SEM) to 15 +/- 2 micromol/g feces) (p < 0.01). The mean
      butyrate concentration over the entire test period was 14 +/- 1 micromol/g feces 
      (p < 0.05). Remaining fecal SCFA levels were unchanged. No patient showed signs
      of colitis relapse. Unlike controls, the patients showed no increase in
      gastrointestinal complaints during the trial. Yet patients reporting abdominal
      pain and reflux complaints at entry showed significant improvement at 12 weeks
      that returned to baseline 3 months later. This pilot study shows that patients
      with quiescent UC can safely take a diet rich in oat bran specifically to
      increase the fecal butyrate level. This may have clinical implications and
      warrants studies of the long-term benefits of using oat bran in the maintenance
      therapy in UC.

TI  - Enhanced histamine metabolism: a comparative analysis of collagenous colitis and 
      food allergy with respect to the role of diet and NSAID use.
PG  - 142-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN: To compare clinical data and histamine metabolism of
      patients with collagenous colitis with those of food allergy. METHODS: In 17
      patients with collagenous colitis, clinical findings (diarrhoea, abdominal pain) 
      were recorded. Plasma (for histamine) and 12-h-urine (for histamine and
      n-methylhistamine, all measured by RIA) were collected during two days with an
      unrestricted diet followed by two days with an hypoallergenic. The clinical data 
      and measured values were compared with those from patients with confirmed food
      allergy (n = 21) and controls (n = 41). RESULTS: Patients with collagenous
      colitis were found to present with significantly more liquid stools than patients
      with food allergy (p < 0.001) during both types of diet, but they did not
      experience more abdominal pain. N-methylhistamine in 12-h-urine was significantly
      increased during both types of diet in patients with collagenous colitis and food
      allergy when compared with controls (p < 0.001 for all). Patients with food
      allergy--but not those with collagenous colitis--showed a significant decrease of
      severity of pain (p < 0.05) when the diet was changed to the elimination
      protocol. CONCLUSION: Histamine is extensively produced and metabolised in
      patients with collagenous colitis. In contrast to food allergy, the allergenic
      potency of the administered food seems not to influence histamine production in
      collagenous colitis. However, histamine metabolism corresponds with the clinical 
      activity in both patients with food allergy and collagenous colitis.

TI  - Importance of processing for physico-chemical and physiological properties of
      dietary fibre.
PG  - 187-92
AB  - There is considerable loss of DM during wet heat treatment of vegetables, leading
      to an increase in dietary fibre. Correction for the loss of DM indicates that the
      effects on total dietary fibre are minor. There is, however, depolymerization of 
      the dietary fibre polysaccharides. The degradation is related to the severity of 
      the heat treatment. Souring, freezing and mild microwave treatment have no
      effects. The viscosity is in general related to the extent of polymerisation.
      Microwave treatment has different effects on various cultivars of green beans,
      and the addition of salt (NaCl and CaCl2) to the boiling water changes the
      physico-chemical properties of soluble fibre in carrots, depending on the cation.
      The higher viscosity of the soluble fibre in raw carrots may partly explain the
      lower glucose and hormonal responses observed in healthy subjects when compared
      with blanched and microwave-cooked carrots. In studies on rats the amount of
      butyric acid in the distal colon has been shown to be higher with dietary
      components containing high amounts of resistant starch. Further, the
      fermentability is lower and the butyric acid concentration higher with composite 
      foods than with the corresponding purified fibre fractions. In human studies the 
      faecal concentration of butyric acid has been shown to increase in patients with 
      ulcerative colitis when [beta-glucan-enriched oat bran (20 g fibre) is added to
      the diet for 12 weeks. Also, an improvement of symptoms was reported.

TI  - Feasibility of laparoscopic adrenalectomy for large adrenal masses.
PG  - 106-10
AB  - Laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA) is a preferred method for the removal of small
      adrenal masses. However, the role of LA for surgical treatment of large adrenal
      masses is less established. We evaluated the outcomes of LA for large (>/=5 cm)
      adrenal masses. We retrospectively reviewed 24 consecutive patients who underwent
      LA for large adrenal masses at a tertiary care university hospital. The average
      age of the 24 patients was 49 years, and each underwent laparoscopic resection of
      a large adrenal mass. All LAs were performed via a lateral transperitoneal
      approach. The average (+/- standard deviation) size of the masses was 6.8 +/- 1.5
      cm (range, 5-11). Pathologic diagnoses included adrenal cortical adenoma (10
      cases), pheochromocytoma ( 7), cyst/pseudocyst ( 3), myolipoma ( 2), and adrenal 
      cortical hyperplasia ( 2). Statistical analysis was performed with a two-sample t
      test. The average operating time was 178 +/- 55 minutes (range, 120-300), and
      average blood loss was 87 +/- 69 mL (range, 20-300); the averages were
      nonsignificantly greater in the right LA group than in the left LA group (203 vs.
      166 minutes, P = 0.89; 124 vs. 77 mL, P = 0.14). The average duration of
      nothing-by-mouth (NPO) status was 0.7 days (range, 0-4), and the average time
      until return to a regular diet was 1.74 +/- 0.9 days (range, 1-5). The average
      length of stay was 2.5 +/- 1.9 days (range, 1-10). One patient had a transient
      episode of pseudomembranous colitis. There were no conversions to open
      adrenalectomy and no major morbidities or mortalities. LA is safe and effective
      for surgical treatment of large adrenal masses. Both right and left large adrenal
      masses can be approached laparoscopically with equal success. The role of
      minimally invasive approaches to adrenal malignancies necessitates further
      investigation.

TI  - Forage feeding to reduce preharvest Escherichia coli populations in cattle, a
      review.
PG  - 852-60
AB  - Although Escherichia coli are commensal organisms that reside within the host
      gut, some pathogenic strains of E. coli can cause hemorrhagic colitis in humans. 
      The most notable enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) strain is O157:H7. Cattle are
      asymptomatic natural reservoirs of E. coli O157:H7, and it has been reported that
      as many as 30% of all cattle are carriers of this pathogen, and in some
      circumstances this can be as high as 80%. Feedlot and high-producing dairy cattle
      are fed large grain rations in order to increase feed efficiency. When cattle are
      fed large grain rations, some starch escapes ruminal microbial degradation and
      passes to the hind-gut where it is fermented. EHEC are capable of fermenting
      sugars released from starch breakdown in the colon, and populations of E. coli
      have been shown to be higher in grain fed cattle, and this has been correlated
      with E. coli O157:H7 shedding in barley fed cattle. When cattle were abruptly
      switched from a high grain (corn) diet to a forage diet, generic E. coli
      populations declined 1000-fold within 5 d, and the ability of the fecal generic
      E. coli population to survive an acid shock similar to the human gastric stomach 
      decreased. Other researchers have shown that a switch from grain to hay caused a 
      smaller decrease in E. coli populations, but did not observe the same effect on
      gastric shock survivability. In a study that used cattle naturally infected with 
      E. coli O157:H7, fewer cattle shed E. coli O157:H7 when switched from a feedlot
      ration to a forage-based diet compared with cattle continuously fed a feedlot
      ration. Results indicate that switching cattle from grain to forage could
      potentially reduce EHEC populations in cattle prior to slaughter; however the
      economic impact of this needs to be examined.

TI  - [Collagenous colitis: macroscopically invisible, but with various treatment
      options].
PG  - 353-6
AB  - Two female patients, aged 54 and 67 years, respectively, had suffered from watery
      diarrhoea for several weeks or months without cramps or blood in the stools. The 
      findings upon physical examination, blood and faecal examination and endoscopy
      were normal, and subsequent histological examination of intestinal biopsies
      revealed collagenous colitis. After treatment with a high-fibre diet,
      sulphasalazine and either prednisone or budesonide, the symptoms subsided.
      Collagenous colitis is a chronic watery diarrhoea disorder with unknown aetiology
      and pathogenesis. It is characterised by macroscopically normal mucosa, while
      histopathologically an abnormal thickening of the subepithelial collagenous layer
      and an increase in the number of intra-epithelial lymphocytes is found. There are
      various treatment options such as dietary fibre, mesalazine or
      bismuthsubsalicylate. Recently budesonide has been found to have a favourable
      effect both clinically and histologically. Complications of the disease are rare.

TI  - Treatment of inflammatory bowel disease in childhood: best available evidence.
PG  - 34-58
AB  - The physician treating children with inflammatory bowel disease is confronted
      with a number of specific problems, one of them being the lack of randomized,
      controlled drug trials in children. In this review, the role of nutritional
      therapy is discussed with a focus on primary treatment, especially for children
      with Crohn's disease. Then, the available medical therapies are highlighted,
      reviewing the evidence of effectiveness and side effects in children, as compared
      with what is known in adults. Nutritional therapy has proven to be effective in
      inducing and maintaining remission in Crohn's disease while promoting linear
      growth. Conventional treatment consists of aminosalicylates and corticosteroids, 
      whereas the early introduction of immunosuppressives (such as azathioprine or
      6-mercaptopurine) is advocated as maintenance treatment. If these drugs are not
      tolerated or are ineffective, methotrexate may serve as an alternative in Crohn's
      disease. Cyclosporine is an effective rescue therapy in severe ulcerative
      colitis, but only will postpone surgery. A novel strategy to treat Crohn's
      disease is offered by infliximab, a monoclonal antibody to the proinflammatory
      cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Based on the best-available evidence,
      suggested usage is provided for separate drugs with respect to dosage and
      monitoring of side effects in children.

TI  - Modification of intestinal flora in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 333-46
AB  - Because the intestinal microflora play an important role in the development of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), there is currently some interest in the
      manipulation of the composition of the microflora towards a potentially more
      remedial community. This review summarizes the clinical and experimental efficacy
      of the manipulation of microflora by the use of prebiotics, probiotics,
      synbiotics, and antibiotics in IBD. Prebiotics, defined as nondigestible food
      ingredients that beneficially affect the host by selectively stimulating the
      growth or activity of one or a limited number of bacterial species already
      resident in the colon, can modulate the colonic microbiota by increasing the
      number of specific bacteria and thus changing the composition of the microbiota. 
      Prebiotics for IBD include lactosucrose, oligofructose, inulin, bran, psyllium,
      and germinated barley foodstuff (GBF). GBF, which mainly consists of dietary
      fiber and glutamine-rich protein, is a prebiotic foodstuff for ulcerative
      colitis. GBF has shown to be converted into a preferential nutrient for
      colonocytes through Eubacterium and Bifidobacterium and also inactivate nuclear
      factor kappa B (NFkB). Moreover, it exhibits a potent water-holding capacity and 
      bile-acid binding capacity. Probiotics, which are microbial food supplements that
      beneficially affect the host by improving the intestinal microbial balance, have 
      been used to change the composition of colonic microbiota. The approaches for IBD
      include VSL#3, Nissle1917, Clostridium butyricum and Bifidobacterium-fermented
      milk. Use of Lactococci secreting IL-10 provides excellent results. The
      combination of prebiotics and probiotics in a synbiotic has not been studied in
      IBD but is promising. The use of antibiotics continues to be of interest.
      Although these strategies hold great promise and appear to be useful in some
      settings, more clinical study is needed to firmly establish the relevance of
      these therapies.

TI  - Review article: nutrition and adult inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 307-20
AB  - Major advances in the understanding of the aetio-pathogenesis and genetics of
      inflammatory bowel disease have been accompanied by an escalation in the
      sophistication of immunomodulatory inflammatory bowel disease therapeutics.
      However, the basic 'triple' therapy (5-aminosalicylates, corticosteroids,
      azathioprine) and nutrition have maintained their central role in the management 
      of patients with inflammatory bowel disease over recent decades. This review
      provides an overview of the supportive and therapeutic perspectives of nutrition 
      in adult inflammatory bowel disease. The objective of supportive nutrition is to 
      correct malnutrition in terms of calorie intake or specific macro- or
      micronutrients. Of particular clinical relevance is deficiency in calcium,
      vitamin D, folate, vitamin B12 and zinc. There is justifiably a growing sense of 
      unease amongst clinicians and patients with regard to the long-term use of
      corticosteroids in inflammatory bowel disease. This, rather than arguments about 
      efficacy, should be the catalyst for revisiting the use of enteral nutrition as
      primary treatment in Crohn's disease. Treatment failure is usually related to a
      failure to comply with enteral nutrition. Potential factors that militate against
      successful completion of enteral nutrition are feed palatability, inability to
      stay on a solid-free diet for weeks, social inconvenience and transient
      feed-related adverse reactions. Actions that can be taken to improve treatment
      outcome include the provision of good support from dietitians and clinicians for 
      the duration of treatment and the subsequent 'weaning' period. There is evidence 
      to support a gradual return to a normal diet through exclusion-re-introduction or
      other dietary regimen following the completion of enteral nutrition to increase
      remission rates. We also review the evidence for emerging therapies, such as
      glutamine, growth factors and short-chain fatty acids. The future may see the
      evolution of enteral nutrition into an important therapeutic strategy, and the
      design of a 'Crohn's disease-specific formulation' that is individually tailored,
      acceptable to patients, cost-effective, free from adverse side-effects and
      combines enteral nutrition with novel pre- and pro-biotics and other factors.

TI  - Use of probiotics in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 111-9
AB  - The gut flora plays a fundamental role in maintaining normal intestinal function.
      A disturbance of this flora, or the host response to this flora, has been clearly
      demonstrated to play a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD). This has led to attempts to modify the bacterial flora with "live
      non-pathogenic organisms that confer health benefits by improving the microbial
      balance," otherwise known as probiotics. Recent attention has focused on this
      potential strategy to treat or prevent IBD. The potential therapeutic benefit is 
      enhanced by the natural and apparently safe approach that probiotics offer.
      Animal models of colitis have provided the proof of principle that probiotics can
      prevent and treat established intestinal inflammation. Controlled clinical
      studies have demonstrated the efficacy of probiotics in the maintenance of
      remission of pouchitis, prophylaxis of pouchitis after the formation of an
      ileoanal reservoir, maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis, and treatment
      of Crohn's disease. However, large controlled trials are needed to definitively
      establish the place for probiotics in the treatment of IBD and resolve issues
      such as the dose, duration, frequency of treatment, and use of single or multiple
      strains. Research is focusing on establishing the mechanism of action, so that
      treatments with individually tailored properties are developed and innovative
      approaches are explored.

TI  - Refractory coeliac sprue is a diffuse gastrointestinal disease.
PG  - 205-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: Refractory coeliac sprue (RCS) with an immunophenotypically aberrant 
      clonal intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) population is considered a cryptic form
      of intestinal T cell lymphoma. AIMS: To investigate the distribution of the
      abnormal and monoclonal IEL population in the digestive tract of RCS patients.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: We compared the frequency of lymphocytic gastritis (LG) and
      lymphocytic colitis (LC), together with IEL phenotype and T cell clonality, in
      gastric and colonic samples from 15 adults with RCS (all with aberrant CD3
      intracytoplasmic(+) surface(-) CD8(-) clonal IELs on duodenojejunal biopsies), 18
      patients with active coeliac disease (ACD), and 10 patients with coeliac disease 
      (CD) on a gluten free diet (GFD-CD) by means of immunohistochemistry and
      multiplex polymerase chain reaction amplification of the T cell receptor gamma
      gene (TCR-gamma) rearrangement. Blood samples of nine RCS patients were also
      tested for clonality. RESULTS: LG was found in 9/14 (64%), 11/18 (61%), and 3/10 
      (30%) patients with RCS, ACD, and GFD-CD, respectively, while LC was found in
      6/11 (55%), 3/4 (75%), and 2/3 (66%) patients. Contrary to CD, all samples from
      patients with LG and LC showed an aberrant IEL phenotype. Monoclonal TCR-gamma
      rearrangements were detected in 8/13 (62%), 8/10 (80%), and 4/9 (44%) of gastric,
      colonic, and blood samples, respectively, from RCS patients, while in CD patients
      such rearrangements were only found in 2/25 (8%) gastric samples. CONCLUSION: The
      immunophenotypically aberrant monoclonal IEL population present in the small
      intestine of patients with RCS frequently disseminates to the blood and the
      entire gastrointestinal epithelium, suggesting that this is a diffuse
      gastrointestinal disease.
