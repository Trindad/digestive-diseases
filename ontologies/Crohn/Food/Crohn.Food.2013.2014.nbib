TI  - Baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) antigen in obese and normal weight
      subjects.
PG  - 42-7

AB  - Baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and its cell wall components have been
      used as one of the alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters in the feed
      industry. Antibodies to cell wall mannan of this yeast (ASCA) have been
      traditionally used in the study of Crohn's disease (CD). We applied ASCA in
      relation to obesity. This study aims (i) to determine the concentration of ASCA
      (immunoglobulin A [IgA] and immunoglobulin G [IgG]) in obese compared with normal
      weight individuals and (ii) to determine if there is a correlation between ASCA
      concentrations, obesity indices and C-reactive protein. Forty obese individuals
      (body mass index [BMI] > 35 kg m(-2) ) and 18 healthy (BMI < 25 kg m(-2) )
      volunteers participated in this case-control study. Binding activity of serum IgA
      and IgG to the cell wall mannan of S. cerevisiae was measured by enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay. More than one-third of the obese individual (35%) showed
      elevated titres of ASCA compared with the control group (5%). This antibody was
      positively associated with weight (P = 0.01), BMI (P = 0.02) and waist
      circumference (P = 0.02), but not with C-reactive protein. It seems that ASCA are
      not only specific for CD but are also associated with obesity. S. cerevisiae or a
      related antigen may play a role in the matrix of this complex condition.

TI  - Focal enhanced gastritis and macrophage microaggregates in the gastric mucosa:
      potential role in the differential diagnosis between Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis.

AB  - CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES: Focally enhanced gastritis and macrophage microaggregates
      are found in the upper gastrointestinal involvement of Crohn's disease, and may
      reflect an underlying defective innate immunity. These features, however, are
      also described in patients with Helicobacter pylori infection. The role of these 
      gastric abnormalities in the diagnosis of Crohn's disease was assessed in a
      population with high prevalence of H. pylori infection. METHODS: Thirty-seven
      Crohn's disease, 26 ulcerative colitis, and 30 control patients were included.
      The H. pylori status was evaluated by the rapid urease test and histology. The
      presence of focally enhanced gastritis and macrophage microaggregates was
      recorded. RESULTS: Focally enhanced gastritis was present in 24% of Crohn's
      disease patients, 4% of ulcerative colitis patients and 11.5% of controls,
      presenting an overall sensitivity and specificity for Crohn's disease of 24% and 
      88%, respectively. Macrophage microaggregates were found in all groups, but were 
      only detected in ulcerative colitis and controls in association with H. pylori
      infection, with an overall sensitivity and specificity for Crohn's disease of 61%
      and 69%, respectively. In the absence of H. pylori infection, focally enhanced
      gastritis and macrophage microaggregates were significantly associated with
      Crohn's disease (P<0.02 and P = 0.001 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Focally
      gastritis and macrophage microaggregates are suggestive of Crohn's disease only
      in H. pylori-negative specimens.

LID - 10.1159/000367820 [doi]
AB  - The involvement of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBD is supported by 
      many findings and is thus now commonly acknowledged. The imbalance in the
      composition of the microbiota (dysbiosis) observed in IBD patients is one of the 
      strongest arguments and provides the rationale for a therapeutic manipulation of 
      the gut microbiota. The tools available to achieve this goal include fecal
      microbiota transplantation, but antibiotics and probiotics have been the most
      used one until now. Although antibiotics have shown some efficacy in inducing
      remission in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), as well as
      preventing postoperative relapse in CD, they are not currently recommended for
      the treatment of IBD except for septic complications, notably because of
      long-term tolerance and ecological issues. Some probiotics have been shown to be 
      as good as 5-aminosalicylic acid to maintain remission in mild-to-moderate UC,
      but have been disappointing until now in CD in all tested indications. In
      pouchitis, antibiotics and probiotics have shown efficacy for inducing and
      maintaining remission, respectively. Targeting the gut microbiota in IBD is an
      attractive strategy. Current efforts to better understand the host-microbiota
      interactions in physiological as well as disease settings might lead to the
      development of rational-based treatments.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0115492 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Environmental factors during childhood are thought to play a role in 
      the aetiolgy of Crohn's Disease (CD). However the association between age at time
      of exposure and the subsequent development of CD in South Africa is unknown.
      METHODS: A case control study of all consecutive CD patients seen at 2 large
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) referral centers in the Western Cape, South
      Africa between September 2011 and January 2013 was performed. Numerous
      environmental exposures during 3 age intervals; 0-5, 6-10 and 11-18 years were
      extracted using an investigator administered questionnaire. An agreement analysis
      was performed to determine the reliability of questionnaire data for all the
      relevant variables. RESULTS: This study included 194 CD patients and 213
      controls. On multiple logistic regression analysis, a number of childhood
      environmental exposures during the 3 age interval were significantly associated
      with the risk of developing CD. During the age interval 6-10 years, never having 
      had consumed unpasteurized milk (OR = 5.84; 95% CI, 2.73-13.53) and never having 
      a donkey, horse, sheep or cow on the property (OR = 2.48; 95% CI, 1.09-5.98)
      significantly increased the risk of developing future CD. During the age interval
      11-18 years, an independent risk-association was identified for; never having
      consumed unpasteurized milk (OR = 2.60; 95% CI, 1.17-6.10) and second-hand
      cigarette smoke exposure (OR = 1.93; 95% CI, 1.13-3.35). CONCLUSION: This study
      demonstrates that both limited microbial exposures and exposure to second-hand
      cigarette smoke during childhood is associated with future development of CD.

TI  - Optimal vitamin D levels in Crohn's disease: a review.
PG  - 56-66
LID - 10.1017/S0029665114001591 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin D deficiency is common among patients with Crohn's disease. Serum
      25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) is the best measure of an individual's vitamin D
      status and current cut-off ranges for sufficiency are debatable. Several factors 
      contribute to vitamin D deficiency in Crohn's disease. These include inadequate
      exposure to sunlight, inadequate dietary intake, impaired conversion of vitamin D
      to its active metabolite, increased catabolism, increased excretion and genetic
      variants in vitamin D hydroxylation and transport. The effects of low 25(OH)D on 
      outcomes other than bone health are understudied in Crohn's disease. The aim of
      the present review is to discuss the potential roles of vitamin D and the
      possible levels required to achieve them. Emerging evidence suggests that vitamin
      D may have roles in innate and adaptive immunity, in the immune-pathogenesis of
      Crohn's disease, prevention of Crohn's disease-related hospitalisations and
      surgery, in reducing disease severity and in colon cancer prevention. The present
      literature appears to suggest that 25(OH)D concentrations of >/=75 nmol/l may be 
      required for non-skeletal effects; however, further research on optimal levels is
      required.

TI  - Vitamin D as a novel therapy in inflammatory bowel disease: new hope or false

AB  - There is increasing scientific interest in the field of vitamin D research,
      moving the focus beyond bone health to other disease processes. Low circulating
      vitamin D levels have been reported as a risk factor for several
      pathophysiologically divergent diseases, including cancers, diabetes, CVD,
      multiple sclerosis and inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and 
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). But, therein, remains the challenge: can any
      single nutrient contribute to multiple complex disease mechanisms and,
      ultimately, have therapeutic potential? The aim of this review is to critically
      evaluate several strands of scientific evidence surrounding vitamin D and
      inflammation, primarily focusing on IBD. Epidemiological studies suggest an
      increased incidence of IBD and rheumatoid arthritis in countries of more northern
      latitudes, mirroring sunlight patterns. A considerable body of evidence supports 
      the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D, at least in animal models of IBD.
      Although it is accepted that suboptimal vitamin D status is common in IBD, some
      studies suggest that this associates with more severe disease. With regard to
      treatment, the data are only beginning to emerge from randomised controlled
      trials to suggest that people with IBD may remain in remission longer when
      treated with oral vitamin D. In conclusion, several strands of evidence suggest
      that vitamin D may modify the immune response in IBD. There is a continued need
      for large well-designed clinical trials and mechanistic studies to determine if, 
      and how, this emerging promise translates into tangible clinical benefits for
      people with chronic debilitating diseases such as IBD.

AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are intestinal disorders that
      comprise the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). These disorders have a
      significant effect on the quality of life of affected patients and the increasing
      number of IBD cases worldwide is a growing concern. Because of the overall burden
      of IBD and its multifactorial etiology, efforts have been made to improve the
      medical management of these inflammatory conditions. The classical therapeutic
      strategies aim to control the exacerbated host immune response with
      aminosalicylates, antibiotics, corticosteroids, thiopurines, methotrexate and
      anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) biological agents. Although successful in the
      treatment of several CD or UC conditions, these drugs have limited effectiveness,
      and variable responses may culminate in unpredictable outcomes. The ideal therapy
      should reduce inflammation without inducing immunosuppression, and remains a
      challenge to health care personnel. Recently, a number of additional approaches
      to IBD therapy, such as new target molecules for biological agents and cellular
      therapy, have shown promising results. A deeper understanding of IBD pathogenesis
      and the availability of novel therapies are needed to improve therapeutic
      success. This review describes the overall key features of therapies currently
      employed in clinical practice as well as novel and future alternative IBD
      treatment methods.

TI  - JAK2 and AMP-kinase inhibition in vitro by food extracts, fractions and purified 
      phytochemicals.
PG  - 305-12
LID - 10.1039/c4fo00626g [doi]
AB  - We have identified a range of food phytochemicals that inhibit Janus Kinase 2
      (JAK2) and Adenosine Monophosphate Kinase (AMPK). A mutated and dysregulated form
      of JAK2, a tyrosine kinase, is associated with several diseases including Crohn's
      disease. Using an in vitro, time-resolved fluorescence (TR-FRET) assay, we tested
      49 different types of food extracts, plus 10 concentrated fractions of increasing
      hydrophobicity from each extract, to find foods containing JAK2 inhibitors. The
      food extracts tested included grains, meat, fish, shellfish, dairy products,
      herbs, mushrooms, hops, fruits and vegetables. Several fruits were potent
      inhibitors of JAK2: blackberry, boysenberry, feijoa, pomegranate, rosehip and
      strawberry, which all contain ellagitannins, known inhibitors of kinases. These
      fruits are in the Rosales and Myrtales plant orders. No other foods gave >1% of
      the maximal JAK2 inhibitory activities of these fruits. AMPK, a sensor and
      regulator of energy metabolism in cells, is a serine-threonine kinase which is
      reported to be activated by various flavonoid phytochemicals. Using a TR-FRET
      assay, we tested various fruit extracts for AMPK activation and inhibition.
      Ellagitannin containing foods scored highly as AMPK inhibitors. Despite several
      reports of AMPK activation in whole cells by phytochemicals, no extracts or pure 
      compounds activated AMPK in our assay.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Probiotic formulations of single species of bacteria have not 
      been effective in preventing the recurrence of Crohn's disease after surgery. We 
      investigated the ability of VSL#3, a mixture of 8 different bacterial probiotic
      species, to prevent Crohn's disease recurrence after surgery in a multicenter,
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. METHODS: Within 30 days of
      ileocolonic resection and re-anastomosis, patients with Crohn's disease were
      randomly assigned to groups given 1 sachet of VSL#3 (900 billion viable bacteria,
      comprising 4 strains of Lactobacillus, 3 strains of Bifidobacterium, and 1 strain
      of Streptococcus salivarius subspecies thermophilus) (n = 59) or matching placebo
      (n = 60). Colonoscopy was performed at days 90 and 365 to evaluate the
      neoterminal ileum for disease recurrence and obtain mucosal biopsies for cytokine
      analysis. Patients from both groups with either no or mild endoscopic recurrence 
      at day 90 received VSL#3 until day 365. The primary outcome was the proportion of
      patients with severe endoscopic recurrence at day 90. RESULTS: At day 90, the
      proportion of patients with severe endoscopic lesions did not differ
      significantly between VSL#3 (9.3%) and placebo (15.7%, P = .19). The proportions 
      of patients with non-severe lesions at day 90 who had severe endoscopic
      recurrence at day 365 were 10.0% in the early VSL#3 group (given VSL#3 for the
      entire 365 days) and 26.7% in the late VSL#3 group (given VSL#3 from days 90
      through 365) (P = .09). Aggregate rates of severe recurrence (on days 90 and 365)
      were not statistically different, 20.5% of subjects in the early VSL#3 group and 
      42.1% in the late VSL#3 group. Patients receiving VSL#3 had reduced mucosal
      inflammatory cytokine levels compared with placebo at day 90 (P < .05). Crohn's
      disease activity index and inflammatory bowel disease quality of life scores were
      similar in the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: There were no statistical differences in
      endoscopic recurrence rates at day 90 between patients who received VSL#3 and
      patients who received placebo. Lower mucosal levels of inflammatory cytokines and
      a lower rate of recurrence among patients who received early VSL#3 (for the
      entire 365 days) indicate that this probiotic should be further investigated for 
      prevention of Crohn's disease recurrence. Clinical trials.gov number:

      subjective global assessment (SGA) were recorded. At stage 2, the patients were
      blindly randomized into a Study Group and Controls. In the Study Group, a
      standard enteral product was added into the regulated hospital diets, but for the
      Controls, deficits were regulated by only hospital diets for 3 weeks. the
      independent variables were the group, the disease and its activity, age, Body
      body mass index (BMI), weight loss history, the hospitalization period; the
      dependent variables were SGA, bowel movements, change in nutritional status,
      disease severity, clinical findings, and also consumption of macronutrients.
      RESULTS: Prevalance of malnutrition (SGA-B or SGA-C) for all the patients was
      92.1% at the beginning and 71.1% at the end of study. Improvements in disease
      activity score for the patients with UC were statistically significant in both
      the Study Group and the Controls (p=0.006 for the Study Group and p=0.001 for the
      Controls, respectively). Macronutrients, total and water soluble fiber
      consumption levels improved, with statistically significant differences for all
      the groups. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of malnutrition is a major problem in
      patients with IBD. Not only the regulation of hospital food, but also enteral
      nutritional support, improved their levels of malnutrition, as well as their
      energy, macronutrients, and fiber consumption, and SGA is an easy method for
      nutritional monitoring.

TI  - Multiple micronutrient supplementation transiently ameliorates environmental
      enteropathy in Malawian children aged 12-35 months in a randomized controlled
      clinical trial.
PG  - 2059-65
LID - 10.3945/jn.114.201673 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Environmental enteropathy (EE) is subclinical, diffuse villous
      atrophy characterized by T cell infiltration of the small intestinal mucosa
      associated with nutrient malabsorption and stunting. EE is assessed by the
      lactulose:mannitol (L:M) test, whereby nonmetabolized sugars are ingested and
      quantified in the urine. Multiple micronutrient (MN) deficiency morphologically
      mimics EE, and omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids reduce mucosal
      inflammation in Crohn disease. OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that
      supplementary MNs, with or without fish oil (FO), would improve L:M in rural
      Malawian children aged 1-3 y compared with a control (C) group receiving a
      placebo. METHODS: The MNs and FO provided the Recommended Dietary Intake for 26
      vitamins, minerals, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid. This was a
      3-arm, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, with the
      primary outcomes being the change in L:M (DeltaL:M) after 12 and 24 wk of
      supplementation. Comparisons were made for DeltaL:M after 12 and 24 wk within
      each group by using a Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test, because the data
      are not normally distributed. RESULTS: A total of 230 children had specimens
      adequate for analysis; all had an abnormal baseline L:M, defined as >0.10. After 
      12 wk, children who received MNs + FO had a DeltaL:M [mean (95% CI)] of -0.10
      (-0.04, -0.15; P = 0.001), and children receiving only MNs had DeltaL:M of -0.12 
      (-0.03, -0.21; P = 0.002). After 24 wk, children who received MNs + FO had a
      DeltaL:M of -0.09 (-0.03, -0.15; P = 0.001); children receiving only MNs had a
      DeltaL:M of -0.11 (-0.02, -0.20; P = 0.001), and the C group had DeltaL:M of
      -0.07 (0.02, -0.16); P = 0.002). Linear growth was similar in all groups,
      approximately 4.3 cm over 24 wk. CONCLUSION: Although the effect was modest,
      these data suggest MNs can transiently ameliorate EE in rural African children.
      The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01593033.

TI  - Higher vitamin D serum concentration increases health related quality of life in 
      patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.

LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i42.15787 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To investigate the effect of vitamin D (VD) concentrations and VD
      supplementation on health related quality of life in inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) patients. METHODS: A cohort of 220 IBD patients including 141 Crohn's
      disease (CD) and 79 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients was followed-up at a
      tertiary IBD center. A subgroup of the cohort (n = 26) took VD supplements for > 
      3 mo. Health related quality of life was assessed using the short IBD
      questionnaire (sIBDQ). VD serum concentration and sIBDQ score were assessed
      between August and October 2012 (summer/autumn period) and between February and
      April 2013 (winter/spring period). The mean VD serum concentration and its
      correlation with disease activity of CD were determined for each season
      separately. In a subgroup of patients, the effects of VD supplementation on
      winter VD serum concentration, change in VD serum concentration from summer to
      winter, and winter sIBDQ score were analyzed. RESULTS: During the summer/autumn
      and the winter/spring period, 28% and 42% of IBD patients were VD-deficient (< 20
      ng/mL), respectively. In the winter/spring period, there was a significant
      correlation between sIBDQ score and VD serum concentration in UC patients (r =
      0.35, P = 0.02), with a trend towards significance in CD patients (r = 0.17, P = 
      0.06). In the winter/spring period, VD-insufficient patients (< 30 ng/mL) had a
      significantly lower mean sIBDQ score than VD-sufficient patients; this was true
      of both UC (48.3 +/- 2.3 vs 56.7 +/- 3.4, P = 0.04) and CD (55.7 +/- 1.25 vs 60.8
      +/- 2.14, P = 0.04) patients. In all analyzed scenarios (UC/CD, the summer/autumn
      period and the winter/spring period), health related quality of life was the
      highest in patients with VD serum concentrations of 50-59 ng/mL. Supplementation 
      with a median of 800 IU/d VD day did not influence VD serum concentration or the 
      sIBDQ score. CONCLUSION: VD serum concentration correlated with health related
      quality of life in UC and CD patients during the winter/spring period.

      diseases].
PG  - 1251-6
LID - 10.5604/17322693.1127882 [doi]
AB  - In this paper a review of the researches on the role of Escherichia coli strain
      Nissle 1917 (EcN) in gastrointestinal diseases was presented. EcN is a
      non-pathogenic strain of the Enterobacteriaceae family, which has probiotic
      properties. In a number of studies conducted among humans and experimental
      animals the application of EcN in treatment of gastrointestinal diseases was
      observed. Most studies about EcN has been devoted to this organism efficacy in
      ulcerative colitis treatment. Comparable results were obtained, by citied
      authors, in the treatment (sustaining remission) of EcN and mesalazine in
      ulcerative colitis. Moreover, this probiotic therapy, compared to placebo,
      contributes to obtaining a faster remission and improvement of intestinal
      histopathology. The use of EcN in Crohn's disease has not been the subject of as 
      many studies as in the case of ulcerative colitis. Assessing the importance of
      EcN in treatment of other gastrointestinal disorders, authors of the studies
      observed, that in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, who receiving this
      probiotic there was a pain, nausea and bloating reduction. In studies conducted
      among children a positive impact of EcN in prevention and treatment of diarrhea
      was demonstrated. Similar results were obtained in studies conducted in
      experimental animals. Based on the presented review it can be concluded that the 
      strain of Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 is useful in treatment of gastrointestinal
      diseases, especially in treatment of ulcerative colitis. This probiotic may
      constitute a part of treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and diarrhea. The
      effectiveness of this strain in treatment of Crohn's disease is not clearly
      established and further research are require.

      months follow-up. Anaemia was defined as Hb < -2 sd, while severe anaemia was
      defined as Hb < -4 sd. Patients were classified as child </=13 and adolescent >13
      years of age. RESULT: Ninety-six were included, 13 dropped out due to
      insufficient Hb data (37 females/46 males; median age 13.3 years, range 2.2-17.8 
      years). At diagnosis, the median Hb sd was -2.66 (-8.4; 1.07) and was correlated 
      with the PCDAI (p = 0.013). At diagnosis, 51/83 (61%) were anaemic and all had
      active disease. Hb z-score significantly improved (p < 0.0001) but 26/68 (38%)
      remained anaemic at 12 months and 29/76 (38%) at 24 months of follow-up. The
      correlation to the PCDAI disappeared. At 24 months, children were more likely to 
      be anaemic. There was no difference in iron dose nor duration of iron supplements
      between children and adolescents. Iron treatment was more readily given to
      patients presenting with anaemia. Hb did not differ between patients with (n =
      28) or without iron supplements. Half of the patients with persisting anaemia
      were given iron supplements, of which, only three were given intravenously.
      CONCLUSION: Anaemia remains an important extra-intestinal manifestation of CD in 
      children. Physicians, lacking optimal treatment strategies, undertreat their
      patients.

PG  - 10-6
LID - 10.3892/ijmm.2014.1981 [doi]
AB  - The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease, 
      is a subject of increasing interest. Loss-of-function mutations in
      nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) are strong 
      genetic factors linked to Crohn's disease, which eventually leads to an excessive
      mucosal inflammatory response directed against components of normal gut
      microbiota. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in inflammation 
      processes, as well as in transduction of signals from receptors for several
      cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). ROS activate nuclear
      factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) via IkappaB kinase (IKK) through the PI3K/AKT/PTEN
      pathway. Therefore, this pathway is recognized to play a key role in Crohn's
      disease. Loss of function has been demonstrated to occur as an early event in a
      wide variety of diseases. Given this prevalent involvement in a number of
      diseases, the molecular development that modulates this pathway has been the
      subject of several studies. In addition, it has been the focus of extensive
      research and drug discovery activities. A better understanding of the molecular
      assemblies may reveal novel targets for the therapeutic development against
      Crohn's disease.

TI  - A retrospective analysis: the development of patient reported outcome measures
      for the assessment of Crohn's disease activity.
PG  - 77-86
LID - 10.1111/apt.13001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is a measure of disease
      activity based on symptoms, signs and a laboratory test. The US Food and Drug
      Administration has indicated that patient reported outcomes (PROs) should be the 
      primary outcome in randomised controlled trials for Crohn's disease (CD). AIM: As
      no validated PRO exists for CD, to investigate whether CDAI diary card items
      could be modified for this purpose. METHODS: Data from a trial of
      rifaximin-extended intestinal release were used to identify cut-points for stool 
      frequency, pain and general well-being using receiver operating characteristic
      curves with CDAI <150 as criterion. The operating properties of 2- and 3-item PRO
      were evaluated using data from a trial of methotrexate in CD. Regression analysis
      determined PRO2 and PRO3 scores that correspond to CDAI-defined thresholds of
      150, 220 and 450 and changes of 50, 70 and 100 points. RESULTS: Optimum
      cut-points for CDAI remission were mean daily stool frequency </=1.5, abdominal
      pain </=1, and general well-being score of </=1 (areas under the ROC curve 0.79, 
      0.91 and 0.89, respectively). The effect estimates were similar using 2- and
      3-item PROs or CDAI. PRO2 and PRO3 values corresponding to CDAI scores of 150,
      220 and 450 points were 8, 14, 34 and 13, 22, 53. The corresponding values for
      CDAI changes of 50, 70 and 100, were 2, 5, 8 and 5, 9, 14. Responsiveness to
      change was similar for both PROs. CONCLUSION: Patient reported outcomes derived
      from CDAI diary items may be appropriate for use in clinical trials for CD.

TI  - Carbohydrate intake in the etiology of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 2013-21
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000168 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diet may have a role in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease.
      In previous studies, the associations between increased intakes of carbohydrates,
      sugar, starch, and inflammatory bowel disease are inconsistent. However, few
      prospective studies have investigated the associations between these
      macronutrients and incident Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC).
      METHODS: A total of 401,326 men and women were recruited between 1991 and 1998.
      At recruitment, dietary intakes of carbohydrate, sugar, and starch were measured 
      using validated food frequency questionnaires. The cohort was monitored
      identifying participants who developed incident CD or UC. Cases were matched with
      4 controls, and odds ratios were calculated for quintiles of total carbohydrate, 
      sugar, and starch intakes adjusted for total energy intake, body mass index, and 
      smoking. RESULTS: One hundred ten participants developed CD, and 244 participants
      developed UC during follow-up. The adjusted odds ratio for the highest versus the
      lowest quintiles of total carbohydrate intake for CD was 0.87, 95% CI = 0.24 to
      3.12 and for UC 1.46, 95% CI = 0.62 to 3.46, with no significant trends across
      quintiles for either (CD, P trend = 0.70; UC, P trend = 0.41). Similarly, no
      associations were observed with intakes of total sugar (CD, P trend = 0.50; UC, P
      trend = 0.71) or starch (CD, P trend = 0.69; UC, P trend = 0.17). CONCLUSIONS:
      The lack of associations with these nutrients is in agreement with many
      case-control studies that have not identified associations with CD or UC. As
      there is biological plausibility for how specific carbohydrates could have an
      etiological role in inflammatory bowel disease, future epidemiological work
      should assess individual carbohydrates, although there does not seem to be a
      macronutrient effect.

TI  - The use of probiotics in IBD and IBS.
PG  - 491-500
AB  - While the role of microflora is well established in the development of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBS); data is still emerging regarding IBS as the
      knowledge on brain-gut interaction grows. For both patient groups multiple
      efficacious treatments exist, but there are still unmet needs as long term
      disease control remains an issue. Given the importance of the microbiome on the
      development of the immune system and the interaction between the microbiome and
      the host organism, this "route" is being examined increasingly as a therapeutic

AB  - Important advances during the last decade have been made in understanding the
      complex etiopathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). While many gaps in our
      knowledge still exist, it has been suggested that the etiology of CD is
      multifactorial including genetic, environmental and infectious factors. The most 
      widely accepted theory states that CD is caused by an aggressive immune response 
      to infectious agents in genetically predisposed individuals. The rise of
      genome-wide association studies allowed the identification of loci and genetic
      variants in several components of host innate and adaptive immune responses to
      microorganisms in the gut, highlighting an implication of intestinal microbiota
      in CD etiology. Moreover, numerous independent studies reported a dysbiosis,
      i.e., a modification of intestinal microbiota composition, with an imbalance
      between the abundance of beneficial and harmful bacteria. Although microorganisms
      including viruses, yeasts, fungi and bacteria have been postulated as potential
      CD pathogens, based on epidemiological, clinicopathological, genetic and
      experimental evidence, their precise role in this disease is not clearly defined.
      This review summarizes the current knowledge of the infectious agents associated 
      with an increased risk of developing CD. Therapeutic approaches to modulate the
      intestinal dysbiosis and to target the putative CD-associated pathogens, as well 
      as their potential mechanisms of action are also discussed.

AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) is a complex inherited disorder of unknown pathogenesis.
      Recent evidence suggests that CD may involve genetic or environmental factors
      that impair the normal innate immune system's ability to contain bacteria to the 
      lumen. Multiple dietary components may impact on the resident flora, diminish or 
      damage the mucous layer, increase intestinal permeability or increase the ability
      of pathobionts to adhere to epithelial cells or translocate across the epithelial
      barrier. This chapter reviews the possible effects of different dietary
      components present in the Western diet to affect bacterial clearance mechanisms, 
      and offers a hypothetical model for an acquired bacterial clearance defect in CD.

PG  - 115-23

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disorders (IBD) are characterized by chronic and recurrent
      inflammatory reactions of the intestinal mucosa resulting in progressing
      ulcerating lesions. Research over the past decade clearly identified in patients 
      with Crohn's disease (CD) a marked dysregulation of the intestinal microbiome
      (dysbiosis) as one trigger factor in these inflammatory processes, particularly
      in patients with a high genetic risk. When treating patients with CD, most drugs 
      aim to control the inflammatory process (either by inhibiting inflammatory
      pathways or by reducing the activity of immune cells). Given the importance of
      the disturbed interaction between the microbiota and the host immune system,
      there might be a different therapeutic approach in targeting directly the
      intestinal microflora. There are good data to believe that the use of exclusive
      enteral nutrition (EEN) is one such option. Historically, enteral nutrition (EN) 
      was used as supplemental nutritional therapy in CD patients with planned
      resection surgery. This treatment option showed unexpected and very powerful
      anti-inflammatory effects, and it was rapidly introduced as induction therapy for
      active CD. Several clinical trials and case series confirmed the efficacy of EN
      to induce remission in approximately 80% of patients equaling the potential of
      steroids. It is well established that EN has this strong anti-inflammatory
      potential only when given on an exclusive basis, without any additional food.
      This raises major compliance issues, probably one of the reasons why it is less
      used in adult patients. A recent study demonstrated that EEN has a specific
      effect on the intestinal microbiota, which is markedly different from
      steroid-induced remission, while all patients obtained complete clinical
      remission. These observations give a first basis for the understanding of the
      impact of EEN on dysbiosis in patients with CD.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0106750 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with a defective
      intestinal barrier and enhanced adaptive immune responses against commensal
      microbiota. Immune responses against food antigens in IBD patients remain poorly 
      defined. METHODS: IgG and IgA specific for food and microfloral antigens (wheat
      and milk extracts; purified ovalbumin; Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis 
      lysates; mannan from Saccharomyces cerevisiae) were analyzed by ELISA in the
      serum and feces of patients with Crohn's disease (CD; n = 52 for serum and n = 20
      for feces), ulcerative colitis (UC; n = 29; n = 17), acute
      gastroenteritis/colitis (AGE; n = 12; n = 9) as well as non-inflammatory controls
      (n = 61; n = 39). RESULTS: Serum anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) 
      and anti-B. fragilis IgG and IgA levels were increased in CD patients whereas
      antibody (Ab) levels against E. coli and food antigens were not significantly
      different within the patient groups and controls. Subgroup analysis revealed that
      CD patients with severe diseases defined by stricturing and penetrating lesions
      have slightly higher anti-food and anti-microbial IgA levels whereas CD and UC
      patients with arthropathy have decreased anti-food IgG levels. Treatment with
      anti-TNF-alpha Abs in CD patients was associated with significantly decreased
      ASCA IgG and IgA and anti-E. coli IgG. In the feces specific IgG levels against
      all antigens were higher in CD and AGE patients while specific IgA levels were
      higher in non-IBD patients. Anti-food IgG and IgA levels did not correlate with
      food intolerance. SUMMARY: In contrast to anti-microbial Abs, we found only minor
      changes in serum anti-food Ab levels in specific subgroups of IBD patients. Fecal
      Ab levels towards microbial and food antigens show distinct patterns in controls,
      CD and UC patients.

PG  - 11505-24
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i33.11505 [doi]
AB  - It has been presumed that aberrant immune response to intestinal microorganisms
      in genetically predisposed individuals may play a major role in the pathogenesis 
      of the inflammatory bowel disease, and there is a good deal of evidence
      supporting this hypothesis. Commensal enteric bacteria probably play a central
      role in pathogenesis, providing continuous antigenic stimulation that causes
      chronic intestinal injury. A strong biologic rationale supports the use of
      probiotics and prebiotics for inflammatory bowel disease therapy. Many probiotic 
      strains exhibit anti-inflammatory properties through their effects on different
      immune cells, pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion depression, and the induction
      of anti-inflammatory cytokines. There is very strong evidence supporting the use 
      of multispecies probiotic VSL#3 for the prevention or recurrence of postoperative
      pouchitis in patients. For treatment of active ulcerative colitis, as well as for
      maintenance therapy, the clinical evidence of efficacy is strongest for VSL#3 and
      Escherichia coli Nissle 1917. Moreover, some prebiotics, such as germinated
      barley foodstuff, Psyllium or oligofructose-enriched inulin, might provide some
      benefit in patients with active ulcerative colitis or ulcerative colitis in
      remission. The results of clinical trials in the treatment of active Crohn's
      disease or the maintenance of its remission with probiotics and prebiotics are
      disappointing and do not support their use in this disease. The only exception is
      weak evidence of advantageous use of Saccharomyces boulardii concomitantly with
      medical therapy in maintenance treatment.

AB  - Although epidemiological findings support a role for vitamin K status in the
      improvement of bone indices in adult patients with Crohn's disease (CD), this
      needs to be confirmed in double-blind, randomised controlled trials (RCT) with
      phylloquinone (vitamin K1). By conducting two RCT, the present study aimed to
      first establish whether supplementation with 1000 mug of phylloquinone daily
      near-maximally suppresses the percentage of undercarboxylated osteocalcin in
      serum (%ucOC; marker of vitamin K status) in adult patients with CD currently in 
      remission as it does in healthy adults and second determine the effect of
      supplementation with phylloquinone at this dose for 12 months on the indices of
      bone turnover and bone mass. The initial dose-ranging RCT was conducted in adult 
      patients with CD (n 10 per group) using 0 (placebo), 1000 or 2000 mug of
      phylloquinone daily for 2 weeks. In the main RCT, the effect of placebo v. 1000
      mug vitamin K/d (both co-administered with Ca (500 mg/d) and vitamin D3 (10
      mug/d)) for 12 months (n 43 per group) on the biochemical indices of bone
      turnover (determined by enzyme immunoassay) and bone mass (determined by
      dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) were investigated. At baseline, the mean %ucOC 
      was 47 %, and this was suppressed upon supplementation with 1000 mug of
      phylloquinone daily ( - 81 %; P< 0.01) and not suppressed further by 2000 mug of 
      phylloquinone daily. Compared with the placebo, supplementation with 1000 mug of 
      phylloquinone daily for 12 months had no significant effect (P>0.1) on bone
      turnover markers or on the bone mass of the lumbar spine or femur, but modestly
      increased (P< 0.05) the bone mass of the total radius. Despite near maximal
      suppression of serum %ucOC, supplementation with 1000 mug of phylloquinone daily 
      (with Ca and vitamin D3) had no effect on the indices of bone health in adult CD 
      patients with likely vitamin K insufficiency.

TI  - Homocysteine in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 189-92
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hyperhomocysteinemia seems to be a common phenomenon in both patients
      with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Many factors including deficiencies 
      of cobalamin, folate and pyridoxine, smoking habits, alcohol and coffee intake,
      some medications and age may predispose subjects to hyperhomocysteinemia. The
      study aimed to evaluate homocysteine levels in an inflammatory bowel disease
      cohort as dependent of life style and disease activity. METHODS: 85 consecutive
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease (38 with Crohn's disease and 47 with
      ulcerative colitis) and 65 control subjects were included in the prospective
      study. The following parameters were analyzed: disease activity, duration of the 
      disease, location of pathological changes, presence of complications, current
      medications, past surgical procedures, smoking history, concomitant diseases,
      biochemical parameters and plasma homocysteine levels. RESULTS: Mild
      hyperhomocysteinemia was found in 16 patients with Crohn's disease (42%), 19
      patients with ulcerative colitis (40%) and 19 patients in the control group (29%)
      (p = 0.59). There was not any significant correlation between homocysteine level 
      and disease activity. Only folic acid supplementation and gender affected
      homocysteine level. Folic acid intake led to reduction of homocysteine levels in 
      all groups of patients (11.8 micromol/l vs. 8.33 miccromol/l, p = 0.0065 in
      Crohn's disease patients and 10.94 micromol/l vs. 7.78 micromol/l, p = 0.0069 in 
      ulcerative colitis patients). CONCLUSION: Homocysteine level in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease is mostly normal or slightly elevated. Disease
      activity does not have an impact on homocysteine level. Folic acid is the most
      important factor having an influence on homocysteine level in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Gut microbiota and inflammatory bowel disease: the role of antibiotics in disease
      management.
PG  - 7-19
LID - 10.3810/pgm.2014.07.2779 [doi]
AB  - Imbalances in the composition and number of bacteria in the gut microbiota have
      been implicated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and modulation of the gut
      microbiota by probiotics and antibiotics in IBD has been an active area of
      research, with mixed results. This narrative review summarizes the findings of
      relevant publications identified using the PubMed database. Although antibiotics 
      have been associated with an increased risk of IBD development and flares,
      several meta-analyses demonstrate that antibiotics are efficacious for the
      induction of remission and treatment of flares in patients with IBD. Data
      supporting their use include a large number of antibiotic studies in Crohn's
      disease and evidence suggests antibiotics are efficacious in both Crohn's disease
      and ulcerative colitis, although there are fewer studies of the latter. For
      Crohn's disease, antibiotics have been shown to be useful for the induction of
      remission and in the postoperative management of patients undergoing surgery.
      Additionally, patients with fistulizing disease, particularly perianal, can
      benefit from antibiotics administered short term. Both antimicrobials and
      probiotics have been shown to be useful for the treatment of pouchitis.
      Additional randomized controlled trials are needed to further elucidate the role 
      of bacteria in IBD and to better inform clinicians about appropriate antibiotic
      therapies.

AB  - Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) is the causative agent of
      paratuberculosis (Johne's disease [JD]), a chronic granulomatous enteritis in
      ruminants. JD is one of the most widespread bacterial diseases of domestic
      animals with significant economic impact. The histopathological picture of JD
      resembles that of Crohn's disease (CD), a human chronic inflammatory bowel
      disease of still unresolved aetiology. An aetiological relevance of MAP for CD
      has been proposed. This and the ambiguity of other published epidemiological
      findings raise the question whether MAP represents a zoonotic agent. In this
      review, we will discuss evidence that MAP has zoonotic capacity.

AB  - It is important to have clear goals for treating inflammatory bowel disease in
      clinical practice and in research. Conventional end points for trials in
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease have been based on composite indices, such
      as the Mayo Clinic Score and the Crohn's Disease Activity Index; these indices
      incorporate symptoms, signs, and findings from laboratory tests and sometimes
      endoscopic assessments. Although definitions of clinical response and remission
      have been based on these indices for regulatory purposes, they are difficult to
      apply to practice because they are complex and not intuitive to clinicians. This 
      has caused a disconnect between clinical trials and practice. Recently, the use
      of composite indices in trials has been reevaluated in Food and Drug
      Administration-sponsored Gastroenterology Regulatory Endpoints and the
      Advancement of Therapeutics workshops due to concerns about the validity of the
      indices. Alternative measures of outcome and definitions of response are being
      developed. Patient-reported outcomes are psychometric instruments created and
      defined by patients to quantify symptoms. A combination of end points, comprising
      patient-reported outcomes and objective evaluation of inflammation by endoscopy, 
      offers a clinically meaningful and scientifically valid alternative to existing
      composite indices. Unlike composite indices, response definitions based on
      endoscopy and patient-reported outcomes can be readily applied in practice. This 
      convergence of outcome assessment in clinical trials and practice could expedite 
      implementation of "treat-to-target" algorithms, in which therapy is progressively
      intensified until a specific treatment goal is reached. This approach could
      improve patient care by reducing rates of disease-related complications, surgery,
      and hospitalization.

      mouse model of colitis. METHODS: We enrolled 98 CD patients, 50 ulcerative
      colitis patients, and 52 healthy controls (HCs) to compare the levels of serum
      immunoglobulin (Ig)Gs against 88 foods. The presence of serum IgGs against foods 
      was also examined in interleukin (IL)-10 knockout (KO) mice in which CD4(+) T
      cell activation by antigenic food protein was assessed. Mice transferred with
      IL-10 KO cells received diets with or without food antigens, and the development 
      of colitis was evaluated. RESULTS: The prevalence of IgGs against various foods, 
      especially vegetables, grains, and nuts, was significantly higher in CD patients 
      than in HCs. Similarly, the prevalence of IgGs against food proteins was higher
      in IL-10 KO mice than in BALB/c mice. Beta-conglycinin, identified as an
      antigenic food proteins in IL-10 KO mice, induced CD4(+) T cell production of
      interferon-gamma and IL-17 through dendritic cell antigen presentation.
      Elimination of the food antigens ameliorated the development of colitis in mice
      without altering the composition of their intestinal microbiota. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      CD colitis mice, intestinal inflammation via CD4(+) T cell hyperactivation was
      induced by food antigens associated with high serum IgG levels and was
      ameliorated by the elimination of food antigens. This disrupted immunological
      tolerance to food antigen, which might act as an exacerbating factor, remains to 
      be elucidated in CD patients.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease affects a substantial number of women in their
      reproductive years. Pregnancy presents a number of challenges for clinicians and 
      patients; the health of the baby needs to be balanced with the need to maintain
      remission in the mother. Historically, treatments for Crohn's disease (CD) were
      often discontinued during the pregnancy, or nursing period, due to concerns about
      teratogenicity. Fortunately, observational data has reported the relative safety 
      of many agents used to treat CD, including 5-aminosalicylic acid, thiopurines,
      and tumor necrosis factor. Data on the long-term development outcomes of children
      exposed to these therapies in utero are still limited. It is most important that 
      physicians educate the patient regarding the optimal time to conceive, discuss
      the possible risks, and together decide on the best management strategy.

TI  - Diet, microbiota, and inflammatory bowel disease: lessons from Japanese foods.
PG  - 409-15
LID - 10.3904/kjim.2014.29.4.409 [doi]
AB  - The incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) including
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease are rapidly increasing in Western countries 
      and in developed Asian countries. Although biologic agents targeting the immune
      system have been effective in patients with IBD, cessation of treatment leads to 
      relapse in the majority of patients, suggesting that intrinsic immune
      dysregulation is an effect, not a cause, of IBD. Dramatic changes in the
      environment, resulting in the dysregulated composition of intestinal microbiota
      or dysbiosis, may be associated with the fundamental causes of IBD. Japan now has
      upgraded water supply and sewerage systems, as well as dietary habits and
      antibiotic overuse that are similar to such features found in developed Western
      countries. The purpose of this review article was to describe the association of 
      diet, particularly Japanese food and microbiota, with IBD.

TI  - Intractable diarrhea of infancy: 10 years of experience.
PG  - 571-6
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000485 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Intractable diarrhea of infancy (IDI), a group of prolonged diarrheal
      disorders, is difficult to diagnose and manage. We documented general features of
      patients and the causes of IDI. METHODS: The present retrospective study included
      60 hospitalized patients with IDI ages 0 to 24 months during January 2000 to
      December 2010. Detailed history, laboratory and endoscopic findings, diagnoses,
      and clinical courses were reviewed. Descriptive analyses were used for
      statistical evaluation. RESULTS: The male/female ratio was 1.4. The median age at
      onset of diarrhea was 12 days. A total of 70% and 11% of patients were severely
      and moderately malnourished, respectively. Carbohydrate malabsorption (CM) and
      food allergies (n = 11, 18% for both) were the most frequent causes. A total of
      16 of the patients (27%) did not have a specific diagnosis. The other diagnoses
      were infections (n = 5), immune-mediated disorders (IMD) (n = 6), congenital
      enterocyte defects (CED) (n = 3, 5%), short bowel syndrome (n = 2), cystic
      fibrosis (n = 2), intestinal pseudoobstruction (n = 1), congenital disorder of
      glycosylation (n = 1), abetalipoproteinemia (n = 1), and proprotein convertase
      (PC) 1 deficiency (n = 1). Stool calprotectin level was high in 10 of 19 patients
      with Crohn disease (n = 3, mean 1116 +/- 851 mg/L), food allergy (n = 4, mean 516
      +/- 288 mg/L), and undefined etiology (n = 3, mean 616 +/- 780 mg/L). The mean
      duration of hospitalization was 76 days. CONCLUSIONS: IDI is a heterogeneous
      group of diarrheal disorders. The most frequent causes were CM and food allergies
      in our study. Because high levels of calprotectin support inflammation,
      calprotectin levels may help to discriminate CED and inflammatory causes of IDI.

PG  - 351204
LID - 10.1155/2014/351204 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an autoimmune disease characterized by a
      chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract mucosa and is related to an
      abnormal immune response to commensal bacteria. Our aim of the present work has
      been to explore the levels of antibodies (IgG and IgA) raised against
      extracellular proteins produced by LAB and its association with IBD. We analyzed,
      by Western-blot and ELISA, the presence of serum antibodies (IgA and IgG)
      developed against extracellular protein fractions produced by different food
      bacteria from the genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. We used a sera
      collection consisting of healthy individuals (HC, n = 50), Crohn's disease
      patients (CD, n = 37), and ulcerative colitis patients (UC, n = 15). Levels of
      IgA antibodies developed against a cell-wall hydrolase from Lactobacillus casei
      subsp. rhamnosus GG (CWH) were significantly higher in the IBD group (P < 0.002; 
      n = 52). The specificity of our measurements was confirmed by measuring IgA
      antibodies developed against the CWH peptide 365-VNTSNQTAAVSAS-377. IBD patients 
      appeared to have different immune response to food bacteria. This paper sets the 
      basis for developing systems for early detection of IBD, based on the association
      of high levels of antibodies developed against extracellular proteins from food
      and probiotic bacteria.

TI  - Partial enteral nutrition with a Crohn's disease exclusion diet is effective for 
      induction of remission in children and young adults with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1353-60
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000110 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Exclusive enteral nutrition is effective for inducing remission in
      active pediatric Crohn's disease. Partial enteral nutrition (PEN) with free diet 
      is ineffective for inducing remission, suggesting that the mechanism depends on
      exclusion of free diet. We developed an alternative diet based on PEN with
      exclusion of dietary components hypothesized to affect the microbiome or
      intestinal permeability. METHODS: Children and young adults with active disease
      defined as a pediatric Crohn's disease activity index >7.5 or Harvey-Bradshaw
      index >/=4 received a 6-week structured Crohn's disease exclusion diet that
      allowed access to specific foods and restricted exposure to all other foods, and 
      up to 50% of dietary calories from a polymeric formula. Remission, C-reactive
      protien, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were reevaluated at 6 weeks. The
      primary endpoint was remission at 6 weeks defined as Harvey-Bradshaw index </=3
      for all patients and pediatric Crohn's disease activity index <7.5 in children.
      RESULTS: We treated 47 patients (mean age, 16.1 +/- 5.6 yr; 34 children).
      Response and remission were obtained in 37 (78.7%) and 33 (70.2%) patients,
      respectively. Mean pediatric Crohn's disease activity index decreased from 27.7
      +/- 9.4 to 5.4 +/- 8 (P < 0.001), Harvey-Bradshaw index from 6.4 +/- 2.7 to 1.8
      +/- 2.9 (P < 0.001). Remission was obtained in 70% of children and 69% of adults.
      Normalization of previously elevated CRP occurred in 21 of 30 (70%) patients in
      remission. Seven patients used the diet without PEN; 6 of 7 obtained remission.
      CONCLUSIONS: Dietary therapy involving PEN with an exclusion diet seems to lead
      to high remission rates in early mild-to-moderate luminal Crohn's disease in
      children and young adults.

TI  - Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis causes Crohn's disease in some
      inflammatory bowel disease patients.
PG  - 7403-15
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i23.7403 [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory condition that plagues millions
      all over the world. This debilitating bowel disease can start in early childhood 
      and continue into late adulthood. Signs and symptoms are usually many and
      multiple tests are often required for the diagnosis and confirmation of this
      disease. However, little is still understood about the cause(s) of CD. As a
      result, several theories have been proposed over the years. One theory in
      particular is that Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) is
      intimately linked to the etiology of CD. This fastidious bacterium also known to 
      cause Johne's disease in cattle has infected the intestines of animals for years.
      It is believed that due to the thick, waxy cell wall of MAP it is able to survive
      the process of pasteurization as well as chemical processes seen in irrigation
      purification systems. Subsequently meat, dairy products and water serve as key
      vehicles in the transmission of MAP infection to humans (from farm to fork) who
      have a genetic predisposition, thus leading to the development of CD. The
      challenges faced in culturing this bacterium from CD are many. Examples include
      its extreme slow growth, lack of cell wall, low abundance, and its mycobactin
      dependency. In this review article, data from 60 studies showing the detection
      and isolation of MAP by PCR and culture techniques have been reviewed. Although
      this review may not be 100% comprehensive of all studies, clearly the majority of
      the studies overwhelmingly and definitively support the role of MAP in at least
      30%-50% of CD patients. It is very possible that lack of detection of MAP from
      some CD patients may be due to the absence of MAP role in these patients. The
      latter statement is conditional on utilization of methodology appropriate for
      detection of human MAP strains. Ultimately, stratification of CD and inflammatory
      bowel disease patients for the presence or absence of MAP is necessary for
      appropriate and effective treatment which may lead to a cure.

TI  - Variable access to quality nutrition information regarding inflammatory bowel
      disease: a survey of patients and health professionals and objective examination 
      of written information.
PG  - 2501-12
LID - 10.1111/hex.12219 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) report a range of
      nutritional and dietary problems and high-quality written information should be
      available on these. There is little research investigating the availability and
      quality of such information for patients with IBD. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed
      the type and quality of written information on nutrition and diet available to
      patients with IBD and the opinions of patients and health professionals. SETTING 
      AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-two patients with IBD were recruited from a large
      gastroenterology outpatient centre in England. One hundred dietitians from across
      the United Kingdom were also recruited. METHODS: Face-to-face surveys were
      conducted with patients with IBD. Questions regarding the use, format and
      usefulness of dietary information received were probed. Dietitians were surveyed 
      regarding written dietary information used in clinical practice. Samples of
      IBD-specific dietary information used across the UK were objectively assessed
      using two validated tools. MAIN RESULTS: The majority of patients rated written
      information as 'good' or 'very good', with the most useful information relating
      to 'general diet and IBD'. Forty-nine (49%) dietitians reported gaps in written
      information available for patients with IBD. Fifty-three different samples of
      IBD-specific information sheets were returned, with widely variable objective
      quality ratings. Commercially produced written information scored greater than
      locally produced information (BMA tool, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patient access to
      high-quality, written, IBD-specific dietary information is variable. IBD-specific
      written nutrition information needs to be developed in accordance with validated 
      tools to empower patients, encourage self-management and overcome nutritional
      implications of IBD.

TI  - Does seasonal level of serum 25-OH vitamin D correlate with the activity of
      Crohn's disease?
PG  - 51-9
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Vitamin D has immune modulating effects and normal to high
      levels might be correlated with less severe Crohn's disease (CD). We aimed to
      review seasonal vitamin D levels in CD patients in correlation with disease
      activity. METHODS: CD patients were identified from an inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) database and given two questionnaires enquiring about vitamin D
      supplementation, sun exposure, sunblock application and symptoms to complete the 
      CDAI. Participants were examined and serum 25-OH vitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and
      haematocrit were determined in winter (06/2011-09/2011) and summer
      (12/2011-03/2012). Patients taking vitamin D supplements or with extensive small 
      bowel resection were excluded. RESULTS: 32 patients (19 women, mean age 39 plus
      or minus 16 years, range 18-73 years), from Dunedin, New Zealand (45 degrees 52' 
      S, 170 degrees 30' E) consented to participate in the study. Of these, three took
      vitamin D supplements and were excluded. In winter 76% of the participants had
      serum 25(OH)D levels classified as deficient (<50 nmol/L) and all of them had
      insufficient 25(OH)D levels (<75 nmol/L). In summer, serum 25(OH)D levels were
      deficient only in 10% but insufficient in 55% of the participants. Mean serum
      25(OH)D level was 35.9 nmol/L (norm 50-150nmol/L) in winter (range 5-67, SD 17.5)
      and 69.6 nmol/L in summer (range 13-119, SD 19.0) (p<0.0005). There was no
      significant difference in the seasonal levels of serum 25(OH)D between male and
      female participants (p=0.601). Mean CDAI score was 103.9 in winter (range
      -10-262, SD 76.9) and 90.2 in summer (range -13-331, SD 84.0) (p=0.365). A
      mixed-effects regression analysis showed no statistically significant correlation
      between seasonal levels of serum 25(OH)D and CDAI (p=0.612) among our study
      participants. CONCLUSION: Suboptimal levels of serum 25(OH)D were found in the
      majority of our study participants particularly in winter and they would benefit 
      from supplementation. Our study showed no statistically significant correlation
      between seasonal serum 25(OH)D levels and CD activity. Given the limitations of
      the study, the role of 25(OH)D as a predictor of disease activity could not be
      clearly concluded.

TI  - Maintenance of optimal vitamin D status in children and adolescents with
      inflammatory bowel disease: a randomized clinical trial comparing two regimens.
PG  - 3408-17
LID - 10.1210/jc.2013-4218 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Vitamin D promotes bone health and regulates the immune system, both
      important actions for pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
      The supplementation dose that would maintain optimal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D
      concentration (25OHD >/= 32 ng/mL) is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the
      study was to compare two supplementation regimens' efficacy and safety in
      maintaining optimal 25OHD in children with IBD. DESIGN: This was a randomized,
      not blinded, controlled trial. SETTING: The trial was conducted in the Boston
      Children's Hospital Clinical and Translational Study Unit. PARTICIPANTS:
      Sixty-three patients, aged 8-18 years with IBD and baseline 25OHD greater than 20
      ng/mL were enrolled; 48 completed the study, and one withdrew for adverse events.
      INTERVENTION: Arm A received 400 IU of oral vitamin D2 daily (n = 32). Arm B
      received 1000 IU daily in the summer/fall and 2000 IU in the winter/spring (n =
      31). MAIN OUTCOME: The main outcome was the probability of maintaining 25OHD of
      32 ng/mL or greater in all trimonthly visits for 12 months. RESULTS: Three
      participants in arm A (9.4%) and three in arm B (9.7%) achieved the primary
      outcome (P = .97). The incidence of adverse events, all minor, did not differ.
      More participants in arm A developed C-reactive protein level of 1 mg/dL or
      greater (31% vs 10%, P = .04) and IL-6 greater than 3 pg/mL (54% vs 27%, P =
      .05). CONCLUSIONS: Daily oral vitamin D2 doses up to 2000 IU were inadequate to
      maintain optimal 25OHD but were well tolerated. The finding of lower incidence of
      elevated inflammatory markers and cytokines among participants receiving higher
      vitamin D2 doses merits further study.

TI  - Pancreatitis-associated protein has no additional value as a marker of disease
      activity in a real-life cohort of IBD patients.
PG  - 902-9
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0000000000000141 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Monitoring of mucosal inflammation in inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) is of major importance. New noninvasive markers for intestinal
      inflammation are needed. Previous studies have reported that
      pancreatitis-associated protein (PAP) correlates with clinical activity in IBD
      subgroups. Our aim was to investigate the correlation of serum and fecal PAP with
      clinical and biochemical parameters of disease activity in a real-life IBD
      cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred and five consecutive IBD patients were 
      enrolled. Clinical disease activity was scored by the Harvey-Bradshaw Index or
      the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index; also, C-reactive protein (CRP),
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and fecal calprotectin were determined. As
      surrogate for endoscopy, a combination score of clinical indices with CRP or
      calprotectin was used to define active disease. Fecal and serum PAP were measured
      by ELISA. RESULTS: The median serum and fecal PAP did not differ in Crohn's
      disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) patients with active compared with
      inactive disease according to clinical activity indices. Defining active disease 
      by a combination score of Harvey-Bradshaw Index of more than 4 and CRP of more
      than 5 mg/l or calprotectin more than 250 microg/g, serum PAP (P=0.01), but not
      fecal PAP (P=0.32), was significantly higher in active than inactive CD patients.
      Area under the curve of the corresponding receiver operating curve (ROC) was
      0.64. No differences were found in serum or fecal PAP levels using the
      combination score for active disease in UC. CONCLUSION: Serum but not fecal PAP
      was higher in active compared with nonactive CD and may reflect mucosal
      inflammation in CD, but not in UC. However, the accuracy of serum PAP for the
      diagnosis of active disease was poor, and therefore, serum PAP does not seem to
      have additional value compared with the current noninvasive markers.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) with its two major forms Crohn's disease (CD)
      and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic relapsing disorders leading to
      inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Although the precise aetiology of IBD
      remains unclear, several factors are believed to contribute to disease
      pathogenesis. Among these, the role of the intestinal microbiota has become more 
      and more appreciated. Evidence from experimental and clinical studies strongly
      suggests that chronic intestinal inflammation results from a dysregulated immune 
      response towards components of the microbiota in genetically susceptible hosts.
      The growing perception of the microbiota as a major driver of disease
      pathogenesis raises the question, if the intestinal microbiota can be used as a
      therapeutic target in CD. Based on what we know about host microbiota
      interactions in health and disease, the objective of this review is to address
      the question if the microbiota holds the key to the future therapy in CD.

TI  - Diet-induced hypoxia responsive element demethylation increases CEACAM6
      expression, favouring Crohn's disease-associated Escherichia coli colonisation.
PG  - 428-37
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2014-306944 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) are abnormally predominant
      on Crohn's disease (CD) ileal mucosa. AIEC strains adhere to enterocytes via
      interaction between type 1 pili and CEACAM6 receptors abnormally expressed on CD 
      ileal mucosa, leading to gut inflammation. We analysed whether epigenetic
      mechanisms are involved in the upregulation of CEACAM6 expression in intestinal
      epithelial cells (IECs). DESIGN: Methylation of CEACAM6 promoter was analysed
      using bisulfite sequencing and site-specific methylation by SnapShot. pCpGfree
      reporter system was used to analyse CEACAM6 promoter activity. Transgenic mice
      expressing human CEACAM6 fed either standard food or a low-methyl diet (LMD) were
      orally challenged with 10(9) AIEC LF82. After 3 days, gut-associated AIEC and
      proinflammatory cytokines were quantified. RESULTS: Analysis of CEACAM6 gene
      promoter revealed potentially methylated dinucleotide CpGs within
      HIF-1-responsive elements (HREs). Methylation levels of CpG within CEACAM6
      promoter were inversely correlated with CEACAM6 expression in IEC expressing
      various levels of CEACAM6. We show the critical role of HRE methylation and
      transcription factor HIF-1 in the regulation of CEACAM6 gene in IEC. This was
      confirmed in transgenic mice expressing human CEACAM6 fed a LMD. LMD-dependent
      HRE demethylation led to abnormal gut expression of CEACAM6, favouring AIEC
      colonisation and subsequent inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: HRE hypomethylation in
      CEACAM6 promoter correlates with high expression in IEC. Our findings suggest
      that abnormal DNA methylation leading to CEACAM6 increased expression and
      AIEC-mediated gut inflammation can be related to changes in nutritional habits,
      such as low intake in methyl donor molecules, leading to abnormal epigenetic
      marks in mouse model mimicking CD susceptibility.

      Crohn disease.
PG  - 516-21

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to prospectively evaluate clinical and
      mucosal responses to the specific carbohydrate diet (SCD) in children with Crohn 
      disease (CD). METHODS: Eligible patients with active CD (Pediatric Crohn's
      Disease Activity Index [PCDAI] >/= 15) underwent a patency capsule and, if passed
      intact, capsule endoscopy (CE) was performed. Patients taking SCD were monitored 
      for 52 weeks while maintaining all prescribed medications. Demographic, dietary, 
      and clinical information, PCDAI, Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI), and Lewis score
      (LS) were collected at 0, 12, and 52 weeks. CEs were evaluated by an experienced 
      reader blinded to patient clinical information and timing. RESULTS: Sixteen
      patients were screened; 10 enrolled; and 9 completed the initial 12-week
      trial-receiving 85% of estimated caloric needs before, and 101% on the SCD. HB
      significantly decreased from 3.3 +/- 2.0 to 0.6 +/- 1.3 (P = 0.007) as did PCDAI 
      (21.1 +/- 5.9 to 7.8 +/- 7.1, P = 0.011). LS declined significantly from 2153 +/-
      732 to 960 +/- 433 (P = 0.012). Seven patients continued the SCD up to 52 weeks; 
      HB (0.1 +/- 0.4) and PCDAI (5.4 +/- 5.5) remained improved (P = 0.016 and 0.027
      compared to baseline), with mean LS at 1046 +/- 372 and 2 patients showed
      sustained mucosal healing. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical and mucosal improvements were
      seen in children with CD, who used SCD for 12 and 52 weeks. In addition, CE can
      monitor mucosal improvement in treatment trials for pediatric CD. Further studies
      are critically needed to understand the mechanisms underlying SCD's effectiveness
      in children with CD.

AB  - Crohn disease is a chronic disorder characterized by episodes of epithelial
      inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract for which there is no cure. The
      prevalence of Crohn disease increased in civilized nations during the time period
      in which food sources were industrialized in those nations. A characteristic of
      industrialized diets is the conspicuous absence of cereal fiber. The purpose of
      this 2-group, randomized, controlled study was to investigate the effects of
      fiber-related dietary instructions specifying wheat bran consumption on
      health-related quality of life and gastrointestinal function in individuals
      diagnosed with Crohn disease, as measured by the Inflammatory Bowel Disease
      Questionnaire and the partial Harvey Bradshaw Index, respectively. Results
      demonstrated that consuming a wheat bran-inclusive diet was feasible and caused
      no adverse effects, and participants consuming whole wheat bran in the diet
      reported improved health-related quality of life (p = .028) and gastrointestinal 
      function (p = .008) compared to the attention control group. The results of a
      secondary aim, to investigate differences in measures of systemic inflammation,
      found no group differences in C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation
      rates. This study suggests that diet modification may be a welcomed complementary
      therapy for individuals suffering gastrointestinal disruption associated with
      Crohn disease.

LID - 10.1007/s11657-014-0177-0 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Osteomalacia is a metabolic bone disorder characterized by impaired
      mineralization of the bone matrix. Vitamin D deficiency due to malabsorption
      syndromes may cause osteomalacia. This is a case of a patient with a 6-year
      history of seronegative spondyloarthropathy associated with Crohn's disease who
      was admitted to our outpatient clinic with symptoms of osteomalacia.
      INTRODUCTION: Osteomalacia is a metabolic bone disease characterized by an
      impaired mineralization of the bone matrix, frequently caused by disorders in
      vitamin D or phosphate metabolism. Vitamin D deficiency due to malabsorption
      syndromes (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, and
      jejuno-ileal bypass for obesity) may cause osteomalacia. CASE REPORT: A
      43-year-old male presented with fatigue, low back pain, and morning stiffness. He
      had a 6-year history of seronegative spondyloarthropathy associated with Crohn's 
      disease. Laboratory findings revealed low serum calcium, low 25-hydroxy vitamin
      D3, normal phosphorus, elevated parathyroid hormone, and alkaline phosphatase
      levels. Radiographs revealed grade IV sacroiliitis and Looser zones. He was
      diagnosed with osteomalacia due to the malabsorption of vitamin D. His symptoms
      and signs were relieved with supplements of vitamin D and calcium. CONCLUSIONS:
      Osteomalacia should be considered in differential diagnosis when assessing low
      back pain in the patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Vitamin D
      deficiency should be treated with vitamin D supplementation in patients with
      Crohn's disease to prevent osteomalacia.

TI  - Intraepithelial lymphocyte eotaxin-2 expression and perineural mast cell
      degranulation differentiate allergic/eosinophilic colitis from classic IBD.
PG  - 300-7
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000432 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Allergic colitis shows overlap with classic inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). Clinically, allergic colitis is associated with dysmotility and
      abdominal pain, and mucosal eosinophilia is characteristic. We thus aimed to
      characterise mucosal changes in children with allergic colitis compared with
      normal tissue and classic IBD, focusing on potential interaction between
      eosinophils and mast cells with enteric neurones. METHODS: A total of 15 children
      with allergic colitis, 10 with Crohn disease (CD), 10 with ulcerative colitis
      (UC), and 10 histologically normal controls were studied. Mucosal biopsies were
      stained for CD3 T cells, Ki-67, eotaxin-1, and eotaxin-2. Eotaxin-2, IgE, and
      tryptase were localised compared with mucosal nerves, using neuronal markers
      neurofilament protein, neuron-specific enolase, and nerve growth factor receptor.
      RESULTS: Overall inflammation was greater in patients with CD and UC than in
      patients with allergic colitis. CD3 T-cell density was increased in patients with
      allergic colitis, similar to that in patients with CD but lower than in patients 
      with UC, whereas eosinophil density was higher than in all other groups.
      Eotaxin-1 and -2 were localised to basolateral crypt epithelium in all specimens,
      with eotaxin-1+ lamina propria cells found in all of the colitis groups.
      Eotaxin-2+ intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) density was significantly higher in
      allergic colitis specimens than in all other groups. Mast cell degranulation was 
      strikingly increased in patients with allergic colitis (12/15) compared with that
      in patients with UC (1/10) and CD (0/1). Tryptase and IgE colocalised on enteric 
      neurons in patients with allergic colitis but rarely in patients with IBD.
      CONCLUSIONS: Eotaxin-2+ IELs may contribute to the periepithelial eosinophil
      accumulation characteristic of allergic colitis. The colocalisation of IgE and
      tryptase with mucosal enteric nerves is likely to promote the dysmotility and
      visceral hyperalgesia classically seen in allergic gastrointestinal inflammation.

TI  - Faecal metabolite profiling identifies medium-chain fatty acids as discriminating
      compounds in IBD.
PG  - 447-58
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2013-306423 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteria play a role in the onset and perpetuation of intestinal
      inflammation in IBD. Compositional alterations may also change the metabolic
      capacities of the gut bacteria. OBJECTIVE: To examine the metabolic activity of
      the microbiota of patients with Crohn's disease (CD), UC or pouchitis compared
      with healthy controls (HC) and determine whether eventual differences might be
      related to the pathogenesis of the disease. METHODS: Faecal samples were obtained
      from 40 HC, 83 patients with CD, 68 with UC and 13 with pouchitis. Disease
      activity was assessed in CD using the Harvey-Bradshaw Index, in UC using the UC
      Disease Activity Index and in pouchitis using the Pouchitis Disease Activity
      Index. Metabolite profiles were analysed using gas chromatography-mass
      spectrometry. RESULTS: The number of metabolites identified in HC (54) was
      significantly higher than in patients with CD (44, p<0.001), UC (47, p=0.042) and
      pouchitis (43, p=0.036). Multivariate discriminant analysis predicted HC, CD, UC 
      and pouchitis group membership with high sensitivity and specificity. The levels 
      of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs: pentanoate, hexanoate, heptanoate, octanoate 
      and nonanoate), and of some protein fermentation metabolites, were significantly 
      decreased in patients with CD, UC and pouchitis. Hexanoate levels were inversely 
      correlated to disease activity in CD (correlation coefficient=-0.157, p=0.046),
      whereas a significant positive correlation was found between styrene levels and
      disease activity in UC (correlation coefficient=0.338, p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS:
      Faecal metabolic profiling in patients with IBD relative to healthy controls
      identified MCFAs as important metabolic biomarkers of disease-related changes.

PG  - 347-55
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000414 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to report on the measurement
      properties of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Gastrointestinal
      Symptoms Module for patients with functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders
      (FGIDs) and organic GI diseases, hereafter referred to as "GI disorders," for
      patient self-report ages between 5 and 18 and parent proxy-report for ages
      between 2 and 18 years. METHODS: The 74-item PedsQL GI Module and 23-item PedsQL 
      Generic Core Scales were completed in a 9-site study by 584 patients and 682
      parents. Patients had physician-diagnosed GI disorders (such as chronic
      constipation, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, functional
      dyspepsia, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease).
      RESULTS: Fourteen unidimensional scales were derived measuring stomach pain,
      stomach discomfort when eating, food and drink limits, trouble swallowing,
      heartburn and reflux, nausea and vomiting, gas and bloating, constipation, blood,
      diarrhea, worry, medicines, and communication. The PedsQL GI Module Scales
      evidenced excellent feasibility, excellent reliability for the Total Scale Scores
      (patient self-report alpha = 0.97, parent proxy-report alpha = 0.97), and
      good-to-excellent reliability for the 14 individual scales (patient self-report
      alpha = 0.67-0.94, parent proxy-report alpha = 0.77-0.95). Intercorrelations with
      the Generic Core Scales supported construct validity. Individual Symptoms Scales 
      known-groups validity across 7 GI disorders was generally supported. Factor
      analysis supported the unidimensionality of the individual scales. CONCLUSIONS:
      The PedsQL GI Module Scales demonstrated acceptable-to-excellent measurement
      properties and may be used as common metrics to compare GI-specific symptoms in
      clinical research and practice both within and across patient groups for FGIDs
      and organic GI diseases.

      disease.

LID - 10.1038/mi.2014.30 [doi]
AB  - Accumulating evidence implicates defective innate immunity in the pathogenesis of
      Crohn's disease (CD). Ineffectual NOD2 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain
      2) is the most common susceptibility gene contributing to CD. Vitamin D (vD), a
      potent modulator of innate and adaptive immunity, induces NOD2 gene expression
      and its downstream function. We hypothesized that the hormonal form of vD (1,25D)
      could beneficially modulate innate immune function in CD. Using peripheral
      mononuclear cells and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs) from CD, it was
      found that 1,25D decreased Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced cytokine production
      and enhanced cytokine levels induced by muramyl dipeptide (MDP), the NOD2 ligand.
      1,25D increased the synergistic effect provided by NOD2 and TLR co-activation on 
      interleukin (IL)-10, IL-23, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Whereas 
      1,25D inhibits Mo-DC TLR-induced cytokines, co-stimulation of NOD2 results in
      increased IL-10 and IL-23. IL-12p70 was completely abrogated by 1,25D. 1,25D
      similarly modulated cytokine production by immune cells in ulcerative colitis
      patients and healthy controls. Mo-DCs from CD patients heterozygous for NOD2
      mutations had a response similar to those from patients without NOD2 mutations.
      Immune cells from patients homozygous for the 1007 fs mutation were unresponsive 
      to MDP and 1,25D. Our in vitro data support 1,25D as a potential modulator of
      immunity. However, these results cannot be extrapolated to CD patients without
      further controlled studies.

AB  - Signs of malnutrition are common clinical features in Crohn's disease; and bowel 
      resection, commonly needed in these cases, can aggravate malnutrition. These
      patients are at risk of developing vitamin A deficiency, which can lead to night 
      blindness. We present a 60-year-old male, with history of Crohn's disease and
      multiple resections for strictures and fistulas leading to short bowel syndrome, 
      with progressive bilateral loss of night vision (nyctalopia). Serum vitamin A
      level was markedly depleted (11 microg/dL, reference 20-120 microg/dL), and
      full-field electroretinogram testing demonstrated extinguished scotopic (rod
      function) responses and decreased amplitudes of photopic responses on 30 Hz
      flicker (cone function). He was started on vitamin A supplementation (initially
      intramuscular). His vitamin A level was back to normal (78 microg/dL), and night 
      vision problems subjectively improved. Patients with Crohn's disease should be
      inquired about night vision problems. The presence of nyctalopia should prompt
      vitamin A level measurement and ophthalmology referral for further evaluation.

      FDA warnings.
PG  - 570-1
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2014.34 [doi]
AB  - Based on the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS),
      the FDA and Hoffman La Roche issued warnings of a possible causal association
      between isotretinoin and inflammatory bowel disease. While scientists studied the
      association, trial lawyers used the courts to award large sums of money to
      plaintiffs despite the absence of clear scientific evidence of a causal effect.
      In this Issue of the Journal, a well-designed, large pharmaco-epidemiologic study
      shows no association. The story of isotretinoin highlights the problems that
      occur when the FAERS is used in litigation prior to further study and scientific 
      analysis.

TI  - Selenium and selenoproteins in inflammatory bowel diseases and experimental
      colitis.
PG  - 1110-9
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000020 [doi]
AB  - Inadequate dietary intake of the essential trace element selenium (Se) is thought
      to be a risk factor for several chronic diseases associated with oxidative stress
      and inflammation. Biological actions of Se occur through low-molecular weight
      metabolites and through selenoproteins. Several key selenoproteins including
      glutathione peroxidases; selenoproteins M, P, and S; and selenium-binding protein
      1 have been detected in the intestine. Interestingly, Se and antioxidant
      selenoproteins are known to modulate differentiation and function of immune cells
      and contribute to avoid excessive immune responses. This review discusses the
      role of Se and intestinal selenoproteins in inflammatory bowel diseases, based on
      data from human, animal, and in vitro studies. In humans, Se deficiency is
      commonly observed in patients with Crohn's disease. In animal models of
      experimental colitis, the Se status was negatively correlated with the severity
      of the disease. While the cause-effect relationship of these observations remains
      to be clarified, the beneficial outcome of dietary Se supplementation and an
      optimization of selenoprotein biosynthesis in murine inflammatory bowel disease
      models have led to investigations of targets and actions of Se in the
      gastrointestinal tract. The Se status affects gene expression, signaling
      pathways, and cellular functions in the small and large intestine as well as the 
      gut microbiome composition. This data, particularly from animal experiments, hold
      promise that adequate dietary Se supply may counteract chronic intestinal
      inflammation in humans.

      activity and treatment.
PG  - 856-60
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000016 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency is common in patients with Crohn's disease (CD),
      although whether this impairs immune responsiveness, and is related to disease
      activity per se, remains unclear. We sought to investigate vitamin D pathways in 
      patients with CD according to measures of inflammation and immune response.
      METHODS: Prospectively collected samples of a well-characterized cohort of
      patients with CD were used to measure serum 25(OH)-vitamin D levels by
      enzyme-linked immunoassay. Related gene expression was determined by polymerase
      chain reaction in T cells. The effect of vitamin D on the proliferation of
      isolated CD4 cells was determined. RESULTS: Patients with active CD had lower
      serum vitamin D levels than those in clinical remission; this measurement was
      independent of season or reported use of vitamin D supplements. Harvey-Bradshaw
      Index scores, but not C-reactive protein, correlated with serum vitamin D levels.
      Gene expression of the vitamin D receptor was higher in peripheral blood T cells 
      from patients with active disease than in those in remission. The proportion of
      CD25hi CD4 cells from patients with CD increased in the presence of vitamin D.
      After treatment with infliximab, significant increases in serum vitamin D levels 
      were noted in patients. CONCLUSIONS: Low vitamin D levels are associated with
      disease activity in CD and increase after infliximab treatment.

TI  - Association between high dietary intake of the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid
      docosahexaenoic acid and reduced risk of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 834-42
LID - 10.1111/apt.12670 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are plausible mechanisms for how dietary docosahexaenoic acid
      (DHA), an n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, could prevent Crohn's disease (CD).
      AIM: To conduct a prospective study to investigate the association between
      increased intake of DHA and risk of CD. METHODS: Overall, 229 702 participants
      were recruited from nine European centres between 1991 and 1998. At recruitment, 
      dietary intakes of DHA and fatty acids were measured using validated food
      frequency questionnaires. The cohort was monitored through to June 2004 to
      identify participants who developed incident CD. In a nested case-control
      analysis, each case was matched with four controls; odds ratios (ORs) were
      calculated for quintiles of DHA intake, adjusted for total energy intake,
      smoking, other dietary fatty acids, dietary vitamin D and body mass index.
      RESULTS: Seventy-three participants developed incident CD. All higher quintiles
      of DHA intake were inversely associated with development of CD; the highest
      quintile had the greatest effect size (OR = 0.07; 95% CI = 0.02-0.81). The OR
      trend across quintiles of DHA was 0.54 (95% CI = 0.30-0.99, Ptrend = 0.04).
      Including BMI in the multivariate analysis, due to its correlation with dietary
      fat showed similar associations. There were no associations with the other
      dietary fatty acids studied. CONCLUSION: There were inverse associations, with a 
      biological gradient between increasing dietary docosahexaenoic acid intakes and
      incident Crohn's disease. Further studies in other populations should measure
      docosahexaenoic acid to determine if the association is consistent and the
      hypothesis tested in randomised controlled trials of purely docosahexaenoic acid 
      supplementation.

TI  - Development of a self-efficacy scale for adolescents and young adults with
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 29-32
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000357 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) self-management fits well 
      within a social-cognitive framework. At the heart of social-cognitive theory is
      self-efficacy, a set of beliefs about one's ability to perform certain tasks.
      Self-efficacy is a strong predictor of health outcomes in chronic diseases and
      could serve as an intermediary outcome measure of self-management for pediatric
      IBD. The aim of this preliminary study was to develop items for the design of a
      self-efficacy scale specifically for adolescents and young adults with IBD.
      METHODS: Survey development is an iterative process. As defined by the US Food
      and Drug Administration guidelines for developing a patient-reported outcome
      measurement, the first step of this process is to obtain patient input. Using
      qualitative research methods, adolescents and young adults were recruited from an
      outpatient pediatric gastroenterology clinic to participate in a semistructured
      interview. Transcriptions of the recorded interviews were reviewed for themes
      related to self-efficacy around disease management. A consensus panel of
      gastroenterologists and health psychologists reviewed the initially constructed
      items. Those specific items were then reviewed and adjusted by a panel of
      participants for content and understandability using cognitive interview methods.
      The resulting 13-item scale is presented here. RESULTS: Nineteen patients and 5
      parents participated in the study. The study sample was 42% girls, 79% whites,
      74% had Crohn disease, and 79% had not required surgery. Median age was 15 years 
      (range 10-22 years). Theme analysis and expert review yielded 13 items across 4
      theoretical domains: managing medical care, managing daily life with IBD,
      managing emotions, and managing the future with IBD. CONCLUSIONS: A 13-item
      disease-specific scale has been developed based on patient input to assess
      self-efficacy around self-management in adolescents with IBD. Efforts to validate
      this newly designed scale are presently under way.

TI  - Genome-wide association study of metabolic traits reveals novel
      gene-metabolite-disease links.
PG  - e1004132
LID - 10.1371/journal.pgen.1004132 [doi]
AB  - Metabolic traits are molecular phenotypes that can drive clinical phenotypes and 
      may predict disease progression. Here, we report results from a metabolome- and
      genome-wide association study on (1)H-NMR urine metabolic profiles. The study was
      conducted within an untargeted approach, employing a novel method for compound
      identification. From our discovery cohort of 835 Caucasian individuals who
      participated in the CoLaus study, we identified 139 suggestively significant
      (P<5x10(-8)) and independent associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms
      (SNP) and metabolome features. Fifty-six of these associations replicated in the 
      TasteSensomics cohort, comprising 601 individuals from Sao Paulo of vastly
      diverse ethnic background. They correspond to eleven gene-metabolite
      associations, six of which had been previously identified in the urine metabolome
      and three in the serum metabolome. Our key novel findings are the associations of
      two SNPs with NMR spectral signatures pointing to fucose (rs492602, P =
      6.9x10(-44)) and lysine (rs8101881, P = 1.2x10(-33)), respectively. Fine-mapping 
      of the first locus pinpointed the FUT2 gene, which encodes a fucosyltransferase
      enzyme and has previously been associated with Crohn's disease. This implicates
      fucose as a potential prognostic disease marker, for which there is already
      published evidence from a mouse model. The second SNP lies within the SLC7A9
      gene, rare mutations of which have been linked to severe kidney damage. The
      replication of previous associations and our new discoveries demonstrate the
      potential of untargeted metabolomics GWAS to robustly identify molecular disease 
      markers.

TI  - Colonic expression of the peptide transporter PEPT1 is downregulated during
      intestinal inflammation and is not required for NOD2-dependent immune activation.
PG  - 671-84
LID - 10.1097/01.MIB.0000443336.71488.08 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: PEPT1 was proposed to be expressed only in inflamed colonic tissues
      in which it could contribute to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) development by
      transporting bacterial peptides, such as muramyl dipeptide (MDP), that activate
      intracellular pattern recognition receptors, such as the nucleotide-binding and
      oligomerization domain 2. To better define the pathological relevance of this
      transporter, we analyzed PEPT1 expression during intestinal inflammation and
      studied the susceptibility of Pept1-deficient (Pept1) mice to experimental
      colitis. METHODS: Wild-type and Pept1 mice were treated with dextran sulfate
      sodium and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid to induce colitis, and MDP-induced
      cytokine expression was studied in colonic tissue cultures. PEPT1 expression was 
      characterized in mouse models of Crohn's disease-like ileitis (Tnf) or colitis
      (Il-10, Il-10XTlr2) and endoscopic tissue samples from descending colon of
      patients with IBD (n = 11) and controls (n = 17). Moreover, the prevalence of the
      PEPT1 single-nucleotide polymorphism rs2297322 was tested in German patients with
      IBD (n = 458) and controls (n = 452). RESULTS: PEPT1 expression was consistently 
      reduced under condition of acute or chronic experimental inflammation. Wild-type 
      and Pept1 mice revealed comparable susceptibility to dextran sulfate
      sodium-induced and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis, and
      MDP-induced cytokine expression was PEPT1-independent. PEPT1 expression levels
      were also decreased in descending colon of patients with IBD during acute
      inflammation, but the rs2297322 single-nucleotide polymorphism was not associated
      with IBD susceptibility in the German cohort. CONCLUSIONS: PEPT1 expression is
      reduced during intestinal inflammation and PEPT1 is neither required for
      MDP-induced immune response nor is the PEPT1 rs2297322 single-nucleotide
      polymorphism associated with IBD susceptibility in our German cohort. These data 
      strongly argue against a primary role of PEPT1 in the initiation or progression
      of IBD.

AB  - The evolving understanding of the role of the microbiome and environmental
      factors in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease makes diet an
      interesting and potentially powerful tool in the treatment of disease. However,
      at this time, evidence is limited but anecdotal reports of success abound. There 
      is a bewildering array of new diets being tried by patients in an attempt to
      control diseases. This review attempts to summarize the most common diets for the
      treating physician.

AB  - Studies of the roles of microbial communities in the development of inflammatory 
      bowel disease (IBD) have reached an important milestone. A decade of genome-wide 
      association studies and other genetic analyses have linked IBD with loci that
      implicate an aberrant immune response to the intestinal microbiota. More
      recently, profiling studies of the intestinal microbiome have associated the
      pathogenesis of IBD with characteristic shifts in the composition of the
      intestinal microbiota, reinforcing the view that IBD results from altered
      interactions between intestinal microbes and the mucosal immune system. Enhanced 
      technologies can increase our understanding of the interactions between the host 
      and its resident microbiota and their respective roles in IBD from both a
      large-scale pathway view and at the metabolic level. We review important
      microbiome studies of patients with IBD and describe what we have learned about
      the mechanisms of intestinal microbiota dysfunction. We describe the recent
      progress in microbiome research from exploratory 16S-based studies, reporting
      associations of specific organisms with a disease, to more recent studies that
      have taken a more nuanced view, addressing the function of the microbiota by
      metagenomic and metabolomic methods. Finally, we propose study designs and
      methodologies for future investigations of the microbiome in patients with
      inflammatory gut and autoimmune diseases in general.

TI  - A Crohn's disease variant in Atg16l1 enhances its degradation by caspase 3.
PG  - 456-62
LID - 10.1038/nature13044 [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease is a debilitating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that can
      involve the entire digestive tract. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
      encoding a missense variant in the autophagy gene ATG16L1 (rs2241880, Thr300Ala) 
      is strongly associated with the incidence of Crohn's disease. Numerous studies
      have demonstrated the effect of ATG16L1 deletion or deficiency; however, the
      molecular consequences of the Thr300Ala (T300A) variant remains unknown. Here we 
      show that amino acids 296-299 constitute a caspase cleavage motif in ATG16L1 and 
      that the T300A variant (T316A in mice) significantly increases ATG16L1
      sensitization to caspase-3-mediated processing. We observed that death-receptor
      activation or starvation-induced metabolic stress in human and murine macrophages
      increased degradation of the T300A or T316A variants of ATG16L1, respectively,
      resulting in diminished autophagy. Knock-in mice harbouring the T316A variant
      showed defective clearance of the ileal pathogen Yersinia enterocolitica and an
      elevated inflammatory cytokine response. In turn, deletion of the
      caspase-3-encoding gene, Casp3, or elimination of the caspase cleavage site by
      site-directed mutagenesis rescued starvation-induced autophagy and pathogen
      clearance, respectively. These findings demonstrate that caspase 3 activation in 
      the presence of a common risk allele leads to accelerated degradation of ATG16L1,
      placing cellular stress, apoptotic stimuli and impaired autophagy in a unified
      pathway that predisposes to Crohn's disease.

TI  - Use of topical metronidazole in the treatment of anorectal Crohn's disease.
PG  - 380-3
AB  - Anorectal Crohn's disease is one of the most problematic and debilitating forms
      of Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that 
      usually affects the intestines but may occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal
      tract and is frequently refractory to medication, which may ultimately result in 
      proctocolectomy and ileostomy surgeries. It is reported in 3% to 5% of Crohn's
      patients and is found in conjunction with colorectal or enteric disease in
      one-third to one-half of Crohn's disease patients. This article discusses the use
      of metronidazole 10% ointment for the treatment of anorectal Crohn's disease.
      Since metronidazole is not U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved for
      treating anorectal Crohn's disease, and there is no commercially available
      metronidazole 10% ointment, compounding pharmacists can play a role in providing 
      this dosage form. This article discusses some of the common symptoms of Crohn's
      disease and the use of topical metronidazole to treat the disease.

AB  - Gut microbiota is more and more important since metagenomic research have brought
      new knowledge on this topic especially for human health. Firstly, gut microbiota 
      is a key element for our organism he lives in symbiosis with. Secondly, it
      interacts favorably with many physiological functions of our organism. Thirdly,
      at the opposite, it can be an active participant in intestinal pathologies linked
      to a dysbiosis mainly in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn disease
      or ulcerative colitis but also in obesity, metabolic syndrome, and more prudently
      in autism and behavioral disorders. In order to keep a good health, it is
      essential to protect our gut microbiota as soon as our young age and maintain it 
      healthy. Face to a more and more important number of publications for treating
      certain digestive diseases with fecal microbial transplantation, it needs to be
      very careful and recommend further studies in order to assess risks and define
      standardized protocols. Gut microbiota metabolic capacities towards xenobiotics
      need to be developed, and we must take an interest in the modifications they
      induce on medicinal molecules. On the other hand, it is essential to study the
      potent effects of pesticides and other pollutants on microbiota functions.

TI  - Detailed assessment of nutritional status and eating patterns in children with
      gastrointestinal diseases attending an outpatients clinic and contemporary
      healthy controls.
PG  - 700-6
LID - 10.1038/ejcn.2013.286 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: In the era of modern multidisciplinary clinical
      management, very little is known about the prevalence and presentation of
      malnutrition in children with gastrointestinal disorders (GastroD) particularly
      employing composite, global measures of nutritional status. SUBJECTS/METHODS:
      Anthropometry, body composition, dietary intake, eating habits and grip strength 
      were assessed with bedside methods in 168 patients from outpatient
      gastroenterology clinics (n, median (IQR) years; Crohn's disease (CD): n=53, 14.2
      (11.6:15.4); ulcerative colitis (UC): n=27, 12.2 (10.7:14.2); coeliac disease:
      n=31, 9.3 (7.5:13.6); other GastroD: n=57, 9.8 (7.2:13.8)) and compared with 62
      contemporary healthy controls (n, median (IQR): 9.8 (6.9:13.8)) and the results
      of the recent UK, National Diet and Nutritional Survey (NDNS). RESULTS: Children 
      with CD had lower BMI z-scores than controls (median (IQR): -0.3 (-0.9:0.4) vs
      0.3 (-0.6:1.4); P=0.02) but only 2% were classified as thin (BMI z-score <-2
      s.d.). The prevalence of obesity in children with UC was 19%, 6% in CD, 11% in
      children with other GastroD and 15% in controls. No difference was found in grip 
      strength measurement between groups. Except for CD children, the proportion of
      patients with suboptimal micronutrient intake was similar to that of controls and
      the cohort of children from the latest NDNS. A higher proportion of children with
      CD had suboptimal intake for riboflavin, vitamin B6 and calcium and consumed
      significantly more meat products, juices (including carbonated drinks),
      spreads/jams and crisps and savoury snacks and significantly fewer portions of
      dairy, fish, fruits and vegetables compared with healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS:
      GastroD affect children's body composition, growth, strength, dietary intake and 
      eating habits, particularly CD, but to a lesser extent than expected.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess vitamin D status of pediatric patients with Crohn's disease
      (CD) and to compare their serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (s-25OHD) with established
      cutoffs and assess whether 6 months of supplementation with 2000 IU/d, vs 400
      IU/d, would reduce the group prevalence of vitamin D below these cutoffs. STUDY
      DESIGN: Subjects 8-18 years (n = 83) with quiescent CD were randomized to either 
      400 or 2000 IU vitamin D3/d for 6 months. RESULTS: Baseline mean +/- SD s-25OHD
      was 24 +/- 8 ng/mL; 13 subjects (16%) had an s-25OHD <16 ng/mL, 27 (33%) < 20
      ng/mL, and 65 (79%) < 30 ng/mL. There was no significant difference between
      groups in achieving the cutoffs of 16 ng/mL or 20 ng/mL at 6 months; however,
      only 35% of the 400 IU group achieved the greater cutoff of 30 ng/mL compared
      with 74% in the 2000 IU group (P < .001). Baseline adjusted mean s-25OHD
      concentrations at 6 months were 9.6 ng/mL (95% CI 6.0-13.2, P < .001) greater in 
      the 2000 IU than the 400 IU group. Disease activity was not affected by
      supplement dose. Few subjects exceeded safety marker cutoffs, and this did not
      differ by dose. CONCLUSIONS: At baseline, a high proportion of patients had a
      mean s-25OHD >20 ng/mL. 2000 IU vitamin D3/d is more effective in raising s-25OHD
      concentrations to > 30 ng/mL in children with CD than 400 IU/d, but both
      treatments were equally effective at achieving 16 or 20 ng/mL.

AB  - Increased dietary ratios of omega6/omega3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have been
      implicated in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD), but epidemiologic data
      are limited. We investigated whether variants of genes that control
      polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism (CYP4F3, FADS1, and FADS2), along with the 
      dietary ratio of omega6/omega3, confers susceptibility to CD. Based on data from 
      182 children newly diagnosed with CD and 250 controls, we found that children who
      consumed a higher dietary ratio of omega6/omega3 were susceptible for CD if they 
      were also carriers of specific variants of CYP4F3 and FADS2 genes. Our findings
      implicate diet-gene interactions in the pathogenesis of CD.

TI  - Comparison of outcomes parameters for induction of remission in new onset
      pediatric Crohn's disease: evaluation of the porto IBD group "growth relapse and 
      outcomes with therapy" (GROWTH CD) study.
PG  - 278-85

AB  - BACKGROUND: Robust evaluation of induction therapies using both clinical and
      inflammatory outcomes in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) are sparse. We attempted 
      to evaluate clinical, inflammatory, and composite outcomes of induction of
      remission therapies (normal C reactive protein [CRP] remission) in a large
      pediatric prospective multicenter study. METHODS: Patients enrolled at diagnosis 
      into the growth relapse and outcomes with therapy in Crohn's disease study were
      evaluated for disease activity, CRP, and fecal calprotectin at 8, 12 and 52 weeks
      after starting treatment. The primary endpoint was week-12 steroid-free remission
      defined by pediatric Crohn's disease activity index and CRP <0.5 mg/dL. The
      protocol required tapering off corticosteroids by week 11. RESULTS: We analyzed
      222 patients (mean age, 12.9 +/- 3.2 yr) main evaluated treatment options
      included: 5-ASA (n = 29), exclusive enteral nutrition (n = 43), and
      corticosteroids (n = 114). Clinical remission at week 12 was achieved in 155
      (73%) patients; both exclusive enteral nutrition and steroids were associated
      with normal CRP remission at week 12, although in a post hoc subgroup analysis
      exclusive enteral nutrition was superior in mild-to-moderate disease for this
      outcome. Among those in steroid-free remission in week 12, normal CRP predicted
      1-year sustained remission (86% for normal CRP versus 61% for elevated CRP; P =
      0.02). Baseline severity and early immunomodulation were similar in both groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Normal CRP steroid-free remission at week 12 was impacted by type of
      induction therapy, but not by early immunomodulation. It was associated with more
      corticosteroids-free remission at week 52 and a trend for less relapses.

TI  - Oral vitamin D3 supplementation reduces monocyte-derived dendritic cell
      maturation and cytokine production in Crohn's disease patients.
PG  - 95-103
LID - 10.1007/s10787-013-0197-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low serum vitamin D levels may provoke or aggravate Crohn's disease
      (CrD). Vitamin D3 is a well-known immune modulator that affects immune functions 
      in vitro and may prevent CrD flares. Dendritic cells (DC) are key mediators of
      vitamin D3 effects. In this study, we describe changes in monocyte-derived DC
      (mo-DC) maturation marker expression and cytokine production following 26 weeks
      of oral vitamin D3 supplementation in CrD patients. METHODS: Ten CrD patients who
      had increased serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels after oral vitamin D3 and calcium
      treatment and ten seasonally matched placebo-treated patients were selected for
      this study. Mo-DC were generated before and after the 26 weeks and induced to
      mature upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Maturation marker expression
      and cytokine production were analysed. Mo-DC function was analysed in a mixed
      leucocyte reaction (MLR). RESULTS: Compared with baseline values, LPS-matured
      mo-DC exhibited reduced expression of CD80 and reduced production of the
      cytokines IL-10, IL-1beta, and IL-6 following 26 weeks of oral vitamin D3
      supplementation. Mo-DC performance in an allogeneic MLR was unchanged after
      vitamin D3 supplementation. Treatment with the placebo did not affect maturation 
      markers, cytokine production, or the MLR. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D3 treatment in
      CrD patients led to hypo-responsive LPS-stimulated mo-DC. This finding indicates 
      that vitamin D3 levels have an impact on the monocytic precursors of mo-DC in
      vivo and may explain the positive effects of vitamin D3 supplementation on CrD
      patients. Alternatively, CrD patients with high serum vitamin D3 levels may
      represent a subgroup with low disease activity.

TI  - Standard versus rapid food reintroduction after exclusive enteral nutritional
      therapy in paediatric Crohn's disease.
PG  - 276-81
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0000000000000027 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In paediatric Crohn's disease (PCD), 6-8 weeks of exclusive enteral
      nutrition (EEN) is effective in 60-80% cases. EEN is followed by gradual food
      reintroduction over variable (1-5 weeks) periods. Currently, there is no
      recommended duration or method for food reintroduction. The rationale for slow
      reintroduction is unclear and may be because of concerns about food intolerance
      or to maintain longer remission. AIMS: The aims of this study were as follows: to
      compare relapse rates following standard and rapid reintroduction of food after
      EEN in PCD and to determine the duration of maintained remission in two groups of
      PCD patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two groups with PCD were compared: group A
      received standard food reintroduction over 5 weeks and group B received rapid
      reintroduction over 3 days. Data were collected over two consecutive time
      periods: group A (2005-2009) and group B (2009-2011). Only patients with a new
      diagnosis of PCD were included. Those with strictures and those on steroids or
      biologicals during EEN were excluded. The minimum duration of follow-up was 1
      year. RESULTS: Group A included 20 patients and group B included 19 patients. In 
      these groups, EEN led to clinical remission in 80% of the patients in group A and
      in 76% of the patients in group B. At 6 months, one-third of the patients from
      each group had developed relapse and a year after EEN, 50% of the patients in
      group A and 47% of the patients in group B developed relapse. Time to first
      relapse was 188 days (group A) and 136 days (group B). None of these results were
      statistically significant. CONCLUSION: In PCD, rapid food reintroduction
      following 6-week EEN is safe and equally effective as longer food reintroduction.
      We propose that a rapid food reintroduction schedule be recommended as the most
      tolerable approach for food reintroduction. Relapse rate and duration of
      remission are uninfluenced by the type of food reintroduction.

TI  - The role of total parenteral nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease: current
      aspects.
PG  - 3-14
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2013.860557 [doi]
AB  - Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) represents a therapeutic modality that could
      save the life of a patient with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) facing severe
      nutritional problems, by restoring the patient's impaired nutritional status. TPN
      does not compete with enteral nutrition (EN), the latter being the first choice
      for all patients having anatomically intact and functionally normal digestive
      tract. TPN allows bowel rest while supplying adequate calorific intake and
      essential nutrients, and removes antigenic mucosal stimuli. The value of TPN in
      malnourished patients with intestinal failure due to CD is beyond doubt. However,
      it is difficult to suggest TPN as a sole treatment for active CD. An increased
      rate of remission could not be expected by applying TPN. The utility of TPN is
      restricted to certain cases involving efforts to close enterocutaneous or other
      complicated fistulas in patients with fistulizing CD, the treatment of short
      bowel syndrome following extensive resections for CD, or when EN is impractical
      for other reasons. There are no advantages of TPN therapy over EN therapy
      regarding fistula healing. TPN has no influence on the surgical intervention rate
      and little benefit by bypassing the intestinal passage could be expected. Also
      TPN shows no advantage if the disease is chronically active. However, an optimal 
      supply of nutrients improves bowel motility, intestinal permeability and
      nutritional status, and reduces inflammatory reactions. TPN might be associated
      with an increased risk of adverse events, although TPN undertaken by experienced 
      teams does not cause more complications than does EN.

TI  - Candidate genes involved in beneficial or adverse responses to commonly eaten
      brassica vegetables in a New Zealand Crohn's disease cohort.
PG  - 5046-64
LID - 10.3390/nu5125046 [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) is one of the two manifestations of inflammatory bowel
      disease. Particular foods are thought with CD to exacerbate their illness.
      Vegetables, especially Brassicaceae, are often shunned by people with CD because 
      of the negative effects they are alleged to have on their symptoms. Brassicaceae 
      supply key nutrients which are necessary to meet recommended daily intakes. We
      sought to identify the candidate genes involved in the beneficial or adverse
      effects of Brassicaceae most commonly eaten, as reported by the New Zealand
      adults from the "Genes and Diet in Inflammatory Bowel disease Study" based in
      Auckland. An analysis of associations between the single nucleotide polymorphisms
      (SNPs) and the beneficial or adverse effects of the ten most commonly eaten
      Brassicaceae was carried out. A total of 37 SNPs were significantly associated
      with beneficial effects (p = 0.00097 to 0.0497) and 64 SNPs were identified with 
      adverse effects (p = 0.0000751 to 0.049). After correcting for multiple testing, 
      rs7515322 (DIO1) and rs9469220 (HLA) remained significant. Our findings show that
      the tolerance of some varieties of Brassicaceae may be shown by analysis of a
      person's genotype.

AB  - PURPOSE: To review the evidence supporting the validity of billing, procedural,
      or diagnosis code, or pharmacy claim-based algorithms used to identify patients
      with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in administrative and claim databases. METHODS: We
      searched the MEDLINE database from 1991 to September 2012 using controlled
      vocabulary and key terms related to RA and reference lists of included studies
      were searched. Two investigators independently assessed the full text of studies 
      against pre-determined inclusion criteria and extracted the data. Data collected 
      included participant and algorithm characteristics. RESULTS: Nine studies
      reported validation of computer algorithms based on International Classification 
      of Diseases (ICD) codes with or without free-text, medication use, laboratory
      data and the need for a diagnosis by a rheumatologist. These studies yielded
      positive predictive values (PPV) ranging from 34 to 97% to identify patients with
      RA. Higher PPVs were obtained with the use of at least two ICD and/or procedure
      codes (ICD-9 code 714 and others), the requirement of a prescription of a
      medication used to treat RA, or requirement of participation of a rheumatologist 
      in patient care. For example, the PPV increased from 66 to 97% when the use of
      disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and the presence of a positive rheumatoid
      factor were required. CONCLUSIONS: There have been substantial efforts to propose
      and validate algorithms to identify patients with RA in automated databases.
      Algorithms that include more than one code and incorporate medications or
      laboratory data and/or required a diagnosis by a rheumatologist may increase the 
      PPV.

AB  - Exclusive enteral nutrition is established as an initial therapy to induce
      remission in active Crohn's disease (CD), especially in children, but the
      mechanisms of action of this therapy are yet to be fully defined. CEACAM6 protein
      is an adhesion molecule that is up-regulated in active CD and implicated in the
      attachment of adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) to the gut epithelium.
      Using the Caco-2 human adenocarcinoma cell line, this study showed that the
      incubation of human cells with a polymeric formula (PF) resulted in a
      dose-dependent increase in the expression of CEACAM6, and that this effect was
      most noticeable on the cell surface. Further investigation revealed that PF
      doubled the release of CEACAM6 protein by Caco-2 cells exposed to PF, and that an
      increase in release of soluble CEACAM6 inversely correlated with the ability of
      AIEC to associate with the intestinal epithelial cells. Our findings suggest that
      the secretion of cell surface-associated proteins acting as releasable decoys may
      be an aspect of the gut's innate immune response to pathogenic bacteria that is
      strengthened by PF in the setting of CD.

LID - 10.1155/2013/789814 [doi]
AB  - The gut mucosa undergoes continuous antigenic exposure from food antigens,
      commensal flora derived ligands, and pathogens. This constant stimulation results
      in controlled inflammatory responses that are effectively suppressed by multiple 
      factors. This tight regulation, necessary to maintain intestinal homeostasis, is 
      affected during inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) resulting in altered immune
      responses to harmless microorganisms. Dendritic cells (DCs) are sentinels of
      immunity, located in peripheral and lymphoid tissues, which are essential for
      homeostasis of T cell-dependent immune responses. The expression of a particular 
      set of pathogen recognition receptors allows DCs to initiate immune responses.
      However, in the absence of danger signals, different DC subsets can induce active
      tolerance by inducing regulatory T cells (Treg), inhibiting inflammatory T helper
      cell responses, or both. Interestingly, several protocols to generate clinical
      grade tolerogenic DC (tol-DCs) in vitro have been described, opening the
      possibility to restore the intestinal homeostasis to bacterial flora by cellular 
      therapy. In this review, we discuss different DC subsets and their role in IBD.
      Additionally, we will review preclinical studies performed in animal models while
      describing recent characterization of tol-DCs from Crohn's disease patients for
      clinical application.

TI  - Environmental factors in a population-based inception cohort of inflammatory
      bowel disease patients in Europe--an ECCO-EpiCom study.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is
      increasing in Eastern Europe possibly due to changes in environmental factors
      towards a more "westernised" standard of living. The aim of this study was to
      investigate differences in exposure to environmental factors prior to diagnosis
      in Eastern and Western European IBD patients. METHODS: The EpiCom cohort is a
      population-based, prospective inception cohort of 1560 unselected IBD patients
      from 31 European countries covering a background population of 10.1 million. At
      the time of diagnosis patients were asked to complete an 87-item questionnaire
      concerning environmental factors. RESULTS: A total of 1182 patients (76%)
      answered the questionnaire, 444 (38%) had Crohn's disease (CD), 627 (53%)
      ulcerative colitis (UC), and 111 (9%) IBD unclassified. No geographic differences
      regarding smoking status, caffeine intake, use of oral contraceptives, or number 
      of first-degree relatives with IBD were found. Sugar intake was higher in CD and 
      UC patients from Eastern Europe than in Western Europe while fibre intake was
      lower (p<0.01). Daily consumption of fast food as well as appendectomy before the
      age of 20 was more frequent in Eastern European than in Western European UC
      patients (p<0.01). Eastern European CD and UC patients had received more
      vaccinations and experienced fewer childhood infections than Western European
      patients (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In this European population-based inception
      cohort of unselected IBD patients, Eastern and Western European patients differed
      in environmental factors prior to diagnosis. Eastern European patients exhibited 
      higher occurrences of suspected risk factors for IBD included in the Western
      lifestyle.

TI  - British Dietetic Association evidence-based guidelines for the dietary management
      of Crohn's disease in adults.
PG  - 207-18

AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is a debilitating chronic inflammatory bowel disease.
      Appropriate use of diet and nutritional therapy is integral to the overall
      management strategy of Crohn's disease. The aim was to develop evidence-based
      guidelines on the dietary management of Crohn's disease in adults. METHODS:
      Questions relating to the dietary management of Crohn's disease were developed.
      These included the roles of enteral nutrition to induce remission, food
      re-introduction diets to structure food re-introduction and maintain remission,
      and dietary management of stricturing disease, as well as whether probiotics or
      prebiotics induce or maintain remission. A comprehensive literature search was
      conducted and relevant studies from January 1985 to November 2009 were identified
      using the electronic database search engines CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EMBASE,
      MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Science. Evidence statements, recommendations,
      practical considerations and research recommendations were developed. RESULTS:
      Fifteen research papers were critically appraised and the evidence formed the
      basis of these guidelines. Although corticosteroids appear to be more effective, 
      enteral nutrition (elemental or non-elemental) can be offered as an alternative
      option to induce disease remission. After a course of enteral nutrition, food
      re-introduction diets may be useful to structure food re-introduction and help
      maintain disease remission. Dietary fibre is contraindicated in the presence of
      strictures as a result of the risk of mechanical obstruction. The use of
      probiotics and prebiotics is not currently supported. CONCLUSIONS: As an
      alternative to corticosteroids, evidence supports enteral nutrition to induce
      disease remission. Food re-introduction diets provide structure to food
      re-introduction and help maintain disease remission. These guidelines aim to
      reduce variation in clinical practice.

AB  - The diverse and complex community of microorganisms that has co-evolved with the 
      human gut is vital to intestinal functioning, and disturbances in the microbiota 
      and its relationship with the host immune system have been linked to inflammatory
      bowel diseases, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. This has
      suggested several treatment options, including antibiotics, probiotics and faecal
      transplantation. The human microbiome project has been established to enable
      comprehensive characterisation of the human microbiota and in the coming years,
      knowledge in this area is expected to continue to expand.

TI  - Polymorphisms in the sodium-dependent ascorbate transporter gene SLC23A1 are
      associated with susceptibility to Crohn disease.
PG  - 378-83
LID - 10.3945/ajcn.113.068015 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are 2 common
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) associated with intestinal inflammation and
      tissue damage. Oxidative stress is suggested to play a major role in the
      initiation and progression of IBD. Vitamin C (ascorbate, ascorbic acid)
      supplementation has reduced oxidative stress in persons with IBD. The role of
      ascorbate transporters in IBD remains to be determined. SLC23A1 is a major
      ascorbate transporter in the intestinal tract, and some of its genetic variants
      have been associated with severely decreased ascorbate transport and lower
      systemic concentrations. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether common 
      genetic variants in the vitamin C transporter SLC23A1 are associated with the
      risk of IBD. DESIGN: Genomic DNA samples from patients with CD (n = 162) and UC
      (n = 149) from the Manitoba IBD Cohort Study and ethnically matched controls (n =
      142) were genotyped for 3 SLC23A1 polymorphisms (rs6596473, rs33972313, and
      rs10063949) by using TaqMan assays. RESULTS: Variation at rs10063949 (G allele
      for heterozygote and homozygote) was associated with increased susceptibility to 
      CD (OR: 2.54; 95% CI: 1.38, 4.66; OR: 4.72; 95% CI: 2.53, 8.81; P < 0.0001;
      respectively). A strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) was observed across the
      SLC23A1 region (variation rs6596473 with rs10063949) for CD and UC (D' = 0.94 and
      0.96, respectively). The risk alleles confirmed a haplotype (CGG) that is carried
      more in CD patients (65.3%, P < 0.0001) than in controls (43.5%). CONCLUSIONS: A 
      genetic variant (rs10063949-G) in the SLC23A1 ascorbate transporter locus was
      identified and is associated with an increased risk of CD in a white Canadian IBD
      cohort. The presented evidence that SLC23A1 variations can modulate the risk of
      CD has implications for understanding ascorbate transport in CD patients and
      provides a novel opportunity toward individualized nutritional therapy for
      patients carrying the disease-associated genotype.

TI  - Effect of probiotics on inducing remission and maintaining therapy in ulcerative 
      colitis, Crohn's disease, and pouchitis: meta-analysis of randomized controlled
      trials.
PG  - 21-35
LID - 10.1097/01.MIB.0000437495.30052.be [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Whether probiotics are beneficial at all stages of treatment in
      inflammatory bowel disease or superior to placebo remains controversial. METHODS:
      Two reviewers independently selected randomized controlled trials comparing
      probiotics with controls in inflammatory bowel disease and extracted data related
      to remission/response rates, relapse rates, and adverse events. Subanalyses were 
      also performed. RESULTS: Twenty-three randomized controlled trials with a total
      of 1763 participants met the inclusion criteria. From the meta-analysis,
      probiotics significantly increase the remission rates in patients with active
      ulcerative colitis (UC) (P = 0.01, risk ratio [RR] = 1.51). The remission rates
      were significantly higher in patients with active UC treated with probiotics than
      placebo (P < 0.0001, RR = 1.80). Unfortunately, subgroup analysis found that only
      VSL#3 significantly increased the remission rates compared with controls in
      patients with active UC (P = 0.004, RR = 1.74). Interestingly, VSL#3 (P <
      0.00001, RR = 0.18) also significantly reduced the clinical relapse rates for
      maintaining remission in patients with pouchitis. No significantly different
      adverse events were detected between probiotics and controls in the treatment of 
      UC (P = 0.94, RR = 0.99) or CD (P = 0.33, RR = 0.87). CONCLUSIONS: Administration
      of probiotics results in additional benefit in inducing remission of patients
      with UC. VSL#3 are beneficial for maintaining remission in patients with
      pouchitis. And, probiotics can provide the similar effect as 5-aminosalicylic
      acid on maintaining remission of UC, although no additional adverse events
      presented.

TI  - High residential sun exposure is associated with a low risk of incident Crohn's
      disease in the prospective E3N cohort.
PG  - 75-81
LID - 10.1097/01.MIB.0000436275.12131.4f [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin D insufficiency has been suggested to be associated with high
      risk of Crohn's disease (CD). In France, where food fortification is limited, the
      major source of vitamin D is through sun exposure. The aim of this work was to
      analyze the relationship between residential sun exposure and the risk of
      incident CD or ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: The E3N cohort consists of women
      living in France, aged 40 to 65 years and free of major diseases at inclusion in 
      1990. Among the 91,870 women included in the study, we identified 123 incident
      cases (45 CD, 71 UC, and 7 indeterminate colitis). To assess residential sun
      exposure, we used a database containing mean daily ultraviolet radiation (UVR)
      dose for each French county. The relationship between residential sun exposure
      and risk of incident inflammatory bowel diseases was explored using Cox models.
      RESULTS: Higher levels of residential sun exposure were associated with a
      significant decreased risk of CD (hazard ratio [HR] for the third versus the
      first tertile of UVR dose, 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.23-1.01; P for
      trend = 0.04), but not of UC (HR, 1.21; CI, 0.61-2.11). In women with available
      data on dietary vitamin D intake, we observed a lower risk of CD with higher
      residential UVR (HR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.11-0.80; P for trend = 0.01). Dietary
      vitamin D intake was neither associated with the risk of CD (HR, 0.41; 95% CI,
      0.14-1.24; P for trend = 0.14) nor UC (HR, 1.61; CI, 0.61-4.23). CONCLUSIONS: In 
      this prospective cohort of women, high residential sunlight exposure was
      associated with decreased incidence of CD, but not UC.

AB  - Ample research has described multiple biological activities of probiotics in
      animals and in humans. Probiotics interfere with local and systemic immune
      reactions and thus exert an influence on the barrier function of the intestinal
      mucosa. Therefore, attempting inflammatory bowel disease treatment with
      probiotics seems reasonable. In fact, a growing number of trials have studied the
      therapeutic effects in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Promising results 
      have been found and in some, indications such as maintenance of remission of
      ulcerative colitis and pouchitis guidelines recommend therapy with probiotics
      already today. However, many open questions still remain and the urgent need for 
      high-quality trials requires much more research in the future.

AB  - The drugs available for inflammatory bowel disease are aminosalicylates,
      antibiotics, steroids, immunosuppressors and biologics. The effectiveness of
      these drugs has been evaluated in many randomized clinical trials, mainly versus 
      placebo. Few studies have been conducted comparing the different drugs among
      themselves, owing to the methodological problems raised by comparative trials,
      such as sample size and blindness. This review focuses mainly on the randomized
      clinical trials that have compared different treatments. Of course comparisons
      are mainly between drugs used in a particular setting (mild, moderate and severe 
      disease). However, on many occasions there is no homogeneity in these clinical
      settings, and therefore the results are difficult to interpret.

PG  - 1821-8
LID - 10.1556/OH.2013.29750 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vitamin D has an important role in the immune regulation. Vitamin D
      is essential for innate and adaptive immune systems and it plays a significant
      role in the formation of immune tolerance, as well. AIM: Vitamin D deficiency has
      been observed in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases in Western Europe, but
      there is no data available from Eastern Europe. METHOD: The study included 169
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease. RESULTS: The median vitamin D level was
      22.7+/-10.6 ng/ml. Only 20% of the patients had adequate vitamin D level (>30
      ng/ml), 52% had vitamin D insufficiency (15-30 ng/ml), and 28% of them had severe
      vitamin D deficiency (<15 ng/ml). Vitamin D concentration failed to correlate
      with clinical activity indexes (partial Mayo score: r = -0.143; Crohn's disease
      activity index: r = -0.253) and with inflammatory parameters (C-reactive protein:
      r = 0.008; erythrocyte sedimentation rate: r = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: Since vitamin
      D deficiency can be frequently observed in Hungarian patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease, its level should be tested in these patients.

AB  - Omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) have well documented
      anti-inflammatory properties, and consequently therapeutic potential in chronic
      inflammatory diseases. Here we discuss the effects of n-3 PUFAs on various
      inflammatory pathways and how this leads to alterations in the function of
      inflammatory cells, most importantly endothelial cells and leukocytes. Strong
      evidence indicates n-3 PUFAs are beneficial as a dietary supplement in certain
      diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis; however for other conditions such as
      asthma, the data are less robust. A clearer understanding of the pharmacology of 
      n-3 PUFAs will help to establish targets to modulate chronic inflammatory
      diseases.

AB  - Probiotics are nowadays frequently used by patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease, however literature data are conflicting related to their importance. In 
      mild to moderate ulcerative colitis probiotics can be used effectively in
      induction and maintaining remission, and prevention of pouchitis. As the other
      side of the shield, there is not sufficient evidence to support the use of
      probiotics in daily clinical practice in Crohn's disease. The aim of the present 
      review is to provide help for clinicians about the probiotic use in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease. The comparison of literature data is limited by the
      large number of probiotic strains, various combined preparations, and different
      doses applied in the clinical studies. Small number of comparable protocols and
      lack of standardization encumber the analysis of study results.

PG  - 477-80
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000221 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The base of human Peyer patches of the terminal ileum has been noted 
      to contain black granular pigment deposits, composed of titanium dioxide and
      aluminosilicate, which are food additives typically present in a Western diet,
      and pharmaceuticals. In the present study, we investigated the distribution of
      exogenous pigment throughout the gastrointestinal tract of children suspected of 
      having inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the correlation between their age and
      the presence and amount of pigment in Peyer patches, and its relation to
      pediatric IBD. METHODS: Biopsies (upper and lower gastrointestinal tract) from
      children suspected of having IBD who underwent endoscopy, were reassessed by a
      blinded, expert pathologist. The amount of pigment in biopsies was scored using a
      semiquantitative scale (range 0 to +++). RESULTS: A total of 151 children were
      included: 62 with Crohn disease (CD), 26 with ulcerative colitis, and 63 with
      non-IBD. In 63 children (42%), deposits of black pigment were found only in
      biopsies from the terminal ileum, located in Peyer patches. A significant
      correlation was found between increasing age and the amount of pigment (P =
      0.004). Pigment deposits were found significantly less in the patients with CD
      compared with those in patients with ulcerative colitis and those with non-IBD
      (26% vs 62% and 49%, P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: These results provide support for
      the hypothesis that the amount of pigment, only present in Peyer patches in the
      terminal ileum, becomes denser with increasing age. Absence of pigment in Peyer
      patches in a higher number of patients with CD suggests that microparticles may
      have become involved in the inflammatory process, possibly because of disrupted
      autophagy.

TI  - Vitamin D and Crohn's disease in the adult patient: a review.
PG  - 438-58
LID - 10.1177/0148607113506013 [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) is characterized as a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory
      disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. Current consensus surrounding the cause
      of the disease suggests a complex interplay between genetic susceptibility, the
      intestinal microbiome and environmental factors, leading to the aberrant Th1 and 
      Th17 immune cell mediated response. Vitamin D deficiency is common in CD
      patients, and long-standing deficiency has been associated with reduced bone
      mineral density (BMD). Accumulating evidence now suggests that in addition to
      maintaining skeletal integrity, vitamin D also plays an integral role in
      regulating the general immune response, a function employed via its genomic
      actions on the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The VDR is expressed in all immune cells
      and both directly and indirectly targeted by the bioactive form of vitamin D,
      1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]2D). Impaired regulation or deficiency of the
      vitamin has been linked to the promotion of self-reactive T cell development,
      loss of immune tolerance to self-structures, and experimental colitis in animal
      models, whereas the subsequent administration of the vitamin in these models
      resulted in the improvement of immune-mediated symptoms. In addition, low vitamin
      D has been associated with disease activity in CD patients, and supplementation
      appears to be beneficial in improving clinical scores and reducing inflammation. 
      Therefore, the primary aims of this article were to review the molecular evidence
      supporting the immunoregulatory roles of vitamin D and its supplementation in the
      CD patient, based on existing literature. The physiological processes, accepted
      serum concentration values, and its well-recognized role in bone health were also
      summarized.

TI  - Treatment of bone loss in osteopenic patients with Crohn's disease: a
      double-blind, randomised trial of oral risedronate 35 mg once weekly or placebo, 
      concomitant with calcium and vitamin D supplementation.
PG  - 1424-30
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2013-305523 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Osteoporosis and fractures are frequently encountered in patients with
      Crohn's disease. In order to prevent fractures, treatment with bone protecting
      drugs appears warranted early in the course of bone disease when bone loss is not
      yet prominent. We therefore aimed to demonstrate a beneficial effect on bone
      density of the bisphosphonate risedronate in osteopenic Crohn's disease patients.
      METHODS: This double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial of risedronate
      with calcium and vitamin D supplementation was performed in osteopenic Crohn's
      disease patients. Patients were treated for 2 years with follow-up after 3 and
      after every 6 months. Disease characteristics and activity and bone turnover
      markers were assessed at all visits; dual x-ray absorptiometry was performed at
      baseline, 12 and 24 months; radiographs of the spine at baseline and 24 months.
      RESULTS: Of 132 consenting patients, 131 were randomised (67 placebo and 64
      risedronate). Patient characteristics were similar in both groups, although the
      risedronate group was slightly heavier (body mass index 24.3 vs 23.0 kg/m(2)).
      Bone mineral density at lumbar spine increased 0.04 g/cm(2) on average in the
      risedronate group versus 0.01 g/cm(2) in the placebo group (p=0.007). The mean
      increase in total hip bone mineral density was 0.03 versus 0.01 g/cm(2),
      respectively (p=0.071). Fracture prevalence and incidence were similar. Change of
      T-scores and concentrations of bone turnover markers were consistent with a
      beneficial effect of risedronate when compared with placebo. The effect of
      risedronate was primarily demonstrated in the first 12 months of treatment. No
      serious unexpected suspected adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: A
      24-month treatment course with risedronate 35 mg once weekly, concomitant with
      calcium and vitamin D supplementation, in osteopenic Crohn's disease patients
      improved bone density at lumbar spine. NTR 163 Dutch Trial Register.

AB  - Over the last decade, WCE has established itself as a valuable test for imaging
      the small intestine. It is a safe and relatively easy procedure to perform that
      can provide valuable information in the diagnosis of small-bowel conditions. Its 
      applications still remain limited within the esophagus and colon. Future
      developments may include improving visualization within the esophagus and
      developing technologies that may allow manipulation of the capsule within the GI 
      tract and biopsy capabilities.

TI  - Review article: the association of diet with onset and relapse in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1172-87
LID - 10.1111/apt.12501 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of diet in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is supported by 
      migration studies and increasing incidences in line with Westernisation. AIM: To 
      give a complete overview of studies associating habitual diet with the onset or
      relapses in ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: A
      structured search in Pubmed, the Cochrane Library and EMBASE was performed using 
      defined key words, including only full text papers in English language. RESULTS: 
      Forty-one studies were identified, investigating onset (n = 35), relapses (n = 5)
      or both (n = 1). Several studies reported high intake of sugar or
      sugar-containing foods (n = 7 UC, n = 12 CD), and low intake of fruits and/or
      vegetables (n = 5 UC, n = 10 CD) to be associated with an increased onset risk.
      However, these findings could not be confirmed by similar or higher numbers of
      other studies. A possible protective role was found for grain-derived products in
      CD onset, but results were inconsistent for dietary fibre in UC and CD and
      grain-derived products in UC. No definite conclusions could be drawn for
      unsaturated fatty acids (UFA), protein and energy intake due to limited and/or
      inconsistent results. Six studies reported on diet and relapse risk, of which
      only two (n = 1 UC, n = 1 CD) had a prospective follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The
      current evidence is not sufficient to draw firm conclusions on the role of
      specific food components or nutrients in the aetiology of IBD. Furthermore, large
      prospective studies into the role of habitual diet as a trigger of relapses are
      needed, to identify new therapeutic or preventive targets.

TI  - Transforming growth factor and intestinal inflammation: the role of nutrition.
PG  - 91-8
LID - 10.1159/000351390 [doi]
AB  - The intestinal mucosa possesses a complex epithelial barrier and a well-organized
      local immune system, which both efficiently protect this internal-external
      surface against potential microbial aggressions while guaranteeing tolerance
      towards harmless bacteria or antigens (oral tolerance). There is good
      experimental evidence that the intestinal microbiota is a main driver for the
      development of the mucosal immune system. Any perturbations/changes of this
      interaction with the intestinal microbiota or the microbial colonization process 
      may cause health problems with short- and eventually long-term consequences, such
      as suspected for allergic or dysimmune disorders. Dendritic cells (DC) play a key
      role in the initiation of immune responses. Immune responses elicited by
      intestinal DC differ markedly from those initiated by spleen-derived DC: while
      intestinal DC induce anti-inflammatory and tolerogenic responses to harmless
      antigens such as derived from the resident microflora or harmless food allergens,
      systemic immune activation yields in a strong inflammatory TH1/TH17 reaction to
      the same antigens. The recent discovery how DC functions are regulated and
      imprinted by the microenvironment (DC conditioning) will be discussed in this
      review. High concentrations of retinoic acid or vitamin D metabolites, thymic
      stromal lymphopoietin and/or transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) activate 
      signaling programs in DC that yield in priming of regulatory and
      anti-inflammatory T cell responses. TGF-beta is one of the key factors implicated
      in intestinal immune regulation; it is produced by a large variety of cells in
      the intestinal mucosa, including intestinal epithelial cells, lymphocytes and
      monocytes/macrophages/DC. An important anti-inflammatory effect of TGF-beta on
      the immune system is the promotion and generation of FOXP3-positive regulatory T 
      cells in the intestinal compartment. There are first and encouraging data from
      the treatment of Crohn's disease, an inflammatory GI condition, that targeted
      enteral therapy with optimized concentrations of immunoregulatory peptides, such 
      as TGF-beta, might of interest for the treatment of inflammatory disorders.

AB  - Patients have strong beliefs about the role of diet in the cause of inflammatory 
      bowel disease (IBD) and in exacerbating or alleviating ongoing symptoms from IBD.
      The rapid increase in the incidence and prevalence of IBD in recent decades
      strongly suggests an environmental trigger for IBD, one of which may be dietary
      patterns. There are several pathways where diet may influence intestinal
      inflammation, such as direct dietary antigens, altering the gut microbiome, and
      affecting gastrointestinal permeability. However, data that altering diet can
      change the natural history of IBD are scarce, and evidence-based dietary
      guidelines for patients with IBD are lacking. Patients, therefore, seek
      nonmedical resources for dietary guidance, such as patient support groups and
      unverified sources on the Internet. The aim of this review is to identify
      patient-targeted dietary recommendations for IBD and to critically appraise the
      nutritional value of these recommendations. We review patient-targeted dietary
      information for IBD from structured Internet searches and popular defined diets. 
      Patient-targeted dietary recommendations focus on food restrictions and are
      highly conflicting. High-quality dietary intervention studies are needed to
      facilitate creation of evidence-based dietary guidelines for patients with IBD.

      bowel disease.
PG  - 1156-71

AB  - BACKGROUND: The therapeutic effect of enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease (CD)
      and the epidemiological associations between diet and inflammatory bowel disease 
      (IBD) implicate diet in IBD causation. There is little evidence, however, to
      support specific dietary changes and patients often receive contradictory advice.
      AIM: To review the literature on the impacts of diet on IBD causation and
      activity to produce guidance based on 'best available evidence'. METHOD: Review
      of Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases from 1975 to 2012 using MeSH headings
      'crohn's disease' 'ulcerative colitis' 'enteral' 'diet' 'nutrition' 'fatty acid' 
      and 'food additives'. RESULTS: Enteral nutrition with a formula-defined feed is
      effective treatment for CD, but approximately 50% of patients relapse within 6
      months of return to normal diet. There is no direct evidence of benefit from any 
      other specific dietary modification in CD, but indirect evidence supports
      recommendation of a low intake of animal fat, insoluble fibre and processed fatty
      foods containing emulsifiers. Foods tolerated in sustained remission may not be
      tolerated following relapse. Some evidence supports vitamin D supplementation. In
      ulcerative colitis (UC), evidence is weaker, but high intakes of meat and
      margarine correlate with increased UC incidence and high meat intake also
      correlates with increased likelihood of relapse. CONCLUSIONS: There is little
      evidence from interventional studies to support specific dietary recommendations.
      Nevertheless, people with IBD deserve advice based on 'best available evidence'
      rather than no advice at all, although dietary intake should not be
      inappropriately restrictive. Further interventional studies of dietary
      manipulation are urgently required.

TI  - ColoPulse tablets perform comparably in healthy volunteers and Crohn's patients
      and show no influence of food and time of food intake on bioavailability.

AB  - ColoPulse tablets are an innovative development in the field of oral drug
      delivery and are characterized by a colon-specific release. Until now ColoPulse
      dosage forms (only capsules) have been studied in healthy volunteers having a
      standardized breakfast three hours after administration but not in specific
      patient groups and not with a shorter interval between administration and
      breakfast. Information on bioavailability and release characteristics of
      ColoPulse tablets in Crohn's patients and the influence of food and time of food 
      intake is a prerequisite to properly design future clinical studies with active
      substances in these patients. In the current cross-over study bioavailability and
      drug release characteristics of ColoPulse tablets were compared in healthy
      volunteers and in Crohn's patients in remission. Furthermore the influence of
      food and time of food intake on the in vivo drug release behavior of ColoPulse
      tablets was investigated. In this study the dual label isotope strategy was used 
      which means that a ColoPulse tablet containing (13)C-urea and an uncoated,
      immediate release tablet containing (15)N2-urea were taken simultaneously. Breath
      and urine samples were collected during the test day for isotope analysis. The
      appearance of the stable isotopes in breath and/or urine provides information on 
      the site of release from the dosage form, release characteristics and
      bioavailability. Both tablets were administered on two different days in a
      cross-over design: the first day with a breakfast (non-standardized) one hour
      after administration and the second day with a standardized breakfast three hours
      after administration of the tablets. There was no difference in instructions for 
      administration between both days. Results of 16 healthy volunteers and 14 Crohn's
      patients were evaluated. At least 86% (51 out of 59) of all ColoPulse tablets
      administered in this study released their contents at the desired intestinal
      region. There was no significant difference in bioavailability between healthy
      volunteers and Crohn's patients on both days (day 1 75.8% vs 90.2%, p=0.070 and
      day 2 83.4% vs 91.4%, p=0.265). There was also no significant influence of food
      and time of food intake on bioavailability in healthy volunteers (75.8% and
      83.4%, p=0.077) and in Crohn's patients (90.2% and 91.4%, p=0.618) when day 1 and
      day 2 were compared. Release characteristics did not significantly differ between
      healthy volunteers and Crohn's patients. However, food and time of food intake
      had some, clinically non-relevant, influence on the release characteristics
      within both groups which is in line with the fact that food affects
      gastro-intestinal transit times. This study shows that ColoPulse tablets enable
      the site-specific delivery of drugs or other compounds (e.g. diagnostics) deep in
      the ileo-colonic region of the intestine of Crohn's patients in a comparable
      amount and rate as in healthy volunteers. Food and time of food intake had no
      relevant influence on bioavailability. In conclusion ColoPulse delivery systems
      are promising and deserve further research for local therapy with
      immunosuppressive drugs in Crohn's patients in the near future.

AB  - The cell-membrane toxicity of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) plays
      an increasing role in the pathomechanism of gastrointestinal tract diseases.
      Trace elements are important parts of antioxidant protecting system, especially
      the selenium (Se), which, in the form of glutathione peroxidase contributes to
      the immunity of the gut (GALT). Due to the absorptional disorders and consequent 
      malnutrition observed in the course of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) an
      important role is associated with nutritional therapy, including energy-,
      protein- and trace element-support. Human studies show, that IBD is mostly
      accompanied by lower serum Se concentrations, reduced antoxidant and increased
      proinflammatory activity. Adequate Se-replacement may reduce the severity of
      organ failure and infections, but not mortality. However, it is encouraging that 
      in animal studies obvious preventive effect of Se has been found on IBD and
      chronic inflammation induced colon cancer .

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Osteopenia and increased risk for fractures in IBD result from
      several factors. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the dietary intake of calcium
      in IBD patients. METHODS: A 22-item quantitative validated frequency food
      questionnaire was used for quantifying dietary calcium in relation to gender and 
      age, in 187 IBD patients, 420 normal- and 276 diseased controls. STATISTICAL
      ANALYSIS: Mann-Whitney, chi-square- and T-tests. RESULTS: The mean calcium intake
      was 991.0 +/- 536.0 (105.8% Recommended Daily Allowances) and 867.6 +/- 562.7 SD 
      mg/day (93.8% RDA) in healthy and diseased controls, and 837.8 +/- 482.0 SD
      mg/day (92.7% RDA) in IBD, P<0.001. Calcium intake was high in celiac disease
      (1165.7 +/- 798.8 SD mg/day, 120% RDA), and non-significantly lower in ulcerative
      colitis than in Crohn's disease (798.7 +/- 544.1 SD mg/day vs 881.9 +/- 433.0).
      CD and UC females, but not males, had a mean calcium intake well under RDA. In
      all study groups the intake was lower in patients believing that consumption of
      lactose-containing food induced symptoms, versus those who did not (105.8% vs
      114.3% RDA in normal controls; 100.4% vs 87.6% RDA in IBD). CONCLUSIONS: Diet in 
      IBD patients contained significantly less calcium than in healthy controls.
      Gender and age, more than diagnosis, are central in determining inadequate
      calcium intake, more so in IBD. Self-reported lactose intolerance, leading to
      dietary restrictions, is the single major determinant of low calcium intake.
      Inadequate calcium intake is present in one third of IBD patients and represents 
      a reversible risk factor for osteoporosis, suggesting the need for tailored
      nutritional advice in IBD.

AB  - The experiences of individuals with Crohn disease before and after receiving
      dietary fiber information have not been described in the literature. This article
      offers findings from a study that used four semistructured audiorecorded
      interviews during a 4-week time period for the purpose of exploring the
      experiences of 11 individuals before and after receiving dietary fiber
      information from a healthcare professional. The first and second interviews
      occurred immediately before and after the presentation of information. Follow-up 
      interviews occurred at 2-week intervals. Thematic analysis of the baseline
      interviews revealed 2 themes: (a) accepting a redefined (lower expectations)
      definition of normal quality of life and (b) continuing to look for answers.
      Three themes emerged from the follow-up interviews at Week 4: (a) reevaluating
      old diet-related concepts, (b) enjoying a healthier lifestyle at a self-set pace,
      and (c) enjoying positive physical effects of wheat bran consumption. This
      article examines the 3rd postintervention theme, "enjoying physical effects of
      wheat bran consumption." The relevance of this research is that nurses equipped
      with dietary fiber information may be better able to help some individuals with
      Crohn disease to explore the potential benefits of a well-rounded nutritious
      pattern of eating that includes wheat bran cereal.

TI  - A rare case of free bowel perforation associated with infliximab treatment for
      stricturing Crohn's disease.
PG  - 169-73
AB  - Crohn's disease is characterized by chronic transmural inflammation of the bowel 
      and is associated with serious complications, such as bowel strictures,
      abscesses, fistula formation, and perforation. As neither medical nor surgical
      therapy provides a cure for Crohn's disease, the primary goals of therapy are to 
      induce and maintain remission and prevent complications. As a biologic agent,
      infliximab, a monoclonal antibody to tumor necrosis factor, is indicated for
      refractory luminal and fistulizing Crohn's disease that does not respond to other
      medical therapies or surgery. Infliximab has proven to be very effective for
      inducing and maintaining remission in Crohn's disease; however, infliximab
      treatment has several potential complications. Here, we report a case of free
      perforation following a therapeutic response after an initial dose of infliximab 
      for Crohn's disease. This is the first case report describing a free perforation 
      in a Crohn's disease patient after an initial dose of infliximab.

LID - S1743-9191(13)01045-5 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the spectrum of
      colonic microflora in patients with colitis and if this could be altered with one
      month's treatment with synbiotics. METHODS: This was a pilot study in which
      patients were randomised to either receive a synbiotics preparation for a month
      and then "crossed over" to receive a placebo, or alternatively to receive the
      placebo first followed in the second month by synbiotic. Stool samples were
      collected on entry into the study and then at the end of first and second months 
      respectively. Colonic microflora was measured by terminal restriction fragment
      length polymorphism technique. Quantitative PCR was used to determine the
      concentration of individual species. RESULTS: Sixteen patients completed the
      study of whom 8 had Crohn's colitis and 8 had ulcerative colitis. Their median
      age was 62 (IQR 50-65) years. An average of 22 terminal restriction fragments
      (T-RF's) was identified in each patient. Dice cluster analysis showed that each
      patient had a unique microbial composition which did not change significantly at 
      different time points in the study, irrespective of whether they had probiotics
      or the placebo. Probiotic organisms were identified in stool samples but did not 
      alter overall spectrum of microflora. In this pilot study we were unable to
      identify any specific characteristics related to nature of colitis. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This study suggests that there is no difference in colonic microflora between
      patients with Crohn's or Ulcerative colitis and that the spectrum of bacteria was
      not altered by synbiotic administration.

TI  - Nutritional therapy in pediatric Crohn disease: the specific carbohydrate diet.
PG  - 87-91
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000103 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Crohn disease is characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation in 
      the absence of a recognized etiology. Nutritional therapy in the form of
      exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) has an established role within pediatric Crohn 
      disease. Following exclusive enteral nutrition's success, many dietary therapies 
      focusing on the elimination of specific complex carbohydrates have been
      anecdotally reported to be successful. METHODS: Many of these therapies have not 
      been evaluated scientifically; therefore, we reviewed the medical records of our 
      patients with Crohn disease on the specific carbohydrate diet (SCD). RESULTS:
      Seven children with Crohn disease receiving the SCD and no immunosuppressive
      medications were retrospectively evaluated. Duration of the dietary therapy
      ranged from 5 to 30 months, with an average of 14.6+/-10.8 months. Although the
      exact time of symptom resolution could not be determined through chart review,
      all symptoms were notably resolved at a routine clinic visit 3 months after
      initiating the diet. Each patient's laboratory indices, including serum albumin, 
      C-reactive protein, hematocrit, and stool calprotectin, either normalized or
      significantly, improved during follow-up clinic visits. CONCLUSIONS: This chart
      review suggests that the SCD and other low complex carbohydrate diets may be
      possible therapeutic options for pediatric Crohn disease. Further prospective
      studies are required to fully assess the safety and efficacy of the SCD, or any
      other low complex SCDs in pediatric patients with Crohn disease.

TI  - T300A variant of autophagy ATG16L1 gene is associated with decreased antigen
      sampling and processing by dendritic cells in pediatric Crohn's disease.
PG  - 2339-48
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0b013e3182a6a11c [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The single-nucleotide polymorphism T300A of ATG16L1, a Crohn's
      disease (CD)-associated gene, is responsible for decreased autophagy. This study 
      aimed to investigate the effects of this single-nucleotide polymorphism on the
      uptake and processing of antigens by dendritic cells (DCs) and the interaction
      between DC and intestinal epithelium in pediatric patients with CD. METHODS:
      Pediatric patients who homozygously carry either the protective (wild type, n =
      7) or risk allele (risk, n = 13) of ATG16L1, as well as heterozygous patients
      (het, n = 13) were enrolled. The monocyte-derived DC were analyzed for phenotype,
      antigen sampling, and processing by flow cytometry, whereas the capability of DC 
      to form transepithelial protrusions was determined by confocal microscopy.
      RESULTS: DC generated from wild type patients showed higher bacteria sampling and
      antigen processing compared with risk patients. Additionally, after exposure to
      either bacteria particles or the antigen DQ-ovalbumin, wild type DC showed a
      significant increase in the expression of the HLA-DR and CD86 when compared with 
      risk DC. Interestingly, also het patients showed an impairment in bacteria uptake
      and expression of activation marker when compared with the wild type. In the
      Caco2/DC coculture, the formation of transepithelial protrusions were less
      numerous in risk DC compared with wild type and the antigen uptake decreased.
      CONCLUSIONS: DC of pediatric patients with CD carrying the T300A allele showed a 
      marked impairment of antigen uptake and processing and defective interactions
      between DC and intestinal epithelium. Collectively, our results suggest that an
      autophagy defect is associated with an impairment of intestinal innate immunity
      in pediatric CD.

TI  - A prospective study of long-term intake of dietary fiber and risk of Crohn's

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Increased intake of dietary fiber has been proposed to reduce 
      the risk of inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease [CD] and ulcerative
      colitis [UC]). However, few prospective studies have examined associations
      between long-term intake of dietary fiber and risk of incident CD or UC. METHODS:
      We collected and analyzed data from 170,776 women, followed up over 26 years, who
      participated in the Nurses' Health Study, followed up for 3,317,425 person-years.
      Dietary information was prospectively ascertained via administration of a
      validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire every 4 years.
      Self-reported CD and UC were confirmed through review of medical records. Cox
      proportional hazards models, adjusting for potential confounders, were used to
      calculate hazard ratios (HRs). RESULTS: We confirmed 269 incident cases of CD
      (incidence, 8/100,000 person-years) and 338 cases of UC (incidence, 10/100,000
      person-years). Compared with the lowest quintile of energy-adjusted cumulative
      average intake of dietary fiber, intake of the highest quintile (median of 24.3
      g/day) was associated with a 40% reduction in risk of CD (multivariate HR for CD,
      0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.39-0.90). This apparent reduction appeared to be
      greatest for fiber derived from fruits; fiber from cereals, whole grains, or
      legumes did not modify risk. In contrast, neither total intake of dietary fiber
      (multivariate HR, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.58-1.17) nor intake of fiber
      from specific sources appeared to be significantly associated with risk of UC.
      CONCLUSIONS: Based on data from the Nurses' Health Study, long-term intake of
      dietary fiber, particularly from fruit, is associated with lower risk of CD but
      not UC. Further studies are needed to determine the mechanisms that mediate this 
      association.

TI  - Teduglutide in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1207-14
LID - 10.1517/14712598.2013.815721 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The currently available medications for treatment of Crohn's
      disease (CD) include aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, antibiotics,
      immunomodulators and biologic agents (infliximab, certolizumab pegol, adalimumab 
      and natalizumab). These agents target the immune and inflammatory pathways of CD,
      while there is a shortage of agents that target the barrier functions of the gut 
      that are impaired in CD. Glucagon-like peptide 2 is an enterogastrone with strong
      trophic effects on the intestinal mucosa. Teduglutide , the analog of
      glucagon-like peptide has been already approved by the US Food and Drug
      Administration as a treatment of short bowel syndrome. This review discusses the 
      potential use of teduglutide in patients with CD. AREAS COVERED: As there has
      been only one randomized placebo controlled trial of teduglutide in CD, there is 
      a shortage of data regarding the efficacy of this agent in CD. The literature
      search was performed using Medline database with the use of the following key
      words: teduglutide, glucagon-like peptide-2, CD and inflammatory bowel disease.
      EXPERT OPINION: Based on available data, it can be concluded that this agent
      seems to be a promising medication in CD and further trials are required to
      define the place of teduglutide in treatment of CD.

TI  - Long-term intake of dietary fat and risk of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 776-84
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2013-305304 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dietary fats influence intestinal inflammation and regulate mucosal
      immunity. Data on the association between dietary fat and risk of Crohn's disease
      (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are limited and conflicting. METHODS: We
      conducted a prospective study of women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study
      cohorts. Diet was prospectively ascertained every 4 years using a validated
      semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Self-reported CD and UC were
      confirmed through medical record review. We examined the effect of
      energy-adjusted cumulative average total fat intake and specific types of fat and
      fatty acids on the risk of CD and UC using Cox proportional hazards models
      adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: Among 170,805 women, we confirmed
      269 incident cases of CD (incidence 8/100,000 person-years) and 338 incident
      cases of UC (incidence 10/100,000 person-years) over 26 years and 3,317,338
      person-years of follow-up. Cumulative energy-adjusted intake of total fat,
      saturated fats, unsaturated fats, n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)
      were not associated with risk of CD or UC. However, greater intake of long-chain 
      n-3 PUFAs was associated with a trend towards lower risk of UC (HR 0.72, 95% CI
      0.51 to 1.01). In contrast, high long-term intake of trans-unsaturated fatty
      acids was associated with a trend towards an increased incidence of UC (HR 1.34, 
      95% CI 0.94 to 1.92). CONCLUSIONS: A high intake of dietary long-chain n-3 PUFAs 
      may be associated with a reduced risk of UC. In contrast, high intake of
      trans-unsaturated fats may be associated with an increased risk of UC.

TI  - Use of case reports and the Adverse Event Reporting System in systematic reviews:
      overcoming barriers to assess the link between Crohn's disease medications and
      hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma.
PG  - 53
LID - 10.1186/2046-4053-2-53 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To identify demographic and clinical characteristics associated with 
      cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) in patients with Crohn's disease, 
      and to assess strength of evidence for a causal relationship between medications 
      and HSTCL in Crohn's disease. METHODS: We identified cases of HSTCL in Crohn's
      disease in studies included in a comparative effectiveness review of Crohn's
      disease medications, through a separate search of PubMed and Embase for published
      case reports, and from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event
      Reporting System (AERS). We used three causality assessment tools to evaluate the
      relationship between medication exposure and HSTCL. RESULTS: We found 37 unique
      cases of HSTCL in patients with Crohn's disease. Six cases were unique to the
      published literature and nine were unique to AERS. Cases were typically young
      (<40 years of age) and male (86%). The most commonly reported medications were
      anti-metabolites (97%) and anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFa)
      medications (76%). Dose and duration of therapy were not consistently reported.
      Use of aminosalicylates and corticosteroids were rarely reported, despite the
      high prevalence of these medications in routine treatment. Using the causality
      assessment tools, it could only be determined that anti-metabolite and anti-TNFa 
      therapies were possible causes of HSTCL in Crohn's disease based on the data
      contained in the case reports. CONCLUSION: Systematic reviews that incorporate
      case reports of rare lethal events should search both published literature and
      AERS, but consideration should be given to the limitations of case reports. In
      this study, establishing a causative effect other than 'possible' between
      anti-metabolite or anti-TNFa therapies and HSTCL was not feasible because case
      reports lacked data required by the causality assessments, and because of the
      limited applicability of causality assessment tools for rare irreversible events.
      We recommend minimum reporting requirements for case reports to improve causality
      assessment and routine reporting of rare life-threatening events, including their
      absence, in clinical trials to help clinicians determine whether rare adverse
      events are causally related to a medication.

      consumption.
PG  - 872632
LID - 10.1155/2013/872632 [doi]
AB  - Both ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and Crohn's disease (CD) are chronic and
      potentially disabling interrelated conditions, which have been included under the
      group of spondyloarthropathies. The results of a large number of studies support 
      the idea that an enteropathic pathogen, Klebsiella pneumoniae, is the most likely
      triggering factor involved in the initiation and development of these diseases.
      Increased starch consumptions by genetically susceptible individuals such as
      those possessing HLA-B27 allelotypes could trigger the disease in both AS and CD 
      by enhancing the growth and perpetuation of the Klebsiella microbes in the bowel.
      Exposure to increased levels of these microbes will lead to the production of
      elevated levels of anti-Klebsiella antibodies as well as autoantibodies against
      cross-reactive self-antigens with resultant pathological lesions in the bowel and
      joints. Hence, a decrease of starch-containing products in the daily dietary
      intake could have a beneficial therapeutic effect on the disease especially when 
      used in conjunction with the currently available medical therapies in the
      treatment of patients with AS and CD.

      dietary survey.
PG  - 240-6
LID - 10.1159/000348850 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently, the only treatment for celiac disease (CD) is a lifelong
      gluten-free diet (GFD). Research has been carried out in various countries into
      the nutritional adequacy of the GFD in terms of macro- and micronutrients, mostly
      presenting conflicting results. However, no data for Germany are available to
      date. AIM: To elucidate the nutritional composition of a GFD and to compare it
      with non-GFD in a representative German non-CD population. METHODS AND PATIENTS: 
      A total of 1,000 patients who were members of the German Celiac Society (DZG)
      were invited to fill out a prospective 7-day food diary and a questionnaire. Data
      from 88 patients aged 14-80 years were analyzed and compared to the DACH
      reference values and to data from the German National Diet and Nutrition Survey
      (NVS II). RESULTS: No significant difference was observed for the intake of
      energy and macronutrients in male celiac patients compared to the NVS II. Only
      the fiber intake of male patients was significantly lower than that of the
      general population. Female patients, however, showed a significantly higher fat
      intake, but lower carbohydrate consumption. The average daily micronutrient
      intake of male and female patients, specifically of vitamin B1, B2, B6, folic
      acid, magnesium and iron, was significantly lower in celiac patients compared to 
      the NVS II. CONCLUSION: This study reveals inadequate nutrient intake by male and
      female celiac patients in Germany. Based on our findings, regular (laboratory)
      monitoring of celiac patients should be recommended.

AB  - Surgery is an almost inevitable event in Crohn's disease but is not curative;
      post-operative recurrence follows a sequential and predictable course. Prevention
      of post-operative recurrence in Crohn's disease is therefore a relevant problem
      in the management of the disease. Several drugs have been evaluated to decrease
      the risk of recurrence: these include mesalazine, antibiotics, probiotics,
      budesonide, thiopurines and biologic agents. This review focuses on the
      randomised controlled trials and meta-analyses addressing different drugs and
      strategies for preventing post-operative recurrence in Crohn's disease.

AB  - This integrative literature review focused on the use of omega-3 fatty acid
      supplementation for the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD). A systematic review of
      studies investigating the use of omega-3 in individuals with CD was performed.
      OVID MEDLINE, the Cochrane Database, and CINAHL were searched for pertinent
      research. Experiments were limited to double-blind placebo controlled trials.
      Five studies observing CD relapse rates and three studies examining biochemical
      changes were evaluated. The studies reviewed show contradicting information
      regarding the efficacy of omega-3 for CD. While some studies have shown
      supplementation with omega-3 results in sustained remission from disease, other
      studies concluded no correlation between omega-3 supplementation and improved
      remission rates. Studies investigating biochemical variables suggest favorable
      changes in immunological milieu, including modifications of lipid profiles and
      cytokine production. The studies reviewed are adversely limited by low number of 
      participants, short duration of study and other significant deficits. Limited
      data remain available and current literature indicated mixed conclusions
      regarding the efficacy of omega-3 for treatment of CD. Further large-scale
      studies of longer duration are necessary.

AB  - The pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease is still incompletely
      understood. While the development of the immune system and the establishment of
      the microflora take place during infancy young patients often have a more severe 
      and extensive disease. The differences in composition and concentration of
      intestinal microbiota and aberrant immune responses towards the luminal bacteria 
      prompted the concept of an 'ecological' approach to control the disease course.
      Probiotics, living, non pathogenic micro organisms with a beneficial effect on
      the host, and prebiotics, oligosaccharides promoting the growth of the beneficial
      microflora, have been studied to this effect. Results have so far been
      disappointing for Crohn's disease but encouraging for ulcerative colitis. An
      overview of studies using probiotics in adults or children and a perspective on
      specific pediatric issues is provided in this review.

AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) is characterized by transmural inflammation that is most
      frequently located in the region of the terminal ileum. Although the
      physiopathological mechanisms of the disease are not yet well defined, the
      unregulated immune response is associated with high production of reactive oxygen
      species (ROS). These elements are associated with complex systems known as
      antioxidant defenses, whose function is ROS regulation, thereby preventing the
      harmful effects of these elements. However, the presence of an imbalance between 
      ROS production and ROS elimination by antioxidants has been widely described and 
      leads to oxidative stress. In this article, we describe the most significant
      findings on oxidative stress in the intestinal mucosa and peripheral blood.

TI  - Janus kinase inhibition with tofacitinib: changing the face of inflammatory bowel
      disease treatment.
PG  - 1385-91
AB  - The advent of anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) therapy has changed the way of
      treating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, primary and secondary failure
      are relatively frequent with all anti-TNF agents, which are available only as
      parenteral agents. Tofacitinib is an oral janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that
      inhibits JAK family kinase members, in particular JAK1 and JAK3, achieving a
      broad limitation of inflammation by interfering with several cytokine receptors. 
      It first proved its efficacy as an immunosuppressive regimen after renal
      transplantation, and was recently approved by the FDA for rheumatoid arthritis.
      First data in IBD are promising, especially in ulcerative colitis. Ongoing
      clinical trials in both UC and Crohn's disease (CD) are needed to further explore
      its efficacy in CD and to better assess its safety profile.

TI  - Development of a low phenolic acid diet for the management of orofacial
      granulomatosis.
PG  - 527-37
LID - 10.1111/jhn.12046 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Orofacial granulomatosis (OFG) is a rare disease of unknown cause. A 
      cinnamon- and benzoate-free diet is successful in up to 72% of patients. Phenolic
      acids are among the chemical constituents restricted in this diet, which avoids
      some but not all of these structurally similar compounds. The present study aimed
      to: (i) develop a novel diet low in phenolic acids; (ii) implement this in a
      small clinical trial; and (iii) assess its nutritional adequacy. METHODS: A
      literature review identified 10 papers quantifying phenolic acids from which 91
      10-mg phenolic acid exchanges were devised. A phenolic acid exclusion diet with
      precautionary micronutrient supplementation was designed and implemented in 10
      patients. Phenolic acids were excluded for 6 weeks and were reintroduced at a
      rate of one exchange every second day for 6 weeks. Wilcoxon matched pairs tests
      analysed disease outcomes measured by an oral disease severity scoring tool at
      weeks 0, 6 and 12. Nutritional adequacy was assessed, excluding micronutrient
      supplementation, at weeks 0 and 6, and compared intakes with dietary reference
      values. RESULTS: The diet was nutritionally inadequate for a range of
      micronutrients. Seven of 10 patients responded. Mean [standard deviation (SD)]
      severity scores improved from week 0-6 [20.8 (9.39) and 10.1 (5.72); P = 0.009]
      and were maintained in five patients who completed the reintroduction [6.6 (3.13)
      and 7.2 (5.54); P = 0.713]. CONCLUSIONS: A low phenolic acid diet with
      micronutrient supplementation holds promise of a novel dietary treatment for OFG.
      Further work is required in larger studies to determine long-term outcomes.

TI  - The human gut microbiome: a review of the effect of obesity and surgically
      induced weight loss.
PG  - 563-9
LID - 10.1001/jamasurg.2013.5 [doi]
AB  - Recent advances in parallel genomic processing and computational mapping have
      been applied to the native human microbial environment to provide a new
      understanding of the role of the microbiome in health and disease. In particular,
      studies of the distal gut microbiome have proposed that changes in gut microbiota
      are related to obesity, the metabolic syndrome, and Western diet. We examined the
      changes in the distal gut microbiome composition as it relates to the lean and
      obese phenotypes, particularly after surgical weight loss. A PubMed search of
      publications from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2012, used the search
      terms weight, obesity, microbiome, and bariatric surgery. We included studies
      that provided information on subjects' weight and/or body mass index and a formal
      assessment of the microbiome. Certain bacteria, specifically the archaeon
      Methanobrevibacter smithii, have enhanced ability to metabolize dietary
      substrate, thereby increasing host energy intake and weight gain. With weight
      loss, there is a decrease in the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes phyla. One 
      major finding from microbial sequencing analyses after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass
      is the comparative overabundance of Proteobacteria in the distal gut microbiome, 
      which is distinct from the changes seen in weight loss without Roux-en-Y gastric 
      bypass. This review provides the practicing surgeon with (1) an update on the
      state of a rapidly innovating branch of clinical bioinformatics, specifically,
      the microbiome; (2) a new understanding of the microbiome changes after Roux-en-Y
      gastric bypass and weight loss; and (3) a basis for understanding further
      clinical applications of studies of the distal gut microbiome, such as in Crohn
      disease, ulcerative colitis, and infectious colitis.

TI  - Tumor necrosis factor alpha antagonist-associated psoriasis in inflammatory
      diseases: an analysis of the FDA adverse event reporting system.
PG  - 1164-72
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0b013e31828075bd [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory, relapsing, and
      progressive condition that leads to bowel damage and subsequent stricturing or
      penetrating complications. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha antagonists (e.g.,
      infliximab) can achieve sustained remission in CD. However, a paradox exists as
      to whether use of these medications, which effectively treat psoriasis, also
      confer risk of developing psoriasiform lesions. METHODS: Data from the Food and
      Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (2004-2011) were analyzed.
      Adverse event reports for the TNF-alpha antagonists infliximab, adalimumab, and
      certolizumab were reviewed. Primary "control" drugs examined included the non-CD 
      drugs propranolol and lithium because of their recognized association with risk
      of psoriasis and the nonbiological CD drug mesalamine. Proportional reporting
      ratios for psoriasis adverse events were calculated for TNF-alpha antagonists
      versus control drugs. RESULTS: From more than 13 million reports in Adverse Event
      Reporting System, the biological group included 5432 reports with psoriasis
      listed (infliximab = 1789; adalimumab = 3475; and certolizumab = 168) compared
      with just 88 psoriasis reports for the control group (propranolol = 24;
      mesalamine = 24; and lithium = 40). Compared with control drugs, the psoriasis
      proportional reporting ratios for TNF-alpha antagonists were as follows:
      infliximab (6.61), adalimumab (12.13), and certolizumab (5.43) (P < 0.0001). The 
      aggregate "class" proportional reporting ratio for all TNF-alpha antagonists
      versus control drugs was 9.24 (P < 0.0001). Similar results were observed when
      psoriasis reports were compared between TNF-alpha antagonists and other drugs
      used to treat CD, including azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate,
      corticosteroids, ciprofloxacin, and the antimalarial drug, hydroxychloroquine.
      CONCLUSIONS: Data from the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting
      System suggest that TNF-alpha antagonists used in the treatment of CD confer an
      increased risk of psoriasiform adverse events.

PG  - 787-96
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2012-302504 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics are derived from traditional fermented foods, from beneficial
      commensals or from the environment. They act through diverse mechanisms affecting
      the composition or function of the commensal microbiota and by altering host
      epithelial and immunological responses. Certain probiotic interventions have
      shown promise in selected clinical conditions where aberrant microbiota have been
      reported, such as atopic dermatitis, necrotising enterocolitis, pouchitis and
      possibly irritable bowel syndrome. However, no studies have been conducted that
      can causally link clinical improvements to probiotic-induced microbiota changes. 
      Whether a disease-prone microbiota pattern can be remodelled to a more robust,
      resilient and disease-free state by probiotic administration remains a key
      unanswered question. Progress in this area will be facilitated by: optimising
      strain, dose and product formulations, including protective commensal species;
      matching these formulations with selectively responsive subpopulations; and
      identifying ways to manipulate diet to modify bacterial profiles and metabolism.

LID - S1542-3565(13)00278-4 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Saccharomyces boulardii is a probiotic yeast that has been
      shown to have beneficial effects on the intestinal epithelial barrier and
      digestive immune system. There is preliminary evidence that S boulardii could be 
      used to treat patients with Crohn's disease (CD). We performed a randomized,
      placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the effects of S boulardii in patients with 
      CD who underwent remission during therapy with steroids or aminosalicylates.
      METHODS: We performed a prospective study of 165 patients who achieved remission 
      after treatment with steroids or salicylates; they were randomly assigned to
      groups given S boulardii (1 g/day) or placebo for 52 weeks. The primary end point
      was the percentage of patients in remission at week 52. Time to relapse, Crohn's 
      disease activity index scores, and changes in parameters of inflammation were
      secondary end points. RESULTS: CD relapsed in 80 patients, 38 in the S boulardii 
      group (47.5%) and 42 in the placebo group (53.2%, a nonsignificant difference).
      The median time to relapse did not differ significantly between patients given S 
      boulardii (40.7 weeks) vs placebo (39.0 weeks). There were no significant
      differences between groups in mean Crohn's disease activity index scores or
      erythrocyte sedimentation rates or in median levels of C-reactive protein. In a
      post hoc analysis, nonsmokers given S boulardii were less likely to experience a 
      relapse of CD than nonsmokers given placebo, but this finding requires
      confirmation. CONCLUSIONS: Although the probiotic yeast S boulardii is safe and
      well tolerated, it does not appear to have any beneficial effects for patients
      with CD in remission after steroid or salicylate therapies.

TI  - Cellulose supplementation early in life ameliorates colitis in adult mice.
PG  - e56685
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0056685 [doi]
AB  - Decreased consumption of dietary fibers, such as cellulose, has been proposed to 
      promote the emergence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD: Crohn disease [CD] and
      ulcerative colitis [UC]) where intestinal microbes are recognized to play an
      etiologic role. However, it is not known if transient fiber consumption during
      critical developmental periods may prevent consecutive intestinal inflammation.
      The incidence of IBD peaks in young adulthood indicating that pediatric
      environmental exposures may be important in the etiology of this disease group.
      We studied the effects of transient dietary cellulose supplementation on dextran 
      sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis susceptibility during the pediatric period in mice. 
      Cellulose supplementation stimulated substantial shifts in the colonic mucosal
      microbiome. Several bacterial taxa decreased in relative abundance (e.g.,
      Coriobacteriaceae [p = 0.001]), and other taxa increased in abundance (e.g.,
      Peptostreptococcaceae [p = 0.008] and Clostridiaceae [p = 0.048]). Some of these 
      shifts persisted for 10 days following the cessation of cellulose
      supplementation. The changes in the gut microbiome were associated with transient
      trophic and anticolitic effects 10 days following the cessation of a
      cellulose-enriched diet, but these changes diminished by 40 days following
      reversal to a low cellulose diet. These findings emphasize the transient
      protective effect of dietary cellulose in the mammalian large bowel and highlight
      the potential role of dietary fibers in amelioration of intestinal inflammation.

TI  - A shift from oral to intravenous iron supplementation therapy is observed over
      time in a large swiss cohort of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 840-6
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0b013e31827febbb [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2007, leading international experts in the field of inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) recommended intravenous (IV) iron supplements over oral (PO) 
      ones because of superior effectiveness and better tolerance. We aimed to
      determine the percentage of patients with IBD undergoing iron therapy and to
      assess the dynamics of iron prescription habits (IV versus PO). METHODS: We
      analyzed anonymized data on patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis 
      extracted from the Helsana database. Helsana is a Swiss health insurance company 
      providing coverage for 18% of the Swiss population (1.2 million individuals).
      RESULTS: In total, 629 patients with Crohn's disease (61% female) and 398
      patients with ulcerative colitis (57% female) were identified; mean observation
      time was 31.8 months for Crohn's disease and 31.0 months for ulcerative colitis
      patients. Of all patients with IBD, 27.1% were prescribed iron (21.1% in males;
      31.1% in females). Patients treated with steroids, immunomodulators, and/or
      anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs were more frequently treated with iron
      supplements when compared with those not treated with any medications (35.0%
      versus 20.9%, odds ratio, 1.94; P < 0.001). The frequency of IV iron
      prescriptions increased significantly from 2006 to 2009 for both genders (males: 
      from 2.6% to 10.1%, odds ratio = 3.84, P < 0.001; females: from 5.3% to 12.1%,
      odds ratio = 2.26, P = 0.002), whereas the percentage of PO iron prescriptions
      did not change. CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-seven percent of patients with IBD were
      treated with iron supplements. Iron supplements administered IV were prescribed
      more frequently over time. These prescription habits are consistent with the
      implementation of guidelines on the management of iron deficiency in IBD.

TI  - Use and predictors of oral complementary and alternative medicine by patients
      with inflammatory bowel disease: a population-based, case-control study.
PG  - 767-78
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0b013e31827f27c8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in the
      general population and in patients with chronic diseases has increased markedly
      in recent decades. We aimed to determine the prevalence, type, and predictors of 
      oral CAM use among patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) compared with
      the general population in a large, population-based, case-control study. METHODS:
      Overall, 1370 patients with IBD and 598 control subjects in Canterbury, New
      Zealand, were recruited. Environmental and phenotypic data were obtained through 
      a questionnaire and case note review. Predictors of oral CAM use were identified 
      using binary logistic regression. RESULTS: In the previous year, 44.1% of
      patients with IBD and 42.3% of control subjects used oral CAM (odds ratio [OR],
      1.078; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.885-1.312). The types of oral CAM used
      most frequently were vitamins (Crohn's disease [CD], 25.2%; ulcerative colitis,
      23.7%; control subjects, 24.9%), followed by herbs (CD 15.1%, ulcerative colitis 
      15.2%, control subjects 12.8%), and dietary supplements (CD, 8.5%; ulcerative
      colitis 12.6%, control subjects 12.1%). Female gender (OR, 1.61; 95% CI,
      1.25-2.08), younger age (P = 0.005), higher education (P = 0.002), higher income 
      (P = 0.04), being a vegetarian (OR, 3.58; 95% CI, 1.97-6.48) and a middle social 
      class at birth (P = 0.024) were independent predictors of oral CAM use in
      patients with IBD. Disease phenotype was not associated with oral CAM use. In
      control subjects, female gender (OR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.85-3.86), higher education
      (P = 0.003) and a diagnosis of asthma (P = 0.017) predicted oral CAM use.
      CONCLUSIONS: Oral CAM use is common in, and does not differ between, patients
      with IBD and the general population in Canterbury, New Zealand. Socio-demographic
      factors, and not disease phenotype, predict oral CAM use in patients with IBD.

PG  - 294-304
LID - 10.1556/OH.2013.29547 [doi]
AB  - After a short overview of the history of probiotics, the author presents the
      development of human intestinal microflora based on the newest genetic data and
      the microbiological features of main probiotics. The indications of probiotic
      administration have been defined and extended in recent years. The author reviews
      significant results of probiotic treatment in some gastrointestinal diseases
      based on meta-analytical data. Probiotics are useful in preventing and treating
      diarrhoea caused by antibiotics and Clostridium difficile caused diarrhoea. In
      the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection, preparations containing certain
      Lactobacillus,Bifidobacterium strains or Saccaromyces boulardii could enhance by 
      5-10% the rate of successful eradication and reduce the incidence and severity of
      the side effects. Some symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and thus the quality 
      of life can be improved by probiotics. Their beneficial effect in ulcerative
      colitis was proven, while in Crohn's disease has not yet been defined. The use of
      probiotics is not included in guidelines, with the exception of the Maastricht
      IV/Florence consensus. For each disease it is advisable to use probiotics
      containing strains only with proven beneficial effect. The efficiency of
      preparations containing mixed strains has not yet been properly investigated. The
      author reviews the rare but potentially serious side effects of probiotics. In
      Hungary, there are many probiotic preparations available which can be purchased
      in pharmacies without prescription: their use is more empirical than
      evidence-based. The European Food Safety Authority has recently rejected claims
      for probiotics to be classed as medicines given the lack of convincing evidence
      on the effects of probiotics on human health and well-being. Clearly, further
      research is needed to collect evidence which could be incorporated into the
      international guidelines.

LID - S1873-9946(13)00032-9 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Crohn's disease prevalence increases with increasing
      latitude. Because most vitamin D comes from sunlight exposure and murine models
      of intestinal inflammation have demonstrated beneficial effects of 1,25-(OH)2
      vitamin D treatment, we hypothesised that Crohn's disease activity is associated 
      with low vitamin D levels. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study of 182 CD patients
      and 62 healthy controls, we measured serum 25-OH vitamin D. Stratified analysis
      was used to compare 25-OH vitamin D levels with Crohn's disease activity index,
      C-reactive protein, smoking status, intake of oral vitamin D supplements and
      seasonal variation in CD patients and healthy controls. RESULTS: Serum 25-OH
      vitamin D was inversely associated with disease activity: Median 25-OH vitamin D 
      levels of Crohn's disease in remission, mildly, and moderately active diseases
      evaluated by Crohn's disease activity index were 64, 49, and 21 nmol/l (p<0.01)
      and by CRP 68, 76, and 35 nmol/l (p<0.05), respectively. Patients who took oral
      vitamin D supplementation had lower Crohn's disease activity index (p<0.05) and
      C-reactive protein (p=0.07) than non-users. Crohn's disease patients who smoked
      had lower vitamin D levels (51 nmol/l) than patients who did not smoke (76
      nmol/l), p<0.01. Overall, Crohn's disease patients did not differ from healthy
      controls regarding 25-OH vitamin D levels. CONCLUSIONS: Active Crohn's disease
      was associated with low serum 25-OH vitamin D. Patients who smoked had lower
      25-OH vitamin D levels than patients who did not smoke, independently of disease 
      activity.

AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) incidence has increased over the past fifty years but the
      explanation is unclear. CD can be brought into remission by liquid enteral
      feeding, but the mechanism for this response is unknown. We suggest that
      consumption of emulsifiers in processed foods may promote CD by increasing
      bacterial translocation. This is supported by evidence that (i) geographical
      variation in CD correlates with emulsifier consumption as does the increasing
      incidence of CD in Japan; (ii) although CD incidence also correlates with fat
      consumption, the response to enteral feeding is not affected by the fat content
      of the feed and (iii) very small concentrations of the emulsifier polysorbate 80 
      enhance bacterial translocation across intestinal epithelia. Undigested
      emulsifiers may increase bacterial translocation, particularly in the small
      intestine where the mucus layer is discontinuous. The hypothesis should be
      testable by trials of enteral feeding with/without emulsifiers.

TI  - The interplay between fiber and the intestinal microbiome in the inflammatory
      response.
PG  - 16-28
LID - 10.3945/an.112.003046 [doi]
AB  - Fiber intake is critical for optimal health. This review covers the
      anti-inflammatory roles of fibers using results from human epidemiological
      observations, clinical trials, and animal studies. Fiber has body weight-related 
      anti-inflammatory activity. With its lower energy density, a diet high in fiber
      has been linked to lower body weight, alleviating obesity-induced chronic
      inflammation evidenced by reduced amounts of inflammatory markers in human and
      animal studies. Body weight-unrelated anti-inflammatory activity of fiber has
      also been extensively studied in animal models in which the type and amount of
      fiber intake can be closely monitored. Fermentable fructose-, glucose-, and
      galactose-based fibers as well as mixed fibers have shown systemic and local
      intestinal anti-inflammatory activities when plasma inflammatory markers and
      tissue inflammation were examined. Similar anti-inflammatory activities have also
      been demonstrated in some human studies that controlled total fiber intake. The
      anti-inflammatory activities of synbiotics (probiotics plus fiber) were reviewed 
      as well, but there was no convincing evidence indicating higher efficacy of
      synbiotics compared with that of fiber alone. Adverse effects have not been
      observed with the amount of fiber intake or supplementation used in studies,
      although patients with Crohn's disease may be more sensitive to inulin intake.
      Several possible mechanisms that may mediate the body weight-unrelated
      anti-inflammatory activity of fibers are discussed based on the in vitro and in
      vivo evidence. Fermentable fibers are known to affect the intestinal microbiome. 
      The immunomodulatory role of the intestinal microbiome and/or microbial
      metabolites could contribute to the systemic and local anti-inflammatory
      activities of fibers.

TI  - Dietary intervention for oral allergy syndrome as a treatment in orofacial
      granulomatosis: a new approach?
PG  - 517-22
LID - 10.1111/jop.12041 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Orofacial granulomatosis (OFG) is a chronic granulomatous condition
      of the mouth, face and lips. Recent work demonstrates a high rate of atopy and
      silver birch sensitisation from skin prick testing (SPT). Oral allergy syndrome
      (OAS) is an acute oro-pharyngeal IgE mediated reaction, triggered by foods that
      cross react with pollens, most commonly silver birch. The aim of this study was
      to determine if patients with OFG and positive SPT to common OAS associated
      pollens responded to avoidance of cross reactive foods. METHODS: Patients with
      OFG and positive SPT to silver birch, grass, mugwort, ragweed and latex were
      required to avoid cross reacting foods, for 6 weeks and, in those who responded, 
      for a total of 12 weeks. All had standardized oral examinations and were given
      severity scores (SS) at each appointment. RESULTS: Twenty two of 47 (47%)
      patients had one or more positive SPT and 13/22 completed 6 weeks on the diet. No
      difference was seen in SS between weeks 0 (14.62 +/- 11.16) and 6 (13.31 +/-
      10.33; P = 0.656). Six of 14 (43%) had significantly improved SS (week 0; 19.17
      +/- 12.95, week 6; 10.83 +/- 4.99, P = 0.027). Five completed 12 weeks and no
      further improvement was seen (week 6; 11 +/- 5.57, week 12; 10.4 +/- 9.94; P =
      0.068). Two patients required no further treatments. CONCLUSIONS: On an intention
      to treat basis, only 2/14 patients improved and required no further intervention.
      Whilst this diet cannot be recommended routinely, the improvement seen in some
      patients raises questions about the role of OAS in patients with OFG.

TI  - Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1745-52
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2012-303611 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Many species within the phylum Firmicutes are thought to exert
      anti-inflammatory effects. We quantified bacteria belonging to the genus
      Butyricicoccus in stools of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's
      disease (CD). We evaluated the effect of Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum in a rat
      colitis model and analysed the ability to prevent cytokine-induced increases in
      epithelial permeability. DESIGN: A genus-specific quantitative PCR was used for
      quantification of Butyricicoccus in stools from patients with UC or CD and
      healthy subjects. The effect of B pullicaecorum on trinitrobenzenesulfonic
      (TNBS)-induced colitis was assessed and the effect of B pullicaecorum culture
      supernatant on epithelial barrier function was investigated in vitro. RESULTS:
      The average number of Butyricicoccus in stools from patients with UC and CD in
      active (UC: 8.61 log10/g stool; CD: 6.58 log10/g stool) and remission phase (UC: 
      8.69 log10/g stool; CD: 8.38 log10/g stool) was significantly lower compared with
      healthy subjects (9.32 log10/g stool) and correlated with disease activity in CD.
      Oral administration of B pullicaecorum resulted in a significant protective
      effect based on macroscopic and histological criteria and decreased intestinal
      myeloperoxidase (MPO), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin
      (IL)-12 levels. Supernatant of B pullicaecorum prevented the loss of
      transepithelial resistance (TER) and the increase in IL-8 secretion induced by
      TNFalpha and interferon gamma (IFN gamma) in a Caco-2 cell model. CONCLUSIONS:
      Patients with inflammatory bowel disease have lower numbers of Butyricicoccus
      bacteria in their stools. Administration of B pullicaecorum attenuates
      TNBS-induced colitis in rats and supernatant of B pullicaecorum cultures
      strengthens the epithelial barrier function by increasing the TER.

TI  - Video capsule endoscopy of the small bowel.
PG  - 133-9
LID - 10.1097/MOG.0b013e32835bdc03 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Small bowel capsule endoscopy (SBCE) was introduced 13 years
      ago by Given Imaging (Yokneam, Israel). It has become one of the most important
      investigational tools of the small bowel. The capsule is swallowed with water
      after a 12 h fast, propelled via peristalsis through the gastrointestinal tract
      and excreted naturally. A nonvideo patency capsule was developed to confirm
      functional patency of the gastrointestinal tract. RECENT FINDINGS: Four
      additional companies have introduced competitive small bowel video capsules, some
      of which are Food and Drug Admistration (FDA) approved. Due to the easiness of
      the procedure, SBCE has become a first-line tool to detect small bowel
      abnormalities. The main indications for SBCE include obscure gastrointestinal
      bleeding, suspected Crohn's disease, small bowel tumors and practically any
      abnormal small bowel imaging. New indications are emerging like small bowel
      motility and monitoring of drug therapy and mucosal healing. The present review
      will describe the available capsules in the market, the procedure itself, present
      indications and future expectations. It will focus on the PillCam SB of Given
      Imaging as it is the one on which most of the literature is written. SUMMARY:
      Over the past 10 years, SBCE has become a routine, first-line investigational
      tool of many small bowel pathologies.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic profiles for oral and subcutaneous methotrexate in patients with 
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 340-5
LID - 10.1111/apt.12161 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Methotrexate (MTX) is administered subcutaneously to Crohn's Disease 
      (CD) patients. There are very few studies evaluating the use of oral (PO) MTX in 
      CD. A drug and its pharmaceutical alternative are equivalent (bioequivalence)
      when the bioavailability of the alternative falls within 80-125% of the
      bioavailability of the standard (US Food and Drug Administration - FDA). AIM: To 
      compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of PO and subcutaneous (SC) MTX in CD
      patients to determine the bioequivalence of these two routes. METHODS: Eleven
      patients received a PO and an SC MTX dose (25 mg) separated by one week over a
      two-week interval. Blood samples were collected at specified times over a 24-h
      period for each patient on two separate days. MTX plasma levels were obtained
      using sensitive mass spectrometry. Areas under the curve (AUC) were compared
      between the two routes. RESULTS: The mean AUC values were 3375 ng/mL x h (PO MTX)
      and 3985 ng/mL x h (SC MTX). The mean AUC ratio (PO/SC) was 0.86 (0.62-1.08).
      This correlates with a relative PO bioavailability of 86% in comparison to SC.
      The 90% confidence interval for the mean AUC (PO/SC) ratio is (0.785, 0.929).
      There were no adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The mean MTX AUC (PO/SC) in these
      patients falls outside the 90% confidence interval for the bioequivalence limit. 
      SC MTX is more bioavailable than PO MTX; however, the mean relative MTX
      bioavailability (PO/SC) nearly met the FDA bioequivalence standard and PO MTX
      could be proposed in responders who would prefer this route.

TI  - Tolerability of curcumin in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease: a forced-dose
      titration study.
PG  - 277-9
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e318276977d [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by chronic
      intestinal inflammation in the absence of a recognized etiology. The primary
      therapies are medications that possess anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive
      effects. Given the high use of complementary alternative medicines in pediatric
      IBD, a prospective tolerability study of curcumin, an herbal therapy with known
      anti-inflammatory effects, was conducted to assess possible dosage in children
      with IBD. METHODS: Prospectively, patients with Crohn disease or ulcerative
      colitis in remission or with mild disease (Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity
      Index [PCDAI] <30 or Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index [PUCAI] score
      <34) were enrolled in a tolerability study. All patients received curcumin in
      addition to their standard therapy. Patients initially received 500 mg twice per 
      day for 3 weeks. Using the forced-dose titration design, doses were increased up 
      to 1 g twice per day at week 3 for a total of 3 weeks and then titrated again to 
      2 g twice per day at week 6 for 3 weeks. Validated measures of disease activity, 
      using the PUCAI and PCDAI, and the Monitoring of Side Effect System score were
      obtained at weeks 3, 6, and 9. RESULTS: All patients tolerated curcumin well,
      with the only symptom that was consistently reported during all 3 visits being an
      increase in gassiness, which occurred in only 2 patients. Three patients saw
      improvement in PUCAI/PCDAI score. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests that
      curcumin may be used as an adjunctive therapy for individuals seeking a
      combination of conventional medicine and alternative medicine.

TI  - Enteral nutrition to suppress postoperative Crohn's disease recurrence: a
      five-year prospective cohort study.
PG  - 335-40
LID - 10.1007/s00384-012-1587-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term effect of enteral
      nutrition (EN) as a maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease (CD) patients
      following surgery. METHODS: This study was an extension of our previous study to 
      prolong the duration of intervention and follow-up from 1 to 5 years. Forty
      consecutive patients who underwent resection for ileal or ileocolic CD were
      included. Following surgery, 20 patients received continuous elemental diet
      infusion during the nighttime plus a low-fat diet during the daytime (EN group). 
      Another 20 patients received neither nutritional therapy nor food restriction
      (control group). All patients were followed for 5 years after operation. No
      patient received corticosteroid, immunosuppressants, or infliximab except
      patients who developed recurrence. The end point of this study was recurrence
      requiring biologic therapy or reoperation. Recurrence rates were analyzed on an
      intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS: In the EN group, four patients could not
      continue tube intubation for elemental diet intake. Two patients (10 %) in the EN
      group and nine patients (45 %) in the control group developed recurrence
      requiring infliximab therapy (P = 0.03). The cumulative recurrence incidence rate
      requiring infliximab was significantly lower in the EN group vs the control group
      (P = 0.02). One patient (5 %) in the EN group and five patients (25 %) in the
      control group required reoperation for recurrence (P = 0.18). The cumulative
      incidence of reoperation was lower in the EN group vs the control group, the
      difference not being significant (P = 0.08). CONCLUSION: The outcomes of this
      study suggest that EN therapy reduces the incidence of postoperative CD
      recurrence.

PG  - 209-15
LID - 10.1007/s10620-012-2323-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The three Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anti-tumor
      necrosis factor drugs (anti-TNFs) for Crohn's disease (CD) have not been directly
      compared. AIM: To compare the efficacy of the three anti-TNFs for CD in clinical 
      practice. METHODS: Retrospective review of patients initiated on anti-TNF between
      2004 and 2008. Disease activity, quality of life, and remission rates were
      compared between groups over 1 year. RESULTS: Sixty patients with CD were
      initiated on anti-TNF from 2004 to 2008: 31 on infliximab (IFX) and 29 on
      adalimumab (ADA) or certolizumab pegol (CTZ). More patients in the ADA/CTZ scores
      group had prior exposure to anti-TNF (76 versus 10%, p < 0.01). Mean
      Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) scores in the IFX group were lower than in the
      ADA/CTZ group at 12 months (2.72 +/- 3.34 versus 5.63 +/- 5.33, p = 0.03). At 12 
      months, more IFX patients were in remission compared with those on ADA/CTZ (88
      versus 53%, p </= 0.01). Mean short inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire
      (SIBDQ) scores were not different between the IFX and ADA/CTZ groups at 12
      months. Stratified analyses and logistic regression based on prior anti-TNF use
      did not show differences in remission rates at any time point post-baseline
      between groups. CONCLUSIONS: After adjustment for prior anti-TNF there was no
      difference in remission rates between the IFX and ADA/CTZ groups at any time
      point post-baseline. This suggests that differences between groups were accounted
      for by a higher rate of prior anti-TNF in the ADA/CTZ group. Our results should
      be reviewed with caution given the small sample size.

TI  - Use of exclusive enteral nutrition in paediatric Crohn's disease in The
      Netherlands.

LID - S1873-9946(12)00312-1 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A six-week course of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is
      recommended as first treatment in active paediatric Crohn's disease (CD). We
      aimed to assess short-term and long-term outcome of EEN, and to identify
      predictive factors of treatment success. METHODS: The medical records of newly
      diagnosed paediatric CD patients initiating EEN as remission induction therapy
      between January 2008 and October 2011 were retrospectively studied. Treatment
      outcome was assessed using a previously described pattern recognition model.
      RESULTS: 77 CD patients (median age 13.9 years, 57% male) initiated a six-week
      course of EEN, combined with azathioprine maintenance treatment in 92%. Patients 
      received EEN as either hyperosmolar sip feeds or polymeric formula by nasogastric
      tube. In patients completing a six-week course of EEN (n=58), complete remission 
      was achieved in 71%, partial remission in 26%, and no response in 3%. Complete
      remission rates were higher in children presenting with isolated ileal/ileocaecal
      disease and malnutrition. Nineteen patients discontinued EEN before the intended 
      treatment period due to worsening of symptoms (n=9) or adherence issues (n=10).
      Non-adherence occurred more often in older children, females, children from
      non-Dutch parents, and patients taking hyperosmolar sip feeds compared with
      polymeric formula by nasogastric tube. The likelihood of relapsing disease within
      the first year after EEN treatment was 59%. CONCLUSION: A six-week course of EEN 
      is effective in newly diagnosed paediatric CD, with response rates that seem to
      be influenced by disease location and nutritional status, but not by type of
      formula. Non-adherence occurs frequently and limits the success of this treatment
      in everyday clinical practice.

AB  - IBD is a chronic and relapsing inflammatory disorder of the gut that demands
      long-lasting treatment targeting both flare-up periods and maintenance of
      remission. Oral systemic steroids have been used to induce remission in patients 
      with active IBD for over 50 years due to their potent anti-inflammatory effects. 
      The efficacy of systemic steroids in this setting has been largely demonstrated. 
      However, the wide range of adverse events associated with these drugs has
      prompted the development of equally effective but less toxic steroid compounds.
      Currently, topically acting oral steroids are an important therapeutic option for
      Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and microscopic colitis, being oral
      budesonide and oral beclomethasone established elements of the IBD armamentarium.
      At present, oral budesonide is the first-line therapy to induce remission in
      microscopic colitis and mild to moderate ileocaecal CD patients and oral
      beclomethasone is effective treating mild to moderate UC patients with left-sided
      or extensive disease. This review aims at evaluating the current role of these
      compounds in IBD clinical practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Decreased bone mineral density (BMD) is common in Crohn's
      disease (CD) patients. This paper reports on the prevalence of decreased BMD in a
      referral cohort study of CD-patients next to the change of BMD over time in
      relation with CD-associated clinical characteristics. METHODS: 205 CD patients of
      a referral hospital were enrolled between January1998-January 2010 when
      measurement of BMD by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was available. Follow-up
      DXA scan was performed in subjects with known risk factors besides Crohn
      indicative for low BMD. Treatment of CD patients was according to a protocol
      which is comparable to the current (inter)national guidelines. In osteopenic
      patients, supplemental vitamin D (800 IU) and Calcium (500-1000 mg) were
      prescribed. RESULTS: Mean BMD at baseline was 0.97 +/- 0.16 gram/cm(2) in lumbar 
      spine and 0.87 +/- 0.12 gram/cm(2) in the total hip. At baseline, higher age and 
      low Body Mass Index (BMI), were negatively correlated with BMD. Eighty-four
      patients underwent a second BMD assessment with a median interval period of 4
      years (IQR 3-6). A mean annual increase of +0.76% (95%CI: -2.63%; +3.87%) in
      lumbar spine and +0.43% (95%CI: -2.65% ; +1.11%) in total hip was observed.
      CONCLUSIONS: Higher age, male sex, low BMI, and a higher age at diagnosis of CD
      were associated with low BMD. Follow-up of BMD in CD patients showed a
      contraintuitive small increase of BMD at lumbar spine and total hip in CD
      patients only using supplemental vitamin D and calcium next to strict treatment
      of CD.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To identify environmental risk factors for developing
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children <15 years of age. METHODS: IBD
      patients and randomly selected healthy controls from a well defined geographical 
      area in Denmark were prospectively recruited in the period 1.1.2007-31.12.2009.
      Data regarding socioeconomic status, area of residence, living conditions,
      infections and diet were obtained by a questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 118 IBD
      patients (59 Crohn's disease (CD), 56 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 3 IBD
      unclassified (IBDU)) and 477 healthy controls filled out the questionnaire. The
      response rates were 91% in patients and 45% in controls, respectively. Several
      risk factors for IBD were identified: IBD in first degree relatives (IBD: OR
      (odds ratio): 6.1 (95%CI: 2.5-15.0), CD (OR: 6.8 (2.3-20.2)) and UC (OR: 6.1
      (2.3-16.0))); bedroom sharing (IBD: OR: 2.1 (1.0-4.3), CD (OR: 3.6 (1.3-9.4)));
      high sugar intake (IBD: OR: 2.5 (1.0-6.2), CD (OR: 2.9 (1.0-8.5))); prior
      admission to a hospital for gastrointestinal infections (IBD: 7.7 (3.1-19.1), CD 
      (7.9 (2.5-24.9)) and UC (7.4 (2.5-21.6))); stressful events (IBD: 1.7 (1.0-2.9)).
      Protective factors were daily vs. less than daily vegetable consumption (CD: 0.3 
      (0.1-1.0), UC (0.3 (0.1-0.8))) and whole meal bread consumption (IBD: OR: 0.5
      (0.3-0.9), CD (0.4 (0.2-0.9))). An increased risk of diagnosis of CD compared to 
      UC was shown for patients living in more urban areas (OR: 1.3 (1.1-1.6)).
      CONCLUSION: We identified several risk and protective factors for developing IBD.
      Studies on the influence of environmental factors are important in our
      understanding of aetiology and phenotypes of paediatric IBD.

TI  - The gut microbiota elicits a profound metabolic reorientation in the mouse

LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2011-301955 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Proper interactions between the intestinal mucosa, gut microbiota and 
      nutrient flow are required to establish homoeostasis of the host. Since the
      proximal part of the small intestine is the first region where these interactions
      occur, and since most of the nutrient absorption occurs in the jejunum, it is
      important to understand the dynamics of metabolic responses of the mucosa in this
      intestinal region. DESIGN: Germ-free mice aged 8-10 weeks were conventionalised
      with faecal microbiota, and responses of the jejunal mucosa to bacterial
      colonisation were followed over a 30-day time course. Combined transcriptome,
      histology, (1)H NMR metabonomics and microbiota phylogenetic profiling analyses
      were used. RESULTS: The jejunal mucosa showed a two-phase response to the
      colonising microbiota. The acute-phase response, which had already started 1 day 
      after conventionalisation, involved repression of the cell cycle and parts of the
      basal metabolism. The secondary-phase response, which was consolidated during
      conventionalisation (days 4-30), was characterised by a metabolic shift from an
      oxidative energy supply to anabolic metabolism, as inferred from the tissue
      transcriptome and metabonome changes. Detailed transcriptome analysis identified 
      tissue transcriptional signatures for the dynamic control of the metabolic
      reorientation in the jejunum. The molecular components identified in the response
      signatures have known roles in human metabolic disorders, including insulin
      sensitivity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSION: This study elucidates the
      dynamic jejunal response to the microbiota and supports a prominent role for the 
      jejunum in metabolic control, including glucose and energy homoeostasis. The
      molecular signatures of this process may help to find risk markers in the
      declining insulin sensitivity seen in human type 2 diabetes mellitus, for
      instance.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel disease, a chronic inflammation of the
      intestinal tract, presents in two variations, Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn's
      disease (CD). Given that treatment of CD differs from UC, a single test that
      provided strong diagnostic ability would offer great clinical value. Two previous
      studies have indicated that CD can be distinguished from UC, and that both can be
      distinguished from non-IBD-type gastrointestinal disease, based on urinary and
      faecal metabolite profiling. METHODS: Analysis of healthy as well as CD and UC
      patients attending an IBD clinic was performed. IBD patients were classified into
      two groups (CD or UC) based on chart review of clinical, endoscopic, and
      histological assessment. Urine samples were obtained and analyzed using nuclear
      magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy combined with targeted profiling
      techniques, followed by univariate and multivariate statistical analysis.
      RESULTS: Based on urinary metabolomics, individuals with IBD could be
      differentiated from healthy. Major differences between IBD and healthy included
      TCA cycle intermediates, amino acids, and gut microflora metabolites. Comparison 
      of CD and UC patients revealed discrimination, but removal of patients with the
      surgical intervention confounder revealed that CD could not be discriminated from
      UC. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the potential for metabolomics to
      distinguish IBD from the healthy state but shows that careful consideration must 
      be given to establishing disease-representative cohorts that are free of
      confounding factors.
