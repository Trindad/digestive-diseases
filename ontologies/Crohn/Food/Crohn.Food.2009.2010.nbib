TI  - Aberrant response to commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron in Crohn's disease:
      an ex vivo human organ culture study.
PG  - 1201-8
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21501 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human ex vivo evidence indicating that an inappropriate immune
      response(s) to nonpathogenic bacteria contributes to disease pathogenesis in
      pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) is limited. The aim of the present study was to
      compare and contrast the early innate immune response of pediatric "healthy"
      versus CD mucosa to pathogenic, probiotic, and commensal bacteria. METHODS:
      "Healthy control" and CD pediatric mucosal biopsies (terminal ileum and
      transverse colon) were cocultured for 8 hours with E. coli O42, Lactobacillus GG 
      (LGG), Bacteroidesthetaiotaomicron (B. theta), or stimulated with interleukin
      (IL)-1beta (positive control). Matched nonstimulated biopsies served as
      experimental controls. IL-8 was the immune marker of choice. IL-8 mRNA and
      protein levels were quantified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and
      sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. RESULTS: IL-8 secretion
      was observed when control, ileal biopsies were exposed to pathogenic O42 and
      probiotic LGG, with no response noted to commensal B. theta. In comparison,
      Crohn's ileal biopsies showed impaired ability to induce IL-8 in response to O42 
      and LGG. Control colonic tissue showed a limited response to O42 or B. theta and 
      LGG significantly reduced IL-8 secretion. Unlike control tissue, however, Crohn's
      ileal and colonic tissue did respond to B. theta, with more enhanced expression
      in the colon. CONCLUSIONS: We provide the first ex vivo data to support the
      notion that aberrant mucosal recognition of commensal bacteria may contribute to 
      pediatric CD. While IL-8 responses to O42 and LGG varied with disease status and 
      anatomical location, B. theta consistently induced significant IL-8 both in ileal
      and colonic CD tissue, which was not seen in control, healthy tissue.

TI  - Practice patterns in the use of anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha agents in the
      management of Crohn's disease: a US national practice survey comparing experts
      and non-experts.
PG  - 1160-4
LID - 10.1007/s10620-010-1530-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The US Food and Drug Administration currently approves three types of
      anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFalpha) therapy for treatment of
      moderate to severe Crohn's disease. There are no guidelines to clarify which of
      the drugs may be better suited to individual clinical scenarios. AIMS: We
      gathered national data on the prescribing pattern, comfort levels, and algorithms
      gastroenterologists use for management of their biologic-requiring Crohn's
      disease patients. METHODS: An internet survey was mailed to members of the
      American Gastroenterology Association. Responses were separated into "non-expert"
      and "expert" physician groups on the basis of whether a practice consisted of
      >50% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. We compared experts with
      non-experts with regard to the use of the three anti-TNF agents, attitudes
      regarding their relative efficacy, and their experience with adverse events.
      RESULTS: Of 3,990 eligible gastroenterologists, 473 replied in full (11.9%).
      Sixty (12.6%) respondents met the criterion for IBD expert physician. Experts
      were comfortable using both immunomodulators and anti-TNFalpha therapy. Community
      physicians were equally comfortable prescribing 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine,
      infliximab, and adalimumab, but less comfortable than experts with methotrexate
      (56 vs. 86%, P<0.05) and certolizumab (68 vs. 89%, P<0.05). Expert physicians
      were much more likely to have encountered adverse reactions to anti-TNFalpha
      therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that experts are more comfortable using
      a broader array of medical therapy than non-expert physicians. Although both
      groups had similar concerns regarding side-effects of anti-TNFalpha therapy,
      expert physicians were much more likely to have managed a broad range of
      complications in their patient population.

TI  - Prevalence of anaemia in inflammatory bowel disease in Switzerland: a
      cross-sectional study in patients from private practices and university
      hospitals.
PG  - 642-8
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2010.07.008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anaemia represents a common complication of inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). Most studies on anaemia in IBD patients have been performed in
      tertiary referral centres (RC) and data from gastroenterologic practices (GP) are
      lacking. We investigated the frequency and severity of anaemia in IBD patients
      from tertiary referral centres and gastroenterologic practices compared to the
      general population. METHODS: Data were acquired from patients included in the
      Swiss IBD Cohort Study. IBD activity was evaluated by CDAI and modified Truelove 
      and Witts severity index (MTWSI). Anaemia was defined as haemoglobin </=120g/L in
      women and </=130g/L in men. RESULTS: 125 patients from RC (66 with Crohn's
      disease (CD) and 59 with ulcerative colitis (UC)) and 116 patients from GP (71 CD
      and 45 UC) were included and compared to 6074 blood donors. Anaemia was found in 
      21.2% (51/241) of the IBD patients and more frequently in patients from RC as
      compared to GP and healthy controls (28.8% vs. 12.9% vs. 3.4%; P<0.01). IBD
      patients from RC suffered more frequently from active disease compared to IBD
      patients in GP (36% vs. 23%, P=0.032). Supplementation therapy (iron, vitamin
      B12, folic acid) was performed in 40% of anaemic IBD patients in GP as compared
      to 43% in RC. CONCLUSIONS: Anaemia is a common complication in patients with IBD 
      and significantly more prevalent in patients from referral centres as compared to
      patients from gastroenterologic practices. Physicians treating IBD patients
      should pay attention to the presence of anaemia and ensure sufficient
      supplementation therapy.

TI  - Probiotics and prebiotics in pediatrics.
PG  - 1217-31
LID - 10.1542/peds.2010-2548 [doi]
AB  - This clinical report reviews the currently known health benefits of probiotic and
      prebiotic products, including those added to commercially available infant
      formula and other food products for use in children. Probiotics are supplements
      or foods that contain viable microorganisms that cause alterations of the
      microflora of the host. Use of probiotics has been shown to be modestly effective
      in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in (1) treating acute viral gastroenteritis 
      in healthy children; and (2) preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea in healthy
      children. There is some evidence that probiotics prevent necrotizing
      enterocolitis in very low birth weight infants (birth weight between 1000 and
      1500 g), but more studies are needed. The results of RCTs in which probiotics
      were used to treat childhood Helicobacter pylori gastritis, irritable bowel
      syndrome, chronic ulcerative colitis, and infantile colic, as well as in
      preventing childhood atopy, although encouraging, are preliminary and require
      further confirmation. Probiotics have not been proven to be beneficial in
      treating or preventing human cancers or in treating children with Crohn disease. 
      There are also safety concerns with the use of probiotics in infants and children
      who are immunocompromised, chronically debilitated, or seriously ill with
      indwelling medical devices. Prebiotics are supplements or foods that contain a
      nondigestible food ingredient that selectively stimulates the favorable growth
      and/or activity of indigenous probiotic bacteria. Human milk contains substantial
      quantities of prebiotics. There is a paucity of RCTs examining prebiotics in
      children, although there may be some long-term benefit of prebiotics for the
      prevention of atopic eczema and common infections in healthy infants.
      Confirmatory well-designed clinical research studies are necessary.

TI  - Vitamin D supplementation in adults - guidelines.
PG  - 723-9
AB  - Vitamin D is necessary in maintaining appropriate calcium and phosphate
      homeostasis in the body (classical function) and ensuring appropriate functioning
      of many tissues, organs and cells, unrelated to mineral economy (non-classical
      function). Vitamin D deficiency in adults may cause osteomalacia, increase
      fracture risk in osteoporosis, induce cardiovascular diseases, diabetes type 1
      and 2, multiple sclerosis, Lesniowski-Crohn disease, and cancer, including colon,
      breast, and prostate cancer. Possible causes of vitamin D deficiency in a healthy
      population include decreased cutaneous synthesis and an inadequate intake of
      vitamin D, both in food and in supplements. Vitamin D deficiency level (25(OH) D.
      < 20 ng/mL), is fairly widespread, being found in a substantial percentage of
      healthy subjects around the world, regardless of race, gender and age. Daily
      vitamin D dose, as determined by the Food and Nutrition Board in 1997, is now
      rather insufficient, the biggest problem being associated with maximal vitamin D 
      levels (50 mug/day) in actually available food supplements. Nowadays, it is
      recommended that adults need a minimum of 800-1,000 U/day when their exposure to 
      the sun is inadequate (in Poland from October to April). This dosage should be
      provided to all subjects who avoid sunlight, as well as to those aged over 65
      because of their slower skin synthesis of vitamin D and for its proven
      anti-fracture and anti-fall effects.

AB  - Normal functioning of the human body requires a balance between nutritional
      intake and metabolism, and imbalances manifest as nutritional deficiencies or
      excess. Nutritional deficiency states are associated with social factors (war,
      poverty, famine, and food fads), medical illnesses with malabsorption (such as
      Crohn disease, cystic fibrosis, and after bariatric surgery), psychiatric
      illnesses (eating disorders, autism, alcoholism), and medications. Nutritional
      excess states result from inadvertent or intentional excessive intake. Cutaneous 
      manifestations of nutritional imbalance can herald other systemic manifestations.
      This contribution discusses nutritional deficiency and excess syndromes with
      cutaneous manifestations of particular interest to clinical dermatologists.

TI  - Epidemiologic clues to inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 495-501
LID - 10.1007/s11894-010-0144-x [doi]
AB  - In this article, the recent literature exploring the epidemiology of inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) is reviewed. Epidemiologic studies present data on disease
      burden, but may also provide clues to disease etiology. The emergence of IBD in
      developing nations warrants a systematic search for environmental changes in
      those countries to explain the evolution of IBD. The hygiene hypothesis suggests 
      that an alteration in the microbial environment experienced by the host
      facilitates the evolution of chronic immune-mediated diseases. One complex
      database study suggested that areas with high species richness of human
      intestinal helminthes are areas with genetic changes in interleukin gene loci. In
      other words, over the years, the microbial ecology has affected human genetics,
      which in turn would have an impact on immune responses. Other factors affect the 
      gut microbiome, and several studies have explored the increase in incidence of
      IBD in relation to such factors as exogenous infections, use of antibiotics, and 
      diet.

TI  - Probiotic and prebiotic use in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a
      case-control study.
PG  - 2099-108
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21286 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of complementary and alternative medicine in inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) has been extensively studied. However, the use of probiotics 
      and prebiotics is poorly documented, despite evidence of efficacy of particular
      probiotic strains in specific forms of IBD. METHODS: A case-control study
      comprising interviewer-administered questionnaires was conducted in IBD patients 
      and healthy controls. Data regarding use and knowledge of probiotics and
      prebiotics, demographic, and clinical information were collected. RESULTS: In
      total, 334 participants (234 IBD, 100 controls) were interviewed. Significantly
      more IBD patients than controls had ever used probiotics to manage their health
      (Crohn's disease [CD] 43%, ulcerative colitis [UC] 51%, controls 21%, P < 0.001).
      Prebiotic use was negligible. On logistic regression analysis, having UC (odds
      ratio [OR] 4.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.27-8.12) or CD (OR 3.05, 95% CI
      1.66-5.60) were the strongest predictors of probiotic use. Within IBD patients
      the strongest predictor of probiotic use was current steroid use (OR 2.4, 95% CI 
      1.11-5.18). IBD patients had greater probiotic knowledge scores than controls (P 
      = 0.003), although 20% of IBD probiotic users could not provide a definition of a
      probiotic. Less than half of IBD probiotic users discussed probiotic use with
      healthcare professionals, with commercial advertising being the primary source of
      information. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD use probiotics to manage their health
      but frequently choose strains without evidence of efficacy in IBD. Patients rely 
      on nonclinical sources of information and often do not disclose probiotic use to 
      healthcare professionals. Conventional healthcare providers should inquire about 
      probiotic use among their patients and offer evidence-based advice.

TI  - Translocation of Crohn's disease Escherichia coli across M-cells: contrasting
      effects of soluble plant fibres and emulsifiers.
PG  - 1331-9
LID - 10.1136/gut.2009.195370 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is common in developed nations where the typical diet
      is low in fibre and high in processed food. Primary lesions overlie Peyer's
      patches and colonic lymphoid follicles where bacterial invasion through M-cells
      occurs. We have assessed the effect of soluble non-starch polysaccharide (NSP)
      and food emulsifiers on translocation of Escherichia coli across M-cells.
      METHODS: To assess effects of soluble plant fibres and food emulsifiers on
      translocation of mucosa-associated E coli isolates from Crohn's disease patients 
      and from non-Crohn's controls, we used M-cell monolayers, generated by co-culture
      of Caco2-cl1 and Raji B cells, and human Peyer's patches mounted in Ussing
      chambers. RESULTS: E coli translocation increased across M-cells compared to
      parent Caco2-cl1 monocultures; 15.8-fold (IQR 6.2-32.0) for Crohn's disease E
      coli (N=8) and 6.7-fold (IQR 3.7-21.0) for control isolates (N=5). Electron
      microscopy confirmed E coli within M-cells. Plantain and broccoli NSP markedly
      reduced E coli translocation across M-cells at 5 mg/ml (range 45.3-82.6%
      inhibition, p<0.01); apple and leek NSP had no significant effect.
      Polysorbate-80, 0.01% vol/vol, increased E coli translocation through Caco2-cl1
      monolayers 59-fold (p<0.05) and, at higher concentrations, increased
      translocation across M-cells. Similarly, E coli translocation across human
      Peyer's patches was reduced 45+/-7% by soluble plantain NSP (5 mg/ml) and
      increased 2-fold by polysorbate-80 (0.1% vol/vol). CONCLUSIONS: Translocation of 
      E coli across M-cells is reduced by soluble plant fibres, particularly plantain
      and broccoli, but increased by the emulsifier Polysorbate-80. These effects occur
      at relevant concentrations and may contribute to the impact of dietary factors on
      Crohn's disease pathogenesis.

PG  - 872-83

AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is an inflammatory illness in which the immune
      response against gut microorganisms is believed to drive an abnormal immune
      response. Consequently, modification of mucosal bacterial communities, and the
      immune effects they elicit, might be used to modify the disease state. AIM: To
      investigate the effects of synbiotic consumption on disease processes in patients
      with Crohn's disease. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled
      trial was conducted involving 35 patients with active Crohn's disease, using a
      synbiotic comprising Bifidobacterium longum and Synergy 1. Clinical status was
      scored and rectal biopsies were collected at the start, and at 3- and 6-month
      intervals. Transcription levels of immune markers and mucosal bacterial 16S rRNA 
      gene copy numbers were quantified using real-time PCR. RESULTS: Significant
      improvements in clinical outcomes occurred with synbiotic consumption, with
      reductions in both Crohn's disease activity indices (P = 0.020) and histological 
      scores (P = 0.018). The synbiotic had little effect on mucosal IL-18, INF-gamma
      and IL-1beta; however, significant reductions occurred in TNF-alpha expression in
      synbiotic patients at 3 months (P = 0.041), although not at 6 months. Mucosal
      bifidobacteria proliferated in synbiotic patients. CONCLUSION: Synbiotic
      consumption was effective in improving clinical symptoms in patients with active 
      Crohn's disease.

TI  - A microbe-dependent viral key to Crohn's box.
PG  - 43ps39
LID - 10.1126/scitranslmed.3001422 [doi]
AB  - Once Pandora unlocked her fateful box and liberated the evil forces within, it
      became impossible to put them back. Now, new work on Crohn's disease suggests the
      existence of a viral "key" that irreversibly renders a genetically susceptible
      mouse prone to pathogenesis. Indeed, dangerous liaisons among host genotype,
      viral infection, intestinal injury, and trillions of gut microbes may in part
      determine which individuals progress to a full-blown disease state. These
      findings suggest that viral and bacterial triggers may serve as therapeutic
      targets for Crohn's and prompt new hypotheses that relate inflammation, host
      immune status, microbial community structure, and human health.

TI  - Fat intake interacts with polymorphisms of Caspase9, FasLigand and PPARgamma
      apoptotic genes in modulating Crohn's disease activity.
PG  - 819-23
LID - 10.1016/j.clnu.2010.06.008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Crohn's disease (CD) is a multifactorial disease where
      resistance to apoptosis is one major defect. Also, dietary fat intake has been
      shown to modulate disease activity. We aimed to explore the interaction between
      four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in apoptotic genes and dietary fat
      intake in modulating disease activity in CD patients. METHODS: Polymerase Chain
      Reaction (PCR) and Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) techniques
      were used to analyze Caspase9+93C/T, FasLigand-843C/T, Peroxisome
      Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma+161C/T and Peroxisome
      Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma Pro12Ala SNPs in 99 patients with CD and
      116 healthy controls. Interactions between SNPs and fat intake in modulating
      disease activity were analyzed using regression analysis. RESULTS: None of the
      polymorphisms analyzed influenced disease susceptibility and/or activity, but a
      high intake of total, saturated and monounsaturated fats and a higher ratio of
      n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids(PUFA), was associated with a more active
      phenotype (p < 0.05). We observed that the detrimental effect of a high intake of
      total and trans fat was more marked in wild type carriers of the Caspase9+93C/T
      polymorphism [O.R(95%CI) 4.64(1.27-16.89) and O.R(95%CI) 4.84(1.34-17.50)]. In
      the Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma Pro12Ala SNP, we also
      observed that a high intake of saturated and monounsaturated fat was associated
      to a more active disease in wild type carriers [OR(95%CI) 4.21(1.33-13.26) and
      4.37(1.52-12.51)]. Finally, a high intake of n-6 PUFA was associated with a more 
      active disease in wild type carriers for the FasLigand-843C/T polymorphism
      [O.R(95%CI) 5.15(1.07-24.74)]. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first
      study to disclose a synergism between fat intake and SNPs in apoptotic genes in
      modulating disease activity in CD patients.

AB  - AIM: Exclusion diets have been shown to prolong remission in Crohn's disease
      (CD). We assessed IgG4-targeted exclusion diets in patients with CD. METHOD:
      Forty patients with symptomatic CD were recruited. Their sera were tested for
      IgG4 antibodies to 14 specific food antigens and each subject's four most
      reactive foods were excluded for 4 weeks. Disease activity was assessed using a
      modified CD activity index (mCDAI). Questionnaire and inflammatory markers were
      measured before and on completion of the exclusion diet. RESULTS: Eleven patients
      did not complete the study, leaving 29 for analysis. Of these, 26 (90%) reported 
      symptomatic improvement with a reduction in mCDAI from a mean of 171-97.5 (P =
      0.0001). The ESR fell from 23 to 17 mm/h (P = 0.021) and the IgG4 titres for the 
      excluded foods fell from a mean of 3015-2306 mcgA/l (P = 0.003). CONCLUSION:
      IgG4-guided exclusion diets resulted in significant symptomatic improvement with 
      an objective fall in an inflammatory marker. This approach may be useful in
      clinical practice.

      disease.
PG  - S134-7

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease
      with relapse and remission. CD patients are admitted to hospital when bowel
      inflammation flares up severely, which lowers their quality of life. Enteral
      nutrition (EN) with an elemental diet plays an important role in the treatment
      for CD patients in Japan, because of its few adverse effects, and it is thought
      to be effective in maintaining remission. We investigated the effectiveness of EN
      with an elemental diet with regard to the avoidance of hospitalization. METHODS: 
      A total of 268 patients with CD who visited hospital from 2003-2008 were
      enrolled. The relationship between the caloric content of an elemental diet and
      hospitalization as an end-point was examined retrospectively using Cox regression
      analysis. Cumulative non-hospitalization rates were calculated by the
      Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Of the 268 patients, 155 received an elemental diet
      providing 900 kcal/day or more. Among 237 patients with ileal involvement, 135
      patients receiving an elemental diet providing 900 kcal/day or more showed a
      statistically significant improvement in cumulative non-hospitalization rate.
      Among 31 patients without ileal involvement, in contrast, the cumulative
      non-hospitalization rate did not differ among those receiving an elemental diet
      of less or more than 900 kcal/day. CONCLUSION: The use of an elemental diet of
      900 kcal/day may be effective in avoiding hospitalization in CD patients with
      ileal lesions. This diet may be useful in improving the long-term convalescence
      of these patients.

TI  - Therapeutical use of probiotic formulations in clinical practice.
PG  - 701-25
LID - 10.1016/j.clnu.2010.05.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The spreading of gastrointestinal diseases is growing all over
      the world. Although for some of them an effective therapeutic approach has been
      found, palliation rather than cure is very frequent due to a partial knowledge of
      their aetiology and pathogenesis. This review, analyzing the main clinical
      studies, aims at being a state of the art update of the use of probiotic
      formulations in daily practice. METHODS: In this review we include all the most
      significant clinical trials involving the use of probiotic formulations for the
      treatment of several pathologies. RESULTS: Dysbiosis has been observed in
      irritable bowel syndrome patients. Probiotics may exert a beneficial effect on
      Crohn's disease affected patients who have shown gut microbiota antigens and
      altered wall permeability. Moreover some probiotic formulations seem to enhance
      the therapy for Helicobacter Pylori reducing its pathogenic potential. Intestinal
      ecology imbalance has been also linked to cancer induction, allergy, skin and
      urogenital diseases. In addition probiotics administration seems to be
      particularly useful to ease post-operative complications. CONCLUSION: Further
      future clinical trials, involving large numbers of patients, will be mandatory to
      achieve definite evidence of the preventive and curative role of probiotics in
      medical practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin D has immune-regulatory functions in experimental colitis,
      and low vitamin D levels are present in Crohn's disease. AIM: To assess the
      effectiveness of vitamin D3 treatment in Crohn's disease with regard to improved 
      disease course. METHODS: We performed a randomized double-blind
      placebo-controlled trial to assess the benefits of oral vitamin D3 treatment in
      Crohn's disease. We included 108 patients with Crohn's disease in remission, of
      which fourteen were excluded later. Patients were randomized to receive either
      1200 IU vitamin D3 (n = 46) or placebo (n = 48) once daily during 12 months. The 
      primary endpoint was clinical relapse. RESULTS: Oral vitamin D3 treatment with
      1200 IU daily increased serum 25OHD from mean 69 nmol/L [standard deviation
      (s.d.) 31 nmol/L] to mean 96 nmol/L (s.d. 27 nmol/L) after 3 months (P < 0.001). 
      The relapse rate was lower among patients treated with vitamin D3 (6/46 or 13%)
      than among patients treated with placebo (14/48 or 29%), (P = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS:
      Oral supplementation with 1200 IE vitamin D3 significantly increased serum
      vitamin D levels and insignificantly reduced the risk of relapse from 29% to 13%,
      (P = 0.06). Given that vitamin D3 treatment might be effective in Crohn's
      disease, we suggest larger studies to elucidate this matter further.

TI  - Anti-TNF therapy in inflammatory bowel diseases: a huge review.
PG  - 233-43
AB  - Anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) agents have changed the way of treating
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) refractory to conventional medications
      (corticosteroids, immu-nomodulators). Infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab
      are more effective than placebo for induction and maintenance of remission in
      luminal Crohn's disease. Infliximab and adalimumab are also effective for
      maintenance of fistula closure in Crohn's disease. Only infliximab is Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for ulcerative colitis. Only adalimumab has
      demonstrated its efficacy in a randomized controlled trial to induce remission
      after infliximab failure in Crohn's disease. Anti-TNF therapy leads to mucosal
      healing, reduces hospitalizations and surgeries, and improves patients' quality
      of life. Safety data indicate that serious infections occur in 2-4% of patients
      treated with anti-TNF therapy, with no statistical difference when compared to
      controls. The risk of rare events such as malignancies and lymphoma, in IBD
      patients treated with anti-TNF agents, will require a longer duration of
      follow-up. Currently, the risk-benefit ratio of anti-TNF therapy supports its use
      in IBD. Several questions remain to be answered: can an indiscriminate use of
      anti-TNF agents modify the natural course of the disease, should mucosal healing 
      be used in clinical practice, and should anti-TNF therapy be used alone or in
      combination with immunomodulators in the long-term?

TI  - Crohn's disease and ruminant farming. Got lactase?
PG  - 7-13
LID - 10.1016/j.mehy.2009.02.048 [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) is a well known chronic pathological condition whose
      aetiology has remained unrecognized for nearly a century. Complex immune
      mechanisms in a specific genetic background causing an abnormal local
      inflammatory response are thought to be directly responsible for the clinical
      picture, but no external factor triggering such host responses has been
      identified. Humans lose the capability of breaking down milk lactose early in
      life and, afterwards, ingestion of large amounts of lactose causes a transient
      digestive illness known as lactose intolerance. Some human populations developed 
      mutations for lactase persistence in adulthood that allowed better exploiting a
      product, milk, from not food-competitive domesticated species. This adaptation to
      dairy farming could have had as a collateral effect the exposure of human
      populations to a ruminant parasite with the ability to cause chronic inflammation
      in the intestine. Humans with a genetic susceptibility might develop a similar
      inflammatory disease caused by a defect in a highly conserved innate immunity
      mechanism. Data from different published sources regarding by country CD and type
      I diabetes incidence, lactose intolerance, livestock population, food production,
      Gross National Income and human population were submitted to Pearson and Kendall 
      correlation, multiple regression and principal components analyses. Multiple
      regressions were also applied to a published 20-year time series for CD incidence
      in Japan. These analyses showed a strong association between country incidence of
      CD and frequency of lactase persistence as well as other ruminant production and 
      consumption variables that further supports the meaning of those observations.
      Association of these variables with higher per capita income suggests that IBD
      incidence would be a side-effect of an otherwise highly successful adaptation.
      The evolutionarily plausible framework provided by this association with the
      species suffering a similar inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), its coincidence
      with the expanse of a cattle breed that could act as a Trojan horse, in addition 
      to recent microbiological, immunological and therapeutical observations
      consistent with a slow infection type of pathogenesis, supports a mycobacterial
      aetiology of human IBD. Further research challenging the hypothesis of a shared
      aetiology by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis of human and ruminant
      IBD by increasing research on the pathogenesis of the latter and focusing on
      effective specific antibiotic or immune aetiological therapies seems to be the
      obvious next step. Either confirmation or rejection of the hypothesis presented
      here should create new knowledge that will bring closer the eradication of a
      cause of human and animal suffering.

TI  - [Chronic inflammatory bowel disease: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis].
PG  - 1-9
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases comprise Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and
      indeterminate colitis, generally beginning in young subjects and increasing in
      frequency in Western countries. Despite their still unknown aetiologies, some
      pathogenic mechanisms have been elucidated after the recent discovery of numerous
      susceptibility genes and rare environmental factors. These diseases have a course
      consisting of episodes of flare-up alternating with periods of remission. Medical
      treatment for induction of a remission comprises besides aminosalicylates,
      corticosteroids including budesonide and immunosuppressive drugs, anti-TNF-alpha 
      drugs (infliximab, adalimumab) indicated in case of failure of previous
      therapies. Surgery is indicated for complications and failure of medical
      treatment.With current therapy, most of the patients are able to fulfil their
      familial, social and professional projects.

TI  - Update on the role of probiotics in the therapy of pediatric inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 47-54
AB  - Probiotics have had many applications in the past few years, and inflammatory
      conditions of the GI tract--including chronic disorders such as inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD)--have received the most attention by investigators. In fact, 
      the experimental basis to expect clinical efficacy of probiotics in IBD is quite 
      robust. In spite of this however, only minimal evidence of benefit by any
      probiotic is currently available in Crohn's disease, either in adult or in
      pediatric populations. In ulcerative colitis, on the other hand, several
      probiotic formulations and especially the proprietary preparation VSL#3 (a
      high-concentration mixture) have been found effective as adjuvant therapy, both
      in inducing and maintaining remission.

      disease?
PG  - 191-215
LID - 10.1586/egh.10.11 [doi]
AB  - Prescription drugs and surgery are two common medical therapies for Crohn's
      disease (CD), an inflammatory bowel disease that affects the GI tract.
      Unfortunately, certain drugs can cause serious side effects, and surgeries must
      often be repeated. No diet has been established to alleviate the pain and
      suffering of CD patients. This is curious given the fact that a higher prevalence
      of food sensitivities exist in this population of patients, and enteral nutrition
      is not only the first-line of therapy in Japan, but a known research method used 
      to place the majority of CD patients into remission. Although not all patients
      respond equally to diet, many simply remove symptom-provoking foods, such as
      dairy, wheat, corn and certain fruits and vegetables. We suggest assisting these 
      patients in their self-assessment of irritating and symptom-provoking foods by
      educating them in the use of a food-symptom diary followed by a customized
      elimination diet trialed for 2-4 weeks to determine if there is any benefit to
      the individual patient.

TI  - Mucosal flora in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis - an overview.
PG  - 61-71
AB  - The intestinal flora harbors varies pathogens. Clostridium perfringens (gas
      gangrene), Enterococci (endocarditis), Enterobacteriaceae (sepsis), Bacteroides
      (abscesses) are present in the large intestine of every healthy person in high
      concentrations. These bacteria are, however, separated from the colonic wall by
      an impenetrable mucus layer and are tolerated by the host. This separation is
      disturbed in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), where bacteria
      adhere to the mucosa and invade epithelial cells with concomitant inflammatory
      response. This chronic bowel inflammation can not subside as long as the mucus
      barrier remains defective. The inflammatory response interferes with the state of
      tolerance to the intestinal bacteria and leads to characteristic changes in the
      biostructure of the faecal microbiota. These changes in the biostructure of
      faecal microbiota are specific for active Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis 
      (UC) and can be longitudinally monitored. The reason for the defect of the mucus 
      barrier in IBD patients is unclear. Epidemiologic studies indicate a negative
      role of western lifestyle and foods and document the rise in the incidence of IBD
      in the industrialized countries during the 20(th) century. In parallel to this,
      detergents were introduced in households and emulsifiers were increasingly added 
      to food. The cleaning effect of these on the colonic mucus has to be
      investigated. The present contribution summarizes new data on the biostructure of
      the intestinal microbiota.

TI  - Vitamin D-mediated calcium absorption in patients with clinically stable Crohn's 
      disease: a pilot study.
PG  - 1085-91
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.200900351 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin D is the critical hormone for intestinal absorption of calcium. Optimal
      calcium absorption is important for proper mineralization of bone in the
      prevention of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures, among other important
      functions. Diseases associated with gut inflammation, such as Crohn's disease
      (CD), may impair calcium absorption. This pilot study evaluated vitamin D-
      dependent calcium absorption in subjects with CD. Male subjects with CD (n=4) and
      healthy age-matched controls (n=5) were studied. All subjects had fractional
      calcium absorption (FCA; by the dual calcium isotope method), serum
      25-hydroxyvitamin D, serum calcium and 24 h urinary calcium excretion
      measurements at baseline. The FCA in response to vitamin D therapy was
      re-assessed following administration of oral calcitriol 0.25 mcg twice daily for 
      1 wk, followed by oral calcitriol 0.50 mcg twice daily for 1 wk. Serum calcium
      and 24 h urinary calcium determinations were re-assessed after each increasing
      dose of calcitriol as safety measures. There was no significant difference in
      calcium FCA at baseline or after increasing doses of calcitriol between the CD
      and controls. FCA in the control and CD group was approximately 35% at baseline, 
      which increased to 60% after calcitriol therapy. No subject developed
      hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria. Our results suggest that CD patients have a
      normal response to vitamin D in enhancing the efficacy of calcium absorption.
      This suggests that stable CD patients can follow calcium and vitamin D guidelines
      of non-CD adults. Other factors independent of vitamin D status may impair
      intestinal calcium absorption in CD, including the degree and location of
      inflammation, presence of surgical resection and/or use of glucocorticoids.

      disease.
PG  - 1696-707
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21251 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are considered important
      pharmaconutrients for modulating mucosal immunity and therapeutic responses in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We investigated the influence of 
      diet therapy involving the use of an "n-3 PUFA food exchange table" (n-3DP) on
      the fatty acid composition of the erythrocyte membranes of IBD patients and its
      remission-maintaining effects. METHODS: We analyzed the fatty acid composition of
      the erythrocyte membrane before and after n-3DP intervention in 20 initial-onset 
      IBD patients who had not undergone any dietary intervention. We then analyzed it 
      again and evaluated disease activity after 12-18 months intervention in 230 IBD
      patients (168 ulcerative colitis, 62 Crohn's disease; follow-up group) in whom
      n-3DP was introduced after remission had been achieved. The follow-up group was
      divided into remission and relapse groups. RESULTS: In the 20 initial-onset
      patients, the mean n-3/n-6 ratio significantly increased after intervention (0.41
      +/- 0.16 versus 0.70 +/- 0.20; P < 0.001). In the follow-up group the ratio in
      the remission group (n = 145) was significantly higher than that in the relapse
      group (n = 85) (0.65 +/- 0.28 versus 0.53 +/- 0.18; P < 0.001). The ratio
      significantly decreased in those who suffered a relapse after the beginning of
      treatment (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: N-3DP significantly increased the erythrocyte 
      membrane n-3/n-6 ratio in IBD patients, and this ratio was significantly higher
      in the remission group, suggesting that n-3DP alters the fatty acid composition
      of the cell membrane and influences clinical activity in IBD patients.

TI  - Effect of exclusion diet with nutraceutical therapy in juvenile Crohn's disease.
PG  - 277-85
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most moderate-severe juvenile Crohn's disease (CD) patients are in a 
      constant catabolic state resulting in poor weight gain and growth failure.
      Anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and monoclonal antibody drugs, as well as
      growth hormone (GH), frequently fail to achieve sustained remission or reverse
      growth failure. OBJECTIVE: To test whether an exclusion diet with nutraceutical
      therapy (DNT) could induce sustained clinical remission and weight gain, and if
      so does this enhance the ability for GH to reverse growth failure. METHODS: An
      uncontrolled prospective case study was undertaken in six moderate- severe CD
      patients, two of whom had completed growth. All were treated with DNT. Adequate
      caloric and protein ( >or= 3g/kg/d) intake for catch up weight was prescribed.
      Dairy products, certain grains and carrageenan containing foods were eliminated. 
      Nutraceuticals, consisting of fish peptides, bovine colostrum, boswellia serrata,
      curcumin and a multivitamin were administered daily. Lactobacillus GG, a
      probiotic, was administered twice weekly. Recombinant human GH (rhGH) was
      administered daily. RESULTS: Within 2 months of starting DNT all six patients
      went into remission, with discontinuation of all pharmacological drugs. Three
      patients have remained in sustained remission for 4 to 8 years. One patient with 
      very severe CD had recurrence of CD symptoms after being in complete remission
      for 18 months, one patient was in remission for 3 years but symptoms recurred
      when she became less compliant to DNT and one recently treated patient remains in
      remission after 6 months. With the addition of rhGH, the 4 growing patients had
      good-excellent growth response CONCLUSION: DNT engendered prolonged remission and
      restoration of normal weight in moderate-severe juvenile CD patients, providing
      conditions that enabled rhGH to stimulate growth. These findings justify larger
      controlled trials to evaluate the long-term benefit of compliance to DNT in both 
      juvenile and adult CD patients.

TI  - Dietary factors in chronic inflammation: food tolerances and intolerances of a
      New Zealand Caucasian Crohn's disease population.
PG  - 123-38
LID - 10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2010.01.020 [doi]
AB  - Diet is known to play a major role in the symptoms of the inflammatory bowel
      disease, Crohn's disease (CD). Although no single diet is appropriate to all
      individuals, most CD patients are aware of foods that provide adverse or
      beneficial effects. This study seeks to categorise foods in relation to their
      effects on symptoms of CD, in a New Zealand Caucasian population. Four hundred
      and forty-six subjects from two different centres in New Zealand were recruited
      into the study. An extensive dietary questionnaire (257 food items in 15 groups) 
      recorded self-reported dietary tolerances and intolerances. Across each of the
      food groups, there were statistically significant differences among responses to 
      foods. A two-dimensional graphical summary enabled stratification of foods
      according to the probability that they will be either beneficial or detrimental. 
      A small number of foods are frequently considered to be beneficial, including
      white fish, salmon and tuna, gluten-free products, oatmeal, bananas, boiled
      potatoes, sweet potatoes (kumara), pumpkin, soya milk, goat's milk and yoghurt.
      Foods that are typically considered detrimental include grapefruit, chilli or
      chilli sauce, corn and corn products, peanuts, cream, salami, curried foods, cola
      drinks, high energy drinks, beer, and red wine. For a number of the food items,
      the same item that was beneficial for one group of subjects was detrimental to
      others; in particular soya milk, goat's milk, yoghurt, oatmeal, kiwifruit,
      prunes, apple, broccoli, cauliflower, linseed, pumpkin seed, sunflower seed,
      ginger and ginger products, beef, lamb, liver, and oily fish. It was not possible
      to identify a specific group of food items that should be avoided by all CD
      patients. The wide range of detrimental items suggests that dietary maintenance
      of remission is likely to be difficult, and to exclude a substantial number of
      foods. Personalised diets may be especially important to these individuals.

      double-blind cross-over diet intervention study.
PG  - 252-64
LID - 10.1159/000264649 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Environmental factors are thought to play an important role in the
      development of Crohn's disease (CD). Immune responses against auto-antigens or
      food antigens may be a reason for the perpetuation of inflammation. METHODS: In a
      pilot study, 79 CD patients and 20 healthy controls were examined for food
      immunoglobulin G (IgG). Thereafter, the clinical relevance of these food IgG
      antibodies was assessed in a double-blind cross-over study with 40 patients.
      Based on the IgG antibodies, a nutritional intervention was planned. The
      interferon (IFN)gamma secretion of T cells was measured. Eosinophil-derived
      neurotoxin was quantified in stool. RESULTS: The pilot study resulted in a
      significant difference of IgG antibodies in serum between CD patients and healthy
      controls. In 84 and 83% of the patients, respectively, IgG antibodies against
      processed cheese and yeast were detected. The daily stool frequency significantly
      decreased by 11% during a specific diet compared with a sham diet. Abdominal pain
      reduced and general well-being improved. IFNgamma secretion of T cells increased.
      No difference for eosinophil-derived neurotoxin in stool was detected.
      CONCLUSION: A nutritional intervention based on circulating IgG antibodies
      against food antigens showed effects with respect to stool frequency. The
      mechanisms by which IgG antibodies might contribute to disease activity remain to
      be elucidated.

AB  - 75% of hospital patients with Crohn's disease (CD) suffer from malnutrition and
      one third of CD patients have a body mass index below 20. Inflammatory bowel
      diseases (IBD) patients have many vitamin and nutrient deficiencies which can
      lead to important consequences such as hyperhomocysteinemia which is associated
      with a higher risk of thromboembolic disease. Nutritional deficiencies in IBD
      patients are the result of insufficient intake, malabsorption and protein-losing 
      enteropathy as well as the metabolic distubances directly induced by the chronic 
      disease and its treatments, in particular corticosteroids. Screening for
      nutritional deficiencies in chronic disease patients is warranted. Managing the
      deficiencies involves simple nutritional guidelines, vitamin supplements, and
      nutritional support in the worst cases, in particular in children in order to
      limit the impact of IBD on growth. In active CD, enteral nutrition is the first
      line therapy in children and should be used as sole therapy in adults mainly when

PG  - S228-34

AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases are the result of an abnormal immune response to
      environmental factors including the intestinal microbiota. Epithelial and immune 
      cells of the intestinal mucosa recognise specific bacterial molecules via Toll
      like and NOD like receptors and this interaction modulates the inflammatory
      response (activation of the NF-kappaB pathway). It is thus rational to try
      treatments which could modify the intestinal microbiota i.e. antibiotics, new
      substrates (prebiotics) or new micro-organisms (probiotics). We review the
      literature on existing evidence for the efficacy of probiotic strains or
      combinations in patients with pouchitis (good evidence), ulcerative colitis (fair
      evidence), and Crohn's disease (no evidence at the present time). We also discuss
      the mechanisms of action, the use of microbial agents as pharmacological vectors,
      the development of genetically modified probiotics (including a clinical pilot
      trial in patients with Crohn's disease), and safety issues.

PG  - S137-44
LID - 10.1016/S0399-8320(09)73149-5 [doi]
AB  - Defensins are endogenous antibiotics with microbicidal activity against
      Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, fungi, enveloped viruses and protozoa. 
      A disturbed antimicrobial defense, as provided by Paneth- and other epithelial
      cell defensins, seems to be a critical factor in the pathogenesis of inflammatory
      bowel diseases. Conspicuously, there is a relative lack of Paneth cell
      beta-defensins HD-5 and HD-6 in ileal Crohn's disease, both in the absence of a
      pattern recognition receptor NOD2 mutation and, even more pronounced, in its
      presence. This deficit is independent of concurrent active inflammation and
      results in a diminished antibacterial killing by the mucosa. The Crohn's disease 
      mucosa has not only a significant lack in killing different Escherichia coli but 
      also an impaired ability in clearing Staphylococcus aureus as well as anaerobic
      micro-organisms. Thus, this dysfunction in antibacterial barrier seems to be
      broad and is not restricted to a single bacterial strain. In addition to directly
      controlling barrier function, Paneth cell defensins also regulate the composition
      of the bacterial stool flora. In the majority of patients, the Paneth cell
      deficiency is mediated by WNT signalling which suggests a disturbed Paneth cell
      differentiation in ileal Crohn's disease. In contrast, colonic Crohn's disease is
      characterised by an impaired induction of mucosal beta-defensins, partly due to a
      low copy number of the beta-defensin gene cluster. Therefore it seems plausible
      that bacteria take advantage of a niche formed by defensin deficiency. This would
      represent a paradigm shift in understanding Crohn's disease and provides a target
      for future therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Humans have evolved with oral exposure to dietary microparticles and
      nanoparticles as a normal occurrence but the ever-growing exploitation of
      nanotechnology is likely to increase exposure further, both qualitatively and
      quantitatively. Moreover, unlike the situation with respirable particles,
      relatively little is known about gastrointestinal intake and handling of
      nanoparticles. With a long term interest in gut exposure and responses to dietary
      microparticles, our group is now applying its expertise to nanoparticles in the
      gastrointestinal tract. Here we aim to address (i) the current challenges
      associated with the characterisation of particle-host or particle-cell
      interactions, (ii) the origin and mechanisms of uptake of particles in the
      gastrointestinal tract, especially via the Peyer's patch and (iii) potential
      cellular effects of nanoparticles in the generation of reactive oxygen species
      and inflammasome activation, or microparticles in their adjuvant activity in
      pro-inflammatory signalling and immune responsiveness.

TI  - Combining nutrition, food science and engineering in developing solutions to
      Inflammatory bowel diseases--omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids as an example.
PG  - 60-72
LID - 10.1039/c0fo00057d [doi]
AB  - The Inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are
      debilitating conditions, characterised by lifelong sensitivity to certain foods, 
      and often a need for surgery and life-long medication. The anti-inflammatory
      effects of long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated acids justify their inclusion in
      enteral nutrition formulas that have been associated with disease remission.
      However, there have been variable data in clinical trials to test supplementary
      omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in inducing or maintaining remission in these
      diseases. Although variability in trial design has been suggested as a major
      factor, we suggest that variability in processing and presentation of the
      products may be equally or more important. The nature of the source, and rapidity
      of getting the fish or other food source to processing or to market, will affect 
      the percentage of the various fatty acids, possible presence of heavy metal
      contaminants and oxidation status of the various fatty acids. For dietary
      supplements or fortified foods, whether the product is encapsulated or not,
      whether storage is under nitrogen or not, and length of time between harvest,
      processing and marketing will again profoundly affect the properties of the final
      product. Clinical trials to test efficacy of these products in IBD to date have
      utilised the relevant skills of pharmacology and gastroenterology. We suggest
      that knowledge from food science, nutrition and engineering will be essential to 
      establish the true role of this important group of compounds in these diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Enteric bacteria play an important early role in the pathogenesis of 
      Crohn's disease. AIM: To perform a meta-analysis of trials testing antibiotics or
      probiotics for prevention of post-operative recurrence of Crohn's disease.
      METHODS: Review of all randomized controlled trials comparing antibiotics or
      probiotics with placebo in prevention of endoscopic or clinical recurrence of
      Crohn's disease after surgical resection. Fixed-effect meta-analysis was
      performed with dichotomous data summarized using relative risk with 95%
      confidence intervals, where appropriate. RESULTS: Seven studies were identified
      as suitable for inclusion (two comparing antibiotics with placebo, five comparing
      probiotics with placebo). The use of nitroimidazole antibiotics (metronidazole,
      ornidazole) reduced the risk of clinical (RR 0.23; 95% CI 0.09-0.57, NNT = 4) and
      endoscopic (RR 0.44; 95% CI 0.26-0.74, NNT = 4) recurrence relative to placebo.
      However, these agents were associated with higher risk of adverse events (RR
      2.39, 95% CI 1.5-3.7) and patient withdrawal. Probiotic administration was not
      associated with any significant difference in risk of recurrence compared with
      placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Nitroimidazole antibiotics are effective in the prevention 
      of post-operative Crohn's disease recurrence, but their side-effects limit
      acceptability. Probiotics have failed to show efficacy for post-operative
      prophylaxis, but may merit further study.

TI  - [Vitamin D supplementation in adults--guidelines].
PG  - 39-45
AB  - Vitamin D is necessary in maintaining appropriate calcium and phosphate
      homeostasis in the body (classical function) and ensuring appropriate functioning
      of many tissues, organs and cells, unrelated to mineral economy (non-classical
      function). Vitamin D deficiency in adults may cause osteomalacia, increase
      fracture risk in osteoporosis, induce cardiovascular diseases, diabetes type 1
      and 2, multiple sclerosis, Lesniowski-Crohn disease, and cancer, including colon,
      breast, and prostate cancer. Possible causes of vitamin D deficiency in a healthy
      population include decreased cutaneous synthesis and an inadequate intake of
      vitamin D, both in food and in supplements. Vitamin D deficiency level (25(OH) D.
      <20 ng/mL), is fairly widespread, being found in a substantial percentage of
      healthy subjects around the world, regardless of race, gender and age. Daily
      vitamin D dose, as determined by the Food and Nutrition Board in 1997, is now
      rather insufficient, the biggest problem being associated with maximal vitamin D 
      levels (50 mug/day) in actually available food supplements. Nowadays, it is
      recommended that adults need a minimum of 800-1,000 U/day when their exposure to 
      the sun is inadequate (in Poland from October to April). This dosage should be
      provided to all subjects who avoid sunlight, as well as to those aged over 65
      because of their slower skin synthesis of vitamin D and for its proven
      anti-fracture and anti-fall effects.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Crohn's disease is a chronic condition of the gastrointestinal
      tract. It is characterised by transmural, granulomatous inflammation that occurs 
      in a discontinuous pattern, with a tendency to form fistulae. The cause is
      unknown but may depend on interactions between genetic predisposition,
      environmental triggers, and mucosal immunity. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted 
      a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What
      are the effects of medical treatments to induce remission in adults with Crohn's 
      disease? What are the effects of surgical interventions to induce and maintain
      remission in adults with small-bowel Crohn's disease? What are the effects of
      surgical interventions to induce remission in adults with colonic Crohn's
      disease? What are the effects of medical interventions to maintain remission in
      adults with Crohn's disease; and to maintain remission following surgery? What
      are the effects of lifestyle interventions to maintain remission in adults with
      Crohn's disease? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other
      important databases up to December 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated
      periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this
      review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products
      Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 93 systematic reviews, RCTs, or
      observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: In this
      systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety
      of the following interventions: aminosalicylates, antibiotics,
      azathioprine/mercaptopurine, ciclosporin, corticosteroids (oral), enteral
      nutrition, fish oil, infliximab, methotrexate, probiotics, resection, segmental
      colectomy, smoking cessation, and strictureplasty.

AB  - The aim of the study was the evaluation of frequency and titre of IgA ASCA and
      IgG ASCA and p-ANCA, c-ANCA in children with IBD and occurrence of ASCA
      antibodies in relation to coexistence of FA. Patients and methods. The study
      comprised 95 children at the ages of 2 to 18 years. The diagnosis of IBD was
      established on the basis of Porto criteria. Tests of blood serum were performed
      in all children: IgA and IgG ASCA, p-ANCA, c-ANCA using ELISA method. Results.
      IgE-dependent FA was found in 32.5% children with UC and in 21% with CD. We did
      not observe any relation between the occurrence of FA and the frequency and ASCA 
      titre. p-ANCA were significantly more frequent in the group of children with UC. 
      The occurrence of ASCA antibodies was observed in 73.7% of children with CD,
      17.5% with UC and almost 30% with allergic colitis. Conclusions. Patients with CD
      and the presence of ASCA revealed a significantly more frequent localization of
      lesions within the small bowel and a tendency towards older age. We observed a
      connection between the occurrence of antibodies and the examined mutations of
      gene NOD2/CARD15.

      therapeutic options?
PG  - 527-34
LID - smw-12520 [doi]
AB  - During the last few years significant advances have been achieved in the
      understanding of the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A genetic 
      susceptibility to Crohn's disease has been proven by identification of variations
      as risk factor NOD2/CARD15. Functional data on NOD2/CARD15 and NF-kappaB
      activation indicate that an inflammatory reaction of the intestinal mucosa, as an
      immediate response of the innate immune system, may be necessary for the
      maintenance of gut homeostasis. Crohn's disease is now also discussed as an
      impaired and inadequate immune reaction and no longer only as a
      hyper-responsiveness of the mucosal immune system. Data on NOD2/CARD15 expression
      suggest that macrophages and epithelial cells could be the locus of the primary
      pathophysiological defect and that T-cell activation might just be a secondary
      effect inducing chronification of the inflammation, perhaps as backup mechanism
      to insufficient innate immunity. In addition to NOD2/CARD15 there are more
      "innate" pathways by which commensal and pathogenic bacteria can directly be
      hindered to invade the human body (such as interaction with Toll like receptors, 
      TLRs and defensins). The "germ-concept" and the "genetic concept" of IBD
      pathophysiology are converging. However, more time is needed until these
      important insights in IBD pathogenesis will make their way into routine
      diagnostic procedures and treatment of patients with IBD.

PG  - CD006873
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD006873.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recurrence of Crohn's disease is common after intestinal resection. A
      number of agents have been studied in controlled trials with the goal of reducing
      the risk of endoscopic or clinical recurrence of Crohn's disease following
      surgery. OBJECTIVES: To undertake a systematic review of the use of medical
      therapies for the prevention of post-operative recurrence of Crohn's disease
      SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
      Trials (CENTRAL) were searched to identify relevant studies. References from
      selected papers and abstracts from Digestive Disease Week were also searched.
      SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials that compared medical therapy to
      placebo or other medical agents for the prevention of recurrence of intestinal
      Crohn's disease were selected for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two
      authors reviewed all abstracts containing search terms, and those meeting
      inclusion criteria were selected for full data abstraction. Dichotomous data were
      summarised using relative risk and 95% confidence intervals. A fixed-effects
      model was used, and sensitivity analysis performed. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-three
      studies were identified for inclusion. Probiotics were not superior to placebo
      for any outcome measured. The use of nitroimidazole antibiotics appeared to
      reduce the risk of clinical (RR 0.23; 95%CI 0.09 to 0.57, NNT=4) and endoscopic
      (RR 0.44; 95%CI 0.26 to 0.74, NNT = 4) recurrence relative to placebo. However,
      these agents were associated with higher risk of serious adverse events (RR 2.39,
      95% CI 1.5 to 3.7). Mesalamine therapy was associated with a significantly
      reduced risk of clinical recurrence (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.94, NNT = 12), and
      severe endoscopic recurrence (RR 0.50; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.84, NNT = 8) when
      compared to placebo. Azathioprine/6MP was also associated with a significantly
      reduced risk of clinical recurrence (RR 0.59; 95% CI 0.38 to 0.92, NNT = 7), and 
      severe endoscopic recurrence (RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.92, NNT = 4), when
      compared to placebo. Neither agent had a higher risk than placebo of serious
      adverse events. When compared to azathioprine/6MP, mesalamine was associated with
      a higher risk of any endoscopic recurrence (RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.06), but a 
      lower risk of serious adverse events (RR 0.51; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.89). There was no
      significant difference between mesalamine and azathioprine/6MP for any other
      outcome. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There are insufficient randomised controlled
      trials of infliximab, budesonide, tenovil and interleukin-10 to draw conclusions.
      Nitro-imidazole antibiotics, mesalamine and immunosuppressive therapy with
      azathioprine/6-MP or infliximab all appear to be superior to placebo for the
      prevention of post-operative recurrence of Crohn's disease. The cost, toxicity
      and tolerability of these approaches require careful consideration to determine
      the optimal approach for post-operative prophylaxis.

AB  - PURPOSE: Hitherto, the efficacy of enteral nutrition (EN) on clinical outcomes
      during biological maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease (CD) has not been
      investigated. This prospective study was to assess the efficacy of EN on the
      maintenance rate of clinical remission in patients with quiescent CD receiving
      infliximab as maintenance therapy. METHODS: Fifty-six patients who achieved
      clinical remission with infliximab induction therapy received infliximab as
      maintenance therapy (5 mg/kg, every 8 weeks). Thirty-two of the 56 patients
      received concomitant EN: elemental diet infusion during night-time and a low fat 
      diet during daytime (EN group), while the remaining 24 patients received neither 
      nutritional therapy nor food restriction (non-EN group). All patients were
      followed for 56 weeks; CD activity index (CDAI) was assessed and CDAI < 150 was
      defined as clinical remission. RESULTS: During the 56-week observation, the mean 
      CDAI was not significantly different between the 2 groups. Seven patients in the 
      EN group ceased EN therapy because they maintained complete remission. On an
      intention-to-treat basis, 25 patients in the EN group (78%) and 16 patients in
      the non-EN group (67%) remained in clinical remission during the 56-week
      observation (P = 0.51). CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes of this prospective study
      showed that concomitant EN during infliximab maintenance therapy does not
      significantly increase the maintenance rate of clinical remission in patients
      with CD.

TI  - Evolving concepts in Clostridium difficile colitis.
PG  - 400-5
AB  - Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the most important cause of nosocomial
      diarrhea. The emergence of a hypervirulent strain and other factors including
      antibiotic overuse contribute to the increasing incidence and severity of this
      potentially lethal infection. CDI has been reported in persons previously
      considered as low risk, such as young healthy persons without exposure to health 
      care settings or antibiotics, peripartum women, and children. In patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease, the risk of C. difficile infection is even greater,
      with higher rates of hospitalization, bowel surgery, and mortality. With
      increasing incidence and severity of disease, the need for improved diagnostic,
      treatment, and infection control strategies cannot be overstated.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The pharmacokinetics and safety of Asacol (Tillotts Pharma AG,
      Ziefen, Switzerland), which has been used worldwide to treat ulcerative colitis
      and Crohn's disease, were studied in Japanese healthy male volunteers. METHODS:
      Drug plasma concentrations and urinary and fecal excretions after a single dose
      (400-4800 mg) and multiple doses (3600 mg/day for 7 days) were investigated.
      RESULTS: All adverse events were "not serious." The peak plasma concentration (C 
      max) was reached at 12.3-18.0 hours after a single dose, and the C max and area
      under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of mesalazine and its N-acetyl
      metabolite were proportional to the doses. The C max and AUC in non-Japanese
      subjects reported in the literature were closely correlated to findings in
      Japanese subjects, and external excretions were also similar in the Japanese and 
      non-Japanese subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Asacol was safe and well tolerated in this
      Japanese population, and the non-Japanese clinical data could be extrapolated to 
      the Japanese population.

AB  - Toll like receptors (TLR) regulate innate immune responses sensing byproducts of 
      intestinal microbiota. We examined responses to TLR agonists in children with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
      obtained from children with IBD [Crohn's disease (CD, n = 10), ulcerative colitis
      (UC, n = 10)], children with non-IgE-mediated food allergy (NFA, n = 20), and
      controls (n = 15) were tested for their production of proinflammatory and
      counter-regulatory cytokines with TLR agonists in comparison with their cytokine 
      production against milk protein and candida. IBD patients were all in the
      inactive state. IBD PBMC produced more IL-6 with all the TLR agonists tested than
      controls. CD PBMC produced more counter-regulatory cytokines with TLR agonists,
      while UC PBMC produced more IL-1ss and IL-10 with TLR 7/8 agonist than controls. 
      Cytokine production by NFA PBMC did not differ from controls. CD but not UC PBMC 
      produced more IFN-gamma and IL-17 with candida. Aberrant responses to TLR
      agonists may be associated with increase in IFN-gamma/IL-17 production against
      candida in CD children.

PG  - 400-4
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181a0d269 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rifaximin, Food and Drug Administration approved for traveler's
      diarrhea, has been used in adult patients with active inflammatory bowel disease 
      (IBD). This retrospective review was undertaken to determine its role in the
      treatment of pediatric IBD. METHODS: A review of children with IBD, who were
      treated with rifaximin from 2005 to 2007 at our institution, was performed.
      Collected data included diagnosis, age, medication history, recent therapy,
      symptom, and interval to improvement. Response was rated as none, moderate, or
      optimum relief for each symptom. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were identified, 
      12 with Crohn disease and 11 with ulcerative colitis (UC) with a median age of 13
      years. The most common complaints were diarrhea in 20 patients (87%), abdominal
      pain in 17 (74%), and bloody stools in 15 (65%). Rifaximin was given at doses
      ranging between 10 and 30 mg/kg (Table 1). Of the 20 patients who presented with 
      diarrhea 5 (25%) had relief of diarrhea within 1 week of starting rifaximin and
      total of 12 patients (60%) experienced relief within 4 weeks. Abdominal pain
      resolved in 3 of 17 patients (17.6%) within 1 week and in 12 of 17 (70.6%) within
      4 weeks. Visible bleeding resolved in 10 of 15 patients (66.7%) within 4 weeks of
      therapy (Table 2). Analysis of concurrent medications showed 61% experienced
      relief of symptoms when addition of rifaximin was the only meaningful treatment
      change. CONCLUSIONS: Rifaximin was well-tolerated and showed favorable results.
      Larger doses of rifaximin were statistically better for abdominal pain. Further
      studies are needed to evaluate efficacy and optimal dosing of rifaximin in this
      population.

AB  - Carrying a functional single nucleotide polymorphism (L503F, c. 1672 C>T) in the 
      gene for the Na-dependent organic cation transporter (OCTN1), increases the risk 
      of Crohn's disease (CD) in some, but not all, populations. Case-control data on
      New Zealand Caucasians show no differences for CD risk between individuals
      carrying the L503F OCTN1 C-allele when compared with those carrying the variant
      T-allele. However, more of the New Zealand CD cases report intolerance to maize
      and mushrooms than those who report beneficial effects or no differences. The
      OCTN1 gene encodes a transporter for ergothionine, a fungal metabolite at high
      levels in mushrooms but not widely common in other dietary items. An inability to
      tolerate mushrooms showed statistically significant associations with the variant
      OCTN1 genotype. That is, among those individuals reporting adverse effects from
      mushrooms, there was a higher frequency of the variant T-allele when compared
      with the general population, or with CD patients overall. We believe that this is
      a novel gene-diet association, suggesting that individuals carrying the OCTN1
      variant single nucleotide polymorphism may have an enhanced risk of adverse
      symptoms associated with consuming mushrooms. Nutrigenomic approaches to dietary 
      recommendations may be appropriate in this group.

      antigen-presenting ability.

LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.0804369 [doi]
AB  - Intestinal APCs are considered critical in maintaining the balance between the
      response against harmful pathogens and the induction of tolerance to commensal
      bacteria and food Ags. Recently, several studies indicated the presence of
      gut-specific APC subsets, which possess both macrophage and dendritic cell (DC)
      markers. These unique APC subsets play important roles in gut immunity,
      especially for immune regulation against commensal bacteria. Herein, we examined 
      a unique macrophage subset, which coexpressed the macrophage (Mphi) marker CD14
      and the DC marker CD209 in human intestinal lamina propria (LP). The LP Mphi
      subset in both normal control subjects or Crohn's disease (CD) patients induced
      proliferation of naive CD4(+) T cells as well as monocyte-derived DCs, and it
      expressed retinoic acid synthetic enzyme retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 and
      retinol dehydrogenase 10, which induced expression of gut homing receptors on T
      cells in a retinoic acid-dependent manner. Moreover, the LP Mphi subset strongly 
      evoked differentiation of Th1 cells and slightly induced Th17 cells in both
      normal control subjects and CD patients; the inducing potential was highest in CD
      patients. In CD patients, Th17, but not Th1, induction by the LP Mphi subset was 
      enhanced in the presence of commensal bacteria Ags. This enhancement was not
      observed in normal control subjects. The Th17 induction by the LP Mphi subset was
      inhibited by neutralization of IL-6 and IL-1beta, but it was enhanced by blockade
      of retinoic acid signaling. These observations highlight a role for LP Mphi in
      the enhanced Th1, and potentially in Th17 differentiation, at the inflammatory
      site of inflammatory bowel diseases.

TI  - [Video capsule endoscopy--preliminary experience in university hospital setting].
PG  - 159-64
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The use of video capsule endoscopy (VCE) started in late 2001 when 
      it was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Since then, we are
      able to visualize small bowel mucosa with a minimally invasive technique, very
      comfortable for patients, with very few complications and without the need of
      hospitalization. At Dubrava University Hospital, we have been using VCE since
      October 2006, and by February 2008 we examined 30 patients. AIM: The aim of the
      study was to present our preliminary results in the use of VCE during a period of
      one year and five months. We also report indications and contraindications for
      VCE, and patient preparation. METHODS: In this retrospective study we reviewed
      records on 30 patients that had undergone VCE at Dubrava University Hospital,
      Zagreb, Croatia, between October 2006 and February 2008. The indications for VCE 
      were restricted to the investigation of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB) 
      (n = 10), iron deficiency anemia (n = 2), suspected Crohn's disease (n = 1),
      assessment of known small bowel Crohn's disease (n = 5), unexplained diarrhea (n 
      = 6), chronic abdominal pain (n = 3), suspected ganglioneurinoma (n = 1) and
      suspected polyposis syndrome (n = 2). To be eligible for VCE, patients had to
      have previously undergone usual diagnostic methods of upper endoscopy,
      colonoscopy and small bowel follow-through, without discovering the cause of
      their symptoms. Before swallowing the capsule, patients were instructed not to
      eat anything the day before VCE and to drink 4 L of liquids, and additional 2 L
      magnesium sulfate. In all patients we used Olympus EndoCapsule Software (Tokyo,
      Japan). Results were interpreted by one specialist, gastroenterologist. RESULTS: 
      Definitive diagnosis was made in 15 patients. Suspect findings were noted in 2
      patients, whereas no diagnosis could be established in 13 patients. According to 
      our experience, VCE is a promising new method that has a high diagnostic yield in
      patients with OGIB and known Crohn's disease. Use of VCE enabled definitive
      diagnosis to be made in 6 of 10 patients with OGIB after all previously used
      diagnostic methods had failed to reveal any pathological finding. In the group of
      OGIB patients, angiodysplasia was the most common findings (4 of 10 patients). In
      the group of patients with Crohn's disease, progression of the disease to
      neotherminal ileum was recorded in 3 of 5 patients. Our experience also confirmed
      the VCE to be a very safe method; capsule retention was recorded in only one
      patient. DISCUSSION: Although VCE enabled us to visualize the small bowel mucosa 
      and therefore helped us establish the diagnosis in cases where other diagnostic
      methods had failed, it still has some important limitations, the major one being 
      the impossibility to take biopsies and to perform any therapeutic procedures.
      However, it has a high diagnostic yield in cases of OGIB and Crohn's disease, is 
      very comfortable for patients, and has a low incidence of complications (capsule 
      retention). When making definitive diagnosis, one should always consider
      patient's history and physical examination findings as well as other possible
      causes of small bowel mucosal impairment. CONCLUSION: VCE is a promising new
      technique that has a high diagnostic yield in patients with OGIB and Crohn's
      disease. However, more studies need to be done to establish definitive
      indications, cost-effectiveness and the best way of patient preparation for VCE.

TI  - Potential for amino acids supplementation during inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 518-24
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21017 [doi]
AB  - The pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) is multifactorial and
      involves interactions of gut luminal content with mucosal barrier and especially 
      immune cells. Malnutrition is a frequent issue during IBD flares, especially in
      Crohn's disease (CD) patients, and nutritional support is frequently used to
      treat malnutrition but also in an attempt to modulate intestinal inflammation.
      The use of oral or enteral nutrition intervention in IBDs may be effective, alone
      or in combination with drugs, to achieve and maintain remission. However,
      standard diets are less effective than new-generation biotherapies and could be
      improved by supplementation with specific immunomodulatory amino acids.
      Experimental studies evaluating glutamine, the preferential substrate for
      enterocytes, are promising. Some clinical studies with oral glutamine in CD are
      until now disappointing, but new formulations and targeting could enhance
      glutamine efficacy at the site of mucosal lesions. The role of arginine, involved
      in nitric oxide and polyamines synthesis, still remains debated. However, the
      effects of these amino acids in IBD have been poorly documented in humans. Other 
      candidates like glycine, cysteine, histidine, or taurine should also be evaluated
      in the future.

TI  - Fatty acids, IL6, and TNFalpha polymorphisms: an example of nutrigenetics in
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 2241-9
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2009.313 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this work was to study the interaction between genetic
      polymorphisms (single-nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) of pro- and
      anti-inflammatory cytokines and fat intake on the risk of developing Crohn's
      disease (CD) or modifying disease activity. METHODS: Seven SNPs in interleukin 1 
      (IL1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), lymphotoxin alpha (LTalpha), and
      IL6 genes were analyzed in 116 controls and 99 patients with CD. The type of fat 
      intake was evaluated, and the interaction between SNPs and dietary fat in
      modulating disease activity was analyzed. RESULTS: Individuals who were
      homozygous for the IL6-174G/C polymorphism had a six-fold higher risk for CD
      (odds ratio (OR)=6.1; 95% confidence interval (95% CI)=1.9-19.4), whereas the TT 
      genotype on the TNFalpha-857C/T polymorphism was associated with more active
      disease (OR=10.4; 95% CI=1.1-94.1). A high intake of total, saturated, and
      monounsaturated fats, as well as a higher ratio of n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty 
      acid (PUFA), was associated with a more active phenotype (P<0.05). Furthermore,
      there was an interaction between dietary fat intake and SNPs, with a high intake 
      of saturated and monounsaturated fats being associated with active disease,
      mainly in patients carrying the variant alleles of the 857 TNFalpha polymorphism 
      (OR=6.0, 95% CI=1.4-26.2; OR=5.17; 95% CI=1.4-19.2, respectively) and the 174 IL6
      polymorphism (OR=2.95; 95% CI=1.0-9.1; OR=3.21; 95% CI=1.0-10.4, respectively).
      Finally, low intake of n-3 PUFA and high n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio in patients with the 
      TNFalpha 857 polymorphism were associated with higher disease activity (OR=3.6;
      95% CI=1.0-13.0; OR=5.92; 95% CI=1.3-26.5, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These
      results show that different types of fat may interact with cytokine genotype,
      modulating disease activity.

AB  - Probiotic bacteria, commensals selected for their presumed therapeutic properties
      when ingested orally, have attracted increasing attention for their possible
      efficacy in a range of gastrointestinal disorders, including the inflammatory
      bowel diseases of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Since the barrier
      properties of the intestinal epithelium are believed to be compromised as a
      consequence (or perhaps as a cause) of intestinal inflammation, we hypothesized
      that probiotics might ameliorate such epithelial dysfunction as part of their
      spectrum of beneficial effects. We have used both cell line and animal models to 
      test this hypothesis and show that two probiotics have significant effects on
      epithelial barrier properties, both at baseline and when deranged by inflammatory
      cytokines or in the setting of inflammation in a mouse model of colitis.
      Moreover, the probiotics also normalize epithelial ion transport function, which 
      could also contribute to clinical efficacy. Overall, our studies extend the
      spectrum of functional effects attributable to probiotics, and may provide a
      rationale for their use in a range of gastrointestinal disorders associated with 
      epithelial dysfunction.

AB  - Although a causal link between Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis
      (MAP) and Crohn's disease has not been proved, previous studies suggest that the 
      potential routes of human exposure to MAP should be investigated. We conducted a 
      systematic review of literature concerning the likelihood of contamination of
      food products with MAP and the likely changes in the quantity of MAP in dairy and
      meat products along their respective production chains. Relevant data were
      extracted from 65 research papers and synthesized qualitatively. Although
      estimates of the prevalence of Johne's disease are scarce, particularly for
      non-dairy herds, the available data suggest that the likelihood of contamination 
      of raw milk with MAP in most studied regions is substantial. The presence of MAP 
      in raw and pasteurized milk has been the subject of several studies which show
      that pasteurized milk is not always MAP-free and that the effectiveness of
      pasteurization in inactivating MAP depends on the initial concentration of the
      agent in raw milk. The most recent studies indicated that beef can be
      contaminated with MAP via dissemination of the pathogen in the tissues of
      infected animals. Currently available data suggests that the likelihood of dairy 
      and meat products being contaminated with MAP on retail sale should not be
      ignored.

TI  - Nausea and vomiting in people with cancer and other chronic diseases.
LID - 2406 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Nausea and vomiting occur in 40-70% of people with cancer, and are 
      also common in other chronic conditions such as hepatitis C and inflammatory
      bowel disease. Nausea and vomiting become more common as disease progresses.
      METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the
      following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for nausea and
      vomiting occurring either as a result of the disease or its treatment, in adults 
      with cancer? What are the effects of treatments for nausea and vomiting occurring
      either as a result of the disease or its treatment, in adults with chronic
      diseases other than cancer? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library,
      and other important databases up to April 2008 (Clinical Evidence reviews are
      updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of
      this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products
      Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found nine systematic reviews, RCTs, or
      observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE
      evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In this
      systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety
      of the following interventions: 5HT(3) antagonists, antihistamines,
      antimuscarinics, atypical antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, butyrophenones,
      cannabinoids, corticosteroids, haloperidol, metoclopramide, NK1 antagonists,
      phenothiazines, prokinetics, 5HT(3) antagonists plus corticosteroids, and venting
      gastrostomy.

TI  - Antibiotics and probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease: why, when, and how.
PG  - 329-33
LID - 10.1097/MOG.0b013e32832b20bf [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize recent evidence on the role of intestinal
      bacteria in inflammatory bowel diseases, and of antibiotics and probiotics in
      their treatment. The implications connected with the use of antibiotics are also 
      examined. RECENT FINDINGS: The hypothesis that Mycobacterium paratuberculosis
      could be a causative agent of Crohn's disease has not been confirmed by a large
      trial on symptomatic patients treated by a combination of antibiotics active
      against this bacterium. An increased number of adherent-invasive Escherichia coli
      have been found in the intestinal tissue of patients with Crohn's disease, but
      their role in the pathogenesis of this condition remains to be defined. The
      combination of metronidazole and azathioprine, associating the effects of a
      reduced bacterial load with immunosuppression, appears to be a therapeutic option
      to decrease the recurrence of postoperative Crohn's disease in high-risk
      patients. However, concerns are raised by the possibility that antibiotics may
      induce disease relapse due to Clostridium difficile infection. SUMMARY: Recent
      literature provides increasing support for the use of antibiotics in Crohn's
      disease, although the side effects limit their long-term use. The efficacy of
      antibiotics in ulcerative colitis is not confirmed by the available literature,
      except in severe colitis. More trials are needed to support the use of probiotics
      as therapy in inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - The gut microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1528-36
AB  - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the two principal forms of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The root causes of these chronic and acute
      immunological disorders are unclear, but intestinal microorganisms are known to
      play a key role in the initiation and maintenance of disease. However, at
      present, there is no clear evidence for a single transmissible agent being
      involved in IBD aetiology. Although marked alterations occur in faecal and
      mucosal bacterial communities in IBD, it is unclear whether they are responsible 
      for causing disease, or are due to changes in the gut environment that result
      from inflammatory reactions and extensive tissue destruction. Despite the
      involvement of microorganisms in inflammatory processes, antibiotic therapy has
      generally been unsuccessful in IBD. However, recent studies involving the use of 
      probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics suggest that there is potential for
      controlling these diseases through manipulation of the composition of the gut
      microbiota, and direct interactions with the gut immune system.

LID - 10.1089/fpd.2008.0226 [doi]
AB  - Johne's disease or paratuberculosis is a chronic granulomatous inflammation of
      the small intestine of ruminants caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp.
      paratuberculosis (MAP). Recent studies suggest an association between MAP and
      Crohn's disease in humans. MAP can become widely distributed within the tissues
      of infected animals, and meat may be a possible route of exposure of MAP to
      humans. In this study, 47 dairy and beef cattle were examined for the occurrence 
      of viable MAP in diaphragm muscle. At the slaughterhouse, gut tissues, diaphragm 
      muscle, blood, and feces of the 47 animals were collected for bacteriological
      culture, as well as gut samples for histopathological analysis. MAP was detected 
      by bacteriological culture and conventional and real-time IS900 polymerase chain 
      reaction in the diaphragm muscle of six infected cattle at slaughter (13%). The
      six animals showing evidence of MAP in diaphragm muscle had diffuse lesions and
      severe granulomatous inflammation in ileocecal lymph nodes, jejunal lymph nodes, 
      ileocecal valve, and ileum. All six had heavy bacterial load in mesenteric lymph 
      nodes, ileocecal valve, ileum, and jejunum, and four showed clinical signs of
      paratuberculosis. Two animals did not show clinical signs but had viable MAP in
      intestinal tissues and in diaphragm muscle as well. MAP was found in blood of
      only one of the six animals showing evidence of MAP in diaphragm muscle and in
      feces of three of them. In general, there was a positive association between
      enteric lesion severity, clinical signs of paratuberculosis, heavy bacterial load
      in intestinal tissues, fecal shedding of MAP, and the presence of disseminated
      MAP infection in diaphragm muscle. The results of this study demonstrated that
      MAP can be detected and cultured from muscle of MAP-infected cattle destined for 
      human consumption and suggest a possible risk of exposure of humans to MAP via
      contaminated meat.

AB  - Approximately 25 % of individuals with Crohn's disease (CD), a life-long
      relapsing-remitting disease, are diagnosed during childhood and adolescence.
      Symptoms of CD, including abdominal pain, nausea and diarrhoea, can lead to
      reduced food intake, which may negatively have an impact on nutritional status
      during this critical period of growth and development. The aims of the present
      study were to assess the growth and adequacy of dietary intakes of children with 
      CD at Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick, and compare with healthy controls.
      Sixty-three subjects aged 10-16 years were recruited, including: children with
      active CD (n 18), children with CD in remission (n 23) and healthy controls (n
      22). Dietary intake was assessed using a FFQ and compared with current Australian
      recommended dietary intakes (RDI). Growth and dietary intakes were compared
      between groups. Subjects with active CD had lower weight and BMI Z scores than
      children in remission and controls. The energy intakes of children with active CD
      and those in remission were significantly lower than estimated energy
      requirements (P = 0.001 and P = 0.03 respectively). Children with active CD did
      not meet the RDI for Fe and their Ca intake was lower than the RDI (P = 0.04). In
      conclusion, the dietary intake of children with active CD was impaired, with
      inadequate intakes of energy, Ca and Fe. Reduced energy intakes during active
      disease may contribute to poor weight gain and impaired growth. Quantifying
      nutrient intake and ascertaining requirements for nutritional supplementation are
      essential components of successful management in paediatric CD.

TI  - Orofacial granulomatosis in childhood-a clinical entity that may indicate Crohn's
      disease as well as food allergy.
PG  - 1162-7
LID - 10.1111/j.1651-2227.2009.01295.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: Orofacial granulomatosis (OFG) is a rare clinical entity with orofacial
      swelling in association with oral lesions such as mucosal oedema, ulcerations and
      mucosal tags. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the connection
      between OFG in childhood and systemic disease. METHODS: During a 3-year period,
      eight children (9-16 years old) who had been referred to the clinic of oral
      medicine were diagnosed solely with OFG. Thus, none of them had any known
      systemic disease or gastrointestinal symptoms at the time of referral. The
      children were then medically examined and followed up for 6-8 years at the
      department of paediatrics for systemic disease with specific emphasis on
      inflammatory disorders elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract. RESULTS: During
      follow-up, four patients were diagnosed with Crohn's disease (CD). Further, one
      girl was found to have a food allergy-induced OFG, with delayed-type
      hypersensitivity to oats. One boy developed both diabetes and celiac disease
      during the follow-up. Only two patients had no diagnosis of systemic disease at
      the end of the observation period. CONCLUSION: OFG in childhood seems to be
      frequently related to systemic disease, and children with OFG should be referred 
      to a paediatrician for examination and follow-up.

PG  - 839-45
LID - 10.1556/OH.2009.28599 [doi]
AB  - Aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is complex and probably
      multifactorial. Nutrition has been proposed to be an important aetiological
      factor for development of IBD. Several components of the diet (such as sugar,
      fat, fibre, fruit and vegetable, protein, fast food, preservatives etc.) were
      examined as possible causative agents for IBD. According to some researchers
      infant feeding (breast feeding) may also contribute to the development of IBD.
      Though the importance of environmental factors is evidenced by the increasing
      incidence in developed countries and in migrant population in recent decades, the
      aetiology of IBD remained unclear. There are many theories, but as yet no dietary
      approaches have been proved to reduce the risk of developing IBD. The role of
      nutrition in the management of IBD is better understood. The prevention and
      correction of malnutrition, the provision of macro- and micronutrients and
      vitamins and the promotion of optimal growth and development of children are key 
      points of nutritional therapy. In active disease, the effective support of energy
      and nutrients is a very important part of the therapy. Natural and artificial
      nutrition or the combination of two can be chosen for supporting therapy of IBD. 
      The author summarises the aetiological and therapeutic role of nutrition in IBD.

PG  - S86-8

AB  - Nutrition plays a role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) primarily in
      prevention and treatment of malnutrition and growth failure. Furthermore, in
      Crohn disease (CD), nutrition can induce remission, maintain remission, and
      prevent relapse. Malnutrition is common in IBD and the mechanisms involved
      include decreased food intake, malabsorption, increased nutrient loss, increased 
      energy requirements, and drug-nutrient interactions. At the time of diagnosis, up
      to 85% of pediatric patients with CD and 65% of those with ulcerative colitis
      (UC) have weight loss. Growth failure occurs in 15% to 40% of children with IBD
      and is less common in UC compared with CD, both at diagnosis and during
      follow-up. In CD, nutritional therapy with enteral formulas induces remission at 
      a rate comparable with that achieved with steroids. In adults with CD, limited
      information suggests that enteral nutrition (EN) may play a role in maintenance
      of remission. In children with CD colitis, one study suggested that children
      without colitis respond better to EN than children with colitis, and another
      study found no such difference but reported a trend toward earlier relapse in
      those with isolated colonic involvement. Finally, nutrition may play a role in
      IBD via the possible protective effect of breastfeeding against UC and CD. In
      summary, although only CD may benefit from nutrition as primary therapy for
      remission induction and possibly maintenance of remission, nutrition plays an
      important role in the prevention and treatment of malnutrition in IBD, and may
      have a protective role, via the effect of breast-feeding on disease occurrence.

TI  - The vexed relationship between Clostridium difficile and inflammatory bowel
      disease: an assessment of carriage in an outpatient setting among patients in
      remission.
PG  - 1162-9
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2009.4 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Comorbidity with Clostridium difficile may cause diagnostic delay in 
      newly presenting inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, trigger relapse in
      established disease, confound therapies, and serve as an indicator of an
      underlying defect in innate immunity. Retrospective analyses have suggested
      community acquisition; to address this we conducted a prospective analysis of C. 
      difficile carriage in IBD patients using molecular methods specifically in an
      outpatient setting. METHODS: Recruited participants had long-standing diagnoses
      of ulcerative colitis (n = 64) and Crohn's disease (n = 58), were in clinical
      remission, and had no recent exposure to antibiotics, corticosteroids,
      immunomodulatory drugs or recent hospitalization. Isolates were cultured from
      stools and confirmed by 16S sequencing. The antibiotic susceptibilities of the
      isolates were tested followed by further strain characterization by toxinotyping,
      ribotyping, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). RESULTS: The frequency
      of toxigenic C. difficile was higher in IBD patients than in healthy volunteers
      at 8.2 and 1.0%, respectively (P = 0.02 Fisher's exact test). All strains
      belonged to toxinotype 0 with rare subtypes of this group noted in five isolates 
      and represented by an altered repressor genotype. Patients harbored a diverse
      range of toxigenic ribotype groups, including those previously associated with C.
      difficile-associated disease (CDAD) (R015, R005, and R020) and the rarer types
      R062, R050, and R003. Interestingly, common nosocomial groups were not
      identified. The considerable nonclonal distribution of distinct strains was
      further demonstrated by PFGE genomic fingerprinting. None of the study subjects
      experienced a clinical episode of CDAD during a 6-month period of follow-up.
      CONCLUSIONS: Detection of C. difficile is increased in IBD outpatients in
      remission, and strain diversity is consistent with community acquisition from a
      multitude of sources.

TI  - Alterations of taste perception in Crohn's disease and their dependency on
      disease activity and nutritional behavior.
PG  - 617-21
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0b013e31818acf91 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) is unknown. Besides
      immunoregulatory, genetic and environmental aspects, a nutritional impact is also
      encountered. Whether taste perception exerts any influence on an increased
      consumption of carbohydrates is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate nutritional
      habits and taste perception in CD patients, either in active or inactive disease 
      stages. DESIGN: A prospective study was performed with 31 active and 27 inactive 
      CD patients, and 30 age and sex-matched healthy subjects. Nutritional behavior
      was determined using an extensive optical nutrition questionnaire and taste
      perception was assessed by a 3-drop method with exceeding dilution tests.
      RESULTS: Active and inactive CD patients exhibited a significant increased taste 
      threshold for the detection of all solutions (bitter: P=0.0012; salty: P=0.0198; 
      sour: P=0.0021; and sweet: P=0.0208). For recognition, the determination of
      bitter solution (P=0.0014) was significantly reduced in CD patients compared with
      healthy subjects. No impact of clinical or objective parameters of inflammation
      on taste perception could be established. The consumption of refined sugar in CD 
      patients was higher than in healthy subjects, though not significant.
      CONCLUSIONS: An increased taste threshold for the detection of all 4 taste
      qualities in active and inactive CD patients suggests a systemic pathogenesis,
      such as an inflammation of the oral cavity, as a manifestation of CD. In this
      study, changes in taste threshold were not associated with altered sugar
      consumption.

LID - 10.1177/0884533608329298 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics are live microorganisms that produce a benefit to the host when
      provided in adequate amounts from food or supplements. There is an increased
      interest in the use of probiotics in the management and treatment of complex
      medical conditions. Recommendations for probiotic supplementation in the
      pediatric population are often conflicting due to limited research in many
      pediatric disease states. Research on single and multistrain probiotics has shown
      promise for some pediatric populations. This review discusses the research
      available for probiotic supplementation for children with irritable bowel
      syndrome, Crohn's disease, diarrhea, short bowel syndrome, human immunodeficiency
      virus, and food allergies. Probiotic safety also is discussed.

TI  - Comparison between handgrip strength, subjective global assessment,
      anthropometry, and biochemical markers in assessing nutritional status of
      patients with Crohn's disease in clinical remission.
PG  - 137-44

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Crohn's disease (CD) may lead to protein and calorie malnutrition
      (PCM) secondary to impaired digestive and absorptive functions of the small
      intestine and sometimes to the influence of diet taboos. The earlier the PCM is
      diagnosed, the higher are the odds of reversal. The objective of this study was
      to compare different methods of nutritional assessment in patients with CD and
      correlate them with the disease characteristics. SAMPLE: The sample comprised 75 
      patients with CD from the Gastroenterology Service at the Hospital de Clinicas de
      Porto Alegre; 37 were male, with a mean age of 38.2 years old (SD = 13.3). All
      patients had been in clinical remission (CDAI <150) for over 3 months. They were 
      not receiving enteral or parenteral nutrition. The nutritional assessment was
      considered: body mass index (BMI), triceps skin fold (TSF), arm circumference
      (MAC), arm muscle circumference (MAMC), subjective global assessment (SGA),
      non-dominating handgrip strength (HGS) and food intake inquiries. RESULTS: When
      comparing the different nutritional assessment methods, 26.7% of the patients
      were malnourished according to the MAC, 29.3% according to the MAMC, 18.7%
      according to the SGA, 6.7% according to the BMI, 37.3% according to the TSF and
      73.3% according to the HGS. No statistically significant associations were found 
      for disease location, its behavior, drugs utilized, ESR, CRP, age of patients and
      disease time with the nutritional state verified by HGS, TSF, MAMC and SGA.
      CONCLUSION: The prevalence of malnutrition is significant in patients with CD,
      even in clinical remission. The BMI should not be used as reference in this
      population. The HGS detected a high prevalence of nutritional risk in patients
      with CD in remission. Studies are required that correlate it with more sensitive 
      methods, for the patients' effective nutritional state assessment.

PG  - 103-9
LID - 10.1111/j.1445-5994.2008.01791.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactobacilli are used in an attempt to maintain remission for Crohn
      disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and adverse events of
      Lactobacilli compared with placebo in maintenance therapy for Crohn disease.
      METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register,
      OVID and BIOSIS. All randomized trials comparing Lactobacilli with placebo in
      maintenance therapy for Crohn disease were included. RESULTS: Six randomized
      controlled trials with a total of 359 participants met the inclusion criteria.
      From the meta-analyses, the relative risk (RR) of clinical relapse rate was 1.15 
      (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90-1.48) comparing Lactobacilli with placebo and 
      RR of endoscopic relapse rate was 1.31 (95%CI 0.57-3.00). Subgroup analyses
      showed RR for clinical relapse rates of Lactobacilli versus placebo was 0.99
      (95%CI 0.76-1.29) in adults, 1.85 (95%CI 1.00-3.41) in children, 1.68 (95%CI
      1.07-2.64) in Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG and 0.91 (95%CI 0.68-1.23) in
      Lactobacillus johnsonii respectively. The pooled RR of adverse events was 0.83
      (95%CI 0.61-1.12). CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis suggests that compared with
      placebo, administration of L. rhamnosus strain GG as maintenance therapy may
      increase the relapse rates of Crohn disease. L. johnsonii is inefficacious in
      reducing the incidence of relapse.

TI  - Lactococcus lactis as a live vector for mucosal delivery of therapeutic proteins.
PG  - 264-7
AB  - Food-grade lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have been safely consumed by humans for
      centuries in fermented foods. Lactococcus lactis, a LAB widely used in the dairy 
      industry as a starter, can be genetically engineered to efficiently produce a
      large variety of proteins. This feature has been recently exploited by scientists
      for the development of a new generation of vectors to deliver therapeutic
      proteins to the mucosal tissues. The successful Phase I clinical trial with a L. 
      lactis strain secreting interleukin-10 for Crohn's disease has opened new
      horizons for the use of genetically engineered LAB as delivery vehicles. This
      commentary reviews the current advances made with L. lactis as live vector for
      the mucosal delivery of therapeutic proteins.

TI  - Clinical relevance of measuring colonic permeability.
PG  - 139-44
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2362.2008.02075.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastroduodenal and small intestinal permeability are increased in
      patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and intensive care patients. The relevance of 
      colonic permeability has not yet been adequately investigated. The aim of this
      study was to investigate the clinical value of sucralose excretion as indicator
      for colonic permeability in these patient groups. DESIGN: After oral
      administration of four sugars and subsequent analysis of urinary excretion,
      gastroduodenal and intestinal permeability were calculated from saccharose
      excretion and lactulose/mannitol (L/M) ratio over 5 h, and sucralose excretion
      from 5 to 26 h in 100 healthy controls, 29 CD and 35 patients after coronary
      surgery (CABG). RESULTS: In controls, sucralose excretion was highly variable
      (0.67+/-0.92%) and not related to small intestinal permeability. In CD and CABG, 
      L/M ratio was increased (0.054+/-0.060; 0.323+/-0.253 vs. 0.018+/-0.001 in
      controls). Sucralose excretion was increased in 77% of CABG but only in 7% of CD.
      There was an association between gastroduodenal and intestinal permeability in CD
      and CABG (r=0.72, and r=0.51), but sucralose excretion was not related to either 
      one of these two parameters. Other than a weak association between sucralose and 
      length of stay in intensive care in CABG patients (P=0.099), sucralose excretion 
      was not related to clinical outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed cut-off for normal
      sucralose excretion is 2.11%, but its high variability and lack of association to
      gastrointestinal permeability or clinical outcome leave it open, if it can
      provide information beyond established permeability tests.

PG  - 605-14

AB  - BACKGROUND: Certolizumab pegol is the third anti-TNF-alpha agent approved by the 
      Food and Drug Administration of the United States. AIM: To provide a
      comprehensive up-to-date review of the efficacy and safety of certolizumab in
      Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: Electronic databases, including PubMed, EMBASE,
      the Cochrane library and the Science Citation Index, were searched to retrieve
      relevant trials. In addition, meeting abstracts and the reference lists of
      retrieved articles were reviewed for further relevant studies. RESULTS: Three
      trials, enrolling a total of 1040 patients, are included in the meta-analysis to 
      evaluate the short-term efficacy of certolizumab, which is effective for rapid
      induction and long-term maintenance of clinical response or remission and can
      improve quality of life in patients with Crohn's disease. Certolizumab is also
      effective for patients who have lost response to infliximab. However, its
      efficacy in infliximab-exposed patients is probably less than in infliximab-naive
      patients. Re-induction with certolizumab in patients who have flared on
      maintenance therapy can rescue a significant proportion of patients. There is no 
      significant association between the efficacy of certolizumab and the baseline
      C-reactive protein level. In comparison with placebo, certolizumab does not
      increase the risk of serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Certolizumab is
      effective and safe in treating Crohn's disease. Further studies are still
      required to assess its full safety profile.

PG  - 142-51

AB  - Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic inflammatory diseases of the
      intestinal tract commonly denoted as inflammatory bowel diseases. It has been
      proposed that these diseases result from aberrant mucosal immune responses to
      nonpathogenic microbial residents of the intestines. Recently, it was established
      that continuous interactions between the innate and the adaptive intestinal
      immune cells and the microbiota are directly involved in maintaining the
      physiological noninflammatory state of the intestinal mucosa. In light of the
      complexity of this mucosal homeostasis, it is astonishing that the inflammatory
      bowel diseases are relatively rare. Recently, altered functions of the innate
      immune system have been identified. As such, both hyperresponsiveness and
      hyporesponsiveness of innate cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of
      inflammatory bowel diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Environmental risk factors playing a causative role in Crohn's
      Disease (CD) remain largely unknown. Recently, it has been suggested that
      refrigerated food could be involved in disease development. We thus conducted a
      pilot case control study to explore the association of CD with the exposure to
      domestic refrigeration in childhood. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using a
      standard questionnaire we interviewed 199 CD cases and 207 age-matched patients
      with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) as controls. Cases and controls were followed
      by the same gastroenterologists of tertiary referral clinics in Tehran, Iran. The
      questionnaire focused on the date of the first acquisition of home refrigerator
      and freezer. Data were analysed by a multivariate logistic model. The current age
      was in average 34 years in CD cases and the percentage of females in the case and
      control groups were respectively 48.3% and 63.7%. Patients were exposed earlier
      than controls to the refrigerator (X2 = 9.9, df = 3, P = 0.04) and refrigerator
      exposure at birth was found to be a risk factor for CD (OR = 2.08 (95% CI:
      1.01-4.29), P = 0.05). Comparable results were obtained looking for the exposure 
      to freezer at home. Finally, among the other recorded items reflecting the
      hygiene and comfort at home, we also found personal television, car and washing
      machine associated with CD. CONCLUSION: This study supports the opinion that CD
      is associated with exposure to domestic refrigeration, among other household
      factors, during childhood.

TI  - Absence of infliximab in infants and breast milk from nursing mothers receiving
      therapy for Crohn's disease before and after delivery.
PG  - 613-6
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0b013e31817f9367 [doi]
AB  - GOALS: The objective of this study was to determine whether infliximab, an
      antitumor necrosis factor monoclonal antibody, is transferred in utero or through
      breast milk from nursing Crohn's disease patients to their newborns. BACKGROUND: 
      Crohn's disease most often occurs in women of childbearing age. Many of these
      women receive treatment for their disease, but are advised to terminate therapy
      while pregnant or nursing. STUDY: Three patients diagnosed with Crohn's disease
      who had a history of infliximab use during and after pregnancy were followed
      prospectively. Patients received 5-mg/kg infliximab at regular intervals until
      approximately gestational week 30, and resumed infliximab treatment within 3 to
      14 days after giving birth. Serum samples from patients and children and breast
      milk samples were collected postpartum. The concentration of infliximab in the
      serum and milk samples was measured using an enzyme-linked immmunosorbent assay. 
      RESULTS: The levels of infliximab detected in the mothers' serum samples
      postpartum were 74.27, 62.62, and 59.97 microg/mL, respectively. However,
      infliximab was undetectable (<0.10 microg/mL) in the sera of the newborn
      children. Likewise, infliximab was undetectable in the breast milk of the nursing
      mothers. CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab was detected in the mothers' sera, but not in
      the breast milk of nursing mothers or in the sera of the breast-fed newborns.
      Data from this small series of patients suggest that infliximab was not
      transferred from mother to child, either in utero or through breast milk. These
      data suggest that mothers receiving infliximab should not be discouraged from
      nursing their children.

TI  - Folate concentrations in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed inflammatory
      bowel disease.
PG  - 545-50
LID - 10.3945/ajcn.2008.26576 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Folate is postulated to protect against cell injury and long-term
      risk of cancer. Folate deficiency has been shown to be associated with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, folate concentrations are poorly
      delineated in children with IBD. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare folate
      concentrations between children with newly diagnosed IBD and healthy controls.
      DESIGN: Red blood cell folate (RBCF) and whole-blood folate (WBF) concentrations 
      were measured in 78 children (mean age: 12.8 +/- 2.7 y): 22 patients with newly
      diagnosed untreated Crohn disease, 11 patients with ulcerative colitis, 4
      patients with indeterminate colitis, and 41 controls. Vitamin supplementation and
      dietary intakes determined by food-frequency questionnaire were recorded for 20
      IBD patients and 28 controls. RESULTS: RBCF concentrations were 19.4% lower in
      controls (587.0 +/- 148.6 ng/mL) than in patients (728.7 +/- 185.8 ng/mL; P =
      0.0004), and WBF concentrations were 11.1% lower in controls (218.2 +/- 49.7
      ng/mL) than in patients (245.3 +/- 59.1 ng/mL; P = 0.031). Total folate intake
      was 18.8% higher in controls (444.7 +/- 266.7 microg/d) than in IBD patients
      (361.1 +/- 230.6 microg/d), but this difference was not statistically significant
      (P = 0.264). Folate intakes were below the Recommended Dietary Allowance (200-400
      microg/d), adjusted for age and sex, in 35.4% of study subjects. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      contrast with previous evidence of folate deficiency in adult IBD patients, our
      data indicate higher folate concentrations in children with newly diagnosed
      untreated IBD than in controls. This finding was unexpected, especially in light 
      of the higher dietary folate intakes and hematocrit values in children without
      IBD. The influence of IBD therapy on folate metabolism and the long-term clinical
      implications of high RBCF and WBF concentrations at the time of IBD diagnosis
      should be explored further.

TI  - Probiotics for inflammatory bowel disease: a critical appraisal.
PG  - 111-4
LID - 10.1159/000268130 [doi]
AB  - The notion that the intestinal microbiota plays a key role for the development of
      intestinal inflammation, initially based on a series of clinical observations
      both in human inflammatory bowel disease and experimental colitis, has been
      reinforced by a growing body of evidence demonstrating that the abnormal
      recognition of bacterial and other microbiota antigens by the innate immune
      system is one of the earliest events in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel
      disease. In keeping with our present knowledge of inflammatory bowel disease
      pathophysiology, the search for therapeutic approaches aimed at modifying the
      composition of the intestinal microbiota to obtain new, more targeted treatments 
      for inflammatory bowel disease that are basically free of side effects has been a
      subject of intense research activity. Probiotics are defined as live organisms
      capable of conferring health benefits beyond their nutritional properties.
      Numerous micro-organisms have been evaluated to induce or maintain remission, or 
      both, in ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and pouchitis. Overall, probiotics
      have successfully demonstrated some efficacy in some inflammatory bowel disease
      scenarios. However, a critical review of the available scientific literature
      shows that: (1) in spite of great expectations, reflected by a high number of
      review and editorial articles in top journals, the number of published,
      well-designed clinical trials using probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease is
      small, often with few patients; (2) the range of microbial agents makes it
      particularly difficult to draw global conclusions; (3) the quality of the
      evidence on the efficacy of probiotics in pouchitis is clearly better than that
      in ulcerative colitis, while there is virtually no evidence of probiotic efficacy
      in Crohn's disease. The appropriate selection of probiotic agents combined with
      convincing clinical trials will determine whether probiotics can jump from
      promise to reality in inflammatory bowel disease clinical practice.

      and prognosis of Crohn's disease (CD) patients, but the diagnostic accuracy of
      the activity indices has not yet been established. The aim of this study was to
      determine the accuracy and agreement of the Fistula Drainage Assessment (FDA),
      Perianal Disease Activity Index (PDAI), and computer-assisted anal ultrasound
      imaging (AUS). METHODS: Sixty-two consecutive patients with CD and perianal
      fistulae underwent clinical, FDA, PDAI, and AUS evaluation. Perianal disease was 
      considered active in the presence of visible fistula drainage and/or signs of
      local inflammation (induration and pain at digital compression) upon clinical
      examination. The AUS images were analyzed by calculating the mean gray-scale tone
      of the lesion. The PDAI and gray-scale tone values discriminating active and
      inactive perianal disease were defined using receiver operating characteristics
      statistics. RESULTS: Perianal disease was active in 46 patients. The accuracy of 
      the FDA was 87% (confidence interval [CI]: 76%-94%). A PDAI of >4 and a mean
      gray-scale tone value of 117 maximized sensitivity and specificity; their
      diagnostic accuracy was, respectively, 87% (CI: 76%-94%) and 81% (CI: 69%-90%).
      The agreement of the 3 evaluations was fair to moderate. The addition of AUS to
      the PDAI or FDA increased their diagnostic accuracy to respectively 95% and 98%. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic accuracy of the FDA, PDAI, and computer-assisted AUS 
      imaging was good in assessing perianal disease activity in patients with CD. The 
      agreement between the techniques was fair to moderate. Overall accuracy can be
      increased by combining the FDA or PDAI with AUS.

TI  - Quality of life of patients and medical cost of "half elemental diet" as
      maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease: secondary outcomes of a randomised
      controlled trial.
PG  - 390-4
LID - 10.1016/j.dld.2008.09.007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Quality of life (QOL) of the patients and medical costs are
      important in current medical treatments, especially those for chronic diseases.
      We have reported the effectiveness of 'half elemental diet (ED)' as maintenance
      therapy for patients with Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this study was to
      evaluate the QOL of CD patients and medical costs of half-ED. METHODS: Fifty-one 
      CD patients in remission were randomly assigned to a half-ED group (n=26) or a
      free diet group (n=25). The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of relapse
      during a 2-year period. This time, we investigated the QOL of the patients and
      medical costs of half-ED, as secondary outcomes. QOL was evaluated using the
      Japanese version of the IBDQ scoring system, and medical costs were calculated
      monthly from the receipts. RESULTS: IBDQ score was not significantly different
      between the two groups at 1 and 13 months after the start of maintenance
      treatment. Medical costs were not significantly different between them either.
      This study showed that half-ED therapy did not affect the treatment of CD
      patients, neither regarding their QOL nor medical costs. CONCLUSION: This study
      has confirmed this half-ED therapy is beneficial for patients with Crohn's
      disease.

TI  - High prevalence of vitamin K and D deficiency and decreased BMD in inflammatory
      bowel disease.
PG  - 935-42
LID - 10.1007/s00198-008-0764-2 [doi]
AB  - SUMMARY: Vitamin K and D deficiency and decreased bone mineral density (BMD) were
      highly prevalent in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially
      Crohn's disease (CD). Dietary intakes of these vitamins, however, were above the 
      Japanese adequate intakes in IBD patients, suggesting that malabsorption is the
      basis for hypovitaminosis K and D and decreased BMD. INTRODUCTION: We have
      studied the possible involvement of vitamin K and D deficiency in the
      pathogenesis of decreased BMD in IBD. METHODS: Seventy patients with IBD were
      evaluated for their BMD; plasma levels of vitamin K; phylloquinone (PK),
      menaquinone-7 (MK-7), and 25OH-D; serum PTH, protein induced by vitamin K absence
      (PIVKA-II), and undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) levels; and their food
      intake. RESULTS: Compared with ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, CD patients had 
      significantly lower plasma vitamin K and 25OH-D concentrations; significantly
      higher serum levels of PTH, PIVKA-II, and ucOC; and significantly lower BMD
      scores at almost all measurement sites. More IBD patients were vitamin K
      deficient in bone than in liver. Multiple regression analyses revealed that low
      plasma concentrations of vitamin K and 25OH-D were independent risk factors for
      low BMD and that they were associated with the patients' fat intake, but not with
      their intake of these vitamins. CONCLUSION: IBD patients have high prevalence of 
      decreased BMD and vitamin K and D deficiency probably caused by malabsorption of 
      these vitamins.

TI  - Positive impact of blocking tumor necrosis factor alpha on the nutritional status
      in pediatric Crohn's disease patients.
PG  - 19-25
LID - 10.1007/s00384-008-0578-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: TNFalpha seems to contribute to inflammation and malnutrition in
      Crohn's disease (CD) patients. In CD patients, the comparative effects on
      nutritional status of infliximab and traditional therapy have not yet been
      determined. The aim of our study was to assess the effects of infliximab as
      compared with those of standard therapy on nutritional status, disease activity, 
      resting energy expenditure (REE), and food intake in CD children and adolescents.
      METHODS: From September 1999 to September 2005, all CD patients treated with
      infliximab (group A) were reviewed and matched with CD patients treated with
      traditional therapy (mesalazine and azathioprine) (group B). RESULTS: Fourteen CD
      patients from group A and 14 from group B were included; median interval before
      follow-up investigation was 10 months. Baseline and final values of weight,
      height, body mass index (BMI), pediatric CD activity index (pCDAI), REE, and food
      intake were studied. In treated patients, but not in control group, mean baseline
      weight (kg) and BMI values, 39.7 +/- 13.1 and 17.9 +/- 3.3, respectively, were
      significantly lower than their final values 42.6 +/- 13.2 and 18.9 +/- 3.1, and
      median pCDAI values 23.5 were significantly higher than their final values 10 (P 
      < 0.05). Significant changes in height, REE, and food intake were not found in
      either group. CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric CD patients, infliximab seems to impact
      positively on the nutritional status as demonstrated by the improvement in weight
      and BMI, but not in linear growth; effects on nutritional status seem to be due
      to amelioration of disease activity, rather than to REE reduction or food intake 
      increase.

PG  - 83-9

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ghrelin, a potent orexigenic peptide produced by the stomach, may be 
      affected by circulating inflammatory mediators. AIM: To assess the effect of an
      anti-TNFalpha antibody on ghrelin in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS:
      Fifteen patients with Crohn's receiving infliximab were studied before and 1 week
      after infusion. Following an overnight fast, blood was sampled before a meal and 
      then every 20 min for 2 h. Total ghrelin and CRP were measured using ELISA.
      Acylated ghrelin and TNFalpha, IFNgamma, IL-1beta and IL-6 were measured with
      bioplex. Harvey Bradshaw Activity Index was assessed. RESULTS: Median (95% CI)
      2-h integrated plasma total ghrelin increased from 162 (99-311) before infliximab
      to 200 (128-387) pg/mL h, (P = 0.02) after. Following infliximab, 20 min
      postmeal, median acylated ghrelin decreased from 50.3 (24-64) to 38.6 (26-82)
      pg/mL, (P = 0.04) thus reverting to a traditional meal related ghrelin curve.
      Median (range) disease activity decreased from 5 (2-28) before to 3 (0-22), (P = 
      0.0001) and Median (95% CI) TNFalpha decreased from 2.8 (1.89-4.48) to 1.31
      (0.73-2.06) pg/mL (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab increases circulating
      total ghrelin by 25% in CD and restores the postprandial response of acylated
      ghrelin to food intake. Acylated and de-sacyl ghrelin remain unchanged,
      suggesting that an alternate isoform could be affected by infliximab.

TI  - Peripheral cytokine profile in Chilean patients with Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 33-8
LID - 10.1684/ecn.2009.0142 [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) belong to the group of
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), with complex ethiopathogenic factors that
      include an unbalanced immune and inflammatory response to commensal and food
      antigens. The differential diagnosis between CD and UC is performed using
      clinical, endoscopic, histopathological, serological and radiological methods;
      however between 10-15% of IBD patients are diagnosed as "unclassified colitis".
      Further research into IBD is necessary in order to develop additional diagnostic 
      tools. The aim of this work was to see if the Th1, Th17 or Th2 immune pattern,
      represented by CD4+ lymphocytes producing IFN-gamma, IL-17 and IL-5 or IL-13,
      respectively (CD4/IFN-gamma+, CD4/IL-17+,CD4/IL-5+ or, CD4/IL13+), are useful
      peripheral markers which can be used to differentiate between UC and CD.
      Peripheral blood samples were taken from IBD patients from the Clinic Hospital of
      the University of Chile. The percentage of IFN-gamma-, IL-17-, IL-5- or
      IL-13-expressing CD4+ cells was determined by flow cytometry in phorbol ester-
      (PMA) and calcymycin-activated blood samples. The percentages of the CD4+ cell
      populations producing each cytokine were compared between UC and CD. IFN-gamma
      production by CD4+ lymphocytes was significantly higher in CD compared to UC and 
      the control. The percentage of IL-17-expressing cells was significantly higher in
      CD patients compared to to the control; however, there were no differences
      between UC and CD; or between UC and healthy individuals. No significant
      differences were observed between the different groups as regards the
      representative Th2 cytokines. This study suggests that, under pathogenic
      conditions, several immune profiles may be operating, in the development of IBD. 
      Although peripheral IFN-gamma and IL-17 expression, as indicators of the immune
      pattern, may help in the diagnosis of IBD, other cytokines and adaptive immune
      markers should be analyzed to allow better differentiation between the two
      entities.
