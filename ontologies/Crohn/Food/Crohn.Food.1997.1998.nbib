TI  - Modulation of intestinal immune system by dietary fat intake: relevance to
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1183-90
AB  - Gut-associated lymphoid tissue is the major inductive site of the mucosal immune 
      system, which is functionally independent of the systemic immune system. Both the
      amount and type of dietary fat modulate intestinal immune function. Absorption of
      long-chain fatty acids stimulates lymphocyte flux and lymphocyte blastogenesis in
      intestinal lymphatics. Long-chain fatty acid absorption also significantly
      enhances migration of T lymphocytes to Peyer's patches, possibly due to
      up-regulation of adhesion molecules, such as alpha4-integrin and L-selectin.
      Lipoproteins are involved in stimulation of lymphocyte function by both
      receptor-dependent and independent mechanisms. However, unsaturated fatty acids
      at higher concentrations have a suppressive effect on cell-mediated immunity via 
      eicosanoid release, receptor affinity changes or interactions with intracellular 
      signal transduction. Fat absorption also influences various other cells in the
      intestinal mucosa: increased cytokine release from intestinal epithelial cells
      follows long-chain fatty acid absorption. In Crohn's disease, elemental diets and
      total parenteral nutrition often induce remission, possibly by reducing antigenic
      load on activated immune cells in the intestine and, thus, down-regulating
      hyperreactive CD4 cells. Dietary oleic acid supplements caused an immunological
      reversal effect in the intestinal immune system of animals fed an elemental diet.
      An excess of long-chain fatty acids in an elemental diet, therefore, may negate
      its beneficial effect on gut-associated lymphoid tissues in Crohn's disease. In
      contrast, supplemental dietary fish oil apparently tends to prevent relapse of
      Crohn's disease. Because dietary fat intake is closely associated with
      immunological function of the intestinal mucosa, careful manipulation of dietary 
      fat can be important in management of this disease.

TI  - [Enteral nutrition in acute Crohn disease].
PG  - 983-95
AB  - High-dose corticosteroids remain the gold standard of therapy in acute Crohn's
      disease, but is associated with a variety of side effects. Nutritional therapy
      could be an interesting alternative, but corticosteroids are meant to be
      significantly superior according to efficacy. Published studies, identified by
      references, MEDLINE and meta-analysis, were evaluated for efficacy of nutritional
      therapy in acute Crohn's disease. In 18 evaluable of 38 identified publications, 
      571 patients were treated with nutritional therapy: 295 received elemental diet, 
      214 oligopeptide diet and 62 polymeric diet. Remission rates were 60%, 55% and
      66% respectively. However, only intention-to-treat-analysis was performed in all 
      the studies. When correcting for patients who really were treated with
      nutritional therapy, remission rates were substantially better: 73%, 70% and 67% 
      respectively, thus comparable with that of corticosteroids. Positive predictors
      for successful treatment were stenosing disease and low ESR. Remission seems to
      last as long as after corticosteroid treatment, when a reinduction diet is
      performed. Negative aspects of nutritional therapy are poor tolerance and higher 
      costs. Perspectives for the future aim on broadening of indications, improving
      acceptance (by adjuvant instead of exclusive nutrition, or new flavors) and
      efficacy by modification of compounds (such as glutamine, omega-3 fatty acids or 
      trace elements) or combination with other therapeutic agents (e.g., mesalamine).

PG  - 1212-21
AB  - We performed randomized controlled study to compare the short-term therapeutic
      effect of total parenteral nutrition (TPN), elemental diet (ED) and polymeric
      diet (PD) given as primary therapy in active phase of Crohn's disease. In
      hospital for Crohn's disease, twenty-eight patients were given nutritional
      therapy: 9 patients by TPN, 10 by ED, and 9 by PD. Nutritional state,
      inflammatory reactions, disease activity and clinical remission rate were
      assessed two weeks and four weeks after treatment, and morphological findings
      were assessed before and after each nutritional therapy by radiographic and
      colonoscopic findings. Inflammatory reactions were more effectively controlled by
      TPN and ED than by PD, and early improvement achieved by TPN and ED was
      especially note-worthy. Clinical remission rate after treatment by TPN was
      highest in three types of nutritional approach, but no significant difference was
      seen at any point. In nutritional state, disease activity and morphological
      findings, comparable changes were effected without preference. These results
      suggest that nutritional therapy by total parenteral nutrition and elemental diet
      is superior to polymeric diet for treating active phase of Crohn's disease with
      marked inflammatory reactions.

TI  - Human exposure to Mycobacterium paratuberculosis via pasteurised milk: a
      modelling approach.
PG  - 293-6
AB  - Paratuberculosis is a disease of cattle caused by infection with Mycobacterium
      paratuberculosis, and it has been suggested that this bacterium may also play a
      role in the aetiology of Crohn's disease in humans. M paratuberculosis is shed in
      the milk and may be able to survive pasteurisation. Therefore, people may be
      exposed to it by the consumption of pasteurised milk. The risk of such exposure
      has been analysed using a modelling approach and the model has been used to
      evaluate the effects of intervention measures at different points in the
      potential route of transmission. On the basis of data from the literature and
      expert opinion, an initial point estimate of the exposure level of about 0-5
      cfu/litre pasteurised milk was derived, mainly due to milk from clinically
      affected animals. The model indicates the need for quantitative data on
      variations in the shedding rates of M paratuberculosis in faeces and milk, and
      the levels of faecal contamination of milk. Such data are essential for a proper 
      analysis of potential exposure, and may result in a 100-fold increase in the
      estimated median level of exposure.

TI  - Chemoprevention of colorectal cancer in inflammatory bowel disease? A potential
      role for folate.
PG  - 421-5
AB  - Patients with ulcerative colitis have an increased risk for developing colon
      cancer compared to the general population. The risk is related to the extension
      of the disease and its duration. This risk is the same for Crohn's colitis
      patients of equal extension and duration. By chemoprevention we mean the use of
      specific natural or synthetic chemical agents to reverse, suppress or prevent
      progression to invasive cancer. The chemopreventive agents for colon cancer are
      either of natural origin (vitamins, minerals, food constituents) or synthetic
      chemicals (difluoromethyl ornithine) and pharmaceutical agents (aspirin,
      oltipraz). Apart from folate, no other agent has so far been used in vivo for the
      prevention of colon cancer in long-standing inflammatory bowel disease. The use
      of folate was, however, not primarily intended to prevent cancer but to enhance
      folate absorption in ulcerative colitis. From retrospective studies, within the
      framework of cancer surveillance programmes, it became evident that folate
      supplementation may play a positive role as a chemopreventive agent against
      colorectal cancer in patients with long-standing, extensive ulcerative colitis.
      There is also evidence suggesting that folate supplementation may contribute to
      regulation of rectal cell proliferation in ulcerative colitis patients. There is 
      a real need for multicentre, randomized, prospective clinical studies in order to
      evaluate the promising role of folate in preventing colorectal cancer in patients
      with long-standing inflammatory bowel disease.

AB  - Many nutritional issues are important in the care of children and adolescents
      with inflammatory bowel disease. No specific dietary toxin or antigen has been
      identified to have an etiologic role in either ulcerative colitis or Crohn's
      disease. A possible modulating effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on
      intestinal inflammation is being investigated. Most prevalent among the
      nutritional consequences of inflammatory bowel disease is weight loss, for which 
      inadequate caloric intake is primarily responsible. Impairment of linear growth
      and associated delay in pubertal development commonly complicate childhood
      Crohn's disease. The two major etiologic factors are chronic undernutrition and
      direct effects of inflammatory mediators secreted from the inflamed gut. Recent
      studies have incriminated interleukin-6. Treatment of intestinal inflammation and
      provision of adequate nutrition are of paramount importance in preventing or
      remedying growth impairment. Exclusive enteral nutrition using formulated food is
      efficacious primary therapy of active Crohn's disease, although the mode of
      action is poorly understood.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of the viscous, high-molecular-mass microbial
      carbohydrate fraction from faeces of healthy subjects and patients with Crohn's
      disease and the consequences for a therapeutic approach.
PG  - 425-33
AB  - 1. An earlier study by our group revealed that the viscosity of faeces from
      patients with Crohn's disease is significantly lower than that of healthy
      subjects. This is due to low concentrations of a high-molecular-mass
      carbohydrate, probably of bacterial origin. The cause of this phenomenon might be
      the impaired barrier function of the gut mucosa. Low viscosity may allow close
      contact of intestinal contents (bacterial products and toxins) with the
      intestinal wall. This could play a role in the maintenance of the disease.2. The 
      first aim of this study was to investigate the high-molecular-mass carbohydrate
      fraction, responsible for viscosity, in detail. We also tried (in a pilot study) 
      to raise the intestinal viscosity of patients with Crohn's disease with the
      undegradable food additive hydroxypropylcellulose (E463), in an attempt to
      alleviate clinical symptoms.3. The high-molecular-mass fraction (>300 kDa)
      responsible for faecal viscosity was sensitive to lysozyme and contained high
      levels of muramic acid. It was concluded that this material consisted mainly of
      peptidoglycan polysaccharides and was consequently of bacterial origin. The
      muramic acid in material from patients with Crohn's disease was 7.5 (1.5-13.9)%, 
      which was less than in healthy subjects [11.4 (8.5-24.1)%; P=0.0004].
      Furthermore, viscosity in material from patients with Crohn's disease was found
      to be half [14.9 (1.0-33.6) cP] of that found in healthy subjects [35.0
      (2.7-90.7) cP; P=0.004].4.A daily dose of 1 g of hydroxypropylcellulose caused an
      increase in faecal viscosity in patients with Crohn's disease (from 1.4 to 2.3
      cP) and in healthy subjects (from 4.9 to 7.5 cP). Faecal consistency improved in 
      patients with Crohn's disease (from watery and loose to formed) and the
      defecation frequency decreased from 3-4 to about 2 times a day. No changes in
      defecation patterns were found in healthy subjects.5. These data indicate that
      the high-molecular-mass fraction that is responsible for faecal viscosity is
      peptidoglycan. Furthermore, a daily dose of a hydroxypropylcellulose solution to 
      increase the viscosity of the intestinal contents of patients with Crohn's
      disease might be beneficial. This approach merits further study.

TI  - Assessment of the role and reliability of sonographic post-prandial flow response
      in grading Crohn's disease activity.
PG  - 599-603
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the value of pre and post prandial Duplex colour Doppler 
      sonographic (DCDS) measurement of superior mesenteric artery (SMA) flow in the
      assessment of Crohn's disease activity, and its response to treatment. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: SMA volume flow rates before and after a food challenge (200 ml of
      Ensure Plus) were recorded over 60 min in 11 controls, and 25 patients with
      proven Crohn's disease. Peak flow rates and the time interval to peak flow were
      recorded. Eleven patients with active disease were monitored longitudinally and
      their response following the introduction of systemic steroids was assessed.
      RESULTS: The time interval from food challenge to peak SMA flow rate was
      significantly lower in patients with untreated active disease (median 20 min,
      range 14.5-21.25) compared to inactive patients (median 33 mins, range
      28.75-40.5, P = 0.0006). Longitudinal follow-up of active disease demonstrated
      prolongation of time to peak flow following clinical remission (P = 0.0024)
      CONCLUSIONS: This technique is useful in offering an immediate, noninvasive means
      of assessing disease activity. Further longitudinal follow up data is necessary
      to determine its utility in assessing response to treatment.

TI  - Modern life' in the epidemiology of inflammatory bowel disease: a case-control
      study with special emphasis on nutritional factors.
PG  - 243-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The rising incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) since the
      Second World War coincides with profound changes of the dietary pattern. The aim 
      of the study was to investigate the possible pathogenic role of some
      characteristic 'modern life' dietary factors in IBD. DESIGN: Case-control,
      studying risk factors in recently diagnosed cases, 290 with Crohn's disease and
      398 with ulcerative colitis, compared with 616 population controls. Smoking, age,
      gender and education were taken into account by using logistic regression
      analysis. SETTING: Hospital cases and population controls. INTERVENTIONS:
      Questionnaires. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Logistic regression-derived odds ratios.
      RESULTS: A positive association with cola drinks [OR: 2.2 (95% CI 1.5-3.1)],
      chewing gum [OR: 1.5 (95% CI: 1.1-2.1)] and chocolate consumption [OR: 2.5 (95%
      CI: 1.8-3.5)] and a negative association with citrus fruit consumption [OR: 0.5
      (95% CI 0.3-0.7)] and the development of Crohn's disease were found. Consumption 
      of cola drinks [OR: 1.6 (95% CI 1.1-2.3)] and chocolate consumption [OR: 2.5 (95%
      CI 1.8-3.5)] were positively associated with developing ulcerative colitis. There
      was a negative association between the intake of citrus fruits [OR: 0.5 (95% CI
      0.4-0.8)] and 'having a stuffed pet' for a period longer than 5 years [OR: 0.6
      (95% CI 0.4-0.9)] and developing the disorder. No association with the frequency 
      of tooth brushing and developing IBD was found. CONCLUSION: All the nutritional
      items mentioned may be true risk factors or they just might be the expression of 
      a modern life-style also involving other risk factors for the development of IBD 
      which at the present are still unknown.

TI  - Nutritional factors in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 235-7
AB  - During the past 20 years there has been growing interest in the importance of
      nutritional factors in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. There are 
      so far no definite links between ulcerative colitis and diet, but links with
      Crohn's disease have been studied by both epidemiologists and clinicians.
      Epidemiological studies, although retrospective, have suggested that patients
      with Crohn's disease eat more sugar and sweets that control individuals; however,
      when dietary sugar is restricted, there is little clinical benefit. The clinical 
      approach to nutrition in Crohn's disease has been by the use of elemental diets, 
      which will produce symptomatic and objective remission in up to 90% of compliant 
      patients. Those who return to normal eating soon relapse but, in some studies,
      have enjoyed prolonged remission on exclusion diets. The foods excluded have been
      not sugar, but predominantly cereals, dairy products and yeast. Attention has now
      switched to the possible harmful role of fat in Crohn's disease. The efficacy of 
      elemental feeds appears to depend not on the presentation of nitrogen but on the 
      amount of long chain triglyceride present. Increases in recent years in the
      frequency of Crohn's disease in Japan have been correlated with increased dietary
      fat intake, and a recent study suggested that W-3 fatty acids, which are
      metabolized by immunomodulatory leukotrienes and prostaglandins, may have a
      beneficial role to play. The links between nutrition and Crohn's disease have now
      become strong and the role of fat may be the most exciting of all.

TI  - [Inflammatory bowel disease: importance of nutrition today].
PG  - 289-98
AB  - Malnutrition is a very common situation in patients inflammatory with intestinal 
      disease (IID), which can be caused by a multitude of factors. It has been shown
      that nutritional support not only improves the nutritional condition of the
      patients, but in Crohn's disease it also has an effect on the activity of the
      disease, although this effect is smaller than that of steroids. Elemental diets
      are no more efficient than polymeric diets except under very special
      circumstances, but they are more expensive and patients tolerate them worse. A
      digestive pause is not recommended unless there is an absolute contraindication
      for the use of the digestive tract. Therefore, parenteral nutrition, which is
      more expensive and can cause serious complications, will be reserved for very
      specific indications. The use of fish oil supplements, either because it competes
      with arachidonic acid and prevents the initiation of the inflammatory cascade, or
      because it decreases the production of cytokines, has shown to be potentially
      useful in inflammatory intestinal disease, and this must be confirmed by further 
      studies. Short chain fatty acids enemas have shown promising results in distal
      ulcerative colitis but the lack of homogeneity in the studies makes it necessary 
      for these results to be consolidated in new studies. Nutritional support is
      especially interesting in children with inflammatory intestinal disease given
      that the growth retardation which is often seen in severe cases, can be
      controlled by adequate enteral or parenteral diets.

TI  - A review of associations between Crohn's disease and consumption of sugars.
PG  - 229-38
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To critically review the available literature reporting associations 
      between the onset of Crohn's disease and intakes of sugars or sugar-containing
      foods. To evaluate published evidence on the use of dietary manipulation of
      sugars in the treatment of Crohn's disease. DESIGN: All publications from
      refereed journals which reported intakes of sugars and sugar-containing foods in 
      the context of Crohn's disease onset or treatment were selected. CONCLUSION:
      Evidence suggesting a relationship between sugars and onset of Crohn's disease
      was inconsistent and subject to important methodological limitations. There was a
      clear lack of distinction between reporting of current, as opposed to,
      retrospective intakes. There appeared to be no clinical advantage to the use of
      reduced sugar diets in Crohn's disease treatment.

TI  - [Analysis of sudden death caused by intestinal obstruction].
PG  - 423-9
AB  - Five autopsy cases of sudden death caused by intestinal obstruction are reported.
      The causes of death of the cases were duodenal obstruction of impacted food
      stuff, ileocaecal obstruction caused by Crohn's disease, incarceration of
      inguinal hernia, intestinal obstruction caused by heterotopic pancreas and
      paralytic ileus. In three cases, the patient was in cardiopulmonary arrest on
      arrival at hospital, and in the remaining cases the patient died within 12 hours 
      from the beginning of treatment; therefore, a correct clinical diagnosis was not 
      made before the death in all cases. All the patients had from one to three days
      history of nausea and abdominal pain, major complications of intestinal
      obstruction. Among all cases, the duration from the onset to death was the
      shortest in the case of a patient complicated with schizophrenia. It is
      characteristic that the patients of all cases died suddenly and resuscitation was
      not successful. Regarding the laboratory data of a hospitalized patient, marked
      hemoconcentration and an increased level of BUN/Cr ratio and blood sugar were
      shown. The patient who died from duodenal obstruction caused by impacted
      food-stuff had suffered from depression for six years, and the patient who died
      from paralytic ileus had suffered from schizophrenia for about 23 years. In both 
      cases, it is characteristic that the complaints of the patient were poorer than
      what would be expected. Furthermore, these patients had been taking medication of
      psychotic, anti-depressant and anti-parkinsonism drugs; therefore the combination
      of these drugs was thought to be reflected in the bowel movement.

      diseases].
PG  - 6-10
AB  - BACKGROUND: Deficiencies of vitamins and trace elements are frequent in
      inflammatory bowel disease. Aim of this study was to evaluate retrospectively the
      prevalence of these deficiencies and of liver complications in a large
      population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The records from 392 out-patients, 279 with
      Crohn's disease (160 female, 119 male) and 113 with ulcerative colitis (56
      female, 57 male) were analyzed. RESULTS: Deficiencies were found in 85% of
      patients with Crohn's disease vs 68% with ulcerative colitis during the course of
      the disease, predominantly a deficiency of iron and of calcium. Less frequently
      deficiencies of zinc, protein, cyanocobalamin, and folic acid were found.
      Elevated liver enzymes were seen in 38% of patients with Crohn's disease vs 27%
      with ulcerative colitis. In order of frequency: gamma-glutamyl-transferase, ALAT,
      AP, ASAT, and bilirubin. Gallstones were present in 12% of patients with Crohn's 
      disease and 4% with ulcerative colitis. 6% of patients with Crohn's disease and
      4% with ulcerative colitis had kidney stones. CONCLUSIONS: In view of the high
      frequency of deficiencies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease it seems to
      be important to check frequently for extraintestinal complications.

TI  - Severe muscle damage induced by high carbohydrate intake from elemental diet in a
      patient with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 121-4
AB  - Crohn's disease is associated with complications in multiple organs. However,
      there are very few reported cases of patients with Crohn's disease with muscle
      symptoms and/or high serum creatine phospho-kinase (CPK) levels. We report here a
      patient with Crohn's disease who experienced skeletal muscle damage with
      extremely high serum CPK level during treatment with an elemental diet. The
      non-parenteral administration of large amounts of carbohydrate and limited
      glycogen degradation capability may be a possible causative mechanism for this
      elemental diet-induced muscle damage.

TI  - Twenty-four-hour energy balance in Crohn disease patients: metabolic implications
      of steroid treatment.
PG  - 118-23
AB  - Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the nutritional deficiencies
      seen in Crohn disease patients, including inadequate food intake, decreased
      assimilation and increased loss of nutrients, and increased energy expenditure.
      To assess the effect of steroid therapy on body composition, energy expenditure, 
      and fuel selection in Crohn disease, we compared 12 patients (6 men and 6 women) 
      with biopsy-proven ileal Crohn disease with 11 healthy volunteers (6 men and 5
      women). Five patients [Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) = 98.4 +/- 3.78]
      took no medication and seven patients (CDAI = 283.9 +/- 22.5) were administered
      29 +/- 18 mg prednisone/d. Body composition was evaluated by isotopic dilution
      and bioelectrical impedance analysis, and 24-h energy expenditure and basal
      metabolic rate were measured in a respiratory chamber. Fat-free mass was not
      significantly different among groups, whereas fat mass was lower in patients than
      in control subjects. Energy intake was higher in treated patients than in both
      untreated patients (P = 0.004) and control subjects (P = 0.005). Fecal losses
      were not significantly different between untreated patients and control subjects,
      but were higher (and proportional to the CDAI) in treated patients than in
      control subjects (P = 0.001). Metabolizable energy was not significantly
      different among groups, whereas energy balance was significantly higher in
      treated patients than in both control subjects (P = 0.0057) and untreated
      patients (P = 0.018). Nitrogen balance was mildly negative in treated patients
      compared with both control subjects and untreated patients, but not significantly
      so. In conclusion, prednisone treatment in Crohn disease patients stimulates food
      intake, promoting an overall positive energy balance despite large fecal nutrient
      losses.

TI  - Mycobacterium paratuberculosis: a potential food-borne pathogen?
PG  - 3445-8
AB  - Mycobacterium paratuberculosis commonly infects dairy cattle, leading to Johne's 
      disease, which is also known as paratuberculosis. The infection is chronic
      progressive, and incurable. As the infection progresses, excretion of M.
      paratuberculosis in feces and milk occurs, and the bacterium spreads through the 
      blood to multiple internal organs. Consequently, raw products originating from
      cattle may harbor M. paratuberculosis. Thermal treatments, such as
      pasteurization, are commonly relied on to kill food-borne bacterial pathogens
      that can infect humans. The small number of studies conducted to determine the
      thermal resistance of M. paratuberculosis suggest that it is less susceptible to 
      destruction by heat killing than are milkborne zoonotic bacterial pathogens such 
      as Listeria spp. or Mycobacterium bovis. Published reports concerning the thermal
      resistance of M. paratuberculosis in milk are reviewed herein, and key issues
      concerning the efficacy of pasteurization for elimination of M. paratuberculosis 
      from milk are summarized.

TI  - IgE/anti-IgE immune complexes in sera from patients with Crohn's disease do not
      contain food-specific IgE.
PG  - 67-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: An association of Crohn's disease (CD) with food allergy has been
      discussed, but the role of food-specific IgE has not been clarified yet. Since CD
      is combined with immune complex formation, we examined in the present study
      whether anti-IgE autoantibodies in such complexes might hinder the determination 
      of specific IgE. METHODS: In order to elucidate the role of food-specific IgE in 
      CD, we tested sera from CD patients (n = 107), healthy controls (n = 65) and
      allergics subjects (n = 7) for their IgE binding to food antigens (yeast, corn,
      celeriac, wheat) by an immunodot assay. After determining levels of IgE/IgG
      anti-IgE immune complexes, we purified them from serum pools of patients with CD,
      allergic subjects and healthy controls by affinity absorption using a monoclonal 
      anti-IgE antibody. These purified immune complexes were treated by low pH (pH =
      4) in order to dissolve them and to increase the detectability of food-specific
      IgE by RAST and CAP assay. RESULTS: In CD sera no food-specific IgE could be
      detected, but levels of immune complexes of IgE and IgG anti-IgE autoantibodies
      were statistically significantly increased compared to healthy controls. pH
      treatment of purified IgE/IgG anti-IgE immune complexes resulted in a significant
      increase in specific IgE to yeast, corn, wheat and celeriac detected by RAST,
      however, only in the serum sample purified from allergic subjects. After pH
      treatment of CD immune complexes, specific IgE levels remained still very low.
      CONCLUSION: Thus, even if IgE seems to represent an autoantigen in CD, it is
      unlike to specifically participate in the pathophysiology of the putative food
      adverse reactions.

TI  - Wernicke encephalopathy and beriberi during total parenteral nutrition
      attributable to multivitamin infusion shortage.
PG  - E10
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Wernicke encephalopathy (WE) is an acute neurologic disorder
      characterized by a triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and mental confusion. WE is 
      attributable to thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. Beriberi is the systemic
      counterpart of thiamine deficiency and often manifests in cardiovascular
      collapse. WE is usually associated with alcoholism and malnutrition. It has also 
      been seen in people with gastrointestinal diseases with malabsorption. Patients
      who have received total parenteral nutrition (TPN) without proper replacement of 
      thiamine have also developed WE. Since November 1996, there has been a shortage
      of multivitamin infusion (MVI). Many patients who were on chronic TPN with MVI
      ceased to receive the MVI and were converted to an oral form of the multivitamin.
      As a result, there have been several reports of children and adults on TPN who
      have developed WE as a result of thiamine deficiency. With this case report, we
      bring to attention the association of the MVI shortage and WE. Early diagnosis of
      WE is important, because if it is treated with thiamine in the acute stages, the 
      neurologic and cardiovascular abnormalities can be reversed. CASE REPORT: We
      report a 20-year-old female patient with Crohn's disease who developed WE as a
      result of thiamine deficiency. She had Crohn's disease since age 9 years and was 
      on chronic TPN. Two months before admission, MVI was discontinued in the TPN
      because of the shortage of its supply. An oral multivitamin tablet was
      substituted instead. She was admitted to the hospital for persistent vomiting. In
      the hospital, she continued to receive TPN without MVI, but continued taking an
      oral multivitamin preparation. Two weeks after admission, she developed signs of 
      WE including diplopia, ophthalmoplegia, nystagmus, and memory disturbance. She
      also developed hypotension that was thought to be caused by beriberi. She was
      treated with 50 mg of intravenous thiamine. Within hours of the intravenous
      thiamine, her hypotension resolved. The day after the infusion, she no longer
      complained of diplopia, and her ophthalmoplegia had improved dramatically.
      Magnetic resonance imaging showed several areas of abnormally high signal on
      T2-weighted images in the brainstem, thalamus, and mamillary bodies. The
      topographic distribution of these changes was typical of WE. After 2 months, her 
      mental status and neurologic status had recovered completely. CONCLUSION: WE and 
      thiamine deficiency should be considered in all patients with malabsorption,
      malnutrition, and malignancies. WE from thiamine deficiency can occur as a result
      of cessation of MVI in the TPN infusion. Even if an oral multivitamin preparation
      is given instead of MVI, patients with malabsorption may not absorb thiamine
      adequately. Prompt diagnosis of WE is important because it is potentially fatal
      and readily treatable with thiamine supplementation. Early recognition of WE may 
      be more difficult in children, because the classic triad of symptoms may not
      develop fully. Magnetic resonance imaging may be useful in these cases to confirm
      the diagnosis of WE. Because the shortage of MVI is expected to be a long-term,
      there are likely to be more cases of WE in the pediatric population of
      TPN-dependent children. Because there is no shortage of intravenous thiamine, it 
      should be administered with TPN even if MVI is not available.

TI  - A randomized, double-blind study of the effect of olestra on disease activity in 
      patients with quiescent inflammatory bowel disease. Olestra in IBD Study Group.
PG  - 389-99
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the effects of olestra, a zero-calorie fat substitute that 
      is neither digested nor absorbed, on the well-being and disease state of persons 
      with chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in remission. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
      Eighty-nine patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis (n = 43) or Crohn's
      disease (n = 46) in remission, with a history of disease of 2 years or longer,
      were enrolled in this prospective study from nine private practices, three
      university-based medical centers, and one Veterans Administration medical center 
      in the United States. Forty-four patients were randomly assigned to receive
      olestra and 45 to receive triglycerides in chips or cookies daily for 4 weeks. At
      Week 4, patients were classified as in remission, worsened, or relapsed according
      to an investigator's global assessment based on sigmoidoscopy (for ulcerative
      colitis) or the Crohn's disease activity index, laboratory findings, and clinical
      course. RESULTS: At Week 4, the olestra and triglyceride groups did not differ
      significantly with respect to the percentages of patients who relapsed (P =
      0.494; difference = 2.4%; upper 95% CL = 8.8%) or with respect to the percentages
      of patients who experienced any worsening of their symptoms (P = 0.630;
      difference = 0.2%; upper 95% CL = 13.3%). Of evaluable patients, 90% (37 of 41)
      given olestra remained in remission with no worsening, compared with 90% (38 of
      42) given triglycerides. Gastrointestinal symptoms were comparable between the
      treatment groups, and there were no treatment-related laboratory abnormalities.
      Six patients were excluded from analysis for reasons unrelated to treatment.
      CONCLUSION: Olestra did not affect the activity of quiescent mild to moderate
      IBD.

AB  - Currently, it is not known whether commercial pasteurization effectively kills
      Mycobacterium paratuberculosis in contaminated raw milk. Results from holder test
      tube experiments indicated that a residual population of viable bacteria remained
      after treatment at 65, 72, 74, or 76 degrees C for 0 to 30 min. Use of a
      laboratory-scale pasteurizer unit demonstrated that treatment of raw milk at 72
      degrees C for 15 s effectively killed all M. paratuberculosis.

TI  - Increased sister chromatid exchanges in peripheral lymphocytes of patients with
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 141-8
AB  - A cytogenetic study was performed using Crohn's disease patients to determine
      whether the presence of chromosome instability is related to Crohn's disease, a
      chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Sister chromatid exchange (SCE) frequencies
      in peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures from 22 Crohn's disease patients and an
      equal number of healthy controls matched for sex and age were analyzed. The mean 
      of SCE frequency in Crohn's disease patients was 11.64 +/- 0.42 (SEM) per cell,
      which was significantly higher than the value of 8.38 +/- 0.22 per cell in the
      matched controls (p < 0.0001). The Crohn's disease patients showed significantly 
      increased high frequency cells (HFC) as compared to those among the matched
      controls. There was a significant correlation between HFC frequencies of the
      Crohn's disease patients and the severity of their disease as determined by the
      number of relapses per year and the degree of chronic activity after adjusting
      for the smoking status (r = 0.54, p = 0.011). In both smokers and non-smokers,
      the mean SCE and HFC frequencies of the patients were significantly higher than
      those of the controls. These results suggest that Crohn's disease is a condition 
      with increased chromosome instability characterized by a high level of SCE
      frequencies which are associated with the inflammatory condition itself.

TI  - Gallbladder motility and cholecystokinin secretion during continuous enteral
      nutrition.
PG  - 2274-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: During total parenteral nutrition, gallbladder motility is impaired, 
      resulting in sludge and stone formation. Little is known about gallbladder
      motility during prolonged enteral nutrition. METHODS: We studied gallbladder
      motility during continuous enteral nutrition (CEN) in nine hospitalized patients 
      with active inflammatory bowel disease. The patients received a polymeric diet
      (2000 kcal/24 h) by CEN through a nasogastric tube for a prolonged period.
      Gallbladder volumes were obtained daily by ultrasonography, starting from day 0
      (before CEN) and on 7 consecutive days during CEN. At days 0, 1, 4, and 7, the
      gallbladder response to i.v. cholecystokinin (CCK-33; 0.5 Ivy Dog unit/kg/h) was 
      studied. Plasma CCK levels were determined at regular intervals by
      radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed on day 0
      between patients and a group of nine healthy control subjects in fasting
      gallbladder volumes (19.4 +/- 2.3 and 19.6 +/- 2.4 cm3, respectively) and
      gallbladder contraction during CCK infusion (56 +/- 14% and 69 +/- 7%,
      respectively). During CEN, from day 1 to day 7, mean gallbladder volume remained 
      significantly (p < 0.05) reduced compared with fasting gallbladder volume, and
      mean plasma CCK levels remained significantly (p < 0.05) increased compared with 
      fasting levels. Although gallbladder volume was significantly reduced during CEN,
      the gallbladder contractile response to CCK was not affected; at days 1, 4, and
      7, gallbladder contraction was 36-57%. CONCLUSIONS: During CEN, 1) gallbladder
      volume is significantly reduced and plasma CCK levels are significantly
      increased, 2) these effects are sustained over time (7 days), and 3) the
      gallbladder remains responsive to exogenous CCK. These results indicate that
      gallbladder contractility and gallbladder responsiveness to CCK are preserved
      during prolonged CEN in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Enteral nutrition for Crohn's disease in Japan.
PG  - S48-53
AB  - UNLABELLED: Indication for and an evaluation of enteral nutrition in Crohn's
      disease differ between Japan and western countries. PURPOSE: Japanese results are
      reported and differences are discussed. RESULTS: Enteral nutrition with an
      elemental diet is first-line therapy for active Crohn's disease in Japan. The
      remission induction rate of elemental diet therapy is approximately 80 percent,
      which is superior to steroids. Furthermore, elemental diet therapy induces
      radiographic and endoscopic remission. On the other hand, meta-analysis from
      randomized, controlled trials showed steroids to be more effective than enteral
      nutrition in western countries. The differences are considered to be the result
      of such differences as therapeutic duration of enteral nutrition, the composition
      of enteral diets used, criteria for remission, the quality of life score of a
      long-term fast with a nasogastric tube, medical care, and health insurance
      system. The main mechanism of the therapeutic effect of elemental diet is
      speculated to be attributable to removal of food antigens and decreases of
      secretion and motility (bowel rest) by very low fat. To prevent relapse and
      rehospitalization, home enteral nutrition is now used widely in Japan. The
      therapeutic effect is observed in patients with ileal involvement, and more than 
      1,200 kcal/day is more effective than a lower amount. CONCLUSION: Most Japanese
      studies were open-labeled, uncontrolled trials. We should conduct randomized,
      controlled trials comparing enteral nutrition with steroids during the active
      stage of Crohn's disease and home enteral nutrition with drugs in maintaining
      remission and investigate the therapeutic effect, quality of life, and costs.

TI  - [Nutrition in the etiopathogenesis of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases].
PG  - 637-49
AB  - It is currently held that the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      involves a complex interaction of host responses, some immunologic and
      genetically determined, and external influences including microbial and dietary
      factors. Nutritional surveys and studies testing stepwise exclusion dietary
      compounds have suggested that dietary factors might be linked to the occurrence
      of IBD. Food allergy was suggested early as a possible trigger for the
      inflammatory response; however, no firm evidence has been gathered over the years
      to substantiate this possibility. The possibility that patients with Crohn's
      disease may have an unusual premorbid pattern of dietary intake has also been
      examined since the early seventies. Several groups of investigators report a high
      intake of refined sugars (i.e. sucrose), recycled cooking oil, a more frequent
      consumption of fast foods in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis
      respectively. However, a critical comparison of incidence and prevalence studies 
      published from 1976 until 1994 clearly showed no pre-existing nutritional
      abnormality that has been identified consistently in patients who develop
      inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - A randomized controlled study comparing elemental diet and steroid treatment in
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 735-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: Elemental diet is considered an effective primary treatment for
      active Crohn's disease, but it is usually given by a feeding tube. METHODS:
      Twenty-two patients (12 males, median age 30 years, range 18-60) with moderately 
      active Crohn's disease were enrolled in a randomized study in which the efficacy 
      of an elemental diet administered orally was compared to high-dose
      corticosteroids in achieving clinical and laboratory remission. Ten patients were
      treated by oral elemental diet (Peptamen, Clintec, USA) and 10 received
      corticosteroids. Both treatment regimens lasted 2 weeks. The two groups did not
      differ with respect to age, sex, body weight, location of disease, treatment or
      disease activity prior to the study. In all patients studied, simple Crohn's
      disease activity index, nutritional status (expressed as body mass index),
      percentage of ideal body weight, fat mass, fat free mass, erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate, interleukin-6, intestinal permeability (expressed as
      permeability index), prealbumin, retinol binding protein and multiskin test were 
      evaluated before and after treatment. RESULTS: After 2 weeks of treatment, there 
      were significant improvements in simple Crohn's disease activity index,
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate, permeability index, body mass index, prealbumin, 
      retinol binding protein and multiskin test in the elemental diet group. There
      were significant improvements in simple Crohn's disease activity index and fat
      free mass in the corticosteroid group. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that, in
      the short term, an oral elemental diet is at least as effective as steroids in
      inducing remission of mild-moderately active Crohn's disease, but it may be more 
      effective in improving the nutritional status of these patients, probably through
      a more rapid restoration of normal intestinal permeability.

TI  - Pre-illness dietary factors in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 754-60
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of environmental factors has been demonstrated in the
      pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Nutrition may be one of them.
      AIM: To investigate the pre-illness diet in patients with recent IBD in
      comparison with matched population and clinic controls. METHODS: Quantified
      dietary histories were obtained from 87 patients with recent IBD (54 ulcerative
      colitis (UC) and 33 Crohn's disease (CD)) and 144 controls. Odds ratios (OR) for 
      IBD were derived for intake levels of various foods. RESULTS: A high sucrose
      consumption was associated with an increased risk for IBD (OR 2.85 (p = 0.03)
      against population controls and 5.3 (p = 0.00) against clinic controls). Lactose 
      consumption showed no effect while fructose intake was negatively associated with
      risk for IBD (NS). Similar trends were noted in UC and CD. A high fat intake was 
      associated with an increased risk for UC; this was particularly marked for animal
      fat (OR 4.09, p = 0.02) and cholesterol (OR 4.57, p = 0.02). A high intake of
      fluids (p = 0.04), magnesium (p = 0.04), vitamin C, and fruits (NS) was
      negatively associated with the risk for IBD, while a positive association was
      found for retinol (p = 0.01). Most of the findings were similar in UC and CD
      except for potassium and vegetable consumption which showed a negative
      association only with risk for CD. CONCLUSIONS: An association was found between 
      pre-illness diet and subsequent development of UC and CD. The effect of dietary
      components may be primary or modulatory.

TI  - Self-reported food intolerance in chronic inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 569-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although suggested, it has never been convincingly documented that
      food sensitivity is of pathogenetic importance in chronic inflammatory bowel
      disease. However, many patients may relate their gastrointestinal symptoms to
      specific food items ingested and may restrict their diet accordingly. METHODS: A 
      questionnaire was sent to all patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease
      who attended the outpatient clinic, Medical Dept., Roskilde County Hospital in
      Koge, Denmark, in the year 1993. The patients were asked whether they had
      problems with any particular food item and, if so, to describe the symptoms
      experienced from it. A control group of 70 healthy persons were included.
      RESULTS: Among 189 patients, 132 (70%) responded. One hundred and thirty had
      completed the questionnaire, 52 males and 78 females aged 13-89 years (median, 43
      years). Fifty-three (41%) had Crohn's disease (CD), 69 (53%) ulcerative colitis
      (UC), and 8 (6%) unclassified colitis. Forty-one patients (31 CD, 10 UC)
      were-operated on; 51 (19 CD, 32 UC) had disease activity. Sixty-five per cent of 
      the patients and 14% of the controls reported being intolerant to one or more
      food items (P < 0.0001). The intolerance covered a wide range of food products.
      The commonest symptoms among patients were diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and
      meteorism and among controls, regurgitation. Food intolerance was equally common 
      in CD (66%) and UC (64%) and was not related to previous operation, disease
      activity or disease location. CONCLUSION: Most patients with chronic inflammatory
      bowel intolerance disease feel intolerant to different food items and may
      restrict their diet accordingly. The frequency and pattern of food intolerance
      did not differ between patients with CD and UC. The food intolerance was probably
      unspecific rather than of pathogenetic importance.

TI  - Polyunsaturated fat in the diet may improve intestinal function in patients with 
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 262-70
AB  - To investigate the effect of increasing dietary polyunsaturated fat intake on fat
      absorption in Crohn's patients, normal subjects and subjects with inactive
      Crohn's disease consumed a high polyunsaturated to saturated fat ratio diet.
      Subjects participated in breath tests before and after six months of a high
      polyunsaturated to saturated (P/S) fat ratio diet to measure their response to
      [1-13C] 10:0 and [1-13C] 16:0 ingested with a test meal. Whole body
      absorption-oxidation of C10:0 was not affected by the diet treatment. Before diet
      treatment, whole body absorption-oxidation of C16:0 in Crohn's patients was 80%
      of that observed for control subjects. After consuming a high polyunsaturated to 
      saturated fatty acid ratio diet, subjects increased oxidation of C16:0 by 85%
      compared to before the diet treatment period. It is concluded that (1) absorption
      of labelled C16:0 from a test meal is reduced in Crohn's patients, and (2)
      consumption of a high polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratio diet improves
      the utilization of dietary C16:0 by Crohn's patients.

TI  - [Current medical therapies for Crohn's disease in Japan].
PG  - 406-11
AB  - Current available therapies for Crohn's disease in Japan are reviewed in this
      report. Elemental diet is most effective for both inducing and maintaining
      remission in Japan. There appears to be no difference between elemental diet,
      oligopeptide diet and intact nutrients in effectiveness for active Crohn's
      disease. Although corticosteroid is also useful for treating active Crohn's
      disease, low dose of it is not effective for maintaining remission. Steroid has
      important role in combined therapy with elemental diet. New steroid, budesonide
      appears to be fascinate because of less adverse effects. Recently, instead of
      salazosulfapyridine, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) proved to be more effective
      not only for active disease but also for maintenance of remission including small
      intestinal type of Crohn's disease with reduced adverse effects. Azathioprine,
      6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), methotrexate and metronidazole are second choice
      treatment in patients whose disease relapse frequently. Although methotrexate
      appears to be effective for active Crohn's disease, the role of it has to be
      defined. Evidences support the use of 5-ASA and methotrexate for prophylaxis
      after surgery. It is important to chose and combine the therapies, thinking of
      the situation of each patient.

AB  - The relationships between non-specific inflammatory bowel disease and nutrition
      is considered. One of the hypotheses holds that environmental factors, especially
      those in dietary intake, can be the initiators of intestinal inflammation. In
      this connection authors examined a group of patients suffering from Crohns
      disease and ulcerative colitis. Results observed in patients with Crohns disease 
      indicate: preferred consumption of flour products, decreased intake of vegetables
      and fruit, lowered tolerance to milk and milk products, increased sugar
      consumption, increased proportion of smokers, no differences in diet regimen
      between nick and healthy subjects. (Tab. 3, Ref. 16.)

AB  - Enteral feeding has been shown to be as effective as primary therapy for Crohn's 
      disease, but it requires high patient motivation, may be unpalatable and is
      expensive. However, in adolescents with growth failure and when corticosteroid
      therapy is contra-indicated or has failed, it may become the treatment of choice.
      Furthermore, dietary therapy allows circumvention of the adverse side-effects of 
      repeated courses of steroids. A number of different hypotheses have been proposed
      to explain the effect of enteral feeds but none has reached universal acceptance.
      Prospective trials suggest that the exclusion of whole protein is not necessary. 
      Comparison of feeds with differing composition suggests that a low fat content
      increases efficacy and various explanations have been offered. The reduction of
      colonic bacterial load may also be important. Because symptoms of Crohn's disease
      may be provoked by eating, there is a risk of falsely attributing symptoms to
      specific foodstuffs. However, in many individuals foods can be identified which
      affect disease activity, and their exclusion leads to prolongation of disease
      remission. Dietetic supervision during food testing is important to avoid
      detrimental effects on nutrient and micronutrient intake.
