AB  - The pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) is not fully
      understood. The interaction between intestinal environmental factors of food and 
      intestinal microbes and the immunological system of hosts seems to be an
      important aspect. We have reviewed the relationship of the daily consumption of
      dietary animal meat and fats, dairy products, sugar, and other factors that may
      be linked to the occurrence of CD and UC from the literature and Japanese
      epidemiological data. In the present study, we reviewed the association between
      food and intestinal microbes and other factors contributing to the occurence of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) from epidemiological data and case-control
      studies of IBD in the literature that appeared on Medline, and assessed the
      reports of intestinal microbes involved in the occurrence of IBD. We found
      several papers describing the positive association of animal meat and sweets and 
      sugar with the occurrence of CD and UC. An analysis of Japanese epidemiological
      data suggested that the registered number of patients with CD or UC started to
      increase more than 20 years after an increased daily consumption of dietary
      animal meat and fats, and milk and dairy products, and after a decreased
      consumption of rice. Many studies implied a positive role of intestinal microbes 
      in the occurrence of IBD. Intestinal environmental factors, such as Westernized
      food and intestinal microbes, seem to be involved in the increased occurrence of 
      IBD.

TI  - Folate concentrations in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed inflammatory
      bowel disease.
PG  - 545-50
LID - 10.3945/ajcn.2008.26576 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Folate is postulated to protect against cell injury and long-term
      risk of cancer. Folate deficiency has been shown to be associated with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, folate concentrations are poorly
      delineated in children with IBD. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare folate
      concentrations between children with newly diagnosed IBD and healthy controls.
      DESIGN: Red blood cell folate (RBCF) and whole-blood folate (WBF) concentrations 
      were measured in 78 children (mean age: 12.8 +/- 2.7 y): 22 patients with newly
      diagnosed untreated Crohn disease, 11 patients with ulcerative colitis, 4
      patients with indeterminate colitis, and 41 controls. Vitamin supplementation and
      dietary intakes determined by food-frequency questionnaire were recorded for 20
      IBD patients and 28 controls. RESULTS: RBCF concentrations were 19.4% lower in
      controls (587.0 +/- 148.6 ng/mL) than in patients (728.7 +/- 185.8 ng/mL; P =
      0.0004), and WBF concentrations were 11.1% lower in controls (218.2 +/- 49.7
      ng/mL) than in patients (245.3 +/- 59.1 ng/mL; P = 0.031). Total folate intake
      was 18.8% higher in controls (444.7 +/- 266.7 microg/d) than in IBD patients
      (361.1 +/- 230.6 microg/d), but this difference was not statistically significant
      (P = 0.264). Folate intakes were below the Recommended Dietary Allowance (200-400
      microg/d), adjusted for age and sex, in 35.4% of study subjects. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      contrast with previous evidence of folate deficiency in adult IBD patients, our
      data indicate higher folate concentrations in children with newly diagnosed
      untreated IBD than in controls. This finding was unexpected, especially in light 
      of the higher dietary folate intakes and hematocrit values in children without
      IBD. The influence of IBD therapy on folate metabolism and the long-term clinical
      implications of high RBCF and WBF concentrations at the time of IBD diagnosis
      should be explored further.

TI  - Nutritional status of patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 195-200
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Malnutrition is a common feature in patients with Crohn's
      disease (CD), which leads to frequent infections and poor prognosis. In view of
      the rising incidence of CD in India we planned this study to assess the
      nutritional status of patients with CD. METHODS: Nutritional status of 112
      patients (mean age 35.9 [SD 11.7] years; 61 men) with CD was assessed by
      anthropometric, dietary and biochemical parameters. Patients were considered
      malnourished if 3 or more anthropometric parameters (% ideal body weight [IBW], %
      tricep skin fold [TSF], %mid upper arm circumference [MUAC], and % mid arm muscle
      circumference [MAMC], body mass index [BMI]) were abnormal. Dietary intake was
      assessed by a 24-hour dietary recall along with a semi-quantitative food
      frequency method. Eighty volunteers were taken as healthy controls (HC). RESULTS:
      At the time of assessment, 77 patients were in remission and 35 had active
      disease. The values of BMI, MUAC, TSF and mid arm fat area (MAFA) in patients
      were significantly lower than those in healthy controls. MAMC and mid arm muscle 
      area (MAMA) of patients and controls were comparable. TSF (Rem vs HC = 10.4
      [2.8-71] vs 16 [3-41]) and MAFA (Rem vs HC = 1236 [240-7757] vs 1858 [322-5650]) 
      of the patients in the remission phase were significantly lower than those of
      healthy controls; the remaining parameters were comparable. There was no
      difference in the dietary intake of patients in the remission and active phases, 
      and healthy controls. The percentage energy fulfillment of the patients was lower
      than that of healthy controls. Twenty-nine of 35 (82.8%) patients in the active
      and 30 of 77 (38.9%) patients in the remission phase were malnourished (OR 7.5,
      95% CI 2.8-20.4). The overall prevalence of malnutrition was 52.6% among
      patients. CONCLUSION: The percentage of malnourished patients in the active and
      remission phases of the disease was 82.8% and 38.9%, respectively, possibly due
      to low percentage energy fulfillment.

LID - 10.1016/j.nutres.2008.02.005 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn
      disease (CD), is a disorder characterized by diffuse inflammation of the
      gastrointestinal tract. The immune response and inflammation are mediated by
      polyunsaturated fatty acids and influenced by dietary fats and lipid metabolism. 
      This study examined the qualitative and quantitative fat intake of IBD patients
      and healthy controls on plasma phospholipid and erythrocyte membrane phospholipid
      (EMP) fatty acid content. Measurement of the fatty acid composition of plasma
      phospholipid and EMP were performed in 29 UC patients, 20 CD patients, and 31
      healthy controls. Anthropometric characteristics and data on dietary intake were 
      also collected. We observed significantly lower lipid intake in UC and CD
      patients vs controls. The UC and CD patients had significantly higher levels of
      linoleic acid in their EMP than did controls. There were no significant
      differences in the levels of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, but there were
      significantly higher levels of the n-6 in the EMP of UC and CD patients compared 
      with controls. The significant differences persisted after the data were adjusted
      for potential confounders and lipid intake. Higher levels of linoleic acids and
      n-6 fatty acids, which are involved in production of proinflammatory mediators,
      were found in IBD patients compared with controls, thereby implicating n-6 fatty 
      acids in the pathophysiology of the disease.

      Apart from the disease complications, the drugs' adverse affects, especially
      corticosteroids, are significant. In the past decade major progress was made in
      elucidating the pathogenesis of IBD, which led to new treatment options aiming to
      achieve better control of the disease and decrease the various complications of
      current therapy. In this review we provide an overview of novel therapies for
      IBD, their efficacy, safety and their current use in children.

TI  - Effects of a supplementary diet with specially processed cereals in patients with
      short bowel syndrome.
PG  - 1085-93
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0b013e328303c00a [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Short bowel syndrome patients frequently experience impaired
      health-related quality of life. This syndrome is also associated with increased
      costs for the individuals concerned and the community. Intake of specially
      processed cereals has been demonstrated to decrease intestinal secretion. This
      study evaluates the effect of a supplementary diet with specially processed
      cereals compared with nonprocessed cereals. METHODS: This investigation is a
      randomized double-blind, cross-over multicentre prospective study of 26
      intestinal resected out patients, considered as short bowel syndrome patients.
      The patients were divided into groups A or B, in accordance with the first
      allocated treatment. Subgroup analyses of the underlying diagnoses and type of
      surgical procedure were performed. The studied parameters were faecal volume,
      nocturnal stools, abdominal pain/discomfort, health-related quality of life,
      peripheral blood tests and anthropometric data. RESULTS: In both groups, intake
      of nonprocessed cereals significantly decreased the faecal volume. The subgroup
      analyses of patients with a history of ulcerative colitis (compared with Crohn's 
      disease) and nonileostomy-operated procedure (compared with ileostomi-operated
      procedure) showed significantly decreased faecal volume during nonprocessed
      cereals intake. Peripheral blood tests, quality of life and anthropometry were
      not affected. CONCLUSION: In this study, nonprocessed cereals seemed to be as
      effective as specially processed cereals in decreasing faecal volume in general
      and especially in ulcerative colitis patients (mainly operated with nonileostomy 
      techniques). Our results indicate that use of supplementary cereals is safe for
      this group of patients, but should optimally include evaluation of the underlying
      diagnosis and the surgical method used.

PG  - 2419-25

AB  - Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory condition with a relapsing-remitting
      disease course. Treatment often requires both induction and maintenance
      strategies. The management of mild to moderate Crohn's disease is challenging
      because the natural history of mild disease is not known and effective treatment 
      options are limited. In this article, our objective is to provide a brief
      overview of the evidence supporting current therapies in the treatment of mild to
      moderate luminal Crohn's disease and to explore a few of the newer therapeutic
      options. As induction agents for mild to moderately active Crohn's disease, there
      is reasonable evidence to support the use of budesonide for terminal ileal and
      right colonic disease, and sulfasalazine for colonic disease. Although budesonide
      can be used in the short term (3-6 months) for maintenance of quiescent disease, 
      there are no effective therapies for the long-term maintenance of mild to
      moderate Crohn's disease. Mesalazine appears to have no role in either the
      treatment of active or quiescent disease. Currently, there is insufficient data
      to draw conclusions on the potential role of antibacterials, probiotics or
      prebiotics.

TI  - Quality of life of patients and medical cost of "half elemental diet" as
      maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease: secondary outcomes of a randomised
      controlled trial.
PG  - 390-4
LID - 10.1016/j.dld.2008.09.007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Quality of life (QOL) of the patients and medical costs are
      important in current medical treatments, especially those for chronic diseases.
      We have reported the effectiveness of 'half elemental diet (ED)' as maintenance
      therapy for patients with Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this study was to
      evaluate the QOL of CD patients and medical costs of half-ED. METHODS: Fifty-one 
      CD patients in remission were randomly assigned to a half-ED group (n=26) or a
      free diet group (n=25). The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of relapse
      during a 2-year period. This time, we investigated the QOL of the patients and
      medical costs of half-ED, as secondary outcomes. QOL was evaluated using the
      Japanese version of the IBDQ scoring system, and medical costs were calculated
      monthly from the receipts. RESULTS: IBDQ score was not significantly different
      between the two groups at 1 and 13 months after the start of maintenance
      treatment. Medical costs were not significantly different between them either.
      This study showed that half-ED therapy did not affect the treatment of CD
      patients, neither regarding their QOL nor medical costs. CONCLUSION: This study
      has confirmed this half-ED therapy is beneficial for patients with Crohn's
      disease.

TI  - [Distinct clinical characteristics of inflammatory bowel disease in children
      younger than 5 years].
PG  - 132-6
AB  - UNLABELLED: In the last decades an increase in morbidity of inflammatory bowel
      disease, particularly of Crohn disease, in children has been observed. OBJECTIVE:
      Assessment of clinical course and activity of inflammatory bowel disease in
      children younger than 5 years was the goal of the study. MATERIAL AND METHODS:
      The study comprised 21 children aged 2 to 5 years (13 boys and 8 girls) who were 
      diagnosed with: Lesniowski-Crohn disease (7 children), ulcerative colitis (7
      children) and indeterminate colitis (remaining 7 children). RESULTS: Among
      studied children boys prevailed (61.9%). In 6 children the disease started in the
      first and second year of life; the average age of disease onset was 26.9 months
      and the time between the onset of the disease and the diagnosis was 16.6 months. 
      46% of patients came from the cities with population above 100000 when only 23%
      lived in the country. Autoimmune diseases were diagnosed in the families of 6
      children, food or pollen allergy in the families of 11 children. Abdominal pain, 
      diarrhea, presence of blood and mucous in the stool, fever and lack of thrive
      were most apparent in the clinical picture. The pathological changes were present
      mainly in the large intestine and only in one case in the upper part of the
      alimentary tract and jejunum. The observed course of the disease was severe or
      moderate. In two children aged 3 years colectomy was performed. CONCLUSIONS: In
      children younger than 5 years severe and moderate course of the Lesniowski-Crohn 
      disease and ulcerative colitis is apparent. Fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea,
      presence of blood and mucous in the stool and lack of appetite were the most
      often seen symptoms. Pathological changes in children younger than 5 years were
      present mainly in the large intestine and only in single cases in the upper part 
      of the alimentary tract and jejunum. In children with inflammatory bowel disease 
      a frequent occurrence of allergy, bronchitis, pneumonia and urinary tract
      infection, which required antibiotics, was observed.

      identified by gut microbiota analysis of Crohn disease patients.
PG  - 16731-6
LID - 10.1073/pnas.0804812105 [doi]
AB  - A decrease in the abundance and biodiversity of intestinal bacteria within the
      dominant phylum Firmicutes has been observed repeatedly in Crohn disease (CD)
      patients. In this study, we determined the composition of the mucosa-associated
      microbiota of CD patients at the time of surgical resection and 6 months later
      using FISH analysis. We found that a reduction of a major member of Firmicutes,
      Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, is associated with a higher risk of postoperative
      recurrence of ileal CD. A lower proportion of F. prausnitzii on resected ileal
      Crohn mucosa also was associated with endoscopic recurrence at 6 months. To
      evaluate the immunomodulatory properties of F. prausnitzii we analyzed the
      anti-inflammatory effects of F. prausnitzii in both in vitro (cellular models)
      and in vivo [2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS)-induced] colitis in mice.
      In Caco-2 cells transfected with a reporter gene for NF-kappaB activity, F.
      prausnitzii had no effect on IL-1beta-induced NF-kappaB activity, whereas the
      supernatant abolished it. In vitro peripheral blood mononuclear cell stimulation 
      by F. prausnitzii led to significantly lower IL-12 and IFN-gamma production
      levels and higher secretion of IL-10. Oral administration of either live F.
      prausnitzii or its supernatant markedly reduced the severity of TNBS colitis and 
      tended to correct the dysbiosis associated with TNBS colitis, as demonstrated by 
      real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis. F. prausnitzii exhibits
      anti-inflammatory effects on cellular and TNBS colitis models, partly due to
      secreted metabolites able to block NF-kappaB activation and IL-8 production.
      These results suggest that counterbalancing dysbiosis using F. prausnitzii as a
      probiotic is a promising strategy in CD treatment.

AB  - Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) is currently approved by the US
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of ischemic stroke in
      patients > 18 years of age who present within 3 hours of stroke onset and meet
      certain criteria. We report a case of a 16-year-old, previously healthy female
      who presented with a basilar artery occlusion and pontine ischemic stroke. She
      was treated with intravenous t-PA approximately 4 hours after the onset of
      symptoms. The patient demonstrated a remarkable recovery 6 hours after onset of
      her symptoms and had minimal deficits on discharge from the hospital 1 week
      later. She was found to have a lupus anticoagulant and was heterozygous for the
      prothrombin gene G2010A mutation. These were likely contributing causes for her
      stroke. She was also homozygous for plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1)
      4G/4G, which at present is a controversial stroke risk factor.

TI  - High prevalence of vitamin K and D deficiency and decreased BMD in inflammatory
      bowel disease.
PG  - 935-42

AB  - SUMMARY: Vitamin K and D deficiency and decreased bone mineral density (BMD) were
      highly prevalent in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially
      Crohn's disease (CD). Dietary intakes of these vitamins, however, were above the 
      Japanese adequate intakes in IBD patients, suggesting that malabsorption is the
      basis for hypovitaminosis K and D and decreased BMD. INTRODUCTION: We have
      studied the possible involvement of vitamin K and D deficiency in the
      pathogenesis of decreased BMD in IBD. METHODS: Seventy patients with IBD were
      evaluated for their BMD; plasma levels of vitamin K; phylloquinone (PK),
      menaquinone-7 (MK-7), and 25OH-D; serum PTH, protein induced by vitamin K absence
      (PIVKA-II), and undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) levels; and their food
      intake. RESULTS: Compared with ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, CD patients had 
      significantly lower plasma vitamin K and 25OH-D concentrations; significantly
      higher serum levels of PTH, PIVKA-II, and ucOC; and significantly lower BMD
      scores at almost all measurement sites. More IBD patients were vitamin K
      deficient in bone than in liver. Multiple regression analyses revealed that low
      plasma concentrations of vitamin K and 25OH-D were independent risk factors for
      low BMD and that they were associated with the patients' fat intake, but not with
      their intake of these vitamins. CONCLUSION: IBD patients have high prevalence of 
      decreased BMD and vitamin K and D deficiency probably caused by malabsorption of 
      these vitamins.

TI  - Positive impact of blocking tumor necrosis factor alpha on the nutritional status
      in pediatric Crohn's disease patients.
PG  - 19-25
LID - 10.1007/s00384-008-0578-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: TNFalpha seems to contribute to inflammation and malnutrition in
      Crohn's disease (CD) patients. In CD patients, the comparative effects on
      nutritional status of infliximab and traditional therapy have not yet been
      determined. The aim of our study was to assess the effects of infliximab as
      compared with those of standard therapy on nutritional status, disease activity, 
      resting energy expenditure (REE), and food intake in CD children and adolescents.
      METHODS: From September 1999 to September 2005, all CD patients treated with
      infliximab (group A) were reviewed and matched with CD patients treated with
      traditional therapy (mesalazine and azathioprine) (group B). RESULTS: Fourteen CD
      patients from group A and 14 from group B were included; median interval before
      follow-up investigation was 10 months. Baseline and final values of weight,
      height, body mass index (BMI), pediatric CD activity index (pCDAI), REE, and food
      intake were studied. In treated patients, but not in control group, mean baseline
      weight (kg) and BMI values, 39.7 +/- 13.1 and 17.9 +/- 3.3, respectively, were
      significantly lower than their final values 42.6 +/- 13.2 and 18.9 +/- 3.1, and
      median pCDAI values 23.5 were significantly higher than their final values 10 (P 
      < 0.05). Significant changes in height, REE, and food intake were not found in
      either group. CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric CD patients, infliximab seems to impact
      positively on the nutritional status as demonstrated by the improvement in weight
      and BMI, but not in linear growth; effects on nutritional status seem to be due
      to amelioration of disease activity, rather than to REE reduction or food intake 
      increase.

PG  - 83-9

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ghrelin, a potent orexigenic peptide produced by the stomach, may be 
      affected by circulating inflammatory mediators. AIM: To assess the effect of an
      anti-TNFalpha antibody on ghrelin in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS:
      Fifteen patients with Crohn's receiving infliximab were studied before and 1 week
      after infusion. Following an overnight fast, blood was sampled before a meal and 
      then every 20 min for 2 h. Total ghrelin and CRP were measured using ELISA.
      Acylated ghrelin and TNFalpha, IFNgamma, IL-1beta and IL-6 were measured with
      bioplex. Harvey Bradshaw Activity Index was assessed. RESULTS: Median (95% CI)
      2-h integrated plasma total ghrelin increased from 162 (99-311) before infliximab
      to 200 (128-387) pg/mL h, (P = 0.02) after. Following infliximab, 20 min
      postmeal, median acylated ghrelin decreased from 50.3 (24-64) to 38.6 (26-82)
      pg/mL, (P = 0.04) thus reverting to a traditional meal related ghrelin curve.
      Median (range) disease activity decreased from 5 (2-28) before to 3 (0-22), (P = 
      0.0001) and Median (95% CI) TNFalpha decreased from 2.8 (1.89-4.48) to 1.31
      (0.73-2.06) pg/mL (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab increases circulating
      total ghrelin by 25% in CD and restores the postprandial response of acylated
      ghrelin to food intake. Acylated and de-sacyl ghrelin remain unchanged,
      suggesting that an alternate isoform could be affected by infliximab.

AB  - The plausibility of a causal role of Mycobacterium avium subspecies
      paratuberculosis (MAP) in Crohn's disease has gone from controversial to
      compelling. This century old debate is resolving because of unfolding
      understanding of shared genetic susceptibilities for Crohn's and mycobacterial
      infection in addition to newer laboratory tests to detect MAP which have linked
      MAP and Crohn's. Mycobacterial heat shock proteins are associated with a
      multitude of "autoimmune" diseases, including Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and
      the initiating events of atherosclerosis. These heat shock proteins may come from
      MAP; this article postulates a causal role for MAP in multiple inflammatory and
      "autoimmune" diseases.

TI  - Role of mucosal dendritic cells in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 5138-48
AB  - The gastrointestinal innate and adaptive immune system continuously faces the
      challenge of potent stimuli from the commensal microflora and food constituents. 
      These local immune responses require a tight control, the outcome of which is in 
      most cases the induction of tolerance. Local T cell immunity is an important
      compartment of the specific intestinal immune system. T cell reactivity is
      programmed during the initial stage of its activation by professional presenting 
      cells. Mucosal dendritic cells (DCs) are assumed to play key roles in regulating 
      immune responses in the antigen-rich gastrointestinal environment. Mucosal DCs
      are a heterogeneous population that can either initiate (innate and adaptive)
      immune responses, or control intestinal inflammation and maintain tolerance.
      Defects in this regulation are supposed to lead to the two major forms of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis
      (UC). This review will discuss the emerging role of mucosal DCs in regulating
      intestinal inflammation and immune responses.

TI  - Nutritional supplementation with polymeric diet enriched with transforming growth
      factor-beta 2 for children with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 503-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: A polymeric diet rich in transforming growth factor-beta 2 used as a 
      single nutrient has been shown to induce remission in 79% of children with
      Crohn's disease. OBJECTIVES: To summarize the experience of several pediatric
      gastroenterology units in Israel using a TGFbeta2-enriched polymeric diet
      (Modulen IBD) supplementation in children and adolescents with Crohn's disease.
      METHODS: In a retrospective study we reviewed the charts of 28 children with
      Crohn's disease (10 girls, 18 boys) who received, in addition to conventional
      treatment, Modulen IBD as a supplement to their regular nutrition. These children
      were compared with 18 children supplemented with standard polymeric formula
      (Ensure Plus) and 18 children without formula supplementation. We recorded
      clinical manifestations, growth, and the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index
      before and after initiation of the polymeric diet. RESULTS: The Modulen-treated
      children showed a significant decrease in PCDAI from 34.3 to 15.7 (P< 0.0001). A 
      significant decrease in PCDAI was recorded also in the Ensure Plus group, from 35
      to 22 (P= 0.02) but not in the non-supplemented group. Significant improvements
      in body mass index (P = 0.01) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P= 0.03) were
      recorded at follow-up (median 3.4 months) only in the Modulen IBD group.
      CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of children with Crohn's disease, supplementation of 
      the diet with Modulen IBD as well as supplementation with Ensure Plus was
      associated with a decrease in PCDAI. The children supplemented with Modulen IBD
      also showed improvement in BMI, suggesting an additional advantage of nutritional
      therapy in children with this disease.

TI  - Enteral nutrition in adult Crohn's disease: present status and perspectives.
PG  - 875-84
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.200800093 [doi]
AB  - Enteral nutrition has long been a therapeutic alternative often used in adult
      Crohn's disease patients to obtain remission or clinical response, especially in 
      those not responding to conventional therapy such as corticosteroids. However,
      the increasing use of immunosuppressors (6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine,
      methotrexate, etc.), and the advent of biotherapies (especially anti-tumor
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) antibodies), decreased its use in adult Crohn's
      disease. Nevertheless, enteral nutrition remains of interest in patients
      presenting concomitant malnutrition (in particular in nonobstructed patients
      needing surgery), or in those intolerant or who failed to other therapeutics. In 
      addition, recent studies provide data indicating its potential interest in
      maintenance therapy in selected patients groups. Finally, future research (in
      particular in the field of immuno- or pharmaconutrition) could lead to enteral
      formula's improvement, with better tolerance and acceptability, as well as
      increased efficacy.

TI  - Scenario analysis of changes in consumption of dairy products caused by a
      hypothetical causal link between Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis 
      and Crohn's disease.
PG  - 3245-58
LID - 10.3168/jds.2007-0698 [doi]
AB  - Johne's disease is an infectious disease of cattle caused by Mycobacterium avium 
      subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP). Crohn's disease (CD) is a human disease of
      unknown etiology that is characterized by chronic bowel inflammation. No causal
      link has been scientifically established between MAP and CD, but it is important 
      to understand possible impacts on society should such a causal link be
      established. The goal of this paper is to analyze the implications and the
      possible economic impacts that finding such a link would have on milk demand in
      the dairy industry and to provide a framework for further discussion among
      stakeholders. Three scenarios were developed based on the effectiveness of
      possible risk-mitigation strategies. In the first scenario, it was assumed that
      an effective strategy exists; therefore, a negligible demand decrease in the
      consumption of dairy products was expected. In the second scenario, it was
      assumed that new risk mitigation would need to be implemented to minimize the
      health hazard for humans. In this case, a small milk demand decrease was
      expected, but larger demand decreases were also possible. The third scenario
      assumed that no fully effective risk mitigation was available, and this resulted 
      in a considerable demand decrease and a potential reduction in milk supply as a
      result of regulatory measures. A milk demand reduction of 1 or 5% resulted in a
      reduction in consumer surplus of $600 million and $2.9 billion, and a reduction
      in dairy farm income of $270 million and $1.3 billion, respectively. A decrease
      in milk supply would cause a slight increase in total losses, but would cause the
      greatest losses to test-positive dairy farms. Given the current scientific
      knowledge about MAP and CD, we conclude that if a link were established, it is
      most likely that the first or second scenario would occur. Thus, consumer
      response and economic consequences to the discovery of such a link are expected
      to be limited, but could be large if the consumer's perception of risk is large
      or if risk-mitigation strategies were ineffective.

TI  - Probiotics for induction of remission in Crohn's disease.
PG  - CD006634
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD006634.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease has a high morbidity and there is no known cure.
      Current treatments have multiple side effects and an effective treatment with
      minimal side effects is desired. Probiotics have been proposed as such a
      treatment but their efficacy is undetermined. There is some evidence that
      probiotics are effective in other conditions affecting the gastrointestinal tract
      and they are popular with patients. They are thought to work through competitive 
      action with commensal and pathogenic flora, influencing the immune response.
      OBJECTIVES: To determine if there is any evidence for the efficacy of probiotics 
      for the induction of remission in Crohn's disease. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane 
      Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 1, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 to
      2007), Excerpta Medica/EMBASE (1974 to 2007), CINAHL (1982-2007) and the Cochrane
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Functional Bowel Disorders Group Specialised Trial
      Register were searched. Manufacturers of probiotics were also contacted to
      identify any unpublished trials. References of trials were also searched for any 
      additional trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that
      compared probiotics against placebo or any other intervention for the induction
      of remission in Crohn's disease were eligible for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND 
      ANALYSIS: Data extraction and assessment of methodological quality of included
      studies were independently performed by two authors. The main outcome measure was
      the occurrence of clinical remission. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals
      were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: One small study (n = 11) 
      met the inclusion criteria and was included in the review. There were some
      methodological concerns with this study. Four of 5 patients in the probiotic
      group achieved remission compared to 5 of 6 in the placebo group (OR 0.80; 95% CI
      0.04 to 17.20). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to make any 
      conclusions about the efficacy of probiotics for induction of remission in
      Crohn's disease. There is a lack of well designed RCTs in this area and further
      research is needed.

TI  - Is there a role for bowel rest in nutrition management of Crohn's disease?
PG  - 309-17
LID - 10.1177/0884533608318674 [doi]
AB  - In 1988, Greenberg and colleagues published a large randomized controlled trial
      to address whether bowel rest could lead to improved disease activity in patients
      with active Crohn's disease. The results of this study provide substantial
      evidence that bowel rest is not necessary to achieve remission in patients with
      active Crohn's disease receiving nutrition support. Before this study, great
      controversy existed about the use of nutrition support and bowel rest in the
      treatment of active Crohn's disease because of a limited number of conflicting
      studies providing evidence for and against its application. The results of the
      publication by Greenberg et al are fundamental because they helped to settle this
      important argument. Furthermore, this pivotal paper changed the clinical
      guidelines for the use of nutrition support in the management of active Crohn's
      disease. Since the publication of this pivotal article, many developments in the 
      field of nutrition and in the treatment of Crohn's disease have helped validate
      and further its results. Subsequent studies and debate center on the use of
      enteral nutrition as primary treatment in patients with active Crohn's disease.
      Data regarding the efficacy, composition, and overall role of adult enteral
      nutrition in the management of Crohn's disease are presented. This article
      revisits the Greenberg paper and discusses some of these innovations in
      nutrition.

AB  - Nutrition and Crohn's disease (CD) are intertwined because of the central role of
      nutrition in the care of patients with CD, specifically the theories regarding a 
      dietary contribution to pathogenesis and formal studies investigating the primary
      role of nutrition as therapy for CD. Perhaps one of the most important studies
      evaluating the role of nutrition therapy and bowel rest in the management of CD
      was performed by Greenberg and colleagues in 1988. This pivotal study attempted
      to define the role of bowel rest as an independent variable in the management of 
      hospitalized patients with active CD unresponsive to the traditional medical
      therapy that was available at the time. As the first randomized controlled trial 
      evaluating nutrition intervention in CD, it showed that bowel rest was not a
      major factor in achieving remission during nutrition support and did not affect
      outcome during 1-year follow-up. Although these discouraging findings would be
      subsequently replicated, the role of enteral and parenteral nutrition therapy
      would evolve during the following years as a result of insight into CD
      pathogenesis, the emergence of more effective medical therapies, and improved
      understanding of the role of nutrition in the care of patients with CD.

PG  - 842-8
LID - 10.1080/00365520801943354 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Crohn's disease (CD) is characterized by a reduction in mucosal
      integrity that permits antigen penetration into the intestinal tissue. The
      administration of probiotics has been suggested to improve the barrier function
      of the mucosa. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of
      Saccharomyces boulardii on the intestinal permeability in CD. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: Thirty-four patients were randomized according to the Vienna
      classification for treatment with either placebo or Saccharomyces boulardii.
      Baseline medications (mesalamine, azathioprine, prednisone, metronidazole and/or 
      thalidomide) were maintained. Intestinal permeability (lactulose/mannitol ratio) 
      was evaluated immediately before the beginning of treatment and at the end of the
      first and third treatment month. Fifteen healthy volunteers were also submitted
      for the intestinal permeability test. RESULTS: In volunteers, the
      lactulose/mannitol ratio was 0.005+/-0.0037, whereas this value was 0.021+/-0.01 
      in patients with CD (p=0.001). In the placebo group, there was an increase in
      lactulose/mannitol ratio by 0.004+/-0.010 (p=0.12) at the end of the third month.
      In the S. boulardii group, there was an improvement in intestinal permeability,
      with a decrease in the lactulose/mannitol ratio by 0.008+/-0.006 (p=0.0005) in
      the same period. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CD in remission present alterations
      in the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier according to
      lactulose/mannitol ratio. S. boulardii added to baseline therapy improved
      intestinal permeability in these patients, even though complete normalization was
      not achieved.

AB  - Probiotic research and clinical trials have been forging ahead over the last
      decade. Although much has been learnt in relation to probiotic intestinal
      epithelial-mucosal immune interactions, the evidence for substantial clinical
      efficacy of probiotics continues to progress much slower. This review outlines
      the probiotic clinical studies before 2005 that formed the foundation of
      probiotic clinical trials in inflammatory bowel disease and then examines indepth
      those inflammatory bowel disease probiotic clinical trials published after 2005
      that are leading to new understanding of the role of probiotics in the induction 
      and remission of inflammatory bowel disease in humans.

TI  - Malnutrition and impaired muscle strength in patients with Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis in remission.
PG  - 694-702
LID - 10.1016/j.nut.2008.03.018 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This prospective, controlled, and multicentric study evaluated
      nutritional status, body composition, muscle strength, and quality of life in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease in clinical remission. In addition,
      possible effects of gender, malnutrition, inflammation, and previous prednisolone
      therapy were investigated. METHODS: Nutritional status (subjective global
      assessment [SGA], body mass index, albumin, trace elements), body composition
      (bioelectrical impedance analysis, anthropometry), handgrip strength, and quality
      of life were assessed in 94 patients with Crohn's disease (CD; 61 female and 33
      male, Crohn's Disease Activity Index 71 +/- 47), 50 patients with ulcerative
      colitis (UC; 33 female and 17 male, Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index 3.1 +/-
      1.5), and 61 healthy control subjects (41 female and 20 male) from centers in
      Berlin, Vienna, and Bari. For further analysis of body composition, 47
      well-nourished patients with inflammatory bowel disease were pair-matched by body
      mass index, sex, and age to healthy controls. Data are presented as median
      (25th-75th percentile). RESULTS: Most patients with inflammatory bowel disease
      (74%) were well nourished according to the SGA, body mass index, and serum
      albumin. However, body composition analysis demonstrated a decrease in body cell 
      mass (BCM) in patients with CD (23.1 kg, 20.8-28.7, P = 0.021) and UC (22.6 kg,
      21.0-28.0, P = 0.041) compared with controls (25.0 kg, 22.0-32.5). Handgrip
      strength correlated with BCM (r = 0.703, P = 0.001) and was decreased in patients
      with CD (32.8 kg, 26.0-41.1, P = 0.005) and UC (31.0 kg, 27.3-37.8, P = 0.001)
      compared with controls (36.0 kg, 31.0-52.0). The alterations were seen even in
      patients classified as well nourished. BCM was lower in patients with moderately 
      increased serum C-reactive protein levels compared with patients with normal
      levels. CONCLUSION: In CD and UC, selected micronutrient deficits and loss of BCM
      and muscle strength are frequent in remission and cannot be detected by standard 
      malnutrition screening.

TI  - Is infliximab safe to use while breastfeeding?
PG  - 3085-7
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) often affects women around the age of conception
      and pregnancy. Most drugs used to treat IBD are safe in pregnancy, but physicians
      must consider the clinical implications of certain treatment regimens in young,
      fertile females. We report an informative case of a pregnant patient with IBD who
      underwent treatment with infliximab during her pregnancy and while nursing her
      infant. Serum and breast milk infliximab levels were monitored throughout this
      time period. This case report suggests that targeted monoclonal antibodies and
      other biologic agents can be used with caution in pregnant and breastfeeding
      patients.

      Crohn's disease: a pilot study.
PG  - 960-7
LID - 10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2008.04.021 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Infliximab is the first anti-TNFalpha accepted by the Food and Drug
      Administration for use in inflammatory bowel disease treatment. Few clinical,
      biological and genetic factors tend to predict response in Crohn's disease (CD)
      patient subcategories, none widely predicting response to infliximab. DESIGN AND 
      METHODS: Twenty CD patients showing clinical response or non response to
      infliximab were used for serum proteomic profiling on Surface Enhanced Lazer
      Desorption Ionisation-Time of Flight-Mass Spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS), each
      before and after treatment. Univariate and multivariate data analysis were
      performed for prediction and characterization of response to infliximab. RESULTS:
      We obtained a model of classification predicting response to treatment and
      selected relevant potential biomarkers, among which platelet aggregation factor 4
      (PF4). We quantified PF4, sCD40L and IL-6 by ELISA for correlation studies.
      CONCLUSIONS: This first proteomic pilot study on response to infliximab in CD
      suggests association between platelet metabolism and response to infliximab and
      requires validation studies on a larger cohort of patients.

TI  - Optimisation of an enteric coated, layered multi-particulate formulation for
      ileal delivery of viable recombinant Lactococcus lactis.
PG  - 969-76
LID - 10.1016/j.ejpb.2008.02.018 [doi]
AB  - Layering of pellets with recombinant Lactococcus lactis Thy 12 was optimised for 
      the production of a dosage form with a high load of viable recombinant L. lactis.
      Shear stress induced during the atomisation and the type of carrier used for the 
      layering process did not influence the viability. A 5% lactose matrix resulted in
      the highest viability of L. lactis (8.9+/-1.7%) which could be maintained for at 
      least 12 months at -20 degrees C. A higher bacterial cell load on the pellets was
      obtained using a longer process time, but the addition of 10% skim milk was
      essential to maintain the stabilising capacity of the matrix. Increasing the load
      of viable L. lactis was also possible using a higher bacterial cell concentration
      of the layering suspension and increasing the amount of stabilising matrix to 10%
      lactose/20% skim milk, yielding a formulation with 1.7 x 10(9)cfu/100 mg pellets.
      To protect the bacteria during gastric passage and to obtain ileum targeting, the
      formulation was enteric coated with 5% Eudragit FS30D, but after coating and
      gastric residence for 2 h HCl about 1% of the bacteria remained viable.
      Application of a subcoating, previous to enteric coating, did not result in a
      higher viability.

      both animal models of IBD and in patients with IBD. The effects appear to be
      modest at best and may reflect the choice of probiotic organism, the variability 
      in concentrations of organisms administered, and the variability of the diseases 
      being treated. This review examines the data of all fully published articles
      currently available for the role of probiotics in the treatment of IBD.

TI  - The resistible growth of health care costs.
PG  - 4-14
AB  - Rather than our routinely blamed ageing demography, pharmaceutical promotion and 
      the medical business, not research, are responsible for our ever growing health
      bill. To keep essential health care affordable, only what has been proved
      necessary and cost effective should be financed by some kind of risk
      mutualisation system. Hedonistic care should be left to the free market. From
      conception to death, a devastating culture of medicalization and therapeutic
      agressivity has turned naturally inexpensive processes, such as conception,
      birth, ageing and death, into over-priced medical achievements. The increasing
      lack of personal and social responsibility triggered by the market, such as junk 
      food, tobacco, drugs, sedentarity or trash media, multiply life-threatening
      illnesses such as diabetes 2, obesity, cardiovascular diseases and all kinds of
      cancers. Screenings require millions of participants and intense statistical
      analysis to prove any efficacy. Screenings, testings and proactive practices make
      people sick and produce more patients than they save lives , while generating
      exceptional returns on investments thanks to state and insurance financing; they 
      should be put under public control. New drugs are unaffordable in spite of their 
      dubious efficacy which often relies on biased and underpowered studies. Because
      they target desperate, debilitating, up to now incurable diseases like metastatic
      cancers, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer, polyarthritis, Crohn disease, patients
      and their families want them by any means and at any price. The answer to the
      North-South health gap is in a global deal: a declining demographic trend,
      already well under way and free circulation not only of goods but also of people 
      which would in the long run shape up the age pyramid of a progressively mixed
      population. That could also save lives at both ends of the human chain: those who
      die from starvation and those who die from overfeeding.

TI  - [Treatment of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases].
PG  - 1125-41; discussion 1141
AB  - The same drugs are used to treat hemorrhagic rectocolitis (HRC) and Crohn's
      disease (CD), although the aims are very different. Aminosalicylates are highly
      beneficial in HRC but virtually ineffective in CD, a disease in which
      immunosuppressants are more useful. Aminosalicylates exert their antiinflammatory
      effect directly on the lesions. Various oral and rectal preparations have been
      developed in order to deliver the active molecule to the intestinal target
      segment. These drugs are now known to act by stimulating the nuclear receptor
      PPAR-gamma, and this knowledge should help with the development of new agents.
      Chronic aminosalicylate treatment appears to diminish the risk of malignant
      transformation. Systemic steroids are still the mainstay of treatment for
      exacerbations of HRC and CD, yielding remissions in 60 to 90% of cases. In
      contrast, systemic steroids should not be used for maintenance therapy.
      Budesonide is a preparation that selectively releases steroids in the ileocolonic
      region, thereby reducing systemic adverse effects. Immunosuppressants such as
      azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine, and also methotrexate in some cases, are used 
      for maintenance therapy of steroid-dependent and highly recurrent forms. These
      drugs stabilize the disease in about half the patients who receive them.
      Treatment typically lasts several years and necessitates regular monitoring,
      especially of hematological status. Cyclosporine is used intravenously in severe 
      HRC. Infliximab (RemicadeR), a chimeric monoclonal antibody targeting TNF is
      effective in acute forms and as maintenance therapy for CD. It was also recently 
      shown to be effective in HRC. Infliximab is indicated in steroid-resistant forms 
      and contraindicated in patients with latent systemic infections (tuberculosis,
      hepatitis B) and heart failure. Artificial nutrition is now only used in children
      with acute forms, in order to avoid the need for steroids. Probiotics might have 
      a place in maintenance treatment of HRC. Surgical treatment of HRC consists of
      colectomy or, more radically, ileoprotectomy followed by ileoanal anastomosis
      with resection: however, the likely benefits and potential complications
      (especially nocturnal diarrhea) must be carefully weighed up. Surgical treatment 
      of CD consists of resecting the worst-affected segments. As available medical and
      surgical treatments can only control these diseases, without curing them, patient
      management must be planned on a long-term basis. Control of exacerbations is
      judged on the basis of clinical parameters and biological markers of
      inflammation, rather than on lesion healing. The choice of maintenance therapy
      depends on the nature of the disease (HRC or CD) and its progressive nature.
      Surgery is reserved for patients with complicated and drug-resistant forms.

      patients with inflammatory bowel disease?
PG  - 906-12
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.200700147 [doi]
AB  - The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves an interaction
      between genetically determined host susceptibility, dysregulated immune response,
      and the enteric microbiota. Ecological treatments including probiotics,
      prebiotics, and synbiotics are actively studied in Crohn's disease (CD),
      ulcerative colitis (UC) and pouchitis. We review herein the literature on the
      rational use of probiotics in IBD considering efficacy (as evaluated in
      randomized controlled trials), mechanisms of action and safety issues. A
      probiotic effect is strictly restricted to one defined strain and cannot be
      generalized from one to another. There is evidence of efficacy of some probiotic 
      drugs in pouchitis (VSL#3), and in the prevention of recurrence of UC
      (Escherichia coli Nissle 1917). However, the evidence for efficacy of probiotic
      drugs in CD is still low as well as that of dietary ecological treatments.
      Despite an ecological (hopefully nutritional) treatment of IBD is promising, many
      questions remain unanswered and further clinical and fundamental studies are
      needed.

      disease.
PG  - 855-66
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.200700050 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by anorexia, malnutrition,
      altered body composition, and development of mesenteric white adipose tissue
      (WAT) hypertrophy. Increasing evidence suggests that adipokines synthesized
      either in WAT or in immune cells, are involved in these manifestations of IBD.
      Among adipokines leptin, adiponectin and resistin hold a fundamental role while
      the role of ghrelin in inflammation is not well established. Preliminary studies 
      have shown overexpression of leptin, adiponectin, and resistin in mesenteric WAT 
      of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and significant alterations of circulating 
      serum levels of these adipokines in IBD. It has also been demonstrated that
      intestinal inflammation causes an increase in endogenous ghrelin production. In
      animal models of intestinal inflammation, existing data suggest that leptin,
      adiponectin, and resistin are pivotal mediators of inflammation. Interesting
      therapeutic interventions based on these data have been suggested. A specific
      role for hypertrophic WAT has also been implicated in CD. Further efforts with
      experimental and clinical studies are needed to better understand the role of
      adipokines in IBD.

TI  - Microbial host interactions in IBD: implications for pathogenesis and therapy.
PG  - 497-507
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and pouchitis appear to be caused 
      by pathogenic T-cell responses to discrete antigens from the complex luminal
      microbiota, with susceptibility conferred by genetic polymorphisms that regulate 
      bacterial killing, mucosal barrier function, or immune responses. Environmental
      triggers initiate or reactivate inflammation and modulate genetic susceptibility.
      New pathogenesis concepts include defective bacterial killing by innate immune
      cells in CD, colonization of the ileum in CD with functionally abnormal
      Escherichia coli that adhere to and invade epithelial cells and resist bacterial 
      killing, and alterations in enteric microbiota composition in CD, UC, and
      pouchitis detected by molecular probes. The considerable therapeutic potential of
      manipulating the enteric microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease patients has
      not been realized, probably due to failure to recognize heterogenic disease
      mechanisms that require individualized use of antibiotics, probiotics,
      prebiotics, combination therapies, and genetically engineered bacteria to restore
      mucosal homeostasis.

TI  - Orofacial granulomatosis: review on aetiology and pathogenesis.
PG  - 191-5
LID - 10.1111/j.1600-0714.2007.00591.x [doi]
AB  - Orofacial granulomatosis (OFG) is considered as an uncommon disease and
      nomenclature of the disease was subjected to debate for a long time. Although
      various aetiological agents such as food substances, food additives, dental
      materials and various microbiological agents have been implicated in the disease 
      process its precise pathogenesis is yet to be elucidated. Delayed type of
      hypersensitivity reaction appears to play a significant role, although the exact 
      antigen inducing the immunological reaction varies in individual patients.
      However, evidence for the role of genetic predisposition to the disease is
      sparse. The underlying immunological mechanism appears to show some similarities 
      between OFG and Crohn's disease, emphasizing the need for more comparative
      studies of the two entities. Therefore, we propose the term idiopathic OFG as a
      better term for those cases restricted to oral region without any identifiable
      known granulomatous disease and the diagnosis should not be changed until the
      patient develops systemic manifestations of a specific granulomatous condition.
      This review attempts to discuss the role of different aetiological agents and
      certain aspects of pathogenesis of OFG.

TI  - A meta-analysis on the efficacy of probiotics for maintenance of remission and
      prevention of clinical and endoscopic relapse in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 2524-31

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether probiotics maintain remission in patients with
      Crohn's disease (CD). DESIGN: A meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials.
      METHODS: PUBMED and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched 
      for clinical trial studies investigated the efficacy of probiotics for the
      maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. Clinical relapse and endoscopic
      relapse were the key outcomes of interest. Data were searched within the time
      period of 1966 through May 2007. RESULT: Eight randomized placebo-controlled
      clinical trials met our criteria and were included in the analysis. Seven
      determined clinical relapse and three evaluated endoscopic relapse among patients
      with CD received probiotics for maintenance of remission. Pooling of seven trials
      for the outcome of clinical relapse yielded an odds ratio of 0.92 (95% confidence
      interval of 0.52-1.62, P = 0.8853), a nonsignificant odds ratio. The odds ratio
      for three studies for the outcome of endoscopic relapse was 0.97 (95% confidence 
      interval of 0.54-1.78, P = 0.93), a nonsignificant odds ratio. CONCLUSION: This
      meta-analysis fails to demonstrate the efficacy of probiotics in maintaining
      remission and preventing clinical and endoscopic recurrence in CD. It is
      suggested to use probiotic preparations containing a mixture of lactobacillus
      with E. coli or Saccharomyces.

TI  - Evidence for the involvement of infectious agents in the pathogenesis of Crohn's 
      disease.
PG  - 845-52
AB  - Many advances have been made in the understanding of Crohn's disease (CD)
      pathogenesis during the last decade. CD is currently seen as a predominantly
      T-lymphocyte-driven disease characterized by the presence of a complex cocktail
      of interacting cytokines, chemokines and other mediators produced by a variety of
      cell types. Prevailing theories of CD pathogenesis suggest that patients'
      T-lymphocytes are inappropriately activated in the setting of an immune
      imbalance, which is itself caused by an unfortunate confluence of genetic and
      environmental factors. The T-cell response then leads to the chronic inflammation
      characteristic for the disease. Various environmental factors may play a role in 
      the development of CD, but microbes are most consistently implied. This theory is
      based on epidemiological, clinicopathological, genetic and experimental evidence.
      Despite the abundance of arguments for the implication of bacteria in the
      aetiopathogenesis of CD, the precise role of bacteria in this disease still
      remains elusive. Three not necessarily mutually exclusive theories have been
      proposed: (1) an unidentified persistent pathogen; (2) an abnormally permeable
      mucosal barrier leading to excessive bacterial translocation; and (3) a breakdown
      in the balance between putative "protective" versus "harmful" intestinal bacteria
      ("dysbiosis"). At present, one cannot exclude with certainty any of these three
      proposed hypotheses; they may all apply to CD to a certain extent.

TI  - Curcumin in cancer management: recent results of analogue design and clinical
      studies and desirable future research.
PG  - 1005-9
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.200700148 [doi]
AB  - The ability of the curry constituent curcumin to delay the onset of cancer has
      been the topic of extensive research for many years. Abundant literature is
      devoted to mechanisms by which curcumin may mediate this activity. These insights
      have prompted investigations in which curcumin as lead molecule serves as a
      scaffold for synthetic chemical attempts to optimize pharmacological potency.
      Among the published analogues with notable efficacy are dimethylcurcumin,
      1,5-bis(3-pyridyl)-1,4-pentadien-3-one and
      3,5-bis-(2-fluorobenzylidene)-piperidinium-4-one acetate. Results of a small
      number of clinical pilot studies conducted with curcumin at doses of up to 12 g
      suggest tentatively that it is safe in humans. Prevention of adenoma recurrence
      constitutes a clinical paradigm worthy of further investigation for curcumin.
      Future clinical study should include measurement of mechanism-based
      pharmacodynamic parameters.

TI  - Wireless capsule endoscopy: indications, limitations, and future challenges.
PG  - 4-12
AB  - Wireless capsule endoscopy is one of the recent inventions that has made an
      impact in the diagnostic work-up of gastrointestinal diseases, mainly in small
      intestinal pathology, the part of the gut that cannot be totally visualized by
      upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy. Since the first report documenting
      the use of capsule endoscopy, many adult clinical trials have taken place.
      Although the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of the capsule in
      children (ages 10-18 years) in October 2003, few small clinical trials exploring 
      the diagnostic yield of capsule endoscopy in pediatric populations have been
      published.

TI  - The use of a nursing model to understand diarrhea and the role of probiotics in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 418-23; quiz 424-5
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease, an umbrella term used for Crohn disease and
      ulcerative colitis, is often accompanied with the presenting symptom of diarrhea.
      This symptom can be a great nuisance and emotionally distressing to the
      individual with inflammatory bowel disease. Although the exact etiology of
      inflammatory bowel disease is still unknown, interactions between the host
      susceptibility, mucosal immunity, and intestinal microflora are thought to be
      major factors. One intervention that is gaining increasing support by the
      research and medical community is the use of probiotics, which work on the
      intestinal flora by altering the bacterial composition and thereby rendering the 
      environment unfavorable to pathogenic organisms. The human response to illness
      model provides an ideal organizing framework to gain a comprehensive
      understanding of the human response of diarrhea in the inflammatory bowel disease
      population. By examining the physiological, pathophysiological, behavioral, and
      experiential perspectives as well as individual vulnerabilities, this model
      establishes sound rationale to guide nursing interventions to help the individual
      better cope with the physical and emotional effects of having diarrhea. This
      model also facilitates the provision of holistic and personalized care, which may
      include the use of probiotics to help alleviate this distressing symptom.

TI  - Dietary patterns and risk for Crohn's disease in children.
PG  - 367-73
AB  - BACKGROUND: Some dietary foods are considered protective (vegetables and fruits),
      whereas others (fatty foods) are thought to enhance the risk for Crohn's disease 
      (CD). The evidence, however, is inconsistent. METHODS: We postulated that
      specific dietary patterns may influence the risk for CD. A case-control study was
      carried out. Newly diagnosed CD cases with population and/or hospital-based
      controls < or =20 years were selected from 3 tertiary hospitals across Canada.
      Pre-disease diet was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire
      (FFQ) administered within 1 month of diagnosis. Factor analyses and unconditional
      logistic regression (adjusted) was used to determine gender-specific dietary
      patterns and assess associated risks for CD. Odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 
      95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated. RESULTS: A total of 149 cases 
      and 251 controls were included. The mean age (range) of the cases was 13.3
      (2.6-20 years). There were more boys (61.1%). Four dietary patterns each were
      observed among both boys and girls. Pattern 1 in girls, characterized by meats,
      fatty foods, and desserts, was positively associated with CD (OR 4.7, 95% CI
      1.6-14.2). Pattern 2, common to both boys and girls, was characterized by
      vegetables, fruits, olive oil, fish, grains, and nuts and was inversely
      associated with CD in both genders (girls: OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.9; boys: OR 0.2, 
      95% CI 0.1-0.5). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that specific dietary patterns 
      could be associated with higher or lower risks for CD in children. Larger
      prospective studies are required to confirm these findings.

TI  - [Changes in lipid metabolism in patients in the active phase of Crohn's disease].
PG  - 1035-9
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Crohn's disease (CD) in its active period is accompanied by a
      decreased food intake and deterioration in water, mineral and metabolic balance. 
      Lipid metabolism is known to be altered in many acute diseases, and
      hypocholesterolemia is a serious negative prognostic indicator. The causes of
      decreased serum cholesterol concentration are multiple. Simultaneous affection of
      both cholesterol synthesis and absorption has been reported in many sources. The 
      changes in both the above processes can be quantified with the use of specific
      indicators of synthesis (cholesterol level) and absorption (sitosterol and
      campesterol levels). OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to demonstrate
      changes in lipid metabolism in patients with active Crohn's disease, and to find 
      out to what extent the above phenomenon is influenced by the affection of the
      process of cholesterol synthesis and/or absorption in the case of detected
      hypocholesterolemia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Total serum cholesterol, LDL- and
      HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels were measured on the 3rd, 14th and 28th
      day from admission in addition to admission analyses in 24 patients with acute
      manifestation of CD (CDAI - Cohn's disease activity index - over 150). Also
      measured were the concentrations ofsqualene, lathosterol, sitosterol and
      campesterol. The results were compared with a control sample of 100 voluntary
      blood donors. The obtained data was processed using the Sigma-stat 3.1
      statistical software. RESULTS: Decreased levels of all basic lipid metabolism
      parameters were detected. At the same time, a statistically significant decrease 
      in the levels of lathosterol and camposterol was recorded. The decrease in
      sitosterol levels was insignificant and the level of squalene was higher than in 
      the controls. CONCLUSION: Significant changes in lipid metabolism were
      demonstrated in the study in patients in active phase of Crohn's disease. Also
      detected was statistically significant hypocholesterolemia, with altered process 
      of cholesterol synthesis and absorption.

TI  - Differential clustering of bowel biopsy-associated bacterial profiles of
      specimens collected in Mexico and Canada: what do these profiles represent?
PG  - 111-7
AB  - Bowel commensals appear to be an important source of antigens that drive the
      chronic immune inflammation characteristic of Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis [inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)]. Biopsy-associated bacteria are
      assumed to be particularly relevant in bacteriological investigations of IBD
      because they are assumed to be located on the mucosal surface and hence close to 
      immunological cells. This investigation analysed the bacterial collections
      associated with bowel biopsies, aspirates of residual fluid after bowel cleansing
      and faeces from IBD patients and non-IBD subjects in Edmonton, Canada, and Mexico
      City, Mexico. Temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis of 16S rRNA gene 
      sequences produced profiles of the bacterial collections and their similarities
      were compared. Similarity analysis showed that the profiles did not cluster
      according to disease status, but that Canadian and Mexican profiles could be
      differentiated by this method. Comparison of biopsy, aspirate and faecal samples 
      obtained from the same subject showed that, on average, the profiles were highly 
      similar. Therefore, biopsy-associated bacteria are likely to represent, at least 
      in part, contaminants from the fluid, which resembles a faecal solution, that
      pools in the bowel after cleansing prior to endoscopy.

TI  - The evidence for Mycobacterium paratuberculosis in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 17-21
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Though long hypothesized, the putative link between
      Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis and Crohn's disease remains neither
      confirmed nor refuted. This article reviews published contributions that directly
      or indirectly address this question. RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiologic studies,
      looking for M. avium paratuberculosis DNA in Crohn's tissue, show a strong
      association between the agent and this disease. Supporting data, however, are
      presently inconclusive on a causal role. Genetic studies provide indirect support
      for a role of mycobacteria in Crohn's disease, by identifying susceptibility
      genes that encode proteins implicated in innate immunity to intracellular
      bacteria. Clinical trial data support at least a short-term benefit for
      antimycobacterial therapy in Crohn's disease, but the microbial specificity of
      this response is presently unknown. SUMMARY: There appears to be a strong
      association between M. avium paratuberculosis and Crohn's disease, but the
      causality of this association is unknown. Consequently, the therapeutic
      implications of this association require further study. A number of critical
      questions about the biology of M. avium paratuberculosis remain unanswered. Data 
      from studies of this organism, and its interaction with the immune system, can
      help address proposed reasons for or against a role of M. avium paratuberculosis 
      in the etiology of Crohn's disease.

TI  - Dietary antigens in Crohn's disease: antibodies to porcine pancreatic amylase.
PG  - 656-64
AB  - OBJECTIVES: There is no clear evidence that dietary proteins aggravate Crohn's
      disease (CD). We aimed to clarify the antibody response to dietary proteins in
      CD. METHODS: Antibody to porcine pancreatic amylase (PPA) a protease-resistant
      dietary protein (anti-PPA), was examined in CD patients (N = 104), ulcerative
      colitis (UC) patients (N = 85), and healthy controls (N = 83), and its
      relationship with the clinical characteristics of CD was investigated. Antibodies
      to casein and ovalbumin, anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA), and
      antibodies to I2 from Pseudomonas fluorescens (anti-I2) were also examined.
      RESULTS: Thirty-eight percent (39/104) of the CD patients expressed anti-PPA
      antibodies, and this percentage was significantly higher as compared with the
      control group (5%, 4/83) and the UC group (9%, 8/85) (P < 0.001). A significantly
      higher level of anti-PPA antibodies was detected in patients with "small bowel
      disease-dominant" CD than in those with "colitis-dominant" CD (P < 0.05).
      Antibodies to casein and ovalbumin were not specifically expressed in CD
      patients. As ASCA was detected in 33% and anti-I2 in 46% of the CD patients, 72% 
      of the CD patients were found positive for at least one of the three antibodies
      including anti-PPA antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: CD patients showed a specific
      antibody response to PPA, as compared with UC patients and controls. There was a 
      significantly higher level of anti-PPA antibody in patients with "small bowel
      disease-dominant" CD, suggesting that dietary proteins could play a role in the
      inflammatory response in CD patients with small bowel disease. Anti-PPA
      antibodies combined with ASCA/anti-I2 may be useful for the diagnosis of CD.

PG  - 2350-4
AB  - Probiotics are bacteria or fungi, which modulate pathogenic growth and invasion
      of the bowel. The most frequently used are Lactobacillus and Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae. They are widely used as dietary supplements or for the treatment and 
      prevention of various types of diarrhoea. Probiotics are generally considered as 
      safe, but some cases of invasive infections have been described in different
      patient populations. This article reviews the literature about the indications
      and risks of probiotics, especially in immunocompromised patients.

TI  - Dietary microparticles and their impact on tolerance and immune responsiveness of
      the gastrointestinal tract.
PG  - S59-63
AB  - Dietary microparticles are non-biological bacterial-sized particles of the
      gastrointestinal lumen that occur due to endogenous formation (calcium phosphate)
      or following oral exposure (exogenous microparticle). In the UK, about 40 mg
      (10(12)) of exogenous microparticles are ingested per person per day, through
      exposure to food additives, pharmaceutical/supplement excipients or toothpaste
      constituents. Once ingested, exogenous microparticles are unlikely to pass
      through the gastrointestinal tract without adsorbing to their surfaces some ions 
      and molecules of the intestinal lumen. Both entropy and ionic attraction drive
      such interactions. Calcium ions are especially well adsorbed by dietary
      microparticles which then provide a positively charged surface for the attraction
      (adsorption) of other organic molecules such as lipopolysaccharides,
      peptidoglycans or protein antigen from the diet or commensal flora. The major
      (but not only) sites of microparticle entry into intestinal tissue are the M-cell
      rich lymphoid aggregates (termed Peyer's patches in the small bowel). Indeed, it 
      is well established that this is an efficient transport route for non-biological 
      microparticles although it is unclear why. We hypothesise that this pathway
      exists for "endogenous microparticles" of calcium phosphate, with immunological
      and physiological benefit, and that "exogenous dietary microparticles", such as
      titanium dioxide and the silicates, hijack this route. This overview focuses on
      what is known of these microparticles and outlines their potential role in immune
      tolerance of the gut (endogenous microparticles) or immune activation (exogenous 
      microparticles) and inflammation of the gut.

TI  - Probiotics in the management of colonic disorders.
PG  - 434-40
AB  - Probiotics have been used in humans for almost a century and widely recommended
      for the treatment of a variety of ills assumed to be of colonic origin, including
      diarrhea, constipation, bloating, and flatulence. More recently, probiotics have 
      been evaluated in the management of specific colonic disorders such as
      inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and Clostridium difficile
      colitis. It is evident that no two probiotics are exactly alike; why then should 
      we expect reproducible results from studies that employ different species or
      strains, variable formulations, and diverse dosing schedules? When probiotics
      have been studied with the rigor appropriate to a new therapeutic modality, some 
      coherent results have emerged: specific strains are effective in certain
      diarrheal states, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis, as
      well as in the prevention of C. difficile-related colitis. Even here, not to
      mention other colonic disorders, further adequately powered and appropriately
      designed trials are needed.

TI  - [The role of translational research in inflammatory bowel disease].
PG  - 146-53
AB  - The idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases, broadly classified as either Crohn's 
      disease or ulcerative colitis, are caused by a dysregulated mucosal immune
      response to a luminal antigen, possibly a bacterium, in a genetically predisposed
      host. A rapid expansion of knowledge in recent years has greatly increased our
      understanding of the pathophysiology of these disorders. For example, the
      relatively recent discovery of the NOD2 gene, a protein involved in bacterial
      sensing, has provided further evidence of the complex interplay between hosts and
      microbes in Crohn's disease. Significant recent advances have also occurred with 
      the discovery of the role of Toll-like receptors and dendritic cells in the
      development of gut inflammation, and the role of proinflammatory cytokines in the
      development and potentiation of gut inflammation. This article presents an update
      on these key developments and emphasizes the translational aspects of research
      that are directly related to patient care.

PG  - 2572S-2575S
LID - 10.1093/jn/137.11.2572S [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, also called chronic inflammatory bowel
      diseases (IBD), affect up to 500 per 100,000 persons in the Western world. Recent
      studies in the etiology of IBD suggest that these diseases are caused by a
      combination of genetic, environmental, and immunological factors. Results from
      humans and especially animal models of colitis reported by our group and others
      have indicated that these diseases result from a lack of tolerance to resident
      intestinal bacteria in genetically susceptible hosts. Probiotic bacteria have
      health-promoting effects for the host when ingested and have also shown efficacy 
      in ulcerative colitis and refractory pouchitis. In light of the efficacy of
      providing probiotic bacteria to patients with IBD, there has been interest in the
      prophylactic and therapeutic potential of inulin, oligofructose, and other
      prebiotics for patients with or at risk of IBD. Prebiotics are nondigestible
      dietary oligosaccharides that affect the host by selectively stimulating growth, 
      activity, or both of selective intestinal (probiotic) bacteria. Prebiotics are
      easy to administer and, in contrast to probiotic therapy, do not require
      administration of large amounts of (live) bacteria and are therefore easier to
      administer. Studies using prebiotics, especially beta-fructan oligosaccharides,
      for the treatment of chronic intestinal inflammation have shown benefit in animal
      models of colitis. Studies using these prebiotics alone or in combination with
      probiotics are emerging and have shown promise. These dietary therapies could
      lead to novel treatments for these chronic debilitating diseases.

TI  - Innate immunity in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 5577-80
AB  - The human intestinal tract is home to an enormous bacterial flora. The host
      defense against microorganisms can be divided into innate and adaptive immunity. 
      The former is the most immediate line of response to immunologic challenges
      presented by bacteria, viruses, and fungi. The mucosal immune system has evolved 
      to balance the need to respond to pathogens while co-existing with commensal
      bacteria and food antigens. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), this
      hyporesponsiveness or tolerance breaks down and inflammation supervenes driven by
      the intestinal microbial flora. Bacteria contain compounds and are recognized by 
      a variety of receptors, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and NODs (a family
      of intracellular bacterial sensors) and are potent stimuli of innate immune
      responses. Several mutations in these receptors have been associated with
      development of IBD.

TI  - Nutrigenomics in the whole-genome scanning era: Crohn's disease as example.
PG  - 3105-18
AB  - Nutrigenomics has the potential to tailor diets to optimize health, based on
      knowledge of key genetic polymorphisms. Identification of candidate genes is
      often based on a priori knowledge of disease processes. However, genome-wide
      association methods are not only validating previously identified genes and
      polymorphisms, but also revealing new gene-disease associations not anticipated
      from prior knowledge. In Crohn's disease (CD), such studies not only confirm the 
      importance of caspase-activated recruitment domain 15 and major
      histocompatibility complex II molecules, but also reveal strong associations with
      the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-23 receptor and autophagy-related
      16-like gene. Genes identified to date in CD can be linked into two interrelated 
      pathways: receptor-mediated cytokine induction or autophagocytosis. New genomic
      technologies need to be matched with innovative methodologies to characterize the
      likely impact of foods and to take the field to another dimension of value for
      human diet development and optimized health.

TI  - Review article: the evidence base for interventions used to maintain remission in
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 11-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is characterised by recurrent flare-ups alternating
      with periods of remission. A number of interventions are currently used in
      clinical practice to try and maintain remission in Crohn's disease but the
      evidence base for some of them may be questionable. AIM: To review the available 
      evidence on interventions, which are currently used to maintain remission in
      Crohn's disease. METHODS: The Cochrane Library and Medline (Pubmed) were searched
      for level 1 evidence on specific interventions. Search terms included 'Crohn's
      disease or synonyms', 'remission or synonyms' and the names of specific
      interventions. RESULTS: Azathioprine, infliximab and adalimumab are effective at 
      maintaining remission in Crohn's disease. Natalizumab is also effective, but
      there are concerns about its potential association with progressive multifocal
      leukoencephalopathy. Long-term enteral nutritional supplementation,
      enteric-coated omega-3 fatty acids and intramuscular methotrexate may also be
      effective but the evidence for these is based on relatively small studies. The
      available evidence does not support the use of oral 5-aminosalicylates agents,
      corticosteroids, anti-mycobacterial agents, probiotics or ciclosporin as
      maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease. CONCLUSION: A better understanding of the
      evidence base of existing interventions could result in the use of treatments,
      which are more likely to lead to improved patient outcomes.

TI  - The mechanism of action of probiotics.
PG  - 679-92
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Probiotics are a heterogeneous group of nonpathologic bacteria
      that are functionally defined by their ability to allay inflammation when
      introduced into the inflamed intestine. The purpose of this review is to discuss 
      recent data bearing on the possible mechanisms of action of these bacteria, with 
      a particular focus on the relation of these mechanisms to the pathogenesis of
      inflammatory bowel disease, their main arena of use. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies of 
      probiotic activity in recent years provide evidence that probiotics counter
      experimental and human gastrointestinal inflammation (human inflammatory bowel
      disease) by their effects on epithelial cell function, including epithelial cell 
      barrier function, epithelial cytokine secretion, and their antibacterial effects 
      relating to colonization of the epithelial layer. In addition, there is emerging 
      evidence that probiotics induce regulatory T cells that act as a break on the
      effector T cells that would otherwise cause inflammation. SUMMARY: This review of
      probiotics and inflammatory bowel disease marshals support for the concept that
      administration of probiotics ameliorates inflammation by exerting positive
      effects on the epithelial cell dysfunction and mucosal immune system dysfunction 
      that forms the basis of the inflammation.

TI  - Impacts of long-term enteral nutrition on clinical and endoscopic disease
      activities and mucosal cytokines during remission in patients with Crohn's
      disease: a prospective study.
PG  - 1493-501
AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term enteral nutrition may maintain clinical and endoscopic
      remission in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this prospective
      study was to investigate the impacts of long-term enteral nutrition on clinical
      and endoscopic disease activities and mucosal tissue cytokines in patients with
      quiescent CD. METHODS: Forty patients with CD who achieved clinical remission
      were included. Of these, 20 received continuous elemental diet (Elental) infusion
      during the nighttime and a low-fat diet during the daytime (EN group) and 20
      received neither nutritional therapy nor food restriction (non-EN group). With
      these regimens, all 40 patients were monitored for 1 year. Further,
      ileocolonoscopy was performed at entry, at 6 and 12 months, and mucosal biopsies 
      were taken for cytokine assays. RESULTS: On an intention-to-treat basis, 5
      patients (25%) in the EN group and 13 (65%) in the non-EN group had a clinical
      relapse during the 1-year observation (P = 0.03). The mean endoscopic
      inflammation (EI) scores were not significantly different between the groups at
      both entry and 6 months, but at 12 months EI scores were significantly higher in 
      the non-EN group than in the EN group (P = 0.04). Additionally, the mucosal
      tissue interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha levels
      significantly increased with time in the non-EN group (entry versus 12 months,
      IL-1beta, P = 0.02; IL-6, P = 0.002; TNF-alpha, P = 0.001). In the EN group these
      cytokines did not show a significant increase. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term enteral
      nutrition in patients with quiescent CD has a clear suppressive effect on
      clinical and endoscopic disease activities and the mucosal inflammatory cytokine 
      levels.

TI  - Dietary microparticles implicated in Crohn's disease can impair macrophage
      phagocytic activity and act as adjuvants in the presence of bacterial stimuli.
PG  - 353-61
AB  - OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: Western diets regularly expose the gastrointestinal tract
      (GI) to large quantities ( > 10(12)/day) of man-made, submicron-sized, particles 
      derived from food additives and excipients. These are taken up by M cells,
      accumulate in gut macrophages, and may influence the aetiology of inflammatory
      bowel diseases (IBD). MATERIALS: We investigated the effects of common dietary
      microparticles on the function of macrophages from healthy donors or active
      Crohn's disease (CD) patients. METHODS: Macrophages were incubated for 24 h with 
      microparticles before being assayed for cytokine production and phagocytic
      activity. RESULTS: Microparticles alone were non-stimulatory but, in the presence
      of bacterial antigens such as LPS, they could act as adjuvants to induce potent
      cytokine responses. Uptake of high concentrations of microparticles also impaired
      macrophage phagocytic capacity - but not their ability - to take up 2microM
      fluorescent beads. CONCLUSIONS: While dietary microparticles alone have limited
      effects on basic macrophage functions, their ability to act as adjuvants could
      aggravate ongoing inflammatory responses towards bacterial antigens in the GI
      tract.

TI  - Aluminum is a potential environmental factor for Crohn's disease induction:
      extended hypothesis.
PG  - 329-45
AB  - Aluminum (Al) is a common environmental compound with immune-adjuvant activity
      and granulomatous inflammation inducer. Al exposure in food, additives, air,
      pharmaceuticals, and water pollution is ubiquitous in Western culture. Crohn's
      disease (CD) is a chronic relapsing intestinal inflammation in genetically
      susceptible individuals and is influenced by yet unidentified environmental
      factors. It is hypothesized, in the present review, that Al is a potential factor
      for induction or maintaining the inflammation in CD. Epidemiologically, CD
      incidence is higher in urban areas, where microparticle pollution is prevalent.
      Al immune activities share many characteristics with the immune pathology of CD: 
      increased antigen presentation and APCs activation, many luminal bacterial or
      dietary compounds can be adsorbed to the metal and induce Th1 profile activity,
      promotion of humoral and cellular immune responses, proinflammatory, apoptotic,
      oxidative activity, and stress-related molecule expression enhancement, affecting
      intestinal bacterial composition and virulence, granuloma formation, colitis
      induction in an animal model of CD, and terminal ileum uptake. The Al-bacterial
      interaction, the microparticles homing the intestine together with the extensive 
      immune activity, put Al as a potential environmental candidate for CD induction
      and maintenance.

TI  - Adequacy of nutritional intake in a Canadian population of patients with Crohn's 
      disease.
PG  - 1575-80
AB  - Crohn's disease is frequently associated with nutritional deficiencies, often a
      result of disease activity and poor oral intake. This study investigated the
      adequacy of dietary intake, based on the Canadian Dietary Reference Intake, in
      ambulatory patients with Crohn's disease and a normal body mass index (BMI;
      calculated as kg/m(2)). This was a cross-sectional study of 74 patients with mean
      age of 35.7+/-1.4 years and BMI of 23.05+/-0.45. All patients completed a 7-day
      food record and a diary for the Crohn's Disease Activity Index. Mean Crohn's
      Disease Activity Index was 138.99+/-11.38. Energy and protein intakes were within
      the recommended levels of intake, but total carbohydrates, fat, and saturated fat
      intake exceeded the recommended levels of <55%, <35%, and <10% in 39.2%, 27%, and
      59.5% of the patients, respectively. Micronutrient intakes were suboptimal most
      notably for folate, vitamins C, E, and calcium. There were no substantial
      differences between patients with active and inactive disease in terms of failure
      to meet the Dietary Reference Intake. In conclusion, in this population sample, a
      large number of ambulatory patients with Crohn's disease have suboptimal dietary 
      patterns despite a normal BMI and inactive disease. Dietary counseling and
      supplementation may be warranted in this patient population.

TI  - High dose probiotic and prebiotic cotherapy for remission induction of active
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1199-204
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical trials of probiotic treatment for Crohn's disease (CD) have 
      yielded conflicting results. This study assessed the clinical usefulness of
      combined probiotic and prebiotic therapy in the treatment of active CD. METHOD:
      Ten active CD outpatients without history of operation for CD were enrolled.
      Their mean (+/-SD) age was 27 +/- 7 years and the main symptoms presented were
      diarrhea and abdominal pain. Patients' initial therapeutic regimen of
      aminosalicylates and prednisolone failed to achieve remission. Patients were thus
      initiated on a synbiotic therapy, consisting of both probiotics (75 billion
      colony forming units [CFU] daily) and prebiotics (psyllium 9.9 g daily).
      Probiotics mainly comprised Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. Patients were free
      to adjust their intake of probiotics or prebiotics throughout the trial. Crohn's 
      disease activity index (CDAI), International Organization for the Study of
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IOIBD) score and blood sample variables were
      evaluated and compared before and after the trial. RESULTS: The duration of the
      trial was 13.0 +/- 4.5 months. By the end of therapy, each patient had taken a 45
      +/- 24 billion CFU daily probiotic dose, with six patients taking an additional
      7.9 +/- 3.6 g daily psyllium dose. Seven patients had improved clinical symptoms 
      following combined probiotic and prebiotic therapy. Both CDAI and IOIBD scores
      were significantly reduced after therapy (255-136, P = 0.009; 3.5-2.1, P = 0.03, 
      respectively). Six patients had a complete response, one had a partial response, 
      and three were non-responders. Two patients were able to discontinue their
      prednisolone therapy, while four patients decreased their intake. There were no
      adverse events. CONCLUSION: High-dose probiotic and prebiotic cotherapy can be
      safely and effectively used for the treatment of active CD.

TI  - Evidence for the use of probiotics and prebiotics in inflammatory bowel disease: 
      a review of clinical trials.
PG  - 307-15
AB  - Human subjects and their enteric microbiota have evolved together to reach a
      state of mutual tolerance. Mounting evidence from both animal models and human
      studies suggests that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents a malfunction
      of this relationship. The enteric microecology therefore represents an attractive
      therapeutic target with few side effects. Probiotics and prebiotics have been
      investigated in clinical trials as treatments for IBD, with conflicting results. 
      The evidence for the use of probiotics in the management of pouchitis is
      persuasive and several studies indicate their effectiveness in ulcerative
      colitis. Trials of probiotics and prebiotics in Crohn's disease are less
      convincing. However, methodologies vary widely and a range of probiotic,
      prebiotic and combination (synbiotic) treatments have been tested in a variety of
      patient groups with an assortment of end points. Conclusions about any one
      treatment in a specific patient group can therefore only be drawn on evidence
      from relatively small numbers of patients. The present article reviews the role
      of the intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBD and addresses the
      clinical evidence for the therapeutic manipulation of bowel microbiota using
      probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics in IBD.

TI  - Enteral nutrition for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease.
PG  - CD005984
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prevention of relapse is a major issue in the management of Crohn's
      disease. Corticosteroids and 5-ASA preparations are not effective for the
      maintenance of remission. Methotrexate, infliximab, 6-mercaptopurine and its
      prodrug, azathioprine may be effective in maintaining remission, but these drugs 
      may cause significant adverse events. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a systematic review 
      to evaluate the efficacy of enteral nutrition for the maintenance of remission in
      Crohn's disease. SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE (1966 to January 2007), EMBASE (1984 to
      January 2007) the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from the
      Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2006) and the IBD/FBD Review Group Specialized Trials 
      Register were searched. The articles cited in each publication were hand
      searched. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials which compared enteral
      nutrition with no intervention, placebo or with any other intervention were
      eligible for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data extraction and
      assessment of methodological quality of included studies were independently
      performed by two authors. The main outcome measure was the occurrence of clinical
      or endoscopic relapse as defined by the primary studies. Odds ratios and 95%
      confidence intervals were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: Two 
      studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria and were included in the 
      review. Statistical pooling of the results of these studies was not possible
      because the control interventions, and the way outcomes were assessed differed
      greatly between the two studies. In one study (Takagi 2006), patients who
      received half of their total daily calorie requirements as elemental diet and the
      remaining half by normal diet had a significantly lower relapse rate compared to 
      patients who received unrestricted normal diet (9 of 26 versus 16 of 25; OR 0.3, 
      95% CI 0.09 to 0.94). In the other study (Verma 2001), elemental and polymeric
      feeds (providing between 35 and 50% of patients' pretrial calorie intake in
      addition to unrestricted normal food) were equally effective for maintenance of
      remission and allowing withdrawal of steroid therapy (8 of 19 versus 6 of 14; OR 
      0.97, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.92). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence suggests
      that supplementary enteral nutritional may be effective for maintenance of
      remission in Crohn's disease. Whilst larger studies are needed to confirm these
      findings, enteral nutritional supplementation could be considered as an
      alternative or as an adjunct to maintenance drug therapy in Crohn's disease.

TI  - Imbalances in dietary consumption of fatty acids, vegetables, and fruits are
      associated with risk for Crohn's disease in children.
PG  - 2016-25
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The role of dietary factors in the etiology of Crohn's
      disease (CD) is inconsistent largely due to difficulties in acquiring valid
      information on consumption habits. We examined the impact of diet on new onset CD
      in children using a validated food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ). METHODOLOGY: A 
      case-control study was carried out. Children < or =20 yr, newly diagnosed with
      CD, were recruited from 3 pediatric gastroenterology clinics across Canada.
      Population or hospital controls were selected matched to cases for time of
      diagnosis (+/-6 months) and area of residence. Dietary consumption 1 yr prior to 
      disease diagnosis was evaluated using a validated FFQ, administered within 1
      month of diagnosis. Conditional logistic regression analysis adjusting for
      potential confounding variables (energy intake, age, gender, body mass index) was
      carried out. RESULTS: A total of 130 CD patients and 202 controls were studied.
      Mean age at diagnosis (+/-SD) was 14.2 (2.7). There were more male patients
      (59%). Comparing the highest to the lowest levels of consumption, higher amounts 
      of vegetables (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.33-1.44, P= 0.03), fruits (OR 0.49, 95% CI
      0.25-0.96, P= 0.02), fish (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.20-1.06, P= 0.02), and dietary fiber
      (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.04-0.37, P < 0.001) protected from CD. Consumption of
      long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (LCN-omega-3) was negatively associated with CD
      (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.19-1.00, P < 0.001). A higher ratio of LCN-omega-3/omega-6
      fatty acids was significantly associated with lower risks for CD (OR 0.32, 95% CI
      0.14-0.71, P= 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that an imbalance in
      consumption of fatty acids, vegetables, and fruits is associated with increased
      risks for CD among Canadian children.

TI  - [Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis in food and its relationship with
      Crohn's disease].
PG  - 57-68
AB  - Paratuberculosis or Johne's disease is a chronic enteritis of the cattle and
      other small ruminant animals caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp.
      paratuberculosis. In Argentina, the strains were characterized in beef and dairy 
      cattle and deer in different genetic patterns by molecular tools. M. avium subsp.
      paratuberculosis has been linked in men to a chronic inflammation of the
      intestine, named Crohn's disease. There is clinical and experimental evidence to 
      link M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis with Crohn's disease by PCR, positive
      bacteriological culture from mother milk, blood and affected tissues by in situ
      hybridization. The milk and sub-products might be one of the possible infection
      sources and it has been suggested that M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis could
      resist pasteurization. Several works showed that this mycobacteria could be
      present in retail milk of countries such as United Kingdom, USA, Czech Republic, 
      and recently in Argentina. M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis was associated with
      different dairy products and water for human consumption. Therefore, it is
      possible that these food sources may have a role for transmission. New
      investigations should emphasize the role of contaminated food and water in human 
      infection around the world and determine the possible zoonotic role of M. avium
      subsp. paratuberculosis.

TI  - Moderate dietary temperance effectively prevents relapse of Crohn disease: a
      prospective study of patients in remission.
PG  - 202-10
AB  - The authors examined the influence of diet (dietary fat intake and dietary
      temperance) on relapse of patients with Crohn disease. A 1-year prospective study
      of 76 patients with Crohn disease was conducted. The criterion for eligibility
      was a Crohn Disease Activity Index score of 150 or lower for at least 1 month.
      The primary end point was defined as the relapse-free interval from the baseline 
      until the first relapse. Fat intake was assessed using a validated diet history
      questionnaire. The degree of dietary temperance was assessed using a single-item 
      nominal scale. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the
      influence of diet. Crohn disease relapse was seen in 25 patients (33%), and 47
      patients (62%) remained in continuous remission. A decreased ratio of n-6
      polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) to n-3PUFA (odds ratio = .38; p = .005) was
      associated with a poor prognosis. Dietary temperance also was significantly
      associated with prognosis (p = .014). More moderate dietary temperance decreased 
      the risk of relapse (odds ratio = .22; p = .006). Effective prevention of relapse
      for Crohn disease patients might be achieved through moderate dietary temperance,
      particularly when the disease condition is unstable.

TI  - Does polymeric formula improve adherence to liquid diet therapy in children with 
      active Crohn's disease?
PG  - 767-70
AB  - BACKGROUND: Active Crohn's disease can be treated using liquid diet therapy
      (LDT), but non-adherence may limit success, necessitating corticosteroid therapy.
      Whole-protein polymeric formula (PF) seems to be much more palatable than amino
      acid-based elemental formula (EF) and thus may significantly improve adherence to
      LDT. AIM: To compare adherence to LDT using PF versus EF. METHODS: Success in
      completing a 6-week course of LDT, need for nasogastric tube administration of
      formula and use of LDT for relapses were compared between children presenting
      with active disease and treated with EF (n = 53) and children given PF (n = 45). 
      RESULTS: Remission rates were similar (EF 64%, 95% CI 51 to 77 vs PF 51%, 95% CI 
      37 to 66; p>0.15). 72% (95% CI 60 to 84) given EF completed the initial course of
      LDT compared with 58% (95% CI 44 to 72) given PF (p = 0.15). Of those failing to 
      complete the initial course, 13% on EF and 16% on PF gave up by choice
      (non-adherence), the remainder stopping due to treatment failure. Nasogastric
      administration was more frequent with EF (55%, 95% CI 42 to 68) compared to PF
      (31%, 95% CI 17 to 45) (p = 0.02). Among those treated successfully at first
      presentation, LDT was used for 28% of relapses in the EF group (95% CI 12 to 44) 
      and 39% in the PF group (95% CI 19 to 59) (p>0.2) over the next year. CONCLUSION:
      PF did not effect adherence to LDT but was associated with significantly reduced 
      need for nasogastric tube administration of formula.

TI  - Crohn's disease intestinal CD4+ T cells have impaired interleukin-10 production
      which is not restored by probiotic bacteria.
PG  - 592-601
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Crohn's disease (CD) has been associated with low mucosal interleukin 
      (IL)-10 production, but the mechanism behind this deficiency remains unclear. The
      aim of this study was to investigate IL-10 and interferon (IFN)-gamma production 
      in intestinal CD4+ T cells from CD patients and healthy volunteers (HV) and to
      examine how this was affected by bacterial products and the presence or absence
      of autologous dendritic cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We cultured intestinal CD4+ 
      T cells from CD patients (n=9) and HV (n=6) and differentiated dendritic cells
      from their peripheral monocytes. Intestinal T cells were stimulated with
      Lactobacillus strains or autologous intestinal bacteria in the presence or
      absence of dendritic cells. IL-10 and IFN-gamma were measured on day 4. RESULTS: 
      When there were autologous dendritic cells present, CD intestinal T cells
      produced high levels of IFN-gamma (mean 6.4 ng/ml+/-standard error of the mean
      1.1 ng/ml) but low levels of IL-10 (0.7 ng/ml+/-0.1 ng/ml). In contrast, HV
      intestinal T cells produced less IFN-gamma (3.9 ng/ml+/-0.8 ng/ml, p=0.06) and
      more IL-10 (4.6 ng/ml+/-0.9 ng/ml, p=0.0001) than CD intestinal T cells.
      Co-culture with Lactobacilli failed to revert this imbalance in CD, but tended to
      do so in HV. When there were no dendritic cells, CD intestinal T cells responded 
      to autologous bacteria with an increased IFN-gamma production (2.3+/-1.3 ng/ml)
      compared with HV intestinal T cells (0.3+/-0.2 ng/ml). CONCLUSIONS: Crohn's
      disease intestinal CD4+ T cells display a pro-inflammatory cytokine profile with 
      impaired production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10. Tolerogenic bacteria
      (Lactobacilli) failed to restore this regulatory defect.

AB  - In Crohn disease, a vigorous inflammatory cascade is caused by the overactivation
      of helper T-cells in the gastrointestinal system. The results of this
      inflammation manifest themselves as the symptoms of Crohn disease. This article
      describes the pathophysiology of Crohn disease as well as multiple pharmacologic 
      and nonpharmacologic interventions that may assist patients with Crohn disease in
      preventing exacerbations and maintaining longer remissions.

TI  - Pneumocystis jiroveci (carinii) pneumonia after infliximab therapy: a review of
      84 cases.
PG  - 1481-4
AB  - Anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha therapy, infliximab, has become an established
      effective therapy for Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. However,
      infliximab has been associated with various opportunistic pathogens such as
      tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, listeriosis, aspergillosis, and Pneumocystis
      jiroveci (carinii) pneumonia. We reviewed the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System 
      for cases of Pneumocystis associated with infliximab use from January 1998
      through December 2003. The database revealed 84 cases of PCP following infliximab
      therapy. Concomitant immunosuppressive medications included methotrexate,
      prednisone, azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, and cyclosporine. Mean time between
      infliximab infusion and onset of symptoms of pneumonia, when reported, was 21
      days (+/-18 days; n=40). Twenty-three of the 84 (27%) patients died. The use of
      infliximab is associated with PCP infection. Further, the mortality rate for
      Pneumocystis following the use of infliximab is significant. The potential for
      severe disease, mortality, and often subtle presentation of these infections
      warrant close follow-up and careful monitoring after therapy.

TI  - Impact of enteral supplements enriched with omega-3 fatty acids and/or omega-6
      fatty acids, arginine and ribonucleic acid compounds on leptin levels and
      nutritional status in active Crohn's disease treated with prednisolone.
PG  - 10-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) often develop malnutrition due to 
      disease activity. We aimed to assess the effect of two different enteral
      supplements of Impact(R) Powder (IP; Novartis, Switzerland) on leptin levels and 
      nutritional status in active CD patients during prednisolone treatment and
      tapering. METHODS: Thirty-one CD patients were randomized to IP Extra (group 1)
      or IP Standard (group 2). Leptin levels, nutritional, clinical and biochemical
      markers were studied at inclusion, after 5 and after 9 weeks of the study.
      RESULTS: Leptin levels, body mass index (BMI) and total cholesterol increased
      significantly within both groups at week 5 compared to inclusion. Leptin levels
      correlated with BMI in both groups at inclusion and in group 2 at week 9. In
      group 1, triglyceride levels remained unchanged, while levels in group 2
      increased significantly at week 5 compared to inclusion. Clinical and biochemical
      markers improved during the study compared to inclusion. CONCLUSIONS: Increased
      leptin levels during the study progress were transient, decreasing due to
      prednisolone withdrawal at the end of the study. Both formulas used as adjuvant
      therapy to prednisolone treatment were able to improve nutritional status in CD
      patients.

TI  - Crohn's disease in patients who fail infliximab therapy: what does the future
      hold?
PG  - S20-6
AB  - Patients who respond to infliximab enjoy many benefits, including improvement in 
      clinical symptoms, less disability, and a better quality of life. Unfortunately, 
      many patients are unresponsive to infliximab therapy. They may be completely
      refractory to infliximab therapy (ie, primary nonresponders), they may have shown
      an initial response to therapy that subsequently diminished, or they may be
      hypersensitive to the drug. For these patients, second-generation tumor necrosis 
      factor (TNF) inhibitors will soon be available; adalimumab and certolizumab pegol
      are the two agents most likely to gain Food and Drug Administration approval for 
      the treatment of Crohn's disease. This article looks at recent studies using
      these newer TNF inhibitors in patients in whom infliximab treatment has failed as
      well as in those who have never received infliximab.

AB  - Standard treatment for IBD with 5-ASA, steroids and immunosuppressants is rather 
      effective and currently optimized using combinations of drugs or application
      routes. Among the biologics only infliximab has reached the therapeutic arsenal
      for Crohn's disease--it is as well effective in some patients with ulcerative
      colitis. Early aggressive treatment thus far is not established. Hormones and
      growth factors may play a role. Probiotics have a place in the treatment in
      particular for ulcerative colitis.

TI  - [Changes in the epidemiology of inflammatory bowel diseases].
PG  - 223-8
AB  - Significant changes have been observed in the epidemiology of inflammatory bowel 
      diseases (IBD) in the last two decades. Traditionally, the incidence of IBD was
      higher in the developed, industrialized countries, in contrast, nowadays it
      became more prevalent in the previously low incidence areas. In particular, the
      incidence of ulcerative colitis (UC) is similar to that observed in North America
      and Western Europe, while the incidence of Crohn's disease (CD) in developing
      countries is still low, suggesting that the environmental factors may act faster 
      or differently in UC than in CD. In Europe, the North to South gradient
      disappeared, and also the West to East gradient is diminishing. Smoking and
      appendectomy may be considered as important environmental factors in both UC and 
      CD, however, with opposite effects. In addition, the use of oral contraceptives
      is associated to disease susceptibility in both diseases. The role of diet,
      perinatal events, stress and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the
      pathogenesis is still controversial.

TI  - Usefulness of an elemental diet in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 15-7
AB  - Crohn's disease is a chronic relapsing disease for which no complete cure is
      available. Although drug therapy with agents such as corticosteroids and
      azathiopurine is useful, the long-term side effects of these drugs are
      problematic. The advent of infliximab has recently brought a change in treatment,
      but the long-term side effects of this agent remain uncertain. In contrast,
      nutritional therapy produces no drug-induced side effects and is effective in
      inducing and maintaining remission. However, sufficient efficacy cannot be
      expected in patients in whom compliance with nutritional regimens gradually
      decreases owing to unpalatability. In these cases, combination therapy with
      agents such as immunosuppressors and infliximab may be useful.

TI  - The effect of marine oil-derived n-3 fatty acids on transepithelial calcium
      transport in Caco-2 cell models of healthy and inflamed intestines.
PG  - 281-8
AB  - Marine oil-derived n-3 fatty acids have been shown to stimulate intestinal Ca
      absorption in animal studies, but the effects of such fatty acids on Ca
      absorption in human subjects are relatively unknown. In particular, n-3 fatty
      acids may be of therapeutic value for some Crohn's disease patients who
      experience Ca malabsorption. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to
      investigate the effect of 20 : 5n-3 and 22 : 6n-3 on transepithelial Ca transport
      across monolayers of healthy Caco-2 cells as well as of TNF-alpha-treated Caco-2 
      cells (an in vitro model of Crohn's disease). Caco-2 cells were seeded onto
      permeable filter supports and allowed to differentiate into monolayers, which
      were treated with 80 microM-20 : 5n-3, 80 microM-22 : 6n-3, or 40 microM-20 :
      5n-3 + 40 microM-22 : 6n-3 for 6 or 8 d, with or without co-treatment with
      TNF-alpha (10 ng/ml) (n 11-15 monolayers per treatment). On day 16,
      transepithelial and transcellular transport of 45Ca and fluorescein transport (a 
      marker of paracellular diffusion) were measured. Treatment of healthy and
      inflamed Caco-2 cells with 20 : 5n-3, 22 : 6n-3 and both fatty acids combined for
      8 d significantly (P < 0.005-0.01) increased total transepithelial Ca transport
      compared with that in control, effects which were mediated by an enhanced rate of
      transcellular Ca transport. The effects of n-3 fatty acids on Ca absorption after
      6 d were less clear-cut. In conclusion, the present in vitro findings highlight
      the need to investigate the effect of marine oil-based n-3 fatty acids on Ca
      absorption in vivo in studies of healthy human subjects as well as of Crohn's
      disease patients.

PG  - CD000542
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease is controversial.
      Increasing research on the mechanisms by which nutritional therapy improves the
      clinical well being of patients with Crohn's disease has led to novel formula
      design and trials comparing two different forms of enteral nutrition. This
      meta-analysis aims to provide an update on the existing effectiveness data for
      both corticosteroids versus enteral nutrition and for one form of enteral
      nutrition versus another for inducing remission of active Crohn's disease.
      OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of exclusive enteral nutrition (EN) as 
      primary therapy to induce remission in Crohn's disease and to examine the
      importance of formula composition on effectiveness. SEARCH STRATEGY: Studies were
      selected using a computer-assisted search of the on-line bibliographic databases 
      MEDLINE (1966-2006) and EMBASE (1984-2006), as well as the Science Citation Index
      on Web of Science. Additional citations were sought by manual search of
      references of articles retrieved from the computerized search, abstracts
      submitted to major gastroenterologic meetings and published in the journals:
      American Journal of Gastroenterology, Gut, Gastroenterology, Journal of Pediatric
      Gastroenterology and Nutrition, and Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition, 
      and from the reviewers' personal files or contact with leaders in the field.
      SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials
      involving patients with active Crohn's disease defined by a clinical disease
      activity index were considered for review. Studies evaluating the administration 
      of one type of enteral nutrition to one group of patients and another type of
      enteral nutrition or conventional corticosteroids to the other group were
      selected for review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted
      independently by two authors and any discrepancies were resolved by rereading and
      discussion. For the dichotomous variable, achievement of remission, individual
      and pooled trial statistics were calculated as odds ratios (OR) with 95%
      confidence intervals (CI); both fixed and random effect models were used. The
      results for each analysis were tested for heterogeneity using the chi square
      statistic. The studies were separated into two groups: A. one form of enteral
      nutrition compared with another form of enteral nutrition and B. one form of
      enteral nutrition compared with corticosteroids. Subgroup analyses were conducted
      on the basis of clinical or disease criteria and formula composition. Sensitivity
      analyses were conducted on the basis of the inclusion of abstract publications,
      methodologic quality and by random or fixed effects models. MAIN RESULTS: In part
      A, of the 15 included eligible trials (one abstract) comparing different
      formulations of EN for the treatment of active CD, 11 compared one (or more)
      elemental formula to a non-elemental one, three compared enteral diets of similar
      protein composition but different fat composition, and one compared non-elemental
      diets differing only in glutamine enrichment. Meta-analysis of ten trials
      comprising 334 patients demonstrated no difference in the efficacy of elemental
      versus non-elemental formulas (OR 1.10; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.75). Subgroup analyses
      performed to evaluate the different types of elemental and non-elemental diets
      (elemental, semi-elemental and polymeric) showed no statistically significant
      differences. Further analysis of seven trials including 209 patients treated with
      EN formulas of differing fat content (low fat: < 20 g/1000 kCal versus high fat: 
      > 20 g/1000 kCal) demonstrated no statistically significant difference in
      efficacy (OR 1.13; 95% CI 0.63 to 2.01). Similarly, the effect of very low fat
      content (< 3 g/1000 kCal) or type of fat (long chain triglycerides) were
      investigated, but did not demonstrate a difference in efficacy in the treatment
      of active CD, although a non significant trend was demonstrated favoring very low
      fat and very low long chain triglyceride content. This result should be
      interpreted with caution due to statistically significant heterogeneity and small
      sample size. Sensitivity analyses had no significant effects on the results. The 
      role of specific fatty acids or disease characteristics on response to therapy
      could not be evaluated. In part B, eight trials (including two abstracts)
      comparing enteral nutrition to steroid therapy met the inclusion criteria for
      review. Meta-analysis of six trials that included 192 patients treated with
      enteral nutrition and 160 treated with steroids yielded a pooled OR of 0.33
      favouring steroid therapy (95% CI 0.21 to 0.53). A sensitivity analysis including
      the abstracts resulted in an increase in the number of participants to 212 in the
      enteral nutrition group and 179 in the steroid group but the meta-analysis
      yielded a similar result (OR 0.36; 95% CI 0.23 to 0.56). There were inadequate
      data from full publications to perform further subgroup analyses by age, disease 
      duration and disease location. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroid therapy is
      more effective than enteral nutrition for inducing remission of active Crohn's
      disease as was found in previous systematic reviews. Protein composition does not
      influence the effectiveness of EN in the treatment of active CD. A non
      significant trend favouring very low fat and/or very low long chain triglyceride 
      content exists but larger trials are required to explore the significance of this
      finding.

TI  - A case-control study of drinking water and dairy products in Crohn's
      Disease--further investigation of the possible role of Mycobacterium avium
      paratuberculosis.
PG  - 776-83
AB  - Similarities between Johne's disease in ruminants and Crohn's disease in humans
      have led to speculation that Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis (MAP) might be 
      a causative agent in Crohn's disease. However, evidence remains inconsistent. In 
      this case-control study (1999-2004), the authors assessed the possible role of
      drinking water and dairy products potentially contaminated with MAP in the
      etiology of Crohn's disease. A total of 218 patients with Crohn's disease
      recruited from nine hospitals in England and 812 controls recruited from the
      community completed a short questionnaire for evaluation of proxy measures of
      potential exposure to MAP. Logistic regression showed no significant association 
      with measures of potential contamination of water sources with MAP, water intake,
      or water treatment. Multivariate analysis showed that consumption of pasteurized 
      milk (per kg/month: odds ratio (OR) = 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.69,
      0.97) was associated with a reduced risk of Crohn's disease. Meat intake (per
      kg/month: OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.17, 1.67) was associated with a significantly
      increased risk of Crohn's disease, whereas fruit consumption (per kg/month: OR = 
      0.78, 95% CI: 0.67, 0.92) was associated with reduced risk. This study does not
      support a role for water or dairy products potentially contaminated with MAP in
      the etiology of Crohn's disease. The observed association with meat and the
      negative association with pasteurized milk need further study.

TI  - Impact of long-term enteral nutrition on clinical and endoscopic recurrence after
      resection for Crohn's disease: A prospective, non-randomized, parallel,
      controlled study.
PG  - 67-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: The impact of enteral nutrition on post-operative recurrence has not 
      been properly examined. AIM: To investigate the impact of enteral nutrition using
      an elemental diet on clinical and endoscopic recurrence after resection for
      Crohn's disease. METHODS: Forty consecutive patients who underwent resection for 
      ileal or ileocolonic Crohn's disease were studied. After operation, 20 patients
      continuously received enteral nutritional therapy (EN group), and 20 had neither 
      nutritional therapy nor food restriction (non-EN group). In the EN group, enteral
      formula (Elental) was infused through a nasogastric tube in the night-time, and
      low fat foods were taken in the daytime. All patients were followed up regularly 
      for 1 year after operation. Ileocolonoscopy was performed at 6 and 12 months
      after operation. RESULTS: One patient (5%) in the EN group and seven (35%) in the
      non-EN group developed clinical recurrence during 1-year follow-up (P = 0.048).
      Six months after operation, five patients (25%) in the EN group and eight (40%)
      in the non-EN group developed endoscopic recurrence (P = 0.50). Twelve months
      after operation, endoscopic recurrence was observed in six patients (30%) in the 
      EN group and 14 (70%) in the non-EN group (P = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: Our long-term
      enteral nutritional therapy significantly reduced clinical and endoscopic
      recurrence after resection for Crohn's disease.

TI  - Failure of Synbiotic 2000 to prevent postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 385-9
AB  - Complications of Crohn's disease (CD) lead to surgery in about 70-90% of
      patients. The majority of patients suffer from relapse of the disease. Colonic
      bacteria are essential to the development of CD. Therefore, a rationale exists in
      trying to prevent relapse by manipulation of gut microflora. This is feasible by 
      treatment with probiotics or antibiotics. Synbiotic 2000 is a cocktail containing
      4 probiotic species and 4 prebiotics. It is rational to pursue that it could be
      effective in preventing postoperative disease. We sought to check weather
      treatment with Synbiotic 2000 could prevent postoperative recurrence in patients 
      with CD. This was a prospective multicenter, randomized study. Patients were
      randomized to active treatment or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. Follow-up consisted of 
      endoscopic, clinical, and laboratory parameters. Thirty patients were enrolled.
      No differences were found between the 2 treatment groups regarding gender, age at
      diagnosis, age at surgery, weight, smoking status, type of disease, length of the
      resected segment, or medical treatment prior to surgery. No difference in either 
      endoscopic or clinical relapse rate was found between patients treated with once 
      daily dose of Synbiotic 2000 or placebo. In our small study, Synbiotic 2000 had
      no effect on postoperative recurrence of patients with CD. Larger studies in
      patients with the inflammatory type of CD undergoing surgery, using higher doses 
      of probiotics cocktail might prove effective.

TI  - Multicenter randomized-controlled clinical trial of probiotics (Lactobacillus
      johnsonii, LA1) on early endoscopic recurrence of Crohn's disease after
      lleo-caecal resection.
PG  - 135-42
AB  - BACKGROUND: Seventy percent of Crohn's disease (CD) patients exhibit anastomotic 
      recurrence within 1 year after ileo-caecal surgery. Recent clinical trials
      suggest the beneficial use of probiotics in the control of intestinal
      inflammation in pouchitis and ulcerative colitis. This study is a multicenter
      clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of an oral administration of the probiotic
      LAl on early post-operative endoscopic recurrence of CD. METHODS: Seventy
      patients with CD were enrolled prior to elective ileo-caecal resection and
      randomly assigned after surgery to daily treatment with either Lactobacillus
      johnsonii, LA1, Nestle (1010 colony-forming units, CFU) (group A, n = 34) or
      placebo (group B, n = 36) for 12 weeks. The primary objective was to assess the
      effect of LAl on the endoscopic recurrence rate at 12 weeks. Stratification was
      performed according to smoking status at randomization. RESULTS: Seven and 14
      patients were excluded in the LA1 and placebo groups, respectively. In
      intention-to-treat analysis, the mean endoscopic score was not significantly
      different between the two treatment groups at 3 months (LA1 versus placebo: 1.50 
      +/- 1.32 versus 1.22+/-1.37, treatment effect: P = 0.48, smoke effect: P = 0.72).
      The percentage of patients with severe recurrence (i3 + i4) was 21% and 15% in
      the LAl and placebo groups, respectively (P = 0.33). Using a per-protocol (PP)
      analysis, the mean endoscopic score was not significantly different between the
      two treatment groups (LAl versus placebo groups: 1.44 +/-1.31 versus 1.05 +/-
      1.21, P = 0.32). The percentage of patients with severe recurrence (i3 + i4) was 
      19% and 9% in the LAl and placebo groups, respectively (P = 0.054). Clinical
      relapse rate (CDAI [CD activity index] > 150, with an increase of CDAI > 70
      points or greater from baseline) in the LAl and placebo groups was 15% (4/27) and
      13.5% (3/22), respectively (PP analysis: chi-square test, P = 0.91 and log-rank
      test: P = 0.79). CONCLUSION: Oral administration of the probiotic LA1 in patients
      with CD failed to prevent early endoscopic recurrence at 12 weeks after
      ileo-caecal resection.

TI  - Patchy distribution of mucosal lesions in ileal Crohn's disease is not linked to 
      differences in the dominant mucosa-associated bacteria: a study using
      fluorescence in situ hybridization and temporal temperature gradient gel
      electrophoresis.
PG  - 684-92
AB  - BACKGROUND: The mucosa-associated bacteria (MAB) are suspected of being involved 
      in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. We analyzed and compared the MAB in
      noninflamed and inflamed ileal mucosa of Crohn's disease patients (n = 22).
      METHODS: Tissue samples from the inflamed ileal mucosa and from the adjacent
      noninflamed ileal mucosa were taken from surgical resection specimens. The MAB
      were investigated using fluorescence in situ hybridization with 7 group-specific 
      probes and temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE). RESULTS:
      Samples from both noninflamed and inflamed mucosa were obtained from 15 patients.
      The distribution of the bacterial populations was not different between
      noninflamed and inflamed mucosa. The Bacteroidetes phylum was dominant and
      accounted for 29% of MAB (0%-74%) in noninflamed tissues and 32% (0%-70%) in
      inflamed areas. The gamma Proteobacteria represented 12% (0%-70%) of MAB both in 
      noninflamed and inflamed areas. The Clostridium coccoides group (Firmicutes
      phylum) represented 15% of MAB in noninflamed tissues versus 7% in inflamed
      areas. For most of the patients the similarity index between TTGE paired profiles
      was very high. CONCLUSION: The dominant MAB do not differ between noninflamed and
      inflamed ileal mucosa in Crohn's disease. This argues against a localized
      dysbiosis to explain the patchy distribution of mucosal lesions.

TI  - Contribution of genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of Crohn's 
      disease in a large family with multiple cases.
PG  - 580-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: A large family of Moroccan immigrants was investigated. In this
      family the father developed Crohn's disease (CD) after moving from Morocco to
      Belgium and successively 4 of his 8 children subsequently developed CD. There was
      no previous history of familial CD. METHODS: The family was interviewed at their 
      home and an elaborated questionnaire was completed. The food and sanitation
      characteristics of the family were investigated. Moreover, serological markers
      were tested in all family members, including ASCA, ASCAg, ALCA, ACCA, Omp, and
      ANCA, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and indirect immunofluorescence.
      Genetic variants in CARD15, TLR4, NOD1, CARD8, and DLG5 associated with CD were
      tested as well. The complete medical history of all patients was reviewed.
      RESULTS: There were no known genetic variants associated with CD in this family. 
      None of the serological antibodies could discriminate between patients and
      unaffected family members, although the antibody titers were higher in diseased
      family members as compared with the healthy family members. CONCLUSION: The
      occurrence of 5 new cases of CD within 1 Moroccan family after immigration to
      Belgium cannot be explained by the known genetic susceptibility factors, and thus
      suggests a major environmental factor probably not related to sanitation in
      childhood.

LID - 0416 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Crohn's disease is a long-term chronic condition of the
      gastrointestinal tract. It is characterised by transmural, granulomatous
      inflammation that occurs in a discontinuous pattern, with a tendency to form
      fistulae. The cause is unknown but may depend on interactions between genetic
      predisposition, environmental triggers, and mucosal immunity. METHODS AND
      OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following
      clinical questions: What are the effects of medical treatments in adults to
      induce remission in Crohn's disease? What are the effects of lifestyle
      interventions in adults with Crohn's disease to maintain remission? What are the 
      effects of surgical interventions in adults with small-bowel Crohn's disease to
      induce remission? What are the effects of surgical interventions in adults with
      colonic Crohn's disease to induce remission? What are the effects of medical
      interventions to maintain remission in adults with Crohn's disease; and to
      maintain remission following surgery? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane 
      Library and other important databases up to March 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews
      are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date
      version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations
      such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and
      Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 60 systematic
      reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria.
      CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the
      effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: aminosalicylates,
      antibiotics, azathioprine/mercaptopurine, ciclosporin, corticosteroids (oral),
      enteral nutrition, fish oil, infliximab, methotrexate, probiotics, resection,
      segmental colectomy, smoking cessation, and strictureplasty.

TI  - Transgenic probiotica as drug delivery systems: the golden bullet?
PG  - 1-3
AB  - Functional human proteins are constitutively produced in genetically modified
      bacteria that survive on human mucosal surfaces, to the benefit of the host. The 
      successful Phase I clinical trial with IL-10-producing Lactococcus lactis for
      Crohn's disease has opened new avenues for the use of transgenic bacteria as
      delivery vehicles. The major advantage of this novel strategy is the avoidance of
      systemic side effects associated with conventional therapies. This methodology
      opens up an alternative method for local delivery of therapeutic proteins to
      various mucosal tissues.

TI  - Differences in yeast intolerance between patients with Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 83-8
AB  - PURPOSE: Alimentary factors, especially those modifying the intestinal flora, may
      influence the course of inflammatory bowel disease. It is known that T and B
      cells of patients with Crohn's disease can be stimulated with the yeast antigen, 
      mannan. We evaluated the impact of eating habits with special respect to food
      containing yeast on the course of inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS:
      Questionnaires were sent to 180 German-speaking patients of the Inflammatory
      Bowel Disease Outpatient Clinic at the University Hospital Bern, Switzerland. The
      following information was obtained by the questionnaires: (1) course of disease, 
      (2) eating habits, (3) environmental data, and (4) inflammatory bowel disease
      questionnaire. The survey was anonymous. RESULTS: A total of 145 patients (80.5
      percent 95 with Crohn's disease, and 50 with ulcerative colitis) responded. Food 
      items containing yeast were better tolerated by patients with ulcerative colitis 
      than by patients with Crohn's disease. A significant difference between the two
      groups was observed concerning food containing raw yeast (dough, P = 0.04; and
      pastry, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Food items containing raw yeast led to more
      frequent problems for patients with Crohn's disease than for patients with
      ulcerative colitis. This observation supports our previous data, which showed the
      stimulatory effect of the yeast antigen, mannan, on B and T cells of patients
      with Crohn's disease but not of controls.

TI  - The Vitamin D analogue TX 527 blocks NF-kappaB activation in peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells of patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 51-60
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) is an inflammatory disease characterized by the activation
      of the immune system in the gut. Since tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) plays an
      important role in the initiation and perpetuation of intestinal inflammation in
      CD, we investigated whether TX 527 [19-nor-14,20-bisepi-23-yne-1,25(OH)(2)D(3)], 
      a Vitamin D analogue, could affect peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
      proliferation and exert an immunosuppressive effect on TNF-alpha production in CD
      patients, and whether this immunosuppressive action could be mediated by
      NF-kappaB down-regulation. TX 527 significantly decreased cell proliferation and 
      TNF-alpha levels. On activation, NF-kappaB, rapidly released from its
      cytoplasmatic inhibitor (IKB-alpha), transmigrates into the nucleus and binds to 
      DNA response elements in gene promoter regions. The activation of NF-kappaB,
      stimulated by TNF-alpha, and its nuclear translocation together with the
      degradation of IKB-alpha were blocked by TX 527. At the same time, NF-kappaB
      protein levels present in cytoplasmic extracts decreased in the presence of
      TNF-alpha and increased when PBMC were incubated with TX 527. The results of our 
      studies indicate that TX 527 inhibits TNF-alpha mediated effects on PBMC and the 
      activation of NF-kappaB and that its action is mediated by Vitamin D receptor
      (VDR), which is activated when the cells are stimulated with TX 527.
