TI  - Effects of new fish oil derivative on fatty acid phospholipid-membrane pattern in
      a group of Crohn's disease patients.
PG  - 2589-94
AB  - Fish oil has been recently proposed as a possible effective treatment in
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, a lot of annoying side effects (ie,
      belching, halitosis, diarrhea, etc) affect patient compliance. We carried out a
      study of patient tolerance in a group of Crohn's disease (CD) patients with a new
      fish oil derivative consisting of 500-mg capsules of
      eicosapentaenoic-docosahexaenoic (EPA 40%-DHA 20%), a free fatty acid mixture
      (Purepa), and we also evaluated its incorporation into phospholipids, both in
      plasma and in red cell membranes. Five groups of 10 CD patients in remission
      received nine Purepa capsules daily in four different preparations (A: uncoated, 
      B: coated, pH 5.5; C: coated, pH 5.5, 60 min time release; D: coated, pH 6.9) and
      12 x 1-g capsules daily of a triglyceride preparation (Max-EPA, EPA 18%-DHA 10%),
      respectively. We coated three of the four Purepa preparations in order to delay
      the release of contents in an attempt to minimize the side effects. After six
      weeks of treatment, the group taking Purepa capsules, coated, pH 5.5, 60 min time
      release (group C) showed the best incorporation of EPA and DHA in red blood cell 
      phospholipid membranes (EPA from 0.2 to 4.4%, DHA from 3.7 to 6.3%), and no side 
      effects were registered, whereas in all other groups side effects were
      experienced in 50% or more of subjects. This new preparation will make it
      possible to treat patients for long periods.

TI  - [Zinc deficiency syndrome during TPN].
PG  - 209-12
AB  - The zinc deficiency syndrome, also called enteropathic acrodermatitis, has been
      mostly observed in those pathologies of the gastroenteric system characterized by
      grave food shortages during long term TPN in association with inflammatory
      intestinal pathologies. The authors believe this to be caused of such syndrome,
      that in the case in question is demonstrated before the normal period described
      in the literature to be caused by both increased request related to TPN and a
      greater loss or less absorption due to intestinal phlogosis. The case described
      has been noted in a general surgery division in a young patient suffering from
      Crohn's disease for many years in treatment with medical therapy and now
      complicated by perianal abscess following burrowing on the outside subjected and 
      therefore in treatment with artificial parenteral nutrition pre and post
      operative. Such pathology to be due when to begin a symptomatology characterized 
      by consciousness alteration, diarrhoea, vesicular squamous cutaneous lesions
      around orifices, often infected by bacteria and mycosis in patients in treatment 
      nutritional artificial continued for digestive apparatus diseases. The knowledge 
      of this syndrome and its diagnosis lead, through integrative therapy, to its
      resolution in a short time. The authors describe the course of a clinical case
      occurred to then and ended with the patient's recovery. They underline the risks 
      of ignoring this pathology.

TI  - Mechanisms of decreased food intake during weight loss in adult Crohn's disease
      patients without obvious malabsorption.
PG  - 775-81
AB  - Because weight loss is common in colonic Crohn's disease and is poorly correlated
      with disease activity, we analyzed food intake in 63 patients without
      malabsorption, 30 patients with weight loss (9.2 +/- 4.2 kg), and 33 patients
      without weight loss. Energy and protein intakes were lower in patients with
      weight loss than in those with stable weight (P < 0.01). In the former group,
      food restrictions were more numerous (P < 0.01) and visual analog scales showed
      less hunger, decreased appetite, and fewer sensations of pleasure related to
      eating, as compared with the other group (P < 0.01). Food intake reduction was
      also related to depressive mood and medical advice. However, there was no
      difference between groups in fecal energy wasting and resting energy expenditure.
      Weight loss in Crohn's disease may be due to a decrease in food intake rather
      than to an increase in energy cost of the disease. Thus, focus of attention on
      the diet is crucial to prevent malnutrition.

TI  - Exclusive whole protein enteral diet versus prednisolone in the treatment of
      acute Crohn's disease in children.
PG  - 175-80
AB  - Nineteen children with either newly diagnosed or relapsed Crohn's disease were
      enrolled in a randomized study in which the efficacy of enteral feeding with a
      whole protein-based formula was compared to high-dose corticosteroids in
      achieving clinical remission and normalization of laboratory measurements. Ten
      children were treated by enteral feeding (Nutrison Standard, Nutricia), and nine 
      received corticosteroids. Both treatment regimens lasted 11 weeks. The activity
      of Crohn's disease was similar in both groups before the commencement of the
      treatment. Clinical symptoms and signs, as judged by the pediatric Crohn's
      disease activity index and measurements relating to inflammatory activity
      (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, blood leukocyte and platelet
      count, and serum immunoglobulins G and A) and to nutritional status
      (concentrations of serum albumin, prealbumin, hemoglobin) improved rapidly and
      significantly with as little as 2 weeks' treatment in both treatment groups. In
      both groups, there was one relapse within 8 weeks after discontinuation of
      treatment, and one patient in both groups was operated on during the treatment
      period. During the routine follow-up after the trial (0.3-2.5 years; mean, 1.3
      years) five of the corticosteroid group experienced a clinical relapse, whereas
      only one from the enteral feeding group relapsed. No side effects of enteral
      feeding were seen. Enteral feeding with a whole protein-based formula proved to
      be as effective as high-dose corticosteroid in the treatment of the acute phase
      of Crohn's disease and may prove to be the treatment of choice in pediatric
      patients with acute Crohn's disease.

      relation to intestinal resection.
PG  - 351-4
AB  - The morphologic and cytoproliferative patterns of the duodenal mucosa of two
      adult patients, one of whom had a short bowel, were evaluated after more than 2
      months of postoperative total parenteral nutrition and 2 and 12 months after the 
      resumption of oral alimentation. Morphometric analysis was performed on routinely
      processed duodenal biopsies. Cell proliferation was evaluated by means of in
      vitro bromodeoxyuridine uptake. The results were compared with those obtained in 
      five healthy controls. After parenteral nutrition, patients showed significantly 
      lower villus height and crypt depth than those of controls and a normal
      bromodeoxyuridine labeling index. After 2 months of refeeding, villus and crypt
      returned to normal, and the labeling index was increased. After 12 months of oral
      refeeding, labeling index, villus height, and crypt depth were similar to those
      of controls. The patient with the short bowel showed a number of cells per unit
      length of villus and crypt significantly greater than those of the controls and
      of the patient who underwent shorter intestinal resection. In human duodenal
      mucosa, (1) hypoplasia develops after long-term total parenteral nutrition; (2)
      mucosal recovery occurs through an increased cell proliferation after oral
      refeeding; and (3) extensive small bowel resection determines the development of 
      relative hyperplasia.

PG  - 1941-6
AB  - Intestinal release of inflammatory mediators and permeation of macromolecules
      were studied in patients suffering from Crohn's disease, celiac disease and food 
      intolerance with the use of a system for segmental intestinal perfusion. Drug
      absorption and ion and bicarbonate transport were also studied in healthy
      subjects. Patients with Crohn's disease of the distal ileum revealed an increased
      release of inflammatory agents into the lumen of the proximal jejunum. Luminal
      provocation with different antigens in cases of celiac disease and food
      intolerance not only activated cells in the intestinal mucosa but also increased 
      the leakage from plasma and lymph. Studies of drug absorption elucidated the
      kinetics of drug transport from intestine to plasma, and basal neurologic effects
      on ion and bicarbonate transport were determined.

      Relationship with steatorrhea.
PG  - 993-8
AB  - In order to study the fat-soluble vitamin concentration of patients with chronic 
      alcohol-induced pancreatitis (CAIP) we measured vitamins A and E, total lipids,
      and retinol-binding protein (RBP) in the plasma of 44 patients with CAIP and 83
      controls (44 healthy controls; 39 Crohn's disease patients). Mean plasma vitamin 
      E and vitamin E/total lipid ratio were significantly lower in CAIP when compared 
      with either control or Crohn's disease groups. A low vitamin E/total lipid ratio 
      was found in 75% of CAIP patients (91% with steatorrhea) and a ratio less than
      1.0 was virtually 100% predictive of steatorrhea. The mean plasma vitamin A level
      for the CAIP group was significantly lower (overall 16%, 38% with steatorrhea)
      than in controls. Patients with CAIP show subnormal plasma levels vitamin E more 
      often as compared to vitamin A. Further, the plasma vitamin E/total lipids ratio 
      may be a sensitive and practical means in the detection and follow-up of
      steatorrhea in these patients.

TI  - [Etiology of Crohn disease. Current data].
PG  - 558-60
AB  - Both genetic and environmental factors appear to play an aetiologic role in
      Crohn's disease. The hypothesis of genetic susceptibility is based on the
      frequency of familial forms (6-33%) and higher relative risk in first degree
      relatives (x10 to x21). Three genetic segregation analyses have defined a genetic
      model favouring autosomal recessive transmission and incomplete penetration. The 
      frequency of the deleterious allele would be 0.01 in the general population.
      One-third of all patients would be homozygous. To date, no genetic marker has
      been found for Crohn's disease although in one study, molecular biology
      techniques revealed a significant association between the HLA-DR1, DQW5
      genotypes, and the association DR1/DQW5, and Crohn's disease. There are also many
      arguments in favour of an environmental cause, including: increased incidence
      since the Second World War, a north-south incidence gradient (established in the 
      US and probable in Europe), predominance in urban areas. In addition, 21 conjugal
      forms were recently reported in the US, including 14 which appeared after
      marriage. We have also observed 10 conjugal forms in a limited area in northern
      France and in Belgium. Smoking has also been shown to have a detrimental effect, 
      perhaps via modifications in the microcirculation of the intestinal wall. Despite
      contradictory results, oestrogen-progesterone treatment does not appear to
      increase the risk of Crohn's disease and there is no convincing evidence that any
      particular food could be incriminated. In contradiction with a widely believed
      myth, there is no evidence showing that psychiatric factors have an effect on
      appearance or aggravation of the disease. Perinatal infection has however been
      recently shown to affect incidence and subjects born during periods of flu
      epidemics have a higher relative risk. Still other studies have emphasized the
      dual role of genetic/environmental factors. Based on current knowledge, the
      sequence leading to the appearance of Crohn's disease would include one or more
      perinatal event(s) such as viral infection acting on a genetically susceptible
      subject and leading to modified immune response in a vulnerable system (perinatal
      period). Later in life an aggression (environment) would lead to inappropriate
      immune response. Current research is directed towards identifying infectious
      agents capable of triggering the disease and on markers of genetic
      susceptibility.

TI  - Enteral nutrition as primary therapy in Crohn's disease.
PG  - S55-9
AB  - The developments in enteral feeding for Crohn's disease in the past decade are
      critically reviewed. The advent of amino acid based chemically defined elemental 
      diets signalled the end of 'total bowel rest' in the management of these
      patients. Subsequently, controlled clinical trials showed that elemental diets
      were as effective as corticosteroids in inducing clinical remission in patients
      with acute exacerbations of Crohn's disease. The later use of peptide based
      elemental diets, in Crohn's disease produced somewhat conflicting results. The
      initial uncontrolled studies suggest that polymeric whole protein diets might
      also be effective in the management of acute exacerbations of the disease,
      casting in turn doubts concerning the role of dietary antigens in the
      pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Results of controlled studies comparing the use 
      of elemental and polymeric diets as primary therapy in Crohn's disease have,
      however, also produced conflicting results. The results of one recent controlled 
      trial in which the use of polymeric diet was compared with that of
      corticosteroids does, however, suggest that these diets may have a primary
      therapeutic effect in Crohn's disease. An analysis of the composition of some of 
      the enteral diets used in different trials suggest that the effectiveness of
      enteral diets in treating active Crohn's disease might relate more to their fat
      than nitrogen composition. A hypothesis is proposed that the effectiveness of
      enteral nutrition in the primary therapy of acute exacerbations of Crohn's
      disease occurs because the successful diets used contain insufficient precursors 
      for arachidonate derived eicosanoid synthesis.

      the ileum caused by dietary fats and comparison with cytopathology in Crohn
      disease].
PG  - 727-34
AB  - Experimental investigations have shown alterations of the ileal mucosal surface
      after specific fat diets resembling early changes in Crohn's disease. An animal
      experiment in pigs has been conducted. After creation of an anisoperistaltic
      segment these were fed either a specific fat diet containing chemically
      processed, partially hydrogenated fats or a low fat control diet over a period of
      3 months. Defined areas of the ileal lamina propria were examined by transmission
      electron microscopy with the underlying question to what extent ultrastructural
      alterations could be compared to Crohn's disease. In comparison to the control
      group these areas were characterized by a dense infiltration of "inflammatory"
      cells like lymphocytes, histiocytes, macrophages and plasma cells indicating a
      hyperplasia and activation of lympho-plasmocytotic cells. Additionally, a focal
      prominent infiltration of mast cells with degranulation was observed as well as a
      dilatation of axons with depletion of axonal organelles in half of the animals
      after fat-feeding. Compared to patients with Crohn's disease the results show
      obvious similarities. It is concluded, that chemically processed fats could cause
      direct stimulation of immunologically-specific and non-specific cells in the
      lamina propria mucosae or directly injure the intestinal mucosa with secondary
      infiltration of inflammatory cells into the lamina propria.

AB  - The present study includes 40 patients with Crohn's disease who underwent an
      internal and psychodiagnostic examination over a period of 5 to 8 weeks. On the
      average, there were only minor psychic symptoms were recorded in the
      psychodiagnostic instruments. The fewest symptoms were seen in the
      recurrence-free interval, a moderate number at the beginning of intermittent
      inpatient treatment and the largest number of symptoms in patients transferred to
      a psychosomatic department. While decreasing significantly from high levels under
      internal intensive care and at the beginning of inpatient depth-analysis-based
      psychotherapy, symptoms of depression and anxiety dropped only slightly from
      initially low levels in outpatients. In addition, there were first changes in the
      patients personality profile during psychotherapy. The findings are discussed
      under diagnostic and therapeutic aspects.

PG  - 1131-4
AB  - Elemental diet is as effective in producing remission of Crohn's disease (CD) as 
      is corticosteroid treatment, but most patients relapse soon after resumption of a
      normal diet. We have investigated the efficacies of dietary modification and oral
      corticosteroids in maintaining remission achieved with elemental diet. In a
      multicentre trial, 136 patients with active CD were started on elemental diet and
      other treatment was withdrawn. 43 (31%) declined to continue elemental diet for
      14 days, but 78 (84%) of the remaining 93 achieved remission and were randomly
      assigned corticosteroids (38) or diet (40). Corticosteroid treatment started at
      40 mg prednisolone daily, which was tapered and stopped after 12 weeks; that
      group received dietary advice on healthy eating. The diet group received
      "tapered" placebo and were instructed to introduce one new food daily, excluding 
      any that precipitated symptoms. Assessment of progress for up to 2 years was made
      by physicians unaware of group assignment. Intention-to-treat analysis showed
      median lengths of remission of 3.8 (interquartile range 5.0) months in the
      corticosteroid group and 7.5 (15.3) months on diet, and relapse rates at 2 years,
      adjusted for withdrawals, of 79% and 62%, respectively (p = 0.048). Clinical
      improvement in the diet group was associated with significant changes in plasma
      albumin and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin concentrations and erythrocyte sedimentation
      rate. Food intolerances discovered were predominantly to cereals, dairy products,
      and yeast. Diet provides a further therapeutic strategy in active Crohn's
      disease.

PG  - 2882-8
AB  - The long term efficacy of low residue diet (LRD) for the maintenance of remission
      in patients with Crohn's disease was studied. The patients consisted of 60 with
      quiescent Crohn's disease who were given LRD (Clinimeal or Ensure Liquid) for
      maintenance therapy for more than one year (average 2.4 years) after discharge
      from our institute. On the basis of the quantity of LRD given per day, the
      patients were classified into three groups: A; O to 799 kcal a day, B; 800 to
      1599 kcal a day and C; more than 1600 kcal a day. The remission rate and the
      avoidance rate of admission were calculated and compared among three groups. The 
      remission rate in group C was significantly higher than those in groups A and B. 
      The avoidance rates of admission in groups B and C were significantly higher than
      that in group A. These results suggest that drinking of LRD at home is useful for
      the maintenance of remission in patients with Crohn's disease and that the effect
      of LRD depends on the quantity of LRD given per day.

TI  - Reduced metabolic efficiency in patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 2001-9
AB  - Malnutrition is frequently seen in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and 
      parenteral or enteral nutrition is considered essential in this patient group.
      However, many patients with Crohn's disease have difficulties in gaining weight
      in response to overfeeding, suggesting reduced energy retention. Substrate
      utilization and nutrient balances as well as changes in body composition were
      followed in 10 patients with Crohn's disease immediately in the course of
      remission on low-dose steroid treatment, during an eight-day period of continuous
      enteral nutrition at constant (protocol 1:1.5-fold basal energy expenditure) and 
      increasing (protocol 2:0.5- to 2.0-fold basal energy expenditure) nutrient
      supply. Energy, substrate, and nitrogen balances all became positive in response 
      to overfeeding. However, fat was predominantly oxidized at an infusion rate of
      1.2 g/kg body wt/day, whereas carbohydrates and proteins were effectively stored.
      A positive energy balance was reached at an energy infusion rate exceeding 31
      kcal/kg body wt/day and corresponding substrate supplies of 1.6, 1.7, and 1.1
      g/kg body wt/day for carbohydrates, fat, and protein, respectively. Nitrogen
      balance normalized at a supply of 0.14 g/kg body wt/day, which also reduced
      myofibrillar protein breakdown. Considering the relative contributions made by
      these nutrients in the diets, an accumulation of carbohydrates and protein but a 
      depletion in fat became evident from nutrient balances. In fact, body weight
      increased by 0.12 kg/day, which was explained by an increased extracellular
      (+0.18 kg/day) and body cell mass (+0.04 kg/day) at reduced fat mass (-0.10
      kg/day). Concomitantly, plasma T3 and insulin secretion both increased, whereas
      sympathetic nervous system activity decreased with overfeeding. This is contrary 
      to data observed in healthy subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Initial response and subsequent course of Crohn's disease treated with elemental 
      diet or prednisolone.
PG  - 1198-202
AB  - Elemental diet is as effective as corticosteroids in the treatment of previously 
      untreated Crohn's disease. It is unclear whether a poor nutritional state is a
      prerequisite for efficacy of elemental diet, whether previously treated patients 
      respond as well, or how duration of remission using elemental diet compares with 
      corticosteroid induced remission. Forty two patients with active Crohn's disease 
      were stratified for nutritional state and randomised to receive Vivonex TEN 2.1
      l/day for four weeks, or 0.75 mg prednisolone/kg/day for two weeks and subsequent
      reducing doses. Nine of 22 (41%) patients assigned to nutritional treatment were 
      intolerant of the diet. Thirty patients completed four weeks treatment. Disease
      activity decreased on elemental diet from mean (SEM) 4.8 (0.9) to 1.7 (0.6), p < 
      0.05, and on prednisolone from 5.3 (0.5) to 1.9 (0.6), p < 0.05. For each
      treatment, nourished and malnourished patients responded similarly. Patients with
      longstanding disease responded as well as newly diagnosed patients. The
      probability of maintaining remission at six months was 0.67 after prednisolone,
      0.28 after elemental diet, and at one year was 0.35 after prednisolone and 0.09
      after elemental diet, p < 0.05. When tolerated, elemental diet is as effective in
      the short term as prednisolone in newly and previously diagnosed Crohn's disease,
      and its benefit is independent of nutritional state. The subsequent relapse rate 
      after elemental diet induced remission, however, is greater than after treatment 
      with prednisolone.

TI  - Multiple vitamin status in Crohn's disease. Correlation with disease activity.
PG  - 1614-8
AB  - We measured serum, blood, or red cell concentrations of various vitamins in 24
      patients with Crohn's disease who had been free from any nutritional treatment,
      and compared them with those in 24 healthy controls. Twelve of the patients were 
      affected in the small bowel only, two in the large bowel only, and the remaining 
      10 in both the small and large bowel. The fat-soluble vitamins A and E were
      significantly decreased in patients with Crohn's disease compared to controls.
      Among the water-soluble vitamins, vitamins B1, B2 and B6 and folic acid were more
      depleted in patients with Crohn's disease than in the controls, whereas vitamins 
      B12 and C, nicotinic acid, and biotin were not different between the two groups, 
      and pantothenic acid was increased in patients with Crohn's disease. In addition,
      vitamin B2 and nicotinic acid showed a negative correlation with the Crohn's
      disease activity index. These findings suggest that there is a variety of vitamin
      deficiencies in Crohn's disease prior to treatment and also that concentrations
      of some vitamins, such as vitamin B2 and nicotinic acid, may reflect the severity
      of the disease.

TI  - Gastrointestinal and nutritional aspects of eating disorders.
PG  - 466-74
AB  - Anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) are potentially fatal eating
      disorders which primarily affect adolescent females. Differentiating eating
      disorders from primary gastrointestinal (GI) disease may be difficult. GI
      disorders are common in eating disorder patients, symptomatic complaints being
      seen in over half. Moreover, many GI diseases sometimes resemble eating
      disorders. Inflammatory bowel disease, acid peptic diseases, and intestinal
      motility disorders such as achalasia may mimic eating disorders. However, it is
      usually possible to distinguish these by applying the diagnostic criteria for
      eating disorders and by obtaining common biochemical tests. The primary features 
      of AN are profound weight loss due to self starvation and body image distortion; 
      BN is characterized by binge eating and self purging of ingested food by vomiting
      or laxative abuse. GI complications in eating disorders are common. Recurrent
      emesis in BN is associated with dental abnormalities, parotid enlargement, and
      electrolyte disturbances including metabolic alkalosis. Hyperamylasemia of
      salivary origin is regularly seen, but may lead do an erroneous diagnosis of
      pancreatitis. Despite the weight loss often seen in eating disorders, serum
      albumin, cholesterol, and carotene are usually normal. However, serum levels of
      trace metals such as zinc and copper often are depressed, and hypophosphatemia
      can occur during refeeding. Patients with eating disorders frequently have
      gastric emptying abnormalities, causing bloating, postprandial fullness, and
      vomiting. This usually improves with refeeding, but sometimes treatment with
      pro-motility agents such as metoclopromide is necessary. Knowledge of the GI
      manifestations of eating disorders, and a high index of suspicion for one
      condition masquerading as the other, are required for the correct diagnosis and
      management of these patients.

TI  - Disposition of olsalazine and metabolites in breast milk.
PG  - 703-6
AB  - This study examined the disposition of olsalazine and its metabolites into breast
      milk after the ingestion of a single dose of 500 mg olsalazine. Blood and serum
      samples were obtained for 48 hours after the ingestion of 500 mg olsalazine in a 
      39-year-old lactating woman. Blood samples were obtained at .0, .5, 1, 2, 4,6,
      24.5, 26, and 48 hours. Maternal milk samples were obtained at .0, .5, 2, 4, 6,
      14, 24, 28, 36, and 48 hours. Olsalazine and olsalazine-S underwent high-pressure
      liquid chromatography analysis, and 5-ASA and Ac 5-ASA underwent fluorometric
      detection. Acetylated-5-ASA achieved concentrations of .8, .86, and 1.24 mumol/L 
      in breast milk at 10, 14, and 24 hours, respectively. Olsalazine, olsalazine-S,
      and 5-ASA were undetectable in the breast milk for 48 hours after drug
      administration. Clinically significant drug exposure in the breast-fed infant is 
      unlikely after a maternal single dose of olsalazine. Idiosyncratic
      hypersensitivity, however, remains a possibility even if the infant is exposed to
      only minute quantities.

TI  - Does exclusion of enteral lipid assist remission in Crohn's disease?
PG  - 38-41
AB  - Based on the improvement of Crohn's disease (CD) with elemental diets, we treated
      a patient with recurrent stenosing disease using prednisolone and drastic
      reduction of oral lipid intake. Complete symptomatic and good radiological
      improvement took place. A newly proposed hypothesis for CD suggests that enteral 
      lipids together with certain luminal bacterial fragments become strongly
      antigenic to produce an inflammatory reaction analogous to the adjuvant response.
      Because of the apparent success of dietary lipid exclusion in this patient, we
      suggest that it be considered as a future option for management of acute CD.

TI  - Food intolerance and Crohn's disease.
PG  - 783-7
AB  - It has been claimed that prolonged remissions of Crohn's disease can be achieved 
      after enteral or parenteral nutrition, by identifying and excluding foods that
      exacerbate a patient's symptoms. The occurrence of food intolerances were
      assessed after induction of remission with elemental diet in 42 eligible patients
      to whom single foods were introduced over five days. Suspect foods were
      reinvestigated with open and if possible, double blind rechallenge. Fourteen
      patients (33%) dropped out of the study because of relapse of disease unrelated
      to food (n = 8) or because of difficulties in complying with the regimen (n = 6).
      Twenty (48%) of the patients identified food sensitivities whereas eight (19%)
      did not. Seventeen of the patients who identified food sensitivities had an open 
      rechallenge with recurrence of symptoms in 10 (24% of total). Food sensitivity
      was confirmed in three patients on double blind challenge. There was no
      significant difference in the duration of remission between patients who did or
      did not identify food sensitivities. During the study three cases of intolerance 
      to the formula diet, and one of severe salicylate sensitivity were encountered.
      In conclusion food sensitivities are evident after treatment of Crohn's disease
      with elemental diet but are variable, often do not persist, and are of
      insufficient importance to warrant putting all patients through elimination
      diets.

TI  - Home elemental enteral hyperalimentation (HEEH) for the maintenance of remission 
      in patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 379-84
AB  - Since specific treatment has not yet been decided on for Crohn's disease, the
      immediate target is the induction of remission and its maintenance. We examined
      the effects of an elemental diet (ED) in Crohn's disease with special reference
      to the maintenance of remission. Eighty-four patients received total enteral
      nutrition with the ED (35 to 40 kcal/kg ideal body weight/day) and/or
      conventional drug treatment for induction of remission. Sixty-one patients in
      remission were then followed-up with prolonged ED therapy (home elemental enteral
      hyperalimentation, HEEH) and/or drugs. During the follow-up periods the course of
      patients receiving HEEH was better than those of patients without HEEH, namely
      the cumulative continuous remission rates after one, 2 and 4 years were, 94%, 63%
      and 63% in the group receiving HEEH, 75%, 66% and 66% in the group receiving HEEH
      and drugs, 63%, 42% and 0% in the group receiving drugs, and 50%, 33% and 0% in
      the group receiving no maintenance therapy, respectively. In particular, when
      more than 30 kcal/kg ideal body weight/day of the ED was given, the maintenance
      of remission was successful in 95% of the patients. These results indicated that 
      ED therapy was effective not only for the induction of remission but also for the
      maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease.

PG  - 53-8
AB  - In the radioimmunoassay of human plasma cholecystokinin (CCK) using an antiserum 
      OAL-656, it has been difficult to get stable fasting values as well as prominent 
      postprandial increase. Therefore, we tried to extract human plasma with ethanol
      before the radioimmunoassay, and could solve these problems, that is fasting
      concentrations became stable (16.7 +/- 2.5 pg/ml) (mean +/- S.D., n = 9), and CCK
      concentrations were augmented promptly after feeding and were kept at higher
      levels for a certain period.

AB  - Orocaecal transit time (OCTT) using the lactulose hydrogen breath test was
      investigated in 16 patients (age 10-19.4 years) with active Crohn disease (CD).
      Disease activity was assessed by the paediatric CD activity index (PCDAI). OCTT
      was prolonged in all patients (mean 149.9 min, SD 32.7) relative to healthy
      age-matched controls (mean 56.9 min, SD 11.1). PCDAI was increased (median 48.8, 
      range 32.5), indicating moderate to severe disease in all patients. A close
      correlation between OCTT and PCDAI (Spearman r = 0.90) was observed. Following
      nutritional therapy with a semi-elemental diet over a period of 6 weeks OCTT and 
      PCDAI declined, OCTT becoming normal in 4 and PCDAI in 4/12 patients
      respectively. OCTT provides a sensitive, non-invasive method for the assessment
      and followup investigations in patients with CD.

      study.
PG  - 129-34
AB  - In a randomized, single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study, 20 
      patients with established Crohn's disease suffering from diarrhea and moderate
      complaints as measured by the BEST Index, were treated with the yeast preparation
      Saccharomyces boulardii (S.b.) in a dosage of 250 mg t.i.d., initially for two
      weeks in addition to the basic treatment. A reduction in the frequency of bowel
      movements (5.0 +/- 1.4 vs. 4.1 +/- 2.3 evacuations/day, p < 0.01) and in the BEST
      Index (193 +/- 32 vs. 168 +/- 59, p < 0.05) as compared to baseline was
      registered. After this initial phase, the patients were allocated in randomized
      order to the control group (n = 7) receiving placebo, or to the verum group (n = 
      10) receiving S.b.(250 mg t.i.d.) for 7 weeks, while the basic treatment was
      maintained. The group treated with S.b. showed a significant reduction in the
      frequency of bowel movements in the tenth week, to 3.3 +/- 1.2 evacuations per
      day, and in the BEST Index, to 107 +/- 85. In the control group taking placebo,
      however, this effect was not observed. By contrast, the frequency of bowel
      movements and the BEST Index rose again in the tenth week until reaching initial 
      values (4.6 +/- 1.9 evacuations daily and 180 +/- 61, respectively). No adverse
      drug events were observed. In order to confirm these positive effects of S.b. in 
      patients with Crohn's disease, further controlled multicenter trials in a larger 
      patient population should be performed.
