TI  - [Increased IgE-type antibody response to food allergens in irritable bowel
      syndrome and inflammatory bowel diseases].
PG  - 797-802
AB  - BACKGROUND: The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder
      characterized by symptoms of abdominal pain that is associated with disturbed
      defecation. Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC) are collectively
      referred to as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). IBD appears to result from
      dysregulated immune response with contributions from genetic predisposition and
      environmental factors. Among environmental factors the enteric microflora and the
      components of food (eg. antigens) may play important role in the pathogenesis of 
      IBD. The aim of the authors' study was to detect IgE type antibodies against the 
      most frequent food allergens in patients with IBD and IBS. METHODS: Antibodies
      against food allergens (IgE type) with ELISA method in patients with CD, UC and
      IBS were quantitatively measured. The figures were compared to the result of a
      healthy control group contains the same number of participants, and the frequency
      of food allergy in these patient groups were determined. RESULTS: On the basis of
      the study the presence of increased IgE type immune response against any food
      allergens was 34.5% (p = 0.01) in the group of IBS. In patients with CD or UC the
      immune response against food allergens was also more frequent than in the control
      group. The order of frequency of food allergens in IBS was the following: milk
      protein, soybean, tomato, peanut, egg white. CONCLUSION: As the occurrence of
      food allergens was significantly higher in IBS group than in the control group,
      the role of food allergy in the symptoms of IBS can be come up. The frequency of 
      food allergy in patients with diagnosis of IBS, and the similarity of symptoms of
      this two diseases give an obvious opportunity for the patients with IBS to use a 
      diet avoiding the most frequent food allergens, or take e.g. Na-cromoglycate
      which is useful therapy in food allergy.

TI  - [Pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases].
PG  - 1965-73
AB  - Genetic predisposition, nutritional and environmental influences, intestinal
      pathogens, psychological stress, and disturbed intestinal barrier function have
      been accepted as important factors in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory
      bowel diseases. Uncontrolled reactions of T-cells and proinflammatoric cytokines 
      are the common denominator of all factors contributing to pathogenesis. The
      detection of NOD2 gene mutation in about 25% of patients with Crohn's disease was
      an important step towards an understanding of the molecular background of the
      disease. The NOD2 proteins functions as an intracellular sensor of bacterial cell
      membrane constituents and is a crucial part of the innate immune system. In
      Crohn's disease, the secretion of defensins, naturally occurring antimicrobial
      peptides, is disturbed. There is evidence that several pathways involved in the
      reaction of the innate immune system may be disturbed in CED, ultimately leading 
      to an uncontrolled activity of the adaptive immune system.

TI  - Clinical usefulness of probiotics in inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 23-33
AB  - Probiotics are live nonpathogenic bacteria or bacterial components that may be
      helpful in the prevention and treatment of acute diarrhoea in adults and children
      and have some effects on the course of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Many
      experimental and clinical studies suggest that intestinal bacterial flora plays
      an important role in the pathogenesis of IBD, and manipulation of the luminal
      contents with antibiotics or probiotics represents a potentially effective
      therapeutic option. The beneficial effect of probiotics was demonstrated mainly
      in the prevention and treatment of pouchitis and in maintaining remission of mild
      to moderate ulcerative colitis. Probiotics seems to be less effective in patients
      with Crohn's disease. Randomized clinical trials are still required to further
      define the role of probiotics as preventive and therapeutic agents. This review
      summarizes the current data about probiotics in IBD.

TI  - Data mining for correlations between diet and Crohn's disease activity.
PG  - 897
AB  - Crohn's disease is a debilitating condition that affects the entire
      gastrointestinal tract and often requires aggressive and invasive therapies.
      Several studies have suggested dietary triggers for disease activity. We have
      created a web-based tool to allow participants to record both daily food intake
      and wellness (i.e., disease-specific quality of life). We seek to determine if
      measurable correlations exist between these events in patients with Crohn's
      disease. Advanced data mining techniques are employed to find such correlations
      and the efficacies of chosen techniques are assessed. We tested our web-based
      system in a pilot study involving 7 participants, and we found that traditional
      statistical techniques identified diet and disease activity correlations in
      short-term data sets.

TI  - Pulse granulomas detected in gallbladder, fallopian tube, and skin.
PG  - 1839-42
AB  - CONTEXT: Foreign material typically elicits reactions dominated by multinucleated
      giant cells. Pulse granulomas are peculiar reactions to particles of food that
      are characterized by clusters of small to medium-sized hyaline rings. Pulse
      granulomas are rare and have occupied only the lungs, in association with
      aspiration, and the alimentary canal, in association with oral pathology, colonic
      diverticula, and a rectal mass. OBJECTIVE: To report pulse granulomas that
      occupied previously unrecognized sites and to alert pathologists to the
      diagnostic pitfall of mistaking pulse granulomas for other entities. DESIGN: We
      retrospectively reviewed 3 recently encountered cases that involved pulse
      granulomas in the gallbladder, fallopian tube, and skin. RESULTS: In all cases,
      pulse granulomas were associated with fistulae involving the gastrointestinal
      tract. One fistula was clinically occult. Microscopy showed barium-laden
      histiocytes admixed with hyaline rings, with or without vegetable matter,
      confirming fistulae involving the gastrointestinal tract. Absence of other
      features of chronicity, including sarcoid-type granulomas and Langhans-type giant
      cells, helped to essentially exclude Crohn disease. In 1 case, hyaline rings of
      pulse granulomas closely resembled hyaline vasculopathy of amyloidosis, diabetes,
      or hypertension. Surprisingly, polariscopy failed to detect any vegetable matter.
      In 1 case, negative polariscopy contributed to the difficulty in finding rare
      vegetable matter. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that pulse granulomas can occur
      outside the lungs and alimentary canal, and can be associated with fistulae
      involving the gastrointestinal tract. Awareness of this finding is necessary to
      avoid confusion with Crohn disease and hyaline vasculopathy. Polariscopy may fail
      to detect vegetable matter.

TI  - Low intestinal glutamine level and low glutaminase activity in Crohn's disease: a
      rational for glutamine supplementation?
PG  - 2170-9
AB  - Intestinal glutamine utilization is integral to mucosal regeneration. We analyzed
      the systemic and intestinal glutamine status in Crohn's disease (CD) and
      evaluated the therapeutic effect of glutamine supplementation in an animal model 
      of ileitis. In CD, glutamine concentrations were decreased systemically and in
      noninflamed and inflamed ileal/colonic mucosa. Mucosal glutaminase activities
      were depressed in the ileum independent of inflammation but were not different
      from controls in the colon. In experimental ileitis, oral glutamine feeding
      prevented macroscopic inflammation, enhanced ileal and colonic glutaminase
      activities above controls, and normalized the intestinal glutathione redox
      status. However, glutamine supplementation enhanced myeloperoxidase activity
      along the gastrointestinal tract and potentiated lipid peroxidation in the colon.
      In conclusion, glutamine metabolism is impaired in CD. In experimental ileitis,
      glutamine supplementation prevents inflammatory tissue damage. In the colon,
      however, which does not use glutamine as its principal energy source, immune
      enhancement of inflammatory cells by glutamine increases oxidative tissue injury.

TI  - Effectiveness of an 'half elemental diet' as maintenance therapy for Crohn's
      disease: A randomized-controlled trial.
PG  - 1333-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although thiopurines have a proven role in maintenance therapy for
      Crohn's disease, an alternative therapy is needed for patients intolerant or
      resistant to thiopurines. AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of home enteral
      nutrition as a maintenance therapy regimen in which half of the daily calorie
      requirement is provided by an elemental diet and the remaining half by a free
      diet. We refer to this home enteral nutrition therapy as 'half elemental diet'.
      METHODS: Between 2002 and 2005, 51 patients in remission from two hospitals were 
      randomly assigned to a half elemental diet group (n = 26) or a free diet group (n
      = 25). The primary outcome measure of this study was the occurrence of relapse
      over the 2-year period. RESULTS: The relapse rate in the half elemental diet
      group was significantly lower [34.6% vs. 64.0%; multivariate hazard ratio 0.40
      (95% CI: 0.16-0.98)] than that in the free diet group after a mean follow-up of
      11.9 months. Compliance was similar in the two groups. No adverse event occurred 
      in any of the patients throughout the study. CONCLUSION: This
      randomized-controlled trial shows the effectiveness of an half elemental diet,
      which is a promising maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease patients.

TI  - Probiotics: do they help to control intestinal inflammation?
PG  - 339-50
AB  - There is currently a growing appreciation for the role of the enteric flora in
      health and disease. In the past years overwhelming evidence has accumulated for
      the role of commensal gut bacteria in the inflammatory bowel diseases Crohn's
      disease and ulcerative colitis. Both entities are mainly located in areas with
      high bacterial concentrations. Reduction of the enteric bacterial concentration
      by antibiotics, lavage, or surgical bypass results in a mitigation of symptoms,
      while experimental colitis models depend on the presence of the bacterial flora
      and the NOD2/CARD15-mutation results in inefficient clearance of invasive
      bacteria. Those findings helped to bring the concept of probiotic therapy to the 
      forefront, a therapy that had been known for millennia, but had been disregarded 
      by the scientific world. Probiotics are meanwhile established in the maintenance 
      therapy of ulcerative colitis and chronic recurrent or refractory pouchitis.
      Promising data exist for the primary prevention of pouchitis. Probiotic research 
      at the intersection of gastroenterology, immunology and microbiology is highly
      dynamic in both the basic and the clinical field. Further understanding of the
      complex molecular mechanisms leading to the effectiveness of probiotics will also
      spur the development of more successful probiotic formulations.

TI  - Probiotics for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease.
PG  - CD004826
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is characterised by episodes of disease activity
      and symptom-free remission. Probiotics are microorganisms that can potentially
      benefit health, and have been evaluated as an alternate means of preventing
      relapse in patients with CD. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of
      probiotics for the maintenance of remission in CD. SEARCH STRATEGY: The following
      databases were searched: the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005, Issue
      3); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2005, Issue 3); the
      Cochrane IBD/FBD Group Trials Register (2005), MEDLINE (1966-2005); EMBASE
      (1980-2005); ISI Web of Knowledge (BIDS) 1981-2005; On-line clinical trials
      databases (2005); and review articles. Experts in the field were contacted for
      unpublished data. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of probiotic
      therapy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two independent reviewers performed data
      extraction and assessment of methodological quality. The primary outcome was the 
      relative risk (RR) of relapse after maintenance treatment (and 95% confidence
      intervals [CI]). MAIN RESULTS: Seven small studies were identified and varied
      according to probiotics tested, methodological quality and medication regimen. No
      studies were pooled for statistical analysis. There was no statistically
      significant benefit of E. coli Nissle for reducing the risk of relapse compared
      to placebo (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.20), or Lactobacillus GG after
      surgically-induced remission (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.30 to 8.40) or medically-induced 
      remission (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.80). There was no statistically significant 
      benefit of probiotics for reducing the risk of relapse compared to maintenance
      therapy employing aminosalicylates or azathioprine (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.13 to
      3.30), and in this study the probiotic Lactobacillus GG was associated with
      adverse events. In children, there was there was no statistically significant
      difference between Lactobacillus GG and placebo for reducing the risk of relapse 
      (RR 1.85, 95% CI 0.77 to 4.40). A small study using the yeast Saccharomyces
      boulardii demonstrated a difference that was not statistically significant in
      favour of probiotic combined with a reduced level of maintenance therapy over
      standard maintenance treatment alone (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.23). AUTHORS'
      CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence to suggest that probiotics are beneficial for
      the maintenance of remission in CD. All of the included studies enrolled small
      numbers of patients and may have lacked statistical power to show differences
      should they exist. Larger trials are required to determine if probiotics are of
      benefit in Crohn's disease.

TI  - The Vitamin D analogue TX 527 blocks NF-kappaB activation in peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells of patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 51-60
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) is an inflammatory disease characterized by the activation
      of the immune system in the gut. Since tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) plays an
      important role in the initiation and perpetuation of intestinal inflammation in
      CD, we investigated whether TX 527 [19-nor-14,20-bisepi-23-yne-1,25(OH)(2)D(3)], 
      a Vitamin D analogue, could affect peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
      proliferation and exert an immunosuppressive effect on TNF-alpha production in CD
      patients, and whether this immunosuppressive action could be mediated by
      NF-kappaB down-regulation. TX 527 significantly decreased cell proliferation and 
      TNF-alpha levels. On activation, NF-kappaB, rapidly released from its
      cytoplasmatic inhibitor (IKB-alpha), transmigrates into the nucleus and binds to 
      DNA response elements in gene promoter regions. The activation of NF-kappaB,
      stimulated by TNF-alpha, and its nuclear translocation together with the
      degradation of IKB-alpha were blocked by TX 527. At the same time, NF-kappaB
      protein levels present in cytoplasmic extracts decreased in the presence of
      TNF-alpha and increased when PBMC were incubated with TX 527. The results of our 
      studies indicate that TX 527 inhibits TNF-alpha mediated effects on PBMC and the 
      activation of NF-kappaB and that its action is mediated by Vitamin D receptor
      (VDR), which is activated when the cells are stimulated with TX 527.

TI  - Case report: evidence for transplacental transfer of maternally administered
      infliximab to the newborn.
PG  - 1255-8
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Control of Crohn's disease (CD) is important for conception
      and sustaining a pregnancy to term. Small series of infliximab use during
      pregnancy have reported favorable fetal and maternal outcomes. As a result of
      heightened maternal concern triggered by recent labeling changes, infliximab
      levels were measured in the newborn of a mother treated with infliximab. METHODS:
      Serum and breast milk infliximab levels were measured by enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: A 32-year-old woman with treatment-refractory CD
      continued infliximab therapy throughout pregnancy. Five infusions of infliximab, 
      10 mg/kg, the last one 2 weeks before delivery, successfully controlled her
      symptoms. Six weeks after delivery, the breast-fed infant's serum infliximab
      level was 39.5 microg/mL. Infliximab was not detected in the breast milk. Serial 
      measurements revealed a continued slow decline of the infant's infliximab levels 
      during the following 6 months, despite resumption of breast-feeding and
      subsequent retreatments of the mother with infliximab. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically
      significant infliximab levels were detected in the offspring. High infliximab
      levels in the serum of this infant are likely due to placental transfer, not
      breast-feeding. Similar to other maternally acquired antibodies, the half-life of
      infliximab appears prolonged in newborns. The true short-term and long-term
      implications of exposure to infliximab during the newborn period are unknown.
      Patients and physicians must be informed about in utero exposure to infliximab
      and potentially other therapeutic antibodies. The timing of infusions to minimize
      antibody transfer to the fetus might be an important strategic consideration when
      therapeutic antibodies are used in pregnancy.

TI  - Current therapy of inflammatory bowel disease in children.
PG  - 279-302
AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD) are chronic intestinal
      inflammatory diseases that can present as bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and
      malnutrition. Collectively, these disorders are referred to as inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). All patients with IBD share a common pathophysiology. However,
      there are a number of developmental, psychosocial, and physiologic issues that
      are unique to the approximate, equals 20% of patients that present during
      childhood or adolescence. These include the possibility of disease-induced delays
      in linear growth or physical development, differences in drug dosing, and the
      changes in social and cognitive development that occur as children move from
      school-age years into adolescence and early adulthood. Gastroenterologists caring
      for these children must therefore develop an optimal regimen of pharmacologic
      therapies, nutritional management, psychologic support, and properly timed
      surgery (when necessary) that will maintain disease remission, minimize disease
      and drug-induced adverse effects, and optimize growth and development. This
      article reviews current approaches to the management of patients with UC and CD
      and highlights issues specific to the treatment of children with IBD. The
      principal medical therapies used to induce disease remission in patients with UC 
      are aminosalicylates (for mild disease), corticosteroids (for moderate disease), 
      and cyclosporine (ciclosporin) (for severe disease). If a patient responds to the
      induction regimen, maintenance therapies that are used to prevent disease relapse
      include aminosalicylates, mercaptopurine, and azathioprine. Colectomy with
      creation of an ileal pouch anal anastomosis (J pouch) has become the standard of 
      care for patients with severe or refractory colitis and results in an improved
      quality of life in most patients. Therefore, the risks associated with using
      increasingly potent immunosuppressant agents must be balanced in each case
      against a patient's desire to retain their colon and avoid a temporary or
      potentially permanent ileostomy. Decisions about drug therapy in the management
      of patients with CD are more complex and depend on both the location (e.g.
      gastroduodenal vs small intestinal vs colonic), as well as the behavior of the
      disease (inflammatory/mucosal vs stricturing vs perforating) in a given patient. 
      Induction therapies for CD typically include aminosalicylates and antibiotics
      (for mild mucosal disease), nutritional therapy (including elemental or polymeric
      formulas), corticosteroids (for moderate disease), and infliximab (for
      corticosteroid-resistant or fistulizing disease). Aminosalicylates,
      mercaptopurine, azathioprine, methotrexate, and infliximab can be used as
      maintenance therapies. Because surgical treatment of CD is not curative, it is
      typically reserved for those patients either with persistent symptoms and disease
      limited to a small section of the intestine (e.g. the terminal ileum and cecum)
      or for the management of complications of the disease including stricture or
      abdominal abscess. When surgery is necessary, maintenance medications
      administered postoperatively will postpone recurrence. Patients with UC and CD
      are at risk for the development of micronutrient deficiencies (including folate, 
      iron, and vitamin D deficiencies) and require close nutritional monitoring. In
      addition, patients with UC and CD involving the colon are at increased risk of
      developing colon cancer, and should be enrolled into a colonoscopy surveillance
      program after 8-10 years of disease duration.

AB  - Current data show that probiotics are more effective in preventing the
      recrudescence of an inflammatory process than in suppressing active disease. This
      is reflected in the solid evidence for the effect of E. coli Nissle 1917
      (Mutaflor) in the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis, and of VSL#3 in
      preventing the recurrence of pouchitis. These indications have since been
      incorporated in valid guidelines. Initial clinical studies have also provided
      promising results regarding the efficacy of VSL#3 in preventing pouchitis
      immediately following proctocolectomy.

TI  - Sources and severity of self-reported food intolerance after ileal pouch-anal
      anastomosis.
PG  - 1459-62
AB  - Data on food intolerance after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis are scarce. The aim
      of this study was to identify foods causing intolerance and to determine the
      nature and severity of reported symptoms. Patients from the Dutch Crohn's and
      Ulcerative Colitis Association were mailed a survey on food intolerance; 105 (31%
      men) of 137 patients took part. They all reported intolerance to one or more
      foods. Common symptoms (scored from 0=absent to 10=severe), included diarrhea
      (mean score=5.8), fatigue (mean score=5.5), and thirst (mean score=4.6). Spicy
      foods, cabbage, and citrus fruits (or juice) were most likely to decrease stool
      consistency, increase stool frequency, or cause perianal irritation. Onions,
      cabbage, or leeks were reported by 28% of the patients to cause flatulence. The
      urge to defecate was stronger after a cooked meal (45% within (1/2) hour) than
      after sandwiches (15% within (1/2) hour). Foods reported to increase stool
      consistency were potato products, bread, and bananas. This study demonstrates
      that food intolerance is a common, albeit mild, problem after ileal pouch-anal
      anastomosis. Food and nutrition professionals should encourage patients to base
      their food choices on individual tolerance as long as no (patho-)
      physiological-based evidence to the contrary is available.

TI  - Review article: can post-operative recurrence in Crohn's disease be prevented?
PG  - 22-8
AB  - The decision regarding prophylactic treatment after surgery in Crohn's disease
      (CD) requires a good estimation of the risk of recurrence. It is also important
      to consider the consequences of recurrence for the patient, and the risks and
      benefits of treatment, bearing in mind that it will be given over a long period. 
      Several drugs have been tried to decrease the risk of recurrence. Corticosteroids
      and budesonide have proved to be ineffective. Mesalazine has significant efficacy
      in some, but not all trials, and a meta-analysis has established that it
      decreases the absolute risk by 10-15% after 1-2 years. Mercaptopurine seemed to
      be effective in a recent study. Metronidazole and ornidazole have significant
      efficacy, but cannot be tolerated for long periods. Probiotics represent a new
      approach, but evidence for their efficacy in CD is still lacking. In the past,
      the strategy was to give no treatment until clinical recurrence. Another approach
      is to give no treatment, and then to treat the patient according to severity of
      endoscopic recurrence. Alternative strategies include treating all patients with 
      mesalazine until either severe endoscopic or clinical recurrence occurs, and then
      to use azathioprine/mercaptopurine, or to give azathioprine/mercaptopurine
      immediately, especially in high-risk patients.

TI  - The use of electrogastrography and external ultrasonography to evaluate gastric
      motility in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 277-84
AB  - Although Crohn's disease is associated with various digestive symptoms, there
      have been few reports on gastric motility. In this study, we conducted a study of
      gastric motility in Crohn's disease using 20 healthy subjects (N group) and 15
      patients with Crohn's disease (C group) by electrogastrography (EGG) using a
      Nipro electrogastrograph. An EGG was recorded for 30 minutes in a fasting state
      and after ingestion of 300 ml of a liquid meal. As an index of gastric emptying, 
      the rate of change in the cross-sectional area of the gastric antrum was measured
      1 and 15 minutes after ingestion of the liquid meal by external ultrasonography. 
      In an EGG frequency analysis, waveforms with a peak of 3 cycles/minute (cpm) were
      noted in the N group, and the peak amplitude increased significantly after the
      ingestion of food. In the C group, division of the normal-gastria component was
      noted after the ingestion of food in 5 patients (33.3%). In a comparison of the
      peak amplitudes of fasting brady-gastria, normal-gastria, and tachy-gastria
      between the N and C groups, the peak amplitude was significantly increased in
      normal-gastria in the N group, and in brady-gastria and tachy-gastria in the C
      group. In a comparison of the rates of food ingestion-induced changes in the peak
      amplitudes for brady-gastria, normal-gastria, and tachy-gastria between the N and
      C groups, the peak amplitudes were significantly increased in normal-gastria in
      the N group, but not in the C group. In the case of gastric emptying investigated
      by external ultrasonography, the rate of food ingestion-induced change in the
      cross-sectional antrum area was significantly lower in the C group (50.5+/-9.2%) 
      than in the N group (65.0+/-8.5%). For gastrointestinal motility, a 3 cpm
      normal-gastria represents efficient gastric motility. In the C group, the peak
      amplitudes of brady-gastria and tachy-gastria were significantly increased, but
      were low in normal-gastria in the fasting EGG, postprandial division of the
      normal-gastria component was noted, and the rate of food ingestion-induced
      increase in the normal-gastria peak amplitude was significantly lower than that
      in the N group, suggesting that patients with Crohn's disease have a functional
      abnormality in, not only the small and large intestine, but also the stomach.

TI  - Malabsorption is a major contributor to underweight in Crohn's disease patients
      in remission.
PG  - 855-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Undernutrition has been reported in 65-75% of patients with Crohn's
      disease. The present study aimed at identifying the relative contribution of
      malnutrition-causing factors in patients with Crohn's disease in remission.
      METHODS: Sixteen patients with Crohn's disease (age 19-57 y) in remission
      (Crohn's Activity Disease Index < 150) were included in the study. Their weight
      was stable for >3 mo and they were off steroids. They all completed 3-d food
      records and concomitantly collected stools. Self-reported food records were
      analyzed and energy content in stools was determined by a direct bomb
      calorimeter. Resting energy expenditure (REE) was studied by indirect calorimetry
      and body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The study cohort was
      divided into two groups, with a body mass index (BMI) equal to 18.5 kg/m(2)
      serving as a cutoff point. RESULTS: Subjects with lower BMIs tended to have less 
      lean body mass (P = 0.006), less bone mineral density (P = 0.006), and lower REE 
      (P = 0.003). No correlation was found between BMI and energy intake but the
      percentage of malabsorption was negatively correlated with BMI (P = 0.07). When
      dividing the study based on a BMI of 18.5 kg/m(2), no difference was found in
      caloric intake or REE between groups but subjects with lower BMIs had significant
      prominent malabsorption compared with the others (21.1 +/- 9.8% versus 11.7 +/-
      3.5%, P = 0.015). CONCLUSION: In the presence of similar energy intake, REE does 
      not seem to contribute to lower BMI, although nutrient malabsorption is higher in
      malnourished patients with Crohn's disease in remission. We suggest that
      malabsorption be evaluated in patients with Crohn's disease who fail to gain
      weight during disease remission to establish their extra caloric requirements.

TI  - Multiple sclerosis, natalizumab therapy, and progressive multifocal
      leukoencephalopathy.
PG  - 341-9
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Multiple sclerosis affects many people, often in early
      adulthood, and causes significant disability. Natalizumab is a novel agent to be 
      evaluated for multiple sclerosis and Crohn's disease that has demonstrated unique
      efficacy but has unfortunately been implicated in three cases of progressive
      multifocal leukoencephalopathy. This review covers the mechanism of action of
      natalizumab and efficacy for multiple sclerosis, the three cases of
      natalizumab-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, our
      understanding of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and the mechanisms
      that may account for these events. RECENT FINDINGS: Natalizumab, an
      anti-alpha4-integrin antibody, binds to T-cell surface receptors to prevent
      migration from the circulation into the brain tissue. Phase II and III trials
      have been completed and demonstrate previously unseen efficacy in preventing
      relapses and disease progression. The cases of progressive multifocal
      leukoencephalopathy, two fatal and one disabling, resulted in the voluntary
      suspension of natalizumab and bring this entire class of agents into doubt. It is
      important to determine what led to the development of progressive multifocal
      leukoencephalopathy in the natalizumab-associated cases and to advance
      understanding and continue to develop therapies for the treatment of multiple
      sclerosis. SUMMARY: With ongoing safety evaluations, natalizumab is being
      reevaluated by the US Food and Drug Administration for possible reapproval and
      return to the market. If natalizumab is reapproved, challenging questions and
      issues will remain in treating patients with multiple sclerosis.

TI  - The bacteriology of biopsies differs between newly diagnosed, untreated, Crohn's 
      disease and ulcerative colitis patients.
PG  - 1141-9
AB  - The bacterial community (microbiota) that inhabits the gut of humans appears to
      be an important source of antigens that drive the chronic immunological processes
      characteristic of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Most of the
      members of the microbiota have not yet been cultured, but nucleic-acid-based
      methods of detection and enumeration can provide information about the community.
      This investigation used these methods to obtain information about the bacteria
      associated with mucosal surfaces in the gut of 20 CD and 15 UC patients. Biopsies
      were collected from inflamed and non-inflamed sites in the intestines of newly
      diagnosed, untreated patients. Biopsies were also collected from several
      intestinal sites of 14 healthy subjects. The bacterial collections associated
      with the biopsies were analysed by generating PCR/denaturing gradient gel
      electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles, the preparation of 16S rRNA gene clone
      libraries, and qualitative PCR to detect specific groups of bacteria. The total
      numbers of bacteria associated with the biopsies were determined by real-time
      quantitative PCR. DGGE profiles generated from the terminal ileum and various
      colonic regions were characteristic of each individual but differed between
      subjects. DGGE profiles and 16S rRNA gene libraries showed that the bacteria
      associated with inflamed and non-inflamed tissues did not differ. UC patients had
      more bacteria associated with biopsies than did CD patients (P<0.01). Statistical
      analysis of the composition of 16S rRNA gene libraries showed that the bacterial 
      collections in UC and CD patients differed (P<0.05). Unclassified members of the 
      phylum Bacteroidetes were more prevalent in CD than in UC patients. Therefore,
      the types and numbers of bacteria associated with biopsy samples were distinctly 
      different for UC and CD patients. The observations made in this study should
      permit targeting of specific bacteriological abnormalities in investigations of
      the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases and provide targets for medical
      interventions.

TI  - Paratuberculosis and Type I diabetes: is this the trigger?
PG  - 782-5
AB  - Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is an autoimmune disease. The etiology of T1DM is
      incompletely understood but environmental agent(s) are thought to trigger T1DM in
      the genetically at risk. Exposure to cow's milk early in life is a recognized
      risk factor in the development of T1DM. Mycobacterium avium ss. paratuberculosis 
      (MAP) is the cause of bovine Johne's disease and also is thought to act as an
      immune antigen in Crohn's disease and other granulomatous diseases. MAP is shed
      in cow's milk and has been shown to survive pasteurization. Genetic
      susceptibilities, epitope homologies and epidemiologic studies are presented that
      support MAP as a causative agent of T1DM in the genetically at risk.

TI  - [Non-specific inflammatory bowel disease or allergic colitis in small children - 
      what is the final diagnosis].
PG  - 475-82
AB  - The reason of bleeding from alimentary tract in small children - may sometimes be
      a big problem and we may need a long observation before making the diagnosis. One
      of the most frequent reasons of bleeding is food allergy, which resembles
      allergic colitis. However, bleeding can be the first symptom of ulcerative
      colitis or Crohn's disease, but it is very rare in small children. We present
      three cases of small children with bleeding from alimentary tract, in which it
      was difficult to make the final diagnosis. In our cases, the endoscopic and
      histopathological examination showed changes, which suggested non-specific
      inflammatory bowel disease. The microabscesses in crypts and inflammatory
      infiltration in the mucosa indicated ulcerative colitis. Moreover, one child had 
      also inflammatory infiltration in the oesophagus and duodenum, which is typical
      for Crohn's disease. We conclude that even when the clinical course suggests that
      the reason of presenting symptoms was food allergy, there is need for longer
      observation until one can make the final diagnosis.

TI  - Effect of concurrent elemental diet on infliximab treatment for Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1143-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infliximab and elemental diet (ED) have been shown to be effective in
      the management of Crohn's disease. However, few experiences have been reported
      regarding their combination therapy. The aim of the present study was to
      investigate the efficacy and safety of infliximab in Japanese patients, the first
      such study in Asia, as well as the effect of concomitant ED. METHODS: One hundred
      and ten consecutive patients receiving infliximab were followed up to week 16
      after the last infusion, and clinical response and primary outcome were
      collected. A response was defined as a reduction in Harvey-Bradshaw Index for
      inflammatory disease and closure of fistula in fistulizing disease. RESULTS: Out 
      of 75 inflammatory and 35 fistulizing disease patients, 68 (90.7%) and 25 (71.4%)
      responded at week 4, and 38 (50.7%) and 14 (40.0%) continued to respond until
      week 16, respectively. Interestingly, inflammatory disease patients with
      concurrent ED had a significantly higher response rate at week 16 (68.4%) than
      those without ED (32.4%, P = 0.0026). The effects of ED were independent of the
      usage of azathioprine and smoking habit. CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab was clinically
      useful in the treatment of Crohn's disease in Japanese patients as well as in
      those in Western countries. The efficacy of concurrent ED was suggestive and
      should be confirmed in a randomized controlled study.

TI  - Novel strategies to attenuate immune activation in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 401-7
AB  - Our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms that underlie the chronic
      intestinal inflammation characteristic of Crohn's disease (CD) has advanced
      greatly in recent years. We now realize that effective treatment will not be
      achieved through non-specific generalized immunosuppression, but rather with the 
      development of well-designed therapies that target specific immunological
      pathways. The success of infliximab has driven exploration into the blockade of
      additional pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-12 and
      interferon-gamma. Novel strategies have also emerged that target other components
      of the inflammatory cascade, such as the migration of leukocytes to the
      intestine. The identification of mutations in the nod2/card15 gene that are
      associated with a predisposition for the development of CD has focused attention 
      on the role of the innate immune system in CD. This has allowed a fundamentally
      different approach to the development of therapies for CD aimed at intensifying
      innate immune responses. In parallel with the development of several 'biological'
      agents, alternative therapeutic options have also shown promising results. The
      use of probiotic bacteria as both therapeutic agents and delivery vehicles for
      other molecules is a rapidly developing field. As the role of regulatory T cells 
      in the pathogenesis of CD is revealed, the potential of immunotherapy is being
      opened up. With so many therapeutic options in sight and the ongoing elucidation 
      of the pathogenesis of CD, it will become steadily more possible to tailor
      treatment to the clinicopathological and immunogenetic profile of the individual 
      patient.

TI  - Antibiotics and probiotics in treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 3306-13
AB  - Many experimental and clinical observations suggest that intestinal microflora
      plays a potential role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
      Manipulation of the luminal content using antibiotics or probiotics represents a 
      potentially effective therapeutic option. The available studies do not support
      the use of antibiotics in ulcerative colitis (UC). Antibiotics are effective in
      treating septic complications of Crohn's disease (CD) but their use as a primary 
      therapy is more controversial, although this approach is frequently and
      successfully adopted in clinical practice. There is evidence that probiotic
      therapy may be effective in the prevention and treatment of mild to moderate UC. 
      In contrast, a lack of successful study data at present precludes the widespread 
      use of probiotics in the treatment of CD. Both antibiotics and probiotics appear 
      to play a beneficial role in the treatment and prevention of pouchitis and
      further trials are warranted to fully quantify their clinical efficacy.

TI  - ESPEN Guidelines on Enteral Nutrition: Gastroenterology.
PG  - 260-74
AB  - Undernutrition as well as specific nutrient deficiencies have been described in
      patients with Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and short bowel
      syndrome (SBS). The present guideline gives evidence-based recommendations for
      the indication, application and type of formula of enteral nutrition (EN) (oral
      nutritional supplements (ONS) or tube feeding (TF)) in these patients. It was
      developed in an interdisciplinary consensus-based process in accordance with
      officially accepted standards and is based on all relevant publications since
      1985. ONS and/or TF in addition to normal food is indicated in undernourished
      patients with CD or CU to improve nutritional status. In active CD EN is the
      first line therapy in children and should be used as sole therapy in adults
      mainly when treatment with corticosteroids is not feasible. No significant
      differences have been shown in the effects of free amino acid, peptide-based and 
      whole protein formulae for TF. In remission ONS is recommended only in steroid
      dependent patients in CD. In patients with SBS TF should be introduced in the
      adaptation phase and should be changed with progressing adaptation to ONS in
      addition to normal food.

TI  - Current understanding of the genetic diversity of Mycobacterium avium subsp.
      paratuberculosis.
PG  - 1406-18
AB  - Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is the etiological agent of
      Johne's disease (or paratuberculosis). Paratuberculosis is a chronic
      gastroenteritis mainly affecting cattle, sheep and other ruminants. MAP is also
      of concern due to the heretofore unresolved issue of its possible role in Crohn's
      disease in humans. We present here a review of MAP (i) mobile genetic elements;
      (ii) repetitive elements; (iii) single nucleotide polymorphisms; and (iv)
      whole-genome comparisons to study the molecular epidemiology of MAP. A summary of
      the findings to date is presented, and the discriminatory power, advantage and
      disadvantages of each of the methods are compared and discussed.

TI  - Polymeric diet alone versus corticosteroids in the treatment of active pediatric 
      Crohn's disease: a randomized controlled open-label trial.
PG  - 744-53
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nutritional therapy has been reported to have an almost
      equivalent efficacy of corticosteroids in achieving clinical remission in active 
      Crohn's disease (CD). However, the effects of both treatments on intestinal
      mucosal inflammation rarely are reported. In a randomized controlled trial in
      children with active CD we compared the efficacy of nutritional therapy alone or 
      corticosteroids on clinical variables and intestinal mucosal healing. METHODS: In
      a prospective, 10-week open-label trial, children with active, naive CD were
      randomized to orally polymeric formula alone or oral corticosteroids. The
      clinical activity index and nutritional and activity serum variables were
      evaluated at week 0 and then every 2 weeks; intestinal mucosal inflammation was
      assessed through endoscopy and histology at weeks 0 and 10. Primary efficacy
      outcomes were clinical remission and mucosal healing. RESULTS: Of the 37 children
      randomized, 19 received polymeric formula and 18 received corticosteroids. At
      week 10, on an intention-to-treat basis, the proportion of patients achieving
      clinical remission was comparable between the 2 groups (polymeric formula: 15/19 
      [79%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 56%-92%]; corticosteroid group: 12/18 [67%;
      95% CI, 44%-84%]; P = .4; not significant). On the contrary, the proportion of
      children showing mucosa healing was significantly higher in the polymeric (14/19;
      74%; 95% CI, 51%-89%) than the corticosteroid group (6/18 [33%; 95% CI, 16%-57%];
      P < .05). At week 10 both endoscopic and histologic scores significantly
      decreased only in the polymeric group (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: In children with
      active and recently diagnosed CD, a short course of polymeric diet is more
      effective than corticosteroids in inducing healing of gut inflammatory lesions.

TI  - Mechanisms of disease: the hygiene hypothesis revisited.
PG  - 275-84
AB  - In industrialized countries the incidence of diseases caused by immune
      dysregulation has risen. Epidemiologic studies initially suggested this was
      connected to a reduction in the incidence of infectious diseases; however, an
      association with defects in immunoregulation is now being recognized. Effector
      T(H)1 and T(H)2 cells are controlled by specialized subsets of regulatory T
      cells. Some pathogens can induce regulatory cells to evade immune elimination,
      but regulatory pathways are homeostatic and mainly triggered by harmless
      microorganisms. Helminths, saprophytic mycobacteria, bifidobacteria and
      lactobacilli, which induce immunoregulatory mechanisms in the host, ameliorate
      aberrant immune responses in the setting of allergy and inflammatory bowel
      disease. These organisms cause little, if any, harm, and have been part of human 
      microecology for millennia; however, they are now less frequent or even absent in
      the human environment of westernized societies. Deficient exposure to these 'old 
      friends' might explain the increase in immunodysregulatory disorders. The use of 
      probiotics, prebiotics, helminths or microbe-derived immunoregulatory vaccines
      might, therefore, become a valuable approach to disease prevention.

TI  - Recommendations for probiotic use.
PG  - 275-8
AB  - Probiotics are live microbial organisms that are administrated as supplements or 
      in foods to benefit the host. It is the recommendation that they may be helpful
      in the prevention and treatment of acute diarrhea in adults and children, the
      prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in adults and children, and the
      maintenance of remission and prevention of pouchitis. Although early results
      indicate that probiotics may also be useful in immunologic modulation to prevent 
      atopy, treatment of radiation intestinal disease, vaginosis, ulcerative colitis, 
      and the irritable bowel syndrome, the studies available are not sufficient to say
      they are definitely helpful. Even fewer data are available to recommend
      probiotics for the treatment of H pylori and Crohn disease and for the prevention
      of cardiovascular risk factors or other degenerative diseases. Clearly, larger
      and better-designed studies of probiotics are necessary, including comparative
      and dose-ranging trials.

TI  - Probiotics in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 260-3
AB  - The demonstration that immune and epithelial cells can discriminate between
      different microbial species has extended our understanding of the actions of
      probiotics beyond simple antimicrobial concepts. Several probiotic mechanisms of 
      action, relative to inflammatory bowel disease, have been elucidated: (1)
      competitive exclusion, whereby probiotics compete with microbial pathogens; (2)
      immunomodulation and/or stimulation of an immune response; (3) antimicrobial
      activity and suppression of pathogen growth; (4) enhancement of barrier activity;
      and (5) induction of T cell apoptosis. The unraveling of these mechanisms of
      action has led to new support for the use of probiotics in the management of
      clinical inflammatory bowel disease. While level 1 evidence now supports the
      therapeutic use of some probiotics in the maintenance treatment of pouchitis,
      only level 2 and 3 evidence are currently available in support of the use of
      probiotics in the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.
      Nevertheless, one significant and consistent finding has emerged over the course 
      of research in the past year: not all probiotic bacteria have similar therapeutic
      effects. Rigorously designed, controlled clinical trials, to investigate the
      unresolved issues related to efficacy, dose, duration of use, single or
      multistrain formulation, and the concomitant use of prebiotics, synbiotics or
      antibiotics, are vital.

TI  - Probiotics for children: use in diarrhea.
PG  - 244-8
AB  - The use of probiotics in diarrheal diseases of children is increasing.
      Probiotics, mostly lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria, 
      but also the yeast Saccharomyces boulardii, have been tried in many
      double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled studies, and several
      well-conducted meta-analyses are now available. There is some evidence of
      efficacy in the prevention of community-acquired and nosocomial diarrhea. More
      solid evidence of efficacy is found in the treatment of sporadic, infectious
      diarrhea, where several probiotics, and especially Lactobacillus GG, have been
      found capable of reducing by approximately 1 day the duration of diarrhea,
      shorten the initial phase of watery stools, and reducing hospital stay in
      developed countries. The effect is best documented in viral diarrheas. Although
      there are valid conceptual premises for probiotics to be helpful in inflammatory 
      bowel diseases, only 1 trial has been published in children, showing
      Lactobacillus GG not to be superior to placebo in maintaining remission of Crohn 
      disease. All considered, more research is needed for a better understanding of
      the role of probiotics in gastrointestinal diseases of children, addressing
      issues such as pharmacokinetics, mechanism of action, and role of specific
      probiotics, alone or in combination, in different disorders.

TI  - Altered levels of biochemical indices of bone turnover and bone-related vitamins 
      in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 1007-16
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease-associated osteopenia 
      may be related to pathological rates of bone turnover; however, the literature
      shows mixed results. AIM: To compare bone biomarkers in inflammatory bowel
      disease patients (Crohn's disease: n = 68, and ulcerative colitis: n = 32,
      separately) with age- and sex-matched healthy controls. SUBJECTS: Patients and
      controls were recruited from Cork University Hospital and Cork City area,
      respectively. RESULTS: Relative to that in their respective controls, Crohn's
      disease (n = 47) and ulcerative colitis (n = 26) patients (i.e. excluding
      supplement users) had significantly (P < 0.05-0.001) higher serum
      undercarboxylated osteocalcin (by 27% and 63%, respectively) and bone-specific
      alkaline phosphatase (by 15% and 21%, respectively) and urinary Type I collagen
      cross-linked N-telopeptides concentrations (by 87% and 112%, respectively).
      Relative to that in their respective controls, Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis patients had significantly (P < 0.01) lower serum total osteocalcin (by
      20% and 42%, respectively) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (by 37% and 42%,
      respectively), while serum parathyroid hormone levels were similar. In the
      combined patient group (n = 100), undercarboxylated osteocalcin was positively
      associated with bone markers. CONCLUSIONS: Both Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis patients have altered bone turnover relative to that in healthy controls.

TI  - Paneth cell defensins: key effector molecules of innate immunity.
PG  - 263-6
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are fundamental effector molecules of innate immunity,
      utilized in host defence by virtually all organisms studied. These gene-encoded
      peptides have direct antibiotic activity against a wide range of bacteria and
      other microbes. In humans and other mammals, defensins are a predominant class of
      such peptides. In the mammalian small intestine, Paneth cells, specialized
      secretory epithelial cells located at the base of the crypt invaginations lining 
      the intestinal wall, produce defensins and other antibiotic proteins. Recent
      investigations in murine models provide compelling support for the hypothesis
      that enteric defensins play a pivotal role in defence from food- and water-borne 
      pathogens in the intestinal lumen. Investigations by others indicate that
      intestinal commensal bacteria are key factors in the pathogenesis of IBD
      (inflammatory bowel disease) in genetically susceptible humans. Recent studies
      provide evidence that reduced expression of Paneth cell defensins may be a key
      factor in the pathogenesis of ileal Crohn's disease, a subgroup of IBD. Future
      studies to further define the function and regulation of Paneth cell defensins
      will enhance our understanding of normal small bowel physiology, and probably
      contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of inflammatory and
      infectious diseases of the bowel. Such knowledge may provide new therapeutic
      targets and strategies.

TI  - Nutritional deficiencies in patients with Crohn's disease in remission.
PG  - 185-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) are at risk of developing
      nutritional deficiencies, especially because of restrictive diets. The aim of our
      study was to assess food intake and the status for vitamins and trace elements in
      nonselected CD patients in clinical remission. METHODS: A total of 54 consecutive
      CD patients (28 females, 26 males, 39 +/- 2 years of age [mean +/- SD]) in
      clinical remission for >3 months underwent body composition, resting energy
      expenditure, nutrient intake, and plasma concentration assessment, and were
      compared with 25 healthy controls (16 females, 9 males, 38 +/- 3 years old).
      RESULTS: According to the nutritional risk index, 37 patients (70%) were not
      malnourished, 12 were at moderate risk, and 4 were at severe risk for
      malnutrition. Fat mass was lower in patients in remission compared with controls 
      (P = 0.04). The mean daily energy intake was comparable between patients (2218
      +/- 92 kcal/day) and controls (2066 +/- 101 kcal/day), covering their needs. No
      significant difference was observed for macronutrient intake in comparison with
      controls; compared to controls, female CD patients had lower intakes of
      beta-carotene (P < 0.005), vitamins B1 (P < 0.05), B6 (P < 0.01), and C (P <
      0.005), and magnesium (P < 0.01). They had significantly higher intakes of zinc
      (P < 0.01). Male CD patients had lower intakes of beta-carotene and vitamin C (P 
      < 0.05). More than 50% of patients had low plasma concentrations of vitamin C
      (84%), copper (84%), niacin (77%), and zinc (65%). CONCLUSIONS: In CD patients in
      remission, macronutrient needs are usually covered by food intake. However,
      micronutrient deficiencies are frequent and call for specific screening and
      treatment.

TI  - [Oxidative stress, prooxidants and Crohn disease].
PG  - 95-100
AB  - The frequency of Crohn disease shows a significant increase in the last century. 
      Affected patients show a misbalance between production of free radicals and anti 
      oxidant defenses. Thus, one of the increasingly accepted htypotheses to explain
      the origin of this disease, is the oxidative stress that occurs in the intestinal
      mucosa. Dietary factors including self administered vitamin and mineral
      supplements may play a role, especially when they contain excessive amounts of
      iron and copper, known for their prooxidant capacities. Unfortunately, little is 
      known about how these metals may influence the antioxidant defenses in the
      intestinal mucosa. This article reviews the literature on the why and how these
      elements may act on individuals susceptible to develop Crohn disease, including
      the evidence supporting the hypothesis that oxidative stress in the intestinal
      mucosa is an important pathogenetic factor.

      percent of Irish CD patients were vitamin D deficient (defined by serum 25
      hydroxyvitamin (OH) D levels <50 nmol/l) during winter and summer, respectively. 
      Multiple regression analysis showed that summer-time serum 25 (OH) D levels were 
      positively associated with use of vitamin D supplements (P=0.033) and negatively 
      associated with smoking (P=0.006) and being male (P=0.063). During winter-time,
      use of vitamin D supplements (P=0.041) and sun habits (P=0.066) were positively
      associated, whereas small intestinal involvement (P=0.005) and body mass index
      (BMI) (P=0.083) were negatively associated with serum 25 (OH) D levels. There was
      no significant association between other non-pathophysiologic (age, dietary
      calcium or vitamin D) or pathophysiologic factors (steroid use, resection), and
      serum 25 (OH) D levels, at either season. Approximately 41 and 60% of the total
      variation in summer- and winter-time serum 25 (OH) D, respectively, was explained
      by this model. CONCLUSION: A high proportion of Irish CD patents had some level
      of vitamin D deficiency (<50 nmol/l) during late-wintertime. Use of regular
      low-dose supplemental vitamin D, particularly by patients with small intestinal
      involvement, cessation of smoking and adequate, but responsible, exposure to
      summer sunlight as well as maintaining BMI in the normal range could help
      maintain adequate vitamin D levels during wintertime.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Involvement of the skin in Crohn's disease is rare. We report the
      case of a young woman presenting cutaneous nodules revealing a Crohn's disease.
      CASE REPORT: R. K. a 19 year old woman was admitted the impatient clinic for a 2 
      week history of nodular lesions of the extremities. Simultaneously, she had
      watery diarrhoea and abdominal pain associated with a bad general condition and
      fever. Skin examination showed ulcerated lesions with a non infiltrated
      inflammatory bader of the left food and the right calf associated with an abscess
      of the left forearm. Skin biopsy showed an inflammatory infiltrate of the deep
      dermis with tuberculoid noncaseating granulomas. Colonoscopy demonstrated
      multiple ulcers, a "globlestone appearance" of the glow and segmental glitis.
      Colonoscopy was followed by a peritonitis which made steroid therapy
      questionable. Meanwhile, the patient underwent a colonostomy and was fed
      intravenously, the skin lesions resolved. A follow up colonoscopy demonstrated
      colon polyps, and the biopsy of the colon showed features of colitis and
      "follicular" duodenitis which was in concordance with the diagnosis of Crohn's
      disease. COMMENTARIES: Usually, cutaneous lesions in Crohn's disease are
      consistent with nodules and granulomatous fissures of the grain. Involvement of
      the mucosa is rare. We report the case of "metastatic" localisation of nodular
      abscesses in Corhn disease. Improvement of cutaneous lesions might be explained
      by the nonuse of the digestive track allowed by the parenteral supplementation.

TI  - Acute duodenal Crohn's disease successfully managed with low-speed elemental diet
      infusion via nasogastric tube: a case report.
PG  - 649-51
AB  - Duodenal Crohn's disease is rare, and patients without obstruction are treated
      medically. We herein report one case whose duodenal Crohn's disease was
      successfully managed with low-speed elemental diet infusion through a nasogastric
      tube. A 28-year-old female developed acute duodenal Crohn's disease. Upper GI
      radiologic and endoscopic examinations showed a stricture in the duodenal bulb.
      Using the duodenal biopsy specimens, mucosal cytokine levels were measured;
      interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels were
      remarkably elevated. For initial 2 wk, powdered mesalazine was orally given but
      it was not effective. For the next 2 wk, she was treated with low-speed elemental
      diet therapy using a commercially available Elental(TM), which was infused
      continuously through a nasogastric tube using an infusion pump. The tip of the
      nasogastric tube was placed at an immediate oral side of the pylorus. The
      infusion speed was 10 mL/h (usual speed, 100 mL/h). After the 2-wk treatment, her
      symptoms were very much improved, and endoscopically, the duodenal stricture and 
      inflammation improved. The duodenal mucosal cytokine levels remarkably decreased 
      compared with those before the treatment. Although our experience was limited,
      low-speed elemental diet infusion through a nasogastric tube may be a useful
      treatment for acute duodenal Crohn's disease.

TI  - Effect of fish oil enriched enteral diet on inflammatory bowel disease tissues in
      organ culture: differential effects on ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.
PG  - 7466-72
AB  - AIM: To investigate the influence of fish oil enriched enteral diet on intestinal
      tissues taken from Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and non-inflamed
      non-IBD control patients in vitro. METHODS: Colonoscopic biopsies from patients
      with active CD (n = 4), active UC (n = 7), and non-inflamed non-IBD control
      patients (n = 4) were incubated (three dilutions of 1:20, 1:10, and 1:5) with
      Waymouth's culture medium and enteral elemental diet (EO28, SHS, Liverpool, UK)
      modified in the fatty acid composition with fish oil (EF) in an organ culture
      system for 24 h. In each experimental set-up, incubation with Waymouth's medium
      alone as control was included. Tissue viability was assessed by adding
      bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) to the culture fluid and immunohistochemically staining 
      for BrdU uptake. Cytokine ratio of IL-1ra/IL-1beta (low ratio indicative of
      inflammation) and production of those cytokines as a percentage of medium control
      were assayed in the culture supernatant. RESULTS: Incubation of CD-affected
      tissue with EF (1:20, 1:10, and 1:5) modestly and non-significantly increased
      IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio as compared with medium control (CD 39.1+/-16.1;
      26.5+/-7.8, 47.1+/-16.8 vs control 13.0+/-2.2), but incubation of UC-affected
      tissues increased IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio significantly in all three dilutions (UC 
      69.1+/-32.2, P<0.05; 76.1+/-36.4, P = 0.05; 84.5+/-37.3, P<0.02; vs control
      10.2+/-3.7). Incubation of non-inflamed non-IBD control tissue did not increase
      the IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio in any dilution compared to medium control
      (69.3+/-47.0, 54.1+/-30.6, 79.4+/-34.0 vs control 76.1+/-37.3). Average
      percentage production of IL-1beta indexed against medium control was
      significantly less in UC after EF incubation as compared with CD (UC 24.0+/-4.8
      vs CD 51.8+/-8.1; P<0.05). Average percentage production of IL-1ra was markedly
      higher in UC (135.9+/-3.4) than that in control patients (36.5+/-4.3) (P<0.0001).
      CONCLUSION: IBD tissues, after incubation with elemental diet modified in its
      fatty acid composition with fish oil, show an increase in IL-1ra/IL-1beta
      cytokine ratio. This effect of omega-3 fatty acid modulation is significantly
      more marked in UC compared with CD and is accompanied by both a reduction of
      IL-1beta and increase of IL-1ra. The positive direct anti-inflammatory effect of 
      elemental diet with fish oil in tissue affected with UC suggests dietary
      treatment of UC may be possible.

TI  - Crohn's disease leading to bowel cancer may be avoided by consumption of soya
      isoflavones: adjunct-chemotherapy with oxaliplatin.
PG  - 934-5
AB  - Crohn's disease (inflammatory bowel syndrome) is caused by gut exposure to
      harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived from oxygen, such as the superoxide
      anion ((.)O(2)'), the hydroxyl radical ((.)OH) or the peroxide anion (O(2)''):
      the superoxide anion is generated by breakdown of oxygen-peroxidised
      phospholipids membranes. Crohn's disease predisposes to bowel cancer in
      susceptible human sub-populations. It may be preventable in these as yet
      unpredictable sub-populations by dietary-based intervention strategies, such as
      the daily consumption of appropriate quantities of soya isoflavones. These
      isoflavonoids are ROS-directed antioxidants, and they include the phytoestrogens,
      daidzin and genistin present in soya foods (consumed also in dietary
      supplements). Oxaliplatin is a platinum-containing Pt(II) organometallic
      therapeutic agent that binds to tumour DNA. Oxaliplatin may provide, therefore, a
      form of chemotherapy for some bowel cancers especially when administered in
      adjunct-chemotherapies that employ inhibitors of proliferation of the tumour
      cell. Such inhibitors include 5-fluorouracil, which prevents the correct
      replication of tumour cell DNA that is an essential prerequisite for bowel tumour
      growth. Furthermore, the therapeutic index for adjunct-chemotherapy with toxic
      inhibitors of DNA replication and expression could potentially be raised
      significantly by an associated dietary regime. This should include
      supplementation daily, per or, with antioxidant isoflavones (or other
      bioflavonoids) in selected cases of unresponsive cancer of the bowel, to possibly
      seek to trigger the pathway of apoptosis (programmed cell death) in the tumour
      cells preferentially.

TI  - Most probable origin of coeliac disease is low immune globulin A in the intestine
      caused by malfunction of Peyer's patches.
PG  - 757-62
AB  - Coeliac disease frequency increases by obscure reasons and affects in some
      Western countries as much as 1% of the populations. The second one of monozygotic
      twins does not develop the disease in 100% but only in 20-50%. To unravel these
      mysteries, literature was searched to determine the disease background and find
      suggestions for research and prevention. The causal antigen of coeliac disease is
      gluten of wheat that is neutralised in the intestine by secretory immune globulin
      A (sIgA). SIgA is secreted by the secondary (lymphoid) immune system that
      develops in a newborn infant after the primary (central) immune organs thymus and
      bone marrow have been primed with antigens of the intestine. Predisposed infants 
      are sensitive for development of coeliac disease during the time without sIgA
      secretion into the intestine. The risk of the disease diminishes when sIgA cycles
      of gluten neutralisation develop. Peyer's patches (PP) of the secondary immune
      system play a central role in the cycles and possibly do not function well in the
      case of coeliac disease. Coeliac disease in predisposed infants may be prevented 
      by delay of bread consumption till the time of normal sIgA secretion and by
      application of a challenge period with gluten (see Discussion). It is concluded
      that sIgA secretion into body cavities and malfunction of immune cells in PP
      should be included in the future research of coeliac disease as well as in more
      allergic diseases (type 1 diabetes, Crohn disease, asthma, hay fever).

TI  - Combined use of noninvasive tests is useful in the initial diagnostic approach to
      a child with suspected inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 9-15
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of the combined use of fecal calprotectin 
      (FC), anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA), perinuclear staining
      antineutrophil antibody (pANCA), small intestinal permeability test (IP), and
      bowel wall ultrasonography measurement (BWUS) in the diagnostic work-up of
      children with suspected inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: All children
      referred for initial assessment of possible IBD were eligible. Patients with
      symptoms or signs (right-lower quadrant mass, perianal disease, or hematochezia) 
      mandating a complete work-up for IBD were excluded. All enrolled patients
      underwent a clinical, laboratory, radiographic, and endoscopic evaluation
      including biopsy examinations. The immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgA ASCA, IgG pANCA, 
      FC, IP, and BWUS were tested in all patients at the initial assessment. RESULTS: 
      A final diagnosis of IBD was made in 27 patients: 17 Crohn disease and 10
      ulcerative colitis. Eighteen children had other gastrointestinal diagnoses (8
      functional bowel disorders, 5 food allergy-mediated diseases, 4 infectious
      enterocolitis, 1 familial Mediterranean fever). In patients with simultaneous
      abnormal values of FC, BWUS, and ASCA/pANCA, the estimated probability of having 
      IBD was 99.47%. Patients with negative results on all tests had a 0.69% of
      probability of IBD. CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of noninvasive diagnostic
      tests into the initial diagnostic approach may avoid unnecessary invasive
      procedures and facilitate clinical decision-making when the diagnosis of IBD in
      children is initially uncertain.

TI  - Ineffectiveness of Lactobacillus johnsonii LA1 for prophylaxis of postoperative
      recurrence in Crohn's disease: a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled
      GETAID trial.
PG  - 842-7
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Early endoscopic recurrence is frequent after intestinal
      resection for Crohn's disease. Bacteria are involved, and probiotics may modulate
      immune responses to the intestinal flora. Here we tested the probiotic strain
      Lactobacillus johnsonii LA1 in this setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a
      randomised, double blind, placebo controlled study. Patients were eligible if
      they had undergone surgical resection of <1 m, removing all macroscopic lesions
      within the past 21 days. Patients were randomised to receive two packets per day 
      of lyophilised LA1 (2 x 10(9) cfu) or placebo for six months; no other treatment 
      was allowed. The primary endpoint was endoscopic recurrence at six months, with
      grade >1 in Rutgeerts' classification or an adapted classification for colonic
      lesions. Endoscopic score was the maximal grade of ileal and colonic lesions.
      Analyses were performed primarily on an intent to treat basis. RESULTS: Ninety
      eight patients were enrolled (48 in the LA1 group). At six months, endoscopic
      recurrence was observed in 30/47 patients (64%) in the placebo group and in 21/43
      (49%) in the LA1 group (p = 0.15). Per protocol analysis confirmed this result.
      Endoscopic score distribution did not differ significantly between the LA1 and
      placebo groups. There were four clinical recurrences in the LA1 group and three
      in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: L johnsonii LA1 (4 x 10(9) cfu/day) did not
      have a sufficient effect, if any, to prevent endoscopic recurrence of Crohn's
      disease.

TI  - Complications of biological therapy for inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 30-43
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to analyze the complications
      associated with treatment of inflammatory bowel disease with biologic agents.
      RECENT FINDINGS: There have been various biologic agents evaluated in patients
      with inflammatory bowel disease; that is, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.
      Thus far only infliximab has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration
      as induction and maintenance treatment in patients with active Crohn's disease
      (moderate-to-severe and/or fistulizing) who are refractory to conventional
      therapy. Recent data from two large multicenter, multicountry, randomized
      controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that infliximab is efficacious also 
      for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Other biologics considered potentially
      efficacious are still undergoing evaluation in various clinical trials. SUMMARY: 
      The data concerning biologics' associated toxicity in patients with inflammatory 
      bowel disease are the most robust in the case of infliximab. These data are
      derived from both prospective, randomized clinical trials and from post-marketing
      experience. In the case of the remaining agents the data concerning safety in
      inflammatory bowel disease are limited, as these agents were not evaluated in as 
      many trials as infliximab; indeed, some of them included only several patients.

TI  - Positioning novel biologic, probiotic, and apheresis therapies for Crohn's
      disease and ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 485-91
AB  - Traditional medications for inflammatory bowel disease are small molecule drugs, 
      most of which were developed for use in other diseases before being found to be
      efficacious for the treatment of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. Recently,
      several exciting alternative approaches to the medical treatment of inflammatory 
      bowel disease have been developed. These include biologic, probiotic, and
      apheresis therapies that offer certain advantages over traditional drug therapy
      for inflammatory bowel disease. The purpose of this review is to assess the
      current state of knowledge about novel biologic, probiotic, and apheresis
      therapies and to analyze how best to incorporate these therapies into evolving
      management paradigms of inflammatory bowel disease.

PG  - 475-84
AB  - Advances (from 2004 to 2006) in the use of conventional agents include the
      molecular mechanisms of action, which have implications for monitoring
      (azathioprine and thioguanosine triphosphate) and chemoprevention (mesalamine and
      peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma). Advances in biotherapy include
      new data on monoclonal antibodies (infliximab in ulcerative colitis, adalimumab, 
      certolizumab pegol, fontolizumab, selective anti-adhesion molecules, and others),
      antisense oligonucleotides, the development of small molecules, and cell-gene
      therapy (including helminth ova, leukocytapheresis, stem cell transplantation,
      and probiotic intestinal mucosal delivery systems). However, management of
      inflammatory bowel disease is about more than drug therapy, dose, and timing. The
      goals remain induction of remission, limitation of side effects, modification of 
      the pattern of disease, and avoidance of complications. With the cost and
      complexity of biotherapy, inflammatory bowel disease is emerging as a specific
      subspecialty.

TI  - Short- and long-term therapeutic efficacy of nutritional therapy and
      corticosteroids in paediatric Crohn's disease.
PG  - 381-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Comparative data on the therapeutic efficacy of different enteral
      nutrition formulas and corticosteroids to obtain clinical remission and to induce
      mucosal healing influencing long-term disease course in paediatric Crohn's
      disease are still scarce. AIMS: To investigate the efficacy of nutritional
      therapy using three different formulas versus corticosteroids to achieve clinical
      remission as well as to induce intestinal mucosal healing in active Crohn's
      disease children. Duration of remission and effect on growth recovery were also
      assessed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical, laboratory, endoscopic and histological
      data of all new diagnosed active Crohn's disease paediatric cases were
      retrospectively recorded and reviewed. Thirty-seven children (median age 12.1
      years) received nutritional therapy (12 polymeric; 13 semi-elemental; 12
      elemental diet) and 10 subjects (median age 12.4 years) received corticosteroids.
      RESULTS: Similar clinical remission rate were observed after 8 weeks of
      treatment: 86.5% children receiving nutritional therapy versus 90% treated with
      corticosteroids. Improvement in mucosal inflammation occurred in 26 out of 37
      (64.8%) patients on nutritional therapy and in 4 out of 10 (40%) children on
      steroids (p < 0.05). Finally, seven subjects on nutritional therapy and none on
      corticosteroids achieved complete mucosal healing (p < 0.005) at the end of the
      treatment. Nutritional therapy was more effective than corticosteroids in
      improving nutritional status and linear growth recovery. Compared to
      corticosteroids, the duration of clinical remission was longer in the nutritional
      therapy groups without differences among the three different formulas.
      CONCLUSIONS: In children with active Crohn's disease, nutritional therapy is more
      effective than corticosteroids to improve intestinal inflammation and to maintain
      a more sustained clinical remission.

TI  - Significance of salicylate intolerance in diseases of the lower gastrointestinal 
      tract.
PG  - 89-102
AB  - Salicylate intolerance is defined as a nonspecific antigen-induced
      pseudo-allergic hypersensitivity reaction which can occur upon contact of an
      organism with salicylic acid, its derivatives or other related organic or
      inorganic acids of similar chemical structure. Since the effects of nonsteroidal 
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) intolerance are by no means always severe or
      life-endangering but may just as well present as oligosymptomatic or local
      disorders (e.g. abdominal pain, diarrhea, we decided to evaluate the
      characteristics of patients with salicylate intolerance on the basis of
      gastroenterological case material of Medical Department I of Erlangen University.
      On the basis of the findings from the Erlangen interdisciplinary data register of
      chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal disease, the signs and symptoms of NSAID
      intolerance were found to constitute a diagnosis of great practical import to
      clinical medicine (allergology, dermatology, immunology, other disorders etc.)
      including gastroenterology. For approx. 2-7% of all patients with inflammatory
      bowel syndrome and food allergies this poses a new diagnostic and therapeutic
      challenge which may concern physicians from any of the disciplines involved. When
      presented with patients with chronic active disease who are suffering from these 
      symptoms one should, therefore, in future give greater thought to the possibility
      of salicylate intolerance, all the more as there are meaningful dietetic,
      diagnostic and therapeutic options available for these persons.

TI  - Curcumin therapy in inflammatory bowel disease: a pilot study.
PG  - 2191-3
AB  - Curcumin, a natural compound used as a food additive, has been shown to have
      anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in cell culture and animal studies. 
      A pure curcumin preparation was administered in an open label study to five
      patients with ulcerative proctitis and five with Crohn's disease. All proctitis
      patients improved, with reductions in concomitant medications in four, and four
      of five Crohn's disease patients had lowered CDAI scores and sedimentation rates.
      This encouraging pilot study suggests the need for double-blind
      placebo-controlled follow-up studies.

TI  - [From farm to fork--Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (MAP) as zoonotic
      agent?].
PG  - 377-85
AB  - Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is the causative agent of the
      paratuberculosis (Para Tb) in ruminants. In addition, this pathogen has been
      suspected to be implicated in the pathogenesis of Morbus Crohn disease (MC),
      causing chronic inflammatory intestine changes of humans. The participation of
      MAP in this illness is discussed intensively and has very contradictory opinions.
      On the one hand several times succeeded in proving MAP DNA in changed human
      tissues as well as, in recent time, the bacteria has been isolated from patient's
      blood. On the other hand there are many publications which support the opposite
      opinion. In critical evaluation of already available data, therefore the
      hypothesis can be formulated that MAP could possibly take part in the MC of
      humans. The reliable verification of this hypothesis will only be possible, if
      the diagnostic procedures can be refined upon the substantial deficit concerning 
      the sensitivity and/or specificity of the diagnostic methods. In addition, till
      now there is lack of optimized statistically case control studies. The
      conceivable transmission of the bacteria to humans by the direct animal contact
      has been considered as possible vector, furthermore, MAP has been detected in
      pasteurised milk and other food of animal origin. The prevalence data, usually
      estimated by ELISA for milk cattle stock show over 80% prevalence in many
      counties of the Federal Republic of Germany with an individual case prevalence
      ranging between 1% and 17% in different stocks. Comparable data are present also 
      from other countries as well as for small ruminants. MAP has been concerned as a 
      global problem, moreover the high spreading rate of MAP in wild animal
      populations as well as the considerable ability of the bacteria to survive in
      different stages of the infectious- and contamination-cycle, which might hardly
      be broken through. Thus it requires intensive research efforts for the
      development of the methodical diagnostic process as basis for valid
      epidemiological investigations of animals, humans and food.

TI  - Probiotics (VSL#3) in arthralgia in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's 
      disease: a pilot study.
PG  - 453-9
AB  - Arthralgia is a common extraintestinal manifestation of inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). Alterations of the immunologic regulation in the gut may
      contribute to the pathogenesis of arthralgia. Probiotics (VSL#3) have proven
      effective in the treatment of pouchitis in patients with ileal pouch anal
      anastomosis after panproctocolectomy for ulcerative colitis both in maintaining
      remission and in preventing a flare-up without side effects. The aim of this
      study was to determine the safety and efficacy of VSL#3 in patients with
      quiescent IBD who suffered from arthralgia for more than two weeks. An open-label
      trial was conducted using VSL#3. Pre- and post-treatment joint pain intensity
      were measured on the Ritchie Articular Index and visual analog scale. Disease
      activity of the bowel was assessed by the Truelove-Witts and the Harvey-Bradshaw 
      scores. Sixteen of 29 patients completed the trial; in 10 of the 16 patients a
      statistically significant improvement was documented by the Ritchie Articular
      Index. No one of the patients had a relapse of intestinal disease while on
      probiotics. These preliminary results suggest that the probiotic mixture VSL#3
      may be an alternative treatment for arthralgia in patients with IBD without
      inducing exacerbation of the disease. Because probiotics may be effective in the 
      treatment of IBD as well, our results suggest that patients with active disease
      and arthralgia may also derive benefit from this treatment. Proper randomized
      controlled studies are indicated.

TI  - Treatment of active Crohn's disease in children using partial enteral nutrition
      with liquid formula: a randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 356-61
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Total enteral nutrition (TEN) with a liquid formula can
      suppress gut inflammation and induce remission in active Crohn's disease. The
      mechanism is obscure. Studies have suggested that long term nutritional
      supplementation with a liquid formula (partial enteral nutrition (PEN)) may also 
      suppress inflammation and prevent relapse. The aim of this study was to compare
      PEN with conventional TEN in active Crohn's disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty 
      children with a paediatric Crohn's disease activity index (PCDAI)>20 were
      randomly assigned to receive 50% (PEN) or 100% (TEN) of their energy requirement 
      as elemental formula for six weeks. The PEN group was encouraged to eat an
      unrestricted diet while those receiving TEN were not allowed to eat. The primary 
      outcome was achievement of remission (PCDAI<10). Secondary analyses of changes in
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C reactive protein, albumin, and platelets 
      were performed to look for evidence of anti-inflammatory effects. RESULTS:
      Remission rate with PEN was lower than with TEN (15% v 42%; p=0.035). Although
      PCDAI fell in both groups (p=0.001 for both), the reduction was greater with TEN 
      (p=0.005). Moreover, the fall in PCDAI with PEN was due to symptomatic and
      nutritional benefits. With both treatments there were significant improvements in
      relation to abdominal pain, "sense of wellbeing", and nutritional status.
      However, only TEN led to a reduction in diarrhoea (p=0.02), an increase in
      haemoglobin and albumin, and a fall in platelets and ESR. CONCLUSIONS: TEN
      suppresses inflammation in active Crohn's disease but PEN does not. This suggests
      that long term nutritional supplementation, although beneficial to some patients,
      is unlikely to suppress inflammation and so prevent disease relapse.

TI  - The use of medications for inflammatory bowel disease during pregnancy and
      nursing.
PG  - 1833-9
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease includes two primary disorders, ulcerative colitis and
      Crohn's disease. These diseases mainly affect young adults, with a peak
      occurrence between 15 and 25 years of age. The causes of these diseases are
      largely unknown, with current treatments targeted against the heightened
      inflammatory response witnessed in the intestinal mucosa of both conditions. With
      the peak age ranges for pregnancy and inflammatory bowel disease overlapping, it 
      is important to weigh the benefits of treating a mother during pregnancy against 
      the potential risks to the fetus and the course of the pregnancy. This review
      examines the current safety data on medications used in women with inflammatory
      bowel disease during pregnancy.

TI  - A randomized, double-blind trial of Lactobacillus GG versus placebo in addition

PG  - 833-9
AB  - Probiotics are widely used by patients with Crohn's disease (CD) in an attempt to
      improve their health, but few controlled studies have been done to evaluate the
      efficacy of these therapies. We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial 
      of the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG (LGG) to see if the addition
      of LGG to standard therapy prolonged remission in children with CD. Concomitant
      medications allowed in the study included aminosalicylates, 6-mercaptopurine,
      azathioprine, and low-dose alternate day corticosteroids. Seventy-five children
      (age range, 5-21 yr) with CD in remission were randomized to either LGG (n=39) or
      placebo (n=36) and followed for up to 2 years. The median time to relapse was 9.8
      months in the LGG group and 11.0 months in the placebo group (P=0.24); 31%
      (12/39) of patients in the LGG group developed a relapse compared with 6/36 (17%)
      of the placebo group (P=0.18). The LGG was well tolerated, with a side effect
      profile comparable with placebo. This study suggests that LGG does not prolong
      time to relapse in children with CD when given as an adjunct to standard therapy.

TI  - High-dose fish oil and antioxidants in Crohn's disease and the response of bone
      turnover: a randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 253-61
AB  - Crohn's disease is associated with altered bone turnover that may be influenced
      by nutritional status, the systemic inflammatory response, cytokine production by
      circulating (peripheral blood) mononuclear cells (PBMC) and antioxidant
      micronutrient intake. High-dose fish oil is associated with reductions in disease
      relapse and inflammatory markers, and modulates PBMC function. The effect of fish
      oil plus antioxidants on bone turnover and PBMC function (the production of
      interferon-gamma and prostaglandin E2) in Crohn's disease was investigated in a
      randomised-controlled trial. Patients with currently or recently raised
      biochemical markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein > or = 6.9 mg/l or
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate > or =18 mm/h) received fish oil (providing 2.7
      g/d EPA and DHA) and antioxidants (vitamins A, C and E, and Se) (n 31) or placebo
      (n 30) for 24 weeks. Bone turnover was assessed by measuring the concentrations
      of urinary deoxypyridinoline (bone resorption) and serum osteocalcin (bone
      formation). Fish oil plus antioxidants were associated with increases in EPA, DHA
      Se in plasma (all P < 0.01), and with a reduction in interferon-gamma production 
      by mitogen-stimulated PBMC, which demonstrated a negative correlation with
      deoxypyridinoline/creatinine:osteocalcin ratio (r - 0.33, P = 0.009). There were 
      no differences between the groups at 24 weeks in the response of
      deoxypyridinoline or osteocalcin or their ratio, or in nutritional status.
      Dietary supplementation in Crohn's disease with high intakes of EPA and DHA, as
      fish oil, plus antioxidants was associated with a modulated production of
      interferon-gamma by PBMC but not altered indices of bone turnover.

TI  - Crohn's disease: the cold chain hypothesis.
PG  - 399-401
AB  - A recent published hypothesis proposed that Crohn's disease was provoked by
      infantile exposure to micro-organisms that can survive refrigerator temperature. 
      A case-control study was accordingly devised. The mean age at first fridge was
      5.6 years amongst 88 patients with Crohn's disease, 5.5 years in 88 patients with
      ulcerative colitis (UC) and 7.6 years in 88 controls, but a majority of
      individuals had always been exposed to refrigerated food. Differences were more
      striking in subjects aged above the median (10.3, 10.9 and 15.0 years for Crohn's
      disease, UC and controls, respectively). This support for the hypothesis reached 
      statistical significance for those with Crohn's disease compared to the controls 
      (p=0.045).

TI  - [Nutritional treatment in childhood Crohn's disease].
PG  - 1255-66
AB  - Growth retardation and delay in sexual maturation are the major complications of 
      child-onset Crohn's disease (CD). Nutritional assessment and monitoring should
      comprise: weight and height measurement with calculation of respective velocities
      (growth velocity should be > or = 4-5 cm/year during the prepubertal period);
      pubertal staging; dietetic evaluation; laboratory analysis for mineral, vitamin
      and trace element deficiencies; bone age. At diagnosis, weight loss and growth
      delay are present in 80-90% and 1/3 of cases, respectively. In case of an acute
      flare-up in a CD child with normal nutritional status, nutritional therapy is
      limited to oral feeding, with a caloric intake at least equal to recommended
      dietary allowances for age and sex. A low-fiber diet is advised in case of small 
      bowel stenosis. No diet has been shown as efficient in the long-term maintenance 
      of remission. Exclusive enteral nutrition (EN) is an alternative to
      corticosteroids for the treatment of an acute flare-up of CD, especially in case 
      of malnutrition. Prolonged nocturnal EN is of great interest for the treatment of
      growth retardation and delay of sexual maturation and in case of
      steroid-dependent or steroid-refractory CD. In case of steroid-dependent CD with 
      no delay of growth and/or sexual maturation, immunomodulating agents are nowadays
      an alternative to long-term EN. Efficacy of polymeric solutions is identical to
      that of semi-elemental or elemental solutions. Parenteral nutrition is limited to
      an acute flare-up with resistance to medical treatment and/or EN, and
      contraindications to surgery; occlusion or fistula; short bowel syndrome.

TI  - Postoperative Crohn's disease.
PG  - 765-77
AB  - More than three quarters of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) will require
      surgery. After resection, disease recurs postoperatively with a median time to
      second resection of about 10 years. Despite its importance, the postoperative
      period remains one of the most poorly understood clinical settings in the field. 
      Postoperatively, CD may exhibit unique pathophysiologic features, but the current
      state of knowledge does not allow for identification of patients at risk for
      relapse, and leaves clinicians without guidance on optimal maintenance treatment.
      Therapies used as maintenance for CD in other settings may have different
      efficacies when used after surgery, and clinical research in patients requiring
      surgery is limited by the subset of patients available for study. Despite the
      many limitations in current knowledge of postoperative CD, it is an exciting
      field because new developments have improved patient care, and ongoing research
      has the potential for further gains.

TI  - Etiology of Crohn's disease: Do certain food additives cause intestinal
      inflammation by molecular mimicry of mycobacterial lipids?
PG  - 859-64
AB  - Crohn's disease is a chronic granulomatous inflammation of the gastrointestinal
      tract which was first described in the beginning of the 20th century. The
      histological similarity with intestinal tuberculosis has led to the assumption of
      an involvement of mycobacteria and mycobacterial antigens, respectively, in the
      etiology. A major defense mechanism against mycobacterial lipid antigens is the
      CD1 system which includes CD1 molecules for antigen presentation and natural
      killer T cells for recognition and subsequent production of cytokines like
      interferon-gamma and tumour necrosis factor-alpha. These cytokines promote
      granulomatous transformation. Various food additives, especially emulsifiants,
      thickeners, surface-finishing agents and contaminants like plasticizers share
      structural domains with mycobacterial lipids. It is therefore hypothesized, that 
      these compounds are able to stimulate by molecular mimicry the CD1 system in the 
      gastrointestinal mucosa and to trigger the pro-inflammatory cytokine cascade. The
      understanding of Crohn's disease as a CD1-mediated delayed-type hypersensitivity 
      to certain food additives would lead to strong emphasis on a dietary treatment.
      Related aspects of pathology, physiology and epidemiology of Crohn's disease are 
      presented.

PG  - 318-25
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review reports on the recent progress understanding
      mechanisms of action and clinical applications of probiotics. RECENT FINDINGS:
      New insights on regulating mechanisms of intestinal commensal bacteria to prevent
      and treat different gastrointestinal diseases have been reported. Some
      probiotics, though not all, exert beneficial effects by modulating the mucosal
      barrier function and immune activity. It seems that a combination of different
      probiotics is more effective than a single strain. It was demonstrated that not
      only viable bacteria administered to the intestinal tract but also isolated
      probiotic DNA is active, even if injected subcutaneously. There is reasonable
      evidence to recommend probiotics in infectious diarrhoea for prevention and
      treatment (mainly in children) and to prevent antibiotic-induced gastrointestinal
      side effects. Furthermore, probiotics are effective in maintaining remission in
      ulcerative colitis and preventing and treating pouchitis. Promising positive
      effects were published in major surgery patients (gastric resection, pancreatic
      resection, liver transplantation) and in severe necrotising acute pancreatitis.
      SUMMARY: Increasing knowledge on probiotics is exciting, but in the near future
      it must be defined which probiotics (single strains or a combination) are most
      effective in specific diseases. Well-designed, randomized clinical trials are
      still required to further define the role of probiotics as preventive and
      therapeutic agents.

TI  - Enteral nutrition and microflora in pediatric Crohn's disease.
PG  - S173-5; discussion S175-8, S184-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EN) is an established primary therapy
      for pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). The mechanism of action of such treatment is 
      still conjectural. The aim of the present study was to investigate if EN-induced 
      remission is associated with modification of the fecal microflora in CD. METHODS:
      Stool samples were collected from 5 healthy children and adolescents over a
      period of 3 months, and from 9 children and adolescents with active CD. To induce
      disease remission, children with CD received a course of exclusive EN for 8 weeks
      with a polymeric formula (Modulen IBD, Nestle). At the end of the course of
      exclusive EN, children returned to a free diet but continued to take 40% of the
      daily caloric intake as polymeric formula. Fecal microflora was analyzed by 16S
      ribosomal DNA polymerase chain reaction and temperature gradient gel
      electrophoresis (TGGE) with direct visual comparison of band profiles of PCR
      products. RESULTS: In 8 of 9 children, the exclusive EN alone induced disease
      remission. In 1 child, it was necessary to add steroids to the exclusive EN
      course to achieve remission. In all children with CD, analysis of gel band
      distribution revealed profound modification of the fecal microflora after
      exclusive EN. Variations of band distribution corresponding to different
      bacterial species were observed also in children on partial EN and required time 
      to achieve stability of the band profile. In contrast, control healthy children
      showed a host-specific and stable TGGE profile over time. CONCLUSION: These data 
      suggest that a possible mechanism of action of EN in inducing disease remission
      in CD is the capacity of modification of gut microflora. Possible explanations of
      such capacity are both low residue and prebiotic properties of the polymeric
      liquid formula.

PG  - S166-9; discussion S169-72, S184-8
AB  - Crohn's disease is a chronic, relapsing disease and none of the treatments
      developed so far can cure it. Artificial nutrition is effective to both treat
      malnutrition when present and induce remission. However, striking advances in
      anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating therapies (including infliximab) and low
      compliance to treatment in the first trials have limited its place in the
      management of adults to drug-resistant patients. Randomized controlled trials
      show that artificial nutrition is effective in >50% of the cases in this selected
      population. Significant progress has recently been made to improve the
      palatability (and thus acceptability) of some enteral solutions, which can be
      consumed by the oral route and as pharmaconutrition. We reviewed the literature
      on enteral nutrition in adults with Crohn's disease. We present herein the
      results of the studies performed with antioxidants, glutamine, short-chain fatty 
      acids, prebiotics, probiotics, low microparticle diets, and a TGFbeta2 enriched
      formulation.

PG  - S108-12; discussion S112-7, S184-8
AB  - Exclusive feeding of defined formula diets has been used successfully as an
      alternative to corticosteroid treatment of active Crohn's disease, but the
      mechanism of efficacy remains conjectural. Recognition that polymorphisms in the 
      NOD2/CARD15 gene confer susceptibility to Crohn's disease has increased
      appreciation of the interactions between the innate immune system and enteric
      bacteria, which lead to chronic intestinal inflammation. The 2 major goals of
      this workshop are: first, in light of current understanding of pathogenesis, to
      examine possible mechanisms of action of enteral nutrition as primary therapy;
      and second, to make evidence-based recommendations concerning its use in the new 
      era of biologic therapies, when mucosal healing has become a realistic goal.
      Factors influencing efficacy, including duration, location of intestinal
      inflammation, and formula composition require consideration.

TI  - Human defensins in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 42-54
AB  - Crohn's disease, a transmural inflammation of the gut, has been linked to good
      childhood hygiene, frequent use of antibiotics before diagnosis, adherent or
      invasive mucosal bacteria and a break in the tolerance of luminal bacteria. A
      decrease or lack of mucosal peptide antibiotics may play a central role in the
      etiopathogenesis of Crohn's disease. The dysregulated adaptive immune system may 
      reflect only the primary break of the mucosal defence since the immune response
      is mostly directed against luminal bacteria. Crohn's disease patients with ileal 
      involvement, as compared to controls and Crohn's disease patients without ileal
      disease, are characterized by a diminished expression of the ileal Paneth cell
      defensins. This decrease is even more pronounced in Crohn's disease patients with
      a mutation in the NOD2 gene, which is associated with Crohn's disease and ileal
      involvement. NOD2 is an intracellular peptidoglycan receptor and is expressed in 
      Paneth cells. In contrast to ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease of the colon is 
      characterized by an impaired induction of human beta defensins 2 and 3. The
      hypothesis of an impaired mucosal antibacterial activity is also consistent with 
      the benefit from antibiotic or probiotic treatment in certain disease states.

TI  - Absorption of the oral bisphosphonate alendronate in osteoporotic patients with
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1727-30
AB  - The absorption of bisphosphonates from the gut is poor. The question arises
      whether the absorption of alendronate, and thus its bioavailability, is further
      altered by the local inflammatory process in patients with Crohn's disease,
      thereby potentially affecting clinical outcome when used in the treatment of
      osteoporosis. To address this question, urinary excretion of alendronate was
      evaluated 3 months and 6 months after start of treatment with oral alendronate at
      a dose of 10 mg/day in 19 osteoporotic patients with stable Crohn's disease, 12
      of whom had an intestinal resection. Biochemical parameters of bone turnover and 
      BMD were also measured at start and at 6 months. Thirteen patients had been
      previously treated with glucocorticoids and five were currently using them. The
      average 24-h urinary excretion of alendronate was 0.5-0.6% of the dose
      administered, a figure comparable to that reported for osteoporotic patients
      without gut pathology. There was a significant decrease from baseline in urine
      N-telopeptides of collagen cross-links (NTx)/creatinine (60%) associated with an 
      increase in lumbar spine BMD of already 2% after 6 months of treatment. Our data 
      suggest that in patients with Crohn's disease, alendronate is adequately absorbed
      from the intestine and retained in the skeleton. This adequacy is confirmed by
      appropriate suppression of bone resorption and increase in lumbar spine BMD.
      These data hold significant implications for the clinical management of patients 
      with Crohn's disease and osteoporosis.

TI  - Personal view: food for thought--western lifestyle and susceptibility to Crohn's 
      disease. The FODMAP hypothesis.
PG  - 1399-409
AB  - Susceptibility to the development of Crohn's disease involves a combination of
      genetic and environmental factors. The association of Crohn's disease with
      westernization has implicated lifestyle factors in pathogenesis. While diet is a 
      likely candidate, evidence for specific changes in dietary habits and/or intake
      has been lacking. A new hypothesis is proposed, by which excessive delivery of
      highly fermentable but poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrates and polyols
      (designated FODMAPs--Fermentable Oligo-, Di- and Mono-saccharides And Polyols) to
      the distal small intestinal and colonic lumen is a dietary factor underlying
      susceptibility to Crohn's disease. The subsequent rapid fermentation of FODMAPs
      in the distal small and proximal large intestine induces conditions in the bowel 
      that lead to increased intestinal permeability, a predisposing factor to the
      development of Crohn's disease. Evidence supporting this hypothesis includes the 
      increasing intake of FODMAPs in western societies, the association of increased
      intake of sugars in the development of Crohn's disease, and the previously
      documented effects of the ingestion of excessive FODMAPs on the bowel. This
      hypothesis provides potential for the design of preventive strategies and raises 
      concern about current enthusiasm for putative health-promoting effects of
      FODMAPs. One of the greatest challenges in defining the pathogenesis of Crohn's
      disease is to identify predisposing environmental factors. Such an achievement
      might lead to the development of preventive strategies for, and the definition
      of, possible target for changing the natural history of this serious disease. The
      present paper describes a new hypothesis for one such environmental factor.

      Escherichia coli isolated from Crohn's disease patients to adhere to and to
      invade intestinal epithelial cells.
PG  - 2880-7
AB  - Ileal lesions in 36.4% of patients with Crohn's disease are colonized by
      pathogenic adherent-invasive Escherichia coli. The aim of this study was to
      determine the in vitro inhibitory effects of the probiotic strain, Lactobacillus 
      casei DN-114 001, on adhesion to and invasion of human intestinal epithelial
      cells by adherent-invasive E. coli isolated from Crohn's disease patients. The
      experiments were performed with undifferentiated Intestine-407 cells and with
      undifferentiated or differentiated Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells. Bacterial 
      adhesion to and invasion of intestinal epithelial cells were assessed by counting
      CFU. The inhibitory effects of L. casei were determined after coincubation with
      adherent-invasive E. coli or after preincubation of intestinal cells with L.
      casei prior to infection with adherent-invasive E. coli. Inhibitory effects of L.
      casei on adherent-invasive E. coli adhesion to differentiated and
      undifferentiated intestinal epithelial cells reached 75% to 84% in coincubation
      and 43% to 62% in preincubation experiments, according to the cell lines used.
      Addition of L. casei culture supernatant to the incubation medium increased L.
      casei adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells and enhanced the inhibitory effects
      of L. casei. The inhibitory effects on E. coli invasion paralleled those on
      adhesion. This effect was not due to a bactericidal effect on adherent-invasive
      E. coli or to a cytotoxic effect on epithelial intestinal cells. As Lactobacillus
      casei DN-114 001 strongly inhibits interaction of adherent-invasive E. coli with 
      intestinal epithelial cells, this finding suggests that the probiotic strain
      could be of therapeutic value in Crohn's disease.

TI  - [Role of intestinal flora in inflammatory bowel disease and probiotics place in
      their management].
PG  - 132-6
AB  - The pathogenic role of certain microorganism of intestinal flora has been
      demonstrated in experimental colitis in animals and strongly suspected in
      inflammatory bowel disease in human, especially in Crohn's disease and pouchitis.
      Probiotics are living non pathogenic microorganisms that, upon oral ingestion
      exert benefits on human health by modulating enteric flora or by stimulation of
      local immune system. The aim of this article is to remind the role of intestinal 
      flora in inflammatory bowel disease, the mechanism of inflammation induced by
      this flora and to review through the literature, the different clinical studies
      performed with probiotics in human.

TI  - Impact of elemental diet on mucosal inflammation in patients with active Crohn's 
      disease: cytokine production and endoscopic and histological findings.
PG  - 580-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine the impact of elemental diet on 
      mucosal inflammation in Crohn's disease (CD), mainly by cytokine measurements.
      METHODS: Twenty-eight consecutive patients with active CD were treated with an
      elemental diet (Elental) for 4 weeks. The mucosal biopsies were obtained from the
      terminal ileum and large bowel before and after treatment. As a control group,
      mucosal biopsies were obtained from 20 patients without inflammation. Mucosal
      cytokine concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
      RESULTS: After treatment, clinical remission was achieved in 20 patients (71%).
      Endoscopic healing and improvement rates were 44% and 76% in the terminal ileum
      and 39% and 78% in the large bowel, respectively. Histologic healing and
      improvement rates were 19% and 54% in the terminal ileum and 20% and 55% in the
      large bowel, respectively. Before treatment, the mucosal concentrations of
      interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), IL-6, IL-8, and tumor 
      necrosis factor-alpha in the ileum and large bowel were significantly higher than
      in controls. These cytokine concentrations decreased to the levels of control
      after treatment. IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio in the ileum and large bowel was
      significantly lower than in controls before treatment. The ratio increased to the
      level of controls after treatment. The endoscopic and histologic healing of the
      mucosal inflammation was associated with a decline of the mucosal cytokines and
      an increase of the IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio. CONCLUSIONS: The elemental diet
      (Elental) reduced mucosal cytokine production and corrected an imbalance between 
      proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in CD.

TI  - Nutritional therapy for Crohn's disease in Japan.
PG  - 25-31
AB  - In Japan, nutritional therapy as both a primary and as a secondary treatment is
      widely used for Crohn's disease (CD). The rationale for its use is based on a
      variety of reasons. The first is its ability to induce remission and to
      ameliorate the activity of intestinal lesions in the short term by enteral (EN)
      or by parenteral nutritional therapy in which overexpressions of chemokine
      receptors in an active stage are decreased significantly in the remission stage. 
      Second is its ability to maintain remission over the long term through home-based
      enteral nutrition in which tube feeding during the nighttime is encouraged. Third
      is its ability to reduce the steroid dosage over the period of a long-term
      treatment course. However, several disadvantages of this therapy such as
      unpalatability and sluggish effect have been pointed out. Several studies have
      attempted to resolve this issue and determine the best components of EN,
      especially in fat composition. Some data have been suggestive of too much
      long-chained fatty acid having a hazardous effect on EN's clinical efficacy
      because it works as a precursor of inflammatory prostaglandins. Our recent data
      show that medium-chained triglyceride did not have such a hazardous effect on
      clinical efficacy. Several studies suggested that the patient factors that were
      resistant to inducing remission in the short term were a long period of suffering
      CD, a high activity (on Crohn's Disease Activity Index, CDAI), hemorrhagic
      colitis, and colitis with marked cobblestoning. Japanese guidelines for the
      treatment of CD recommended nutritional therapy as a first-line therapy and as a 
      maintenance therapy after inducing remission. This treatment policy has led to
      Japanese CD patients having lower mortality rates than that of patients who do
      not receive EN. If this therapy could be combined with other drug therapies,
      including strong immunosuppressants, treatment strategies would be improved over 
      those we have at present.

TI  - Seasonality of vitamin D status and bone turnover in patients with Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 1073-83
AB  - BACKGROUND: While winter-time vitamin D deficiency has been well-documented in
      Crohn's disease patients, less is known about vitamin D status during summertime 
      and whether a seasonal variation exists in bone turnover. AIMS: To compare
      vitamin D status and bone turnover markers in Crohn's disease patients with age- 
      and sex-matched controls during late-summer and late-winter. SUBJECTS: Crohn's
      disease patients (n = 44; mean age 36.9 years, currently in remission) and
      matched controls (n = 44) were recruited from Cork University Hospital and Cork
      City area, respectively. METHODS: Bloods were analysed for 25-hydroxyvitamin D,
      parathyroid hormone, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin and urine
      analysed for N-telopeptides of type 1 collagen. RESULTS: Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin 
      D concentrations were significantly (P < 0.003) lower in Crohn's disease patients
      than in control subjects during both seasons. In Crohn's disease patients, serum 
      25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were lower (P < 0.0001) whereas serum
      parathyroid hormone, osteocalcin and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and
      urinary N-telopeptides of type 1 collagen levels were higher (P < 0.001) during
      late-winter than late-summer. CONCLUSION: There were notable seasonal variations 
      in vitamin D status and bone turnover markers in Crohn's disease patients. The
      impact of winter decline in vitamin D status and increase in bone turnover on
      long-term risk of osteopenia/osteoporosis in Crohn's disease patients is unclear.

TI  - Environmental factors in familial Crohn's disease in Belgium.
PG  - 360-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Environmental factors are believed to trigger the onset of Crohn's
      disease (CD) in genetically susceptible individuals. The aim of this study was to
      assess environmental and familial factors that might be etiologically related to 
      CD. METHODS: Twenty-one families with 3 or more affected first-degree relatives
      were studied, together with 10 matched control families. There were 74 patients
      with CD, 84 unaffected family members, and 59 controls. Family members were
      interviewed together at the parental home. A 176-item questionnaire delved into
      first symptoms, childhood vaccinations and diseases, food items, potable water
      supplies, social activities, travel, pets, and home and surrounding environment. 
      Questions were directed specifically for 2 time-frames, childhood until age 20
      and a 10-year epoch before the onset of first symptoms within a family. The
      possible factors linked to disease were evaluated using univariate and
      multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: There were significantly more smokers 
      in the patients and their relatives than in controls. Patients had more
      appendicitis during adolescence, ate less oats, rye, and bran than controls, and 
      consumed more unpasteurized cheese. Patients drank significantly less tap water
      and more well water than controls. Clustering of cases in time occurred in 13 of 
      the 21 affected families. CONCLUSIONS: The less frequent consumption of oats,
      rye, and bran and the more frequent eating of unpasteurized cheeses imitate
      potential dietary influences on gastrointestinal flora. More importantly, our
      data suggest that the drinking of well water represents an important risk factor 
      for CD.

TI  - Resting energy expenditure in the parenterally fed pediatric population with
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 102-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malnutrition is a common sequela of Crohn's disease (CD) and may
      result in reduced skeletal muscle function and growth retardation. Energy
      requirements of parenterally fed hospitalized pediatric patients with active CD
      were measured using indirect calorimetry, to assess whether Food Agriculture
      Organization (FAO)/World Health Organization (WHO)/United Nations University
      (UNU) equations provide appropriate estimations of energy requirements in this
      patient population. METHODS: Twenty hospitalized patients with active CD fed
      exclusively via parenteral nutrition (PN) were investigated. A chart review and
      patient interviews were conducted to assess disease duration, location,
      laboratory parameters, and symptomology associated with CD. Disease severity was 
      quantified using the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index. Each subject
      underwent indirect calorimetry, bioelectrical impedance analysis, and
      anthropometric assessment once the ordered PN met estimated macronutrient
      requirements of each patient (predicted resting energy expenditure x1.3).
      Predicted resting energy expenditure (REE) was determined using the FAO/WHO/UNU
      equations. RESULTS: REE showed a strong correlation with predicted REE (r(2) =
      .73, p < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Measured REE did not significantly differ from
      predicted resting energy requirements. This indicates that REE for the
      parenterally fed pediatric patients with CD can be accurately predicted using the
      FAO/WHO/UNU equations.

TI  - [Energy losses from a short bowel: not only fat].
PG  - 381-4
AB  - Two adult patients, men aged 43 and 45 years, with Crohn's disease, complicated
      by high-output small-bowel-stomy and short-bowel syndrome due to several
      intestinal resections, presented with extreme weight loss. Although both patients
      followed a high-calorie diet combining solid foods and enteral nutrition by
      nasogastric tube, containing 16,000 kJ and 21,000 kJ, respectively, weight loss
      continued. Faecal fat excretion and basal metabolic rate were determined, but
      these could not explain the caloric deficit. Therefore, faecal bomb calorimetry, 
      a measurement of total faecal energy content, was also performed, revealing a
      considerably higher faecal energy loss than had been calculated from faecal fat
      excretion; this indicates that faecal carbohydrate loss plays an important
      supplementary role. A stable weightwas achieved in both patients by prescribing
      extra food. Therefore, faecal fat excretion is an insufficient indicator of total
      faecal calorie loss in patients with high-output stomata and short-bowel
      syndrome. Bomb calorimetry may be considered as a tool to determine the remaining
      absorptive capacity in short-bowel patients.

TI  - Lack of efficacy of a reduced microparticle diet in a multi-centred trial of
      patients with active Crohn's disease.
PG  - 377-84
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Dietary microparticles, which are bacteria-sized and
      non-biological, found in the modern Western diet, have been implicated in both
      the aetiology and pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Following on from the findings
      of a previous pilot study, we aimed to confirm whether a reduction in the amount 
      of dietary microparticles facilitates induction of remission in patients with
      active Crohn's disease, in a single-blind, randomized, multi-centre, placebo
      controlled trial. METHODS: Eighty-three patients with active Crohn's disease were
      randomly allocated in a 2 x 2 factorial design to a diet low or normal in
      microparticles and/or calcium for 16 weeks. All patients received a reducing dose
      of prednisolone for 6 weeks. Outcome measures were Crohn's disease activity
      index, Van Hees index, quality of life and a series of objective measures of
      inflammation including erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein,
      intestinal permeability and faecal calprotectin. After 16 weeks patients returned
      to their normal diet and were followed up for a further 36 weeks. RESULTS:
      Dietary manipulation provided no added effect to corticosteroid treatment on any 
      of the outcome measures during the dietary trial (16 weeks) or follow-up (to 1
      year); e.g., for logistic regression of Crohn's disease activity index based
      rates of remission (P=0.1) and clinical response (P=0.8), in normal versus low
      microparticle groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our adequately powered and carefully
      controlled dietary trial found no evidence that reducing microparticle intake
      aids remission in active Crohn's disease.

TI  - Anisakis infestation: a case of acute abdomen mimicking Crohn's disease and
      eosinophilic gastroenteritis.
PG  - 62-4
AB  - Anisakiasis is a rare parasitic disease transmitted to humans by the ingestion of
      raw fish, which can initially present with acute abdomen. We report the case of a
      man, a habitual consumer of raw fish, who underwent surgery for acute abdomen,
      initially attributed to Crohn's disease and then later interpreted as
      eosinophilic enteritis. Only the subsequent careful histological examination of
      the surgical specimen, revealing full thickness eosinophilic infiltrate,
      generally typical of infestation, led to the detection of Anisakis simplex larva.
      In cases of acute abdomen, in the presence of a positive history of raw fish
      ingestion, it is therefore reasonable to consider the possibility of anisakiasis.

TI  - Probiotic therapy of intestinal inflammation and infections.
PG  - 44-50
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The author presents evidence published during the past year
      regarding treatment of clinical and experimental intestinal inflammation and
      infections by probiotic agents. RECENT FINDINGS: Normal commensal bacteria are
      implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic, immune-mediated intestinal
      inflammation, particularly Crohn disease and pouchitis, whereas viral, bacterial,
      fungal, and protozoan infections are increasingly important with widespread use
      of immunosuppressive agents and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Combinations of
      Lactobacilli, Bifidobacteria, and Streptococcus salivarius prevent relapse of
      recurrent pouchitis and perhaps decrease the initial onset of pouch inflammation,
      whereas Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 maintains remission in ulcerative colitis.
      Several agents offer promise as primary therapy of ulcerative colitis. Use of
      probiotics in Crohn disease remains unsubstantiated. Animal models demonstrate
      marked differences in responses among various probiotic bacterial species and
      that nonviable organisms can have therapeutic efficacy. Probiotics have multiple 
      mechanisms of action, including prevention of pathogenic bacterial growth,
      binding to or penetration of pathogens to mucosal surfaces, stimulation of
      mucosal barrier function, or altering immunoregulation (decreasing
      proinflammatory and promoting protective molecules). Although multiple probiotic 
      species block epithelial adhesion and invasion by microbial pathogens in vitro,
      their proven utility in clinical infections is limited to accelerating recovery
      from acute infectious diarrhea and preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea.
      SUMMARY: Probiotics offer promise for physiologic, nontoxic treatment of
      pouchitis, ulcerative colitis, and acute infectious diarrhea, but larger,
      controlled clinical studies must be performed to clarify optimal agents; doses;
      combinations of various probiotics, prebiotics, and antibiotics; and therapeutic 
      conditions.

TI  - Longitudinal monitoring of bone measured by quantitative multisite ultrasound in 
      patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 120-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is characterized, among other features, by
      intestinal malabsorption of minerals, vitamins, and various food ingredients.
      This may cause a suboptimal peak bone mass and thereby susceptibility to
      osteoporosis at an early age. OBJECTIVE: Longitudinal measurement of bone in CD
      during active disease and during remission. DESIGN: We evaluated 24 patients with
      CD (16 males) 14 to 16 years of age longitudinally, every 3 months over 12
      months, for disease activity. Longitudinal follow-up by quantitative ultrasound
      measurement using a bone sonometer (Sunlight Omnisense, Tel Aviv, Israel) that
      obtains axial speed of sound (SOS) was also performed. Eight of the CD patients
      were in remission (R-CD), characterized by accelerated weight and height gain and
      near-normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate and serum iron. Eight patients had
      active CD (A-CD), and 8 patients were under treatment with oxandrolone. RESULTS: 
      By two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance, the change in SOS Z-score of
      tibia at 0, 6, and 12 months was as follows: -0.5 +/- 0.2 to -0.3 +/- 0.2, -0.6
      +/- 0.2 to -1.0 +/- 0.5 and -0.6 +/- 0.2 to -0.4 +/- 0.2 in the remission, active
      disease, and oxandrolone-treated groups, respectively (P < 0.001). Similarly, the
      change in SOS Z-score of radius during the study was as follows: -0.5 +/- 0.3 to 
      -0.6 +/- 0.3, -0.6 +/- 0.3 to -1.0 +/- 0.3 and -0.6 +/- 0.2 to -0.4 +/- 0.2 in
      the remission, active disease, and oxandrolone-treated groups, respectively (P < 
      0.001). While a small change over time in patients in remission was noted, SOS
      decreased in patients with active disease and increased in oxandrolone-treated
      patients. Despite the fact that SOS remained in the normative range in all
      patients, a clear deterioration was demonstrated for patients with active
      disease. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that longitudinal follow-up of patients with
      active disease may detect an early pattern of deterioration in quality of bone.

TI  - Dietary risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease: a multicenter case-control
      study in Japan.
PG  - 154-63
AB  - To evaluate the role of dietary factors in the etiology of inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD), we conducted a multicenter hospital-based case-control study in a 
      Japanese population. Cases were IBD patients aged 15 to 34 years [ulcerative
      colitis (UC) 111 patients; Crohn's disease (CD) 128 patients] within 3 years
      after diagnosis in 13 hospitals. One control subject was recruited for each case 
      who was matched for sex, age, and hospital. A semiquantitative food frequency
      questionnaire was used to estimate preillness intakes of food groups and
      nutrients. All the available control subjects (n = 219) were pooled, and
      unconditional logistic models were applied to calculate odds ratios (ORs). In the
      food groups, a higher consumption of sweets was positively associated with UC
      risk [OR for the highest versus lowest quartile, 2.86; 95% confidence interval
      (CI), 1.24 to 6.57], whereas the consumption of sugars and sweeteners (OR, 2.12; 
      95% CI, 1.08 to 4.17), sweets (OR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.38 to 5.83), fats and oils
      (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.29 to 5.39), and fish and shellfish (OR, 2.41; 95% CI,
      1.18-4.89) were positively associated with CD risk. In respect to nutrients, the 
      intake of vitamin C (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.99) was negatively related to UC
      risk, while the intake of total fat (OR, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.39 to 5.90),
      monounsaturated fatty acids (OR, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.23 to 5.03) and polyunsaturated 
      fatty acids (OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.12 to 4.79), vitamin E (OR, 3.23; 95% CI, 1.45
      to 7.17), and n-3 (OR, 3.24; 95% CI, 1.52 to 6.88) and n-6 fatty acids (OR, 2.57;
      95% CI, 1.24 to 5.32) was positively associated with CD risk. Although this study
      suffers from the shortcoming of recall bias, which is inherent in most
      retrospective studies (prospective studies are warranted to confirm the
      associations between diet and IBD risk), the present findings suggest the
      importance of dietary factors for IBD prevention.

TI  - Tissue levels and post-prandial secretion of the intestinal growth factor,
      glucagon-like peptide-2, in controls and inflammatory bowel disease: comparison
      with peptide YY.
PG  - 207-12
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) and peptide YY (PYY) are
      produced in endocrine L-cells of the intestine and secreted in response to food
      intake. GLP-2 has a trophic effect on the intestinal epithelium, whereas PYY has 
      pro-absorptive effects. It can be speculated that, in inflammatory bowel disease 
      (IBD), the production and secretion of GLP-2 and PYY could be affected as a part 
      of a regulatory mechanism. Therefore, tissue levels and meal-stimulated secretion
      of GLP-2 and PYY were studied in IBD patients and compared to controls. METHODS: 
      Outpatients with IBD and control patients were included. Mucosal biopsies were
      taken from the ileum and colon and the content of GLP-2 and PYY was measured.
      After colonoscopy the patients took a mixed meal and plasma was collected for 90 
      min for plasma measurements of GLP-2 and PYY. RESULTS: Tissue levels of GLP-2 in 
      control patients were highest in the terminal ileum (407+/-82 pmol/g tissue,
      n=10), whereas PYY was highest in the rectum (919+/-249 pmol/g tissue, n=10). In 
      IBD patients with acute inflammation, the content of GLP-2 was similar to
      controls, whereas PYY was decreased to 72.1+/-17.7% (P=0.03, n=13) of control
      values. Neither the fasting plasma levels nor the meal responses of GLP-2 and PYY
      differed between controls and IBD patients. CONCLUSION: The similar responses of 
      GLP-2 and PYY in patients and controls do not support the suggestion that L-cell 
      secretion is altered in IBD. The decreased tissue PYY concentrations may
      contribute to the diarrhoea of some of these patients.

TI  - Prototypic disorders of gastrointestinal mucosal immune function: Celiac disease 
      and Crohn's disease.
PG  - 25-30
AB  - Celiac disease is a disorder of the small intestine characterized by chronic
      inflammation of the mucosa and protean clinical manifestations caused by loss of 
      tolerance to dietary antigens. Two strongly associated cofactors have been
      identified: the presence of HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 in the host and specific antigenic
      peptides in the diet that are present in wheat, rye, and barley. Most patients
      have complete remission after dietary elimination of these foods. Crohn's disease
      is characterized by chronic, relapsing, recurrent, focal, transmural inflammation
      of the gastrointestinal tract that can lead to multiple serious problems
      requiring chronic medical and surgical therapy. Crohn's disease is associated
      with multiple genetic mutations, at least one of which has been clearly
      implicated in innate immunity. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the
      disease involves abnormal immune responses to gut microbial flora.
