TI  - Current status of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis infection in
      animals & humans in India: What needs to be done?
PG  - 661-671

AB  - Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) has emerged as a major
      health problem for domestic livestock and human beings. Reduced per animal
      productivity of domestic livestock seriously impacts the economics of dairy
      farming globally. High to very high bioload of MAP in domestic livestock and also
      in the human population has been reported from north India. Presence of live MAP 
      bacilli in commercial supplies of raw and pasteurized milk and milk products
      indicates its public health significance. MAP is not inactivated during
      pasteurization, therefore, entering into human food chain daily. Recovery of MAP 
      from patients with inflammatory bowel disease or Crohn's disease and animal
      healthcare workers suffering with chronic gastrointestinal problems indicate a
      close association of MAP with a number of chronic and other diseases affecting
      human health. Higher bioload of MAP in the animals increases the risk of exposure
      to the human population with MAP. This review summarizes the current status of
      MAP infection in animals as well as in human beings and also highlights the
      prospects of effective management and control of disease in animals to reduce the
      risk of exposure to human population.

TI  - ESPEN guideline: Clinical nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The ESPEN guideline presents a multidisciplinary focus on clinical 
      nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODOLOGY: The guideline is
      based on extensive systematic review of the literature, but relies on expert
      opinion when objective data were lacking or inconclusive. The conclusions and 64 
      recommendations have been subject to full peer review and a Delphi process in
      which uniformly positive responses (agree or strongly agree) were required.
      RESULTS: IBD is increasingly common and potential dietary factors in its
      aetiology are briefly reviewed. Malnutrition is highly prevalent in IBD -
      especially in Crohn's disease. Increased energy and protein requirements are
      observed in some patients. The management of malnutrition in IBD is considered
      within the general context of support for malnourished patients. Treatment of
      iron deficiency (parenterally if necessary) is strongly recommended. Routine
      provision of a special diet in IBD is not however supported. Parenteral nutrition
      is indicated only when enteral nutrition has failed or is impossible. The
      recommended perioperative management of patients with IBD undergoing surgery
      accords with general ESPEN guidance for patients having abdominal surgery.
      Probiotics may be helpful in UC but not Crohn's disease. Primary therapy using
      nutrition to treat IBD is not supported in ulcerative colitis, but is moderately 
      well supported in Crohn's disease, especially in children where the adverse
      consequences of steroid therapy are proportionally greater. However, exclusion
      diets are generally not recommended and there is little evidence to support any
      particular formula feed when nutritional regimens are constructed. CONCLUSIONS:
      Available objective data to guide nutritional support and primary nutritional
      therapy in IBD are presented as 64 recommendations, of which 9 are very strong
      recommendations (grade A), 22 are strong recommendations (grade B) and 12 are
      based only on sparse evidence (grade 0); 21 recommendations are good practice
      points (GPP).

TI  - Correction of vitamin D deficiency using sublingually administered vitamin D2 in 
      a Crohn's disease patient with mal-absorption and a new ileostomy.

AB  - Vitamin D deficiency has been shown to be associated with many adverse health
      problems. Studies have shown that patients with Crohn's disease who have low
      vitamin D levels have a poorer quality of life than those with more adequate
      levels. It has also been shown that patients with mal-absorption problems have a 
      difficult time achieving normal vitamin D levels in spite of aggressive
      supplementation, and that exposure to UVB radiation may be the most effective
      treatment option for these patients. We present a case in which 25-hydroxyvitamin
      D levels were normalized within 2 weeks in a severely vitamin D deficient patient
      with Crohn's disease with mal-absorption and a new ileostomy, utilizing
      sublingually administered vitamin D2. A 58 year-old white female was admitted
      with a new ileostomy following partial bowel resection due to complications from 
      Crohn's disease. She was found to be severely vitamin D deficient at the time of 
      admission, with a level of 6.1ng/ml on hospital day 3. Her treatment with vitamin
      D was delayed for a few days. She was initially treated with 5000 units of
      vitamin D3 orally twice a day for 3days (days 7-10). After discussion with the
      patient and obtaining her consent, vitamin D3 was stopped, and she was then
      treated with a total of 8 doses of 50,000 units of vitamin D2 administered
      sublingually. She was given the first 3 doses on alternating days (days 11, 13,
      15), and then 5 more doses on consecutive days (days 17-21). The rise in her
      25-hydroxyvitamin D level in response to treatment with sublingual vitamin D2 was
      significant. On day 10, after receiving 3days of orally administered vitamin D3, 
      her level was 9.8ng/ml. One week later, after receiving 3 sublingual doses of
      vitamin D2, it rose to 20.3ng/ml. It was then measured on alternating days twice 
      over the next 4days, and it rose to 45.5ng/ml, and then to 47.4ng/ml on the day
      of discharge to home. The major finding of this study is that sublingual
      administration of vitamin D2 appears to work effectively when intestinal
      absorption is impaired. The optimal dosing regimen still needs to be determined
      for the average Crohn's disease patient.

AB  - Vitamin D has emerged as a key regulator of innate immune responses to pathogen
      threat. The hormonal form of vitamin D signals through a nuclear receptor
      transcription factor and regulates gene transcription. Several papers have shown 
      that vitamin D signaling is active both upstream and downstream of pattern
      recognition receptors, vanguards of innate immune responses. Crohn's disease (CD)
      is a relapsing-recurring inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that arises from
      dysregulated intestinal innate immunity. Indeed, genetic studies have identified 
      several CD susceptibility markers linked to mechanisms of innate immune responses
      to infection. Interest in links between vitamin D deficiency and CD has grown
      substantially, particularly in the last five years. While a number of studies
      have consistently revealed an association between CD and vitamin D deficiency,
      recent experimental work has uncovered a compelling mechanistic basis for the
      contribution of vitamin D deficiency to the pathogenesis of the disease.
      Moreover, a number of intervention trials have provided generally solid evidence 
      that robust vitamin D supplementation may be of therapeutic benefit to patients
      with CD. This review summarizes these laboratory and clinical findings.

TI  - Alterations in glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activities in
      plasma and saliva in relation to disease activity in patients with Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 709-715
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory condition with uncertain
      aetiology. Dysfunction of immunoregulatory factors and overproduction of reactive
      oxygen species (ROS) may contribute to the damage of the gastrointestinal tract. 
      Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) are involved in
      protection of cells from the damaging effects of ROS. The aim of the study was to
      assess activity of antioxidative stress enzymes, GPx and SOD, in plasma and
      saliva of patients with active and inactive forms of CD. Forty-seven patients
      with CD were prospectively enrolled in the study. The control group comprised 25 
      healthy volunteers. Patients' demographics, clinical features, localization of
      inflammatory changes, CD history, and treatment were recorded. SOD and GPx were
      assayed in plasma and saliva samples by ELISA method. CD activity index (CDAI)
      scores correlated inversely with SOD in plasma (r = - 0.46; P = 0.0012), but not 
      in saliva. No correlations were observed in respect to GPx activities in both
      plasma and saliva and CDAI. Higher activity of plasma SOD was observed in
      patients with inactive CD in comparison with active CD (P = 0.004). No
      significant differences in SOD and GPx activity both in plasma and saliva were
      found between CD remission group and the control group. We concluded that in
      active CD the antioxidant defence system was diminished and returned to normal
      values in remission. Results of SOD and GPx assays in saliva are not conclusive, 
      suggesting that saliva seems to be not an appropriate material for further
      similar studies.

TI  - Impact of High-Dose Vitamin D3 Supplementation in Patients with Crohn's Disease
      in Remission: A Pilot Randomized Double-Blind Controlled Study.
PG  - 448-455
LID - 10.1007/s10620-016-4396-7 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To assess the tolerability and efficacy of high-dose vitamin D3 in patients 
      with Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind
      placebo-controlled trial of high-dose vitamin D3 at 10,000 IU daily (n = 18)
      compared to 1000 IU daily (n = 16) for 12 months in patients with CD in
      remission. The primary outcome was change in serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D levels.
      Secondary outcomes included clinical relapse rates and changes in mood scores.
      RESULTS: High-dose vitamin D3 at 10,000 IU daily significantly improved
      25-hydroxy-vitamin D levels from a mean of 73.5 nmol/L [standard deviation (SD)
      11.7 nmol/L] to 160.8 nmol/L (SD 43.2 nmol/L) (p = 0.02). On an
      intention-to-treat basis, the rate of relapse was not significantly different
      between patients receiving low- and high-dose vitamin D3 (68.8 vs 33.3%, p =
      0.0844). In per-protocol analysis, clinical relapse of Crohn's disease was less
      frequently observed in patients receiving a high dose (0/12 or 0%) compared to
      those receiving a low dose of 1000 IU daily (3/8 or 37.5%) (p = 0.049).
      Improvement in anxiety and depression scores and a good safety profile were
      observed in both groups treated with vitamin D3. CONCLUSIONS: Oral
      supplementation with high-dose vitamin D3 at 10,000 IU daily significantly
      improved serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D levels. Rates of clinical relapse were
      similar between both groups. Larger studies using high-dose vitamin D3 for
      treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases are warranted. CLINICALTRIALS. GOV

TI  - Ustekinumab in treatment of Crohn's disease: design, development, and potential
      place in therapy.
PG  - 3685-3698
AB  - Crohn's disease is characterized by a dysregulation of both innate and adaptive
      immunity responses. Interleukin-12/23 (IL-12/23) pathway has been found to be a
      major driver of inflammation in adaptive immune responses. Ustekinumab is a fully
      human immunoglobulin G1 kappa monoclonal antibody that blocks the p40 subunit of 
      IL-12 and IL-23 and prevents their interaction with their cell surface receptor
      and further cytokine activation. It is currently approved in the management of
      plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Very promising data have emerged
      through phase II and phase III trials (UNITI-1, UNITI-2, and IM-UNITI) for both
      induction and maintenance of clinical response and remission in
      moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease, resulting in approval by the Food and Drug
      Administration for this condition. This article reviews the immunology of the
      IL-12/23 pathway, available data regarding the initial designing of ustekinumab, 
      drug development through clinical trials including pharmacokinetics, efficacy,
      and safety, and its potential place in the treatment of Crohn's disease.

AB  - It is now widely acknowledged that the intestinal bacterial flora together with
      genetic predisposing factors significantly contribute to the immunopathogenesis
      of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as reflected by mucosal immune dysregulation.
      Recently, there has been an increased interest in nutraceutical therapies,
      including probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics. Other dietary interventions with
      low carbohydrate diet, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and glutamine have
      been attempted to downregulate the gut inflammatory response and thereby
      alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms. Enteral nutrition has been widely used as
      induction and maintenance therapies in the management of Crohn's disease (CD). In
      this review, a critical assessment of the results of clinical trial outcomes and 
      meta-analyses was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of dietary and enteral
      interventions for CD.

AB  - Melatonin is produced in the pineal gland as well as many other organs, including
      the enterochromaffin cells of the digestive mucosa. Melatonin is a powerful
      antioxidant that resists oxidative stress due to its capacity to directly
      scavenge reactive species, to modulate the antioxidant defense system by
      increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes, and to stimulate the innate
      immune response through its direct and indirect actions. In addition, the
      dysregulation of the circadian system is observed to be related with alterations 
      in colonic motility and cell disruptions due to the modifications of clock genes 
      expression. In the gastrointestinal tract, the activities of melatonin are
      mediated by melatonin receptors (MT2), serotonin (5-HT), and cholecystokinin B
      (CCK2) receptors and via receptor-independent processes. The levels of melatonin 
      in the gastrointestinal tract exceed by 10-100 times the blood concentrations.
      Also, there is an estimated 400 times more melatonin in the gut than in the
      pineal gland. Gut melatonin secretion is suggested to be influenced by the food
      intake. Low dose melatonin treatment accelerates intestinal transit time whereas 
      high doses may decrease gut motility. Melatonin has been studied as a co-adjuvant
      treatment in several gastrointestinal diseases including irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS), constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C), diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D),
      Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and necrotizing enterocolitis. The purpose
      of this review is to provide information regarding the potential benefits of
      melatonin as a co-adjuvant treatment in gastrointestinal diseases, especially
      IBS, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and necrotizing enterocolitis.

TI  - Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's Disease Are Associated with Decreased Serum
      Selenium Concentrations and Increased Cardiovascular Risk.
LID - E780 [pii]
AB  - The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and associated oxidative stress
      is increasing. The antioxidant mineral selenium (Se) was measured in serum
      samples from 106 IBD patients (53 with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 53 with
      Crohn's disease (CD)) and from 30 healthy controls. Serum Se concentrations were 
      significantly lower in UC and CD patients than in healthy controls (p < 0.001)
      and significantly lower in CD patients than in UC patients (p = 0.006). Se
      concentrations in patients were significantly influenced by sex, body mass index 
      (BMI), the inflammatory biomarker alpha-1-antitrypsin, surgery, medical
      treatment, the severity, extent, and form of the disease and the length of time
      since onset (p < 0.05). Se concentrations in IBD patients were positively and
      linearly correlated with nutritional (protein, albumin, prealbumin,
      cholinesterase and total cholesterol) and iron status-related (hemoglobin, Fe and
      hematocrit) parameters (p < 0.05). A greater impairment of serum Se and
      cardiovascular status was observed in CD than in UC patients. An adequate
      nutritional Se status is important in IBD patients to minimize the cardiovascular
      risk associated with increased inflammation biomarkers, especially in
      undernourished CD patients, and is also related to an improved nutritional and
      body iron status.

TI  - Evaluation of Serum Trace Element Levels and Superoxide Dismutase Activity in
      Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Translating Basic Research into
      Clinical Application.
PG  - 235-240
LID - 10.1007/s12011-016-0891-0 [doi]
AB  - The relationship of minerals and trace elements with inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) is complex. Alterations in their metabolism can be induced by the diseases 
      and their complications. To study the role of trace elements in IBD patients'
      serum zinc and copper and their related enzymes, including superoxide dismutase
      (SOD), activity were measured in patients with IBD patients as well as in healthy
      subjects. In addition, the correlation between serum trace element levels,
      albumin, total protein, urea level, copper/zinc ratio, and disease activity (DA) 
      was determined in these subjects. Serum samples were obtained from 35 patients
      (19 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 16 Crohn's disease (CD)) in the active phase of
      the disease and 30 healthy control subjects. Serum levels of zinc, copper, SOD
      activity, albumin, total protein, and urea were measured. The results were
      compared between the two groups using independent Student's t test in statistical
      analysis. Serum levels of zinc, SOD activity, albumin, and total protein were
      significantly lower (P < 0.05) in patients than controls, while serum urea level 
      was significantly higher in patients compared to controls. Copper concentrations 
      did not differ between patients with IBD (mean +/- SD, 58.8 +/- 20.7 mug/d) and
      controls (55.57 +/- 12.6 mug/d). Decreased levels of zinc and SOD activity are
      associated with increased inflammatory processes indicating inappropriate
      antioxidant system in patients with IBD. Additionally, lower levels of albumin
      and total protein with higher level of urea reflect metabolic problems in liver
      system.

TI  - Does Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy trigger or protect against Crohn's
      disease?
PG  - 349-354
AB  - Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is involved in multiple
      gastrointestinal and extra-gastrointestinal disorders. This review focuses on
      possible link between H. pylori eradication and Crohn's disease (CD) which is a
      chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Fecal calprotectin and; to lesser
      extent; fecal lactoferrin are sensitive and specific markers for monitoring CD
      activity. Data about link between H. pylori eradication and CD are limited and
      inconclusive. The infection likely shifts equilibrium between T helper 1 (Th1)
      and Th2 immune responses to the Th2 pattern. In subjects genetically predisposed 
      to CD (a Th1-related disease), H. pylori eradication increases Th1
      proinflammatory cytokines causing development of CD. In contrast, clarithromycin 
      and/or proton pump inhibitors that are used to eradicate H. pylori can suppress
      Th1 factors, and theoretically can protect against CD, but there are no data to
      support this supposition. This Th1/Th2 approach seems very simplistic. Another
      theory is that alterations in gut microbiota form "continuous antigenic
      stimulation" predisposing to IBD. H. pylori infection can inhibit such
      stimulation through activation of regulatory T cells, and thus eradication may
      predispose to CD. Probiotics weren't found useful in treatment of CD. The
      reported data about link between H. pylori eradication and CD are currently
      limited. Case reports, suggesting a positive association between both conditions,
      provide a very little evidence. On eradicating H. pylori in CD patients and/or
      patients with high risk for CD, patient counseling and follow-up in addition to
      measuring fecal calprotectin may help monitor CD activity. (Acta gastro-enterol. 
      belg., 2016, 79, 349-354).

AB  - The most common question asked by patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) 
      is, "Doctor, what should I eat?" Findings from epidemiology studies have
      indicated that diets high in animal fat and low in fruits and vegetables are the 
      most common pattern associated with an increased risk of IBD. Low levels of
      vitamin D also appear to be a risk factor for IBD. In murine models, diets high
      in fat, especially saturated animal fats, also increase inflammation, whereas
      supplementation with omega 3 long-chain fatty acids protect against intestinal
      inflammation. Unfortunately, omega 3 supplements have not been shown to decrease 
      the risk of relapse in patients with Crohn's disease. Dietary intervention
      studies have shown that enteral therapy, with defined formula diets, helps
      children with Crohn's disease and reduces inflammation and dysbiosis. Although
      fiber supplements have not been shown definitively to benefit patients with IBD, 
      soluble fiber is the best way to generate short-chain fatty acids such as
      butyrate, which has anti-inflammatory effects. Addition of vitamin D and curcumin
      has been shown to increase the efficacy of IBD therapy. There is compelling
      evidence from animal models that emulsifiers in processed foods increase risk for
      IBD. We discuss current knowledge about popular diets, including the specific
      carbohydrate diet and diet low in fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides
      and polyols. We present findings from clinical and basic science studies to help 
      gastroenterologists navigate diet as it relates to the management of IBD.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Both science and patients associate diet with inflammatory
      bowel disease [IBD]. There is no doubt that links between IBD and diet are
      numerous, based on both epidemiological studies and experimental studies.
      However, scientific evidence to support dietary advice is currently lacking, and 
      dietary counselling for IBD patients is often limited in clinical practice to the
      improvement of nutrient intake. This review aimed to focus on both patient's
      beliefs about and molecular mechanisms for crosstalk between nutrients and
      inflammation. METHODS: A literature search using PubMed was performed to identify
      relevant studies on diet and/or nutrients and their role in IBD. Pubmed [from
      inception to January 20, 2016] was searched using the terms: 'Crohn', 'colitis','
      intestinal epithelial cells', and a list of terms relating to diet or numerous
      specific nutrients. Terms associated with nutrients were individually tested in
      the context of IBD. Reference lists from studies selected were manually searched 
      to identify further relevant reports. Manuscripts about diet in the context of
      IBD from basic science, epidemiological studies, or clinical trials were selected
      and reviewed. Only articles published in English were included. RESULTS:
      Epidemiological studies highlight the key role of diet in IBD development, and
      many IBD patients report diet as a triggering factor in relapse of disease. In
      addition, we present research on the impact of nutrients on innate immunity.
      CONCLUSION: Diet may offer an alternative approach to restoring deficient innate 
      immunity in IBD, and this may be the scientific rationale for providing dietary
      counselling for IBD patients.

TI  - Reflections About Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Vitamins A and D.
PG  - 1105-1110
AB  - Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are two major forms of the inflammatory
      bowel diseases (IBDs). Vitamin A (VA) and vitamin D (VD) may be associated with
      reduction in inflammation in these disorders. The aim of this review was to show 
      the current evidence that may associate VA and VD with IBDs. Data linking VA, VD,
      and IBDs were studied. Both VA and VD may be related to the immune system in
      different manners. The active form of VA, retinoic acid, may be related to the
      growth factor-beta and release of interleukin-10 (IL-10), thus involved with the 
      resolution of the inflammation. Its deficiency is associated with the increase of
      disease activity. The active form of VD is 1,25(OH)2D3 that produces biological
      effects via the nuclear hormone receptor named VD receptor (VDR), which may
      interfere with the immune cells and macrophages leading to the suppression of the
      inflammatory process by decreasing the release of TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-6, and
      IL-8, IL-12, and IL-23. VDR may also activate nucleotide-binding oligomerization 
      domain 2 expression and stimulate the production of the defensin and cathelicidin
      that are important to the homeostasis of the mucosal immune barrier. The use of
      VA and VD could be helpful in the treatment and prevention of IBDs but more
      studies are necessary to establish the precise role of these compounds in the
      prevention or remission of these inflammatory processes.

TI  - Development and Application of a Plant-Based Diet Scoring System for Japanese
      Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
PG  - 16-019
LID - 10.7812/TPP/16-019 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Plant-based diets (PBDs) are a healthy alternative to westernized diets.
      A semivegetarian diet, a PBD, has been shown to prevent a relapse in Crohn
      disease. However, there is no way to measure adherence to PBDs. OBJECTIVE: To
      develop a simple way of evaluating adherence to a PBD for Japanese patients with 
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). DESIGN: PBD scores were assigned according to
      the frequency of consumption provided on a food-frequency questionnaire, obtained
      on hospitalization for 159 patients with ulcerative colitis and 70 patients with 
      Crohn disease. Eight items considered to be preventive factors for IBD were
      scored positively, and 8 items considered to be IBD risk factors were scored
      negatively. The PBD score was calculated from the sum of plus and minus scores.
      Higher PBD scores indicated greater adherence to a PBD. The PBD scores were
      evaluated on hospitalization and 2 years after discharge for 22 patients with
      Crohn disease whose dietary pattern and prognosis were established. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURE: Plant-Based Diet score. RESULTS: The PBD scores differed significantly, 
      in descending order, by dietary type: pro-Japanese diet, mixed type, and
      pro-westernized diet (Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis test). The PBD scores in the
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease groups were 10.9 +/- 9.5 and 8.2 +/- 8.2,
      respectively. For patients with Crohn disease, those with long-term remission and
      normal C-reactive protein concentration were significantly more likely to have
      PBD scores of 25 or greater than below 25 (chi(2)). CONCLUSION: The PBD score is 
      a valid assessment of PBD dietary adherence.

TI  - Patients Perceive Clinical Benefit with the Specific Carbohydrate Diet for
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
PG  - 3255-3260
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that dietary therapy may be effective for
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but limited published data exist 
      on the usage and efficacy of dietary therapy. AIM: To evaluate the perspective of
      IBD patients using the specific carbohydrate diet (SCD). METHODS: An anonymous
      online survey was conducted using REDCap, a Web-based survey tool. Survey links
      were sent to known Web sites as well as support groups in an attempt to
      characterize patient utilization of the SCD and perception of efficacy of the
      SCD. RESULTS: There were 417 respondents of the online survey on the SCD with
      IBD. Mean age for individuals on the SCD was 34.9 +/- 16.4 years. Seventy percent
      were female. Forty-seven percent had Crohn's disease, 43 % had ulcerative
      colitis, and 10 % had indeterminate colitis. Individuals perceived clinical
      improvement on the SCD. Four percent reported clinical remission prior to the
      SCD, while 33 % reported remission at 2 months after initiation of the SCD, and
      42 % at both 6 and 12 months. For those reporting clinical remission, 13 %
      reported time to achieve remission of less than 2 weeks, 17 % reported 2 weeks to
      a month, 36 % reported 1-3 months, and 34 % reported greater than 3 months. For
      individuals who reported reaching remission, 47 % of individuals reported
      associated improvement in abnormal laboratory values. CONCLUSIONS: The SCD is
      utilized by many patients as a primary and adjunct therapy for IBD. Most patients
      perceive clinical benefit to use of the SCD.

TI  - Gastrointestinal Symptoms Predictors of Health-Related Quality of Life in
      Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
PG  - e186-e192
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate the multidimensional
      gastrointestinal symptoms predictors of generic health-related quality of life
      (HRQOL) in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease from the
      perspectives of pediatric patients and parents. METHODS: The Pediatric Quality of
      Life Inventory Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales and Pediatric Quality of Life
      Inventory 4.0 Generic Core Scales were completed in a 9-site study by 260
      families of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Gastrointestinal Symptoms
      Scales measuring stomach pain, food and drink limits, gas and bloating,
      constipation, blood in stool, and diarrhea were identified as clinically
      important symptom differentiators from healthy controls based on prior findings, 
      and subsequently tested for bivariate and multivariate linear associations with
      overall HRQOL (Generic Core Scales). RESULTS: Stomach pain, food and drink
      limits, gas and bloating, constipation, blood in stool, and diarrhea were
      significantly associated with decreased HRQOL in bivariate analyses (P < 0.001). 
      In predictive models utilizing hierarchical multiple regression analyses
      controlling for age, sex, and race/ethnicity, gastrointestinal symptoms accounted
      for an additional 40% of the variance in patient self-reported HRQOL (P < 0.001) 
      and 37% of the variance in parent proxy-reported HRQOL (P < 0.001), reflecting
      large effect sizes. Stomach pain, food and drink limits, and constipation were
      significant individual patient-reported predictors after controlling for the
      other gastrointestinal symptoms in the predictive models. CONCLUSIONS:
      Patient-reported gastrointestinal symptoms differentially predicted HRQOL.
      Identifying the specific gastrointestinal symptoms from a standardized
      multidimensional gastrointestinal symptoms profile that are the most important
      predictors from the patient perspective facilitates a patient-centered approach
      for interventions designed to ameliorate impaired HRQOL.

TI  - Preventive health measures in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 7625-44
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i34.7625 [doi]
AB  - We aim to review the literature and provide guidance on preventive health
      measures in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Structured searches were performed 
      in PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Library from January 1976
      to June 2016 using the following keywords: (inflammatory bowel disease OR Crohn's
      disease OR ulcerative colitis) AND (health maintenance OR preventive health OR
      health promotion). Abstracts of the articles selected from each of these multiple
      searches were reviewed, and those meeting the inclusion criteria (that is,
      providing data regarding preventive health or health maintenance in IBD patients)
      were recorded. Reference lists from the selected articles were manually reviewed 
      to identify further relevant studies. Patients with IBD are at increased risk of 
      developing adverse events related to the disease course, therapeutic
      interventions, or non-adherence to medication. Recent studies have suggested that
      IBD patients do not receive preventive services with the same thoroughness as
      patients with other chronic diseases. Preventive health measures can avert
      morbidity and improve the quality of life of patients with IBD.
      Gastroenterologists and primary care physicians (PCPs) should have an up to date 
      working knowledge of preventive health measures for IBD patients. A holistic
      approach and better communication between gastroenterologists and PCPs with
      explicit clarification of roles will prevent duplication of services and
      streamline care.

      creatinine are altered, which prompts the intestinal microflora function/content 
      perturbation as well as kidney function regulation by dictamnus tea.
      Interestingly, our preliminary results showed that a high dose of dictamnus tea
      intake appeared to be toxic for a person with Crohn's disease, since it caused
      high endogenous ethanol excretion in urine. All subjects' metabolic effects
      caused by the dictamnus tea appeared to be reversible, when all volunteers
      stopped its consumption. Finally, we highlight that individuals' metabolic
      phenotype is reflected in their urine biofluid before and after the dictamnus tea
      effect while all individuals have some common and different metabolic responses
      to this tea, implying that each phenotype has a quite different response to this 
      tea consumption.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic pathology that has an outbreaks
      course that in recent years have seen an increase in incidence, especially at
      younger ages. Malnutrition is frequently associated with this condition,
      therefore, it is very important to ensure a right nutritional intervention,
      especially in pediatric patients, to ensure an optimal growth and also an
      improvement in the clinic. Our goal will be updated the role of nutrition in this
      disease and in its treatment based on the published evidence. Malnutrition in
      these patients is frequent and is influenced by various factors such as,
      decreased food intake, increased nutrient requirements, increased protein loss
      and malabsorption of nutrients. Therefore there should be a nutritional
      monitoring of all of them, in which anthropometric measurements, laboratory tests
      and densitometry were made to establish the needs and sufficient caloric intake
      tailored to each patient. The use of enteral nutrition as a treatment in Crohn's 
      disease with mild to moderate outbreak in child population, is amply
      demonstrated, has even shown to be superior to the use of corticosteroids.
      Therefore we can conclude by stressing that nutritional intervention is a
      mainstay in the management of patients with IBD, which aims to prevent and / or
      control disease-related malnutrition to decrease morbidity and mortality and
      improve quality of life.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Exclusive polymeric diet enriched with transforming growth factor-beta
      2 (ANS-TGF-beta2) has been used for remission induction and maintenance in
      pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). Its use in the preoperative setting has never
      been evaluated. The aim of this study was to evaluate preoperative ANS-TGF-beta2 
      to decrease postoperative complications after surgery for complicated ileocolonic
      CD. METHODS: From 2011 to 2015, data of all consecutive patients who underwent
      elective surgery for ileocolonic CD were collected prospectively. Preoperative,
      exclusive ANS-TGF-beta2 was administered in high-risk patients with complicated
      CD. Complicated CD was defined by the presence of obstructive symptoms, and/or
      steroid treatment, and/or preoperative weight loss >10% and/or perforating CD.
      Outcomes of high-risk patients receiving preoperative ANS-TGF-beta2 were compared
      to those of low-risk patients with no complicated CD who underwent upfront
      surgery. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients underwent surgery for ileocolonic CD. Among 
      them, 35 high-risk patients received preoperative ANS-TGF-beta2 and 21 low-risk
      patients underwent upfront surgery. Preoperative full-dose ANS-TGF-beta2 was
      feasible in 34/35 high-risk patients. Discontinuation of steroids during
      preoperative ANS-TGF-beta2 could be achieved in 10/16 patients (62.5%).
      Postoperative complications rates were 8/35 (23.8%) and 5/21 (22.9%) in high-risk
      and low-risk patients, respectively (p = 1). Temporary ileocolostomy rates in
      high-risk patients and in low-risk patients were 4/35 (11%) and 0/21,
      respectively (p = 0.286) Conclusion: Preoperative ANS-TGF-beta2 is feasible in
      most high-risk patients with complicated ileocolonic CD and could limit the
      deleterious effects of risk factors of postoperative morbidity. These results
      need to be confirmed in a large randomized controlled trial.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has become a 'prototype disease' for chronic
      auto-inflammatory disorders with a polygenic background and important
      multifaceted environmental trigger components. The environmental factors
      contribute both to pathogenesis and disease flares. Thus, IBD is a disease par
      excellence to study the interactions between host genetics, environmental factors
      (such as infections or smoking) and 'in-vironmental' factors - for example, our
      intestinal microbiota. Longitudinal intercurrent events, including the impact of 
      long-term medication on disease progression or stabilization, can exemplarily be 
      studied in this disease group. Whilst alterations in the human genome coding
      relevant variant protein products have most likely not emerged significantly over
      the last 50 years, the incidence of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis has
      dramatically increased in Western countries and more recently in the Asia Pacific
      area. An interesting concept indicates that 'Western lifestyle factors' trigger
      chronic intestinal inflammation or disease flares in a genetically susceptible
      host. To understand the disease pathogenesis as well as triggers for flares or
      determinants of disease courses, we must further investigate potential
      en(in)vironmental factors. As environmental conditions, in contrast to genetic
      risk factors, can be influenced, knowledge on those risk factors becomes crucial 
      to modulate disease incidence, disease course or clinical presentation. It is
      obvious that prevention of environmentally triggered disease flares would be a
      goal most relevant for IBD patients. An increased prevalence of IBD in urban
      environment has been documented in Switzerland by the Swiss IBD cohort study.
      Several studies have attempted to identify such factors; however, only a few have
      been validated. The best investigated environmental factor identified in IBD
      cohort analyses is smoking. Other environmental factors that have been associated
      with clinical presentation or risk of inflammatory flares as well as increased
      incidence are diet and food additives. The so-called 'hygiene hypothesis'
      suggests that increased hygiene in childhood associated with reduced exposure to 
      pathogens may leave the mucosal immune system insufficiently trained and thus
      prone to uncontrolled inflammation. Oral contraceptives and non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs are the 2 main classes of frequently taken drugs that
      have been attributed to have the potential to cause flares of the disease. What
      is likely to be the connection between the genetic susceptibility and the
      environmental triggers? There is broad evidence for a critical role of the
      commensal enteric microbiota as a modulator of immunologic responses relevant
      during onset and chronification of IBD.

      Operations for Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjw147 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vedolizumab was recently approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis [UC]
      and Crohn's disease [CD]. No study to date has examined the rate of postoperative
      infectious complications among patients who received vedolizumab in the
      perioperative period. We sought to determine the 30-day postoperative infectious 
      complication rate among inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] patients who received
      vedolizumab within 12 weeks of an abdominal operation as compared to patients who
      received tumour necrosis factor alpha [TNFalpha] inhibitors or no biological
      therapy. METHODS: A retrospective chart review between May 1, 2014 and December
      31, 2015 of adult IBD patients who underwent an abdominal operation was
      performed. The study cohort comprised patients who received vedolizumab within 12
      weeks of their abdominal operation and the control cohorts were patients who
      received TNFalpha inhibitors or no biological therapy. RESULTS: In total, 94
      patients received vedolizumab within 12 weeks of an abdominal operation. Fifty
      experienced postoperative complications [53%], 35 of which were surgical site
      infections [SSIs] [36%]. The vedolizumab group experienced significantly higher
      rates of any postoperative infection [53% vs 33% anti-TNF and 28% non-biologics; 
      p<0.001] and SSI [37% vs 10% and 13%; p<0.001]. On univariate and multivariate
      analysis, exposure to vedolizumab remained a significant predictor of
      postoperative SSI [p<0.001]. CONCLUSIONS: Thirty-seven per cent of IBD patients
      who received vedolizumab within 30 days of a major abdominal operation
      experienced a 30-day postoperative SSI, significantly higher than patients
      receiving TNFalpha inhibitors or no biological therapy. Vedolizumab within 12
      weeks of surgery remained the only predictor of 30-day postoperative SSI on
      multivariate analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As a sulfated polysaccharide, carrageenan has been widely used as
      common food additive. METHODS: In the present study, we investigated the effects 
      of kappa-carrageenan on TNBS-induced gut inflammation in mice. BALB/c mice were
      pretreated with kappa-carrageenan for 14days prior to the administration of TNBS.
      RESULTS: Our results showed that kappa-carrageenan pretreatment aggravated the
      loss of body weight and further increased the mortality rate. Histological and
      morphological analyses revealed that the TNBS-induced colonic inflammation was
      deteriorated by the kappa-carrageenan administration. The ratio of
      CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127dim/CD4(+) of the kappa-carrageenan+TNBS groups was
      significantly lower than that of the TNBS group. The expression of IL-2,
      TNF-alpha and IL-6 was significantly increased, whereas the expression of IL-10
      was significantly decreased in the kappa-carrageenan+TNBS groups. In addition,
      kappa-carrageenan, together with TNBS, decreased the enzyme activity of SOD and
      GSH-px and up-regulated the expression of TLR4, NF-kappaB, p-ERK, p-JNK, p-Jun., 
      IL-8 and MDA in the colonic mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: kappa-Carrageenan aggravated the
      TNBS-induced intestinal inflammation, and such an effect could be associated with
      the oxidative stress and activation of TLR4-NF-kappaB and MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway.

TI  - Novel CD8+ T-Cell Subsets Demonstrating Plasticity in Patients with Inflammatory 
      Bowel Disease.
PG  - 1596-608

AB  - BACKGROUND: Distinct CD8+ T-cell subsets such as interleukin-17-expressing Tc17
      and Foxp3-expressing Tcreg are functionally similar to CD4+ T cells. Though CD4+ 
      T cells are dysregulated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), CD8+ 
      T cells are not well investigated. Vitamin D is an environmental factor which
      influences T-cell subsets. We assessed the prevalence of CD8+ T-cell subsets
      among peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and lamina propria mononuclear
      cells (LPMC) of patients with Crohn's disease, patients with ulcerative colitis, 
      and healthy controls. We then tested the effect of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 
      on CD8+ T-cell subsets. METHODS: A total of 73 patients with Crohn's disease, 49 
      patients with ulcerative colitis, and 47 healthy controls were studied. LPMC or
      PBMC were isolated and flow cytometry was performed. CD3+ T cells, isolated from 
      PBMC, were cultured with or without 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, before flow
      cytometry. RESULTS: In LPMC, the prevalence of Tcreg was higher in patients with 
      IBD (P < 0.05), whereas Tc17 were higher in patients with ulcerative colitis
      compared with patients with Crohn's disease and healthy controls (P < 0.05). In
      PBMC, both Tcreg and Tc17 were higher in patients with IBD (P < 0.01).
      Double-expressing interferon-gamma+ interleukin-17+ and Foxp3+ interleukin-17+
      CD8+ T cells were also identified indicating possible CD8+ plasticity.
      1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 decreased interferon-gamma-expressing Tc1 (P <
      0.05), but had no effect on Tc17 or Tcreg. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of novel
      CD8+ T-cell subsets is altered in patients with IBD. Double-expressing cells
      indicate plasticity and were identified in patients with IBD. Vitamin D may have 
      a limited effect on CD8+ T cells by decreasing interferon-gamma expression.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nutritional status is an important consideration in many
      pediatric clinical conditions. This paper aimed to examine and compare the
      nutritional status, represented by body cell mass (BCM), of children with cancer,
      Crohn's disease (CD), cystic fibrosis (CF) and anorexia nervosa (AN). METHODS:
      Anthropometry was measured and BCM was calculated from whole body potassium-40
      counting in 259 children being treated for clinical conditions (n = 66 cancer; n 
      = 59 AN; n = 75 CF; n = 59 CD) and 108 healthy children. BCM was adjusted for
      height (BCMI) and expressed as a Z-score relative to laboratory reference data.
      RESULTS: The CD (-0.80 +/- 1.61; p = 0.0001) and AN (-1.13 +/- 0.99; p = 0.0001) 
      groups had significantly lower BMI Z-score than the healthy control (0.13 +/-
      0.75), cancer (0.50 +/- 1.40) and CF groups (-0.09 +/- 0.95). The cancer (-1.16
      +/- 1.60; p = 0.0001), CD (-1.13 +/- 1.36; p = 0.0001) and AN (-0.97 +/- 1.18; p 
      = 0.0001) groups had significantly reduced BCM compared to the healthy control
      (0.07 +/- 0.93) and CF group (0.31 +/- 1.08). According to BCMI Z-score, 42.4% of
      patients with cancer, 41.7% of the patients with CD, 27.1% of patients with AN,
      and 4.0% of patients with CF were considered malnourished. CONCLUSIONS: This
      study demonstrates that children undergoing treatment for clinical conditions may
      have alterations in BCM, independent of BMI. Children with cancer, CD and AN all 
      had a high prevalence of malnutrition. Assessment of body composition, not just
      body size, is vital to understand nutritional status in children with clinical
      conditions.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis; Crohn's disease) are
      debilitating relapsing inflammatory disorders affecting the gastrointestinal
      tract, with deleterious effect on quality of life, and increasing incidence and
      prevalence. Mucosal inflammation, due to altered microbiota, increased intestinal
      permeability and immune system dysfunction underlies the symptoms and may be
      caused in susceptible individuals by different factors (or a combination of
      them), including dietary habits and components. In this review we describe the
      influence of the Western diet, obesity, and different nutraceuticals/functional
      foods (bioactive peptides, phytochemicals, omega 3-polyunsaturated fatty acids,
      vitamin D, probiotics and prebiotics) on the course of IBD, and provide some
      hints that could be useful for nutritional guidance. Hopefully, research will
      soon offer enough reliable data to slow down the spread of the disease and to
      make diet a cornerstone in IBD therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous estimates of the economic burden of Crohn's disease (CD)
      varied widely from $2.0 to $18.2 billion per year (adjusted to 2015 $US).
      However, these estimates do not reflect recent changes in pharmaceutical
      treatment options and guidelines. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to update
      cost estimates of Crohn's disease based on a representative sample of the US
      population from the most recent 11 years (2003-2013) of the Medical Expenditure
      Panel Survey (MEPS). A secondary aim described expenditure trends in respondents 
      with and without Crohn's disease pre-post FDA approvals of new biologics and the 
      American College of Gastroenterology Crohn's disease treatment guidelines.
      METHODS: Average annual expenditures (total, prescription, inpatient, and
      outpatient) were evaluated using a pooled cross-sectional design. Respondent data
      from the most recent 11 years (2003-2013) of MEPS were analyzed. Two-part
      generalized linear models with power-link were used to estimate the average
      annual expenditures per patient adjusted to multiple covariates. Confidence
      intervals (CI) were estimated using bootstrap methods. Difference-in-differences 
      estimations were performed to compare the changes in health care expenditures
      pre-post FDA approvals of new biologics and the American College of
      Gastroenterology Crohn's disease treatment guidelines. RESULTS: The annual
      aggregate economic burden of CD was $6.3 billion in the US. Respondents with CD
      had higher total (+$6442; 95% CI: $4864 to $8297), prescription (+$3283; 95% CI: 
      $2289 to $4445), inpatient (+$1764; 95% CI: $748 to $3551), and outpatient
      (+$1191; 95% CI: $592 to $2160) expenditures compared to respondents without CD. 
      In the difference-in-differences estimation, respondents with CD had
      significantly higher total (P = 0.001) and prescription (P < 0.001) expenditures 
      compared with respondents without CD. Although inpatient and outpatient
      expenditures were higher in respondents with CD, they were not statistically
      significant. CONCLUSIONS: Respondents with CD diagnosis had higher expenditures
      compared to respondents without CD diagnosis from 2003 to 2013. This study
      captured the most recent availability of new treatment options and changes to
      treatment guidelines, while providing updated estimates of the economic burden of
      CD in the US. However, this research was unable to study the causes of these
      increased health care expenditures in respondents with CD. Future investigations 
      will need to determine the causal factors for increased expenditures in CD.

AB  - Over the past 20 years, a growing amount of evidence supports the role of
      microbes and an imbalanced microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). While 
      many reviews have been written on the microbiota in IBD, few have considered how 
      they fulfil the Koch's postulates. In this review, we consider how the Koch's
      postulates might be modified so that they can be fulfilled for polymicrobial
      diseases, and we discuss the progress made to date in fulfilling them.

TI  - Auto-brewery Syndrome in the Setting of Long-standing Crohn's Disease: A Case
      Report and Review of the Literature.
PG  - 1448-1450
AB  - CLINICAL BACKGROUND: A 71-year-old male with 50-year history of Crohn's disease
      was evaluated for acute onset of dizziness and slurred speech. Blood ethanol
      levels were elevated despite abstinence from alcohol for over 30 years. CT
      enterography demonstrated massive dilation of the small bowel with anastomotic
      stricture. DISCUSSION: Auto-brewery syndrome may be considered in a patient with 
      chronic obstruction or hypomotility presenting with elevated serum ethanol levels
      in the setting of high carbohydrate intake. Although treatment algorithms lack
      validation, judicious use of antibiotic therapy, carbohydrate control, and short 
      courses of antifungal therapy have all been reported in the literature.
      Importantly, clinical consideration of 'auto-brewery' should be undertaken with
      substantial caution, given the lack of validated mechanisms linking endogenous
      ethanol production to peripheral blood ethanol.

TI  - Dairy Products, Dietary Calcium, and Risk of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Results 
      From a European Prospective Cohort Investigation.
PG  - 1403-11
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000798 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dairy products may be involved in the etiology of inflammatory bowel 
      disease by modulating gut microbiota and immune responses, but data from
      epidemiological studies examining this relationship are limited. We investigated 
      the association between prediagnostic intake of these foods and dietary calcium, 
      and the subsequent development of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis
      (UC). METHODS: In total, 401,326 participants were enrolled in the European
      Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort. At recruitment,
      consumption of total and specific dairy products (milk, yogurt, and cheese) and
      dietary calcium was measured using validated food frequency questionnaires. Cases
      developing incident CD (n = 110) or UC (n = 244) during follow-up were matched
      with 4 controls. Conditional logistic regression analyses were used to calculate 
      odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for total energy 
      intake and smoking. RESULTS: Compared with the lowest quartile, the ORs for the
      highest quartile of total dairy products and dietary calcium intake were 0.61
      (95% CI, 0.32-1.19, p trend = 0.19) and 0.63 (95% CI, 0.28-1.42, p trend = 0.23) 
      for CD, and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.50-1.30, p trend = 0.40) and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.49-1.34,
      p trend = 0.60) for UC, respectively. Compared with nonconsumers, individuals
      consuming milk had significantly reduced odds of CD (OR 0.30, 95% CI, 0.13-0.65) 
      and nonsignificantly reduced odds of UC (OR 0.85, 95% CI, 0.49-1.47).
      CONCLUSIONS: Milk consumption may be associated with a decreased risk of
      developing CD, although a clear dose-response relationship was not established.
      Further studies are warranted to confirm this possible protective effect.

AB  - Survey aims were to investigate the dietary concerns, beliefs and opinions of
      people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and differences between those with 
      Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). A cross-sectional postal
      questionnaire was sent to people with IBD who were booked into an adult IBD or
      Gastroenterology clinic over a 6-week period. There were 416 eligible people and 
      168 (40%) responded. Sixty-four (42%) people indicated that food affects their
      symptoms a lot or severely. Eighty (51%) respondents indicated that diet was
      important or extremely important in controlling symptoms. Significantly more
      people with CD reported meat, fatty foods, chocolate and salad as a trigger than 
      people with UC. Significantly more people with UC reported wheat as a trigger.
      More people with CD avoided meat and chocolate than UC. This survey highlights
      the importance of nutrition and diet to people with IBD. Frequent food avoidance 
      was reported. This may impact on nutrition-related health problems.

TI  - Role of Quantitative Clinical Pharmacology in Pediatric Approval and Labeling.
PG  - 924-33
LID - 10.1124/dmd.116.069559 [doi]
AB  - Dose selection is one of the key decisions made during drug development in
      pediatrics. There are regulatory initiatives that promote the use of model-based 
      drug development in pediatrics. Pharmacometrics or quantitative clinical
      pharmacology enables development of models that can describe factors affecting
      pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics in pediatric patients. This manuscript
      describes some examples in which pharmacometric analysis was used to support
      approval and labeling in pediatrics. In particular, the role of pharmacokinetic
      (PK) comparison of pediatric PK to adults and utilization of
      dose/exposure-response analysis for dose selection are highlighted. Dose
      selection for esomeprazole in pediatrics was based on PK matching to adults,
      whereas for adalimumab, exposure-response, PK, efficacy, and safety data together
      were useful to recommend doses for pediatric Crohn's disease. For vigabatrin,
      demonstration of similar dose-response between pediatrics and adults allowed for 
      selection of a pediatric dose. Based on model-based pharmacokinetic simulations
      and safety data from darunavir pediatric clinical studies with a twice-daily
      regimen, different once-daily dosing regimens for treatment-naive human
      immunodeficiency virus 1-infected pediatric subjects 3 to <12 years of age were
      evaluated. The role of physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling (PBPK) in
      predicting pediatric PK is rapidly evolving. However, regulatory review
      experiences and an understanding of the state of science indicate that there is a
      lack of established predictive performance of PBPK in pediatric PK prediction.
      Moving forward, pharmacometrics will continue to play a key role in pediatric
      drug development contributing toward decisions pertaining to dose selection,
      trial designs, and assessing disease similarity to adults to support
      extrapolation of efficacy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Barwon area in Australia has one of the highest incidence rates
      of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and therefore is an ideal location to study
      the impact of environmental exposures on the disease's development. AIM: To study
      these exposures prior to the development of IBD in a population-based cohort.
      METHOD: One hundred and thirty-two incident cases (81 Crohn disease (CD) and 51
      ulcerative colitis (UC)) from an IBD registry and 104 controls replied to the
      International Organization of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases environmental
      questionnaire. This included 87 questions about pre-illness exposures that
      included childhood illnesses, vaccinations, breastfeeding, house amenities, pets 
      and swimming, diet and smoking. RESULTS: The factors associated with CD included 
      smoking (odds ratio (OR): 1.42, confidence interval (CI): 1-2.02, P = 0.029);
      childhood events, including tonsillectomy (OR: 1.74, CI: 1.15-2.6, P = 0.003) and
      chicken pox infection (OR: 3.89, CI: 1.61-9.4, P = 0.005) and pre-diagnosis
      intake of frequent fast food (OR: 2.26, CI: 1.76-4.33, P = 0.003). In UC, the
      risk factors included smoking (OR: 1.39, CI: 1.1-1.92, P = 0.026) and
      pre-diagnosis intake of frequent fast food (OR: 2.91, CI: 1.54-5.58, P < 0.001), 
      and high caffeine intake was protective (OR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.3-0.87, P = 0.002). 
      Other protective exposures for UC included high fruit intake (OR: 0.59, CI:
      0.4-0.88, P = 0.003) and having pets as a child (OR: 0.36, CI: 0.2-0.79, P =
      0.001). CONCLUSION: This first Australian population-based study of environmental
      risk factors confirms that smoking, childhood immunological events and dietary
      factors play a role in IBD development; while high caffeine intake and pet
      ownership offer a protective effect.

AB  - Therapeutic manipulation of gut microbiota has proven valuable in the management 
      of ulcerative colitis and pouchitis. Despite some similarities among the various 
      inflammatory bowel conditions, the probiotics investigated thus far seem to
      confer little benefit in Crohn's disease. In this review, we aim to bring
      together the evidence available on the clinical effect of probiotics and
      prebioltics in Crohn's disease patients, and to clarify the place of probiotic
      treatment in current Crohn's therapeutic regimens.

TI  - Comparison of the Efficacies of Parenteral Iron Sucrose and Oral Iron Sulfate for
      Anemic Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Korea.
PG  - 562-8
LID - 10.5009/gnl15373 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The optimal route for iron administration in anemic patients
      with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has not been determined. The aim of this
      study was to compare the efficacies of parenteral and oral iron therapy in IBD
      patients in Korea. METHODS: A retrospective multicenter study was performed.
      Patients who had been administered parenteral iron were matched to the controls
      with oral iron at a 1:1 ratio according to age, sex, and type of IBD. RESULTS:
      Patients that received parenteral iron exhibited increases in hemoglobin levels
      of >/=20% from the baseline at lower doses and in shorter durations (p=0.034 and 
      p=0.046, respectively). In the multivariate analysis, parenteral iron therapy
      appeared to be more efficient than oral iron therapy, but this difference was not
      statistically significant (hazard ratio [HR], 1.552; 95% confidence interval
      [CI], 0.844 to 2.851; p=0.157). Patients with ulcerative colitis responded better
      to iron therapy than those with Crohn's disease (HR, 3.415; 95% CI, 1.808 to
      6.450; p<0.001). Patients with an initial hemoglobin level of 10 g/dL or higher
      responded poorly to iron therapy (HR, 0.345; 95% CI, 0.177 to 0.671; p=0.002).
      CONCLUSIONS: Parenteral iron therapy appears to be more efficient than oral iron 
      therapy. Physicians should focus on the iron deficiency of IBD patients and
      consider parenteral iron supplements in appropriate patient groups.

TI  - Up regulation of glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR) is
      associated with intestinal epithelial cells apoptosis in TNBS-induced
      experimental colitis.

AB  - Glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR), which exists mainly in
      the liver, is a D-2-hydroxy-acid dehydrogenase that plays a critical role in the 
      formation of primary hyperoxaluria type 2 (PH2). Here, we investigated GRHPR
      expression and its potential role in both human Crohn's disease (CD) and
      experimental colitis. Murine experimental colitis models were established by
      administration of trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS). As shown by Western blot,
      significant up-regulation of GRHPR was found in TNBS-treated mice as compared
      with normal controls. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) also showed increased GRHPR
      expression, and the molecule was located in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs).
      This phenomenon also occurred in patients with Crohn's disease. Besides, in an in
      vitro study, human IEC line HT-29 cells cultured with tumor necrosis factor alpha
      (TNF-alpha) were used to evaluate the changes in expression of GRHPR. Moreover,
      overexpression of GRHPR was accompanied by active caspase-3 and cleaved poly
      ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) accumulation. Furthermore, knock-down GRHPR could
      inhibit the accumulation of active caspase-3 and cleaved PARP as shown by Western
      blot in TNF-alpha treated HT-29 cells. Flow cytometry assay indicated that
      interference of GRHPR led to increasing apoptosis of IECs. These data suggested
      that GRHPR might exert its pro-apoptosis function in IECs. Thus, GRHPR might play
      an important role in regulating IECs apoptosis, and might be a potential
      therapeutic target for CD.

LID - 10.1159/000443012 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by inflammatory reactions,
      complications, extraintestinal manifestations and a loss of intestinal functions,
      for example, failures of absorption and secretion. According to intestinal
      dysfunction, a wide array of pathogenetic pathways is existing leading to iron
      deficiency and numerous vitamins as well as trace element deficiencies.
      Complications, symptoms and signs of those deficiencies are common in IBD with
      varying degrees of clinical significance. This review focuses on selected
      micronutrients including iron, zinc, magnesium and some vitamins. Epidemiology
      with respect to IBD, pathophysiology, diagnosis and clinical aspects are
      addressed. Finally, some suggestions for treatment of deficient situations are
      discussed. In conclusion, some micronutrients have significant impact on
      complications and quality of life in IBD. Deficiencies may even influence the
      course of the disease. Those deficiencies should be thoroughly supplemented.

AB  - Since World War II, several factors such as an impressive industrial growth, an
      enhanced environmental bioavailability and intensified food consumption have
      contributed to a significant amplification of human exposure to aluminum.
      Aluminum is particularly present in food, beverages, some drugs and airbone dust.
      In our food, aluminum is superimposed via additives and cooking utensils.
      Therefore, the tolerable intake of aluminum is exceeded for a significant part of
      the world population, especially in children who are more vulnerable to toxic
      effects of pollutants than adults. Faced with this oral aluminum influx,
      intestinal tract is an essential barrier, especially as 38% of ingested aluminum 
      accumulates at the intestinal mucosa. Although still poorly documented to date,
      the impact of oral exposure to aluminum in conditions relevant to real human
      exposure appears to be deleterious for gut homeostasis. Aluminum ingestion
      affects the regulation of the permeability, the microflora and the immune
      function of intestine. Nowadays, several arguments are consistent with an
      involvement of aluminum as an environmental risk factor for inflammatory bowel
      diseases.

      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 266-73
LID - 10.1111/imj.13003 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases are thought to develop as a result of dysregulation
      of the relationship that exists between the gut microbiota, host genetics and the
      immune system. The advent of culture-independent techniques has revolutionised
      the ability to characterise the role of the gut microbiota in health and disease 
      based on the microbiota's genetic make-up. Inflammatory bowel diseases are
      characterised by dysbiosis which is an imbalance between pro- and
      anti-inflammatory bacteria and a reduction in bacterial diversity. Emerging data 
      suggest that it is not only the presence of the gut microbiota but the functional
      activity of the microbiota that appears to play an important role in health and
      disease. Current strategies to manipulate therapeutically the gut microbiota
      using dietary modification, prebiotics, probiotics, antibiotics and faecal
      microbiota transplantation aim to restore the balance to a state of normobiosis. 
      However, the ability of such strategies to correct dysbiosis and thereby achieve 
      therapeutic benefit is yet to be fully characterised.

TI  - Towards an integrated understanding of the therapeutic utility of exclusive
      enteral nutrition in the treatment of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1741-51
LID - 10.1039/c5fo01196e [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic disease characterized by episodic and disabling
      inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract in genetically susceptible
      individuals. The incidence and prevalence of CD is rising rapidly across the
      world emphasising that disease risk is also influenced by environmental and
      lifestyle factors, as well as the microbial community resident in the gut.
      Childhood-onset CD is associated with an aggressive disease course that can
      adversely impact patient growth and development. There is no cure for CD however 
      new onset and recurrent cases of paediatric CD are often responsive to exclusive 
      enteral nutrition (EEN) treatment. EEN treatment involves the exclusive
      consumption of an elemental or polymeric formula for several weeks and it is well
      established as a primary intervention strategy. EEN treatments typically achieve 
      remission rates of over 80% and importantly they are associated with a high rate 
      of mucosal healing, far superior to steroids, which is prognostic of improved
      long-term health outcomes. Furthermore, they are safe, have few side effects, and
      improve nutritional status and linear growth. Surprisingly, despite the utility
      of EEN our understanding of the host-microbe-diet interactions that underpin
      clinical remission and mucosal healing are limited. Here, we review the current
      state of knowledge and propose that the induction of autophagy, in addition to
      modulation of the microbiota and coordinated effects on inflammation and
      epithelial cell biology, may be critical for the therapeutic effects associated
      with EEN. A better understanding of EEN treatment will provide new opportunities 
      to restore gut homeostasis and prolong periods of remission, as well as provide
      new insights into the factors that trigger and perhaps prevent CD.

TI  - Vitamin D supplementation in inflammatory bowel disease: the role of dosage and
      patient compliance.
PG  - 148-51
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Vitamin D substitution is recommended in patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease. Specific guidelines are lacking. The aim of this study was to
      assess the effect of vitamin D supplementation with respect to dosage and patient
      compliance. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of 167 Crohn disease/ulcerative
      colitis outpatients. Patients were screened for serum vitamin D (25OHD2+3) at the
      end of summer and in late winter. Demographic data, history of vitamin D
      supplementation were recorded and matched with prescription records. RESULTS: A
      total of 57 subjects used vitamin D supplementation (mean dose 1104 IU/day).
      25OHD2+3 levels were lower (p < 0.001) in winter both in substituted and
      unsubstituted group, without any differences between groups within the same
      season. 25OHD2+3 levels did not correlate with the substitution dose. 52.1 % of
      subjects were fully compliant with substitution. 25OHD2+3 and prevalence of
      vitamin D deficit in this group were comparable with unsubstituted subjects
      except a higher prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency (p < 0.02). CONCLUSION:
      Fixed dosage of 1100 IU/day of vitamin D was insufficient to correct the
      deficiency. Patient compliance with vitamin D supplementation was low, however
      this fact did not significantly contribute to the degree of vitamin D deficiency 
      in this dosage (Tab. 3, Fig. 1, Ref. 21).

TI  - Food Intake Adequacy in Children and Adolescents With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
PG  - 437-44
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000001170 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Diet assessment is essential in the care of patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We aimed to study food intake in children with 
      IBD and evaluated the relation of dietary intake with disease activity and
      nutritional status in these children. METHODS: This cross-sectional study
      investigated 68 children and adolescents with IBD (57 Crohn disease, 11
      ulcerative colitis). Evaluation included clinical, laboratory, and nutritional
      assessment including 3 days diet record. RESULTS: Compared with recommended daily
      allowance, the intake of patients with IBD was significantly poor for
      carbohydrates (75%, P = 0.016), calcium (49%, P < 0.05), magnesium (76%, P <
      0.05), vitamin A (72%, P < 0.05), vitamin E (57%, P < 0.05), and fiber (44%, P < 
      0.05) and higher for protein (175%, P < 0.05), iron (112%, P < 0.05), and
      water-soluble vitamins (118%-189% P < 0.05). Compared with the intakes of healthy
      children from National Nutritional Survey, the intake of IBD group was lower for 
      calories (78%, P = 0.012), carbohydrates (61% P < 0.05), magnesium (67% P <
      0.05), vitamin C (34%, P < 0.05), and fiber (54%, P < 0.05) and high for B12
      (141%, P < 0.05). Fifty subjects ate ordinary diets, 7 of 68 children were on
      exclusive enteral nutrition and 11 of 68 consumed regular food with different
      polymeric formulas supplements. Compared with children without supplements,
      children on exclusive enteral nutrition and nutritional supplements (18/68) had
      significantly better intakes of energy (1870 +/- 755 vs 2267 +/- 432, P < 0.05), 
      carbohydrates (223 +/- 97 vs 292 +/- 99, P < 0.05), and all minerals (P < 0.05)
      and micronutrients (P < 0.05). Dietary intake was not different by disease status
      (remission or relapse). CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of nutritional supplements,
      food intake is inadequate for many nutrients in many children with IBD.

LID - 10.1136/bcr-2015-213584 [doi]
LID - bcr2015213584 [pii]
AB  - Burkholderia ginsengisoli is a non-pathogenic Gram-negative bacterium that
      ordinarily serves as a plant endosymbiont. We report the first case of human
      infection with B. ginsengisoli presenting as bacteraemia in a young man with
      severe Crohn's disease. Definitive identification of the pathogen could not be
      accomplished with conventional techniques and required DNA sequencing. The
      bacteraemia may have been related to ingestion of organic vegetables and
      compromised gastrointestinal mucosa, coupled with treatment with tumour necrosis 
      factor alpha inhibitors. Although there are no standard antibiotics to treat this
      pathogen, we devised a successful treatment regimen.

TI  - Diet therapy for inflammatory bowel diseases: The established and the new.
PG  - 2179-94
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i7.2179 [doi]
AB  - Although patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have a strong interest
      in dietary modifications as part of their therapeutic management, dietary advice 
      plays only a minor part in published guidelines. The scientific literature shows 
      that dietary factors might influence the risk of developing IBD, that dysbiosis
      induced by nutrition contributes to the pathogenesis of IBD, and that diet may
      serve as a symptomatic treatment for irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms in
      IBD. The role of nutrition in IBD is underscored by the effect of various dietary
      therapies. In paediatric patients with Crohn's disease (CD) enteral nutrition
      (EN) reaches remission rates similar to steroids. In adult patients, however, EN 
      is inferior to corticosteroids. EN is not effective in ulcerative colitis (UC).
      Total parenteral nutrition in IBD is not superior to steroids or EN. The use of
      specific probiotics in patients with IBD can be recommended only in special
      clinical situations. There is no evidence for efficacy of probiotics in CD. By
      contrast, studies in UC have shown a beneficial effect in selected patients. For 
      patients with pouchitis, antibiotic treatment followed by probiotics, like VSL#3 
      or Lactobacillus GG, is effective. When probiotics are used, the risk of
      bacterial translocation and subsequent bacteremia has to be considered. More
      understanding of the normal intestinal microflora, and better characterization of
      probiotic strains at the phenotypic and genomic levels is needed as well as
      clarification of the mechanisms of action in different clinical settings. A
      FODMAP reduced diet may improve symptoms in IBD.

      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 2111-7
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i6.2111 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To investigate the specific carbohydrate diet (SCD) as nutritional therapy
      for maintenance of remission in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS:
      Retrospective chart review was conducted in 11 pediatric patients with CD who
      initiated the SCD as therapy at time of diagnosis or flare. Two groups defined as
      SCD simple (diet alone, antibiotics or 5-ASA) or SCD with immunomodulators
      (corticosteroids and/or stable thiopurine dosing) were followed for one year and 
      compared on disease characteristics, laboratory values and anthropometrics.
      RESULTS: The mean age at start of the SCD was 11.8 +/- 3.0 years (range 6.6-17.6 
      years) with five patients starting the SCD within 5 wk of diagnosis. Three
      patients maintained a strict SCD diet for the study period and the mean time for 
      liberalization was 7.7 +/- 4.0 mo (range 1-12) for the remaining patients. In
      both groups, hematocrit, albumin and ESR values improved while on strict SCD and 
      appeared stable after liberalization (P-value 0.006, 0.002, 0.002 respectively). 
      The majority of children gained in weight and height percentile while on strict
      SCD, with small loss in weight percentile documented with liberalization.
      CONCLUSION: Disease control may be attainable with the SCD in pediatric CD.
      Further studies are needed to assess adherence, impact on mucosal healing and
      growth.

      major physiological functions of GI mast cells comprise of - as far as we know - 
      regulation of GI functions, namely epithelial and endothelial functions,
      crosstalk with the enteric nervous system, and contribution to the host defense
      against bacterial, viral and parasitic agents. A number of chronic GI diseases,
      including inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis),
      celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and food allergies, are thought to be
      associated with mast cell hyperplasia and humoral activity. Clinical conditions
      characterized by a decrease in mast cell functionality are not known so far. In
      the present review, we summarize current evidence which show that human mast
      cells play a central role at the GI barrier, both in health and disease.

TI  - Oral versus intravenous iron replacement therapy distinctly alters the gut
      microbiota and metabolome in patients with IBD.
PG  - 863-871

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Iron deficiency is a common complication in patients with IBD and oral
      iron therapy is suggested to exacerbate IBD symptoms. We performed an
      open-labelled clinical trial to compare the effects of per oral (PO) versus
      intravenous (IV) iron replacement therapy (IRT). DESIGN: The study population
      included patients with Crohn's disease (CD; N=31), UC (N=22) and control subjects
      with iron deficiency (non-inflamed, NI=19). After randomisation, participants
      received iron sulfate (PO) or iron sucrose (IV) over 3 months. Clinical
      parameters, faecal bacterial communities and metabolomes were assessed before and
      after intervention. RESULTS: Both PO and IV treatments ameliorated iron
      deficiency, but higher ferritin levels were observed with IV. Changes in disease 
      activity were independent of iron treatment types. Faecal samples in IBD were
      characterised by marked interindividual differences, lower phylotype richness and
      proportions of Clostridiales. Metabolite analysis also showed separation of both 
      UC and CD from control anaemic participants. Major shifts in bacterial diversity 
      occurred in approximately half of all participants after IRT, but patients with
      CD were most susceptible. Despite individual-specific changes in phylotypes due
      to IRT, PO treatment was associated with decreased abundances of operational
      taxonomic units assigned to the species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii,
      Ruminococcus bromii, Dorea sp. and Collinsella aerofaciens. Clear IV-specific and
      PO-specific fingerprints were evident at the level of metabolomes, with changes
      affecting cholesterol-derived host substrates. CONCLUSIONS: Shifts in gut
      bacterial diversity and composition associated with iron treatment are pronounced
      in IBD participants. Despite similar clinical outcome, oral administration
      differentially affects bacterial phylotypes and faecal metabolites compared with 
      IV therapy. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: clinicaltrial.gov (NCT01067547).

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Inconsistent findings have been published regarding vitamin D status 
      among patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and the association with disease
      severity. We aimed to perform a meta-analysis evaluating serum 25-hydroxy vitamin
      D and 1,25 dehydroxyvitamin D among CD patients compared with healthy and
      non-healthy controls, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, and the association
      with disease. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, SCOPUS, EMBASE, and Google Scholar up
      to March 2015 for observational studies assessing serum vitamin D levels in CD
      patients. A total of 63 studies were included in the following four
      meta-analyses: 1) a meta-analysis on the mean difference of 25(OH)D levels in CD 
      patients compared with healthy (number of studies = 27) and non-healthy (n = 25) 
      controls; 2) a meta-analysis on the mean difference of 1,25(OH)2 D3 levels in CD 
      patients compared with healthy (n = 7) and non-healthy (n = 8) controls; 3) a
      meta-analysis on the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (n = 34); 4) a
      meta-analysis on the correlation coefficients between vitamin D status severity
      of CD (n = 6). Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were used to discover
      possible sources of between-study heterogeneity. RESULTS: It was found that CD
      patients had lower levels of 25(OH)D compared with healthy (-3.99 ng/mL; 95%
      confidence interval [CI]: -5.91 to -2.08) but not non-healthy controls (-1.07
      ng/mL; 95% CI: -2.84 to 0.70). There was also no significant mean difference for 
      1,25(OH)2 D3 for both healthy and non-healthy controls. Meta-analysis on the
      prevalence of vitamin D deficiency showed an overall prevalence of 57.7% (95% CI:
      0.502-0.649). An inverse association was observed between serum vitamin D and
      severity of CD (-0.36; 95% CI: -0.48 to -0.24). Meta-regression showed that mean 
      levels of 25(OH)D were decreased 0.09 for each unit change of latitude among CD
      patients compared with healthy controls (B = -0.09, P = 0.004, I(2) residual =
      86.08%). CONCLUSIONS: We found that patients with Crohn's disease had lower serum
      25(OH)D concentrations compared with their healthy counterparts, and more than
      half of them have hypovitaminosis D. Moreover, there was an inverse correlation
      between circulating 25(OH)D concentrations and severity of Crohn's disease.

PG  - 263-73

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Anti-integrin therapy for the treatment of patients with Crohn's
      disease is rapidly evolving. Two agents, natalizumab and vedolizumab, are
      approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of
      Crohn's disease, with vedolizumab the primary anti-integrin used due to a more
      favorable safety profile. Several other anti-integrins are in various stages of
      development. AREAS COVERED: This review discusses the current state of
      anti-integrin therapy as well as suggestions for positioning of these agents in
      clinical practice. Emerging anti-integrin therapies, their underlying mechanisms 
      of action, and available safety and clinical data are also reviewed. EXPERT
      OPINION: Anti-integrins are effective for the treatment of Crohn's disease, even 
      in patients refractory to other therapies. Their use should be considered in
      patients with Crohn's disease who do not respond to, develop non-response to, or 
      have contraindications to anti-TNF therapy. Anti-integrin therapies can be
      offered as a first biologic therapy, in particular for older patients, patients
      with concurrent multiple sclerosis (natalizumab only), and in patients with
      contraindications to anti-TNF therapy. In patients with more severe symptoms,
      providers should consider co-induction with corticosteroids if possible to hasten
      remission.

TI  - Treatment of Crohn's Disease with an IgG4-Guided Exclusion Diet: A Randomized
      Controlled Trial.
PG  - 1148-57
LID - 10.1007/s10620-015-3987-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: We previously reported an improvement in symptoms in Crohn's 
      disease following an IgG4-guided exclusion diet in an open-label study. We aimed 
      to evaluate, in a double-blinded randomized sham-controlled setting, the efficacy
      of IgG4-guided diet in improving quality of life in patients with Crohn's
      disease. METHODS: Consecutive patients with Crohn's disease and a Crohn's disease
      activity index (CDAI) of 80-400 attending tertiary and secondary care centers
      were screened. All patients had IgG4 titers tested against 16 common food types
      using ELISA. The true diet group excluded four food types with the highest
      antibody titers for 4 weeks, and the sham group excluded four foods with the
      lowest antibody titers. Quality of life was assessed using the Short Inflammatory
      Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ) at beginning and end of the trial. Secondary 
      outcome measures were CDAI, Harvey Bradshaw index, serum C-reactive protein, and 
      fecal calprotectin. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-five subjects were screened
      and 96 subjects had initial food antibody testing performed with 76 patients
      completing the study. Milk, beef, pork and egg were the most commonly excluded
      food types in the true diet group. There was a 3.05 (0.01-6.11) p < 0.05
      improvement in SIBDQ and 41 (10.4-71.5) in CDAI p = 0.009. CONCLUSION:
      IgG4-guided exclusion diet, as an adjunct, can improve quality of life and
      symptoms in patients with CD.

TI  - Therapeutic Potential to Modify the Mucus Barrier in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
LID - 10.3390/nu8010044 [doi]
LID - E44 [pii]
AB  - Recently, numerous studies have shown that disruption of the mucus barrier plays 
      an important role in the exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease, particularly
      in ulcerative colitis. Alterations in the mucus barrier are well supported by
      published data and are widely accepted. The use of fluorescence in situ
      hybridization and Carnoy's fixation has revealed the importance of the mucus
      barrier in maintaining a mutualistic relationship between host and bacteria.
      Studies have raised the possibility that modulation of the mucus barrier may
      provide therapies for the disease, using agents such as short-chain fatty acids, 
      prebiotics and probiotics. This review describes changes in the mucus barrier of 
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease and in animal models of the disease. We 
      also review the involvement of the mucus barrier in the exacerbation of the
      disease and explore the therapeutic potential of modifying the mucus barrier with
      short-chain fatty acids, prebiotics, probiotics, fatty acid synthase, H(2)S,
      neutrophil elastase inhibitor and phophatidyl choline.

TI  - Avoidance of Fiber Is Associated With Greater Risk of Crohn's Disease Flare in a 
      6-Month Period.
PG  - 1130-6
LID - 10.1016/j.cgh.2015.12.029 [doi]
LID - S1542-3565(15)01713-9 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) have been
      associated with an abnormal mucosal response to the gastrointestinal microbiota. 
      Although dietary fiber affects the gastrointestinal microbiota, there is limited 
      information on the role of fiber on IBD activity. We investigated factors
      associated with fiber consumption and whether it was associated with flares in
      patients with IBD. METHODS: We collected a completed 26-item dietary survey from 
      1619 participants in the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America Partners
      Internet cohort (Crohn's disease, 1130; ulcerative colitis/indeterminate colitis,
      489). Eligible individuals were in remission based on disease activity index at
      baseline and completed a follow-up survey 6 months later. Fiber and whole grain
      consumption were categorized into quartiles and deciles. Disease flare at 6
      months was defined as a disease activity index score exceeding remission cutoff
      values, and/or an IBD-related surgical procedure or hospitalization since
      baseline. RESULTS: Participants with longer duration of disease, past history of 
      surgery, and past IBD hospitalization ate less fiber. The risks for disease flare
      differed by disease type. Compared with those in the lowest quartile of fiber
      consumption, participants with Crohn's disease in the highest quartile were less 
      likely to have a flare (adjusted odds ratios [OR], 0.58; 95% confidence interval 
      [CI], 0.37-0.90). Participants with Crohn's disease who reported that they did
      not avoid high-fiber foods were approximately 40% less likely to have a disease
      flare than those who avoided high-fiber foods (adjusted OR, 0.59; 95% CI,
      0.43-0.81). There was no association between fiber intake and flares in patients 
      with ulcerative colitis (adjusted OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 0.92-3.60). CONCLUSIONS:
      Intake of dietary fiber is associated with reduced disease flares in patients
      with Crohn's disease, but not UC. Recommendations to limit dietary fiber should
      be re-evaluated.

TI  - Western diet induces a shift in microbiota composition enhancing susceptibility
      to Adherent-Invasive E. coli infection and intestinal inflammation.
PG  - 19032
LID - 10.1038/srep19032 [doi]
AB  - Recent advances have shown that the abnormal inflammatory response observed in CD
      involves an interplay among intestinal microbiota, host genetics and
      environmental factors. The escalating consumption of fat and sugar in Western
      countries parallels an increased incidence of CD during the latter 20(th)
      century. The impact of a HF/HS diet in mice was evaluated for the gut
      micro-inflammation, intestinal microbiota composition, function and selection of 
      an E. coli population. The HF/HS diet created a specific inflammatory environment
      in the gut, correlated with intestinal mucosa dysbiosis characterized by an
      overgrowth of pro-inflammatory Proteobacteria such as E. coli, a decrease in
      protective bacteria, and a significantly decreased of SCFA concentrations. The
      expression of GPR43, a SCFA receptor was reduced in mice treated with a HF/HS
      diet and reduced in CD patients compared with controls. Interestingly, mice
      treated with an agonist of GPR43 were protected against DSS-induced colitis.
      Finally, the transplantation of feces from HF/HS treated mice to GF mice
      increased susceptibility to AIEC infection. Together, our results demonstrate
      that a Western diet could aggravate the inflammatory process and that the
      activation of the GPR43 receptor pathway could be used as a new strategy to treat
      CD patients.

TI  - Dietary Patterns and Risk of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Europe: Results from
      the EPIC Study.
PG  - 345-54
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000638 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Specific nutrients or foods have been inconsistently associated with 
      ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) risks. Thus, we investigated
      associations between diet as a whole, as dietary patterns, and UC and CD risks.
      METHODS: Within the prospective EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into
      Cancer) study, we set up a nested matched case-control study among 366,351
      participants with inflammatory bowel disease data, including 256 incident cases
      of UC and 117 of CD, and 4 matched controls per case. Dietary intake was recorded
      at baseline from validated food frequency questionnaires. Incidence rate ratios
      of developing UC and CD were calculated for quintiles of the Mediterranean diet
      score and a posteriori dietary patterns produced by factor analysis. RESULTS: No 
      dietary pattern was associated with either UC or CD risks. However, when
      excluding cases occurring within the first 2 years after dietary assessment,
      there was a positive association between a "high sugar and soft drinks" pattern
      and UC risk (incidence rate ratios for the fifth versus first quintile, 1.68
      [1.00-2.82]; Ptrend = 0.02). When considering the foods most associated with the 
      pattern, high consumers of sugar and soft drinks were at higher UC risk only if
      they had low vegetables intakes. CONCLUSIONS: A diet imbalance with high
      consumption of sugar and soft drinks and low consumption of vegetables was
      associated with UC risk. Further studies are needed to investigate whether
      microbiota alterations or other mechanisms mediate this association.

      inflammatory bowel disease.

AB  - Treatment of inflammatory bowel disease has significantly improved since the
      introduction of biological agents, such as infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab
      pegol, and golimumab. The Food and Drug Administration has classified these
      factors in category B, which means that they do not demonstrate a fetal risk.
      However, during pregnancy fetuses are exposed to high anti-tumor necrosis factor 
      (TNF) levels that are measurable in their plasma after birth. Since antibodies
      can transfer through the placenta at the end of the second and during the third
      trimesters, it is important to know the safety profile of these drugs,
      particularly for the fetus, and whether maintaining relapse of the disease
      compensates for the potential risks of fetal exposure. The limited data available
      for the anti-TNF drugs to date have not demonstrated any significant adverse
      outcomes in the pregnant women who continued their therapy from conception to the
      first trimester of gestation. However, data suggest that anti-TNFs should be
      discontinued during the third trimester, as they may affect the immunological
      system of the newborn baby. Each decision should be individualized, based on the 
      distinct characteristics of the patient and her disease. Considering all the
      above, there is a need for more clinical studies regarding the effect of anti-TNF
      therapeutic agents on pregnancy outcomes.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic illness of unknown etiology. The 
      consequences that CD causes nutritionally depend on several factors. However,
      little is known about the nutritional practices that CD affected people adopt
      once diagnosed. OBJECTIVE: to explore the experience of those affected in
      relation to food intake, with the future goal of understanding those experiences 
      and design effective and appropriate interventions. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: a
      qualitative design based on ethnographic approach was used. 19 semi-structured
      interviews were conducted in Alicante, until data saturation was reached and
      later the analysis of categories and subcategories was developed. RESULTS: 5
      categories with their subcategories were identified from the data collected on
      the experience of feeding: 1) Beliefs about nutrition and CD, 2) Changing eating 
      habits, 3) Finding information about food and CD, 4) The role of professionals,
      5) Self-management. CONCLUSIONS: knowledge of the dietary habits of the person
      with CD, may provide professional workforce with the appropriate information for 
      management and support in terms of prevention, health promotion and health
      education, useful for the organization of health institutions, where those things
      are not usually taken into account since the CD approach is purely based on
      clinical and pathological aspects. Consequently, it appears a need of a new CD
      perspective based on health, focused on promoting healthy habits and from a
      multidisciplinary approach.

TI  - Mucosal Barrier Depletion and Loss of Bacterial Diversity are Primary
      Abnormalities in Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis.
PG  - 462-71
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv223 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ulcerative colitis [UC] is associated with colonic mucosa
      barrier defects and bacterial dysbiosis, but these features may simply be the
      result of inflammation. Therefore, we sought to assess whether these features are
      inherently abrogated in the terminal ileum [TI] of UC patients, where
      inflammation is absent. METHODS: TI biopsies from paediatric inflammatory bowel
      disease [IBD] subsets [Crohn's disease [CD; n = 13] and UC [n = 10]], and non-IBD
      disease controls [n = 12] were histologically graded, and alcian blue/periodic
      acid-Schiff stained biopsies were quantified. The mucosal barrier was assessed
      for mucin [MUC2], immunoglobulin [Ig]A, IgG, and total bacteria (fluorescence
      in-situ hybridisation [FISH probe EUB338]) by immunofluorescence. The regulation 
      of mucin secretion was investigated by NLRP6 gene expression and
      immunofluorescence. The composition of the active mucosa-associated microbiota
      was explored by sequencing the 16S rRNA amplicon generated from total RNA.
      RESULTS: Despite the absence of ileitis, UC patients displayed ileal barrier
      depletion illustrated by reductions in mucin-containing goblet cells and mucin
      production and altered epithelial NLRP6 expression. In both CD patients with
      ileitis and UC patients with normal histology, bacteria coated with IgA and IgG
      penetrated the TI mucin layer. Biopsy 16S rRNA sequencing revealed a reduction in
      alpha-diversity by three methods [Shannon, Simpson, and Equitability indices]
      between UC and non-IBD paediatric patients. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest
      an underlying defect in the UC-afflicted intestinal tract even in the absence of 
      inflammation, implicating barrier and microbial changes as primary abnormalities 
      in UC that may play a causative role in disease development.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Despite dietary factors being implicated in the pathogenesis of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), nutritional therapy, outside of exclusive
      enteral nutrition (EEN), has not had a defined role within the treatment paradigm
      of pediatric IBD within IBD centers. Based on emerging data, Seattle Children's
      Hospital IBD Center has developed an integrated dietary program incorporating the
      specific carbohydrate diet (SCD) into its treatment paradigm. This treatment
      paradigm uses the SCD as primary therapy as well as adjunctive therapy for the
      treatment of IBD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential effects of 
      the SCD on clinical outcomes and laboratory studies of pediatric patients with
      Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: In this retrospective 
      study, we reviewed the medical records of patients with IBD on SCD. RESULTS: We
      analyzed 26 children on the SCD: 20 with CD and 6 with UC. Duration of the
      dietary therapy ranged from 3 to 48 mo. In patients with active CD (Pediatric
      Crohn's Disease activity index [PCDAI] >10), PCDAI dropped from 32.8 +/- 13.2 at 
      baseline to 20.8 +/- 16.6 by 4 +/- 2 wk, and to 8.8 +/- 8.5 by 6 mo. The mean
      Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index for patients with active UC decreased
      from a baseline of 28.3 +/- 10.3 to 20.0 +/- 17.3 at 4 +/- 2 wk, to 18.3 +/- 31.7
      at 6 mo. CONCLUSION: This retrospective review provides evidence that the SCD can
      be integrated into a tertiary care center and may improve clinical and laboratory
      parameters for pediatric patients with nonstructuring, nonpenetrating CD as well 
      as UC. Further prospective studies are needed to fully assess the safety and
      efficacy of the SCD in pediatric patients with IBD.

TI  - A snapshot of the nutritional status of Crohn's disease among adolescents in
      Brazil: a prospective cross-sectional study.
PG  - 172
LID - 10.1186/s12876-015-0403-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between nutrition and Crohn's disease (CD) is
      complex and involves several therapeutic possibilities including: nutrition
      treatment for malnourished patients, optimization of growth and development,
      prevention of osteoporosis, first-line therapy for active disease, and
      maintenance of disease remission. In children and adolescents with CD,
      malnutrition is a common problem that adversely affects the prognosis. In at-risk
      adolescent CD patients, it is important to assess body composition, food intake, 
      energy expenditure, nutrient balance and serum levels of nutrients before
      planning interventions for this population. The aim of this study was to provide 
      a snapshot of the nutritional status of adolescents with CD in Brazil. METHODS:
      We prospectively selected 22 patients with mildly to moderately active CD, 29
      patients with inactive CD and 35 controls (first-degree relatives of and in the
      same age bracket as the CD patients). The age range of participants was between
      13.2 and 19.4 years old. We collected anthropometric data including weight,
      height, and body mass index (BMI), which were expressed as Z scores:
      weight-for-age, height-for-age and BMI-for-age, respectively, as well as using
      bioimpedance to determine body composition and assessing the Tanner stage. We
      also assessed macronutrients and micronutrients (serum levels and dietary intake 
      of both). We used the chi-square test to determine whether any of the studied
      variables were associated with inactive or active CD. The level of significance
      was set at 5 % (p < 0.05). We have written informed parental consent for
      participation for any minors and written informed consent for any participants
      that were adults. RESULTS: The mean values for lean body mass, Tanner stage,
      height-for-age Z score and BMI-for-age Z score were lower in the active CD group 
      than in the inactive CD and control groups (p < 0.05 for both). Compared with the
      controls, the CD patients showed significant differences in terms of the quality 
      of dietary intake (particularly in caloric intake, dietary protein intake,
      dietary fiber intake, and micronutrient intake), which were reflected in the
      serum levels of nutrients, mainly vitamins A and E (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS:
      Adolescents with CD (including those with mildly to moderately active or inactive
      disease) have a nutritional risk, which makes it important to conduct nutritional
      assessments in such patients.

AB  - Since the first publication on "regional ileitis", the relevance of this chronic 
      inflammatory disease condition termed finally as Crohn's disease is continuously 
      increasing. Although we are beginning to comprehend certain aspects of its
      pathogenesis, many facets remain unexplored. Host's gut microbiota is involved in
      a wide range of physiological and pathological processes including immune system 
      development, and pathogen regulation. Further, the microbiome is thought to play 
      a key role in Crohn's disease. The presence of Crohn's-associated variants of
      NOD2 and ATG16L genes appears to be associated not only with alterations of
      mucosal barrier functions, and bacterial killing, but the gut microbiota, as
      well, reflecting a potential relationship between the host's genotype and
      intestinal dysbiosis, involved in disease etiology. This review aims to
      characterize some exciting new aspect of Crohn's disease pathology, focusing
      mainly on the role of intestinal microbes, and their interplay with the immune
      system of the host.

PG  - 1-4
LID - 10.1586/17474124.2016.1120157 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin D, important for maintaining bone health in Crohn's disease (CD), may
      have potential as a treatment for the core inflammatory disease process. There is
      plausible evidence in favor of vitamin D as an anti-inflammatory from animal
      models, epidemiological and cross sectional studies of CD. Few clinical trials,
      however, have been published and therefore the translation of this promise into
      clinical benefit for people with CD remains unclear. The purpose of this piece is
      to consider the viability of vitamin D as a treatment for CD based on the current
      available evidence.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease
      are chronic relapsing and remitting chronic diseases for which there is no cure. 
      The treatment of IBD frequently requires immunosuppressive and biologic therapies
      which carry an increased risk of infections and possible malignancy. There is a
      continued search for safer and more natural therapies in the treatment of IBD.
      This review aims to summarize the most current literature on the use of dietary
      supplements for the treatment of IBD. Specifically, the efficacy and adverse
      effects of vitamin D, fish oil, probiotics, prebiotics, curcumin, Boswellia
      serrata, aloe vera and cannabis sativa are reviewed.

AB  - Paratuberculosis is an infectious disease which affects mainly domestic and wild 
      ruminants caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map). Map has
      been associated with human diseases like Crohn disease, type-1 diabetes,
      sarcoidosis, multiple sclerosis and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. The aim of this
      study was to determine the level of Map positivity of cheeses produced in Tuscany
      (Italy) as an indication of human exposure to the specific pathogen. Sampling was
      focused on artisanal cheeses produced without commercial starter culture from raw
      sheep or goat milk, on small-scale farms. Samples were tested by quantitative PCR
      (qPCR) and culture. Map DNA was detected in 4/7 (57.14%) goat, and in 14/25 (56%)
      sheep cheeses by qPCR, whereas cultivation produced a positive result in only one
      case. This corresponded to a goat cheese that had also reacted positively by qPCR
      and yielded a viable Type S (sheep) strain of Map. The Map load of the tested
      samples based on qPCR ranged from 6x10 to 1.8x10(4)Map cells/g of cheese. The
      results indicate on average 56.57% and 66.6% positivity of cheese samples and
      farms, respectively. Hence, the type of cheeses that were analyzed within the
      context of this study seem to constitute a considerable source of human exposure 
      to Map; although the question remains of whether the Map cells were present in a 
      viable form, since positive results were almost exclusively recorded by qPCR.

TI  - Zinc intake and risk of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis: a prospective
      cohort study.
PG  - 1995-2005
LID - 10.1093/ije/dyv301 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diet plays a role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) and
      ulcerative colitis (UC). Dietary zinc may influence risk of disease through
      effects on autophagy, innate and adaptive immune response and maintenance of the 
      intestinal barrier. METHODS: We analysed data from 170 776 women from the Nurses 
      Health Study I and Nurses Health Study II, who were followed for 26 years. Zinc
      intake was assessed using semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaires
      administered every 4 years. Incident CD and UC were ascertained by medical record
      review. Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for potential confounders
      determined the independent association between zinc intake and incident disease. 
      RESULTS: Over 3 317 550 person-years (p-y) of follow-up, we identified 269
      incident cases of CD and 338 incident cases of UC. Zinc intake ranged from 9
      mg/day in the lowest quintile to 27 mg/day in the highest quintile. Compared with
      women with the lowest quintile of intake, the multivariate hazard ratios (HR) for
      CD were 0.92 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.65 - 1.29) for women in the second 
      quintile of intake, 0.60 (95% CI, 0.40 - 0.89) for the third quintile, 0.57 (95% 
      CI, 0.38 - 0.86) for fourth quintile and 0.74 (95% CI, 0.50 - 1.10) for the
      highest quintile (Ptrend = 0.003). The association was stronger for dietary zinc 
      (HR 0.63, 95% CI, 0.43 - 0.93, comparing extreme quintiles) than for zinc intake 
      from supplements. Neither dietary nor supplemental zinc modified risk of UC.
      CONCLUSIONS: In two large prospective cohorts of women, intake of zinc was
      inversely associated with risk of CD but not UC.

AB  - Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease of unknown cause,
      affecting approximately 1.4 million North American people. Due to the
      similarities between Crohn's disease and Johne's disease, a chronic enteritis in 
      ruminant animals caused by Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis (MAP) infection, 
      MAP has long been considered to be a potential cause of Crohn's disease. MAP is
      an obligate intracellular pathogen that cannot replicate outside of animal hosts.
      MAP is widespread in dairy cattle and because of environmental contamination and 
      resistance to pasteurization and chlorination, humans are frequently exposed
      through contamination of food and water. MAP can be cultured from the peripheral 
      mononuclear cells from 50-100% of patients with Crohn's disease, and less
      frequently from healthy individuals. Association does not prove causation. We
      discuss the current data regarding MAP as a potential cause of Crohn's disease
      and outline what data will be required to firmly prove or disprove the
      hypothesis.

LID - 10.1097/MCG.0000000000000351 [doi]
AB  - The alterations in the gut microbiota observed in patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease and in particular in Crohn's disease and in ulcerative colitis
      patients with pouchitis, provide the rationale for administering probiotic agents
      in the medical treatment of those conditions. In the maintenance treatment of
      inactive Crohn's disease probiotics, when administered alone, were found
      ineffective in preventing clinical and/or endoscopic recurrence. By contrast, a
      combination of a probiotic agent (eg, Saccharomyces boulardii) with standard
      pharmacological therapy can promote clinical benefit. In patients with pouchitis,
      so far only the probiotic mixture VSL #3 proved to effectively prevent relapses
      after successful antibiotic treatment of active inflammation. Further controlled 
      studies, enrolling higher numbers of patients, are needed to better identify the 
      exact role of probiotics in this area.

AB  - Crohn's disease is due to the loss of immunological tolerance within the
      gastrointestinal tract to the antigenic array of Mycobacterium avium subspecies
      paratuberculosis (MAP) and closely related polymorphic variants. The loss of
      immune tolerance results in an effector cytokine responsive upon re-exposure to
      MAP. For immune tolerance to MAP to be induced, infection must occur when
      acquired immunity is markedly underdeveloped.

TI  - Micronutrient deficiencies in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 576-81
LID - 10.1097/MCO.0000000000000226 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Malnutrition, protein-energy, and micronutrient deficiencies
      are common among patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The deficiencies
      are a manifestation of the complicated disease and a cause of morbidity. The
      present review summarizes recent advances and evidence-based knowledge regarding 
      micronutrients in relation to patients with IBD. RECENT FINDINGS: Micronutrient
      deficiencies occur in more than half of patients with IBD. Most common are
      deficiencies of iron, B12, vitamin D, vitamin K, folic acid, selenium, zinc,
      vitamin B6, and vitamin B1. Deficiencies are more common in Crohn's disease than 
      in ulcerative colitis, and more in active disease than at times of remission.
      Micronutrient deficiency is associated with prolonged and complicated course of
      disease. Iron deficiency is the most common cause for anemia. Definite diagnosis 
      of B12 deficiency cannot be established by serum levels alone. Vitamin D and
      vitamin K deficiencies are thought to be associated with heightened inflammatory 
      state. The relationship of these deficiencies with bone disease is controversial.
      The present review focuses on the significance, epidemiology, treatment options, 
      and recommendations regarding micronutrient deficiencies in IBD. SUMMARY:
      Micronutrient deficiencies are common and have clinical significance. High
      suspicion for micronutrient deficiencies is advocated so that treatable causes of
      morbidity are treated appropriately and late and irreversible sequlae are
      prevented.

TI  - Psychological Factors in Irritable Pouch Syndrome and Other Pouch Disorders.
PG  - 2815-24
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000552 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is the 
      surgical treatment of choice for patients with medically refractory ulcerative
      colitis. Postsurgery, functional and inflammatory complications of the ileal
      pouch often occur. Our previous study demonstrated that irritable pouch syndrome 
      (IPS) is associated with the use of antidepressants or anxiolytics, suggesting an
      influence of psychological factors on patients' symptoms. The aim of this study
      was to identify the specific psychological factors and coping strategies in
      patients with functional (IPS) and inflammatory (pouchitis, cuffitis, Crohn's
      disease of the pouch) pouch disorders. METHODS: Consecutive patients with
      functional pouch disorders (IPS), inflammatory pouch conditions, and asymptomatic
      ileal pouch-anal anastomosis patients were surveyed using validated measures of
      quality of life (the Cleveland Global Quality of Life [CGQL] and Irritable Bowel 
      Syndrome-Quality of Life [IBS-QOL]), daily functional impairment (WSAS), coping
      mechanisms (brief COPE) and anxiety/depression (DASS-21). RESULTS: Of 243
      patients surveyed, 157 (64.6%) completed the surveys, of whom 137 (56.4%) met
      inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. Sixty-one percent of
      respondents had pouch inflammation (pouchitis, N = 35; cuffitis, N = 14; and
      Crohn's disease of the pouch, N = 35), 20% had IPS (N = 27) and 19% (N = 26) had 
      asymptomatic normal pouches. The age of participants ranged from 20 to 79 years
      with the mean ages of patients with normal pouches, IPS and inflammatory pouch
      conditions being 51.7 +/- 12.5, 47.1 +/- 15.0, 47.2 +/- 15.1 years, respectively.
      Patients with IPS were more likely to be taking antidepressants, anxiolytics, or 
      narcotics than the other groups (P < 0.04). Patients with IPS or inflammatory
      pouches had significantly poorer quality of life (CGQL, P < 0.001; IBS-QOL, P <
      0.003) than those with asymptomatic pouches, with differences particularly in the
      areas of food avoidance, activity interference, and sexual difficulties. Those
      with IPS (median = 11; interquartile range [IQR]: 3-19) or inflammatory pouch
      conditions (median = 7; IQR: 3-18) had a greater impairment in the domains of
      daily functioning related to the pouch condition than those with normal pouches
      (median = 1.5; IQR: 0-6; P = 0.003). The mean depression symptom scores were
      significantly higher in the IPS group than in the normal pouch group (11.7 +/-
      9.7 versus 4.4 +/- 6.2; P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: IPS patients were more likely to
      have depressive symptoms and had a greater amount of impairment in daily
      functioning related to their pouch condition. Additionally, patients with
      functional pouch disorders are more likely to be concurrently treated with
      antidepressants, anxiolytic or narcotic agents than those with inflammatory
      pouches or normal pouches.

AB  - Supplementation with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) may be
      beneficial for patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). In this study we 
      analyzed the pharmacokinetic profile of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), as the free 
      fatty acid (FFA), in an enteric-coated preparation, in 10 ulcerative colitis (UC)
      and 10 Crohn's disease (CD) patients and 15 healthy volunteers (HV). Subjects
      received 2 g daily of EPA-FFA for 8 weeks. Plasma phospholipid and red blood cell
      (RBC) membrane fatty acid content were measured by gas chromatography-mass
      spectrometry. There was a rapid incorporation of EPA into plasma phospholipids by
      2 weeks and a slower, but highly consistent, incorporation into RBC membranes (4%
      total fatty acid content; coefficient of variation 10-16%). There was a
      concomitant reduction in relative n-6 PUFA content. Elongation and desaturation
      of EPA into docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) via docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) were
      apparent and DHA content also increased in membranes. EPA-FFA is well tolerated
      and no difference in the pharmacokinetic profile of n-3 PUFA incorporation was
      detected between IBD patients and HV. Our data support the concept that EPA can
      be considered the "universal donor" with respect to key n-3 PUFAs and that this
      enteric-coated formulation allows long term treatment with a high level of
      compliance.

TI  - The gut microbiota and host health: a new clinical frontier.
PG  - 330-9
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2015-309990 [doi]
AB  - Over the last 10-15 years, our understanding of the composition and functions of 
      the human gut microbiota has increased exponentially. To a large extent, this has
      been due to new 'omic' technologies that have facilitated large-scale analysis of
      the genetic and metabolic profile of this microbial community, revealing it to be
      comparable in influence to a new organ in the body and offering the possibility
      of a new route for therapeutic intervention. Moreover, it might be more accurate 
      to think of it like an immune system: a collection of cells that work in unison
      with the host and that can promote health but sometimes initiate disease. This
      review gives an update on the current knowledge in the area of gut disorders, in 
      particular metabolic syndrome and obesity-related disease, liver disease, IBD and
      colorectal cancer. The potential of manipulating the gut microbiota in these
      disorders is assessed, with an examination of the latest and most relevant
      evidence relating to antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, polyphenols and faecal 
      microbiota transplantation.

AB  - Much has been written about the role of diet and risk for Crohn's disease (CD).
      However, the evidence is contradictory. Recent evidence has pointed to fiber
      playing an important role along with the possibility that dietary fat and
      overnutrition also have a role. Diet has a clearer place in disease modification,
      with some diets used in the treatment of CD. The lack of clarity stems from a
      poor understanding of the mechanisms underlying the relationship between diet and
      CD. Gut permeability is likely to play a key role in the risk for CD. Mechanisms 
      whereby diet can affect gut permeability, including the effects of the gut
      microbiota, are reviewed. Modification of disease behavior is likely to be
      influenced by additional mechanisms, including recognition of complex food
      antigens. As with many other chronic diseases, a surrogate marker of CD risk
      would greatly aid evaluation of the dietary factors involved. Formal measures of 
      gut permeability are too cumbersome for large-scale use, but fecal calprotectin
      may be a convenient measure of this. There are only preliminary data on the
      effect of diet and microbiota composition on fecal calprotectin and these require
      further investigation.

AB  - In this paper we discuss the evidence of vitamin K2 deficiency which is a factor 
      in several chronic diseases like diabetes, osteoporosis, cancer, inflammatory and
      cardiovascular diseases. This deficiency is very common in the mentioned diseases
      although it is rarely treated by clinicians. Randomized clinical trials have
      shown that patients with osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases and cancer can
      benefit from vitamin K2 supplement. Further studies are needed to ascertain the
      effect of vitamin K2 supplement in patients with diabetes and inflammatory bowel 
      diseases.

TI  - [Vitamin D deficiency and risk factors in children with Crohn's disease].
PG  - 516-21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the relationship between vitamin D status and seasons,
      disease activity, disease location, growth and steroid treatment in children with
      Crohn's disease (CD). To search for the risk factors of vitamin D deficiency in
      CD children. To discuss the role of vitamin D in the pathogenesis and treatments 
      of CD. METHOD: Sixty CD children (63.3% male) and 121 sex- and age-matched
      healthy subjects were enrolled. Data including growth, clinical characteristics, 
      time for vitamin D blood test, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C reactive
      protein, serum 25(OH)D concentration and steroid treatments were collected. The
      relationship between vitamin D status and disease activity, disease location,
      growth and steroid treatments in children with CD were analized. RESULT: The
      serum concentration of 25(OH)D was 57.2(22.3-246.0) nmol/L, which was
      significantly lower than that of controls (67.3 (57.3-78.4) nmol/L) (Z=-5.009,
      P=0.000). Hypovitaminosis D was most prevalent during the winter and spring
      (November to April, 46.8(31.8-83.4) nmol/L) rather than summer and autumn (May to
      October, 63.3(22.3-246.0) nmol/L, Z=-1.994, P=0.046). Univariate logistic
      regression demonstrated that factors increasing the risk of vitamin D deficiency 
      in Crohn's disease were: age over 10 years (OR=4.571, 95% CI: 1.452-14.389),
      small intestine involved diseases (OR=5.211, 95% CI: 1.278-21.237), high C
      reactive protein levels (>/=8 mg/L) (OR=4.500, 95% CI: 1.094-18.503) and steroid 
      therapy (OR=4.297, 95% CI: 1.413-13.068). Among those risk factors, all but age
      were determined to be risks of vitamin D deficiency by further multivariate
      logistic regression. There was no significant correlation between vitamin D
      deficiency and gender, disease duration, stricture, penetration, perianal disease
      (fistula, ulcer or abscess), white blood cell counts, hemoglobin, platelet
      counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum albumin levels, pediatric Crohn's
      disease activity index and nutrition therapy (P>0.05). CONCLUSION:
      Hypovitaminosis D was prevalent in children with CD. Serum concentration of
      vitamin D was associated with season. Steroid treatment, small intestine involved
      disease and high C reactive protein (more than 8 mg/L) are risk factors of
      vitamin D deficiency in CD children.

TI  - The potential Public Health Impact of Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis: 
      Global Opinion Survey of Topic Specialists.
PG  - 212-22
LID - 10.1111/zph.12221 [doi]
AB  - Global research knowledge has accumulated over the past few decades, and there is
      reasonable evidence for a positive association between Mycobacterium avium spp.
      paratuberculosis and Crohn's disease in humans, although its role as a human
      pathogen has not been entirely accepted. For this reason, management of public
      health risk due to M. paratuberculosis remains an important policy issue in
      agri-food public health arenas in many countries. Responsible authorities must
      decide whether existing mitigation strategies are sufficient to prevent or reduce
      human exposure to M. paratuberculosis. A Web-based questionnaire was administered
      to topic specialists to elicit empirical knowledge and opinion on the overall
      public health impact of M. paratuberculosis, the importance of various routes of 
      human exposure to the pathogen, existing mitigation strategies and the need for
      future strategies. The questionnaire had four sections and consisted of 20 closed
      and five open questions. Topic specialists believed that M. paratuberculosis is
      likely a risk to human health (44.8%) and, given the paucity of available
      evidence, most frequently ranked it as a moderate public health issue (40.1%). A 
      significant correlation was detected between topic specialists' commitment to M. 
      paratuberculosis in terms of the number of years or proportion of work dedicated 
      to this topic, and the likelihood of an extreme answer (high or low) to the above
      questions. Topic specialists identified contact with ruminants and dairy products
      as the most likely routes of exposure for humans. There was consensus on exposure
      routes for ruminants and what commodities to target in mitigation efforts.
      Described mandatory programmes mainly focused on culling diseased animals and
      voluntary on-farm prevention programmes. Despite ongoing difficulties in the
      identification of subclinical infections in animals, the topic specialists
      largely agreed that further enhancement of on-farm programmes in affected
      commodities by the agri-food industry (68.4%) and allocation of resources by
      governments to monitor the issue (92%) are most appropriate given the current
      state of evidence.

TI  - Enteral nutrition for maintaining remission in patients with quiescent Crohn's
      disease: current status and future perspectives.
PG  - 1-7
LID - 10.1007/s00384-015-2348-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The value of enteral nutrition (EN) as maintenance therapy in patients
      with quiescent Crohn's disease (CD) has not been fully evaluated. The purpose of 
      this study was to review the efficacy of EN for the maintenance of remission in
      patients with quiescent CD. METHODS: Seven prospective cohort studies evaluating 
      the efficacy of EN for the maintenance of remission in quiescent CD were
      included. Three of the seven studies were randomized-controlled trials (RCTs). In
      all studies, patients used EN as a supplement or as a nocturnal tube feeding in
      addition to their normal food. RESULTS: One study compared the efficacy of
      elemental diet and polymeric diet. Elemental and polymeric diets were equally
      effective for the maintenance of clinical remission and for allowing tapering and
      cessation of steroid therapy. The other six studies compared the outcomes between
      patients treated with and without EN. The maintained clinical remission rate at 1
      year was significantly higher in patients treated with EN in four of the six
      studies. Quantitative pooling of the studies was not feasible due to a small
      number of RCTs and a narrative account of the study characteristics. CONCLUSIONS:
      Our review suggests that EN is useful for the maintenance of remission in
      patients with quiescent CD. However, there are several limitations in the
      reviewed studies. There are few RCTs. Further, the sample size is small, and the 
      duration of intervention and follow-up is short. Large and well-designed RCTs
      should be conducted to rigorously evaluate the efficacy of EN for maintaining
      remission.

PG  - 2311-9
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000501 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diet may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's
      disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC); yet, there are few prospective studies 
      of dietary factors. None have examined the association between adolescent diet
      and risk of inflammatory bowel diseases (CD and UC). METHODS: This study included
      women enrolled in Nurses' Health Study II who completed a validated high school
      dietary questionnaire in 1998. We examined the effect of dietary patterns
      (prudent or Western diet) and individual components of each patterns. We
      documented incident cases of CD and UC through 2011 based on physician review of 
      medical records and used Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for
      confounders to estimate hazard ratios and confidence intervals for CD and UC.
      RESULTS: Over 763,229 person-years of follow-up, we identified 70 incident cases 
      of CD and 103 cases of UC. Compared with women in the lowest quartile of a
      prudent diet score (characterized by greater intake of fruits, vegetables, and
      fish), women in the highest quartile had a 53% lower risk of CD (hazard ratio,
      0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.23-0.98; P trend = 0.04). Specifically, greater 
      intake of fish (P trend = 0.01) and fiber (P trend = 0.06) were associated with
      lower risk of CD. In contrast, Western diet score was not associated with risk of
      CD. Neither dietary patterns nor individual food or nutrient groups was
      associated with UC. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent diet is associated with risk of CD,
      but not UC, offering insights into disease pathogenesis.

      Crohn's Disease Patients in New Zealand.
PG  - 70-80
LID - 10.1159/000435783 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diet is known to play a major role in Crohn's disease (CD). It has
      also been reported that the minor G allele from the rs12212067 polymorphism (T>G)
      in FOXO3 is associated with milder CD. The aim of this study was to investigate
      the association between the rs12212067 polymorphism and food intolerances for a
      total of 253 foods. METHODS: Tolerances and intolerances were recorded on a
      self-reported dietary questionnaire. Each food was scored on a 5-point ordinal
      scale: beneficial effects as '+ +' or '+', adverse effects as '- -' or '-', and
      'makes no difference' as '='. Dietary and genotype data were available for a
      total of 283 CD patients. RESULTS: We identified 17 foods with beneficial effects
      in our study which were significantly associated with the G allele of the FOXO3
      rs12212067 polymorphism. Of these, sweet potatoes had the highest reported
      frequency of beneficial responses. We also identified 4 foods with detrimental
      effects in more than 25% of our study population. These were mustard, wasabi, and
      raw and cooked tomatoes, which again were significantly associated with the G
      allele in FOXO3. CONCLUSIONS: There was strong evidence that adverse effects of
      mustard, wasabi, and raw and cooked tomatoes were significantly associated with
      the G allele of FOXO3 and that these foods should be avoided by people carrying
      this allele.

TI  - Dietary intake of inulin-type fructans in active and inactive Crohn's disease and
      healthy controls: a case-control study.
PG  - 1024-31
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv136 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Prebiotic inulin-type fructans are widely consumed in the
      diet and may have contrasting effects in Crohn's disease by stimulating gut
      microbiota and/or by generating functional gastrointestinal symptoms. The aim of 
      this study was to measure fructan and oligofructose intakes in patients with
      active and inactive Crohn's disease compared with healthy controls. METHODS:
      Patients with active Crohn's disease (n = 98), inactive Crohn's (n = 99) and
      healthy controls (n = 106) were recruited to a case-control study. Dietary intake
      of inulin-type fructans was measured using a specific food frequency
      questionnaire and was compared between the three groups and between patients with
      different disease phenotypes (Montreal classification). Associations between
      intakes and disease activity (Harvey-Bradshaw Index, HBI) were also undertaken.
      RESULTS: Patients with active Crohn's disease had lower fructan intakes (median
      2.9 g/d, interquartile range [IQR] 1.8) than those with inactive Crohn's (3.6
      g/d, 2.1, p = 0.036) or controls (3.9 g/d, 2.1, p = 0.003) and lower
      oligofructose intakes (2.8 g/d, 1.8) than those with inactive Crohn's (3.5 g/d,
      2.2, p = 0.048) or controls (3.8 g/d, 2.1, p = 0.003). There were no differences 
      in intakes related to disease site or behaviour. There were negative correlations
      between HBI well-being score and fructan intake (rho = -0.154, p = 0.03) and
      oligofructose intake (rho = -0.156, p = 0.028) and for the HBI abdominal pain
      score and fructan (rho = -0.164, p = 0.021) and oligofructose intake (rho =
      -0.157, p = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with active Crohn's disease consume
      lower quantities of fructans and oligofructose than their inactive counterparts
      and healthy controls. The impact of lower intakes of prebiotic fructans on gut
      microbiota is unknown and warrants further research.

TI  - Volatile Organic Compounds in Exhaled Air as Novel Marker for Disease Activity in
      Crohn's Disease: A Metabolomic Approach.
PG  - 1776-85
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000436 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Disappearance of macroscopic mucosal inflammation predicts long-term 
      outcome in Crohn's disease (CD). It can be assessed by ileocolonoscopy, which is,
      however, an invasive and expensive procedure. Disease activity indices do not
      correlate well with endoscopic activity and noninvasive markers have a low
      sensitivity in subgroups of patients. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in breath
      are of increasing interest as noninvasive markers. The aim of this study was to
      investigate whether VOCs can accurately differentiate between active CD and
      remission. METHODS: Patients participated in a 1-year follow-up study and
      Harvey-Bradshaw index, blood, fecal, and breath samples were collected at regular
      intervals. Patients were stratified into 2 groups: active (fecal calprotectin
      >250 microg/g) or inactive (Harvey-Bradshaw index <4, C-reactive protein <5 mg/L,
      and fecal calprotectin <100 microg/g) disease. Breath samples were analyzed by
      gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Random forest analyses were 
      used to find the most discriminatory VOCs. RESULTS: Eight hundred thirty-five
      breath-o-grams were measured, 140 samples were assigned as active, 135 as
      inactive disease, and 110 samples of healthy controls. A set of 10 discriminatory
      VOCs correctly predicted active CD in 81.5% and remission in 86.4% (sensitivity
      0.81, specificity 0.80, AUC 0.80). These VOCs were combined into a single disease
      activity score that classified disease activity in more than 60% of the
      previously undetermined individuals. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that VOCs can
      separate healthy controls and patients with active CD and CD in remission in a
      real-life cohort. Analysis of exhaled air is an interesting new noninvasive
      application for monitoring mucosal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Fragments of Citrullinated and MMP-degraded Vimentin and MMP-degraded Type III
      Collagen Are Novel Serological Biomarkers to Differentiate Crohn's Disease from
      Ulcerative Colitis.
PG  - 863-72
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv123 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A hallmark of inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] is chronic
      inflammation, which leads to excessive extracellular matrix [ECM] remodelling and
      release of specific protein fragments, called neoepitopes. We speculated that the
      biomarker profile panel for ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn's disease [CD]
      represent a heterogeneous expression pattern, and may be applied as a tool to aid
      in the differentiation between UC and CD. METHODS: Serum biomarkers of degraded
      collagens I, III-IV [C1M, C3M, and C4M], collagen type 1 and IV formation [P1NP, 
      P4NP], and citrullinated and MMP-degraded vimentin [VICM] were studied with a
      competitive ELISA assay system in a cohort including 164 subjects [CD n = 72, UC 
      n = 60, and non-IBD controls n = 32] and a validation cohort of 61 subjects [CD n
      = 46, and UC n = 15]. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and
      logistic regression modelling were carried out to evaluate the discriminative
      power of the biomarkers. RESULTS: All biomarkers were corrected for confounding
      factors. VICM and C3M demonstrated the highest diagnostic power, alone, to
      differentiate CD from UC with an area under the curve [AUC] of 0.77 and 0.69,
      respectively. Furthermore, the biomarkers C1M [AUC = 0.81], C3M [AUC = 0.83],
      VICM [AUC = 0.83], and P1NP [AUC = 0.77] were best to differentiate UC from
      non-IBD. The best combinations of biomarkers to differentiate CD from UC and UC
      from non-IBD were VICM, C3M, C4M [AUC = 0.90] and VICM, C3M [AUC = 0.98]
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Specific extracellular matrix degradation markers are 
      elevated in IBD and can discriminate CD from UC and UC from non-IBD controls with
      a high diagnostic accuracy.

TI  - Dietary Fiber Intake is Associated with Increased Colonic Mucosal GPR43+
      Polymorphonuclear Infiltration in Active Crohn's Disease.
PG  - 5327-46
LID - 10.3390/nu7075223 [doi]
AB  - G protein-coupled receptor 43/free fatty acid receptor 2 (GPR43/FFAR2) is
      essential for polymorphonuclear (PMN) recruitment. We investigated the expression
      of GPR43/FFAR2 in the colon from Crohn's disease patients and whether dietary
      fiber in enteral nutrition increases GPR43+ polymorphonuclear infiltration in
      mucosa. Segments of ascending colon and white blood cells from peripheral blood
      were obtained from 46 Crohn's disease patients and 10 colon cancer patients. The 
      Crohn's disease patients were grouped by the activity of disease (active or
      remission) and enteral nutrition with or without dietary fiber. Histological
      feature, expression and location of GPR43/FFAR2 and level of tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukine-6 (IL-6) and myeloperoxidase were
      assessed. The results of hematoxylin-eosin and immunohistochemistry staining
      revealed that the infiltration of immune cells, including GPR43+ PMN, was more
      severe in active Crohn's disease patients who consumed normal food or enteral
      nutrition with dietary fiber than in remission patients and colon cancer
      patients. This finding was supported by the results of GPR43 and myeloperoxidase 
      expression. Active Crohn's disease (CD) patients who consumed enteral nutrition
      without dietary fiber exhibited severe immune cell infiltration similar to the
      other active CD patients, but GPR43+ PMNs were rarely observed. The level of
      TNF-alpha mRNA in active Crohn's disease patients was higher than those of the
      other patients. In conclusion, the use of dietary fiber in enteral nutrition by
      active Crohn's disease patients might increase GPR43+ PMNs infiltration in colon 
      mucosa. This effect was not observed in Crohn's disease patients in remission.

AB  - Several epidemiological investigations have been conducted to evaluate the
      relationship between dietary fiber intake and inflammatory bowel diseases, but
      the results are inconsistent. This meta-analysis was performed to quantitatively 
      summarize the evidence from observational studies. PubMed, Embase, and Web of
      Knowledge were searched for relevant articles published up to November 2014. The 
      combined relative risks were calculated with the fixed- or random-effects model. 
      Dose-response relationship was assessed using restricted cubic spline model. We
      hypothesized that the meta-analysis could yield a summary effect, which would
      indicate that dietary fiber intake could decrease the risk of ulcerative colitis 
      and Crohn disease (CD). Overall, 8 articles involving 2 cohort studies, 1 nested 
      case-control study, and 5 case-control studies were finally included in this
      study. The pooled relative risks with 95% confidence intervals of ulcerative
      colitis and CD for the highest vs lowest categories of dietary fiber intake were 
      0.80 (0.64-1.00) and 0.44 (0.29-0.69), respectively. A linear dose-response
      relationship was found between dietary fiber and CD risk, and the risk of CD
      decreased by 13% (P < .05) for every 10 g/d increment in fiber intake. The
      results from this meta-analysis indicated that the intake of dietary fiber was
      significantly associated with a decreased risk of inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of certolizumab pegol for Crohn's disease in clinical
      practice.
PG  - 428-40
LID - 10.1111/apt.13288 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Certolizumab pegol (CZP) is Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA)-approved to treat Crohn's disease (CD). However, the efficacy and safety of
      CZP outside clinical trials are not well established. AIM: To report the
      efficacy, safety and predictors of response to CZP in CD patients treated during 
      a 6-year period since FDA-approval at a tertiary care centre. METHODS: All CD
      patients who received CZP at our institution between 2008 and 2013 were evaluated
      through retrospective medical record-based review of steroid-free complete
      response (SCR), loss of response and safety. RESULTS: A total of 358 patients
      were included. One hundred twelve patients (31.3%) and 189 (52.8%) received CZP
      as their second and third biological agent, respectively. The probability of SCR 
      at 26 week was 19.9% (95% CI, 15.9-24.5). The probability of survival free of
      loss of response at 2 year was 45.7% (95% CI, 32.5-59.5). A predictor of SCR was 
      age at CD diagnosis of >40 years old (hazard ratio, HR relative to those <17,
      4.69; 95% CI, 1.75-12.61). Negative predictors included present perianal fistula 
      (HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.16-0.98) and prior primary nonresponse to adalimumab (ADA;
      HR relative to secondary loss of response, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.04-0.76). Twenty-three
      patients (6.4%) experienced serious adverse events and 19 patients (5.3%)
      discontinued CZP due to adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Certolizumab pegol was both 
      effective and well tolerated for the treatment of Crohn's disease in this large
      tertiary care centre enriched with biologics-exposed patients. It may be more
      effective in patients without early-aged Crohn's disease diagnosis, prior primary
      nonresponse to adalimumab and present perianal fistula.

TI  - Severe scurvy: an underestimated disease.
PG  - 1076-7
LID - 10.1038/ejcn.2015.99 [doi]
AB  - Scurvy is one of the oldest diseases in human history. Nowadays, although scurvy 
      tends to become a forgotten disease in developed country, rare cases still occur,
      especially in people undergoing extreme diet, old people or children with poor
      diet and patients with malabsorption. We describe three cases of scurvy. The
      first case is a patient diagnosed with Crohn's disease, the second one is in a
      context of anorexia nervosa and drug addiction, and the third case is in a
      context of social isolation. Early recognition of scurvy can be difficult because
      symptoms may appear nonspecific and can mimic more common conditions. In any
      patient with spontaneous hematoma and purpura, in the context of nutritional
      disorder, scurvy should be systematically considered. As this disease can lead to
      severe complications, such as bone pain, heart failure or gastrointestinal
      symptoms, nothing should delay vitamin C supplementation, which is a simple and
      rapidly effective treatment.

TI  - Phenome-driven disease genetics prediction toward drug discovery.
PG  - i276-83
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btv245 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Discerning genetic contributions to diseases not only enhances our
      understanding of disease mechanisms, but also leads to translational
      opportunities for drug discovery. Recent computational approaches incorporate
      disease phenotypic similarities to improve the prediction power of disease gene
      discovery. However, most current studies used only one data source of human
      disease phenotype. We present an innovative and generic strategy for combining
      multiple different data sources of human disease phenotype and predicting
      disease-associated genes from integrated phenotypic and genomic data. RESULTS: To
      demonstrate our approach, we explored a new phenotype database from biomedical
      ontologies and constructed Disease Manifestation Network (DMN). We combined DMN
      with mimMiner, which was a widely used phenotype database in disease gene
      prediction studies. Our approach achieved significantly improved performance over
      a baseline method, which used only one phenotype data source. In the
      leave-one-out cross-validation and de novo gene prediction analysis, our approach
      achieved the area under the curves of 90.7% and 90.3%, which are significantly
      higher than 84.2% (P < e(-4)) and 81.3% (P < e(-12)) for the baseline approach.
      We further demonstrated that our predicted genes have the translational potential
      in drug discovery. We used Crohn's disease as an example and ranked the candidate
      drugs based on the rank of drug targets. Our gene prediction approach prioritized
      druggable genes that are likely to be associated with Crohn's disease
      pathogenesis, and our rank of candidate drugs successfully prioritized the Food
      and Drug Administration-approved drugs for Crohn's disease. We also found
      literature evidence to support a number of drugs among the top 200 candidates. In
      summary, we demonstrated that a novel strategy combining unique disease phenotype
      data with system approaches can lead to rapid drug discovery. AVAILABILITY AND

LID - S2210-7401(15)00085-6 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Association of Signal transducers and activators of transcription-4
      (STAT4) gene polymorphism with susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease have 
      been investigated in a number of epidemiological studies, but the results are
      inclusive. The aim of this meta-analysis was to more precisely estimate the
      relationship. METHODS: The databases of Pubmed and CBM updated to October, 2014
      were retrieved. Random- or fixed-effect model was used to estimate odd radio (OR)
      and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95%CI) on the basis of heterogeneity. 
      RESULTS: Seven articles containing 2196 Crohn's disease (CD) cases, 1588
      ulcerative colitis (UC) cases and 4126 controls were identified. We detected a
      significant association between STAT4 rs7574865 polymorphism and IBD
      susceptibility in overall population (GG vs. GT+TT, OR=0.855, 95% CI=0.760-0.962,
      P=0.009), but not in Caucasian and Asian population, respectively. No association
      was detected between rs7574865 polymorphism and CD susceptibility in overall,
      Asian and Caucasian population, respectively. Interestingly, a significant
      association was detected between rs7574865 with UC susceptibility in overall
      population (G vs. T, OR=0.881, 95% CI=0.798-0.972, P=0.012; GG vs. GT+TT,
      OR=0.788, 95% CI=0.679-0.914, P=0.002; GG vs. TT, OR=0.683, 95% CI=0.498-0.937,
      P=0.018) and Caucasians (GG vs. GT+TT, OR=0.833, 95% CI=0.701-0.990, P=0.038;
      GG+GT vs. TT, OR=0.667, 95% CI=0.456-0.975, P=0.037; GG vs. TT, OR=0.636, 95%
      CI=0.433-0.934, P=0.021), respectively, and a possible association was found in
      Asian population (GG vs. GT+TT, OR=0.709, 95% CI=0.503-0.998, P=0.049).
      CONCLUSIONS: STAT4 rs7574865 gene is IBD risk factor, and this gene polymorphism 
      is associated with UC susceptibility, especially in Caucasians. To confirm these 
      findings, further studies with more sample size are required for a definitive
      conclusion.

TI  - Identification of an anti-inflammatory protein from Faecalibacterium prausnitzii,
      a commensal bacterium deficient in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 415-425
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2014-307649 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD)-associated dysbiosis is characterised by a loss 
      of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, whose culture supernatant exerts an
      anti-inflammatory effect both in vitro and in vivo. However, the chemical nature 
      of the anti-inflammatory compounds has not yet been determined. METHODS:
      Peptidomic analysis using mass spectrometry was applied to F. prausnitzii
      supernatant. Anti-inflammatory effects of identified peptides were tested in
      vitro directly on intestinal epithelial cell lines and on cell lines transfected 
      with a plasmid construction coding for the candidate protein encompassing these
      peptides. In vivo, the cDNA of the candidate protein was delivered to the gut by 
      recombinant lactic acid bacteria to prevent dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid
      (DNBS)-colitis in mice. RESULTS: The seven peptides, identified in the F.
      prausnitzii culture supernatants, derived from a single microbial
      anti-inflammatory molecule (MAM), a protein of 15 kDa, and comprising 53% of
      non-polar residues. This last feature prevented the direct characterisation of
      the putative anti-inflammatory activity of MAM-derived peptides. Transfection of 
      MAM cDNA in epithelial cells led to a significant decrease in the activation of
      the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB pathway with a dose-dependent effect. Finally, the
      use of a food-grade bacterium, Lactococcus lactis, delivering a plasmid encoding 
      MAM was able to alleviate DNBS-induced colitis in mice. CONCLUSIONS: A 15 kDa
      protein with anti-inflammatory properties is produced by F. prausnitzii, a
      commensal bacterium involved in CD pathogenesis. This protein is able to inhibit 
      the NF-kappaB pathway in intestinal epithelial cells and to prevent colitis in an
      animal model.

TI  - Clinical applications of bioactive milk components.
PG  - 463-76
AB  - Milk represents a unique resource for translational medicine: It contains a rich 
      pool of biologically active molecules with demonstrated clinical benefits. The
      ongoing characterization of the mechanistic process through which milk components
      promote development and immunity has revealed numerous milk-derived compounds
      with potential applications as clinical therapies in infectious and inflammatory 
      disease, cancer, and other conditions. Lactoferrin is an effective antimicrobial 
      and antiviral agent in high-risk patient populations and a potentially potent
      adjuvant to chemotherapy in lung cancer. Enteric nutrition formulas supplemented 
      with transforming growth factor beta, a milk cytokine, have been shown to promote
      remission in pediatric Crohn's disease. A number of milk glycans, including human
      milk oligosaccharides, show promise in preclinical studies as antimicrobial and
      anti-inflammatory agents. While active preclinical investigations of human milk
      may soon result in large-scale production of human milk molecules, bovine milk
      components in many instances represent a practical source of bioactive milk
      compounds for use in clinical trials. This review summarizes current efforts to
      translate the compounds derived from human and bovine milk into effective
      clinical therapies. These efforts suggest a common pathway for the translation of
      milk-derived compounds into clinical applications.

TI  - Organic cation transporter Octn1-mediated uptake of food-derived antioxidant
      ergothioneine into infiltrating macrophages during intestinal inflammation in
      mice.

AB  - OCTN1/SLC22A4 is expressed on apical membranes of small intestine, and is
      involved in gastrointestinal absorption of its substrates, including the
      food-derived antioxidant ergothioneine (ERGO). ERGO concentration in circulating 
      blood of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease) is lower than
      that in healthy volunteers; thus, circulating ERGO is a potential diagnostic
      marker, although the mechanisms underlying low ERGO concentration in patients are
      unknown. Here, we focused on intestinal macrophages, which infiltrate sites of
      inflammation, and examined possible first-pass uptake of ERGO by macrophages.
      ERGO concentration in blood was lower in mice with dextran sodium sulfate
      (DSS)-induced colitis than in controls. On the other hand, expression of octn1
      gene product and ERGO concentration in intestinal tissues of DSS-treated mice
      were higher than in controls. Interestingly, lamina propria mononuclear cells
      (LPMCs) isolated from DSS-treated mice contained ERGO and showed [(3)H]ERGO
      uptake and Octn1 expression, whereas ERGO was undetectable in LPMCs of control
      mice. Functional expression of OCTN1 was also confirmed in LPS-stimulated human
      macrophage-like cell line, THP-1. In conclusion, OCTN1 is functionally expressed 
      on activated intestinal macrophages, and ERGO uptake into these immune cells
      could contribute at least in part to the altered disposition of ERGO in
      intestinal inflammation.

TI  - Anti-inflammatory Effects of Ganoderma lucidum Triterpenoid in Human Crohn's
      Disease Associated with Downregulation of NF-kappaB Signaling.
PG  - 1918-25
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000439 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the
      gastrointestinal tract. Current medications have potentially serious side
      effects. Hence, there is increasing interest in alternative therapies. We
      previously demonstrated the anti-inflammatory effects of Food Allergy Herbal
      Formula-2 in vitro on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and mucosa from 
      CD subjects. Here, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of a bioactive
      compound isolated from Ganoderma lucidum (G. lucidum), a key herbal constituent
      of Food Allergy Herbal Formula-2, in CD in vitro. METHODS: Triterpene ganoderic
      acid C1 (GAC1) was isolated from G. lucidum. Stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages
      were treated with GAC1. Human PBMCs and colonic biopsies were obtained from
      children with CD and cultured with or without GAC1. TNF-alpha and other
      proinflammatory cytokine levels were measured in the culture supernatant.
      NF-kappaB signaling was investigated in PBMCs and colonic mucosa treated with
      GAC1 by In-Cell Western and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: GAC1 decreased
      TNF-alpha production by macrophages and PBMCs from CD subjects. GAC1
      significantly decreased TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and IL-17A production by inflamed
      colonic biopsies from CD subjects. These effects were due to downregulation of
      the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: GAC1 inhibited production of
      TNF-alpha and other proinflammatory cytokines by PBMCs and inflamed CD colonic
      mucosa due to blockage of NF-kappaB activation. GAC1 is a key beneficial
      constituent in G. lucidum and the Food Allergy Herbal Formula-2 in suppressing
      the inflammatory cytokines found in CD and warrants clinical investigation for
      the treatment of CD.

TI  - Glucose breath test and Crohn's disease: Diagnosis of small intestinal bacterial 
      overgrowth and evaluation of therapeutic response.
PG  - 1376-81

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is characterized by an
      abnormal proliferation of bacterial species in the small bowel. It has been shown
      that patients with Crohn's disease (CD) have a higher risk of SIBO development.
      The aim of the present study was to investigate SIBO prevalence in CD patients,
      possible clinical predictors of SIBO development and response to antibiotic
      therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty-eight patients (42 male, 26 female; mean age
      49.3 +/- 12.8 years) with CD reporting abdominal complaints were prospectively
      evaluated for SIBO with H2/CH4 glucose breath test (GBT). RESULTS: Of the 68
      patients enrolled, 18 (26.5%) tested positive for SIBO. Patients with SIBO
      exhibited increased stool frequency and significant reduction of stool solidity
      (p = 0.014), were older than patients tested negative to GBT (54.3 +/- 13.0 years
      vs. 47.5 +/- 12.3 years, p = 0.049), reported a longer history of CD (21.2 +/-
      10.3 years vs. 15.7 +/- 10.2 years, p = 0.031) and showed a significant higher
      frequency of prior surgery (p = 0.001), revealing an association of number of
      surgical procedures (OR = 2.8315, 95% CI = 1.1525-6.9569, p = 0.023) with SIBO.
      Breath test normalization occurred in 13/15 patients evaluated after antibiotic
      and probiotic therapy. Although vitamin B12 levels were lower in patients with
      SIBO (p = 0.045) and a significant improvement was found after treatment (p =
      0.011), this could be due to the heterogeneity, regarding vitamin B12 treatment, 
      in our cohort. CONCLUSION: SIBO is a frequent but underestimated condition in CD,
      which often mimics acute flare, effectively identified with GBT and could be
      treated with a combined antibiotic and probiotic therapy.

TI  - The zoonotic potential of Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis: a systematic
      review and meta-analyses of the evidence.
PG  - 3135-57
LID - 10.1017/S095026881500076X [doi]
AB  - This systematic review-meta-analysis appraises and summarizes all the available
      research (128 papers) on the zoonotic potential of Mycobacterium avium ssp.
      paratuberculosis. The latter has been debated for a century due to pathogenic and
      clinical similarities between Johne's disease in ruminants and Crohn's disease
      (108 studies) in humans and recently for involvement in other human diseases;
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (2), sarcoidosis (3), diabetes
      mellitus type 1 (T1DM) (7) and type 2 (3), multiple sclerosis (5) and Hashimoto's
      thyroiditis (2). Meta-analytical results indicated a significant positive
      association, consistently across different laboratory methods for Crohn's disease
      [odds ratio (OR) range 4.26-8.44], T1DM (OR range 2.91-9.95) and multiple
      sclerosis (OR range 6.5-7.99). The latter two and the thyroiditis hypothesis
      require further investigation to confirm the association. Meta-regression of
      Crohn's disease studies using DNA detection methods indicated that choice of
      primers and sampling frame (e.g. general population vs. hospital-based sample)
      explained a significant proportion of heterogeneity. Other epidemiological
      studies demonstrated a lack of association between high-risk occupations and
      development of Crohn's disease. Due to knowledge gaps in understanding the role
      of M. paratuberculosis in the development or progression of human disease, the
      evidence at present is not strong enough to inform the potential public health
      impact of M. paratuberculosis exposure.

TI  - The Value of Vedolizumab as Rescue Therapy in Moderate-Severe Crohn's Disease
      Patients with Adalimumab Non-response in the USA.
PG  - 669-75
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv090 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In May 2014, vedolizumab was approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration for the treatment of moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease. In
      clinical practice it is typically used in patients who are primary or secondary
      non-responders to adalimumab [Humira]. We aim to estimate the incremental
      benefits and costs of using vedolizumab as rescue therapy for adalimumab
      non-responders. METHODS: A Markov model was used to simulate the clinical course 
      of Crohn's disease in a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 patients over a 12-month
      period. The treatment strategies evaluated were adalimumab only [with and without
      dose intensification] and adalimumab and vedolizumab [with and without adalimumab
      dose intensification]. The base case strategy was adalimumab only with 25% of
      non-responders undergoing dose intensification. Our primary outcomes were changes
      in costs and quality of life measures over the analytical horizon. RESULTS: In a 
      1-year period, initiating vedolizumab as rescue therapy in adalimumab
      non-responders reduces the average total cost per patient by 10%, and increases
      the average amount of time spent in remission or mild disease by up to 2 months. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Treating on-label adalimumab non-responders with vedolizumab can, in
      the short term, significantly improves the quality of life of Crohn's disease
      patients that do not respond to adalimumab.

TI  - Products for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease: a patent review (2013 -
      2014).
PG  - 629-42
LID - 10.1517/13543776.2015.1041921 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consists of Crohn's disease,
      ulcerative colitis and an unspecific IBD. The unclear etiology of IBD is a
      limiting factor that complicates the development of new pharmacological
      treatments and explains the high frequency of refractory patients to current
      drugs, including both conventional and biological therapies. In view of this,
      recent progress on the development of novel patented products to treat IBD was
      reviewed. AREAS COVERED: Evaluation of the patent literature during the period
      2013 - 2014 focused on chemical compounds, functional foods and biological
      therapy useful for the treatment of IBD. EXPERT OPINION: Majority of the patents 
      are not conclusive because they were based on data from unspecific methods not
      related to intestinal inflammation and, when related to IBD models, few
      biochemical and molecular evaluations that could be corroborating their use in
      human IBD were presented. On the other hand, methods and strategies using new
      formulations of conventional drugs, guanylyl cyclase C peptide agonists,
      compounds that influence anti-adhesion molecules, mAbs anti-type I interferons
      and anti-integrin, oligonucleotide antisense Smad7, growth factor neuregulin 4
      and functional foods, particularly fermented wheat germ with Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae, are promising products for use in the very near future.

TI  - Single High-Dose Oral Vitamin D3 Therapy (Stoss): A Solution to Vitamin D
      Deficiency in Children With Inflammatory Bowel Disease?
PG  - 411-4
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000823 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Vitamin D deficiency is common in children with inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). The aim of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of 
      stoss therapy on vitamin D levels during a period of 6 months in children with
      IBD and vitamin D deficiency (<50 nmol/L). METHODS: A retrospective chart review 
      was undertaken, focusing upon children managed in the IBD clinic at Sydney
      Children's Hospital between 2006 and 2010. Those with a 25-hydroxyvitamin D
      (25-OHD) level <50 nmol/L and those who received stoss therapy were included in
      this study. RESULTS: A total of 76 children received stoss therapy. There was a
      significant and sustained increase in 25-OHD levels at all of the time points
      compared with baseline (40.8 +/- 7.5 nmol/L), 1 month (145.6 +/- 51.8 nmol/L), 3 
      months (87.1 +/- 28.4 nmol/L), and 6 months 69.2 +/- 31.3 nmol/L). There were no 
      significant changes in serum calcium, phosphate, or parathyroid hormone at any
      time points. CONCLUSIONS: Stoss therapy safely and effectively achieved and
      maintained a level of 25-OHD >50 nmol/L during 6 months in these children with
      IBD. Further prospective studies are now required to confirm this finding and
      establish whether this intervention has other benefits.

TI  - Killing of Escherichia coli by Crohn's Disease Monocyte-derived Macrophages and
      Its Enhancement by Hydroxychloroquine and Vitamin D.
PG  - 1499-510

AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with defective innate immunity,
      including impaired neutrophil chemotaxis, and mucosal invasion by bacteria,
      particularly adherent and invasive Escherichia coli that replicate inside
      macrophage phagolysosomes. We compared CD and healthy control (HC) macrophages
      for their abilities to kill E. coli and generate neutrophil chemoattractants and 
      also assessed the effects of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and vitamin D on killing of
      phagocytosed E. coli. METHODS: Peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages from
      CD and HC were compared for bacterial killing and generation of neutrophil
      chemoattractants in response to CD-derived E. coli. Escherichia coli replication 
      was also assessed in the presence and absence of HCQ, alone and with antibiotics,
      and vitamin D. RESULTS: Monocyte-derived macrophages from patients with CD were
      similar to HC in allowing replication of phagocytosed CD-derived E. coli: HM605
      {CD: N = 10, mean fold replication in 3 hr = 1.08 (95% confidence interval [CI], 
      0.39-1.78); HC: N = 9, 1.50 (95% CI, 1.02-1.97); P = 0.15} and also in generation
      of neutrophil chemoattractants in response to E. coli (mean fold chemotaxis
      relative to control: CD = 2.55 [95% CI, 2.31-2.80]; HC = 2.65 [95% CI,
      2.46-2.85], P = 0.42). HCQ and 1,25 OH2-vitamin D3 both caused dose-dependent
      inhibition of intramacrophage E. coli replication 3-hour postinfection; HCQ:
      73.9% inhibition (P < 0.001) at 1 mug/mL, accompanied by raised intraphagosomal
      pH, and 1,25 OH2-vitamin D3: 80.7% inhibition (P < 0.05) at 80 nM. HCQ had
      synergistic effects with doxycycline and ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: CD and HC
      macrophages perform similarly in allowing replication of phagocytosed E. coli and
      generating neutrophil chemoattractants. Replication of phagocytosed E. coli was
      substantially decreased by HCQ and vitamin D. These warrant further therapeutic
      trials in CD in combination with relevant antibiotics.

TI  - Consumption of vegetables and fruit and the risk of inflammatory bowel disease: a
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 623-30
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0000000000000330 [doi]
AB  - To date, associations between consumption of vegetables and fruit and the risk of
      inflammatory bowel disease have been a controversial subject. Therefore, we
      carried out a meta-analysis to evaluate the associations. A comprehensive search 
      was performed in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the China National Knowledge
      Infrastructure to identify all relevant studies. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with
      95% confidence intervals (CIs) from random-effects or fixed-effects models were
      calculated. Publication bias was estimated using Egger's test and the funnel
      plot. A total of 14 case-control studies were included in this meta-analysis. On 
      the basis of the highest versus the lowest analysis, consumption of vegetables
      was associated inversely with the risk of ulcerative colitis (UC) (OR=0.71, 95%
      CI 0.58-0.88, n=9 studies), but not with Crohn's disease (CD) (OR=0.66, 95% CI
      0.40-1.09, n=8 studies). Higher consumption of fruit was associated inversely
      with the risk of UC (OR=0.69, 95% CI 0.49-0.96, n=8 studies) and CD (OR=0.57, 95%
      CI 0.44-0.74, n=10 studies). For intake of vegetables and the risk of CD,
      subgroup analysis showed a significant association for studies carried out in
      Europe (OR=0.36, 95% CI 0.23-0.57), but not in Asia (OR=1.00, 95% CI 0.50-2.03). 
      No significant publication bias was found for the analysis of intake of
      vegetables and the risk of UC, intake of fruit and the risk of UC, and intake of 
      vegetables and the risk of CD. This meta-analysis indicates that consumption of
      vegetables and fruit might be associated inversely with the risk of UC and CD,
      and the results need to be further confirmed.

      immunoglobulin.
PG  - 3361-6
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v21.i11.3361 [doi]
AB  - Oral prescription medical foods have long been used in hospital settings but are 
      also appropriate therapies for gastrointestinal disorders in outpatient medical
      practice. Oral serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate (SBI) has been
      shown in clinical studies to reduce loose stools and improve stool consistency as
      well as other symptoms (i.e., abdominal pain, bloating, and urgency) in patients 
      with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) and human immunodeficiency
      virus-associated enteropathy. This case series reports the outcomes of 14 IBS
      patients who received SBI as an addition to standard of care at an individual
      physician's clinical practice. The patients: 2 IBS with constipation (IBS-C), 7
      IBS-D, 2 mixed diarrhea and constipation IBS (IBS-M) and 3 undefined IBS (IBS-U; 
      also described by some physicians as IBS-Bloating), ranged in age from 22-87
      years. SBI (5 g or 10 g daily dose) was added to the patient's current standard
      care and followed for several weeks to determine if symptoms were improved with
      the addition of SBI. Overall, 12 of the 14 patients indicated some level of
      improvement through direct questioning of the patients regarding changes from the
      prior visit. One IBS-Bloating patient had a resolution of symptoms and two
      patients (1 IBS-Bloating and 1 IBS-C) discontinued therapy because of
      insufficient relief. The 12 patients who continued on therapy reported an overall
      improvement in symptoms with better stool consistency, decreased frequency as
      well as reductions in abdominal pain, bloating, distention, and incontinence. In 
      most cases, therapeutic effects of SBI were seen within the first four weeks of
      therapy with continued improvements at subsequent visits. SBI has a multifaceted 
      mechanism of action and may help to manage IBS by providing a distinct protein
      source required to normalize bowel function, gastrointestinal microbiota, and
      nutritionally enhance tight junction protein expression between intestinal
      epithelial cells. SBI as a medical food provides a safe option for patients with 
      IBS-D but may have application in other forms of IBS.

TI  - Whey and soy protein supplements changes body composition in patients with
      Crohn's disease undergoing azathioprine and anti-TNF-alpha therapy.
PG  - 1603-10
LID - 10.3305/nh.2015.31.4.8362 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic transmural inflammation of the
      gastrointestinal tract of unknown cause. Malnutrition associated with active CD
      has been reduced although obesity has increased. Dietary strategies such as those
      with high-protein have been proposed to reduce body fat. This study compares the 
      effects of two supplements on the nutritional status of CD patients. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: 68 CD patients were randomized in two groups: whey protein group
      (WP) and soy protein group (SP). Using bioimpedance analysis, anthropometry and
      albumin and pre-albumin dosages the nutritional status was measured before
      starting the intervention and after 8 and 16 weeks. The disease activity was
      determined by Crohn's Disease Activity Index and serum C-reactive protein dosage 
      and dietary intake by 24h dietary recalls. RESULTS: Forty-one patients concluded 
      the study and both supplements changed body composition similarly. Triceps skin
      fold thickness (p< 0.001) and body fat percentage (p=0.001) decreased, whereas
      mid-arm muscle circumference (p=0.004), corrected arm muscle area (p=0.005) and
      body lean percentage (p=0.001) increased. CONCLUSIONS: For Crohn's disease
      patients undergoing anti TNF-alpha and azatioprine therapies, supplementation
      with whey and soy proteins changes body composition through reduction of body fat
      and thus contributes to control inflammation.

TI  - Well-defined and reliable clinical outcome assessments for pediatric Crohn
      disease: a critical need for drug development.
PG  - 729-36
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000793 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to identify areas for further
      development of clinical outcome assessment (COA) in pediatric Crohn disease (CD).
      METHODS: The study analyzed the measurement properties of all existing COA tools 
      for pediatric CD in literature and published registration trials of approved
      drugs for pediatric CD based on criteria described in Food and Drug
      Administration guidance for patient-reported outcome (PRO) development. RESULTS: 
      The Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) and its derivatives
      (abbreviated, short, modified, and weighted PCDAIs) were reviewed. The Crohn's
      Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and Harvey-Bradshaw index (HBI), designed for adult
      patients, have been adapted for use in a few pediatric CD studies. The use of
      PCDAI as an endpoint in Remicade and Humira trials led to the Food and Drug
      Administration-approved indication in pediatric CD. Common issues in measurement 
      properties of COA tools included the absence of direct patient or caregivers'
      input to generate the items measuring signs and symptoms; absence of evidence
      demonstrating correlation with clinically relevant inflammation observed with
      endoscopic measures; lack of standardization in measurement, age-appropriate
      interviewer script, and response rating criteria for the physician interviewer.
      CONCLUSIONS: Available evidence indicates that CDAI, HBI, and 5 versions of the
      PCDAI lack adequate measurement properties for use as a primary endpoint for
      phase 3 trials intended to support approval of products intended to treat
      pediatric CD. In order to facilitate pediatric drug development, a well-defined, 
      reliable, sensitive, and globally recognized PRO that measures signs and symptoms
      in children with CD and that can be used in conjunction with endoscopy-based
      endpoints and/or biomarkers is sorely needed.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex, multi-factorial disease thought to
      arise from an inappropriate immune response to commensal bacteria in a
      genetically susceptible person that results in chronic, cyclical, intestinal
      inflammation. Dietary and environmental factors are implicated in the initiation 
      and perpetuation of IBD; however, a singular causative agent has not been
      identified. As of now, the role of environmental priming or triggers in IBD onset
      and pathogenesis are not well understood, but these factors appear to synergize
      with other disease susceptibility factors. In previous work, we determined that
      the polysaccharide dietary additive, maltodextrin (MDX), impairs cellular
      anti-bacterial responses and suppresses intestinal anti-microbial defense
      mechanisms. In this addendum, we review potential mechanisms for dietary
      deregulation of intestinal homeostasis, postulate how dietary and genetic risk
      factors may combine to result in disease pathogenesis, and discuss these ideas in
      the context of recent findings related to dietary interventions for IBD.

      interventions on the microbiome?
PG  - 781-95

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis, is a chronic, relapsing and remitting set of conditions characterized by
      an excessive inflammatory response leading to the destruction of the
      gastrointestinal tract. While the exact etiology of inflammatory bowel disease
      remains unclear, increasing evidence suggests that the human gastrointestinal
      microbiome plays a critical role in disease pathogenesis. Manipulation of the gut
      microbiome has therefore emerged as an attractive alternative for both
      prophylactic and therapeutic intervention against inflammation. Despite its
      growing popularity among patients, review of the current literature suggests that
      the adult microbiome is a highly stable structure resilient to short-term
      interventions. In fact, most evidence to date demonstrates that therapeutic
      agents targeting the microflora trigger rapid changes in the microbiome, which
      then reverts to its pre-treatment state once the therapy is completed. Based on
      these findings, our ability to treat inflammatory bowel disease through
      short-term manipulations of the human microbiome may only have a transient
      effect. Thus, this review is intended to highlight the use of various therapeutic
      options, including diet, pre- and probiotics, antibiotics and fecal microbiota
      transplant, to manipulate the microbiome, with specific attention to the
      alterations made to the microflora along with the duration of impact.

TI  - High prevalence of vitamin A deficiency in Crohn's disease patients according to 
      serum retinol levels and the relative dose-response test.
PG  - 1614-20
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v21.i5.1614 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To assess the vitamin A status of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) by
      evaluating serum retinol levels and the relative dose response (RDR) test (liver 
      retinol stores). METHODS: Vitamin A nutritional status was measured by serum
      retinol obtained by high performance liquid chromatography and the RDR test for
      evaluation of the hepatic stores. Body composition was performed by densitometry 
      by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Vitamin A dietary intake was assessed from a
      semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: This study included 38
      CD patients and 33 controls. Low serum retinol concentrations were detected in
      29% of CD patients vs 15% in controls (P < 0.005). The RDR test was positive in
      37% of CD patients vs 12% in controls, which indicated inadequate hepatic vitamin
      A stores (P < 0.005). Individuals with hypovitaminosis A had lower BMI and body
      fat compared with those without this deficiency. There was no association between
      vitamin A deficiency and its dietary intake, ileal location, presence of disease 
      activity and prior bowel resections. CONCLUSION: Patients with CD have higher
      prevalence of vitamin A deficiency, as assessed by two independent methods.

TI  - High amount of dietary fiber not harmful but favorable for Crohn disease.
PG  - 58-61
LID - 10.7812/TPP/14-124 [doi]
AB  - Current chronic diseases are a reflection of the westernized diet that features a
      decreased consumption of dietary fiber. Indigestible dietary fiber is metabolized
      by gut bacteria, including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, to butyrate, which has a
      critical role in colonic homeostasis owing to a variety of functions. Dietary
      fiber intake has been significantly inversely associated with the risk of chronic
      diseases. Crohn disease (CD) is not an exception. However, even authors who
      reported the inverse association between dietary fiber and a risk of CD made no
      recommendation of dietary fiber intake to CD patients. Some correspondence was
      against advocating high fiber intake in CD. We initiated a semivegetarian diet
      (SVD), namely a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet, for patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease. Our SVD contains 32.4 g of dietary fiber in 2000 kcal. There was no
      untoward effect of the SVD. The remission rate with combined infliximab and SVD
      for newly diagnosed CD patients was 100%. Maintenance of remission on SVD without
      scheduled maintenance therapy with biologic drugs was 92% at 2 years. These
      excellent short- and long-term results can be explained partly by SVD. The fecal 
      bacterial count of F prausnitzii in patients with CD is significantly lower than 
      in healthy controls. Diet reviews recommend plant-based diets to treat and to
      prevent a variety of chronic diseases. SVD belongs to plant-based diets that
      inevitably contain considerable amounts of dietary fiber. Our clinical experience
      and available data provide a rationale to recommend a high fiber intake to treat 
      CD.

TI  - Electrophysiological and microperimetry changes in vitamin A deficiency
      retinopathy.
PG  - 231-40
LID - 10.1007/s10633-015-9484-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe a follow-up case of vitamin A deficiency (VAD)-related
      retinopathy with macular involvement monitored with electroretinography and
      microperimetry. METHODS: Flash (ERG), pattern (PERG), and multifocal (mfERG)
      electroretinography were recorded in parallel with microperimetry before and
      during 7-month follow-up of vitamin A treatment on a 65-year-old man presented
      with a 1-year history of night blindness. The patient had undergone ileostomy
      procedure for Crohn's disease 14 years ago. His best corrected visual acuity was 
      6/6 in each eye. Fundus examination revealed macular and mid-peripheral
      yellow-white lesions compatible with drusen. RESULTS: Before treatment, PERG was 
      reduced, and mfERG was reduced and delayed, worse in responses from the central
      rings. These results revealed evidence of bilateral macular and central cone
      dysfunction. The flash ERG showed reduced dark-adapted 0.01 ERG (rod response);
      a-wave of dark-adapted 3.0 and 10.0 ERG was normal but b-wave was reduced
      (negative configuration); light-adapted 3.0 ERG was slightly reduced. The flash
      ERG revealed evidence of bilateral generalised retinal dysfunction affecting the 
      rod more than cone system. Microperimetry showed deep reduction in retinal
      sensitivity. Fixation stability was unstable with eccentric locus. During
      treatment, ERG and microperimetry demonstrated significant improvements. Fixation
      stability reached normal values after the third treatment week. CONCLUSIONS: This
      case illustrates the importance of electrophysiological investigation in early
      VAD-related retinopathy detection correlated with microperimetry. Our findings
      indicate a more delayed central cone function recovery than that of generalised
      rod and cone function. There was a marked correlation between ERG and
      microperimetric changes.

TI  - Baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) antigen in obese and normal weight
      subjects.
PG  - 42-7
LID - 10.1111/cob.12079 [doi]
AB  - Baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and its cell wall components have been
      used as one of the alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters in the feed
      industry. Antibodies to cell wall mannan of this yeast (ASCA) have been
      traditionally used in the study of Crohn's disease (CD). We applied ASCA in
      relation to obesity. This study aims (i) to determine the concentration of ASCA
      (immunoglobulin A [IgA] and immunoglobulin G [IgG]) in obese compared with normal
      weight individuals and (ii) to determine if there is a correlation between ASCA
      concentrations, obesity indices and C-reactive protein. Forty obese individuals
      (body mass index [BMI] > 35 kg m(-2) ) and 18 healthy (BMI < 25 kg m(-2) )
      volunteers participated in this case-control study. Binding activity of serum IgA
      and IgG to the cell wall mannan of S. cerevisiae was measured by enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay. More than one-third of the obese individual (35%) showed
      elevated titres of ASCA compared with the control group (5%). This antibody was
      positively associated with weight (P = 0.01), BMI (P = 0.02) and waist
      circumference (P = 0.02), but not with C-reactive protein. It seems that ASCA are
      not only specific for CD but are also associated with obesity. S. cerevisiae or a
      related antigen may play a role in the matrix of this complex condition.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In neonatal units, Salmonella infections have been attributed to
      food-borne sources and person to person transmission. METHODS: The outbreak
      described is the first reported by Salmonella enterica serotype Newport in a
      neonatal facility in Spain. RESULTS: The index case was an 8-day premature
      newborn that developed clinical sepsis with positive blood cultures. The outbreak
      source was the mother of the index case. CONCLUSIONS: It is essential to improve 
      infection control measures taking into account the parents, as they can be an
      important source of infection.

TI  - Transfer of natalizumab into breast milk in a mother with multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 233-6
LID - 10.1177/0890334414566237 [doi]
AB  - Natalizumab (Tysabri) is a recombinant humanized antibody to alpha4-integrin that
      is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of multiple
      sclerosis (MS) and Crohn disease. This is a case report of a 28-year-old woman
      with MS who was taking natalizumab (300 mg intravenously infused over 1 hour
      every 4 weeks) while breastfeeding her 11.5-month-old daughter 3 times a day.
      Breast milk samples were collected over a 50-day period after the patient's first
      drug infusion. The average concentration of natalizumab was 0.93 microg/mL/d, and
      the relative infant dose was 1.74% of the weight-adjusted maternal dose. Transfer
      of natalizumab into human milk increased over time and with subsequent
      injections, with the highest concentration of 2.83 microg/mL at day 50 with a
      relative infant dose of 5.3%. Because these data suggest continued accumulation
      of natalizumab in milk, and because we cannot provide an accurate assessment of
      levels of this drug at 24 weeks (steady state), we are unable to determine safety
      at this time.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Muscle wasting or sarcopenia arising from chronic inflammation is
      found in 60% of patients with Crohn's disease. Transcriptional protein NF-kappaB 
      reduces muscle formation through MyoD transcription and increases muscle
      breakdown by proteolysis. AIM: As TNF is a potent activator of NF-kappaB, and
      anti-TNF agent infliximab (IFX) prevents NF-kappaB activation, to determine
      whether or not Crohn's patients treated with IFX gain muscle volume and strength.
      METHODS: We performed a prospective, repeated-measures cohort study in adult
      Crohn's disease patients with an acute disease flare. Patients were instructed
      not to vary diet or activity. Concomitant medications were kept stable. At week 1
      (pre-treatment), week 16 (post-IFX induction) and week 25 (post-first IFX
      maintenance dose), we assessed (i) MRI volume of quadriceps femoris at anatomical
      mid-thigh; (ii) maximal concentric quadriceps contractions strength at three
      specific speeds of contraction; (iii) physical activity by validated instrument
      (IPAQ); (iv) Three-day food record of intake and composition (food-weighing
      method); (v) Serum levels of IL6. RESULTS: Nineteen patients (58% female; mean
      age 33.2 +/- 10.7 years) were recruited. IFX increased muscle volume in both legs
      from baseline (right, 1505 cm(3) ) to week 25 (right, 1569 cm(3) ; P = 0.010).
      IFX also increased muscle strength in both legs from baseline (right 30 degrees
      /s, 184.8 Nm) to week 25 (right 30 degrees /s, 213.6 Nm; P = 0.002). Muscle
      volume gain correlated with male gender (P = 0.003). Significant gains in muscle 
      volume and strength were unrelated to prednisolone use. Serum IL6 levels
      decreased by week 25 (P = 0.037). CONCLUSION: The anti-TNF agent infliximab
      reverses inflammatory sarcopenia in patients with Crohn's disease.

AB  - Diet may be a successful part of the treatment plan for improving outcome in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study aimed to
      systematically review all published clinical trials evaluating the effects of a
      regular diet on symptoms of IBD. Three medical databases were searched for
      clinical trials evaluating an intervention that involved dietary manipulation
      using a regular diet on adults with IBD whose symptoms were objectively measured 
      before and after the intervention. The most common types of regular diet
      interventions that we observed in the literature fell into the following three
      categories: low residue/low fiber diets, exclusion diets, or other specific
      diets. Of all included studies, the few that were of higher quality and that
      observed a statistically significant improvement in symptoms in the diet group
      compared to the control group fell under the exclusion diet group or the other
      specific diet group. We were able to identify several high quality clinical
      trials evaluating dietary manipulations on symptoms of IBD. Exclusion diets and
      the low FODMAP diet are two areas identified in this review that show promise for
      having therapeutic benefits for patients with IBD.

TI  - Optimal vitamin D levels in Crohn's disease: a review.
PG  - 56-66
LID - 10.1017/S0029665114001591 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin D deficiency is common among patients with Crohn's disease. Serum
      25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) is the best measure of an individual's vitamin D
      status and current cut-off ranges for sufficiency are debatable. Several factors 
      contribute to vitamin D deficiency in Crohn's disease. These include inadequate
      exposure to sunlight, inadequate dietary intake, impaired conversion of vitamin D
      to its active metabolite, increased catabolism, increased excretion and genetic
      variants in vitamin D hydroxylation and transport. The effects of low 25(OH)D on 
      outcomes other than bone health are understudied in Crohn's disease. The aim of
      the present review is to discuss the potential roles of vitamin D and the
      possible levels required to achieve them. Emerging evidence suggests that vitamin
      D may have roles in innate and adaptive immunity, in the immune-pathogenesis of
      Crohn's disease, prevention of Crohn's disease-related hospitalisations and
      surgery, in reducing disease severity and in colon cancer prevention. The present
      literature appears to suggest that 25(OH)D concentrations of >/=75 nmol/l may be 
      required for non-skeletal effects; however, further research on optimal levels is
      required.

TI  - Vitamin D as a novel therapy in inflammatory bowel disease: new hope or false
      dawn?
PG  - 5-12
LID - 10.1017/S0029665114001621 [doi]
AB  - There is increasing scientific interest in the field of vitamin D research,
      moving the focus beyond bone health to other disease processes. Low circulating
      vitamin D levels have been reported as a risk factor for several
      pathophysiologically divergent diseases, including cancers, diabetes, CVD,
      multiple sclerosis and inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and 
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). But, therein, remains the challenge: can any
      single nutrient contribute to multiple complex disease mechanisms and,
      ultimately, have therapeutic potential? The aim of this review is to critically
      evaluate several strands of scientific evidence surrounding vitamin D and
      inflammation, primarily focusing on IBD. Epidemiological studies suggest an
      increased incidence of IBD and rheumatoid arthritis in countries of more northern
      latitudes, mirroring sunlight patterns. A considerable body of evidence supports 
      the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D, at least in animal models of IBD.
      Although it is accepted that suboptimal vitamin D status is common in IBD, some
      studies suggest that this associates with more severe disease. With regard to
      treatment, the data are only beginning to emerge from randomised controlled
      trials to suggest that people with IBD may remain in remission longer when
      treated with oral vitamin D. In conclusion, several strands of evidence suggest
      that vitamin D may modify the immune response in IBD. There is a continued need
      for large well-designed clinical trials and mechanistic studies to determine if, 
      and how, this emerging promise translates into tangible clinical benefits for
      people with chronic debilitating diseases such as IBD.

AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are intestinal disorders that
      comprise the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). These disorders have a
      significant effect on the quality of life of affected patients and the increasing
      number of IBD cases worldwide is a growing concern. Because of the overall burden
      of IBD and its multifactorial etiology, efforts have been made to improve the
      medical management of these inflammatory conditions. The classical therapeutic
      strategies aim to control the exacerbated host immune response with
      aminosalicylates, antibiotics, corticosteroids, thiopurines, methotrexate and
      anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) biological agents. Although successful in the
      treatment of several CD or UC conditions, these drugs have limited effectiveness,
      and variable responses may culminate in unpredictable outcomes. The ideal therapy
      should reduce inflammation without inducing immunosuppression, and remains a
      challenge to health care personnel. Recently, a number of additional approaches
      to IBD therapy, such as new target molecules for biological agents and cellular
      therapy, have shown promising results. A deeper understanding of IBD pathogenesis
      and the availability of novel therapies are needed to improve therapeutic
      success. This review describes the overall key features of therapies currently
      employed in clinical practice as well as novel and future alternative IBD
      treatment methods.

AB  - We have identified a range of food phytochemicals that inhibit Janus Kinase 2
      (JAK2) and Adenosine Monophosphate Kinase (AMPK). A mutated and dysregulated form
      of JAK2, a tyrosine kinase, is associated with several diseases including Crohn's
      disease. Using an in vitro, time-resolved fluorescence (TR-FRET) assay, we tested
      49 different types of food extracts, plus 10 concentrated fractions of increasing
      hydrophobicity from each extract, to find foods containing JAK2 inhibitors. The
      food extracts tested included grains, meat, fish, shellfish, dairy products,
      herbs, mushrooms, hops, fruits and vegetables. Several fruits were potent
      inhibitors of JAK2: blackberry, boysenberry, feijoa, pomegranate, rosehip and
      strawberry, which all contain ellagitannins, known inhibitors of kinases. These
      fruits are in the Rosales and Myrtales plant orders. No other foods gave >1% of
      the maximal JAK2 inhibitory activities of these fruits. AMPK, a sensor and
      regulator of energy metabolism in cells, is a serine-threonine kinase which is
      reported to be activated by various flavonoid phytochemicals. Using a TR-FRET
      assay, we tested various fruit extracts for AMPK activation and inhibition.
      Ellagitannin containing foods scored highly as AMPK inhibitors. Despite several
      reports of AMPK activation in whole cells by phytochemicals, no extracts or pure 
      compounds activated AMPK in our assay.

TI  - The probiotic VSL#3 has anti-inflammatory effects and could reduce endoscopic
      recurrence after surgery for Crohn's disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Probiotic formulations of single species of bacteria have not 
      been effective in preventing the recurrence of Crohn's disease after surgery. We 
      investigated the ability of VSL#3, a mixture of 8 different bacterial probiotic
      species, to prevent Crohn's disease recurrence after surgery in a multicenter,
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. METHODS: Within 30 days of
      ileocolonic resection and re-anastomosis, patients with Crohn's disease were
      randomly assigned to groups given 1 sachet of VSL#3 (900 billion viable bacteria,
      comprising 4 strains of Lactobacillus, 3 strains of Bifidobacterium, and 1 strain
      of Streptococcus salivarius subspecies thermophilus) (n = 59) or matching placebo
      (n = 60). Colonoscopy was performed at days 90 and 365 to evaluate the
      neoterminal ileum for disease recurrence and obtain mucosal biopsies for cytokine
      analysis. Patients from both groups with either no or mild endoscopic recurrence 
      at day 90 received VSL#3 until day 365. The primary outcome was the proportion of
      patients with severe endoscopic recurrence at day 90. RESULTS: At day 90, the
      proportion of patients with severe endoscopic lesions did not differ
      significantly between VSL#3 (9.3%) and placebo (15.7%, P = .19). The proportions 
      of patients with non-severe lesions at day 90 who had severe endoscopic
      recurrence at day 365 were 10.0% in the early VSL#3 group (given VSL#3 for the
      entire 365 days) and 26.7% in the late VSL#3 group (given VSL#3 from days 90
      through 365) (P = .09). Aggregate rates of severe recurrence (on days 90 and 365)
      were not statistically different, 20.5% of subjects in the early VSL#3 group and 
      42.1% in the late VSL#3 group. Patients receiving VSL#3 had reduced mucosal
      inflammatory cytokine levels compared with placebo at day 90 (P < .05). Crohn's
      disease activity index and inflammatory bowel disease quality of life scores were
      similar in the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: There were no statistical differences in
      endoscopic recurrence rates at day 90 between patients who received VSL#3 and
      patients who received placebo. Lower mucosal levels of inflammatory cytokines and
      a lower rate of recurrence among patients who received early VSL#3 (for the
      entire 365 days) indicate that this probiotic should be further investigated for 
      prevention of Crohn's disease recurrence. Clinical trials.gov number:

TI  - Prebiotics and probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel
      disease in children.
PG  - 209-17
LID - 10.3920/BM2014.0067 [doi]
AB  - Underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a
      common disorder characterized by abdominal pain associated to a change in stool
      consistency or frequency, include low-grade inflammation and intestinal
      microbiota changes. Few and disappointing data are available for prebiotics. A
      few controlled trials (RCTs) of probiotics are instead available with favourable 
      effects, although most are limited by suboptimal design and small sample size. A 
      recent report from the Rome foundation group included 32 RCTs of probiotics, most
      of which showed an overall modest improvement in symptoms, with the patients most
      benefitting from probiotics being those with predominant diarrhoea and those
      having a post-infectious IBS. A review focusing only on children with functional 
      gastrointestinal disorders concluded that probiotics are more effective than
      placebo in the treatment of patients with abdominal pain-related functional
      gastrointestinal disorders, although no effect on constipation was evident. The
      role for probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) appears logical: the
      endogenous intestinal microbiota plays a central role in their development, and
      various probiotics have been found effective in animal models of IBD. However,
      research in humans has been overall quite limited, and it would seem that after a
      phase of intense research in the first decade of this century, the pace has
      slowed down, with fewer clinical trials been published in the past 2-3 years. To 
      summarize current evidence: no probiotic has proven successful in Crohn's
      disease. In ulcerative colitis, on the other hand, data are more promising, and a
      very recent meta-analysis, that included 23 randomized controlled trials,
      concluded that there is evidence of efficacy for the probiotic mixture VSL#3 in
      helping inducing and maintaining remission, as well as in maintaining remission
      in patients with pouchitis. It is fair to state that for both IBD and IBS, more
      well-designed, rigorous, randomized clinical trials must be performed.

TI  - The course of anaemia in children and adolescents with Crohn's disease included
      in a prospective registry.
PG  - 51-6
LID - 10.1007/s00384-014-2042-4 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence and evolution of
      anaemia in prospectively followed children and adolescents diagnosed with Crohn's
      disease (CD). METHODS: The BELCRO registry (inclusion May 2008-April 2010),
      describing current clinical treatment practice of children diagnosed with CD,
      provided data on age, height, body mass index (BMI), paediatric Crohn's disease
      activity index (PCDAI), therapy and haemoglobin (Hb) at diagnosis 12 and 24
      months follow-up. Anaemia was defined as Hb < -2 sd, while severe anaemia was
      defined as Hb < -4 sd. Patients were classified as child </=13 and adolescent >13
      years of age. RESULT: Ninety-six were included, 13 dropped out due to
      insufficient Hb data (37 females/46 males; median age 13.3 years, range 2.2-17.8 
      years). At diagnosis, the median Hb sd was -2.66 (-8.4; 1.07) and was correlated 
      with the PCDAI (p = 0.013). At diagnosis, 51/83 (61%) were anaemic and all had
      active disease. Hb z-score significantly improved (p < 0.0001) but 26/68 (38%)
      remained anaemic at 12 months and 29/76 (38%) at 24 months of follow-up. The
      correlation to the PCDAI disappeared. At 24 months, children were more likely to 
      be anaemic. There was no difference in iron dose nor duration of iron supplements
      between children and adolescents. Iron treatment was more readily given to
      patients presenting with anaemia. Hb did not differ between patients with (n =
      28) or without iron supplements. Half of the patients with persisting anaemia
      were given iron supplements, of which, only three were given intravenously.
      CONCLUSION: Anaemia remains an important extra-intestinal manifestation of CD in 
      children. Physicians, lacking optimal treatment strategies, undertreat their
      patients.

AB  - The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease, 
      is a subject of increasing interest. Loss-of-function mutations in
      nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) are strong 
      genetic factors linked to Crohn's disease, which eventually leads to an excessive
      mucosal inflammatory response directed against components of normal gut
      microbiota. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in inflammation 
      processes, as well as in transduction of signals from receptors for several
      cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). ROS activate nuclear
      factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) via IkappaB kinase (IKK) through the PI3K/AKT/PTEN
      pathway. Therefore, this pathway is recognized to play a key role in Crohn's
      disease. Loss of function has been demonstrated to occur as an early event in a
      wide variety of diseases. Given this prevalent involvement in a number of
      diseases, the molecular development that modulates this pathway has been the
      subject of several studies. In addition, it has been the focus of extensive
      research and drug discovery activities. A better understanding of the molecular
      assemblies may reveal novel targets for the therapeutic development against
      Crohn's disease.

TI  - A retrospective analysis: the development of patient reported outcome measures
      for the assessment of Crohn's disease activity.
PG  - 77-86
LID - 10.1111/apt.13001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is a measure of disease
      activity based on symptoms, signs and a laboratory test. The US Food and Drug
      Administration has indicated that patient reported outcomes (PROs) should be the 
      primary outcome in randomised controlled trials for Crohn's disease (CD). AIM: As
      no validated PRO exists for CD, to investigate whether CDAI diary card items
      could be modified for this purpose. METHODS: Data from a trial of
      rifaximin-extended intestinal release were used to identify cut-points for stool 
      frequency, pain and general well-being using receiver operating characteristic
      curves with CDAI <150 as criterion. The operating properties of 2- and 3-item PRO
      were evaluated using data from a trial of methotrexate in CD. Regression analysis
      determined PRO2 and PRO3 scores that correspond to CDAI-defined thresholds of
      150, 220 and 450 and changes of 50, 70 and 100 points. RESULTS: Optimum
      cut-points for CDAI remission were mean daily stool frequency </=1.5, abdominal
      pain </=1, and general well-being score of </=1 (areas under the ROC curve 0.79, 
      0.91 and 0.89, respectively). The effect estimates were similar using 2- and
      3-item PROs or CDAI. PRO2 and PRO3 values corresponding to CDAI scores of 150,
      220 and 450 points were 8, 14, 34 and 13, 22, 53. The corresponding values for
      CDAI changes of 50, 70 and 100, were 2, 5, 8 and 5, 9, 14. Responsiveness to
      change was similar for both PROs. CONCLUSION: Patient reported outcomes derived
      from CDAI diary items may be appropriate for use in clinical trials for CD.

TI  - Validation of predictive equations for resting energy expenditure in Japanese
      pediatric Crohn's disease patients: preliminary study.
PG  - 290-4
LID - 10.1111/ped.12504 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Predictive equations are often used to estimate resting energy
      expenditure (REE). Determining the appropriate equation for different patient
      types, however, remains inconclusive, as in the case of Japanese children with
      Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this study was to identify an appropriate
      predictive equation for measuring REE in Japanese children with CD. METHODS:
      Twelve Japanese children with CD managed at the National Center for Child Health 
      and Development in Tokyo, Japan, were studied. REE (kcal/day) was measured using 
      indirect calorimetry. The predictive equations used were the Japanese Dietary
      Reference Intakes (2010), the Schofield equation, the Food and Agriculture
      Organization/World Health Organization/United Nations University (FAO/WHO/UNU)
      equation and the Cunningham equation. Difference between predicted and measured
      REE was analyzed on Bland-Altman plot. RESULTS: Japanese Dietary Reference
      Intakes (2010) had the smallest difference between predicted and measured REE.
      Weight was the primary predictor of REE on multiple regression analysis. As well,
      Japanese Dietary Reference Intakes (2010) had the highest ratio of weight to
      predicted REE (98.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Of the four equations, Japanese Dietary
      Reference Intakes (2010) appeared to be the most practical and accurate
      predictive equation for REE in Japanese children with CD.

TI  - Converging goals of treatment of inflammatory bowel disease from clinical trials 
      and practice.

AB  - It is important to have clear goals for treating inflammatory bowel disease in
      clinical practice and in research. Conventional end points for trials in
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease have been based on composite indices, such
      as the Mayo Clinic Score and the Crohn's Disease Activity Index; these indices
      incorporate symptoms, signs, and findings from laboratory tests and sometimes
      endoscopic assessments. Although definitions of clinical response and remission
      have been based on these indices for regulatory purposes, they are difficult to
      apply to practice because they are complex and not intuitive to clinicians. This 
      has caused a disconnect between clinical trials and practice. Recently, the use
      of composite indices in trials has been reevaluated in Food and Drug
      Administration-sponsored Gastroenterology Regulatory Endpoints and the
      Advancement of Therapeutics workshops due to concerns about the validity of the
      indices. Alternative measures of outcome and definitions of response are being
      developed. Patient-reported outcomes are psychometric instruments created and
      defined by patients to quantify symptoms. A combination of end points, comprising
      patient-reported outcomes and objective evaluation of inflammation by endoscopy, 
      offers a clinically meaningful and scientifically valid alternative to existing
      composite indices. Unlike composite indices, response definitions based on
      endoscopy and patient-reported outcomes can be readily applied in practice. This 
      convergence of outcome assessment in clinical trials and practice could expedite 
      implementation of "treat-to-target" algorithms, in which therapy is progressively
      intensified until a specific treatment goal is reached. This approach could
      improve patient care by reducing rates of disease-related complications, surgery,
      and hospitalization.

TI  - Food antigen-induced immune responses in Crohn's disease patients and
      experimental colitis mice.
PG  - 394-405
LID - 10.1007/s00535-014-0981-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Crohn's disease (CD), the involvement of food antigens in immune
      responses remains unclear. The objective of this study was to detect immune
      responses against food antigens in CD patients and examine the mechanism in a
      mouse model of colitis. METHODS: We enrolled 98 CD patients, 50 ulcerative
      colitis patients, and 52 healthy controls (HCs) to compare the levels of serum
      immunoglobulin (Ig)Gs against 88 foods. The presence of serum IgGs against foods 
      was also examined in interleukin (IL)-10 knockout (KO) mice in which CD4(+) T
      cell activation by antigenic food protein was assessed. Mice transferred with
      IL-10 KO cells received diets with or without food antigens, and the development 
      of colitis was evaluated. RESULTS: The prevalence of IgGs against various foods, 
      especially vegetables, grains, and nuts, was significantly higher in CD patients 
      than in HCs. Similarly, the prevalence of IgGs against food proteins was higher
      in IL-10 KO mice than in BALB/c mice. Beta-conglycinin, identified as an
      antigenic food proteins in IL-10 KO mice, induced CD4(+) T cell production of
      interferon-gamma and IL-17 through dendritic cell antigen presentation.
      Elimination of the food antigens ameliorated the development of colitis in mice
      without altering the composition of their intestinal microbiota. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      CD colitis mice, intestinal inflammation via CD4(+) T cell hyperactivation was
      induced by food antigens associated with high serum IgG levels and was
      ameliorated by the elimination of food antigens. This disrupted immunological
      tolerance to food antigen, which might act as an exacerbating factor, remains to 
      be elucidated in CD patients.

TI  - Variable access to quality nutrition information regarding inflammatory bowel
      disease: a survey of patients and health professionals and objective examination 
      of written information.
PG  - 2501-12
LID - 10.1111/hex.12219 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) report a range of
      nutritional and dietary problems and high-quality written information should be
      available on these. There is little research investigating the availability and
      quality of such information for patients with IBD. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed
      the type and quality of written information on nutrition and diet available to
      patients with IBD and the opinions of patients and health professionals. SETTING 
      AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-two patients with IBD were recruited from a large
      gastroenterology outpatient centre in England. One hundred dietitians from across
      the United Kingdom were also recruited. METHODS: Face-to-face surveys were
      conducted with patients with IBD. Questions regarding the use, format and
      usefulness of dietary information received were probed. Dietitians were surveyed 
      regarding written dietary information used in clinical practice. Samples of
      IBD-specific dietary information used across the UK were objectively assessed
      using two validated tools. MAIN RESULTS: The majority of patients rated written
      information as 'good' or 'very good', with the most useful information relating
      to 'general diet and IBD'. Forty-nine (49%) dietitians reported gaps in written
      information available for patients with IBD. Fifty-three different samples of
      IBD-specific information sheets were returned, with widely variable objective
      quality ratings. Commercially produced written information scored greater than
      locally produced information (BMA tool, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patient access to
      high-quality, written, IBD-specific dietary information is variable. IBD-specific
      written nutrition information needs to be developed in accordance with validated 
      tools to empower patients, encourage self-management and overcome nutritional
      implications of IBD.

TI  - Diet-induced hypoxia responsive element demethylation increases CEACAM6
      expression, favouring Crohn's disease-associated Escherichia coli colonisation.
PG  - 428-37

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) are abnormally predominant
      on Crohn's disease (CD) ileal mucosa. AIEC strains adhere to enterocytes via
      interaction between type 1 pili and CEACAM6 receptors abnormally expressed on CD 
      ileal mucosa, leading to gut inflammation. We analysed whether epigenetic
      mechanisms are involved in the upregulation of CEACAM6 expression in intestinal
      epithelial cells (IECs). DESIGN: Methylation of CEACAM6 promoter was analysed
      using bisulfite sequencing and site-specific methylation by SnapShot. pCpGfree
      reporter system was used to analyse CEACAM6 promoter activity. Transgenic mice
      expressing human CEACAM6 fed either standard food or a low-methyl diet (LMD) were
      orally challenged with 10(9) AIEC LF82. After 3 days, gut-associated AIEC and
      proinflammatory cytokines were quantified. RESULTS: Analysis of CEACAM6 gene
      promoter revealed potentially methylated dinucleotide CpGs within
      HIF-1-responsive elements (HREs). Methylation levels of CpG within CEACAM6
      promoter were inversely correlated with CEACAM6 expression in IEC expressing
      various levels of CEACAM6. We show the critical role of HRE methylation and
      transcription factor HIF-1 in the regulation of CEACAM6 gene in IEC. This was
      confirmed in transgenic mice expressing human CEACAM6 fed a LMD. LMD-dependent
      HRE demethylation led to abnormal gut expression of CEACAM6, favouring AIEC
      colonisation and subsequent inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: HRE hypomethylation in
      CEACAM6 promoter correlates with high expression in IEC. Our findings suggest
      that abnormal DNA methylation leading to CEACAM6 increased expression and
      AIEC-mediated gut inflammation can be related to changes in nutritional habits,
      such as low intake in methyl donor molecules, leading to abnormal epigenetic
      marks in mouse model mimicking CD susceptibility.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteria play a role in the onset and perpetuation of intestinal
      inflammation in IBD. Compositional alterations may also change the metabolic
      capacities of the gut bacteria. OBJECTIVE: To examine the metabolic activity of
      the microbiota of patients with Crohn's disease (CD), UC or pouchitis compared
      with healthy controls (HC) and determine whether eventual differences might be
      related to the pathogenesis of the disease. METHODS: Faecal samples were obtained
      from 40 HC, 83 patients with CD, 68 with UC and 13 with pouchitis. Disease
      activity was assessed in CD using the Harvey-Bradshaw Index, in UC using the UC
      Disease Activity Index and in pouchitis using the Pouchitis Disease Activity
      Index. Metabolite profiles were analysed using gas chromatography-mass
      spectrometry. RESULTS: The number of metabolites identified in HC (54) was
      significantly higher than in patients with CD (44, p<0.001), UC (47, p=0.042) and
      pouchitis (43, p=0.036). Multivariate discriminant analysis predicted HC, CD, UC 
      and pouchitis group membership with high sensitivity and specificity. The levels 
      of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs: pentanoate, hexanoate, heptanoate, octanoate 
      and nonanoate), and of some protein fermentation metabolites, were significantly 
      decreased in patients with CD, UC and pouchitis. Hexanoate levels were inversely 
      correlated to disease activity in CD (correlation coefficient=-0.157, p=0.046),
      whereas a significant positive correlation was found between styrene levels and
      disease activity in UC (correlation coefficient=0.338, p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS:
      Faecal metabolic profiling in patients with IBD relative to healthy controls
      identified MCFAs as important metabolic biomarkers of disease-related changes.
