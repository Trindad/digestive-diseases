AB  - The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is classifying the Anti-Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) antibody (ASCA) test system into class II (special
      controls). The special control that will apply to this device is a guidance
      document entitled "Guidance for Industry and FDA Reviewers: Class II Special
      Control Guidance Document for Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae)
      Antibody (ASCA) Premarket Notifications." Elsewhere in this issue of the Federal 
      Register. FDA is announcing the availability of this guidance document. The
      agency is taking this action in response to a petition submitted under the
      Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) as amended by the Medical Device
      Amendments of 1976, the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990, and the Food and Drug
      Administration Modernization Act of 1997. The agency is classifying these devices
      into class II (special controls) in order to provide a reasonable assurance of
      the safety and effectiveness of the devices.

      with active Crohn's disease. It was well tolerated, and there were minimal side
      effects. At the mucosal site of disease there was macroscopic and histological
      improvement, together with evidence of downregulation of the pro-inflammatory
      cytokines IL-1 beta, IL-8, and IFN-gamma.

TI  - Responses of people with inflammatory bowel disease to foods consumed.
PG  - 160-7
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the reactions of people with IBD to foods
      consumed. A database was created to capture the season of data collection, the
      disease, the food, and the subject's reaction to each food. A 122-item food list 
      was used. Sixty patients with IBD (n = 33 persons with Crohn's disease, n = 27
      persons with ulcerative colitis) completed the questionnaire about foods and
      their reactions to the foods in the fall and spring representing summer and
      winter consumption. Foods that made the subjects feel better and worse were
      identified. Although the original purpose of the study was to assess people with 
      IBD as a group, it became apparent that reactions to foods were different
      according to whether a subject had Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Failure
      to distinguish between the two diseases and use only the pooled data made the
      data meaningless. The importance of this finding and themes related to foods that
      had a positive or negative effect on the subjects is discussed in this article.

TI  - [Oral nutritional supplements. Are they useful?].
PG  - 49-57
AB  - Oral nutritional supplements are products included in enteral nutrition,
      preferably used in hospital settings, although their use in the community is
      gradually increasing and in the United Kingdom has doubled in the last seven
      years, with prescriptions covering a wide range of the population from children
      to the elderly, and different pathologies affecting their nutritional status.
      There is, however, no consensus on the usefulness of oral nutritional supplements
      among these patients, so we do not have any recommendations for use. In this
      paper we have reviewed the various studies available in the literature in order
      to clarify the usefulness of these supplements in different contexts or
      pathologies.

TI  - Oral nutritional supplementation is effective in the maintenance of remission in 
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 769-74
AB  - BACKGROUND: Enteral feeding with either elemental or polymeric diets is an
      established primary therapy for active Crohn's disease. However, the role of
      supplementing normal food with elemental diet in the long-term management of
      Crohn's disease has hitherto not been explored. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A series of
      39 consecutive patients with Crohn's disease in clinical remission were studied. 
      Of these, 21 patients (Group 1) received oral nutritional supplementation, taken 
      in addition to their normal diet. Their outcome (relapse rate, Crohn's disease
      activity index, inflammatory markers) was compared with that of 18 patients
      (Group 2), who were maintained on a normal unrestricted diet over an observation 
      period of 12 months. RESULTS: A total of 17 patients (81%) tolerated the
      nutritional supplementation. On an intention-to-treat basis, 10 patients (48%)
      remained in remission for 12 months, compared to 4/18 (22%) patients in Group 2, 
      p<0.0003. Their Crohn's disease activity index and CRP remained stable while
      their weight and body mass index improved during the period of nutrition therapy 
      Seven patients in Group 1 and 14 in Group 2 relapsed at a mean of 7.4+/-0.9 and
      6.2+/-0.4 months, respectively. The response to nutrition supplement was
      independent of age, sex, disease duration or location. Four patients (19%) were
      intolerant to enteral feeding. CONCLUSIONS: Nutritional supplementation is safe, 
      well tolerated and effective in the long-term management of patients with
      quiescent Crohn's disease.

TI  - In situ hybridization method for studies of cell wall deficient M.
      paratuberculosis in tissue samples.
PG  - 513-8
AB  - Cell wall deficient forms of mycobacteria may be important in the pathogenesis of
      Crohn's disease and sarcoidosis. However, no method has been available to
      localize this type of organisms in tissue sections. We developed an in situ
      hybridization method for the demonstration of Mycobacterium paratuberculosis
      spheroplasts (cell wall deficient forms) in paraffin embedded tissue sections.M. 
      paratuberculosis spheroplasts were prepared by treatment with glycine and
      lysozyme. Pieces of beef were injected with the prepared spheroplasts. The
      samples were fixed in buffered formalin and paraffin embedded. A M.
      paratuberculosis-specific probe derived from the IS900 gene was used. Specificity
      was controlled by using an irrelevant probe and by hybridizing sections with
      spheroplasts from other bacteria. Beef samples injected with M. paratuberculosis 
      spheroplasts were the only samples that hybridized with the probe. Beef samples
      containing acid-fast or spheroplast forms of M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis as 
      well as the acid-fast forms of M. paratuberculosis did not hybridize with the
      probe. Unrelated bacterial controls, i.e. Helicobacter pylori and Escherichia
      coli were also negative in the assay. In situ hybridization with the IS900 probe 
      provides a specific way to localize M. paratuberculosis spheroplasts in tissue
      sections and may be useful for studies of the connection between M.
      paratuberculosis and Crohn's disease and sarcoidosis. The assay may also be
      valuable for studies on Johne's diseased animals.

      experiences of other authors as well as other papers have been analyzed. RESULTS:
      Magnesium participates in over 300 enzymatic reactions in the human organism. It 
      may be found in drinking water and food through which it is substituted.
      According to WHO, there is a good correlation between Ca++/Mg++ ratio in drinking
      water and frequency of cardiac events. Higher Mg++ quantity reduces coronary
      disease. Decreased Mg++ quantity in plasma has been registered in patients with
      acute myocardial infarction (AMI), coronary patients and patients with heart
      failure. Various rhythm disturbances, particularly Torsade de points are related 
      to hypomagnesemia. Diuretics and some cytostatics, and antibiotics decrease Mg++ 
      in plasma, erythrocytes and muscles. Decreased Mg++ have been found in
      alcoholics, diabetics and Crohn disease, which are in certain cases related to
      existing heart rhythm disturbances. In cardiology it is proved that Mg++ are
      beneficial in AMI, protection during open heart surgery and treatment and
      prevention of heart surgery and heart rhythm disturbances. The use of Mg++ in
      vasospastic angina pectoris, Raynaud's disease and cardiomyopathies due to
      cytostatics is still in the process of investigation. It is still a matter of
      discussion whether Mg++ should be administered in these conditions or only when
      its quantities are reduced. Do Mg++ values in plasma indicate its total presence 
      in the organism? Where should Mg++ be administered as therapy, in which doses and
      how rapidly? Should preventive addition of Mg++ in drinking water reduce heart
      disease and prolong life? There are neither many answers nor real conclusions on 
      Mg++ significance in cardiology. However, some encouraging results about its use 
      indicate the significance of further investigations. DISCUSSION: It has been
      accepted by the authors all over the world that the role of magnesium is of great
      importance in prevention and treatment of cardiac patients. CONCLUSION: Our first
      experiences are in accordance with other studies.

TI  - Health information provided by retail health food outlets.
PG  - 767-71
AB  - Alternative health practices have become increasingly popular in recent years.
      Many patients visit specific complementary practitioners, while others attempt to
      educate themselves, trusting advice from employees at local health food stores or
      the Internet. Thirty-two retail health food stores were surveyed on the nature of
      the information provided by their staff. A research assistant visited the stores 
      and presented as the mother of a child in whom Crohn's disease had been
      diagnosed. Seventy-two per cent (23 of 32) of store employees offered advice,
      such as to take nutritional and herbal supplements. Of the 23 stores where
      recommendations were made, 15 (65%) based their recommendation on a source of
      information. Fourteen of the 15 stores using information sources used the same
      reference book. This had a significant impact on the recommendations; the use of 
      nutritional supplements was favoured. In conclusion, retail health food stores
      are not as inconsistent as hypothesized, although there are many variances in the
      types of supplements recommended for the same chronic disease.

TI  - Is lactobacillus GG helpful in children with Crohn's disease? Results of a
      preliminary, open-label study.
PG  - 453-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactobacillus GG is a safe probiotic bacterium known to transiently
      colonize the human intestine. It has been found to be useful in treatment of
      several gastrointestinal conditions characterized by increased gut permeability. 
      In the current study, the efficacy of Lactobacillus GG was investigated in
      children with Crohn's disease. METHODS: In this open-label pilot evaluation
      viewed as a necessary preliminary step for a possible subsequent randomized
      placebo-controlled trial, four children with mildly to moderately active Crohn's 
      disease were given Lactobacillus GG (10(10) colony-forming units [CFU]) in
      enterocoated tablets twice a day for 6 months. Changes in intestinal permeability
      were measured by a double sugar permeability test. Clinical activity was
      determined by measuring the pediatric Crohn's disease activity index. RESULTS:
      There was a significant improvement in clinical activity 1 week after starting
      Lactobacillus GG, which was sustained throughout the study period. Median
      pediatric Crohn's disease activity index scores at 4 weeks were 73% lower than
      baseline. Intestinal permeability improved in an almost parallel fashion.
      CONCLUSIONS: Findings in this pilot study show that Lactobacillus GG may improve 
      gut barrier function and clinical status in children with mildly to moderately
      active, stable Crohn's disease. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      trials are warranted for a final assessment of the efficacy of Lactobacillus GG
      in Crohn's disease.

TI  - Gastric outlet obstruction and pulmonary infiltrate in a patient with Crohn's
      disease: successful treatment by Billroth-II-resection.
PG  - 637-41
AB  - We present a 28-year-old women with a 3 yr history of duodenal ulcers. Following 
      four treatment attempts to eradicate helicobacter pylori she was admitted because
      of gastric outlet obstruction and a weight loss of 20 kg within the last two
      years. Endoscopy and x-ray showed a circular inflammatory stenosis of the
      proximal duodenum extending over 8 cm. Additionally, chest x-ray showed a
      circumscript infiltrate in the third segment of the right lung. Mycobacterial
      infection could be excluded. Ileocolonoscopy and small intestinal follow-through 
      beyond the duodenum were unremarkable, and Zollinger-Ellison-syndrome was ruled
      out. Bronchopulmonary histology showed intramucosal epithelioid-cell granulomas
      and bronchiolitis obliterans. Because the patient did not improve under
      conservative therapy a Billroth-II-resection was carried out. Histologically the 
      resected specimen showed Crohn-like lesions. Postoperatively, severe peripheral
      arthritis was treated by steroids over 6 weeks. At follow-up the patient regained
      20 kg and was free of symptoms without any medication. The pulmonary infiltrate
      had subsided almost completely. In summary, this extremely rare coincidence of
      isolated stenosing duodenal Crohn's disease and pulmonary involvement was
      successfully treated by Billroth-II-resection. This course of disease is
      compatible with the hypothesis that Crohn's disease may be maintained by antigens
      derived from ingested food.

TI  - Identification of cell wall deficient forms of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis
      in paraffin embedded tissues from animals with Johne's disease by in situ
      hybridization.
PG  - 185-95
AB  - M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis (M. paratuberculosis) is the causative agent of 
      Johne's disease (JD) in ruminants leading to enormous economical losses in dairy 
      and meat industries worldwide. During the subclinical stage of the disease, the
      infected animals are difficult if not impossible to detect by the available
      diagnostic tests including the PCR based ones. Although only considered an animal
      pathogen, cell wall deficient (CWD) forms of M. paratuberculosis have been
      isolated from patients with sarcoidosis and Crohn's disease (idiopathic diseases)
      in humans. Hence, the CWD form of this organism has been suspected to play a role
      in the pathogenesis of these diseases by persisting in the affected tissues and
      triggering a localized immune response and pathology. Differentiating between the
      CWD and acid-fast forms of this organism may lead to the determination of whether
      the CWD form is the pathogenic form in the subclinical cases of JD in animals
      and/or the etiologic agent for the above human diseases. To localize such
      organisms in tissue sections, CWD forms of mycobacteria were prepared in vitro
      and injected into beef cubes which were then formalin fixed and paraffin
      embedded. An in situ hybridization (ISH) technique, combined with the IS900 M.
      paratuberculosis-specific probe labeled with digoxigenin, was developed for the
      detection of nucleic acids specifically from the CWD forms but not their
      acid-fast forms in tissue sections. Specificity was confirmed by the negative
      finding with an irrelevant probe and with control tissue preparations containing 
      CWD cells of related mycobacteria and unrelated organisms. This ISH procedure
      provides a way to distinguish between the acid-fast and CWD forms of M.
      paratuberculosis and to localize them in tissue sections. ISH may prove useful to
      evaluate the significance of CWD forms of M. paratuberculosis in the pathogenesis
      of JD, Crohn's disease and sarcoidosis.

TI  - Clinical pharmacokinetics of slow release mesalazine.
PG  - 85-97
AB  - Slow release oral mesalazine (Pentasa) contains microgranules covered by a
      semipermeable ethylcellulose membrane. The microgranules continuously release
      their content from duodenum to ileum in a pH- and time-dependent way. About 75%
      of the microgranules pass into the colon, where further release is slower. This
      release pattern does not appear to be affected by food, diarrhoea or the
      simultaneous use of H2 antagonists. Rectal forms of mesalazine deliver active
      drug directly to the rectum and left colon. Plasma concentrations of mesalazine
      and its metabolite acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid after oral or local
      administration are the result of systemic absorption and hepatic metabolism by
      N-acetyltransferase. Most studies report maximal plasma concentrations of less
      than 1 mg/L after oral administration of slow release mesalazine, much lower than
      those observed after uncoated mesalazine but generally higher than after
      azo-bound drugs such as sulfasalazine. Urinary recovery is an indicator of
      absorption and metabolism, and is lower after rectal administration (10 to 30%)
      than after oral administration (30 to 40%). Faecal recovery after oral
      administration of slow or delayed release mesalazine is lower than with azo-bound
      drugs. Mesalazine acts locally after absorption by colonic and ileal mucosa. Mean
      steady-state concentrations of 25.7+/-2.2 microg/kg wet weight are found in
      ileocolonic biopsy specimens from patients with irritable bowel syndrome treated 
      for 1 week with slow release mesalazine 1.5 g/day. Intramucosal concentrations
      after slow release mesalazine differ little between healthy individuals and
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Although significant differences are
      found between the various aminosalicylates in release patterns and the resulting 
      pharmacokinetic parameters, no differences in therapeutic effects have been found
      in comparative studies. High doses of oral mesalazine (2 to 4 g/day) are more
      effective than lower doses in the treatment of patients with mild to moderate
      active ulcerative colitis. High doses (4 g/day) are also effective in the
      treatment of Crohn's disease, predominantly in patients with ileitis. In
      contrast, no dose ranging effects were demonstrated with local treatment forms:
      mesalazine 1g enema seems sufficient for patients with distal colitis. Higher
      serum concentrations and urinary recoveries after the administration of slow or
      delayed release mesalazine compared with azo-bound drugs suggest a higher risk
      for renal adverse effects, although the reported occurrence is extremely low.
      Although preliminary data support an association between mucosal concentrations
      of mesalazine and its clinical activity, further studies are needed to correlate 
      the effects of this drug with its pharmacokinetic parameters.

      Crohn's disease has been evaluated. Thirty-two patients with Crohn's disease in
      clinical remission (CDAI < 150) were randomly treated for six months with either 
      mesalamine 1 g three times a day or mesalamine 1 g two times a day plus a
      preparation of Saccharomyces boulardii 1 g daily. Clinical relapses as assessed
      by CDAI values were observed in 37.5% of patients receiving mesalamine alone and 
      in 6.25% of patients in the group treated with mesalamine plus the probiotic
      agent. Our results suggest that Saccharomyces boulardii may represent a useful
      tool in the maintenance treatment of Crohn's disease. However, in view of the
      product's cost, further controlled studies are needed to confirm these
      preliminary data.

      wall....].
PG  - 48-51
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are clinical entities
      characterized by spontaneous relapses and are thought to be caused in large part 
      by a dysregulated immune response to inflammatory stimuli. Specific infectious
      agents or antigens inducing or perpetuating inflammation, however, are not known.
      Recent results in contrast support the hypothesis, that the normal intestinal
      flora plays a central role in the pathogenesis of both diseases. Studies
      performed with E. coli Nissle 1917 demonstrated that this bacterium can
      positively affect the course of disease in UC and CD patients. The clinical
      efficacy of probiotics can yield valuable information about disease pathogenesis 
      and, as a modification of current standard therapy, opens new and interesting
      therapeutic alternatives.

TI  - Therapy of Crohn's disease in childhood.
PG  - 193-203
AB  - Crohn's disease in childhood is a chronic relapsing condition with a high
      morbidity. Growth failure is common. The aim of therapy is to induce and then
      maintain disease remission and thereby promote well-being and normal growth and
      development. Enteral nutrition (either polymeric or elemental) is effective and
      used as initial therapy. This is employed as sole therapy over a 6- to 8-week
      period followed by a period of controlled food reintroduction. The relapse rate
      is high and further courses of enteral nutrition or alternative therapies are
      frequently required. Corticosteroids are also effective as initial therapy and
      are required in difficult cases but there are problems with their long term use, 
      particularly their adverse effects on growth. Many patients develop either
      corticosteroid-dependent or corticosteroid-resistant disease. In this instance,
      additional immunosuppression, such as azathioprine, can be used. Surgery is
      required for those patients with disease resistant to medical therapy and this
      will result in remission; however, the relapse rate with surgery is high. There
      are many areas for future research. Very little is known about why enteral
      nutrition works, how long it should be given or its role as maintenance therapy. 
      Newer immunosuppressive strategies based on cytokine modulation may be helpful in
      children once more experience is gained from their use in adults.

TI  - Johne's disease and milk: do consumers need to worry?
PG  - 1659-63
AB  - Mycobacterium paratuberculosis, an acid-fast bacillus that causes enteritis in
      ruminants, has been suggested as an etiological agent of Crohn's disease in
      humans. The mode of transmission is unclear; however, some evidence suggests that
      humans may become infected via contaminated milk. Currently, it is not known
      whether commercial pasteurization effectively kills M. paratuberculosis in
      contaminated raw milk. Using a laboratory-scale pasteurizer unit designed to
      simulate the high-temperature, short-time method (72 degrees C, 15 sec) currently
      used by commercial dairies, we previously demonstrated that treatment of raw milk
      inoculated with 10(4) to 10(6) cfu of M. paratuberculosis/ml reduced numbers to
      an undetectable level. However, M. paratuberculosis is an intracellular pathogen 
      that resides within the macrophages of the host and evades destruction. We
      subsequently performed further experiments examining heat treatment of milk
      inoculated with mammary gland macrophages containing ingested M.
      paratuberculosis. Heat treatment of these samples under high-temperature,
      short-time conditions demonstrated that the macrophage does not protect the
      organism because we were unable to recover any viable M. paratuberculosis from
      the samples. Conversely, other researchers have demonstrated that a residual
      population of M. paratuberculosis may survive heat treatment of milk. In
      addition, a recent news report stated that viable M. paratuberculosis organisms
      have been cultured from retail-ready milk in Ireland. A summary of past and
      current studies concerning this issue along with a discussion of methodologies
      used to recover M. paratuberculosis from experimentally inoculated milk will be
      presented in this paper.

TI  - Comprehensive nutritional status in recently diagnosed patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease compared with population controls.
PG  - 514-21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Malnutrition is observed frequently in patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD). Knowledge of the nutritional status in patients with
      recently diagnosed IBD is limited. The aim of this study was to establish a
      comprehensive picture of the nutritional status in recently diagnosed IBD
      patients. SUBJECTS: Sixty-nine IBD patients (23 Crohn's disease (CD) and 46 with 
      ulcerative colitis (UC)) within 6 months of diagnosis and 69 age- and sex-matched
      population controls were included in the study. METHODS: The nutritional status
      was assessed by: (1) body composition (anthropometry and dual-energy X-ray
      absorptiometry); (2) dietary intake (dietary history); (3) biochemical indexes of
      nutrition; and (4) muscle strength (isokinetic dynamometer). RESULTS: Body weight
      and body mass index were significantly lower in UC patients compared with
      controls. The mean daily intake of carbohydrates was significantly higher in CD
      patients and the intakes of protein, calcium, phosphorus, and riboflavin were
      significantly lower in UC patients compared with controls, respectively. Serum
      concentrations of several nutrients (beta-carotene, magnesium, selenium and zinc)
      were significantly lower in UC patients compared with controls. Serum vitamin B12
      concentration was significantly lower in CD patients. Muscle strength did not
      significantly differ between IBD patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study
      showed that the nutritional status of IBD patients was already affected
      negatively at time of diagnosis. It needs to be elucidated whether nutritional
      supplementation in recently diagnosed IBD patients may improve the clinical
      course of the disease.

TI  - A preliminary study of growth hormone therapy for Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1633-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel. In a
      preliminary study, we evaluated whether the administration of growth hormone
      (somatropin) as well as a high-protein diet would ameliorate the symptoms of the 
      disease. METHODS: We randomly assigned 37 adults with moderate-to-severe active
      Crohn's disease to four months of self-administered injections of growth hormone 
      (loading dose, 5 mg per day subcutaneously for one week, followed by a
      maintenance dose of 1.5 mg per day) or placebo. We instructed all patients to
      increase their protein intake to at least 2 g per kilogram of body weight per
      day. Patients continued to be treated by their usual physicians and to receive
      other medications for Crohn's disease. The primary end point was the change in
      scores on the Crohn's Disease Activity Index from base line to month 4. Scores
      can range from 0 to 600, with higher scores indicating more disease activity.
      RESULTS: At base line, the mean (+/-SD) score on the Crohn's Disease Activity
      Index was somewhat higher among the 19 patients in the growth hormone group than 
      among the 18 patients in the placebo group (287+/-134 vs. 213+/-120, P=0.09).
      Three patients in the placebo group withdrew before their first follow-up visit
      and were not included in the data analysis. At four months, the Crohn's Disease
      Activity Index score had decreased by a mean of 143+/-144 points in the growth
      hormone group, as compared with a decrease of 19+/-63 points in the placebo group
      (P=0.004). Side effects in the growth hormone group included edema (in 10
      patients) and headache (in 5) and usually resolved within the first month of
      treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary study suggests that growth hormone may be
      a beneficial treatment for patients with Crohn's disease.

TI  - Probiotics and inflammatory bowel disease: is there a scientific rationale?
PG  - 107-15
AB  - Most conventional forms of drug therapy suppress or modify the host
      immunoinflammatory response and neglect the other contributor to disease
      pathogenesis-the environmental microflora. Probiotics are live microbial food
      ingredients that alter the enteric microflora and have a beneficial effect on
      health. The rationale for using probiotics in IBD is mainly based on evidence
      from human studies and experimental animal models implicating intestinal bacteria
      in the pathogenesis of these disorders. The relationship between bacteria and
      intestinal inflammation is complex and does not appear to reflect a simple cause 
      and effect. Similarly, the field of probiotics is complex and in need of rigorous
      research. Until the indigenous flora are better characterized and mechanisms of
      probiotic action defined, the promise of probiotics in IBD is unlikely to be
      fulfilled. Because of strain-specific variability and clinical and therapeutic
      heterogeneity within Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, it cannot be assumed
      that a given probiotic is equally suitable for all individuals. Although
      preliminary results of probiotic therapy in animal models and humans with
      ulcerative colitis and pouchitis have been encouraging, their efficacy in
      treatment or maintenance of remission of Crohn's disease remains to be clarified.
      However, the circumstantial evidence for some form of biotherapeutic modification
      of the enteric flora in Crohn's disease seems compelling. In the future,
      probiotics may offer a simple adjunct to conventional therapy with the emphasis
      on diet shifting from one of nutritional replenishment alone to a more functional
      role.

TI  - Effects of elemental diet (ED) on surgical treatment in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 390-2
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Patients with Crohn's disease are at risk of developing short
      bowel syndrome if they are treated with repeated operations. We examined the
      effect of preoperative nutritional therapy with elemental diet on the interval
      until and the outcome after surgical treatment in patients with Crohn's disease. 
      METHODOLOGY: We reviewed the records for 73 patients with Crohn's disease who
      underwent intestinal resection in our department between January 1, 1974 and
      December 31, 1996. Thirty-two of them had not received elemental diet (No ED
      group) and 41 had received elemental diet therapy (ED group) before the first
      resection. RESULTS: The median interval between the onset and first resection was
      19.3 months for the NoED group and 67.5 months for the ED group (P = 0.0005). All
      patients received ED therapy after the first resection. The incidence of second
      resection was significantly different between the ED and the NoED group after the
      first operation. (P = 0.045). CONCLUSIONS: Elemental diet therapy is effective in
      prolonging the interval between the onset and first resection and in reducing the
      incidence of second resection. The initial introduction of elemental diet therapy
      is useful in the management of the clinical course of Crohn's disease minimizing 
      surgical intervention.

TI  - 99Tcm-HMPAO leucocyte labelling in orofacial granulomatosis and gastrointestinal 
      Crohn's disease in childhood and early adulthood.
PG  - 155-8
AB  - Orofacial granulomatosis is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder, affecting the 
      soft tissues of the face and mouth. The predominant feature is disfiguring lip
      swelling. Patients with this condition may be exhibiting a Type IV
      hypersensitivity reaction to dietary or environmental allergens, or these may be 
      the orofacial manifestations of underlying gastrointestinal Crohn's disease. The 
      results of 99Tcm-HMPAO leucocyte labelling of the gastrointestinal tract in 14
      patients with orofacial granulomatosis and 15 patients with known
      gastrointestinal Crohn's disease are presented, indicating that this is a useful 
      and non-invasive screening test for the identification of gastrointestinal
      Crohn's disease in paediatric and young adult patients presenting with orofacial 
      granulomatosis.

TI  - Antibacterial therapy for Crohn's disease: a review emphasizing therapy directed 
      against mycobacteria.
PG  - 445-56
AB  - The most commonly used antibiotics in Crohn's disease are nitroimidazoles and
      macrolides often combined with corticosteroids or sulfasalazine. There has been
      interest in a mycobacterial involvement in Crohn's disease since its earliest
      description. It is not recognized that Mycobacterium avium subspecies
      paratuberculosis, a proven but uncommon cause of human disease, is widespread in 
      the human food chain especially in dairy products and beef. M. paratuberculosis
      has been identified in tissues from a higher proportion of Crohn's disease
      patients than controls, suggesting that it may be one of the causes of Crohn's
      disease. We review the large number of antibiotic trials in Crohn's disease.
      Although studies have been performed with many different protocols and variations
      in the definition of success, preliminary reports of multiple drug therapies are 
      encouraging. Nevertheless, large-well designed preferably placebo-controlled
      studies are needed before one could recommend such therapy.

TI  - Mucosal healing and a fall in mucosal pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA induced by a
      specific oral polymeric diet in paediatric Crohn's disease.
PG  - 281-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although enteral nutrition is a recognized form of treatment for
      intestinal Crohn's disease, there are persisting problems with feed palatability 
      and only limited data as to its mode of action. AIM: To assess the effects of a
      specific oral polymeric diet (CT3211; Nestle, Vevey, Switzerland), which is rich 
      in transforming growth factor beta2, on the mucosal inflammatory process.
      METHODS: Twenty-nine consecutive children with active intestinal Crohn's disease 
      were treated with CT3211 as the sole source of nutrition for 8 weeks. Patients
      were assessed clinically, and endoscopically, whilst cytokine mRNA was measured
      in mucosal biopsies before and after treatment by quantitative reverse
      transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: After 8 weeks 79% of children
      were in complete clinical remission. Macroscopic and histological healing in the 
      terminal ileum and colon was associated with a decline in ileal and colonic
      interleukin-1beta mRNA (pre-treatment to post-treatment ratio 0.008 and 0.06: P <
      0.001, P = 0.006). In the ileum there was also a fall in interferon gamma mRNA
      (ratio 0.15, P < 0.001) with a rise in transforming growth factor beta1 mRNA
      (ratio 10, P = 0.04), whilst in the colon interleukin-8 mRNA fell with treatment 
      (ratio 0.06, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical response to oral polymeric diet
      CT3211 is associated with mucosal healing and a down regulation of mucosal
      pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA in both the terminal ileum and colon. In the ileum
      there was also an increase in transforming growth factor beta1 mRNA.

TI  - Polymeric versus elemental diet as primary treatment in active Crohn's disease: a
      randomized, double-blind trial.
PG  - 735-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Enteral feeding is now an established primary therapy for active
      Crohn's disease. This first-double blind randomized trial was designed to compare
      the therapeutic efficacy of a polymeric diet (PD) with an elemental diet (ED).
      METHODS: Patients with active Crohn's disease (Crohn's disease activity index
      [CDAI] > 150, increased bowel uptake of Tc-HMPAO-labeled leukocytes, and abnormal
      C-reactive protein [CRP]), were randomized to receive either an ED or a PD. The
      two preparations were identical except for the nitrogen source, which was amino
      acid based in ED and intact protein in PD. Enteral feeding was considered
      successful if clinical remission was achieved as defined by a final CDAI of < or 
      = 150, a reduction in the CDAI by at least 100 points from baseline level, and a 
      normal CRP. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were enrolled of whom 11 were randomized
      to PD and 10 to ED. The two groups were comparable at entry. Clinical remission
      was obtained in eight (80%) patients receiving ED and six (55%) patients
      receiving PD, p = 0.1. The treatment failed in three and two patients in the PD
      and ED groups, respectively. Another two patients were intolerant to the feed
      (PD). Reduction in the CDAI after treatment with ED (359 +/- 67 to 112 +/- 19)
      was similar to that seen with PD (303 +/- 27 to 97 +/- 11). Similar changes in
      the CRP were also observed (16 +/- 5 to 4 +/- 1.6) and (62 +/- 20 to 9 +/- 6),
      respectively. Overall, enteral feeding was successful in 14 patients (63%).
      CONCLUSIONS: Enteral nutrition is effective in treatment of active Crohn's
      disease. Differences in nitrogen sources of enteral feeds are not relevant to
      their therapeutic efficacy, as polymeric and elemental diets are equally
      effective.

TI  - Energy metabolism and substrate oxidation in patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 173-8
AB  - Weight loss and malnutrition are common features in patients with Crohn's
      disease. This study was designed to evaluate diet-induced thermogenesis and
      substrate oxidation in patients with Crohn's disease. Twenty-three patients (17
      women, 6 men; age 34 +/- 2 y) and 17 healthy control subjects (13 women, 4 men;
      age 36 +/- 3 y) were studied. Resting energy expenditure and fasting substrate
      oxidation were measured by indirect calorimetry in the morning after an overnight
      fast. After a standard homogenized test meal (10 kcal/kg), indirect calorimetry
      was performed every 30 min for 3 h to measure the diet-induced thermogenesis and 
      the postprandial substrate oxidation. In the fasting state, resting energy
      expenditure was significantly higher in patients than in control subjects (1433
      +/- 43 versus 1279 +/- 53 kcal/24 h). Lipid oxidation was higher in patients with
      Crohn's disease than in control subjects (1.17 +/- 0. 07 versus 0.61 +/- 0.11 mg.
      kg(-1). min(-1), P < 0.01). Postprandially, diet-induced thermogenesis was
      significantly lower in patients with Crohn's disease than in control subjects
      (4.6% +/- 0.5 versus 6.3% +/- 0.5 of energy intake, P < 0.01). Lipid oxidation
      was significantly higher in patients with Crohn's disease than in control
      subjects (0.78 +/- 0.05 versus 0.56 +/- 0.08 mg. kg(-1). min(-1), P < 0.05), and 
      glucose oxidation was lower in patients with Crohn's disease than in control
      subjects. In patients with Crohn's disease, lipid oxidation positively correlates
      with the disease activity evaluated by the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (r =
      0.48, P150), fasting and postprandial lipid oxidation was significantly higher
      than in patients with inactive Crohn's disease (P < 0.05). In conclusion,
      patients with Crohn's disease have increased fat oxidation, which correlates with
      disease activity and this may explain the reduced fat stores in patients with
      Crohn's disease.

AB  - Recent advances in the therapy of inflammatory bowel disease specifically
      directed against the inflammatory and immune mechanisms include an impressive and
      often overwhelming cornucopia of anti-inflammatory agents, immunomodulators,
      antibiotics, biologicals, topical therapies, nicotine, heparin, and nutritional
      supplements. The interface of one drug regimen into another may lead to
      confounding and often confusing programs of treatment. This review will attempt
      to offer a perspective of care and an update of specific remedies, but the aim is
      practicality and usefulness, not encyclopedic detail.

TI  - Treatment of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 90-100
AB  - The treatment of Crohn's disease depends on disease location and disease
      activity. It can be divided into medical and surgical treatment. While surgery is
      reserved for complications such as abscesses or failure of pharmacological
      treatment (fistulae, perianal disease, or strictures) medical treatment aims at
      induction and maintenance of remission. In order to achieve these goals
      supportive and therapeutic strategies must be used. Supportive measures include
      substitution of vitamins, particularly fat-soluble vitamins, and minerals in
      deficiencies due to resection or disease involvement of the small bowel. All
      patients on long-term steroids should receive calcium and vitamin D in order to
      prevent osteoporosis. Therapeutic options include drug treatment
      (corticosteroids, antibiotics, salicylates, and immunosuppressives), nutrition
      (parenteral or enteral), and endoscopy (dilatation of strictures). Depending on
      disease location different pharmacologic preparations of salicylates or
      corticosteroids should be used, e.g., enemas for distal colitis. The most potent 
      drugs for long-term control are immunosuppressive agents, particularly
      azathioprine. It is the most widely investigated immunosuppressive agent in
      Crohn's disease and should be the first line treatment for patients with steroid 
      refractory, chronic steroid dependent, fistulating, and stenosing courses. In the
      future, more potent drugs and better risk stratification criteria should improve 
      the treatment of Crohn's disease.

TI  - Effect of a vegetable-protein-rich polymeric diet treatment on body composition
      and energy metabolism in inactive Crohn's disease.
PG  - 5-11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Since malnutrition and lactose intolerance are frequently reported in 
      Crohn's disease (CD), we evaluated the differences in terms of
      compliance-to-treatment and nutritional status in inactive CD patients after two 
      different treatments using either a standard polymeric diet or a
      vegetable-protein-rich and lactose-free diet. STUDY DESIGN: A case-control study.
      SUBJECTS: Forty CD patients with inactive disease were randomly divided into two 
      groups. Group A (10 men; aged 33.9+/-7.2 years; BMI, 21.8+/-1.7 kg/m2) received a
      conventional polymeric enteral diet, while group B (10 men; aged 35.6+/-6.8
      years; BMI, 21.4+/-1.8 kg/m2) was administered a soy-rich and lactose-free
      polymeric diet, over a 4-week period. METHODS: All the patients had a clinical
      and laboratory examination. Body composition was assessed by isotopic dilution
      and resting metabolic rate (RMR), and substrate oxidation rates were measured by 
      indirect calorimetry. RESULTS: Body weight significantly increased after
      treatment in both groups (A, P<0.05; and B, P<0.01), as well as fat-free mass (A,
      P<0.05; and B, P<0.05) and fat mass (A, P<0.05; and B, P<0.01). RMR slightly
      increased, although it did not reach statistical significance. Treatment did not 
      influence substrate oxidation rates. Group B lactose-intolerant patients reported
      a greater compliance-to-treatment than those in group A. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      showed that a polymeric enteral diet rich in vegetable protein and not containing
      milk protein, eaten at home, with no need for positioning a nasogastric tube,
      significantly improved body composition in inactive and lactose-intolerant CD
      patients, with no effect on energy metabolism, suggesting that it could be useful
      in improving nutritional status in these patients.

TI  - Bioactive molecules in milk and their role in health and disease: the role of
      transforming growth factor-beta.
PG  - 74-9
AB  - Human breast milk is rich in nutrients, hormones, growth factors and immunoactive
      molecules, which influence the growth, development and immune status of the
      newborn infant. Although several of these factors are also present in bovine
      milk, the greater susceptibility of the formula-fed infant to infection and
      disease and the development of allergy is often attributed to the reduced level
      of protective factors in milk formulas. Nevertheless, modifying manufacturing
      processes may preserve the biological activity of some bioactive molecules in end
      products. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta is one such molecule. TGF-beta is
      a polypeptide, which has been described in both human and bovine milk. It is
      implicated in many processes, including epithelial cell growth and
      differentiation, development, carcinogenesis and immune regulation. The present
      article discusses the biological activity of TGF-beta2 that has been preserved
      and activated in a cow's milk-based product. More specifically, it addresses
      possible mechanisms of action in the intestinal lumen and speculates on how milk 
      products containing naturally occurring TGF-beta2 could be exploited in
      functional foods for the infant or as therapies for specific intestinal diseases.

      disease and ulcerative colitis].
PG  - 31-3
AB  - Ovalbumin loading enzyme immunoassay was made in 44 patients with ulcerative
      colitis (UC) and 8 patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Enhanced intestinal
      permeability for macromolecules was found in 87.5 and 65.9% of patients with CD
      and UC, respectively. Blood serum of UC patients suffering from combination of
      food intolerance with dysbacteriosis contained ovalbumin in amounts exceeding
      those in patients without the above disorders 3.4 times (p < 0.05). No
      significant relationship existed between UC patients' high intestinal
      permeability and such indices as age, duration of the disease, intestinal lesion 
      extension, administration of corticosteroids. It was found desirable to include
      ovalbumin intestinal permeability test in examination of UC and CD patients to
      differentiate treatment policy.

TI  - Double-blind randomized controlled trial of glutamine-enriched polymeric diet in 
      the treatment of active Crohn's disease.
PG  - 78-84
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glutamine is traditionally considered a nonessential amino acid but
      may be conditionally essential in patients with catabolic conditions.
      Glutamine-supplemented foods in these patients have been shown to prevent
      deterioration of gut permeability, protect against the development of intestinal 
      mucosal atrophy, and improve nitrogen balance. Animal models of inflammatory
      bowel disease suggest that glutamine-enriched enteral diets may lead to less
      severe intestinal damage, less weight loss, improved nitrogen balance, and
      reduced disease activity. The purpose of the current study was to compare the
      efficacy of a glutamine-enriched polymeric diet with a standard low-glutamine
      polymeric diet in the treatment of active Crohn's disease. METHODS: Eighteen
      children with active Crohn's disease were randomly assigned to receive a 4-week
      course of either a standard polymeric diet with a low glutamine content (4% of
      amino acid composition; group S) or a glutamine-enriched polymeric diet (42% of
      amino acid composition; Group G). The two diets were isocaloric and
      isonitrogenous with an identical essential amino acid profile. Remission rates
      were analysed on an intent-to-treat basis. Changes in clinical and laboratory
      parameters of disease activity were also compared after 4 weeks of nutritional
      treatment. RESULTS: Two of the children, both in group G, were withdrawn from the
      trial because of nontolerance of the diet. There was no difference between the
      two groups in proportion of patients achieving remission (intent-to-treat basis):
      5 (55.5%) of 9 in group S versus 4 (44.4%) of 9 in group G (p = 0.5). Improvement
      in mean paediatric Crohn's disease activity index (PCDAI) was significantly more 
      in group S (p = 0.002) but changes in orosomucoid level, platelet count, and
      weight were not different between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest
      that a glutamine-enriched polymeric diet offers no advantage over a standard
      low-glutamine polymeric diet in the treatment of active Crohn's disease. Rather, 
      it appears to be less effective in improving PCDAI. The reported beneficial
      effects of glutamine seen in many catabolic states must be viewed with caution
      when extrapolating to the management of Crohn's disease.

TI  - Polyunsaturated fatty acids and inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 339S-42S
LID - 10.1093/ajcn/71.1.339s [doi]
AB  - The rationale for supplementation with n-3 fatty acids to promote the health of
      the gastrointestinal tract lies in the antiinflammatory effects of these lipid
      compounds. The first evidence of the importance of dietary intake of n-3
      polyunsaturated fatty acids was derived from epidemiologic observations of the
      low incidence of inflammatory bowel disease in Eskimos. The aim of this paper was
      to briefly review the literature on the use of n-3 fatty acids in inflammatory
      bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease), the results of which are
      controversial. The discrepancies between studies may reside in the different
      study designs used as well as in the various formulations and dosages used, some 
      of which may lead to a high incidence of side effects. Choosing a formulation
      that lowers the incidence of side effects, selecting patients carefully, and
      paying strict attention to experimental design are critical when investigating
      further the therapeutic potential of these lipids in inflammatory bowel disease.

PG  - 71S-80S
AB  - Energy-protein malnutrition and the sub-clinical deficiencies of vitamins and
      trace elements, are frequent findings in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, 
      and these may negatively influence the clinical course of these diseases. In
      general, the majority of the patients with ulcerative colitis and uncomplicated
      Crohn's disease can ingest a normal diet that is well balanced and without any
      restrictions. The intolerance to specific foods is rare in Crohn's disease and
      the application of exclusion diets in a routine manner is not indicated. When the
      nutritional status cannot be adequately maintained with normal ingestion, the use
      of artificial nutrition is indicated. Enteral nutrition is the first choice
      nutritional support system if the gastrointestinal tract is accessible and at
      least partially functional. In Crohn's disease enteral nutrition could have a
      specific anti-inflammatory effect ("primary treatment"), and it has been
      suggested that this could be effective to induce the clinical remission of the
      activity bouts of the disease. Some types of dietary fiber could be effective in 
      the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Initial studies suggest their usefulness in 
      maintaining the remission of the disease.

PG  - 560S-569S
LID - 10.1093/ajcn/70.3.560s [doi]
AB  - Human beings evolved consuming a diet that contained about equal amounts of n-3
      and n-6 essential fatty acids. Over the past 100-150 y there has been an enormous
      increase in the consumption of n-6 fatty acids due to the increased intake of
      vegetable oils from corn, sunflower seeds, safflower seeds, cottonseed, and
      soybeans. Today, in Western diets, the ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids ranges
      from approximately 20-30:1 instead of the traditional range of 1-2:1. Studies
      indicate that a high intake of n-6 fatty acids shifts the physiologic state to
      one that is prothrombotic and proaggregatory, characterized by increases in blood
      viscosity, vasospasm, and vasoconstriction and decreases in bleeding time. n-3
      Fatty acids, however, have antiinflammatory, antithrombotic, antiarrhythmic,
      hypolipidemic, and vasodilatory properties. These beneficial effects of n-3 fatty
      acids have been shown in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease,
      hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and, in some patients with renal disease,
      rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease, and chronic obstructive 
      pulmonary disease. Most of the studies were carried out with fish oils
      [eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)]. However,
      alpha-linolenic acid, found in green leafy vegetables, flaxseed, rapeseed, and
      walnuts, desaturates and elongates in the human body to EPA and DHA and by itself
      may have beneficial effects in health and in the control of chronic diseases.

PG  - 69-83
AB  - Anecdotally, people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) report that some foods 
      make them feel better and some foods make them feel worse. This paper reports
      about the relationship between food habits and reactions to foods in people with 
      IBD. A database was designed to incorporate the date of data collection, the IBD 
      disease, food habits, the quantity consumed and a response rating of the
      subjects' reactions to each food. For each of 122 foods, subjects were asked
      simultaneously about these five categories. Thirty three subjects with Crohn's
      disease and 27 with ulcerative colitis completed the questionnaire in two
      seasons. The focus of the examination was directed to the upper and lower limit
      of reactions to foods. Foods that affect people negatively and foods that affect 
      people positively were identified in relation to habits of consumption. Foods
      that affect people negatively were among those never consumed while foods that
      affect people positively were among the regularly consumed foods. Findings
      included an increased number of foods that caused problems for people with
      Crohn's disease when compared with people with ulcerative colitis. Problems with 
      chocolate, dairy products, fats and artificial sweeteners were documented in both
      groups of IBD. A standard food list generated without the input of individuals
      with a chronic illness may be inadequate to collect data about their consumption 
      since many of the foods on the list were reportedly never consumed and there may 
      be other foods not on the list that are consumed by this chronically ill
      population.

TI  - [Association of carcinoid tumor of the appendix and Crohn disease (case report
      and review of the literature)].
PG  - 1635-9
AB  - The authors describe the coexistence of the carcinoid of the appendix and Crohn's
      disease. In the case of their woman patient the carcinoid was identified with the
      examination of the resected ileoascendent part of the bowel resulting of the
      complication of the Crohn's disease. 10 similar association is known in the
      literature but none of the patients had the signs of the carcinoid syndrome.
      Subsequent adrenerg syndrome after an alimentary hypoglycemia (increased
      evacuation of the cathecolamines and their metabolites in the urine), food
      allergy (increased IgE type antibody to milk protein) or gastroenteropancreatic
      (GEP) neuroendocrine tumor (based on the result of the 111In-octreoscan and the
      increased 5-hydroxyindolaceticaciduria) equally suspected of the symptoms
      (palpitation, flush) manifested after the operation. They look for the connection
      between the genesis of the intestinal carcinoid and the Crohn's disease with
      working up the bibliography. Summing up the references with a view of the latest 
      it can be stated that the carcinoid of the appendix occurs more than orders of
      magnitude in the samples from inflamed surrounding than the samples from autopsy 
      (0.24%--820/338,000 inflamed appendix and 0.03%--19/53,430 appendix from
      autopsy). Consequently the inflammation create favourable condition for the
      development of the carcinoid of the appendix.

TI  - Anti-TNF antibody in Crohn's disease--status of information, comments and
      recommendations of an international working group.
PG  - 509-12
AB  - The chimeric anti-TNF antibody Remicade (Infliximab) has recently been approved
      for human use by the FDA and is now available on the market. Since there is
      considerable interest in this kind of treatment among patients with Crohn's
      disease, an international working group has summarized the presently available
      information about efficacy, side effects and possible problems of this treatment.
      Studies show that Remicade is effective in the treatment of active Crohn's
      disease, maintaining remission and fistulae. The working group does not see
      Infliximab as a first-line treatment for Crohn's disease. It may be used in
      active phase recurrent disease, chronic active disease and fistulae if standard
      treatment was not successful. For the surveillance special attention has to be
      given to the unknown malignancy rate of Infliximab. Infusion should be performed 
      in an institution, routinely performing intravenous infusions and a two-hour
      surveillance of the patients should be guaranteed to recognize anaphylactic
      reactions or acute side effects. There is presently no information indication
      that the combination with immunosuppressants might increase risks or side effects
      of this treatment. Due to the limited information available the working group
      would prefer to use Remicade in studies only and recommends central collection
      and documentation of all data on efficacy and side effects for the next year.

TI  - Human intestinal mast cells produce IL-5 in vitro upon IgE receptor cross-linking
      and in vivo in the course of intestinal inflammatory disease.
PG  - 1496-503
AB  - IL-5, known to be produced by T lymphocytes and eosinophils, is a key regulator
      of intestinal diseases such as parasitosis or eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Here 
      we examined if mast cells contribute to the IL-5 production in human intestinal
      mucosa. The number of IL-5-positive lamina propria cells was substantially higher
      in patients with intestinal inflammatory diseases (5.3 +/- 4.6%, n = 17) compared
      to healthy controls (0.5 +/- 0.9%, n = 8, p < 0.01). In patients, the
      IL-5-positive cells were eosinophils (70 +/- 13%) and mast cells (29 +/- 14%),
      whereas in controls all IL-5-positive cells were eosinophils. IL-5-positive T
      cells were not detected, likely because they do not store IL-5. In vitro studies 
      with isolated human intestinal mast cells and eosinophils showed that mast cells 
      do not produce IL-5 constitutively, but release high amounts of IL-5 (315 +/- 115
      pg/10(6) cells) following IgE receptor cross-linking, compared to activated
      eosinophils (24 +/- 5 pg/10(6) cells). Inhibitor studies suggest a regulation of 
      IL-5 production at the transcriptional level. In conclusion our data demonstrate 
      that activated mast cells are a potent source of IL-5 in the human intestinal
      mucosa.

TI  - Antitumor necrosis factor therapy for inflammatory bowel disease: a review of
      agents, pharmacology, clinical results, and safety.
PG  - 119-33
AB  - Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), a proinflammatory cytokine, plays an
      important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
      Biotechnology agents including a chimeric monoclonal anti-TNF antibody
      (infliximab), a humanized monoclonal anti-TNF antibody (CDP571), and a
      recombinant TNF receptor fusion protein (etanercept) have been used to inhibit
      TNFalpha activity. Controlled trials have demonstrated efficacy for infliximab in
      moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (CD) and fistulizing CD sufficient 
      to justify recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Additional
      trials have been completed in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Similarly, preliminary
      controlled trials have suggested efficacy for CDP571 in active CD and RA. Larger 
      controlled trials have demonstrated efficacy for etanercept in RA patients who
      have failed disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy leading to FDA
      approval for RA. Toxicities observed with anti-TNF therapies have included
      formation of human antichimeric antibodies (HACA) with associated acute and
      delayed hypersensitivity infusion reactions, human antihuman antibodies (HAHAs), 
      and formation of autoantibodies with rare instances of drug-induced lupus.
      Several cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma also has been described. Future studies
      should evaluate optimal timing and duration of anti-TNF therapy, the utility of
      adjuvant medical treatments during anti-TNF therapy, and evaluate long-term
      safety and efficacy of the various anti-TNF agents.

TI  - Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in Japanese patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease: prevalence and recognition of putative antigens.
PG  - 1304-12
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to investigate the prevalence of antineutrophil
      cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) in Japanese patients with ulcerative colitis (UC)
      and Crohn's disease (CD), and the putative antigens recognized by perinuclear
      staining pattern ANCA (p-ANCA)-positive sera. METHODS: Sera from UC (n = 52) and 
      CD (n = 43) patients, and from healthy controls (n = 74) were studied. The
      indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) method was used for the detection of ANCA and
      its binding pattern. p-ANCA-positive sera were studied further for putative
      antigens. ELISAs using lactoferrin (Lf), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and cathepsin G
      (Cat G) as antigens were performed. RESULTS: ANCA was positive in 40 of the 52
      (76.9%) UC (p-ANCA in 33) and in 32 of the 43 (74.4%) CD (p-ANCA in 31) patients.
      UC and CD patients showed significantly higher titers of p-ANCA than controls;
      however, no significant difference was observed between UC and CD. In UC, 23, 17,
      and nine of the 33 patients with p-ANCA-positive sera showed reactivity with Lf, 
      MPO, and Cat-G, respectively. In CD, 21, 20, and 11 of the 31 patients with
      p-ANCA-positive sera showed reactivity with Lf, MPO, and Cat-G, respectively.
      Fourteen of the UC and six of the CD patients showed reactivity with two
      different antigens, and seven of the UC and 11 of the CD patients showed
      reactivity with all three antigens. The presence of anti-Lf and anti-MPO
      antibodies was further confirmed by Western blotting. CONCLUSIONS: ANCA is useful
      in distinguishing patients with IBD from normal subjects but is not sufficient
      for the differential diagnosis of CD and UC. p-ANCA reactivity might be derived
      from the recognition of heterogeneous neutrophil-associated antigens.

TI  - Quality of life in children with Crohn's disease: a pilot study.
PG  - S37-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Focus group meetings were held with two groups, each containing 12
      children with Crohn's disease aged 8 to 12 and 12 to 17 years. The children were 
      asked broad questions about how Crohn's disease and its treatment affected their 
      lives. To explore these areas in more detail, an 88-item questionnaire was
      developed and read to an additional 16 of 20 children with Crohn's disease
      selected at random from outpatients. At first, many of the children denied that
      Crohn's disease affected their lives at all, but it soon became apparent that
      many were frustrated or angry about physical symptoms, lack of understanding
      about Crohn's disease, unpleasant investigations, treatment, and hospitalisation.
      METHODS: The questionnaire covered six domains of health-related quality of life 
      including symptoms and treatment, social, emotional, family, educational, and
      future aspects. RESULTS: Elemental diet was the preferred treatment, although
      surgery was more effective in controlling symptoms. Children receiving steroids
      had more depressive symptoms. Absenteeism from school and inability to engage in 
      school sports, swimming, and running were frequent problems. There were also
      difficulties with taking holidays and staying at friends' houses. Worry was
      reported in 14 of 16 children, anger and frustration and feeling fed up in 12 of 
      16. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to being a symptomatically disabling condition,
      Crohn's disease has a great impact on the health-related quality of life of
      affected children. Future studies of treatment in children with inflammatory
      bowel disease should include an attempt to assess the impact on the child's
      health-related quality of life.

TI  - Fat intake and fatty acid profile in plasma phospholipids and adipose tissue in
      patients with Crohn's disease, compared with controls.
PG  - 410-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Fatty acid metabolism is involved in the immune response and
      inflammation processes in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Fatty acid changes 
      may be relevant to the clinical course of the disease. The aim of this study was 
      to compare the qualitative and quantitative fat intake and fatty acid composition
      of plasma phospholipids and adipose tissue in a defined population of CD patients
      with those in matched controls. METHODS: Dietary fat intake and fatty acid
      profile of plasma phospholipids and adipose tissue were assessed in two patient
      populations: 20 patients with recently diagnosed CD and 32 patients with
      longstanding (> 10 yr) CD clinically in remission, matched for age and gender
      with healthy controls. RESULTS: We observed no significant differences in
      quantitative or qualitative fat intake between CD patients and controls.
      Percentages of linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid in plasma phospholipids or 
      adipose tissue were not significantly different between patients and controls.
      However, we observed a significantly (p < 0.05) lower percentage of the sum of
      the n-3 fatty acids, with significantly (p < 0.01) higher levels of clupanodonic 
      acid (22:5n-3) and significantly (p < 0.05) lower levels of docosahexaenoic
      (22:6n-3) and arachidonic acid (20:4n-6). The aberrant fatty acid profile was
      more evident in patients with longstanding CD than in patients with recently
      diagnosed CD. CONCLUSION: The aberrant fatty acid profile found in these CD
      patients is a result of altered metabolism rather than of essential fatty acid
      malabsorption. The reported findings may be important in the pathophysiology of
      CD and hence in the choice of fatty acids to be used when therapeutic
      supplementation is considered in CD patients.
