TI  - Biologic therapies against inflammatory bowel disease: a dysregulated immune
      system and the cross talk with gastrointestinal mucosa hold the key.
PG  - 195-212
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a GI tract disorder that manifests as either 
      Ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD). The precise etiology of IBD is
      still not completely elucidated but research into the immunopathogenesis of IBD
      suggests that dysfunctions of the intestinal immune system and cross-reactivity
      against host epithelial cells hold the key. In both UC and CD, polarized immune
      activity towards Th1 (marked by upregulation of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IFN-gamma,
      IL-6) and Th17 (marked by IL-17 secretion) response is reported, while UC appears
      to exhibit an added contribution of Th2 responses (characterized by secretion of 
      IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13). Additionally, other molecules involved in leukocyte
      trafficking (adhesion molecules), chemokines (IL-8) and tissue repair molecules
      (PGE(2) and its receptors) are also crucial. Emergence of these new paradigms in 
      the pathogenesis of IBD led to a recent trend of novel biological therapies that 
      specifically inhibit molecules involved in the inflammatory cascade. In this
      review, we critically discuss recent advances in the pathogenesis of IBD, drug
      therapies (conventional versus biologic), drug efficacy and pharmacokinetics
      (murine versus human versus chimeric) and their adverse effects. We also discuss 
      emerging novel biological therapies targeting pro-inflammatory cytokines
      including TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma, cytokine receptors and those targeting
      adhesion molecules-anti-integrin and anti-ICAM antibodies. Other potential
      approaches using anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10), anti-sense oligonucleotide 
      and probiotics are also discussed. Finally, we summarized few imperative targets 
      whose more detailed exploration can help to pave the way for an efficacious IBD
      therapy.

      Apart from the disease complications, the drugs' adverse affects, especially
      corticosteroids, are significant. In the past decade major progress was made in
      elucidating the pathogenesis of IBD, which led to new treatment options aiming to
      achieve better control of the disease and decrease the various complications of
      current therapy. In this review we provide an overview of novel therapies for
      IBD, their efficacy, safety and their current use in children.

PG  - 2419-25

AB  - Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory condition with a relapsing-remitting
      disease course. Treatment often requires both induction and maintenance
      strategies. The management of mild to moderate Crohn's disease is challenging
      because the natural history of mild disease is not known and effective treatment 
      options are limited. In this article, our objective is to provide a brief
      overview of the evidence supporting current therapies in the treatment of mild to
      moderate luminal Crohn's disease and to explore a few of the newer therapeutic
      options. As induction agents for mild to moderately active Crohn's disease, there
      is reasonable evidence to support the use of budesonide for terminal ileal and
      right colonic disease, and sulfasalazine for colonic disease. Although budesonide
      can be used in the short term (3-6 months) for maintenance of quiescent disease, 
      there are no effective therapies for the long-term maintenance of mild to
      moderate Crohn's disease. Mesalazine appears to have no role in either the
      treatment of active or quiescent disease. Currently, there is insufficient data
      to draw conclusions on the potential role of antibacterials, probiotics or
      prebiotics.

AB  - A decrease in the abundance and biodiversity of intestinal bacteria within the
      dominant phylum Firmicutes has been observed repeatedly in Crohn disease (CD)
      patients. In this study, we determined the composition of the mucosa-associated
      microbiota of CD patients at the time of surgical resection and 6 months later
      using FISH analysis. We found that a reduction of a major member of Firmicutes,
      Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, is associated with a higher risk of postoperative
      recurrence of ileal CD. A lower proportion of F. prausnitzii on resected ileal
      Crohn mucosa also was associated with endoscopic recurrence at 6 months. To
      evaluate the immunomodulatory properties of F. prausnitzii we analyzed the
      anti-inflammatory effects of F. prausnitzii in both in vitro (cellular models)
      and in vivo [2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS)-induced] colitis in mice.
      In Caco-2 cells transfected with a reporter gene for NF-kappaB activity, F.
      prausnitzii had no effect on IL-1beta-induced NF-kappaB activity, whereas the
      supernatant abolished it. In vitro peripheral blood mononuclear cell stimulation 
      by F. prausnitzii led to significantly lower IL-12 and IFN-gamma production
      levels and higher secretion of IL-10. Oral administration of either live F.
      prausnitzii or its supernatant markedly reduced the severity of TNBS colitis and 
      tended to correct the dysbiosis associated with TNBS colitis, as demonstrated by 
      real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis. F. prausnitzii exhibits
      anti-inflammatory effects on cellular and TNBS colitis models, partly due to
      secreted metabolites able to block NF-kappaB activation and IL-8 production.
      These results suggest that counterbalancing dysbiosis using F. prausnitzii as a
      probiotic is a promising strategy in CD treatment.

PG  - CD006634
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD006634.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease has a high morbidity and there is no known cure.
      Current treatments have multiple side effects and an effective treatment with
      minimal side effects is desired. Probiotics have been proposed as such a
      treatment but their efficacy is undetermined. There is some evidence that
      probiotics are effective in other conditions affecting the gastrointestinal tract
      and they are popular with patients. They are thought to work through competitive 
      action with commensal and pathogenic flora, influencing the immune response.
      OBJECTIVES: To determine if there is any evidence for the efficacy of probiotics 
      for the induction of remission in Crohn's disease. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane 
      Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 1, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 to
      2007), Excerpta Medica/EMBASE (1974 to 2007), CINAHL (1982-2007) and the Cochrane
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Functional Bowel Disorders Group Specialised Trial
      Register were searched. Manufacturers of probiotics were also contacted to
      identify any unpublished trials. References of trials were also searched for any 
      additional trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that
      compared probiotics against placebo or any other intervention for the induction
      of remission in Crohn's disease were eligible for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND 
      ANALYSIS: Data extraction and assessment of methodological quality of included
      studies were independently performed by two authors. The main outcome measure was
      the occurrence of clinical remission. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals
      were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: One small study (n = 11) 
      met the inclusion criteria and was included in the review. There were some
      methodological concerns with this study. Four of 5 patients in the probiotic
      group achieved remission compared to 5 of 6 in the placebo group (OR 0.80; 95% CI
      0.04 to 17.20). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to make any 
      conclusions about the efficacy of probiotics for induction of remission in
      Crohn's disease. There is a lack of well designed RCTs in this area and further
      research is needed.

      with Crohn's disease in remission.
PG  - 842-8
LID - 10.1080/00365520801943354 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Crohn's disease (CD) is characterized by a reduction in mucosal
      integrity that permits antigen penetration into the intestinal tissue. The
      administration of probiotics has been suggested to improve the barrier function
      of the mucosa. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of
      Saccharomyces boulardii on the intestinal permeability in CD. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: Thirty-four patients were randomized according to the Vienna
      classification for treatment with either placebo or Saccharomyces boulardii.
      Baseline medications (mesalamine, azathioprine, prednisone, metronidazole and/or 
      thalidomide) were maintained. Intestinal permeability (lactulose/mannitol ratio) 
      was evaluated immediately before the beginning of treatment and at the end of the
      first and third treatment month. Fifteen healthy volunteers were also submitted
      for the intestinal permeability test. RESULTS: In volunteers, the
      lactulose/mannitol ratio was 0.005+/-0.0037, whereas this value was 0.021+/-0.01 
      in patients with CD (p=0.001). In the placebo group, there was an increase in
      lactulose/mannitol ratio by 0.004+/-0.010 (p=0.12) at the end of the third month.
      In the S. boulardii group, there was an improvement in intestinal permeability,
      with a decrease in the lactulose/mannitol ratio by 0.008+/-0.006 (p=0.0005) in
      the same period. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CD in remission present alterations
      in the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier according to
      lactulose/mannitol ratio. S. boulardii added to baseline therapy improved
      intestinal permeability in these patients, even though complete normalization was
      not achieved.

AB  - Probiotic research and clinical trials have been forging ahead over the last
      decade. Although much has been learnt in relation to probiotic intestinal
      epithelial-mucosal immune interactions, the evidence for substantial clinical
      efficacy of probiotics continues to progress much slower. This review outlines
      the probiotic clinical studies before 2005 that formed the foundation of
      probiotic clinical trials in inflammatory bowel disease and then examines indepth
      those inflammatory bowel disease probiotic clinical trials published after 2005
      that are leading to new understanding of the role of probiotics in the induction 
      and remission of inflammatory bowel disease in humans.

PG  - 1068-83
LID - 10.1002/ibd.20448 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Differential immunoregulatory capabilities of probiotic Lactobacillus
      were explored in the context of pediatric Crohn's disease. Experimental
      strategies addressed molecular mechanisms of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
      suppression in activated macrophages by transcriptional regulation. METHODS:
      Secreted factors produced by probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri strains were
      harvested and tested with human monocytes and macrophages. Quantitative
      immunoassays and real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
      (RT-PCR) were used to examine relative quantities of human cytokines and TNF
      mRNA, respectively, and reporter assays assessed transcriptional regulation of
      TNF by probiotics. DNA-protein macroarrays interrogated probiotic-mediated
      effects on transcription factor activation. Finally, enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
      assays (ELISAs) and immunoblots examined the involvement of the specific
      transcription factor AP-1 and its components. RESULTS: Probiotic L. reuteri
      strain ATCC PTA 6475 demonstrated the ability to potently suppress human TNF
      production by lipopolysaccharide-activated monocytes and primary monocyte-derived
      macrophages from children with Crohn's disease. Quantities of the chemokine
      MCP-1/CCL2 were also reduced by probiotic L. reuteri strain ATCC PTA 6475 in
      macrophages of children in remission. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR and
      luciferase reporter assays showed that transcriptional regulation of human TNF
      was a primary mechanism of probiotic-mediated immunomodulation. Probiotic L.
      reuteri suppressed TNF transcription by inhibiting activation of MAP
      kinase-regulated c-Jun and the transcription factor, AP-1. CONCLUSIONS: Human TNF
      and MCP-1 suppression by probiotic L. reuteri was strain-dependent, and the
      activation of c-Jun and AP-1 represent primary targets for probiotic-mediated
      suppression of TNF transcription. This report emphasizes the clonal nature of
      immunoprobiosis and delineation of a specific immunomodulatory mechanism for
      probiotic strain selection in future inflammatory bowel disease-oriented clinical
      trials.

AB  - There is mounting evidence that probiotic therapy may alter disease expression in
      both animal models of IBD and in patients with IBD. The effects appear to be
      modest at best and may reflect the choice of probiotic organism, the variability 
      in concentrations of organisms administered, and the variability of the diseases 
      being treated. This review examines the data of all fully published articles
      currently available for the role of probiotics in the treatment of IBD.

AB  - The same drugs are used to treat hemorrhagic rectocolitis (HRC) and Crohn's
      disease (CD), although the aims are very different. Aminosalicylates are highly
      beneficial in HRC but virtually ineffective in CD, a disease in which
      immunosuppressants are more useful. Aminosalicylates exert their antiinflammatory
      effect directly on the lesions. Various oral and rectal preparations have been
      developed in order to deliver the active molecule to the intestinal target
      segment. These drugs are now known to act by stimulating the nuclear receptor
      PPAR-gamma, and this knowledge should help with the development of new agents.
      Chronic aminosalicylate treatment appears to diminish the risk of malignant
      transformation. Systemic steroids are still the mainstay of treatment for
      exacerbations of HRC and CD, yielding remissions in 60 to 90% of cases. In
      contrast, systemic steroids should not be used for maintenance therapy.
      Budesonide is a preparation that selectively releases steroids in the ileocolonic
      region, thereby reducing systemic adverse effects. Immunosuppressants such as
      azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine, and also methotrexate in some cases, are used 
      for maintenance therapy of steroid-dependent and highly recurrent forms. These
      drugs stabilize the disease in about half the patients who receive them.
      Treatment typically lasts several years and necessitates regular monitoring,
      especially of hematological status. Cyclosporine is used intravenously in severe 
      HRC. Infliximab (RemicadeR), a chimeric monoclonal antibody targeting TNF is
      effective in acute forms and as maintenance therapy for CD. It was also recently 
      shown to be effective in HRC. Infliximab is indicated in steroid-resistant forms 
      and contraindicated in patients with latent systemic infections (tuberculosis,
      hepatitis B) and heart failure. Artificial nutrition is now only used in children
      with acute forms, in order to avoid the need for steroids. Probiotics might have 
      a place in maintenance treatment of HRC. Surgical treatment of HRC consists of
      colectomy or, more radically, ileoprotectomy followed by ileoanal anastomosis
      with resection: however, the likely benefits and potential complications
      (especially nocturnal diarrhea) must be carefully weighed up. Surgical treatment 
      of CD consists of resecting the worst-affected segments. As available medical and
      surgical treatments can only control these diseases, without curing them, patient
      management must be planned on a long-term basis. Control of exacerbations is
      judged on the basis of clinical parameters and biological markers of
      inflammation, rather than on lesion healing. The choice of maintenance therapy
      depends on the nature of the disease (HRC or CD) and its progressive nature.
      Surgery is reserved for patients with complicated and drug-resistant forms.

PG  - 906-12
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.200700147 [doi]
AB  - The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves an interaction
      between genetically determined host susceptibility, dysregulated immune response,
      and the enteric microbiota. Ecological treatments including probiotics,
      prebiotics, and synbiotics are actively studied in Crohn's disease (CD),
      ulcerative colitis (UC) and pouchitis. We review herein the literature on the
      rational use of probiotics in IBD considering efficacy (as evaluated in
      randomized controlled trials), mechanisms of action and safety issues. A
      probiotic effect is strictly restricted to one defined strain and cannot be
      generalized from one to another. There is evidence of efficacy of some probiotic 
      drugs in pouchitis (VSL#3), and in the prevention of recurrence of UC
      (Escherichia coli Nissle 1917). However, the evidence for efficacy of probiotic
      drugs in CD is still low as well as that of dietary ecological treatments.
      Despite an ecological (hopefully nutritional) treatment of IBD is promising, many
      questions remain unanswered and further clinical and fundamental studies are
      needed.

TI  - Microbial host interactions in IBD: implications for pathogenesis and therapy.
PG  - 497-507
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and pouchitis appear to be caused 
      by pathogenic T-cell responses to discrete antigens from the complex luminal
      microbiota, with susceptibility conferred by genetic polymorphisms that regulate 
      bacterial killing, mucosal barrier function, or immune responses. Environmental
      triggers initiate or reactivate inflammation and modulate genetic susceptibility.
      New pathogenesis concepts include defective bacterial killing by innate immune
      cells in CD, colonization of the ileum in CD with functionally abnormal
      Escherichia coli that adhere to and invade epithelial cells and resist bacterial 
      killing, and alterations in enteric microbiota composition in CD, UC, and
      pouchitis detected by molecular probes. The considerable therapeutic potential of
      manipulating the enteric microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease patients has
      not been realized, probably due to failure to recognize heterogenic disease
      mechanisms that require individualized use of antibiotics, probiotics,
      prebiotics, combination therapies, and genetically engineered bacteria to restore
      mucosal homeostasis.

TI  - A meta-analysis on the efficacy of probiotics for maintenance of remission and
      prevention of clinical and endoscopic relapse in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 2524-31
LID - 10.1007/s10620-007-0171-0 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether probiotics maintain remission in patients with
      Crohn's disease (CD). DESIGN: A meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials.
      METHODS: PUBMED and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched 
      for clinical trial studies investigated the efficacy of probiotics for the
      maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. Clinical relapse and endoscopic
      relapse were the key outcomes of interest. Data were searched within the time
      period of 1966 through May 2007. RESULT: Eight randomized placebo-controlled
      clinical trials met our criteria and were included in the analysis. Seven
      determined clinical relapse and three evaluated endoscopic relapse among patients
      with CD received probiotics for maintenance of remission. Pooling of seven trials
      for the outcome of clinical relapse yielded an odds ratio of 0.92 (95% confidence
      interval of 0.52-1.62, P = 0.8853), a nonsignificant odds ratio. The odds ratio
      for three studies for the outcome of endoscopic relapse was 0.97 (95% confidence 
      interval of 0.54-1.78, P = 0.93), a nonsignificant odds ratio. CONCLUSION: This
      meta-analysis fails to demonstrate the efficacy of probiotics in maintaining
      remission and preventing clinical and endoscopic recurrence in CD. It is
      suggested to use probiotic preparations containing a mixture of lactobacillus
      with E. coli or Saccharomyces.

TI  - Evidence for the involvement of infectious agents in the pathogenesis of Crohn's 
      disease.
PG  - 845-52
AB  - Many advances have been made in the understanding of Crohn's disease (CD)
      pathogenesis during the last decade. CD is currently seen as a predominantly
      T-lymphocyte-driven disease characterized by the presence of a complex cocktail
      of interacting cytokines, chemokines and other mediators produced by a variety of
      cell types. Prevailing theories of CD pathogenesis suggest that patients'
      T-lymphocytes are inappropriately activated in the setting of an immune
      imbalance, which is itself caused by an unfortunate confluence of genetic and
      environmental factors. The T-cell response then leads to the chronic inflammation
      characteristic for the disease. Various environmental factors may play a role in 
      the development of CD, but microbes are most consistently implied. This theory is
      based on epidemiological, clinicopathological, genetic and experimental evidence.
      Despite the abundance of arguments for the implication of bacteria in the
      aetiopathogenesis of CD, the precise role of bacteria in this disease still
      remains elusive. Three not necessarily mutually exclusive theories have been
      proposed: (1) an unidentified persistent pathogen; (2) an abnormally permeable
      mucosal barrier leading to excessive bacterial translocation; and (3) a breakdown
      in the balance between putative "protective" versus "harmful" intestinal bacteria
      ("dysbiosis"). At present, one cannot exclude with certainty any of these three
      proposed hypotheses; they may all apply to CD to a certain extent.

PG  - 130-5
LID - 10.1159/000111027 [doi]
AB  - At 1 year after a first resection, up to 80% of patients show an endoscopic
      recurrence, 10-20% have clinical relapse, and 5% have surgical recurrence.
      Smoking is one of the most important risk factors for postoperative recurrence.
      Preoperative disease activity and the severity of endoscopic lesions in the
      neoterminal ileum within the first postoperative year are predictors of
      symptomatic recurrence. Mesalazine is generally the first-line treatment used in 
      the postoperative setting but still provokes considerable controversy as to its
      efficacy, in spite of the results of a meta-analysis. Immunosuppressive treatment
      (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine) is based on scant evidence but is currently used
      as a second-line treatment in postsurgical patients at high risk for recurrence, 
      with symptoms or with early endoscopic lesions in the neoterminal ileum.
      Nitroimidazole antibiotics (metronidazole, ornidazole) are also effective in the 
      control of active Crohn's disease in the postoperative setting. Given their known
      toxicity, they may be used as a third-line treatment as initial short-term
      prevention therapy rather than in the long term. Conventional corticosteroids,
      budesonide or probiotics have no proven role in postoperative prophylaxis.
      Infliximab has not as yet been studied for use in the prevention of relapse after
      surgery.

TI  - The use of a nursing model to understand diarrhea and the role of probiotics in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 418-23; quiz 424-5
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease, an umbrella term used for Crohn disease and
      ulcerative colitis, is often accompanied with the presenting symptom of diarrhea.
      This symptom can be a great nuisance and emotionally distressing to the
      individual with inflammatory bowel disease. Although the exact etiology of
      inflammatory bowel disease is still unknown, interactions between the host
      susceptibility, mucosal immunity, and intestinal microflora are thought to be
      major factors. One intervention that is gaining increasing support by the
      research and medical community is the use of probiotics, which work on the
      intestinal flora by altering the bacterial composition and thereby rendering the 
      environment unfavorable to pathogenic organisms. The human response to illness
      model provides an ideal organizing framework to gain a comprehensive
      understanding of the human response of diarrhea in the inflammatory bowel disease
      population. By examining the physiological, pathophysiological, behavioral, and
      experiential perspectives as well as individual vulnerabilities, this model
      establishes sound rationale to guide nursing interventions to help the individual
      better cope with the physical and emotional effects of having diarrhea. This
      model also facilitates the provision of holistic and personalized care, which may
      include the use of probiotics to help alleviate this distressing symptom.

AB  - Probiotics are bacteria or fungi, which modulate pathogenic growth and invasion
      of the bowel. The most frequently used are Lactobacillus and Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae. They are widely used as dietary supplements or for the treatment and 
      prevention of various types of diarrhoea. Probiotics are generally considered as 
      safe, but some cases of invasive infections have been described in different
      patient populations. This article reviews the literature about the indications
      and risks of probiotics, especially in immunocompromised patients.

TI  - Probiotics in the management of colonic disorders.
PG  - 434-40
AB  - Probiotics have been used in humans for almost a century and widely recommended
      for the treatment of a variety of ills assumed to be of colonic origin, including
      diarrhea, constipation, bloating, and flatulence. More recently, probiotics have 
      been evaluated in the management of specific colonic disorders such as
      inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and Clostridium difficile
      colitis. It is evident that no two probiotics are exactly alike; why then should 
      we expect reproducible results from studies that employ different species or
      strains, variable formulations, and diverse dosing schedules? When probiotics
      have been studied with the rigor appropriate to a new therapeutic modality, some 
      coherent results have emerged: specific strains are effective in certain
      diarrheal states, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis, as
      well as in the prevention of C. difficile-related colitis. Even here, not to
      mention other colonic disorders, further adequately powered and appropriately
      designed trials are needed.

TI  - [The role of translational research in inflammatory bowel disease].
PG  - 146-53
AB  - The idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases, broadly classified as either Crohn's 
      disease or ulcerative colitis, are caused by a dysregulated mucosal immune
      response to a luminal antigen, possibly a bacterium, in a genetically predisposed
      host. A rapid expansion of knowledge in recent years has greatly increased our
      understanding of the pathophysiology of these disorders. For example, the
      relatively recent discovery of the NOD2 gene, a protein involved in bacterial
      sensing, has provided further evidence of the complex interplay between hosts and
      microbes in Crohn's disease. Significant recent advances have also occurred with 
      the discovery of the role of Toll-like receptors and dendritic cells in the
      development of gut inflammation, and the role of proinflammatory cytokines in the
      development and potentiation of gut inflammation. This article presents an update
      on these key developments and emphasizes the translational aspects of research
      that are directly related to patient care.

PG  - 2572S-2575S
LID - 10.1093/jn/137.11.2572S [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, also called chronic inflammatory bowel
      diseases (IBD), affect up to 500 per 100,000 persons in the Western world. Recent
      studies in the etiology of IBD suggest that these diseases are caused by a
      combination of genetic, environmental, and immunological factors. Results from
      humans and especially animal models of colitis reported by our group and others
      have indicated that these diseases result from a lack of tolerance to resident
      intestinal bacteria in genetically susceptible hosts. Probiotic bacteria have
      health-promoting effects for the host when ingested and have also shown efficacy 
      in ulcerative colitis and refractory pouchitis. In light of the efficacy of
      providing probiotic bacteria to patients with IBD, there has been interest in the
      prophylactic and therapeutic potential of inulin, oligofructose, and other
      prebiotics for patients with or at risk of IBD. Prebiotics are nondigestible
      dietary oligosaccharides that affect the host by selectively stimulating growth, 
      activity, or both of selective intestinal (probiotic) bacteria. Prebiotics are
      easy to administer and, in contrast to probiotic therapy, do not require
      administration of large amounts of (live) bacteria and are therefore easier to
      administer. Studies using prebiotics, especially beta-fructan oligosaccharides,
      for the treatment of chronic intestinal inflammation have shown benefit in animal
      models of colitis. Studies using these prebiotics alone or in combination with
      probiotics are emerging and have shown promise. These dietary therapies could
      lead to novel treatments for these chronic debilitating diseases.

TI  - Recent advances in the medical therapy of Crohn's disease in childhood.
PG  - 2553-68
AB  - Crohn's disease (CrD) is characterised by an ongoing inflammatory response in the
      gut, in the absence of an obvious trigger. The treatment of CrD in children,
      during relapse and remission, requires special consideration of growth and
      development. This review addresses the use of present medical management
      strategies, including enteral nutrition, corticosteroids, immunosuppression and
      anti-TNF-alpha therapies. Anti-inflammatory IL-11 and leukocyte adhesion
      inhibitors have shown only moderate clinical efficacy in adults. Emerging
      treatments directed against the inflammatory cascade under investigation include 
      inhibitors of IL-6 and -12, IFN-gamma and MAPKs. Probiotics and colony
      stimulating factors aim to stimulate the innate immune system. Research data from
      clinical trials are reviewed and summarised in respect of their potential within 
      paediatric practice.

TI  - Review article: the evidence base for interventions used to maintain remission in
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 11-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is characterised by recurrent flare-ups alternating
      with periods of remission. A number of interventions are currently used in
      clinical practice to try and maintain remission in Crohn's disease but the
      evidence base for some of them may be questionable. AIM: To review the available 
      evidence on interventions, which are currently used to maintain remission in
      Crohn's disease. METHODS: The Cochrane Library and Medline (Pubmed) were searched
      for level 1 evidence on specific interventions. Search terms included 'Crohn's
      disease or synonyms', 'remission or synonyms' and the names of specific
      interventions. RESULTS: Azathioprine, infliximab and adalimumab are effective at 
      maintaining remission in Crohn's disease. Natalizumab is also effective, but
      there are concerns about its potential association with progressive multifocal
      leukoencephalopathy. Long-term enteral nutritional supplementation,
      enteric-coated omega-3 fatty acids and intramuscular methotrexate may also be
      effective but the evidence for these is based on relatively small studies. The
      available evidence does not support the use of oral 5-aminosalicylates agents,
      corticosteroids, anti-mycobacterial agents, probiotics or ciclosporin as
      maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease. CONCLUSION: A better understanding of the
      evidence base of existing interventions could result in the use of treatments,
      which are more likely to lead to improved patient outcomes.

TI  - The mechanism of action of probiotics.
PG  - 679-92
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Probiotics are a heterogeneous group of nonpathologic bacteria
      that are functionally defined by their ability to allay inflammation when
      introduced into the inflamed intestine. The purpose of this review is to discuss 
      recent data bearing on the possible mechanisms of action of these bacteria, with 
      a particular focus on the relation of these mechanisms to the pathogenesis of
      inflammatory bowel disease, their main arena of use. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies of 
      probiotic activity in recent years provide evidence that probiotics counter
      experimental and human gastrointestinal inflammation (human inflammatory bowel
      disease) by their effects on epithelial cell function, including epithelial cell 
      barrier function, epithelial cytokine secretion, and their antibacterial effects 
      relating to colonization of the epithelial layer. In addition, there is emerging 
      evidence that probiotics induce regulatory T cells that act as a break on the
      effector T cells that would otherwise cause inflammation. SUMMARY: This review of
      probiotics and inflammatory bowel disease marshals support for the concept that
      administration of probiotics ameliorates inflammation by exerting positive
      effects on the epithelial cell dysfunction and mucosal immune system dysfunction 
      that forms the basis of the inflammation.

TI  - High dose probiotic and prebiotic cotherapy for remission induction of active
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1199-204
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical trials of probiotic treatment for Crohn's disease (CD) have 
      yielded conflicting results. This study assessed the clinical usefulness of
      combined probiotic and prebiotic therapy in the treatment of active CD. METHOD:
      Ten active CD outpatients without history of operation for CD were enrolled.
      Their mean (+/-SD) age was 27 +/- 7 years and the main symptoms presented were
      diarrhea and abdominal pain. Patients' initial therapeutic regimen of
      aminosalicylates and prednisolone failed to achieve remission. Patients were thus
      initiated on a synbiotic therapy, consisting of both probiotics (75 billion
      colony forming units [CFU] daily) and prebiotics (psyllium 9.9 g daily).
      Probiotics mainly comprised Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. Patients were free
      to adjust their intake of probiotics or prebiotics throughout the trial. Crohn's 
      disease activity index (CDAI), International Organization for the Study of
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IOIBD) score and blood sample variables were
      evaluated and compared before and after the trial. RESULTS: The duration of the
      trial was 13.0 +/- 4.5 months. By the end of therapy, each patient had taken a 45
      +/- 24 billion CFU daily probiotic dose, with six patients taking an additional
      7.9 +/- 3.6 g daily psyllium dose. Seven patients had improved clinical symptoms 
      following combined probiotic and prebiotic therapy. Both CDAI and IOIBD scores
      were significantly reduced after therapy (255-136, P = 0.009; 3.5-2.1, P = 0.03, 
      respectively). Six patients had a complete response, one had a partial response, 
      and three were non-responders. Two patients were able to discontinue their
      prednisolone therapy, while four patients decreased their intake. There were no
      adverse events. CONCLUSION: High-dose probiotic and prebiotic cotherapy can be
      safely and effectively used for the treatment of active CD.

TI  - Evidence for the use of probiotics and prebiotics in inflammatory bowel disease: 
      a review of clinical trials.
PG  - 307-15
AB  - Human subjects and their enteric microbiota have evolved together to reach a
      state of mutual tolerance. Mounting evidence from both animal models and human
      studies suggests that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents a malfunction
      of this relationship. The enteric microecology therefore represents an attractive
      therapeutic target with few side effects. Probiotics and prebiotics have been
      investigated in clinical trials as treatments for IBD, with conflicting results. 
      The evidence for the use of probiotics in the management of pouchitis is
      persuasive and several studies indicate their effectiveness in ulcerative
      colitis. Trials of probiotics and prebiotics in Crohn's disease are less
      convincing. However, methodologies vary widely and a range of probiotic,
      prebiotic and combination (synbiotic) treatments have been tested in a variety of
      patient groups with an assortment of end points. Conclusions about any one
      treatment in a specific patient group can therefore only be drawn on evidence
      from relatively small numbers of patients. The present article reviews the role
      of the intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBD and addresses the
      clinical evidence for the therapeutic manipulation of bowel microbiota using
      probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics in IBD.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease: clinical aspects and established and evolving
      therapies.
PG  - 1641-57
AB  - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are two idiopathic inflammatory bowel
      disorders. In this paper we discuss the current diagnostic approach, their
      pathology, natural course, and common complications, the assessment of disease
      activity, extraintestinal manifestations, and medical and surgical management,
      and provide diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms. We critically review the
      evidence for established (5-aminosalicylic acid compounds, corticosteroids,
      immunomodulators, calcineurin inhibitors) and emerging novel therapies--including
      biological therapies--directed at cytokines (eg, infliximab, adalimumab,
      certolizumab pegol) and receptors (eg, visilizumab, abatacept) involved in T-cell
      activation, selective adhesion molecule blockers (eg, natalizumab, MLN-02,
      alicaforsen), anti-inflammatory cytokines (eg, interleukin 10), modulation of the
      intestinal flora (eg, antibiotics, prebiotics, probiotics), leucocyte apheresis
      and many more monoclonal antibodies, small molecules, recombinant growth factors,
      and MAP kinase inhibitors targeting various inflammatory cells and pathways.
      Finally, we summarise the practical aspects of standard therapies including
      dosing, precautions, and side-effects.

TI  - Crohn's disease intestinal CD4+ T cells have impaired interleukin-10 production
      which is not restored by probiotic bacteria.
PG  - 592-601
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Crohn's disease (CD) has been associated with low mucosal interleukin 
      (IL)-10 production, but the mechanism behind this deficiency remains unclear. The
      aim of this study was to investigate IL-10 and interferon (IFN)-gamma production 
      in intestinal CD4+ T cells from CD patients and healthy volunteers (HV) and to
      examine how this was affected by bacterial products and the presence or absence
      of autologous dendritic cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We cultured intestinal CD4+ 
      T cells from CD patients (n=9) and HV (n=6) and differentiated dendritic cells
      from their peripheral monocytes. Intestinal T cells were stimulated with
      Lactobacillus strains or autologous intestinal bacteria in the presence or
      absence of dendritic cells. IL-10 and IFN-gamma were measured on day 4. RESULTS: 
      When there were autologous dendritic cells present, CD intestinal T cells
      produced high levels of IFN-gamma (mean 6.4 ng/ml+/-standard error of the mean
      1.1 ng/ml) but low levels of IL-10 (0.7 ng/ml+/-0.1 ng/ml). In contrast, HV
      intestinal T cells produced less IFN-gamma (3.9 ng/ml+/-0.8 ng/ml, p=0.06) and
      more IL-10 (4.6 ng/ml+/-0.9 ng/ml, p=0.0001) than CD intestinal T cells.
      Co-culture with Lactobacilli failed to revert this imbalance in CD, but tended to
      do so in HV. When there were no dendritic cells, CD intestinal T cells responded 
      to autologous bacteria with an increased IFN-gamma production (2.3+/-1.3 ng/ml)
      compared with HV intestinal T cells (0.3+/-0.2 ng/ml). CONCLUSIONS: Crohn's
      disease intestinal CD4+ T cells display a pro-inflammatory cytokine profile with 
      impaired production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10. Tolerogenic bacteria
      (Lactobacilli) failed to restore this regulatory defect.

AB  - In Crohn disease, a vigorous inflammatory cascade is caused by the overactivation
      of helper T-cells in the gastrointestinal system. The results of this
      inflammation manifest themselves as the symptoms of Crohn disease. This article
      describes the pathophysiology of Crohn disease as well as multiple pharmacologic 
      and nonpharmacologic interventions that may assist patients with Crohn disease in
      preventing exacerbations and maintaining longer remissions.

AB  - Standard treatment for IBD with 5-ASA, steroids and immunosuppressants is rather 
      effective and currently optimized using combinations of drugs or application
      routes. Among the biologics only infliximab has reached the therapeutic arsenal
      for Crohn's disease--it is as well effective in some patients with ulcerative
      colitis. Early aggressive treatment thus far is not established. Hormones and
      growth factors may play a role. Probiotics have a place in the treatment in
      particular for ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Failure of Synbiotic 2000 to prevent postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 385-9
AB  - Complications of Crohn's disease (CD) lead to surgery in about 70-90% of
      patients. The majority of patients suffer from relapse of the disease. Colonic
      bacteria are essential to the development of CD. Therefore, a rationale exists in
      trying to prevent relapse by manipulation of gut microflora. This is feasible by 
      treatment with probiotics or antibiotics. Synbiotic 2000 is a cocktail containing
      4 probiotic species and 4 prebiotics. It is rational to pursue that it could be
      effective in preventing postoperative disease. We sought to check weather
      treatment with Synbiotic 2000 could prevent postoperative recurrence in patients 
      with CD. This was a prospective multicenter, randomized study. Patients were
      randomized to active treatment or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. Follow-up consisted of 
      endoscopic, clinical, and laboratory parameters. Thirty patients were enrolled.
      No differences were found between the 2 treatment groups regarding gender, age at
      diagnosis, age at surgery, weight, smoking status, type of disease, length of the
      resected segment, or medical treatment prior to surgery. No difference in either 
      endoscopic or clinical relapse rate was found between patients treated with once 
      daily dose of Synbiotic 2000 or placebo. In our small study, Synbiotic 2000 had
      no effect on postoperative recurrence of patients with CD. Larger studies in
      patients with the inflammatory type of CD undergoing surgery, using higher doses 
      of probiotics cocktail might prove effective.

TI  - Multicenter randomized-controlled clinical trial of probiotics (Lactobacillus
      johnsonii, LA1) on early endoscopic recurrence of Crohn's disease after
      lleo-caecal resection.
PG  - 135-42
AB  - BACKGROUND: Seventy percent of Crohn's disease (CD) patients exhibit anastomotic 
      recurrence within 1 year after ileo-caecal surgery. Recent clinical trials
      suggest the beneficial use of probiotics in the control of intestinal
      inflammation in pouchitis and ulcerative colitis. This study is a multicenter
      clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of an oral administration of the probiotic
      LAl on early post-operative endoscopic recurrence of CD. METHODS: Seventy
      patients with CD were enrolled prior to elective ileo-caecal resection and
      randomly assigned after surgery to daily treatment with either Lactobacillus
      johnsonii, LA1, Nestle (1010 colony-forming units, CFU) (group A, n = 34) or
      placebo (group B, n = 36) for 12 weeks. The primary objective was to assess the
      effect of LAl on the endoscopic recurrence rate at 12 weeks. Stratification was
      performed according to smoking status at randomization. RESULTS: Seven and 14
      patients were excluded in the LA1 and placebo groups, respectively. In
      intention-to-treat analysis, the mean endoscopic score was not significantly
      different between the two treatment groups at 3 months (LA1 versus placebo: 1.50 
      +/- 1.32 versus 1.22+/-1.37, treatment effect: P = 0.48, smoke effect: P = 0.72).
      The percentage of patients with severe recurrence (i3 + i4) was 21% and 15% in
      the LAl and placebo groups, respectively (P = 0.33). Using a per-protocol (PP)
      analysis, the mean endoscopic score was not significantly different between the
      two treatment groups (LAl versus placebo groups: 1.44 +/-1.31 versus 1.05 +/-
      1.21, P = 0.32). The percentage of patients with severe recurrence (i3 + i4) was 
      19% and 9% in the LAl and placebo groups, respectively (P = 0.054). Clinical
      relapse rate (CDAI [CD activity index] > 150, with an increase of CDAI > 70
      points or greater from baseline) in the LAl and placebo groups was 15% (4/27) and
      13.5% (3/22), respectively (PP analysis: chi-square test, P = 0.91 and log-rank
      test: P = 0.79). CONCLUSION: Oral administration of the probiotic LA1 in patients
      with CD failed to prevent early endoscopic recurrence at 12 weeks after
      ileo-caecal resection.

TI  - Patchy distribution of mucosal lesions in ileal Crohn's disease is not linked to 
      differences in the dominant mucosa-associated bacteria: a study using
      fluorescence in situ hybridization and temporal temperature gradient gel
      electrophoresis.
PG  - 684-92
AB  - BACKGROUND: The mucosa-associated bacteria (MAB) are suspected of being involved 
      in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. We analyzed and compared the MAB in
      noninflamed and inflamed ileal mucosa of Crohn's disease patients (n = 22).
      METHODS: Tissue samples from the inflamed ileal mucosa and from the adjacent
      noninflamed ileal mucosa were taken from surgical resection specimens. The MAB
      were investigated using fluorescence in situ hybridization with 7 group-specific 
      probes and temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE). RESULTS:
      Samples from both noninflamed and inflamed mucosa were obtained from 15 patients.
      The distribution of the bacterial populations was not different between
      noninflamed and inflamed mucosa. The Bacteroidetes phylum was dominant and
      accounted for 29% of MAB (0%-74%) in noninflamed tissues and 32% (0%-70%) in
      inflamed areas. The gamma Proteobacteria represented 12% (0%-70%) of MAB both in 
      noninflamed and inflamed areas. The Clostridium coccoides group (Firmicutes
      phylum) represented 15% of MAB in noninflamed tissues versus 7% in inflamed
      areas. For most of the patients the similarity index between TTGE paired profiles
      was very high. CONCLUSION: The dominant MAB do not differ between noninflamed and
      inflamed ileal mucosa in Crohn's disease. This argues against a localized
      dysbiosis to explain the patchy distribution of mucosal lesions.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Crohn's disease is a long-term chronic condition of the
      gastrointestinal tract. It is characterised by transmural, granulomatous
      inflammation that occurs in a discontinuous pattern, with a tendency to form
      fistulae. The cause is unknown but may depend on interactions between genetic
      predisposition, environmental triggers, and mucosal immunity. METHODS AND
      OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following
      clinical questions: What are the effects of medical treatments in adults to
      induce remission in Crohn's disease? What are the effects of lifestyle
      interventions in adults with Crohn's disease to maintain remission? What are the 
      effects of surgical interventions in adults with small-bowel Crohn's disease to
      induce remission? What are the effects of surgical interventions in adults with
      colonic Crohn's disease to induce remission? What are the effects of medical
      interventions to maintain remission in adults with Crohn's disease; and to
      maintain remission following surgery? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane 
      Library and other important databases up to March 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews
      are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date
      version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations
      such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and
      Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 60 systematic
      reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria.
      CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the
      effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: aminosalicylates,
      antibiotics, azathioprine/mercaptopurine, ciclosporin, corticosteroids (oral),
      enteral nutrition, fish oil, infliximab, methotrexate, probiotics, resection,
      segmental colectomy, smoking cessation, and strictureplasty.

PG  - 1-3
AB  - Functional human proteins are constitutively produced in genetically modified
      bacteria that survive on human mucosal surfaces, to the benefit of the host. The 
      successful Phase I clinical trial with IL-10-producing Lactococcus lactis for
      Crohn's disease has opened new avenues for the use of transgenic bacteria as
      delivery vehicles. The major advantage of this novel strategy is the avoidance of
      systemic side effects associated with conventional therapies. This methodology
      opens up an alternative method for local delivery of therapeutic proteins to
      various mucosal tissues.

TI  - Adherent-invasive Escherichia coli and Crohn's disease.
PG  - 16-20
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The identification of mutations in the nucleotide
      oligomerization domain 2-encoding gene in patients with Crohn's disease suggests 
      a link between the innate immune response to invasive bacteria and the
      development of Crohn's disease. Herein, we review reports concerning the
      association of pathogenic Escherichia coli with the intestinal mucosa of Crohn's 
      disease patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Adherent-invasive E. coli were isolated from
      ileal biopsies of 36.4% of patients with ileal Crohn's disease. Adherent-invasive
      E. coli colonize the intestinal mucosa by adhering to intestinal epithelial
      cells. They are also true invasive pathogens, able to invade intestinal
      epithelial cells and to replicate intracellularly. Adherent-invasive E. coli
      strains replicate extensively into macrophages inducing the secretion of very
      large amounts of tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Similar pathogenic E. coli strains 
      were recently associated with granulomatous colitis of Boxer dogs. Interestingly,
      high levels of E. coli outer membrane protein C antibodies are present in 37-55% 
      of Crohn's disease patients and reactivity to outer membrane protein C is
      associated with increased severity of Crohn's disease. SUMMARY: As the infection 
      cycle of adherent-invasive E. coli could depend upon the ability of these
      pathogenic bacteria to colonize the gastrointestinal tract of genetically
      predisposed Crohn's disease patients, antibiotics which could eradicate the
      bacteria, or probiotics which could substitute them in the gastrointestinal
      tract, could be of therapeutic value in ileal Crohn's disease.
