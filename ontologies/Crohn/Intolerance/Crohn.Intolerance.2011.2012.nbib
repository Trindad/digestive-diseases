AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Over 10% of Crohn's disease (CD) patients annually lose
      response to infliximab. Infliximab trough levels (TL), concomitant
      immunosuppressants and endoscopic healing were proposed as predictors of
      favourable infliximab outcome. We assessed infliximab TL measured after induction
      therapy as predictors of sustained clinical response. Furthermore, we tried to
      identify other predictors of long-term benefit of infliximab therapy. METHODS: We
      included CD patients treated with infliximab between October 2007 and March 2010 
      who responded to 3-dose induction followed by maintenance therapy and in whom
      blood samples taken at treatment week 14 or 22 were available in blood bank.
      Sustained response to infliximab was defined as absence of treatment failure due 
      to loss of response or drug intolerance. RESULTS: Eighty four patients were
      included. Sustained response to infliximab was observed in 47 (56%) patients
      during a median follow-up of 25 months (14-37). Infliximab TL>3mug/ml were
      associated with a decreased risk of treatment failure (HR 0.34; 95% CI:
      0.16-0.75), whereas the presence of antibodies against infliximab and need for
      corticosteroids increased this risk (HR 4.34; 95% CI: 1.51-12.5 and HR 2.49, 95% 
      CI: 1.08-5.73, respectively). No impact of concomitant thiopurines was observed, 
      although patients receiving thiopurines had higher infliximab TL than those
      without immunomodulators (5.51 vs. 0.71mug/ml; p=0.01). CONCLUSION: During a
      median follow up of 2 years sustained response to infliximab was observed in
      slightly more than half of CD patients. Infliximab TL>3mug/ml at the start of
      maintenance regime were predicative of sustained response to infliximab.

TI  - Does co-treatment with immunosuppressors improve outcome in patients with Crohn's
      disease treated with adalimumab?
PG  - 1040-8
LID - 10.1111/apt.12076 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is clear benefit from combination therapy with infliximab and
      immunosuppressive drugs (IS), but few data are available for adalimumab (ADA).
      AIM: To assess the efficacy of ADA monotherapy and ADA+IS for induction and
      maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease. METHODS: Retrospective study of patients 
      with Crohn's disease treated with ADA in Oxford, UK or Liege, Belgium. Treatment 
      periods were divided into 6-month semesters. A combination therapy semester was
      defined as ADA+IS for at least 3 months; successful induction meant clinical
      response; a semester with flare as ADA dose escalation, starting steroids,
      perianal complication, or surgery; and ADA failure as ADA withdrawal for
      secondary loss of response or intolerance. Semesters with and without flares were
      compared through univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Successful
      induction was achieved in 171/207 (83%) patients, with no significant difference 
      between ADA+IS and ADA monotherapy (85% vs. 82%, P = 0.50). Five hundred and
      sixty-two semesters in 181 patients were included for maintenance analysis.
      ADA+IS was not associated with fewer semesters with flare (34% vs. 35%, P =
      0.96), or with ADA failure (6% vs. 8%, P = 0.43). Nevertheless, combination
      therapy in the first semester was associated with a lower risk of ADA failure (5%
      vs. 10%, P = 0.04, OR = 0.48) and combination therapy beyond 6 months was
      associated with fewer semesters with flares (14% vs. 36%, P = 0.02, OR = 0.31).
      CONCLUSIONS: There may be a benefit from adalimumab+immunosuppressive drugs
      combination therapy during the first semester of initiating adalimumab, with a
      slight decrease in adalimumab failure and lower need for adalimumab dosage
      escalation.

TI  - Optimal assessment of paediatric IBD with MRI and barium follow-through.
PG  - 758-62
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3182460111 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The present UK criterion standard for assessing children with
      suspected inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is upper endoscopy, ileocolonoscopy,
      and barium follow-through (BaFT). Significant doses of radiation, unpalatable
      contrast, and volume intolerance are involved with BaFT. Practice in
      investigating Crohn disease (CD) is changing with the increasing use of magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI). The aim of the present study was to compare BaFT and a
      new abdominal MRI protocol in a paediatric IBD population. METHODS: All
      consecutive patients with a new diagnosis of IBD or requiring reassessment from
      September 2008 to December 2010 were investigated with both abdominal MRI and
      BaFT in accordance with a specific local paediatric IBD protocol. The studies
      were reported by nonblinded radiologists with an interest in gastrointestinal
      imaging. The reports were compared in conjunction with case note review. RESULTS:
      Eighty-seven patients underwent both BaFT and MRI abdomen. Thirty-one percent of 
      patients had additional pathology on MRI, not seen on the BaFT. Sixty-seven
      percent of patients (n=59) had an MRI finding equivalent to BaFT. Using histology
      as a criterion standard for detecting terminal ileal disease, BaFT had a
      sensitivity and specificity of 76% and 67%, and MRI had a sensitivity and
      specificity of 83% and 95%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest series
      of small bowel MRI in a paediatric population. MRI reports were at least
      equivalent to BaFT. MRI had higher sensitivity and, particularly, specificity in 
      detecting terminal ileal pathology. These findings suggest that MRI should become
      the criterion standard investigation in children with IBD in centres with
      appropriate expertise, with zero radiation exposure being highly advantageous.

      colitis.
PG  - 1-18
LID - 10.1007/s10787-011-0104-6 [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are two chronic inflammatory bowel
      diseases. Current biologic therapies are limited to blocking tumor necrosis
      factor alpha. However, some patients are primary non-responders, experience a
      loss of response, intolerance or side effects defining the urgent unmet need for 
      novel treatments. The rapid recruitment and inappropriate retention of leukocytes
      is a hallmark of chronic inflammation and a potentially promising therapeutic
      target. We discuss the immunological mechanisms of leukocyte homing and adhesion 
      in the gut mucosa. The interaction of lymphocytes (CD4+ T-cells, CD8+ T-cells,
      T(REG), T(H)1, T(H)17, B-cells), monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells and
      granulocytes with endothelial and epithelial cells through integrins [alpha4beta7
      (LPAM-1), alpha(E)beta(7) (HML1 Human Mucosal Lymphocyte Antigen 1),
      alpha(4)beta(1) (VLA-4), alpha(L)beta(7), (LFA-1)] and their ligands
      immunoglobulin superfamily cellular adhesion molecules (CAM) (MAdCAM-1 Mucosal
      Addressin Cellular Adhesion Molecule 1, ICAM-1 Intercellular Cell Adhesion
      Molecule, VCAM-1 Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule), fibronectin as well as
      chemokine receptors (CCR2, CCR4, CCR5, CCR7, CCR9, CCR10, CXCR3, CX3CR1) and
      chemokines [CCL5, CCL25 (TECK Thymus Expressed Chemokine), CCL28, CX3CL1, CXCL10,
      CXCL12] in the process of gut homing is critically reviewed and summarized in
      scientific cartoons. Moreover, we discuss the clinical trial results of approved 
      and investigational antibodies and small molecules including natalizumab
      (anti-alpha(4) Tysabri(R), Antegren(R)), AJM300 (anti-alpha4), etrolizumab
      (anti-beta7, rhuMAb-Beta7), vedolizumab (anti-alpha4beta7, LDP-02, MLN-02,
      MLN0002), PF-00547659 (anti-MAdCAM), Alicaforsen (anti-ICAM-1), and CCX282-B
      (anti-CCR9, GSK-1605786, Traficet-EN) and their risks such as PML reported for
      natalizumab. Hopefully, the newer gut specific drug designs discussed in this
      article will have an impact on both efficacy and safety.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of methotrexate therapy for refractory Crohn's disease:
      a large single-centre experience.
PG  - 284-91
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2011.04925.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Randomised controlled trials demonstrate that methotrexate is
      effective in inducing remission and preventing relapse of Crohn's disease (CD) as
      a first-line immunosuppressant, but efficacy data after failure with, or
      intolerance to, thiopurines are limited. AIMS: To report efficacy of methotrexate
      in a cohort of refractory CD patients, most of whom had not responded to, or were
      intolerant of, thiopurines. METHODS: Data were collected for patients receiving
      methotrexate for active CD. Response to methotrexate induction therapy at 4
      months, and sustained clinical benefit at last point of follow-up with
      maintenance therapy, were assessed via physician's global assessment. Demographic
      and disease factors predicting response, or sustained clinical benefit, were
      examined by univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Sixty-six [38 (54%)
      female patients, mean age at diagnosis 29.4 years] patients received methotrexate
      between 2001 and 2010, 61 (92%) of whom received the drug parenterally. Sixty
      patients had failed, or were intolerant of, thiopurines. Response to therapy at 4
      months occurred in 54 (82%) patients. However, sustained clinical benefit
      occurred in only 19 (29%) patients at last point of follow-up, including six
      patients who discontinued the drug for family planning reasons. No predictors of 
      response or sustained clinical benefit were identified. Adverse events occurred
      in 20 (30%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that methotrexate is
      effective in terms of initial response in Crohn's disease patients who have
      failed, or are intolerant of, thiopurines. However, efficacy is not sustained in 
      the long term.

TI  - Switch to adalimumab in patients with Crohn's disease controlled by maintenance
      infliximab: prospective randomised SWITCH trial.
PG  - 229-34
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2011-300755 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Elective switching between anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) agents
      not necessarily dictated by efficacy or tolerability occurs in clinical practice.
      A study was undertaken to evaluate prospectively the impact of elective switching
      of patients with Crohn's disease well controlled with intravenous infliximab to
      subcutaneous adalimumab in a controlled trial. METHODS: An open-label randomised 
      single-centre trial recruited 73 patients with ongoing response to at least 6
      months of scheduled maintenance infliximab. Patients were randomised to continue 
      intravenous 5 mg/kg infliximab or to switch to subcutaneous adalimumab 80 mg at
      baseline followed by 40 mg every other week for 1 year. Dose optimisation was
      allowed for intermittent flares, and patients with loss of response or
      intolerance could cross over to the alternative treatment group. Tolerability,
      patient preference and efficacy of both treatment options were the primary
      outcomes. RESULTS: Dose optimisation or interruption of treatment occurred in
      17/36 patients (47%) in the adalimumab group and in 6/37 patients (16%) in the
      infliximab group (p=0.006). One patient interrupted infliximab treatment and 10
      patients interrupted adalimumab treatment (p=0.003), mostly for loss of
      tolerance. Overall, patients preferred adalimumab treatment. All five serious
      adverse events were related to complicated Crohn's disease and occurred in
      patients randomised to adalimumab. Injection site reactions were more frequent
      than infusion reactions (8 vs 1, p=0.01), but only the latter caused cessation of
      further dosing. Anti-TNF serum levels were stable throughout the 1-year period in
      both groups. CONCLUSION: Elective switching from infliximab to adalimumab is
      associated with loss of tolerance and loss of efficacy within 1 year. Adherence
      to the first anti-TNF agent is recommended.

TI  - Common misconceptions about 5-aminosalicylates and thiopurines in inflammatory
      bowel disease.
PG  - 3467-78
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v17.i30.3467 [doi]
AB  - Misconceptions are common in the care of patients with inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD). In this paper, we state the most commonly found misconceptions in clinical
      practice and deal with the use of 5-aminosalicylates and thiopurines, to review
      the related scientific evidence, and make appropriate recommendations. Prevention
      of errors needs knowledge to avoid making such errors through ignorance. However,
      the amount of knowledge is increasing so quickly that one new danger is an
      overabundance of information. IBD is a model of a very complex disease and our
      goal with this review is to summarize the key evidence for the most common daily 
      clinical problems. With regard to the use of 5-aminosalicylates, the best
      practice may to be consider abandoning the use of these drugs in patients with
      small bowel Crohn' s disease. The combined approach with oral plus topical
      5-aminosalicylates should be the first-line therapy in patients with active
      ulcerative colitis; once-daily treatment should be offered as a first choice
      regimen due to its better compliance and higher efficacy. With regard to
      thiopurines, they seem to be as effective in ulcerative colitis as in Crohn' s
      disease. Underdosing of thiopurines is a form of undertreatment. Thiopurines
      should probably be continued indefinitely because their withdrawal is associated 
      with a high risk of relapse. Mercaptopurine is a safe alternative in patients
      with digestive intolerance or hepatotoxicity due to azathioprine. Finally,
      thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) screening cannot substitute for regular
      monitoring because the majority of cases of myelotoxicity are not TPMT-related.

TI  - Strategies for the prevention of postoperative recurrence in Crohn's disease:
      results of a decision analysis.
PG  - 2009-17
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2011.237 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Nearly 70% of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) undergo surgical
      resection, with one-quarter subsequently developing clinical recurrence within 12
      months. Several options exist for the prevention of postoperative recurrence in
      CD, but the comparative cost effectiveness of these competing strategies has not 
      been previously analyzed. METHODS: We developed a decision analytic model
      comprising five strategies--No Treatment, azathioprine (AZA), antibiotics (ABX), 
      upfront infliximab (IFX), and tailored IFX that consisted of no upfront therapy
      with initiation of IFX in patients with severe endoscopic recurrence at 6 months.
      The base-case 1-year clinical recurrence rate was 24% with reduction in
      recurrence by 41%, 77%, and 99% for AZA, ABX, and IFX, respectively. A 1-year
      time horizon was used and sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: At the
      base-case analysis, the ABX (0.82 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)) and AZA
      (0.81 QALYs) arms were more effective and less expensive than the No Treatment
      strategy (0.80 QALYs). The most effective strategy was upfront IFX (0.83 QALYs); 
      however, this was also the most expensive and resulted in a high incremental
      cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) ($777,732/QALY) compared with no treatment. The
      tailored IFX arm was less effective than upfront use but had a more acceptable
      ICER. On increasing the recurrence rate to 78% (high-risk patients), upfront IFX 
      resulted in 0.07 QALYs (ICER $130,580/QALY) gained compared with No Treatment,
      whereas ABX, AZA, and tailored IFX arms dominated No Treatment. CONCLUSION:
      Antibiotics are the most cost-effective option for preventing postoperative
      recurrence, but they have been associated with high rates of intolerance
      precluding widespread use. Upfront IFX is the most efficacious strategy but is
      not cost effective even in high-risk patients. Reserving IFX use for high-risk
      patients with early endoscopic recurrence is more cost effective than upfront use
      in all patients.

LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2011.03.006 [doi]
AB  - We present here two siblings with a history of recurrent oral and genital ulcers,
      neurological and gastrointestinal manifestations. The diagnosis of Behcet's
      disease in a context of familial aggregation was assumed. Facing repeated
      steroid-dependent flares and failure of maintenance therapies with colchicine and
      intolerance to pentoxifilline and disulone, adalimumab was started. Rapid
      response was observed in both patients, with clinical remission after induction
      therapy, which currently sustains under maintenance schedule. This case report
      suggests the effectiveness of adalimumab as first anti-TNFalpha in case of
      steroid-dependent/resistant gastrointestinal BD.

      disease: A single centre experience.
PG  - 324-31
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2011.02.007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Non-response, loss of response, or intolerance to
      anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFalpha) therapy is well recognised in
      Crohn's disease (CD) patients. Data concerning outcomes following the use of a
      second anti-TNFalpha therapy, particularly in patients who do not respond to a
      first anti-TNFalpha agent, are still emerging. The aim of this study was to
      assess response and tolerability to adalimumab following infliximab failure in a 
      single centre cohort of CD patients. METHODS: Data were collected prospectively
      on 44 patients who received adalimumab therapy following infliximab failure.
      Initial response to adalimumab therapy at 6weeks following induction was defined 
      using a two point decrease in the Harvey-Bradshaw Index, with remission at this
      point defined using a Harvey Bradshaw index</=4. Sustained clinical benefit at
      the last point of follow up was determined using a physician's global assessment.
      Corticosteroid-free sustained clinical benefit was also assessed at this point.
      RESULTS: Thirty-four (77%) patients had initial response to adalimumab therapy,
      with 28 (64%) having sustained clinical benefit. Corticosteroid-free sustained
      clinical benefit was achieved in nine (53%) of 17 patients requiring steroids at 
      commencement of adalimumab. Four (44%) of the 9 patients who were primary
      non-responders to infliximab responded to adalimumab. The majority of CD patients
      who failed adalimumab therapy required surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Second-line
      anti-TNFalpha therapy with adalimumab is effective at both inducing remission and
      maintaining response in CD patients who have failed infliximab, regardless of the
      reason for infliximab failure.

TI  - Efficacy of intravenous iron in treating iron deficiency anaemia in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease. Are there predictors of response?
PG  - 245-9
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) iron deficiency anaemia (IDA)
      is a very common disorder. Until recently,oral iron has been the mainstay
      therapy, nevertheless it has been associated with intolerance and noncompliance. 
      Therefore, the goal of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous iron
      in IDA in IBD patients and the secondary aim was to investigate whether other
      potencial factors could influence in the response to the treatment. DESIGN: An
      open-label, prospective, consecutive, single centre study. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 
      We performed our study in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn s
      disease (CD) with severe anaemia or intolerance with oral iron. All of them
      received intravenous sacarose iron and did biochemistry profile with hemoglobin
      (Hb). Moreover, the correlation with other variables was studied: age,sex,
      smoking habit, IBD type, previous surgery and type of surgery and other
      treatments. Response was defined as Hb increase of >/= 2 g/dL or normalization of
      the levels. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients were included into the study, 34(63%)
      with UC y 20 (37%) with CD, 18 (33.3%) men and 36 wo-men (66.6%) and the average 
      was 48 +/- 14 years. The total proportion of responders was 52% (SD +/- 05); 43% 
      of the patients reached Hb >/= 2 g/dl and y 9% of them normalized Hb. Only the
      utilization of 5-ASA was associated with low response to iron treatment (p <
      0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that response to intravenous iron is
      achievable in the majority of patients with IBD and severe IDA or intolerance
      treatment with oral iron. Moreover, the patients with consumption of 5-ASA could 
      had less response to the treatment.

AB  - Celiac disease is an inflammatory enteropathy caused by intolerance to gluten.
      Previous linkage studies in the Dutch, Finnish and Hungarian populations have
      revealed a locus on chromosome 6q21-22 conferring susceptibility to celiac
      disease. This locus has previously been implicated in susceptibility to other
      autoimmune diseases such as Crohn's disease and type 1 diabetes. We performed
      fine mapping on 446 independent individuals with celiac disease and 641 controls 
      of Dutch origin, testing 872 tagging SNPs in a 22 Mb region of chromosome 6. The 
      12 most promising SNPs were followed up in 2071 individuals from 284 Finnish and 
      357 Hungarian celiac disease families to identify risk variants in this region.
      Multiple markers in the region were significantly associated with celiac disease 
      in the Dutch material. Two SNPs, rs9391227 and rs4946111, were significantly
      associated with celiac disease in the Finnish population. The association to
      rs9391227 represents the strongest association signal found in the Finnish (P =
      0.003, OR 0.66) as well as the combined Dutch, Finnish and Hungarian populations 
      (P = 3.6 x 10(-5), OR 0.76). The rs9391227 is situated downstream of the HECT
      domain and ankyrin repeat containing, E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (HACE1) gene 
      and is contained within a region of strong linkage disequilibrium enclosing
      HACE1. Two additional, independent, susceptibility variants in the 6q21-22 region
      were also found in a meta-analysis of the three populations. The 6q21-22 region
      was confirmed as a celiac disease susceptibility locus and harbors multiple
      independent associations, some of which may implicate ubiquitin-pathways in
      celiac disease susceptibility.
