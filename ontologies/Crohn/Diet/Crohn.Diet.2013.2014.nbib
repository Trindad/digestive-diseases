TI  - [Dietary intake in Crohn's disease: results of a prospective comparative study].
PG  - 551-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diet is thought to have an important role in the etiopathogenesis of 
      Crohn's disease. In the other hand, Crohn's disease is frequently associated with
      nutritional deficiencies probably as result of disease activity and poor oral
      intake. AIMS: To investigate the dietary intake in patients with Crohn's disease 
      in comparison with matched population controls and to assess the correlation
      between the results of the dietary enquete, nutritional status and disease
      activity. METHODS: We conducted a prospective case control study in patients with
      Crohn's disease and matched controls. All subjects were evaluated in respect of
      dietary intake (based on "NUTISTAR" logiciel) and nutritional status. RESULTS: We
      studied 23 patients and 23 controls. There was no statistical difference between 
      patients and controls according to the proportion of carbohydrates, fat and
      protein intakes. Energy intakes were significantly lower in patients with Crohn's
      disease (1991 + 678 kcal/j) compared to controls (2537 + 345 kcal/j) (p=0.007) ; 
      and in active disease (1353 + 308 kcal/j) compared to inactive disease patients
      (2481 + 415 kcal/j) (p<0.0001). In Crohn's disease patients, correlation study
      showed that energy intakes were correlated with CDAI (p<0.0001 ; r = - 0.74) and 
      BMI (p=0.03 ; r = 0.45). CONCLUSION: In Crohn's disease, an inadequate dietary
      intake is correlated with nutritional status and disease activity.

TI  - Efficacy of concomitant elemental diet therapy in scheduled infliximab therapy in
      patients with Crohn's disease to prevent loss of response.
PG  - 1382-8
LID - 10.1007/s10620-014-3493-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Loss of response (LOR) to infliximab (IFX) has become an important
      clinical issue for patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Elemental diet (ED)
      therapy has been established as a nutrition therapy for CD in Japan. ED therapy
      can reduce antigen exposure and is both efficacious and safe. AIM: To evaluate
      the efficacy of concomitant ED therapy in maintaining regular IFX infusion in
      patients with CD. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 125 patients with luminal
      CD treated with scheduled IFX maintenance therapy with a regular dosage. Patients
      were classified into two groups: the ED group with intake >/= 900 kcal/day and
      the non-ED group with intake <900 kcal/day. When clinical LOR was detected on the
      basis of disease activity, laboratory parameters, or endoscopic findings, the
      physician discontinued the infusion schedule of IFX. We investigated the efficacy
      of ED therapy for sustaining the scheduled IFX maintenance therapy. RESULTS: With
      the exception of ED intake, no significant differences were found in patient
      characteristics between the ED group and the non-ED group. The ED group was
      significantly superior to the non-ED group (p = 0.049) in sustaining scheduled
      IFX maintenance therapy. It is well known that ED therapy is more effective for
      small bowel lesions than colonic lesions in CD. When comparing ileitis and
      ileocolitis patients with CD, the ED group was significantly superior to the
      non-ED group (p = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant ED therapy is effective in
      maintaining scheduled IFX maintenance therapy in patients with luminal CD in
      order to prevent LOR.

TI  - Quality of life considering patients with chronic inflammatory bowel diseases -
      natural and parenteral nutrition.
PG  - 410-7

AB  - UNLABELLED: One of the elements of treatment considering inflammatory bowel
      diseases is nutritional therapy. The duration of the above-mentioned depends on
      the prevalence of such symptoms as fever, bowel movements, length of the
      functioning gastrointestinal tract, stoma and intestinal fistula presence.
      Nutritional therapy is an essential element of successful treatment alongside
      pharmacological, surgical, and biological therapy, as well as other methods.
      Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis considered as chronic diseases, lead
      towards physical and biopsychosocial disability, being responsible for the
      reduction in the quality of life. The aim of the study was to determine the
      quality of life after surgical procedures in case of patients diagnosed with
      Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, subjected to natural and parenteral
      nutrition. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group comprised 52 patients from the
      Department of Gastroenterology, Military Medical Institute, and Department of
      Surgery and Clinical Nutrition, Clinical Hospital in Warsaw. The study was
      performed between October, 2011 and April, 2012. The World Health Organization
      Quality of Life Instrument - Bref (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire was used to
      deter-mine the patients' quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: A lower quality of life
      was observed in case of patients subjected to parenteral nutrition, poor
      education, disease symptoms exacerbation, in the majority-rural inhabitants. The 
      quality of life does not depend on gender, type of disease, family status, and
      additional medical care.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an idiopathic disease thought to be caused by
      a dysregulated immune response to host intestinal microflora. The role of genetic
      factors is indicated by familial clustering of cases and higher incidence in
      monozygotic twins. An interaction between genetic and environmental factors is
      thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of these disorders. Changes in diet,
      antibiotic use and intestinal colonization have likely contributed to increased
      prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease in the past century. Environmental
      factors or infections are thought to alter the barrier function of the
      epithelium, leading to loss of immune tolerance to intestinal antigens. This loss
      of tolerance activates dendritic cells, triggering their transport to mesenteric 
      lymph nodes, where they promote differentiation of naive T cells to TH-1, TH-2,
      TH-17 cells or T regulatory cells. Production of proinflammatory cytokines and
      chemokines then follows. Circulating effector and regulatory cells enter the
      intestine through a highly selective mechanism that involves interaction with the
      vascular endothelium, diapedesis through the vessel wall and migration to the
      lamina propria. There are several genes implicated in IBD. Mutations in certain
      genes can cause defective down regulation of the innate immune response,
      ineffective clearance of intracellular bacteria and proliferation of both luminal
      and mucosal-adherent commensal bacteria. IBD is a chronic relapsing inflammatory 
      condition that is immune mediated. Results from research in animal models, human 
      genetics, basic science and clinical trials provide evidence that it is
      heterogeneous, characterized by various genetic abnormalities, leading to a
      dysregulated and overly aggressive T cell response to commensal enteric bacteria.
      Different genetic abnormalities can be characterized as causing defects in
      mucosal barrier function, immunoregulation or bacterial clearance. Advances in
      our understanding of the interplay between components of innate and adaptive
      immune response will be central to future progress.

TI  - JAK2 and AMP-kinase inhibition in vitro by food extracts, fractions and purified 
      phytochemicals.
PG  - 305-12
LID - 10.1039/c4fo00626g [doi]
AB  - We have identified a range of food phytochemicals that inhibit Janus Kinase 2
      (JAK2) and Adenosine Monophosphate Kinase (AMPK). A mutated and dysregulated form
      of JAK2, a tyrosine kinase, is associated with several diseases including Crohn's
      disease. Using an in vitro, time-resolved fluorescence (TR-FRET) assay, we tested
      49 different types of food extracts, plus 10 concentrated fractions of increasing
      hydrophobicity from each extract, to find foods containing JAK2 inhibitors. The
      food extracts tested included grains, meat, fish, shellfish, dairy products,
      herbs, mushrooms, hops, fruits and vegetables. Several fruits were potent
      inhibitors of JAK2: blackberry, boysenberry, feijoa, pomegranate, rosehip and
      strawberry, which all contain ellagitannins, known inhibitors of kinases. These
      fruits are in the Rosales and Myrtales plant orders. No other foods gave >1% of
      the maximal JAK2 inhibitory activities of these fruits. AMPK, a sensor and
      regulator of energy metabolism in cells, is a serine-threonine kinase which is
      reported to be activated by various flavonoid phytochemicals. Using a TR-FRET
      assay, we tested various fruit extracts for AMPK activation and inhibition.
      Ellagitannin containing foods scored highly as AMPK inhibitors. Despite several
      reports of AMPK activation in whole cells by phytochemicals, no extracts or pure 
      compounds activated AMPK in our assay.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cheilitis granulomatosa causes persistent idiopathic lip swelling
      and ulceration and it can sometimes be recognized as a unique or early
      manifestation of Crohn's disease. Spontaneous remission is rare and with the lack
      of controlled trials, different therapeutic approaches have been used. Some cases
      have been treated with an exclusion diet in the attempt to rule out diet
      allergens, while the most popular treatments include antibiotics such as
      tetracycline and clofazimine tranilast, benzocaine topical or intralesional
      steroids, and cheiloplasty, with different outcomes. CASE PRESENTATION: We
      describe the case of a 23-year-old Caucasian man, primarily diagnosed with
      cheilitis granulomatosa for a severe lower lip swelling, and then with Crohn's
      disease of the terminal ileum and anus. Treatment of Crohn's disease with an
      anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha agent (infliximab) successfully induced
      remission of both the gastrointestinal disease and the oral lesion. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our recommendation is that physicians should be able to recognize cheilitis
      granulomatosa as a possible marker of a more complex systemic disease and proceed
      first with an accurate physical examination, and further suggest investigations
      of the bowel. In cases of Crohn's disease, a therapy with biological agents can
      be successful.

TI  - Effects of enteral nutritional support on malnourished patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease by subjective global assessment.
PG  - 493-507
LID - 10.5152/tjg.2014.4955 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: To investigate the prevalence of malnutrition in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by subjective global assessment (SGA) and the
      effects of oral nutritional support on the clinical parameters, consumption of
      energy, macronutrients and fiber intake in the Study and Control groups,
      prospectively. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 38 (28 Male; 10 Female)
      hospitalized patients with moderate or severe IBD (13 with Crohn's disease (CD); 
      25 with Ulcerative colitis (UC)) were included. At stage 1, the disease severity,
      clinical symptoms and, signs, food consumption and nutritional status by using
      subjective global assessment (SGA) were recorded. At stage 2, the patients were
      blindly randomized into a Study Group and Controls. In the Study Group, a
      standard enteral product was added into the regulated hospital diets, but for the
      Controls, deficits were regulated by only hospital diets for 3 weeks. the
      independent variables were the group, the disease and its activity, age, Body
      body mass index (BMI), weight loss history, the hospitalization period; the
      dependent variables were SGA, bowel movements, change in nutritional status,
      disease severity, clinical findings, and also consumption of macronutrients.
      RESULTS: Prevalance of malnutrition (SGA-B or SGA-C) for all the patients was
      92.1% at the beginning and 71.1% at the end of study. Improvements in disease
      activity score for the patients with UC were statistically significant in both
      the Study Group and the Controls (p=0.006 for the Study Group and p=0.001 for the
      Controls, respectively). Macronutrients, total and water soluble fiber
      consumption levels improved, with statistically significant differences for all
      the groups. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of malnutrition is a major problem in
      patients with IBD. Not only the regulation of hospital food, but also enteral
      nutritional support, improved their levels of malnutrition, as well as their
      energy, macronutrients, and fiber consumption, and SGA is an easy method for
      nutritional monitoring.

TI  - Multiple micronutrient supplementation transiently ameliorates environmental
      enteropathy in Malawian children aged 12-35 months in a randomized controlled
      clinical trial.
PG  - 2059-65
LID - 10.3945/jn.114.201673 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Environmental enteropathy (EE) is subclinical, diffuse villous
      atrophy characterized by T cell infiltration of the small intestinal mucosa
      associated with nutrient malabsorption and stunting. EE is assessed by the
      lactulose:mannitol (L:M) test, whereby nonmetabolized sugars are ingested and
      quantified in the urine. Multiple micronutrient (MN) deficiency morphologically
      mimics EE, and omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids reduce mucosal
      inflammation in Crohn disease. OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that
      supplementary MNs, with or without fish oil (FO), would improve L:M in rural
      Malawian children aged 1-3 y compared with a control (C) group receiving a
      placebo. METHODS: The MNs and FO provided the Recommended Dietary Intake for 26
      vitamins, minerals, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid. This was a
      3-arm, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, with the
      primary outcomes being the change in L:M (DeltaL:M) after 12 and 24 wk of
      supplementation. Comparisons were made for DeltaL:M after 12 and 24 wk within
      each group by using a Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test, because the data
      are not normally distributed. RESULTS: A total of 230 children had specimens
      adequate for analysis; all had an abnormal baseline L:M, defined as >0.10. After 
      12 wk, children who received MNs + FO had a DeltaL:M [mean (95% CI)] of -0.10
      (-0.04, -0.15; P = 0.001), and children receiving only MNs had DeltaL:M of -0.12 
      (-0.03, -0.21; P = 0.002). After 24 wk, children who received MNs + FO had a
      DeltaL:M of -0.09 (-0.03, -0.15; P = 0.001); children receiving only MNs had a
      DeltaL:M of -0.11 (-0.02, -0.20; P = 0.001), and the C group had DeltaL:M of
      -0.07 (0.02, -0.16); P = 0.002). Linear growth was similar in all groups,
      approximately 4.3 cm over 24 wk. CONCLUSION: Although the effect was modest,
      these data suggest MNs can transiently ameliorate EE in rural African children.
      The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01593033.

TI  - Environmental factors in the relapse and recurrence of inflammatory bowel
      disease: a review of the literature.
PG  - 1396-405
LID - 10.1007/s10620-014-3437-3 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The causes of relapse in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and
      ulcerative colitis (UC) are largely unknown. This paper reviews the
      epidemiological and clinical data on how medications (non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs, estrogens and antibiotics), lifestyle factors (smoking, 
      psychological stress, diet and air pollution) may precipitate clinical relapses
      and recurrence. Potential biological mechanisms include: increasing thrombotic
      tendency, imbalances in prostaglandin synthesis, alterations in the composition
      of gut microbiota, and mucosal damage causing increased permeability. RESULTS:
      The clinical epidemiological data consistently reports positive associations
      between smoking and relapses in CD, and inverse ones with UC. For NSAIDs and
      estrogens, the epidemiological findings are inconsistent, although general
      antibiotic use was associated with a reduced risk of relapse in CD. High levels
      of stress were positively associated with relapse, although psychological
      interventions did not have therapeutic benefits. The limited work on diet has
      reported sulphur-containing foods are positively associated with relapse in UC,
      but there is no work in CD. Ecological data reported positive correlations
      between air pollution levels and IBD hospitalisations. CONCLUSIONS: In the
      future, to clarify this area, more clinical epidemiological work is required
      where detailed drug types and doses, and complete dietary intakes are measured,
      in specific forms of IBD. Such work could provide guidance to both patients and
      doctors to help maintain remission.

      diseases].
PG  - 1251-6
LID - 10.5604/17322693.1127882 [doi]
AB  - In this paper a review of the researches on the role of Escherichia coli strain
      Nissle 1917 (EcN) in gastrointestinal diseases was presented. EcN is a
      non-pathogenic strain of the Enterobacteriaceae family, which has probiotic
      properties. In a number of studies conducted among humans and experimental
      animals the application of EcN in treatment of gastrointestinal diseases was
      observed. Most studies about EcN has been devoted to this organism efficacy in
      ulcerative colitis treatment. Comparable results were obtained, by citied
      authors, in the treatment (sustaining remission) of EcN and mesalazine in
      ulcerative colitis. Moreover, this probiotic therapy, compared to placebo,
      contributes to obtaining a faster remission and improvement of intestinal
      histopathology. The use of EcN in Crohn's disease has not been the subject of as 
      many studies as in the case of ulcerative colitis. Assessing the importance of
      EcN in treatment of other gastrointestinal disorders, authors of the studies
      observed, that in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, who receiving this
      probiotic there was a pain, nausea and bloating reduction. In studies conducted
      among children a positive impact of EcN in prevention and treatment of diarrhea
      was demonstrated. Similar results were obtained in studies conducted in
      experimental animals. Based on the presented review it can be concluded that the 
      strain of Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 is useful in treatment of gastrointestinal
      diseases, especially in treatment of ulcerative colitis. This probiotic may
      constitute a part of treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and diarrhea. The
      effectiveness of this strain in treatment of Crohn's disease is not clearly
      established and further research are require.

      genetic factors linked to Crohn's disease, which eventually leads to an excessive
      mucosal inflammatory response directed against components of normal gut
      microbiota. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in inflammation 
      processes, as well as in transduction of signals from receptors for several
      cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). ROS activate nuclear
      factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) via IkappaB kinase (IKK) through the PI3K/AKT/PTEN
      pathway. Therefore, this pathway is recognized to play a key role in Crohn's
      disease. Loss of function has been demonstrated to occur as an early event in a
      wide variety of diseases. Given this prevalent involvement in a number of
      diseases, the molecular development that modulates this pathway has been the
      subject of several studies. In addition, it has been the focus of extensive
      research and drug discovery activities. A better understanding of the molecular
      assemblies may reveal novel targets for the therapeutic development against
      Crohn's disease.

TI  - Carbohydrate intake in the etiology of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 2013-21
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000168 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diet may have a role in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease.
      In previous studies, the associations between increased intakes of carbohydrates,
      sugar, starch, and inflammatory bowel disease are inconsistent. However, few
      prospective studies have investigated the associations between these
      macronutrients and incident Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC).
      METHODS: A total of 401,326 men and women were recruited between 1991 and 1998.
      At recruitment, dietary intakes of carbohydrate, sugar, and starch were measured 
      using validated food frequency questionnaires. The cohort was monitored
      identifying participants who developed incident CD or UC. Cases were matched with
      4 controls, and odds ratios were calculated for quintiles of total carbohydrate, 
      sugar, and starch intakes adjusted for total energy intake, body mass index, and 
      smoking. RESULTS: One hundred ten participants developed CD, and 244 participants
      developed UC during follow-up. The adjusted odds ratio for the highest versus the
      lowest quintiles of total carbohydrate intake for CD was 0.87, 95% CI = 0.24 to
      3.12 and for UC 1.46, 95% CI = 0.62 to 3.46, with no significant trends across
      quintiles for either (CD, P trend = 0.70; UC, P trend = 0.41). Similarly, no
      associations were observed with intakes of total sugar (CD, P trend = 0.50; UC, P
      trend = 0.71) or starch (CD, P trend = 0.69; UC, P trend = 0.17). CONCLUSIONS:
      The lack of associations with these nutrients is in agreement with many
      case-control studies that have not identified associations with CD or UC. As
      there is biological plausibility for how specific carbohydrates could have an
      etiological role in inflammatory bowel disease, future epidemiological work
      should assess individual carbohydrates, although there does not seem to be a
      macronutrient effect.

AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) is a complex inherited disorder of unknown pathogenesis.
      Recent evidence suggests that CD may involve genetic or environmental factors
      that impair the normal innate immune system's ability to contain bacteria to the 
      lumen. Multiple dietary components may impact on the resident flora, diminish or 
      damage the mucous layer, increase intestinal permeability or increase the ability
      of pathobionts to adhere to epithelial cells or translocate across the epithelial
      barrier. This chapter reviews the possible effects of different dietary
      components present in the Western diet to affect bacterial clearance mechanisms, 
      and offers a hypothetical model for an acquired bacterial clearance defect in CD.

PG  - 115-23
LID - 10.1159/000360716 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disorders (IBD) are characterized by chronic and recurrent
      inflammatory reactions of the intestinal mucosa resulting in progressing
      ulcerating lesions. Research over the past decade clearly identified in patients 
      with Crohn's disease (CD) a marked dysregulation of the intestinal microbiome
      (dysbiosis) as one trigger factor in these inflammatory processes, particularly
      in patients with a high genetic risk. When treating patients with CD, most drugs 
      aim to control the inflammatory process (either by inhibiting inflammatory
      pathways or by reducing the activity of immune cells). Given the importance of
      the disturbed interaction between the microbiota and the host immune system,
      there might be a different therapeutic approach in targeting directly the
      intestinal microflora. There are good data to believe that the use of exclusive
      enteral nutrition (EEN) is one such option. Historically, enteral nutrition (EN) 
      was used as supplemental nutritional therapy in CD patients with planned
      resection surgery. This treatment option showed unexpected and very powerful
      anti-inflammatory effects, and it was rapidly introduced as induction therapy for
      active CD. Several clinical trials and case series confirmed the efficacy of EN
      to induce remission in approximately 80% of patients equaling the potential of
      steroids. It is well established that EN has this strong anti-inflammatory
      potential only when given on an exclusive basis, without any additional food.
      This raises major compliance issues, probably one of the reasons why it is less
      used in adult patients. A recent study demonstrated that EEN has a specific
      effect on the intestinal microbiota, which is markedly different from
      steroid-induced remission, while all patients obtained complete clinical
      remission. These observations give a first basis for the understanding of the
      impact of EEN on dysbiosis in patients with CD.

TI  - Environmental risk factors for inflammatory bowel diseases: a review.
PG  - 290-8
LID - 10.1007/s10620-014-3350-9 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases comprising Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative
      colitis (UC) are chronic immunologically mediated diseases. The key mechanism
      underlying the pathogenesis of these diseases is a dysregulated immune response
      to commensal flora in a genetically susceptible host. Thus intestinal microbial
      dysbiosis, host genetics, and the external environment all play an important role
      in the development of incident disease and in determining subsequent disease
      behavior and outcomes. There are several well-defined or putative environmental
      risk factors including cigarette smoking, appendectomy, diet, stress and
      depression, vitamin D as well as hormonal influence. The effect of some of the
      risk factors appears to differ between CD and UC suggesting that despite shared
      genetic and immunologic mechanisms, distinct pathways of pathogenesis exist.
      There is a growing body of literature identifying risk factors for incident
      disease. There is less rigorous literature defining triggers of relapse, and few 
      controlled clinical trials examining if modification of such risk factors results
      in an improvement in patient outcomes. This is an area of considerable patient,
      physician, and scientific interest, and there is an important unmet need for
      rigorous studies of the external environment in disease pathogenesis and
      subsequent course.

LID - 10.1136/bcr-2013-203018 [doi]
LID - bcr2013203018 [pii]
AB  - A Caucasian woman in her late 20s was referred to the allergy/chest clinic by her
      general practitioner with an 8-month history of recurrent facial angio-oedema.
      She had no history of urticaria or airways symptoms and denied any similar
      problems previously. She had no family history of similar illness and was not on 
      any regular medications. There was no history of atopy. Initially, a clinical
      diagnosis of idiopathic angio-oedema was made. Despite being treated with several
      antihistamines with doses equivalent to 40 mg of cetirizine/day, her problem had 
      failed to respond satisfactorily. Later on, she also revealed history of
      intermittent gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain and diarrhoea.
      Routine investigations were unremarkable. The patient was referred to a
      dermatology clinic and a diagnosis of orofacial granulomatosis was suggested: a
      rare granulomatous disease presenting with lip enlargement, which may or may not 
      be associated with Crohn's disease. A biopsy of the oral mucosa was consistent
      with this diagnosis.

TI  - Serum regenerating islet-derived 3-alpha is a biomarker of mucosal enteropathies.
PG  - 974-81
LID - 10.1111/apt.12920 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical presentation of organic and functional intestinal
      disorders can overlap and clinicians often rely on invasive and time-consuming
      procedures to make a final diagnosis. Regenerating islet-derived 3-alpha
      (Reg3alpha) is detectable in the circulation of patients with intestinal
      graft-versus host disease and patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
      AIM: To determine whether serum Reg3alpha testing is useful for discriminating
      mucosal enteropathies from functional intestinal disorders. METHODS: We
      prospectively included 47 patients with active coeliac disease (ACD), 13 patients
      with refractory coeliac disease (RCD), seven patients with common variable
      immunodeficiency (CVID), 72 patients with active Crohn's disease, 22 patients
      with active ulcerative colitis (UC) and 28 patients with irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS)-related diarrhoea. Sera were also taken from 10 CD patients before and
      after 6-12 months of a gluten-free diet (GFD) and from 14 patients with IBD
      before and after induction therapy with Infliximab (IFX). Sera of 119 healthy
      volunteers were used to determine the cut-off value. Reg3alpha levels were
      measured by a commercial ELISA kit. RESULTS: Levels of Reg3alpha exceeded the
      cut-off value of the assay in 43/47(91%) ACD patients, 13/13(100%) RCD patients, 
      7/7(100%) CVID patients, 65/72(90%) Crohn's disease patients, 17/22(77%) UC
      patients and one patient with IBS(4%). Reg3alpha levels distinguished mucosal
      enteropathies from IBS with a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 96%.
      Reg3alpha levels significantly decreased in CD patients following a GFD and in
      IBD patients after treatment with IFX. CONCLUSION: Reg3alpha is a serum biomarker
      of intestinal damage that, combined with clinical data, identifies patients who
      should undergo invasive tests for diagnosing enteropathies.

TI  - Diet, microbiota, and inflammatory bowel disease: lessons from Japanese foods.
PG  - 409-15
LID - 10.3904/kjim.2014.29.4.409 [doi]
AB  - The incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) including
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease are rapidly increasing in Western countries 
      and in developed Asian countries. Although biologic agents targeting the immune
      system have been effective in patients with IBD, cessation of treatment leads to 
      relapse in the majority of patients, suggesting that intrinsic immune
      dysregulation is an effect, not a cause, of IBD. Dramatic changes in the
      environment, resulting in the dysregulated composition of intestinal microbiota
      or dysbiosis, may be associated with the fundamental causes of IBD. Japan now has
      upgraded water supply and sewerage systems, as well as dietary habits and
      antibiotic overuse that are similar to such features found in developed Western
      countries. The purpose of this review article was to describe the association of 
      diet, particularly Japanese food and microbiota, with IBD.

TI  - Partial enteral nutrition with a Crohn's disease exclusion diet is effective for 
      induction of remission in children and young adults with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1353-60
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000110 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Exclusive enteral nutrition is effective for inducing remission in
      active pediatric Crohn's disease. Partial enteral nutrition (PEN) with free diet 
      is ineffective for inducing remission, suggesting that the mechanism depends on
      exclusion of free diet. We developed an alternative diet based on PEN with
      exclusion of dietary components hypothesized to affect the microbiome or
      intestinal permeability. METHODS: Children and young adults with active disease
      defined as a pediatric Crohn's disease activity index >7.5 or Harvey-Bradshaw
      index >/=4 received a 6-week structured Crohn's disease exclusion diet that
      allowed access to specific foods and restricted exposure to all other foods, and 
      up to 50% of dietary calories from a polymeric formula. Remission, C-reactive
      protien, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were reevaluated at 6 weeks. The
      primary endpoint was remission at 6 weeks defined as Harvey-Bradshaw index </=3
      for all patients and pediatric Crohn's disease activity index <7.5 in children.
      RESULTS: We treated 47 patients (mean age, 16.1 +/- 5.6 yr; 34 children).
      Response and remission were obtained in 37 (78.7%) and 33 (70.2%) patients,
      respectively. Mean pediatric Crohn's disease activity index decreased from 27.7
      +/- 9.4 to 5.4 +/- 8 (P < 0.001), Harvey-Bradshaw index from 6.4 +/- 2.7 to 1.8
      +/- 2.9 (P < 0.001). Remission was obtained in 70% of children and 69% of adults.
      Normalization of previously elevated CRP occurred in 21 of 30 (70%) patients in
      remission. Seven patients used the diet without PEN; 6 of 7 obtained remission.
      CONCLUSIONS: Dietary therapy involving PEN with an exclusion diet seems to lead
      to high remission rates in early mild-to-moderate luminal Crohn's disease in
      children and young adults.

TI  - Dietary clues to the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 389-94
LID - 10.1159/000358143 [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease is a complex inherited disorder of unknown pathogenesis with
      environmental, genetic and microbial factors involved in the development of the
      disease. A remarkable feature of this disease in childhood is the effective
      response to exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) therapy and the need for complete
      exclusion of normal diet required for success (principle of exclusivity). EEN or 
      dietary interventions might act through removal of dietary components, which
      affect microbial composition, decrease a proinflammatory response and promote
      restitution of the epithelial barrier, likewise allowing termination of this
      vicious disease-forming cycle before a critical threshold is reached. Multiple
      traditional and nontraditional dietary components may affect the microbiome,
      mucous layer, intestinal permeability, or adherence and translocation of
      pathobionts. We review the epidemiological data, as well as data from animal
      models and cell lines, and propose a model for pathogenesis we have termed the
      'bacterial penetration cycle', whereby dietary components such as animal fat,
      high sugar intake and gliadin, and consumption of emulsifiers, maltodextrin as
      well as low-fiber diets may be able to cause a localized acquired bacterial
      clearance defect, leading to bacterial adhesion and penetration, and subsequently
      inflammation in the gut.

TI  - Increased IgA glycoprotein-2 specific antibody titres in refractory celiac
      disease.
PG  - 127-33
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: In most cases celiac disease (CD) is successfully treated with
      a gluten-free diet (GFD). However, some patients become refractory to the GFD.
      Refractory CD (RCD) patients have an increased risk for developing enteropathy
      associated T-cell lymphoma and early diagnosis is therefore of importance.
      Currently, RCD diagnosis relies on endoscopy and adequate serological markers are
      lacking. Antibodies against glycoprotein-2 (GP2A) were described in Crohn's
      disease (CrD) and active CD but not in ulcerative colitis (UC), suggesting this
      is a specific marker for small intestinal lesions. METHODS: Sera obtained from
      patients visiting our outpatient clinic for routine serological tests for
      diagnosis and/or follow-up of inflammatory bowel disease (n=78), active CD
      (n=45), GFD (n=34) and RCD (n=15) were analysed for GP2A titres. RESULTS:
      Increased GP2A-IgA levels in CrD and active CD as compared to controls (p<0.001) 
      and lack thereof in UC was confirmed. However, we could not confirm the
      association with small bowel localization within the CrD patient group. Within CD
      patients, we demonstrated a significant decrease of GP2A-IgA titres upon a GFD
      and increased levels in RCD patients as compared to patients on a GFD. Although
      GP2A-IgA was not associated with the degree of villous atrophy, GP2A-IgA levels
      were able to distinguish RCD patients from GFD patients (ROC AUC=0.79, p=0.002). 
      CONCLUSION: Follow-up of GP2A-IgA titres in CD patients on a GFD may help to
      identify patients at risk for developing RCD.

TI  - Variable access to quality nutrition information regarding inflammatory bowel
      disease: a survey of patients and health professionals and objective examination 
      of written information.
PG  - 2501-12
LID - 10.1111/hex.12219 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) report a range of
      nutritional and dietary problems and high-quality written information should be
      available on these. There is little research investigating the availability and
      quality of such information for patients with IBD. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed
      the type and quality of written information on nutrition and diet available to
      patients with IBD and the opinions of patients and health professionals. SETTING 
      AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-two patients with IBD were recruited from a large
      gastroenterology outpatient centre in England. One hundred dietitians from across
      the United Kingdom were also recruited. METHODS: Face-to-face surveys were
      conducted with patients with IBD. Questions regarding the use, format and
      usefulness of dietary information received were probed. Dietitians were surveyed 
      regarding written dietary information used in clinical practice. Samples of
      IBD-specific dietary information used across the UK were objectively assessed
      using two validated tools. MAIN RESULTS: The majority of patients rated written
      information as 'good' or 'very good', with the most useful information relating
      to 'general diet and IBD'. Forty-nine (49%) dietitians reported gaps in written
      information available for patients with IBD. Fifty-three different samples of
      IBD-specific information sheets were returned, with widely variable objective
      quality ratings. Commercially produced written information scored greater than
      locally produced information (BMA tool, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patient access to
      high-quality, written, IBD-specific dietary information is variable. IBD-specific
      written nutrition information needs to be developed in accordance with validated 
      tools to empower patients, encourage self-management and overcome nutritional
      implications of IBD.

AB  - The epidemiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is changing globally.
      Incidence and prevalence may have stabilized in high-incidence areas such as
      North America and Europe but they continue to rise in previously low-incidence
      areas such as Eastern Europe, Asia, and much of the developing world. This
      epidemiological shift likely relates to westernization of lifestyle, changes in
      diet, and improved hygiene as part of socioeconomic development in developing
      countries. In Asia, UC is more prevalent than CD, although the UC:CD ratio is
      narrowing in certain areas. Clinical manifestations of IBD in Asia resemble the
      Western population, but with some differences, including higher prevalence of
      males and ileo-colonic CD, less familial clustering, lower surgical rates and
      extra-intestinal manifestations. These differences may relate to time, genetics
      and environmental factors. Studying the epidemiology of IBD in an area of rapidly
      increasing incidence may lead to discovery of important etiologic factors
      associated with disease development.

TI  - Diet-induced hypoxia responsive element demethylation increases CEACAM6
      expression, favouring Crohn's disease-associated Escherichia coli colonisation.
PG  - 428-37
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2014-306944 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) are abnormally predominant
      on Crohn's disease (CD) ileal mucosa. AIEC strains adhere to enterocytes via
      interaction between type 1 pili and CEACAM6 receptors abnormally expressed on CD 
      ileal mucosa, leading to gut inflammation. We analysed whether epigenetic
      mechanisms are involved in the upregulation of CEACAM6 expression in intestinal
      epithelial cells (IECs). DESIGN: Methylation of CEACAM6 promoter was analysed
      using bisulfite sequencing and site-specific methylation by SnapShot. pCpGfree
      reporter system was used to analyse CEACAM6 promoter activity. Transgenic mice
      expressing human CEACAM6 fed either standard food or a low-methyl diet (LMD) were
      orally challenged with 10(9) AIEC LF82. After 3 days, gut-associated AIEC and
      proinflammatory cytokines were quantified. RESULTS: Analysis of CEACAM6 gene
      promoter revealed potentially methylated dinucleotide CpGs within
      HIF-1-responsive elements (HREs). Methylation levels of CpG within CEACAM6
      promoter were inversely correlated with CEACAM6 expression in IEC expressing
      various levels of CEACAM6. We show the critical role of HRE methylation and
      transcription factor HIF-1 in the regulation of CEACAM6 gene in IEC. This was
      confirmed in transgenic mice expressing human CEACAM6 fed a LMD. LMD-dependent
      HRE demethylation led to abnormal gut expression of CEACAM6, favouring AIEC
      colonisation and subsequent inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: HRE hypomethylation in
      CEACAM6 promoter correlates with high expression in IEC. Our findings suggest
      that abnormal DNA methylation leading to CEACAM6 increased expression and
      AIEC-mediated gut inflammation can be related to changes in nutritional habits,
      such as low intake in methyl donor molecules, leading to abnormal epigenetic
      marks in mouse model mimicking CD susceptibility.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to prospectively evaluate clinical and
      mucosal responses to the specific carbohydrate diet (SCD) in children with Crohn 
      disease (CD). METHODS: Eligible patients with active CD (Pediatric Crohn's
      Disease Activity Index [PCDAI] >/= 15) underwent a patency capsule and, if passed
      intact, capsule endoscopy (CE) was performed. Patients taking SCD were monitored 
      for 52 weeks while maintaining all prescribed medications. Demographic, dietary, 
      and clinical information, PCDAI, Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI), and Lewis score
      (LS) were collected at 0, 12, and 52 weeks. CEs were evaluated by an experienced 
      reader blinded to patient clinical information and timing. RESULTS: Sixteen
      patients were screened; 10 enrolled; and 9 completed the initial 12-week
      trial-receiving 85% of estimated caloric needs before, and 101% on the SCD. HB
      significantly decreased from 3.3 +/- 2.0 to 0.6 +/- 1.3 (P = 0.007) as did PCDAI 
      (21.1 +/- 5.9 to 7.8 +/- 7.1, P = 0.011). LS declined significantly from 2153 +/-
      732 to 960 +/- 433 (P = 0.012). Seven patients continued the SCD up to 52 weeks; 
      HB (0.1 +/- 0.4) and PCDAI (5.4 +/- 5.5) remained improved (P = 0.016 and 0.027
      compared to baseline), with mean LS at 1046 +/- 372 and 2 patients showed
      sustained mucosal healing. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical and mucosal improvements were
      seen in children with CD, who used SCD for 12 and 52 weeks. In addition, CE can
      monitor mucosal improvement in treatment trials for pediatric CD. Further studies
      are critically needed to understand the mechanisms underlying SCD's effectiveness
      in children with CD.

LID - 10.1097/SGA.0000000000000047 [doi]
AB  - Crohn disease is a chronic disorder characterized by episodes of epithelial
      inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract for which there is no cure. The
      prevalence of Crohn disease increased in civilized nations during the time period
      in which food sources were industrialized in those nations. A characteristic of
      industrialized diets is the conspicuous absence of cereal fiber. The purpose of
      this 2-group, randomized, controlled study was to investigate the effects of
      fiber-related dietary instructions specifying wheat bran consumption on
      health-related quality of life and gastrointestinal function in individuals
      diagnosed with Crohn disease, as measured by the Inflammatory Bowel Disease
      Questionnaire and the partial Harvey Bradshaw Index, respectively. Results
      demonstrated that consuming a wheat bran-inclusive diet was feasible and caused
      no adverse effects, and participants consuming whole wheat bran in the diet
      reported improved health-related quality of life (p = .028) and gastrointestinal 
      function (p = .008) compared to the attention control group. The results of a
      secondary aim, to investigate differences in measures of systemic inflammation,
      found no group differences in C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation
      rates. This study suggests that diet modification may be a welcomed complementary
      therapy for individuals suffering gastrointestinal disruption associated with
      Crohn disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Maintaining a gluten-free diet (GFD) without an underlying diagnosis 
      of celiac disease has enjoyed widespread acceptance in the Unites States.
      METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study using a GFD questionnaire in 1647
      patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) participating in the CCFA
      Partners longitudinal Internet-based cohort. RESULTS: A diagnosis of celiac
      disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity were reported by 10 (0.6%) and 81
      (4.9%) respondents, respectively. Three hundred fourteen (19.1%) participants
      reported having previously tried a GFD and 135 (8.2%) reported current use of
      GFD. Overall 65.6% of all patients, who attempted a GFD, described an improvement
      of their gastrointestinal symptoms and 38.3% reported fewer or less severe IBD
      flares. In patients currently attempting a GFD, excellent adherence was
      associated with significant improvement of fatigue (P < 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: In
      this large group of patients with IBD, a substantial number had attempted a GFD, 
      of whom the majority had some form of improvement in gastrointestinal symptoms.
      Testing a GFD in clinical practice in patients with significant intestinal
      symptoms, which are not solely explained by the degree of intestinal
      inflammation, has the potential to be a safe and highly efficient therapeutic
      approach. Further prospective studies into mechanisms of gluten sensitivity in
      IBD are warranted.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Osteomalacia is a metabolic bone disorder characterized by impaired
      mineralization of the bone matrix. Vitamin D deficiency due to malabsorption
      syndromes may cause osteomalacia. This is a case of a patient with a 6-year
      history of seronegative spondyloarthropathy associated with Crohn's disease who
      was admitted to our outpatient clinic with symptoms of osteomalacia.
      INTRODUCTION: Osteomalacia is a metabolic bone disease characterized by an
      impaired mineralization of the bone matrix, frequently caused by disorders in
      vitamin D or phosphate metabolism. Vitamin D deficiency due to malabsorption
      syndromes (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, and
      jejuno-ileal bypass for obesity) may cause osteomalacia. CASE REPORT: A
      43-year-old male presented with fatigue, low back pain, and morning stiffness. He
      had a 6-year history of seronegative spondyloarthropathy associated with Crohn's 
      disease. Laboratory findings revealed low serum calcium, low 25-hydroxy vitamin
      D3, normal phosphorus, elevated parathyroid hormone, and alkaline phosphatase
      levels. Radiographs revealed grade IV sacroiliitis and Looser zones. He was
      diagnosed with osteomalacia due to the malabsorption of vitamin D. His symptoms
      and signs were relieved with supplements of vitamin D and calcium. CONCLUSIONS:
      Osteomalacia should be considered in differential diagnosis when assessing low
      back pain in the patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Vitamin D
      deficiency should be treated with vitamin D supplementation in patients with
      Crohn's disease to prevent osteomalacia.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Clinical management of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD),
      new treatment modalities and the potential impact of personalised medicine remain
      topics of intense interest as our understanding of the pathophysiology of IBD
      expands. METHODS: Potential future strategies for IBD management are discussed,
      based on recent preclinical and clinical research. RESULTS: A top-down approach
      to medical therapy is increasingly being adopted for patients with risk factors
      for severe inflammation or an unfavourable disease course in an attempt to halt
      the inflammatory process as early as possible, prevent complications and induce
      mucosal healing. In the future, biological therapies for IBD are likely to be
      used more selectively based on personalised benefit/risk assessment, determined
      through reliable biomarkers and tissue signatures, and will probably be optimised
      throughout the course of treatment. Biologics with different mechanisms of action
      will be available; when one drug fails, patients will be able to switch to
      another and even combination biologics may become a reality. The role of
      biotherapeutic products that are similar to currently licensed biologics in terms
      of quality, safety and efficacy - i.e. biosimilars - is at an early stage and
      requires further experience. Other therapeutic strategies may involve
      manipulation of the microbiome using antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, diet
      and combinations of all these approaches. Faecal microbiota transplantation is
      also a potential option in IBD although controlled data are lacking. CONCLUSIONS:
      The future of classifying, prognosticating and managing IBD involves an
      outcomes-based approach to identify biomarkers reflecting various biological
      processes that can be matched with clinically important endpoints.

      colitis.
PG  - 1110-9
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000020 [doi]
AB  - Inadequate dietary intake of the essential trace element selenium (Se) is thought
      to be a risk factor for several chronic diseases associated with oxidative stress
      and inflammation. Biological actions of Se occur through low-molecular weight
      metabolites and through selenoproteins. Several key selenoproteins including
      glutathione peroxidases; selenoproteins M, P, and S; and selenium-binding protein
      1 have been detected in the intestine. Interestingly, Se and antioxidant
      selenoproteins are known to modulate differentiation and function of immune cells
      and contribute to avoid excessive immune responses. This review discusses the
      role of Se and intestinal selenoproteins in inflammatory bowel diseases, based on
      data from human, animal, and in vitro studies. In humans, Se deficiency is
      commonly observed in patients with Crohn's disease. In animal models of
      experimental colitis, the Se status was negatively correlated with the severity
      of the disease. While the cause-effect relationship of these observations remains
      to be clarified, the beneficial outcome of dietary Se supplementation and an
      optimization of selenoprotein biosynthesis in murine inflammatory bowel disease
      models have led to investigations of targets and actions of Se in the
      gastrointestinal tract. The Se status affects gene expression, signaling
      pathways, and cellular functions in the small and large intestine as well as the 
      gut microbiome composition. This data, particularly from animal experiments, hold
      promise that adequate dietary Se supply may counteract chronic intestinal
      inflammation in humans.

AB  - Our understanding of bile metabolism and the molecular effects of bile acids has 
      expanded in recent years. Bile acids, which are classically recognized for their 
      involvement in dietary lipid absorption, are now known to be involved in many
      aspects of energy metabolism and disease processes in humans. Cholelithiasis, a
      consequence of altered bile metabolism, affects a significant number of American 
      adults. An understanding of the disease process, risk factors, and complications 
      of gallbladder disease is necessary for the development of novel targeted
      treatments and prophylactic therapies against the development of gallstones.

TI  - Impact of Disease Activity on Resting Energy Expenditure and Body Composition in 
      Adult Crohn's Disease: A Prospective Longitudinal Assessment.
PG  - 713-8
LID - 10.1177/0148607114528360 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is controversy about nutrition status and calorie needs during 
      phases of active versus inactive adult Crohn's disease (CD). Results have been
      reported in cross-sectional studies, but longitudinal data are unavailable. Our
      aim was to explore whether disease activity had an impact on resting energy
      expenditure (REE) and body composition in adult patients with CD. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Adult patients were studied on 2 occasions with active and inactive CD. 
      REE was measured by indirect calorimetry. Body composition was estimated from
      bioelectrical impedance analysis. Disease activity was measured using the Crohn's
      Disease Activity Index (CDAI). Regression analyses of REE with CDAI score,
      C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were also performed.
      RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were included. Patients with active CD had
      increased REE/body weight compared with patients with inactive disease (28.8 +/- 
      5.4 vs 25.9 +/- 4.3 kcal/kg, P < .001). Disease behavior and location, but not
      sex, had an impact on REE/body weight. Body mass index was lower in active
      disease than in remission (17.4 +/- 3.0 vs 18.1 +/- 2.6 kg/m(2), P = .010). Body 
      composition was not affected by disease behavior or location. CONCLUSION:
      Patients with remission had a better nutrition status and decreased REE compared 
      with those with active CD. REE could also be affected by disease location and
      behavior.

TI  - Decline in presumptively protective gut bacterial species and metabolites are
      paradoxically associated with disease improvement in pediatric Crohn's disease
      during enteral nutrition.
PG  - 861-71
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000023 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The gut microbiota is implicated in the pathogenesis of Crohn's
      disease (CD). Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is a successful treatment, but
      its mode of action remains unknown. This study assessed serial changes in the
      fecal microbiota milieu during EEN. METHODS: Five fecal samples were collected
      from CD children: 4 during EEN (start, 15, 30, end EEN approximately 60 days) and
      the fifth on habitual diet. Two samples were collected from healthy control
      subjects. Fecal pH, bacterial metabolites, global microbial diversity abundance, 
      composition stability, and quantitative changes of total and 7 major bacterial
      groups previously implicated in CD were measured. RESULTS: Overall, 68 samples
      were from 15 CD children and 40 from 21 control subjects. Fecal pH and total
      sulfide increased and butyric acid decreased during EEN (all P < 0.05). Global
      bacterial diversity abundance decreased (P < 0.05); a higher degree of microbiota
      composition stability was seen in control subjects than in CD children during EEN
      (at P </= 0.008). Faecalibacterium prausnitzii spp concentration significantly
      decreased after 30 days on EEN (P < 0.05). In patients who responded to EEN, the 
      magnitude of the observed changes was greater and the concentration of
      Bacteroides/Prevotella group decreased (P < 0.05). All these changes reverted to 
      pretreatment levels on free diet, and EEN microbiota diversity increased when the
      children returned to their free diet. CONCLUSIONS: EEN impacts on gut microbiota 
      composition and changes fecal metabolic activity. It is difficult to infer a
      causative association between such changes and disease improvement, but the
      results do challenge the current perception of a protective role for F.
      prausnitzii in CD.

TI  - Association between high dietary intake of the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid
      docosahexaenoic acid and reduced risk of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 834-42
LID - 10.1111/apt.12670 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are plausible mechanisms for how dietary docosahexaenoic acid
      (DHA), an n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, could prevent Crohn's disease (CD).
      AIM: To conduct a prospective study to investigate the association between
      increased intake of DHA and risk of CD. METHODS: Overall, 229 702 participants
      were recruited from nine European centres between 1991 and 1998. At recruitment, 
      dietary intakes of DHA and fatty acids were measured using validated food
      frequency questionnaires. The cohort was monitored through to June 2004 to
      identify participants who developed incident CD. In a nested case-control
      analysis, each case was matched with four controls; odds ratios (ORs) were
      calculated for quintiles of DHA intake, adjusted for total energy intake,
      smoking, other dietary fatty acids, dietary vitamin D and body mass index.
      RESULTS: Seventy-three participants developed incident CD. All higher quintiles
      of DHA intake were inversely associated with development of CD; the highest
      quintile had the greatest effect size (OR = 0.07; 95% CI = 0.02-0.81). The OR
      trend across quintiles of DHA was 0.54 (95% CI = 0.30-0.99, Ptrend = 0.04).
      Including BMI in the multivariate analysis, due to its correlation with dietary
      fat showed similar associations. There were no associations with the other
      dietary fatty acids studied. CONCLUSION: There were inverse associations, with a 
      biological gradient between increasing dietary docosahexaenoic acid intakes and
      incident Crohn's disease. Further studies in other populations should measure
      docosahexaenoic acid to determine if the association is consistent and the
      hypothesis tested in randomised controlled trials of purely docosahexaenoic acid 
      supplementation.

TI  - Omega 3 fatty acids (fish oil) for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease.
PG  - CD006320
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD006320.pub4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The anti-inflammatory effects of n-3 (omega-3 fatty acids, fish oil) 
      have been suggested to be beneficial in chronic inflammatory disorders such as
      inflammatory bowel disease. This review is an update of a previously published
      Cochrane review. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the efficacy and safety of 
      n-3 for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease (CD). SEARCH METHODS: The
      following databases were searched from inception to November 2013 without
      language restriction: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, HealthSTAR, PubMed, and ACP
      journal club. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCT) of
      n-3 for maintenance of remission in CD were included. Studies must have enrolled 
      patients of any age group, who were in remission at the time of recruitment, and 
      were followed for at least six months. The intervention must have been fish oil
      or n-3 given in pre-defined dosage. Co-interventions were allowed only if they
      were balanced between the study groups. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The primary
      outcome was the relapse rate and secondary outcomes included change in disease
      activity scores, time to first relapse and adverse events. Two independent
      investigators reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted the data and assessed
      study quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The overall quality of the
      evidence supporting the primary and selected secondary outcomes was reassessed
      for the current update using the GRADE system. We used the RevMan software for
      analyses. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence
      interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and the hazard ratio and 95% CI for
      time-to-event outcomes. Random-effects or fixed-effect models were used according
      to degree of heterogeneity and sensitivity analyses were performed in an attempt 
      to explore possible sources of heterogeneity. MAIN RESULTS: Six studies with a
      total of 1039 patients were eligible for inclusion. The two largest studies were 
      rated as low risk of bias for all assessed items. Four studies were rated as
      unclear risk of bias for randomization and allocation concealment. Two studies
      were rated as high risk of bias for incomplete outcome data and selective
      reporting. There was a marginal significant benefit of n-3 therapy for
      maintenance of remission. Thirty-nine per cent of patients in the n-3 group
      relapsed at 12 months compared to 47% of placebo patients (6 studies, 1039
      patients; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.98). A GRADE analysis rated the overall
      quality of the evidence for the primary outcome (i.e. relapse) as very low due to
      unexplained heterogeneity (I2 = 58%), publication bias, and a high or unknown
      risk of bias in four studies in the pooled analysis. When two large studies at
      low risk of bias were considered the benefit was no longer statistically
      significant. Thirty-seven per cent of patients in the n-3 group relapsed at 12
      months compared to 42% of placebo patients (2 studies, 738 patients; RR 0.88, 95%
      CI 0.74 to 1.05). No significant heterogeneity was identified for this pooled
      analysis ( I2 = 0%). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the
      evidence supporting this outcome was moderate due to sparse data (294 events). No
      serious adverse events were recorded in any of the studies but in a pooled
      analyses there was a significantly higher rate of diarrhea (4 studies, 862
      patients; RR 1.36 95% CI 1.01 to 1.84) and upper gastrointestinal tract symptoms 
      (5 studies, 999 patients; RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.18) in the n-3 treatment
      group. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from two large high quality studies
      suggests that omega 3 fatty acids are probably ineffective for maintenance of
      remission in CD. Omega 3 fatty acids appear to be safe although they may cause
      diarrhea and upper gastrointestinal tract symptoms.

AB  - The evolving understanding of the role of the microbiome and environmental
      factors in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease makes diet an
      interesting and potentially powerful tool in the treatment of disease. However,
      at this time, evidence is limited but anecdotal reports of success abound. There 
      is a bewildering array of new diets being tried by patients in an attempt to
      control diseases. This review attempts to summarize the most common diets for the
      treating physician.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is one of the therapeutic
      strategies used to induce remission in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). Although
      its use is recommended in clinical practice guidelines and consensus documents,
      the frequency of this practice in Spain is unknown. METHODS: A 70-item
      questionnaire ( PRESENT: PREScription of Enteral Nutrition in pediaTric Crohn's
      disease in Spain) was drafted and distributed through the SEGHNP (Spanish Society
      for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition) e-mail list. RESULTS:
      We received information from 51 Pediatric Gastroenterology Units. Of the 287
      patients newly diagnosed with CD in 2011-2012 at these centres (139 in 2011, 148 
      in 2012), 182 (63%) received EEN (58% in 2011 and 68% in 2012). 26% of the
      patients who received EEN in the period studied (64/246) did so during relapses. 
      All the physicians (100%) who responded to the questionnaire believe that EEN is 
      effective in inducing clinical remission in mild to moderate CD. However, 24.5%
      of respondents never use EEN during relapses. The enteral formulas used most
      often used were polymeric formulas specific for CD (70.6%) and the preferred
      administration route was oral, with 60.8% using flavouring and 9.3% allowing a
      variable percentage of calories in the form of other foods. 65% use 5-ASA
      together with EEN, 69% use antibiotics and 95% immunomodulators (thiopurines).
      The duration of EEN tends to be 8 weeks (47.1%), and transition to regular diet
      was achieved sequentially over a variable period of time. Regarding barriers and 
      limiting factors for the use of EEN, those most frequently reported include lack 
      of acceptance by the patient and/or family (71%), lack of time and/or ancillary
      staff (69%) and difficulty in convincing the patient and/or family of the
      suitability of treatment (43%). CONCLUSIONS: EEN use rates are similar to those
      of other European questionnaires. Tools that facilitate acceptance by the patient
      and family are needed. Increasing the time dedicated to this therapeutic modality
      is likewise important. Given the disparity of criteria for indicating treatment
      with EEN, it would be useful to have widely accepted clinical practice guidelines
      or protocols that facilitate the decision to use it.

AB  - BACKGROUND: "Fast-track" management (FT) challenges traditional postoperative
      tenets in order to minimize discomfort and optimize inpatient care. We examined
      the outcomes of consecutively performed laparoscopic-assisted ileocecectomy for
      Crohn's disease (CD), with particular focus on FT's effects in patients with
      underlying bowel inflammation. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all patients 
      undergoing isolated laparoscopic-assisted ileocecectomy for CD at our institution
      between 12/2000 and 12/2010, excluding patients with multiple areas of surgical
      CD, bladder involvement, or age >18years. RESULTS: Seventy-one patients aged
      8-18years underwent isolated laparoscopic-assisted ileocecectomy for CD, of which
      45 met FT criteria. Individual practice patterns primarily determined which
      patients were FT-managed. FT management led to decreased length of stay (LOS),
      time to first stool, time to full diet, and intravenous narcotic use. No
      significant difference in complications or disease progression was observed
      between the two groups during 2-year follow up. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest 
      that FT is safe and effective in patients with CD. In a chronically ill
      population, counseling patients and families to expect early discharge is
      critical to the success of this strategy. Despite CD-related GI pathology, FT
      patients realized benefits in terms of LOS, time to bowel function, and narcotic 
      use without any increase in complications.

TI  - Detailed assessment of nutritional status and eating patterns in children with

PG  - 700-6
LID - 10.1038/ejcn.2013.286 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: In the era of modern multidisciplinary clinical
      management, very little is known about the prevalence and presentation of
      malnutrition in children with gastrointestinal disorders (GastroD) particularly
      employing composite, global measures of nutritional status. SUBJECTS/METHODS:
      Anthropometry, body composition, dietary intake, eating habits and grip strength 
      were assessed with bedside methods in 168 patients from outpatient
      gastroenterology clinics (n, median (IQR) years; Crohn's disease (CD): n=53, 14.2
      (11.6:15.4); ulcerative colitis (UC): n=27, 12.2 (10.7:14.2); coeliac disease:
      n=31, 9.3 (7.5:13.6); other GastroD: n=57, 9.8 (7.2:13.8)) and compared with 62
      contemporary healthy controls (n, median (IQR): 9.8 (6.9:13.8)) and the results
      of the recent UK, National Diet and Nutritional Survey (NDNS). RESULTS: Children 
      with CD had lower BMI z-scores than controls (median (IQR): -0.3 (-0.9:0.4) vs
      0.3 (-0.6:1.4); P=0.02) but only 2% were classified as thin (BMI z-score <-2
      s.d.). The prevalence of obesity in children with UC was 19%, 6% in CD, 11% in
      children with other GastroD and 15% in controls. No difference was found in grip 
      strength measurement between groups. Except for CD children, the proportion of
      patients with suboptimal micronutrient intake was similar to that of controls and
      the cohort of children from the latest NDNS. A higher proportion of children with
      CD had suboptimal intake for riboflavin, vitamin B6 and calcium and consumed
      significantly more meat products, juices (including carbonated drinks),
      spreads/jams and crisps and savoury snacks and significantly fewer portions of
      dairy, fish, fruits and vegetables compared with healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS:
      GastroD affect children's body composition, growth, strength, dietary intake and 
      eating habits, particularly CD, but to a lesser extent than expected.

AB  - Increased dietary ratios of omega6/omega3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have been
      implicated in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD), but epidemiologic data
      are limited. We investigated whether variants of genes that control
      polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism (CYP4F3, FADS1, and FADS2), along with the 
      dietary ratio of omega6/omega3, confers susceptibility to CD. Based on data from 
      182 children newly diagnosed with CD and 250 controls, we found that children who
      consumed a higher dietary ratio of omega6/omega3 were susceptible for CD if they 
      were also carriers of specific variants of CYP4F3 and FADS2 genes. Our findings
      implicate diet-gene interactions in the pathogenesis of CD.

TI  - Standard versus rapid food reintroduction after exclusive enteral nutritional
      therapy in paediatric Crohn's disease.
PG  - 276-81
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0000000000000027 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In paediatric Crohn's disease (PCD), 6-8 weeks of exclusive enteral
      nutrition (EEN) is effective in 60-80% cases. EEN is followed by gradual food
      reintroduction over variable (1-5 weeks) periods. Currently, there is no
      recommended duration or method for food reintroduction. The rationale for slow
      reintroduction is unclear and may be because of concerns about food intolerance
      or to maintain longer remission. AIMS: The aims of this study were as follows: to
      compare relapse rates following standard and rapid reintroduction of food after
      EEN in PCD and to determine the duration of maintained remission in two groups of
      PCD patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two groups with PCD were compared: group A
      received standard food reintroduction over 5 weeks and group B received rapid
      reintroduction over 3 days. Data were collected over two consecutive time
      periods: group A (2005-2009) and group B (2009-2011). Only patients with a new
      diagnosis of PCD were included. Those with strictures and those on steroids or
      biologicals during EEN were excluded. The minimum duration of follow-up was 1
      year. RESULTS: Group A included 20 patients and group B included 19 patients. In 
      these groups, EEN led to clinical remission in 80% of the patients in group A and
      in 76% of the patients in group B. At 6 months, one-third of the patients from
      each group had developed relapse and a year after EEN, 50% of the patients in
      group A and 47% of the patients in group B developed relapse. Time to first
      relapse was 188 days (group A) and 136 days (group B). None of these results were
      statistically significant. CONCLUSION: In PCD, rapid food reintroduction
      following 6-week EEN is safe and equally effective as longer food reintroduction.
      We propose that a rapid food reintroduction schedule be recommended as the most
      tolerable approach for food reintroduction. Relapse rate and duration of
      remission are uninfluenced by the type of food reintroduction.

TI  - Candidate genes involved in beneficial or adverse responses to commonly eaten
      brassica vegetables in a New Zealand Crohn's disease cohort.
PG  - 5046-64
LID - 10.3390/nu5125046 [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) is one of the two manifestations of inflammatory bowel
      disease. Particular foods are thought with CD to exacerbate their illness.
      Vegetables, especially Brassicaceae, are often shunned by people with CD because 
      of the negative effects they are alleged to have on their symptoms. Brassicaceae 
      supply key nutrients which are necessary to meet recommended daily intakes. We
      sought to identify the candidate genes involved in the beneficial or adverse
      effects of Brassicaceae most commonly eaten, as reported by the New Zealand
      adults from the "Genes and Diet in Inflammatory Bowel disease Study" based in
      Auckland. An analysis of associations between the single nucleotide polymorphisms
      (SNPs) and the beneficial or adverse effects of the ten most commonly eaten
      Brassicaceae was carried out. A total of 37 SNPs were significantly associated
      with beneficial effects (p = 0.00097 to 0.0497) and 64 SNPs were identified with 
      adverse effects (p = 0.0000751 to 0.049). After correcting for multiple testing, 
      rs7515322 (DIO1) and rs9469220 (HLA) remained significant. Our findings show that
      the tolerance of some varieties of Brassicaceae may be shown by analysis of a
      person's genotype.

PG  - 255-6

AB  - Folate deficiency in patients with Crohn's disease may be due to a combination of
      factors: poor diet, malabsorption, increased requirements due to inflammation of 
      the mucosa, and the taking of certain drugs as sulfasalazine and methotrexate. A 
      significant proportion of patients with Crohn's disease suffer from folate
      deficiency, suggesting that regular screening should be performed.

TI  - British Dietetic Association evidence-based guidelines for the dietary management
      of Crohn's disease in adults.
PG  - 207-18
LID - 10.1111/jhn.12176 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is a debilitating chronic inflammatory bowel disease.
      Appropriate use of diet and nutritional therapy is integral to the overall
      management strategy of Crohn's disease. The aim was to develop evidence-based
      guidelines on the dietary management of Crohn's disease in adults. METHODS:
      Questions relating to the dietary management of Crohn's disease were developed.
      These included the roles of enteral nutrition to induce remission, food
      re-introduction diets to structure food re-introduction and maintain remission,
      and dietary management of stricturing disease, as well as whether probiotics or
      prebiotics induce or maintain remission. A comprehensive literature search was
      conducted and relevant studies from January 1985 to November 2009 were identified
      using the electronic database search engines CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EMBASE,
      MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Science. Evidence statements, recommendations,
      practical considerations and research recommendations were developed. RESULTS:
      Fifteen research papers were critically appraised and the evidence formed the
      basis of these guidelines. Although corticosteroids appear to be more effective, 
      enteral nutrition (elemental or non-elemental) can be offered as an alternative
      option to induce disease remission. After a course of enteral nutrition, food
      re-introduction diets may be useful to structure food re-introduction and help
      maintain disease remission. Dietary fibre is contraindicated in the presence of
      strictures as a result of the risk of mechanical obstruction. The use of
      probiotics and prebiotics is not currently supported. CONCLUSIONS: As an
      alternative to corticosteroids, evidence supports enteral nutrition to induce
      disease remission. Food re-introduction diets provide structure to food
      re-introduction and help maintain disease remission. These guidelines aim to
      reduce variation in clinical practice.

      inflammation in Crohn's disease patients.
PG  - 24
LID - 10.1186/1479-7364-7-24 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammation is an essential immune response; however, chronic
      inflammation results in disease including Crohn's disease. Therefore, reducing
      the inflammation can yield a significant health benefit, and one way to achieve
      this is through diet. We developed a Mediterranean-inspired anti-inflammatory
      diet and used this diet in a 6-week intervention in a Crohn's disease population.
      We examined changes in inflammation and also in the gut microbiota. We compared
      the results of established biomarkers, C-reactive protein and the micronuclei
      assay, of inflammation with results from a transcriptomic approach. RESULTS: Data
      showed that being on our diet for 6 weeks was able to reduce the established
      biomarkers of inflammation. However, using transcriptomics, we observed
      significant changes in gene expression. Although no single gene stood out, the
      cumulative effect of small changes in many genes combined to have a beneficial
      effect. Data also showed that our diet resulted in a trend of normalising the
      microbiota. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that our Mediterranean-inspired diet
      appeared to benefit the health of people with Crohn's disease. Our participants
      showed a trend for reduced markers of inflammation and normalising of the
      microbiota. The significant changes in gene expression after 6 weeks highlighted 
      the increased sensitivity of using transcriptomics when compared to the
      established biomarkers and open up a new era of dietary intervention studies.

TI  - Crohn`s disease. Increasing trend in Saudi Arabia.
PG  - 1105-13
AB  - We attempted, through systematic review to explore the epidemiology and risk
      factors of Crohn's disease (CD) with special attention to the Kingdom of Saudi
      Arabia (KSA). We selected articles that contained population-based,
      epidemiological, and clinical character studies of CD. We collected data
      concerned with the prevalence, demographic features, and the possible etiology of
      CD that might explain its emergence in KSA. The prevalence of CD in Western
      countries ranged between 11-43/100,000 with flawless evidence of CD prevalence
      emerging in previously low incidence areas like Asia. Prevalence in KSA has
      markedly increased over the last 3 decades. Combined ileal and colonic
      involvement was the most frequently affected site. Diet, smoking, drugs, and
      westernization of life are assumed to contribute to the pathogenesis. There is
      convincing evidence of CD emerging in Asia, including KSA. Westernization of
      lifestyle and smoking is probably the major contributing factors. Genetic studies
      are warranted.

TI  - High residential sun exposure is associated with a low risk of incident Crohn's
      disease in the prospective E3N cohort.
PG  - 75-81
LID - 10.1097/01.MIB.0000436275.12131.4f [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin D insufficiency has been suggested to be associated with high
      risk of Crohn's disease (CD). In France, where food fortification is limited, the
      major source of vitamin D is through sun exposure. The aim of this work was to
      analyze the relationship between residential sun exposure and the risk of
      incident CD or ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: The E3N cohort consists of women
      living in France, aged 40 to 65 years and free of major diseases at inclusion in 
      1990. Among the 91,870 women included in the study, we identified 123 incident
      cases (45 CD, 71 UC, and 7 indeterminate colitis). To assess residential sun
      exposure, we used a database containing mean daily ultraviolet radiation (UVR)
      dose for each French county. The relationship between residential sun exposure
      and risk of incident inflammatory bowel diseases was explored using Cox models.
      RESULTS: Higher levels of residential sun exposure were associated with a
      significant decreased risk of CD (hazard ratio [HR] for the third versus the
      first tertile of UVR dose, 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.23-1.01; P for
      trend = 0.04), but not of UC (HR, 1.21; CI, 0.61-2.11). In women with available
      data on dietary vitamin D intake, we observed a lower risk of CD with higher
      residential UVR (HR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.11-0.80; P for trend = 0.01). Dietary
      vitamin D intake was neither associated with the risk of CD (HR, 0.41; 95% CI,
      0.14-1.24; P for trend = 0.14) nor UC (HR, 1.61; CI, 0.61-4.23). CONCLUSIONS: In 
      this prospective cohort of women, high residential sunlight exposure was
      associated with decreased incidence of CD, but not UC.

TI  - Exogenous pigment in Peyer patches of children suspected of having IBD.
PG  - 477-80
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000221 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The base of human Peyer patches of the terminal ileum has been noted 
      to contain black granular pigment deposits, composed of titanium dioxide and
      aluminosilicate, which are food additives typically present in a Western diet,
      and pharmaceuticals. In the present study, we investigated the distribution of
      exogenous pigment throughout the gastrointestinal tract of children suspected of 
      having inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the correlation between their age and
      the presence and amount of pigment in Peyer patches, and its relation to
      pediatric IBD. METHODS: Biopsies (upper and lower gastrointestinal tract) from
      children suspected of having IBD who underwent endoscopy, were reassessed by a
      blinded, expert pathologist. The amount of pigment in biopsies was scored using a
      semiquantitative scale (range 0 to +++). RESULTS: A total of 151 children were
      included: 62 with Crohn disease (CD), 26 with ulcerative colitis, and 63 with
      non-IBD. In 63 children (42%), deposits of black pigment were found only in
      biopsies from the terminal ileum, located in Peyer patches. A significant
      correlation was found between increasing age and the amount of pigment (P =
      0.004). Pigment deposits were found significantly less in the patients with CD
      compared with those in patients with ulcerative colitis and those with non-IBD
      (26% vs 62% and 49%, P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: These results provide support for
      the hypothesis that the amount of pigment, only present in Peyer patches in the
      terminal ileum, becomes denser with increasing age. Absence of pigment in Peyer
      patches in a higher number of patients with CD suggests that microparticles may
      have become involved in the inflammatory process, possibly because of disrupted
      autophagy.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is commonly believed to increase the risk of
      bone mineral loss, leading to osteoporosis and an increased risk of disabling
      fractures. In this narrative review, we will presenting a summary of the
      published medical literature in regards to the relationship between IBD and the
      development of osteoporosis, bone mineral loss, and fractures. We will explore
      the epidemiology of metabolic bone disease in IBD, focusing on the prevalence and
      both the general and IBD-specific risk factors for the development of
      osteoporosis and of fracture in persons with IBD. We will also examine the role
      of the inflammatory process in IBD promoting excessive bone mineral loss, as well
      as the role that low body mass, corticosteroid use, diet, and nutrient
      malabsorption play in contributing to bone disease. Last, we will discuss our
      recommendation for: screening for osteoporosis in IBD patients, the use of
      preventative strategies, and therapeutic interventions for treating osteoporosis 
      in persons with IBD.

TI  - Review article: the association of diet with onset and relapse in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1172-87
LID - 10.1111/apt.12501 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of diet in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is supported by 
      migration studies and increasing incidences in line with Westernisation. AIM: To 
      give a complete overview of studies associating habitual diet with the onset or
      relapses in ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: A
      structured search in Pubmed, the Cochrane Library and EMBASE was performed using 
      defined key words, including only full text papers in English language. RESULTS: 
      Forty-one studies were identified, investigating onset (n = 35), relapses (n = 5)
      or both (n = 1). Several studies reported high intake of sugar or
      sugar-containing foods (n = 7 UC, n = 12 CD), and low intake of fruits and/or
      vegetables (n = 5 UC, n = 10 CD) to be associated with an increased onset risk.
      However, these findings could not be confirmed by similar or higher numbers of
      other studies. A possible protective role was found for grain-derived products in
      CD onset, but results were inconsistent for dietary fibre in UC and CD and
      grain-derived products in UC. No definite conclusions could be drawn for
      unsaturated fatty acids (UFA), protein and energy intake due to limited and/or
      inconsistent results. Six studies reported on diet and relapse risk, of which
      only two (n = 1 UC, n = 1 CD) had a prospective follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The
      current evidence is not sufficient to draw firm conclusions on the role of
      specific food components or nutrients in the aetiology of IBD. Furthermore, large
      prospective studies into the role of habitual diet as a trigger of relapses are
      needed, to identify new therapeutic or preventive targets.

AB  - Patients have strong beliefs about the role of diet in the cause of inflammatory 
      bowel disease (IBD) and in exacerbating or alleviating ongoing symptoms from IBD.
      The rapid increase in the incidence and prevalence of IBD in recent decades
      strongly suggests an environmental trigger for IBD, one of which may be dietary
      patterns. There are several pathways where diet may influence intestinal
      inflammation, such as direct dietary antigens, altering the gut microbiome, and
      affecting gastrointestinal permeability. However, data that altering diet can
      change the natural history of IBD are scarce, and evidence-based dietary
      guidelines for patients with IBD are lacking. Patients, therefore, seek
      nonmedical resources for dietary guidance, such as patient support groups and
      unverified sources on the Internet. The aim of this review is to identify
      patient-targeted dietary recommendations for IBD and to critically appraise the
      nutritional value of these recommendations. We review patient-targeted dietary
      information for IBD from structured Internet searches and popular defined diets. 
      Patient-targeted dietary recommendations focus on food restrictions and are
      highly conflicting. High-quality dietary intervention studies are needed to
      facilitate creation of evidence-based dietary guidelines for patients with IBD.

      bowel disease.
PG  - 1156-71
LID - 10.1111/apt.12500 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The therapeutic effect of enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease (CD)
      and the epidemiological associations between diet and inflammatory bowel disease 
      (IBD) implicate diet in IBD causation. There is little evidence, however, to
      support specific dietary changes and patients often receive contradictory advice.
      AIM: To review the literature on the impacts of diet on IBD causation and
      activity to produce guidance based on 'best available evidence'. METHOD: Review
      of Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases from 1975 to 2012 using MeSH headings
      'crohn's disease' 'ulcerative colitis' 'enteral' 'diet' 'nutrition' 'fatty acid' 
      and 'food additives'. RESULTS: Enteral nutrition with a formula-defined feed is
      effective treatment for CD, but approximately 50% of patients relapse within 6
      months of return to normal diet. There is no direct evidence of benefit from any 
      other specific dietary modification in CD, but indirect evidence supports
      recommendation of a low intake of animal fat, insoluble fibre and processed fatty
      foods containing emulsifiers. Foods tolerated in sustained remission may not be
      tolerated following relapse. Some evidence supports vitamin D supplementation. In
      ulcerative colitis (UC), evidence is weaker, but high intakes of meat and
      margarine correlate with increased UC incidence and high meat intake also
      correlates with increased likelihood of relapse. CONCLUSIONS: There is little
      evidence from interventional studies to support specific dietary recommendations.
      Nevertheless, people with IBD deserve advice based on 'best available evidence'
      rather than no advice at all, although dietary intake should not be
      inappropriately restrictive. Further interventional studies of dietary
      manipulation are urgently required.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Osteopenia and increased risk for fractures in IBD result from
      several factors. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the dietary intake of calcium
      in IBD patients. METHODS: A 22-item quantitative validated frequency food
      questionnaire was used for quantifying dietary calcium in relation to gender and 
      age, in 187 IBD patients, 420 normal- and 276 diseased controls. STATISTICAL
      ANALYSIS: Mann-Whitney, chi-square- and T-tests. RESULTS: The mean calcium intake
      was 991.0 +/- 536.0 (105.8% Recommended Daily Allowances) and 867.6 +/- 562.7 SD 
      mg/day (93.8% RDA) in healthy and diseased controls, and 837.8 +/- 482.0 SD
      mg/day (92.7% RDA) in IBD, P<0.001. Calcium intake was high in celiac disease
      (1165.7 +/- 798.8 SD mg/day, 120% RDA), and non-significantly lower in ulcerative
      colitis than in Crohn's disease (798.7 +/- 544.1 SD mg/day vs 881.9 +/- 433.0).
      CD and UC females, but not males, had a mean calcium intake well under RDA. In
      all study groups the intake was lower in patients believing that consumption of
      lactose-containing food induced symptoms, versus those who did not (105.8% vs
      114.3% RDA in normal controls; 100.4% vs 87.6% RDA in IBD). CONCLUSIONS: Diet in 
      IBD patients contained significantly less calcium than in healthy controls.
      Gender and age, more than diagnosis, are central in determining inadequate
      calcium intake, more so in IBD. Self-reported lactose intolerance, leading to
      dietary restrictions, is the single major determinant of low calcium intake.
      Inadequate calcium intake is present in one third of IBD patients and represents 
      a reversible risk factor for osteoporosis, suggesting the need for tailored
      nutritional advice in IBD.

PG  - 320-7
LID - 10.1097/SGA.0b013e3182a67a9a [doi]
AB  - The experiences of individuals with Crohn disease before and after receiving
      dietary fiber information have not been described in the literature. This article
      offers findings from a study that used four semistructured audiorecorded
      interviews during a 4-week time period for the purpose of exploring the
      experiences of 11 individuals before and after receiving dietary fiber
      information from a healthcare professional. The first and second interviews
      occurred immediately before and after the presentation of information. Follow-up 
      interviews occurred at 2-week intervals. Thematic analysis of the baseline
      interviews revealed 2 themes: (a) accepting a redefined (lower expectations)
      definition of normal quality of life and (b) continuing to look for answers.
      Three themes emerged from the follow-up interviews at Week 4: (a) reevaluating
      old diet-related concepts, (b) enjoying a healthier lifestyle at a self-set pace,
      and (c) enjoying positive physical effects of wheat bran consumption. This
      article examines the 3rd postintervention theme, "enjoying physical effects of
      wheat bran consumption." The relevance of this research is that nurses equipped
      with dietary fiber information may be better able to help some individuals with
      Crohn disease to explore the potential benefits of a well-rounded nutritious
      pattern of eating that includes wheat bran cereal.

TI  - Effect of infliximab induction therapy on secondary systemic amyloidosis
      associated with Crohn's disease: case report and review of the literature.
PG  - 333-6
AB  - Secondary systemic (AA) amyloidosis is reported as a serious complication that
      occurs in long-standing Crohn's disease (CD), with an incidence of 0.3-10.9%.
      Various therapeutic approaches using medicines and elemental diet have been
      recommended, but still there are no established standards of treatment for
      secondary systemic amyloidosis in CD. Only a few studies have shown the role of
      TNFalpha ihibitors in the treatment of AA amyloidosis over a long term period. We
      report the case of a 24-year-old male with CD complicated by AA amyloidosis with 
      renal and gastrointestinal tract involvement treated with infliximab as induction
      therapy. Intestinal AA amyloidosis progression occurred at the same time with the
      development of CD as an early complication, whereas duration of CD prior to the
      diagnosis of renal AA amyloidosis was 6 years. Infliximab therapy (3 infusions)
      caused a significant decrease of serum amyloid A protein (by 97.9%), C-reactive
      protein (by 70%), improvement of disease activity index, and CD caused clinical
      symptoms. At the same time gradual progression of the renal damage (reduction of 
      renal function) was not affected by the treatment. Direct efficacy of infliximab 
      infusions on serum amyloid protein level may support the hypothesis of TNFalpha
      induced reduction on the progression of AA amyloidosis described in previous
      study reports. Targeted histological analysis of tissue biopsy is crucial to
      clarify the presence of AA amyloidosis in CD induced multiorgan damage cases.

TI  - Nutritional therapy in pediatric Crohn disease: the specific carbohydrate diet.
PG  - 87-91
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000103 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Crohn disease is characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation in 
      the absence of a recognized etiology. Nutritional therapy in the form of
      exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) has an established role within pediatric Crohn 
      disease. Following exclusive enteral nutrition's success, many dietary therapies 
      focusing on the elimination of specific complex carbohydrates have been
      anecdotally reported to be successful. METHODS: Many of these therapies have not 
      been evaluated scientifically; therefore, we reviewed the medical records of our 
      patients with Crohn disease on the specific carbohydrate diet (SCD). RESULTS:
      Seven children with Crohn disease receiving the SCD and no immunosuppressive
      medications were retrospectively evaluated. Duration of the dietary therapy
      ranged from 5 to 30 months, with an average of 14.6+/-10.8 months. Although the
      exact time of symptom resolution could not be determined through chart review,
      all symptoms were notably resolved at a routine clinic visit 3 months after
      initiating the diet. Each patient's laboratory indices, including serum albumin, 
      C-reactive protein, hematocrit, and stool calprotectin, either normalized or
      significantly, improved during follow-up clinic visits. CONCLUSIONS: This chart
      review suggests that the SCD and other low complex carbohydrate diets may be
      possible therapeutic options for pediatric Crohn disease. Further prospective
      studies are required to fully assess the safety and efficacy of the SCD, or any
      other low complex SCDs in pediatric patients with Crohn disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Small bowel cleansing by capsule endoscopy has never been addressed
      in children. METHODS: Randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of five 
      bowel preparation regimens on the mucosal visibility surface (as percentage of
      visualized surface area). Group A: a clear liquid diet for 12 h on the day
      before; Group B: high volume polyethylene glycol (50 mL/kg, up to 2Lt/die); Group
      C: low volume polyethylene glycol (25 mL/kg up to 1Lt/die); Group D: 20 mL (376
      mg) of oral simethicone; Group E: 25 mL/kg (up to 1Lt/die) of polyethylene glycol
      solution plus 20 mL (376 mg) of oral simethicone. RESULTS: Overall, 198 patients 
      (53% male, median age 13 years) were enrolled. Preparation regimen visualization 
      scores were 14.1 +/- 4.2, 18.9 +/- 5.1, 17.8 +/- 5.5, 14.9 +/- 4.8 and 20.9 +/-
      4.6 in groups A, B, C, D and E, respectively (P < 0.01). Positive findings were
      found in 172 cases (87%), but no significant differences were observed in the
      diagnostic yield and tolerability. Interobserver agreement, k = 0.89 (95% CI 0.83
      +/- 0.71). CONCLUSION: This is the first report in children that supports the use
      of 25 mL/kg (up to 1Lt/die) of polyethylene glycol solution plus 20 mL (376 mg)
      of oral simethicone as the preparation of choice for capsule endoscopy.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Increased intake of dietary fiber has been proposed to reduce 
      the risk of inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease [CD] and ulcerative
      colitis [UC]). However, few prospective studies have examined associations
      between long-term intake of dietary fiber and risk of incident CD or UC. METHODS:
      We collected and analyzed data from 170,776 women, followed up over 26 years, who
      participated in the Nurses' Health Study, followed up for 3,317,425 person-years.
      Dietary information was prospectively ascertained via administration of a
      validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire every 4 years.
      Self-reported CD and UC were confirmed through review of medical records. Cox
      proportional hazards models, adjusting for potential confounders, were used to
      calculate hazard ratios (HRs). RESULTS: We confirmed 269 incident cases of CD
      (incidence, 8/100,000 person-years) and 338 cases of UC (incidence, 10/100,000
      person-years). Compared with the lowest quintile of energy-adjusted cumulative
      average intake of dietary fiber, intake of the highest quintile (median of 24.3
      g/day) was associated with a 40% reduction in risk of CD (multivariate HR for CD,
      0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.39-0.90). This apparent reduction appeared to be
      greatest for fiber derived from fruits; fiber from cereals, whole grains, or
      legumes did not modify risk. In contrast, neither total intake of dietary fiber
      (multivariate HR, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.58-1.17) nor intake of fiber
      from specific sources appeared to be significantly associated with risk of UC.
      CONCLUSIONS: Based on data from the Nurses' Health Study, long-term intake of
      dietary fiber, particularly from fruit, is associated with lower risk of CD but
      not UC. Further studies are needed to determine the mechanisms that mediate this 
      association.

TI  - [A case of Crohn's disease concomitant with IgA nephropathy].
PG  - 1265-71
AB  - A 34-year-old woman with underlying IgA nephropathy was admitted to our hospital 
      with chief complaints of abdominal pain and pyrexia. Computed tomography showed
      increased mural thickness of the ileum and increased mesenteric fat density.
      Colonoscopic findings revealed a longitudinal ulcer in the terminal ileum and
      irregularly shaped ulcers and a longitudinal ulcer scar in the descending colon. 
      Histopathological analysis of biopsy specimens from the ileum and descending
      colon showed non-caseating epithelioid cell granuloma. On the basis of these
      findings, the condition of the patient was diagnosed as ileocolonic Crohn's
      disease, and the patient received parenteral nutrition, followed by elemental
      diet. The patient was responsive to nutrition therapy, and the amount of uric
      protein decreased as her Crohn's disease activity index decreased. In conclusion,
      we assume that the Crohn's disease activity correlated with that of IgA
      nephropathy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dietary fats influence intestinal inflammation and regulate mucosal
      immunity. Data on the association between dietary fat and risk of Crohn's disease
      (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are limited and conflicting. METHODS: We
      conducted a prospective study of women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study
      cohorts. Diet was prospectively ascertained every 4 years using a validated
      semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Self-reported CD and UC were
      confirmed through medical record review. We examined the effect of
      energy-adjusted cumulative average total fat intake and specific types of fat and
      fatty acids on the risk of CD and UC using Cox proportional hazards models
      adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: Among 170,805 women, we confirmed
      269 incident cases of CD (incidence 8/100,000 person-years) and 338 incident
      cases of UC (incidence 10/100,000 person-years) over 26 years and 3,317,338
      person-years of follow-up. Cumulative energy-adjusted intake of total fat,
      saturated fats, unsaturated fats, n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)
      were not associated with risk of CD or UC. However, greater intake of long-chain 
      n-3 PUFAs was associated with a trend towards lower risk of UC (HR 0.72, 95% CI
      0.51 to 1.01). In contrast, high long-term intake of trans-unsaturated fatty
      acids was associated with a trend towards an increased incidence of UC (HR 1.34, 
      95% CI 0.94 to 1.92). CONCLUSIONS: A high intake of dietary long-chain n-3 PUFAs 
      may be associated with a reduced risk of UC. In contrast, high intake of
      trans-unsaturated fats may be associated with an increased risk of UC.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Crohn's disease (CD) is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) 
      caused by a combination of genetic, clinical, and environmental factors.
      Identification of CD patients at high risk of requiring surgery may assist
      clinicians to decide on a top-down or step-up treatment approach. METHODS: We
      conducted a retrospective case-control analysis of a population-based cohort of
      503 CD patients. A regression-based data reduction approach was used to
      systematically analyse 63 genomic, clinical and environmental factors for
      association with IBD-related surgery as the primary outcome variable. RESULTS: A 
      multi-factor model was identified that yielded the highest predictive accuracy
      for need for surgery. The factors included in the model were the NOD2 genotype
      (OR = 1.607, P = 2.3 x 10(-5)), having ever had perianal disease (OR = 2.847, P =
      4 x 10(-6)), being post-diagnosis smokers (OR = 6.312, P = 7.4 x 10(-3)), being
      an ex-smoker at diagnosis (OR = 2.405, P = 1.1 x 10(-3)) and age (OR = 1.012, P =
      4.4 x 10(-3)). Diagnostic testing for this multi-factor model produced an area
      under the curve of 0.681 (P = 1 x 10(-4)) and an odds ratio of 3.169, (95% CI P =
      1 x 10(-4)) which was higher than any factor considered independently.
      CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study require validation in other populations
      but represent a step forward in the development of more accurate prognostic tests
      for clinicians to prescribe the most optimal treatment approach for complicated
      CD patients.

      enteral nutrition in adults with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 28-35
LID - 10.1111/jhn.12133 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nutritional assessment and dietary intervention, particularly enteral
      nutrition, are important in the management of Crohn's disease (CD). National
      audits have reported that dietetic resourcing in gastroenterology is inadequate. 
      The present study aimed to identify current practice in the nutritional
      assessment and dietary management of enteral nutrition in CD, as well as
      investigate the factors that influenced it. METHODS: A nationwide questionnaire
      survey adopting complete population sampling of all 296 U.K. acute hospitals was 
      undertaken aiming to determine dietetic resourcing for gastroenterology. In
      addition, the case-note review method was used to investigate approaches to
      nutritional assessment and dietary management of enteral nutrition as treatment
      for active CD. RESULTS: Data were returned from 149 (56%) hospitals, providing
      assessment and management information on 190 patients. The median number of
      dietetic sessions dedicated to gastroenterology was 2 per week (interquartile
      range 4). Hospitals with five or more sessions per week dedicated to
      gastroenterology used a greater number of components in their nutritional
      assessment [mean (SD) 21.5 ( 5.0)] than those with fewer sessions [mean (SD) 19.6
      (SD) 6.1, P = 0.05]. Enteral nutrition was perceived to be effective in 100 (55%)
      of 182 patients. The major reasons for limited success were poor compliance and
      inadequate volumes consumed, as well as insufficient treatment duration.
      CONCLUSIONS: The components included in a nutritional assessment of CD patients
      are significantly lower in hospitals with fewer dietetic gastroenterology
      sessions. Focus on improving compliance and duration of enteral nutrition is
      urgently required to maximise the success of enteral nutrition in the treatment
      of CD.

TI  - Inadequate nutrient intake in patients with celiac disease: results from a German
      dietary survey.
PG  - 240-6
LID - 10.1159/000348850 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently, the only treatment for celiac disease (CD) is a lifelong
      gluten-free diet (GFD). Research has been carried out in various countries into
      the nutritional adequacy of the GFD in terms of macro- and micronutrients, mostly
      presenting conflicting results. However, no data for Germany are available to
      date. AIM: To elucidate the nutritional composition of a GFD and to compare it
      with non-GFD in a representative German non-CD population. METHODS AND PATIENTS: 
      A total of 1,000 patients who were members of the German Celiac Society (DZG)
      were invited to fill out a prospective 7-day food diary and a questionnaire. Data
      from 88 patients aged 14-80 years were analyzed and compared to the DACH
      reference values and to data from the German National Diet and Nutrition Survey
      (NVS II). RESULTS: No significant difference was observed for the intake of
      energy and macronutrients in male celiac patients compared to the NVS II. Only
      the fiber intake of male patients was significantly lower than that of the
      general population. Female patients, however, showed a significantly higher fat
      intake, but lower carbohydrate consumption. The average daily micronutrient
      intake of male and female patients, specifically of vitamin B1, B2, B6, folic
      acid, magnesium and iron, was significantly lower in celiac patients compared to 
      the NVS II. CONCLUSION: This study reveals inadequate nutrient intake by male and
      female celiac patients in Germany. Based on our findings, regular (laboratory)
      monitoring of celiac patients should be recommended.

TI  - Development of a low phenolic acid diet for the management of orofacial
      granulomatosis.
PG  - 527-37
LID - 10.1111/jhn.12046 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Orofacial granulomatosis (OFG) is a rare disease of unknown cause. A 
      cinnamon- and benzoate-free diet is successful in up to 72% of patients. Phenolic
      acids are among the chemical constituents restricted in this diet, which avoids
      some but not all of these structurally similar compounds. The present study aimed
      to: (i) develop a novel diet low in phenolic acids; (ii) implement this in a
      small clinical trial; and (iii) assess its nutritional adequacy. METHODS: A
      literature review identified 10 papers quantifying phenolic acids from which 91
      10-mg phenolic acid exchanges were devised. A phenolic acid exclusion diet with
      precautionary micronutrient supplementation was designed and implemented in 10
      patients. Phenolic acids were excluded for 6 weeks and were reintroduced at a
      rate of one exchange every second day for 6 weeks. Wilcoxon matched pairs tests
      analysed disease outcomes measured by an oral disease severity scoring tool at
      weeks 0, 6 and 12. Nutritional adequacy was assessed, excluding micronutrient
      supplementation, at weeks 0 and 6, and compared intakes with dietary reference
      values. RESULTS: The diet was nutritionally inadequate for a range of
      micronutrients. Seven of 10 patients responded. Mean [standard deviation (SD)]
      severity scores improved from week 0-6 [20.8 (9.39) and 10.1 (5.72); P = 0.009]
      and were maintained in five patients who completed the reintroduction [6.6 (3.13)
      and 7.2 (5.54); P = 0.713]. CONCLUSIONS: A low phenolic acid diet with
      micronutrient supplementation holds promise of a novel dietary treatment for OFG.
      Further work is required in larger studies to determine long-term outcomes.

TI  - The human gut microbiome: a review of the effect of obesity and surgically
      induced weight loss.
PG  - 563-9
LID - 10.1001/jamasurg.2013.5 [doi]
AB  - Recent advances in parallel genomic processing and computational mapping have
      been applied to the native human microbial environment to provide a new
      understanding of the role of the microbiome in health and disease. In particular,
      studies of the distal gut microbiome have proposed that changes in gut microbiota
      are related to obesity, the metabolic syndrome, and Western diet. We examined the
      changes in the distal gut microbiome composition as it relates to the lean and
      obese phenotypes, particularly after surgical weight loss. A PubMed search of
      publications from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2012, used the search
      terms weight, obesity, microbiome, and bariatric surgery. We included studies
      that provided information on subjects' weight and/or body mass index and a formal
      assessment of the microbiome. Certain bacteria, specifically the archaeon
      Methanobrevibacter smithii, have enhanced ability to metabolize dietary
      substrate, thereby increasing host energy intake and weight gain. With weight
      loss, there is a decrease in the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes phyla. One 
      major finding from microbial sequencing analyses after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass
      is the comparative overabundance of Proteobacteria in the distal gut microbiome, 
      which is distinct from the changes seen in weight loss without Roux-en-Y gastric 
      bypass. This review provides the practicing surgeon with (1) an update on the
      state of a rapidly innovating branch of clinical bioinformatics, specifically,
      the microbiome; (2) a new understanding of the microbiome changes after Roux-en-Y
      gastric bypass and weight loss; and (3) a basis for understanding further
      clinical applications of studies of the distal gut microbiome, such as in Crohn
      disease, ulcerative colitis, and infectious colitis.

TI  - A novel enteral nutrition protocol for the treatment of pediatric Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 1374-8
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0b013e318281321b [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Enteral nutritional therapy (EN) is an effective modality for
      inducing and maintaining remission in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease
      (CD). The standard protocol for EN provides patients with 100% of their caloric
      needs for induction of remission. The aim of this study was to determine the
      efficacy of delivering 80% to 90% of patient's caloric needs through EN, to
      induce remission in pediatric patients with CD. This approach allows patients to 
      consume remaining calories from a normal diet. METHODS: A retrospective review of
      charts from 1998 to 2010 was conducted at The Children's Hospital of
      Philadelphia. Remission (Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index <10) and
      response (decrease in Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index score of >/=12.5
      points) were calculated before and after treatment with EN. Weight z scores and
      laboratory parameters were evaluated in all participants. RESULTS: Forty-three
      charts were evaluated. Mean age of participants was 12.8 years (5.1-17.4), 67%
      were male and 33% female patients. Remission and response were evaluated in a
      group of 23 participants, with no missing data. There were reductions in
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P < 0.0001) and C-reactive protein (P < 0.02),
      and increases in albumin (P < 0.03). Mean Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity
      Index score at baseline was 26.9 and was reduced to a score of 10.2 at follow-up 
      (P < 0.0001). Induction of remission was achieved in 65% and response in 87% at a
      mean follow-up of 2 months (1-4 months). CONCLUSIONS: This novel EN protocol
      seems to be effective for the induction of remission in pediatric patients with
      CD and contributes to increasing weight and improving laboratory markers. This
      protocol may result in improved EN acceptance and compliance and will be
      evaluated prospectively.

AB  - Exclusive enteral nutrition is an effective therapy for the management of active 
      Crohn's disease, especially in children and adolescents. This therapeutic
      approach involves the use of a liquid nutritional product with the exclusion of
      normal diet for a period of many weeks. Although recent studies have helped to
      delineate some aspects of how exclusive enteral nutrition should be used, there
      remain many gaps in our understanding. In addition, several recent reports have
      provided intriguing insights into the mechanisms of this nutritional approach.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Oxidative stress is presumed to play an important role in
      Crohn's disease (CD) pathogenesis. Nevertheless, the evaluation of the intestinal
      antioxidant capacity through the analysis of glutathione peroxidase activity in
      CD remains to be determined. METHODS: 20 CD outpatients and 16 volunteers going
      through colonic cancer screening were enrolled. Colonoscopy with biopsies was
      performed in all individuals. Samples from inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa were 
      taken when there was CD endoscopic activity. Spectrophotometric assays were
      performed to measure tissue glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, and total
      (GSHT) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione in all samples. Demographics and clinical 
      characteristics were collected from clinical charts. RESULTS: Inflamed CD mucosa 
      presented reduced GPx activity compared to non-inflamed CD mucosa (42.94mU/mg
      protein vs 79.62mU/mg protein, P<0.05) and control mucosa (42.94mU/mg protein vs 
      95.08mU/mg protein, P<0.001). GSHT concentration was reduced in inflamed mucosa
      when compared to non-inflamed CD mucosa (0.78mumol/g vs 1.98mumol/g, P<0.01) and 
      the control group (0.78mumol/g vs 2.11mumol/g, P<0.001). A significant
      correlation was detected between GPx activity and GSSG (r=-0.599), disease
      duration (r=0.546), and thiopurine treatment (r=-0.480) in non-inflamed CD
      mucosa. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that reduced GPx activity is present in 
      inflamed CD mucosa. In addition, endoscopic activity, disease duration and
      thiopurine therapy could be associated with mucosal decreased antioxidant
      activity.

TI  - Environment and the inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - e18-24
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which consists of Crohn disease and ulcerative
      colitis, are chronic inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. In
      genetically susceptible individuals, the interaction between environmental
      factors and normal intestinal commensal flora is believed to lead to an
      inappropriate immune response that results in chronic inflammation. The incidence
      of IBD have increased in the past century in developed and developing countries. 
      The purpose of the present review is to summarize the current knowledge of the
      association between environmental risk factors and IBD. A number of environmental
      risk factors were investigated including smoking, hygiene, microorganisms, oral
      contraceptives, antibiotics, diet, breastfeeding, geographical factors, pollution
      and stress. Inconsistent findings among the studies highlight the complex
      pathogenesis of IBD. Additional studies are necessary to identify and elucidate
      the role of environmental factors in IBD etiology.

TI  - Laparoscopic surgery for inflammatory bowel disease--the experience in China.
PG  - 180-5
LID - 10.3109/08941939.2012.732664 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has risen rapidly
      in China over the last 15 years. Increasing numbers of people with IBD require
      surgery during their lifetime, but few reports of IBD in Eastern populations have
      been described to date. The aim of this study was to assess the short-term
      effects of the laparoscopic surgery for IBD in Chinese patients. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: From February 2010 to March 2012, 35 patients with IBD underwent
      laparoscopic operations and the clinical data obtained for these patients were
      reviewed. RESULTS: Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) (N = 21) and ulcerative
      colitis (UC) (N = 14) underwent laparoscopic surgery. In the CD group, the mean
      age was 37.4 years. Two patients (9.5%) required conversion to an open procedure.
      The median length of postoperative hospitalization was 9 (7-40) days. Overall
      morbidity was 26.3% and no patients required re-operation. In the UC group, the
      mean age was 55.2 years. The conversion rate was 14.3% (2/14). The median time to
      regular diet was 4 (3-10) days and the median length of postoperative
      hospitalization was 8 (7-25) days. Four patients developed postoperative
      complications and one patient developed ileostomy retraction requiring urgent
      operative intervention to rebuild the stoma. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic surgery in
      patients with IBD can be accomplished safely and with reasonable operative times,
      conversion rates and morbidity rates. The main advantages of the laparoscopic
      approach are rapid recovery, improved cosmesis, less postoperative pain, and
      patient satisfaction.

PG  - 787-96
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2012-302504 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics are derived from traditional fermented foods, from beneficial
      commensals or from the environment. They act through diverse mechanisms affecting
      the composition or function of the commensal microbiota and by altering host
      epithelial and immunological responses. Certain probiotic interventions have
      shown promise in selected clinical conditions where aberrant microbiota have been
      reported, such as atopic dermatitis, necrotising enterocolitis, pouchitis and
      possibly irritable bowel syndrome. However, no studies have been conducted that
      can causally link clinical improvements to probiotic-induced microbiota changes. 
      Whether a disease-prone microbiota pattern can be remodelled to a more robust,
      resilient and disease-free state by probiotic administration remains a key
      unanswered question. Progress in this area will be facilitated by: optimising
      strain, dose and product formulations, including protective commensal species;
      matching these formulations with selectively responsive subpopulations; and
      identifying ways to manipulate diet to modify bacterial profiles and metabolism.

TI  - Cellulose supplementation early in life ameliorates colitis in adult mice.
PG  - e56685
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0056685 [doi]
AB  - Decreased consumption of dietary fibers, such as cellulose, has been proposed to 
      promote the emergence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD: Crohn disease [CD] and
      ulcerative colitis [UC]) where intestinal microbes are recognized to play an
      etiologic role. However, it is not known if transient fiber consumption during
      critical developmental periods may prevent consecutive intestinal inflammation.
      The incidence of IBD peaks in young adulthood indicating that pediatric
      environmental exposures may be important in the etiology of this disease group.
      We studied the effects of transient dietary cellulose supplementation on dextran 
      sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis susceptibility during the pediatric period in mice. 
      Cellulose supplementation stimulated substantial shifts in the colonic mucosal
      microbiome. Several bacterial taxa decreased in relative abundance (e.g.,
      Coriobacteriaceae [p = 0.001]), and other taxa increased in abundance (e.g.,
      Peptostreptococcaceae [p = 0.008] and Clostridiaceae [p = 0.048]). Some of these 
      shifts persisted for 10 days following the cessation of cellulose
      supplementation. The changes in the gut microbiome were associated with transient
      trophic and anticolitic effects 10 days following the cessation of a
      cellulose-enriched diet, but these changes diminished by 40 days following
      reversal to a low cellulose diet. These findings emphasize the transient
      protective effect of dietary cellulose in the mammalian large bowel and highlight
      the potential role of dietary fibers in amelioration of intestinal inflammation.

AB  - Crohn's disease is a complex inherited disorder of unknown pathogenesis with
      environmental, genetic, and microbial factors involved in the development of the 
      disease. A remarkable feature of this disease, especially, but not limited to
      childhood, is the effective response to exclusive enteral nutrition therapy and
      the observed benefit from exclusion of normal diet (principle of exclusivity). We
      reviewed the possible mechanisms of action of enteral nutrition for induction of 
      remission and provided a hypothetical model (herein termed bacterial penetration 
      cycle) that integrates dietary components, bacteria, susceptibility genes, and
      the innate immune response in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease.

      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The role of dietary interventions and enteral
      nutrition in the management of IBD remains unelucidated. This study was to review
      the current evidence for dietary risk factors for the development of IBD and the 
      efficacies of dietary and enteral interventions. RECENT FINDINGS: High dietary
      intakes of total fats, polyunsaturated fatty acids, omega-6 fatty acids, and meat
      are associated with an increased risk of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. 
      Further prospective studies are required to confirm these observations. Among
      various dietary interventions, none has shown striking efficacy. Meta-analyses
      have shown enteral nutrition to be inferior to corticosteroids in adults with
      active Crohn's disease. However, in children, a meta-analysis has shown no
      significant difference in the remission rates between enteral nutrition and
      corticosteroid therapy. Although the evidence level is not striking, enteral
      nutrition may be useful for maintaining remission in patients with quiescent
      Crohn's disease. SUMMARY: Dietary risk factors for IBD and the therapeutic
      benefit of dietary and enteral interventions need to be confirmed by further well
      designed studies in large cohorts of patients.

AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) incidence has increased over the past fifty years but the
      explanation is unclear. CD can be brought into remission by liquid enteral
      feeding, but the mechanism for this response is unknown. We suggest that
      consumption of emulsifiers in processed foods may promote CD by increasing
      bacterial translocation. This is supported by evidence that (i) geographical
      variation in CD correlates with emulsifier consumption as does the increasing
      incidence of CD in Japan; (ii) although CD incidence also correlates with fat
      consumption, the response to enteral feeding is not affected by the fat content
      of the feed and (iii) very small concentrations of the emulsifier polysorbate 80 
      enhance bacterial translocation across intestinal epithelia. Undigested
      emulsifiers may increase bacterial translocation, particularly in the small
      intestine where the mucus layer is discontinuous. The hypothesis should be
      testable by trials of enteral feeding with/without emulsifiers.

TI  - Polyunsaturated fatty acids in inflammatory bowel diseases: a reappraisal of
      effects and therapeutic approaches.
PG  - 650-61
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0b013e3182810122 [doi]
AB  - Recent epidemiological studies highlight the key role of the type of consumed
      unsaturated fatty acid and the development of ulcerative colitis (UC). We aimed
      to review the potential mechanisms behind the antiinflammatory effects of
      unsaturated fatty acids on intestinal inflammation, to discuss their potential
      limitations, and to propose a new reappraisal of polyunsaturated fatty acids
      (PUFAs) in the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A literature 
      search using PubMed was carried out to identify relevant studies (basic science, 
      epidemiological studies, or clinical trials) with unsaturated fatty acids and
      IBD. Only articles published in English were included. IBD patients exhibit an
      altered lipid metabolism. While in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated
      the antiinflammatory properties of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in
      experimental models IBD, results of clinical trials have been disappointing. In
      addition, the impact of fatty acid on innate immunity as an alternative
      therapeutic approach is explored. This may offer insight into therapeutic avenues
      for designing n-3 PUFA diet therapy for IBD.

TI  - The interplay between fiber and the intestinal microbiome in the inflammatory
      response.
PG  - 16-28
LID - 10.3945/an.112.003046 [doi]
AB  - Fiber intake is critical for optimal health. This review covers the
      anti-inflammatory roles of fibers using results from human epidemiological
      observations, clinical trials, and animal studies. Fiber has body weight-related 
      anti-inflammatory activity. With its lower energy density, a diet high in fiber
      has been linked to lower body weight, alleviating obesity-induced chronic
      inflammation evidenced by reduced amounts of inflammatory markers in human and
      animal studies. Body weight-unrelated anti-inflammatory activity of fiber has
      also been extensively studied in animal models in which the type and amount of
      fiber intake can be closely monitored. Fermentable fructose-, glucose-, and
      galactose-based fibers as well as mixed fibers have shown systemic and local
      intestinal anti-inflammatory activities when plasma inflammatory markers and
      tissue inflammation were examined. Similar anti-inflammatory activities have also
      been demonstrated in some human studies that controlled total fiber intake. The
      anti-inflammatory activities of synbiotics (probiotics plus fiber) were reviewed 
      as well, but there was no convincing evidence indicating higher efficacy of
      synbiotics compared with that of fiber alone. Adverse effects have not been
      observed with the amount of fiber intake or supplementation used in studies,
      although patients with Crohn's disease may be more sensitive to inulin intake.
      Several possible mechanisms that may mediate the body weight-unrelated
      anti-inflammatory activity of fibers are discussed based on the in vitro and in
      vivo evidence. Fermentable fibers are known to affect the intestinal microbiome. 
      The immunomodulatory role of the intestinal microbiome and/or microbial
      metabolites could contribute to the systemic and local anti-inflammatory
      activities of fibers.

      from a European Prospective Cohort Study (The IBD in EPIC Study).
PG  - 575-82
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2012.453 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Obesity is associated with a proinflammatory state that may be
      involved in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), for which there are
      plausible biological mechanisms. Our aim was to perform the first prospective
      cohort study investigating if there is an association between obesity and the
      development of incident IBD. METHODS: A total of 300,724 participants were
      recruited into the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition
      study. At recruitment, anthropometric measurements of height and weight plus
      physical activity and total energy intake from validated questionnaires were
      recorded. The cohort was monitored identifying participants who developed either 
      Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). Each case was matched with four 
      controls and conditional logistic regression used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) 
      for body mass index (BMI) adjusted for smoking, energy intake, and physical
      activity. RESULTS: In the cohort, 177 participants developed incident UC and 75
      participants developed incident CD. There were no associations with the four
      higher categories of BMI compared with a normal BMI for UC (Ptrend=0.36) or CD
      (Ptrend=0.83). The lack of associations was consistent when BMI was analyzed as a
      continuous or binary variable (BMI 18.5<25.0 vs. >/=25 kg/m(2)). Physical
      activity and total energy intake, factors that influence BMI, did not show any
      association with UC (physical activity, Ptrend=0.79; total energy intake,
      Ptrend=0.18) or CD (physical activity, Ptrend=0.42; total energy, Ptrend=0.11).
      CONCLUSIONS: Obesity as measured by BMI is not associated with the development of
      incident UC or CD. Alternative measures of obesity are required to further
      investigate the role of obesity in the development of incident IBD.

TI  - Dietary intervention for oral allergy syndrome as a treatment in orofacial
      granulomatosis: a new approach?
PG  - 517-22
LID - 10.1111/jop.12041 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Orofacial granulomatosis (OFG) is a chronic granulomatous condition
      of the mouth, face and lips. Recent work demonstrates a high rate of atopy and
      silver birch sensitisation from skin prick testing (SPT). Oral allergy syndrome
      (OAS) is an acute oro-pharyngeal IgE mediated reaction, triggered by foods that
      cross react with pollens, most commonly silver birch. The aim of this study was
      to determine if patients with OFG and positive SPT to common OAS associated
      pollens responded to avoidance of cross reactive foods. METHODS: Patients with
      OFG and positive SPT to silver birch, grass, mugwort, ragweed and latex were
      required to avoid cross reacting foods, for 6 weeks and, in those who responded, 
      for a total of 12 weeks. All had standardized oral examinations and were given
      severity scores (SS) at each appointment. RESULTS: Twenty two of 47 (47%)
      patients had one or more positive SPT and 13/22 completed 6 weeks on the diet. No
      difference was seen in SS between weeks 0 (14.62 +/- 11.16) and 6 (13.31 +/-
      10.33; P = 0.656). Six of 14 (43%) had significantly improved SS (week 0; 19.17
      +/- 12.95, week 6; 10.83 +/- 4.99, P = 0.027). Five completed 12 weeks and no
      further improvement was seen (week 6; 11 +/- 5.57, week 12; 10.4 +/- 9.94; P =
      0.068). Two patients required no further treatments. CONCLUSIONS: On an intention
      to treat basis, only 2/14 patients improved and required no further intervention.
      Whilst this diet cannot be recommended routinely, the improvement seen in some
      patients raises questions about the role of OAS in patients with OFG.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The laparoscopic approach is becoming the gold standard in the
      surgical treatment of primary Crohn's disease. The aim of this study was to
      compare laparoscopic-assisted and open ileocolic resection for primary Crohn's
      disease. METHODS: We conducted a non-randomized, comparative, retrospective
      analysis of a prospective database from 1998 to 2010. The remaining 129 patients 
      were divided into two groups: laparoscopic-assisted group (Group L; n=64) and
      conventional group (Group C; n=65). There were no differences between the two
      groups as regards preoperative patient characteristics. Complications were graded
      according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. RESULTS: One hundred and seventeen
      (90.7%) patients had no complications. Out of 12 patients (9.3%) with
      complications, four (3.1%) had Grade I, six (4.7%) had Grade II and two (1.6%)
      had Grade III. There were no postoperative deaths (Grade V). Operating time was
      longer in Group L compared with Group C (P<0.001). Bowel function returned more
      quickly in the laparoscopic group in terms of return of bowel movements (P=0.018)
      and resumption of a regular diet (P=0.06). The mean length of stay was
      significantly shorter in the laparoscopic group (P=0.001). The mean follow-up was
      26 months in Group L versus 34 months in Group C (P=0.06). During follow-up, six 
      patients presented with small bowel obstruction in Group C, which was not
      statistically different from Group L (3 patients) (P=0.25). During the follow-up 
      period, there have been no recurrences of Crohn's disease in the laparoscopic
      group while 11 patients (16.9%) have developed a recurrence in the conventional
      group (P=0.001). CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic-assisted ileocolectomy for primary
      Crohn's disease of the terminal ileum and/or cecum is safe and successful in most
      cases. Laparoscopic surgery for Crohn's disease should be considered as the
      preferred operative approach for primary resections.

TI  - Tolerability of curcumin in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease: a forced-dose
      titration study.
PG  - 277-9
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e318276977d [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by chronic
      intestinal inflammation in the absence of a recognized etiology. The primary
      therapies are medications that possess anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive
      effects. Given the high use of complementary alternative medicines in pediatric
      IBD, a prospective tolerability study of curcumin, an herbal therapy with known
      anti-inflammatory effects, was conducted to assess possible dosage in children
      with IBD. METHODS: Prospectively, patients with Crohn disease or ulcerative
      colitis in remission or with mild disease (Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity
      Index [PCDAI] <30 or Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index [PUCAI] score
      <34) were enrolled in a tolerability study. All patients received curcumin in
      addition to their standard therapy. Patients initially received 500 mg twice per 
      day for 3 weeks. Using the forced-dose titration design, doses were increased up 
      to 1 g twice per day at week 3 for a total of 3 weeks and then titrated again to 
      2 g twice per day at week 6 for 3 weeks. Validated measures of disease activity, 
      using the PUCAI and PCDAI, and the Monitoring of Side Effect System score were
      obtained at weeks 3, 6, and 9. RESULTS: All patients tolerated curcumin well,
      with the only symptom that was consistently reported during all 3 visits being an
      increase in gassiness, which occurred in only 2 patients. Three patients saw
      improvement in PUCAI/PCDAI score. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests that
      curcumin may be used as an adjunctive therapy for individuals seeking a
      combination of conventional medicine and alternative medicine.

TI  - Enteral nutrition to suppress postoperative Crohn's disease recurrence: a
      five-year prospective cohort study.
PG  - 335-40
LID - 10.1007/s00384-012-1587-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term effect of enteral
      nutrition (EN) as a maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease (CD) patients
      following surgery. METHODS: This study was an extension of our previous study to 
      prolong the duration of intervention and follow-up from 1 to 5 years. Forty
      consecutive patients who underwent resection for ileal or ileocolic CD were
      included. Following surgery, 20 patients received continuous elemental diet
      infusion during the nighttime plus a low-fat diet during the daytime (EN group). 
      Another 20 patients received neither nutritional therapy nor food restriction
      (control group). All patients were followed for 5 years after operation. No
      patient received corticosteroid, immunosuppressants, or infliximab except
      patients who developed recurrence. The end point of this study was recurrence
      requiring biologic therapy or reoperation. Recurrence rates were analyzed on an
      intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS: In the EN group, four patients could not
      continue tube intubation for elemental diet intake. Two patients (10 %) in the EN
      group and nine patients (45 %) in the control group developed recurrence
      requiring infliximab therapy (P = 0.03). The cumulative recurrence incidence rate
      requiring infliximab was significantly lower in the EN group vs the control group
      (P = 0.02). One patient (5 %) in the EN group and five patients (25 %) in the
      control group required reoperation for recurrence (P = 0.18). The cumulative
      incidence of reoperation was lower in the EN group vs the control group, the
      difference not being significant (P = 0.08). CONCLUSION: The outcomes of this
      study suggest that EN therapy reduces the incidence of postoperative CD
      recurrence.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: To evaluate presence of sero-negative spondyloarthritis (SpA)
      in celiac disease (CD) patients, and whether compliance with a gluten free diet
      (GFD) improved arthritis manifestations in these patients. METHODS: We undertook 
      a prospective, questionnaire based, cross-sectional cohort study to evaluate the 
      presence or absence of SpA simultaneously in both CD and non-CD cohorts. RESULTS:
      356/590 (60.3%) patients with CD participated in this study. 99% had diagnosis
      confirmed by a diagnostic test (79% small bowel biopsy, 19.8% blood test, 3.9%
      stool test). Approximately 131 (37%) cases of arthritis were reported in CD
      patients. Of the 6/356 CD patients with seronegative spondyloarthritides, four
      had sacroiliitis, two ankylosing spondylitis, and one psoriatic arthritis,
      compared to one ankylosing spondylitis and five psoriatic arthritis in non-CD.
      Osteoarthritis (89 vs 59, P = 0.93) was the most common diagnosis reported by
      respondents. More CD patients with diarrhea (94%) and anemia (81%) improved on
      GFD, compared to arthritis symptoms (30%). Autoimmune thyroiditis (10.6% vs
      0.4%), insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) (2.2% vs 1.7%), systemic Lupus 
      erythematosus (SLE) (1.1% vs 0), and psoriasis (12.9% vs 5.5%) occurred more
      frequently in CD patients. The prevalence of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis,
      Sjogren's syndrome, primary biliary cirrhosis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis
      was around 1% each. Univariate Logistic regression analysis showed </= high
      school education (odds ratio [OR] 2.01, P < 0.003), age >/= 60 years (OR 4.13, P 
      < 0.001), and osteoporosis (OR 2.78, P < 0.001) to be significantly associated
      with report of arthritis in CD patients. CONCLUSION: We did not find a high rate 
      of SpA in CD patients. In contrast, increased rates of autoimmune thyroiditis,
      SLE, IDDM, and psoriasis were seen in CD.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To identify environmental risk factors for developing
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children <15 years of age. METHODS: IBD
      patients and randomly selected healthy controls from a well defined geographical 
      area in Denmark were prospectively recruited in the period 1.1.2007-31.12.2009.
      Data regarding socioeconomic status, area of residence, living conditions,
      infections and diet were obtained by a questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 118 IBD
      patients (59 Crohn's disease (CD), 56 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 3 IBD
      unclassified (IBDU)) and 477 healthy controls filled out the questionnaire. The
      response rates were 91% in patients and 45% in controls, respectively. Several
      risk factors for IBD were identified: IBD in first degree relatives (IBD: OR
      (odds ratio): 6.1 (95%CI: 2.5-15.0), CD (OR: 6.8 (2.3-20.2)) and UC (OR: 6.1
      (2.3-16.0))); bedroom sharing (IBD: OR: 2.1 (1.0-4.3), CD (OR: 3.6 (1.3-9.4)));
      high sugar intake (IBD: OR: 2.5 (1.0-6.2), CD (OR: 2.9 (1.0-8.5))); prior
      admission to a hospital for gastrointestinal infections (IBD: 7.7 (3.1-19.1), CD 
      (7.9 (2.5-24.9)) and UC (7.4 (2.5-21.6))); stressful events (IBD: 1.7 (1.0-2.9)).
      Protective factors were daily vs. less than daily vegetable consumption (CD: 0.3 
      (0.1-1.0), UC (0.3 (0.1-0.8))) and whole meal bread consumption (IBD: OR: 0.5
      (0.3-0.9), CD (0.4 (0.2-0.9))). An increased risk of diagnosis of CD compared to 
      UC was shown for patients living in more urban areas (OR: 1.3 (1.1-1.6)).
      CONCLUSION: We identified several risk and protective factors for developing IBD.
      Studies on the influence of environmental factors are important in our
      understanding of aetiology and phenotypes of paediatric IBD.

AB  - Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disorder resulting from an
      inappropriate innate and acquired immune response to commensal microorganisms in 
      genetically susceptible individuals. This disease has a fluctuating course, with 
      alternating periods of remission and relapses, and it is characterized by a
      remarkable clinical heterogeneity; it may be complicated by perianal fistulas,
      abscesses, and intestinal strictures leading to obstructions, besides several
      systemic manifestations. However, a complete resolution of the disease is
      currently not possible, yet Crohn's disease can be managed with established and
      novel therapies, which achieve long-term remission and acceptable quality of
      life. This review is focused on novel advances in basic and clinical aspects of
      Crohn's disease, although it also deals with new trends in diagnosis and
      treatment.
