TI  - [Diet therapy in chronic inflammatory bowel disease: results from meta-analysis
      and randomized controlled trials].
PG  - 2041-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic inflammatory bowel
      diseases of unknown etiology. Unspecific immunosuppressive therapy represents
      current standard treatment and is often associated with severe side effects.
      Several treatment regimens have been evaluated to identify alternative
      therapeutic options. Among these different diet therapies were investigated.
      Objective of this paper is to review the results of diet therapy in chronic
      inflammatory bowel disease on the basis of randomised controlled trials and
      meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. METHODS: Medline and Cochrane
      Library were searched for meta-analysis and randomised controlled trials
      investigating this question. Additionally reference lists of identified articles 
      and text books were checked for further trials. RESULTS: Four meta-analyses
      investigated the treatment of acute Crohn's disease with elemental-,
      semi-elemental-, and polymeric diets in comparison to corticosteroids or to
      another form of enteral diet. All meta-analyses show a superiority of
      corticosteroids and no difference in the effect of the compared enteral diets.
      Randomised controlled trials investigating diet therapy in ulcerative colitis
      have not been summarised in a meta-analysis yet. Eleven randomised trials were
      identified which evaluated diets in ulcerative colitis patients: Dietary
      supplementation with n-3-fatty acids (6 trials), elemental diet [2], dietary
      supplementation with dietary fiber [1], elimination diet [1], and dietary
      supplementation with olestra [1]. Only for the elimination diet a significant
      positive effect on the course of disease was found in one trial which
      investigated only 18 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Enteral nutritional therapy of acute 
      Crohn's disease is less effective than treatment with corticosteroids. In case of
      severe steroid induced side effects diet treatment can present a promising
      alternative. Superiority of one of the investigated different formulations was
      not found. Meta-analyses of randomised trials provide a clear and easy to
      understand presentation of the effect of this intervention. Eleven published
      trials investigating the effect of diets in ulcerative colitis show only for
      elimination diet a positive treatment effect. The trials do find a positive
      effect of one of the other interventions but the trials are very small and cannot
      exclude a treatment effect. Meta-analysis of these trials would be helpful for a 
      better presentation and understanding of these results.

TI  - Stones from bowel disease.
PG  - 979-99
AB  - Kidney stones are increased in patients with bowel disease, particularly those
      who have had resection of part of their gastrointestinal tract. These stones are 
      usually CaOx, but there is a marked increase in the tendency to form uric acid
      stones, as well, particularly in patients with colon resection. These patients
      all share a tendency to chronic volume contraction due to loss of water and salt 
      in diarrheal stool, which leads to decreased urine volumes. They also have
      decreased absorption, and therefore diminished urinary excretion, of citrate and 
      magnesium, which normally act as inhibitors of CaOx crystallization. Patients
      with colon resection and ileostomy form uric acid stones, as loss of bicarbonate 
      in the ileostomy effluent leads to formation of an acid urine. This, coupled with
      low urine volume, decreases the solubility of uric acid, causing crystallization 
      and stone formation. Prevention of stones requires treatment with alkalinizing
      agents to raise urine pH to about 6.5, and attempts to increase urine volume,
      which increases the solubility of uric acid and prevents crystallization.
      Patients with small bowel resection may develop steatorrhea; if the colon is
      present, they are at risk of hyperoxaluria due to increased permeability of the
      colon to oxalate in the presence of fatty acids, and increased concentrations of 
      free oxalate in the bowel lumen due to fatty acid binding of luminal calcium. EH 
      leads to supersaturation of urine with respect to CaOx, in conjunction with low
      volume, hypocitraturia and hypomagnesuria. Therapy involves a low-fat,
      low-oxalate diet, attempts to increase urine volume, and agents such as calcium
      given to bind oxalate in the gut lumen. Correction of hypocitraturia and
      hypomagnesuria are also helpful.

TI  - Effect of steroids on energy expenditure and substrate oxidation in women with
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 2843-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) have increased energy expenditure
      and fat oxidation. Steroids, commonly used to treat flare-up of CD, induce weight
      gain. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of prednisone and
      budesonide on energy expenditure and substrate oxidation in patients with CD.
      METHODS: Twenty-nine women with CD and 10 healthy controls were studied. Ten
      patients received prednisone (0.75-1.0 mg/kg/day), nine received budesonide (9
      mg/ day), and 10 did not receive steroids. Resting energy expenditure and
      substrate oxidation were measured by indirect calorimetry in a fasting state and 
      after a standard diet. RESULTS: In the fasting state, resting energy expenditure 
      was higher in patients without steroids than in the controls. Lipid oxidation was
      lower (p < 0.01) in patients with prednisone (0.46 +/- 0.39 mg/kg/min) than in
      patients with budesonide (0.97 +/- 0.28 mg/kg/min) and without steroids (1.06 +/-
      0.32 mg/kg/min), but was similar with control subjects (0.47 +/- 0.20 mg/kg/min).
      Postprandially, lipid oxidation was lower (p < 0.01) in patients with prednisone 
      (0.32 +/- 0.23 mg/kg/min) than in patients with budesonide (0.75 +/- 0.20
      mg/kg/min), without steroids (0.82 +/- 0.23 mg/kg/min), and controls (0.58 +/-
      0.15 mg/kg/min). Protein oxidation was significantly higher in patients with
      prednisone than in the other subjects. CONCLUSIONS: In women with CD, prednisone 
      decreases lipid oxidation and increases protein oxidation. These effects are not 
      observed with budesonide and may contribute to the weight gain and side effects
      commonly observed with prednisone. A low-fat/high-protein diet could be proposed 
      during a course of prednisone.

TI  - [Immunologic methods in diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease].
PG  - 468-71
AB  - Chronic inflammatory bowel disease is included into autoimmune diseases, which is
      proved by presence of inflammatory lesions, circulating autoantibodies and the
      deposits of immune complexes in tissues. Coeliac disease (classic and atypical
      form), Crohn's Disease and ulcerative colitis are considered as chronic
      autoimmune bowel diseases. The auto-antibodies can be detected with indirect
      immunofluorescence, ELISA and immunoblotting methods. In coeliac disease the
      autoantibodies against endomysium (tissue transglutaminase) and antibodies
      against gliadin are found in patient's sera. The auto-antibody detecting is
      helpful in establishing diagnosis, controlling gluten-free diet effectiveness and
      during gluten challenge. In Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis immunological 
      laboratory tests are helpful to confirm the clinical diagnosis. The following
      auto-antibodies are tested: against cytoplasm of exocrinal pancreatic cells, and 
      products of these cells, against the neutrophile cytoplasm and against goblet
      cells. The antibodies against Saccharomyces cerevisiae are also investigated. The
      clinical relevance of above autoantibodies is not clear, but it is suggested that
      their presence correlates with exacerbations and severe clinical outcome. In the 
      present study the pictures of autoantibodies from fluorescent microscope were
      shown.

TI  - Increased mucosal tumour necrosis factor alpha production in Crohn's disease can 
      be downregulated ex vivo by probiotic bacteria.
PG  - 659-64
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) plays a key role in
      the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation in Crohn's disease. The effect of
      bacteria on TNF-alpha release by intestinal mucosa was investigated. METHODS:
      Ileal specimens were obtained at surgery from 10 patients with Crohn's disease
      (ileal stricture) and five disease controls undergoing right hemicolectomy
      (caecal cancer). Mucosal explants from each specimen were cultured for 24 hours
      with either non-pathogenic Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus casei DN-114001, L
      bulgaricus LB10, or L crispatus (each study contained blank wells with no
      bacteria). Tissue and bacterial viability was confirmed by lactate dehydrogenase 
      (LDH) release and culture. Concentrations of TNF-alpha were measured in
      supernatants and the phenotype of the intestinal lymphocytes was analysed by flow
      cytometry. RESULTS: Coculture of mucosa with bacteria did not modify LDH release.
      Release of TNF-alpha by inflamed Crohn's disease mucosa was significantly reduced
      by coculture with L casei or L bulgaricus; changes induced by L crispatus or E
      coli were not significant. The effect of L casei and L bulgaricus was not
      prevented by protease inhibitors. Coculture with L casei and L bulgaricus reduced
      the number of CD4 cells as well as TNF-alpha expression among intraepithelial
      lymphocytes from Crohn's disease mucosa. None of the bacteria induced changes in 
      non-inflamed mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics interact with immunocompetent cells 
      using the mucosal interface and modulate locally the production of
      proinflammatory cytokines.

TI  - An adolescent with IgA nephropathy and Crohn disease: pathogenetic implications.
PG  - 863-6
AB  - We describe a patient with IgA nephropathy associated with Crohn disease. IgA
      nephropathy first appeared at the age of 10 years. Combined therapy with
      prednisolone, cyclophosphamide, warfarin, and angiotensin-converting enzyme
      inhibitor resulted in clinical improvement over the following year, and remission
      was maintained. At the age of 13 years, the patient developed Crohn disease and
      IgA nephropathy recurred. Significant increases in serum IgA were associated with
      progression of Crohn disease. An elemental diet combined with oral prednisolone
      resulted in clinical improvement of Crohn disease and in remission of nephropathy
      and normalization of serum IgA concentration. The clinical course of the two
      diseases was linked, suggesting a common pathogenetic mechanism involving an IgA 
      immune response to mucosal challenge in the intestine.

TI  - Growth in paediatric Crohn's disease.
PG  - 11-5
AB  - Growth failure (GF) is one of the major complications affecting children with
      inflammatory bowel disease. The faltering is temporary in 40-50% of cases and
      prolonged in 10-20% in Crohn's disease (CD). Such failure is rare in children
      with ulcerative colitis (5%). This complication is often associated with retarded
      bone development and delayed onset of sexual maturation. The delayed linear
      growth has a variety of causes including insufficient intake due to anorexia and 
      the inflammatory process with increased energy and protein expenditure. Other
      factors are increased intestinal loss, secondary hypopituitarism and treatment
      with steroids. Therapeutic strategies of CD in children have changed this last
      decade by introducing new therapeutic agents such as topic steroids,
      immunosuppressors, anti-TNF (antibody and notably in children enteral nutrition
      which has shown its efficacy in inducing remissions of active CD, restoring
      nutritional status and stimulation of linear growth. The results of a recent
      prospective multicentric study over 2 years in 82 CD show that severe GF (-2 SD) 
      is initially present in 15% (n = 12), among them 11 remain < -2SD after 2 years
      of follow-up. Six patients who were on the normal range initially increased their
      GF during the follow-up (< -2SD) (total 21% < -2SD (n = 17) at 2 years). At
      inclusion in this group there was no difference in growth velocity, used of
      steroids, enteral nutrition or severity of CD as compared to the group with no
      GF. It suggests that new treatment strategy should be developed in the future for
      this specific complication of paediatric CD.

TI  - Diet and gastrointestinal disease.
PG  - 567-9
AB  - Dietary manipulation can be an important part of therapy for several common
      gastrointestinal disorders. In Crohn disease, the provision of adequate protein
      and calories may not only improve symptoms but may be associated with
      acceleration of growth. In celiac disease, the dietary restriction of gluten is
      curative of the intestinal inflammation. In chronic nonspecific diarrhea and
      functional constipation, the provision of appropriate amounts of fiber and fluids
      may ameliorate symptoms. A thorough understanding of the role of diet is
      essential to the management of these disorders.

TI  - N-3 fatty acids for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 391-5
AB  - The aim of the present paper is to briefly review the literature relating to
      clinical studies of the use of polyunsaturated long-chain fatty acids in the
      treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis and
      Crohn's disease. The reasons for the discrepancies in the findings could be
      related to the different study designs, different treatments, overlapping of
      treatment effects, as well as the variety of treatment formulations and doses
      used, which have led to results that are, in certain instances, very difficult to
      explain. Emphasis on a treatment formulation which reduces the incidence of side 
      effects, together with careful selection of patients and experimental design,
      seems to be associated with benefits, and these studies point to the therapeutic 
      potential for these lipids in the therapy of IBD. It is possible that these fatty
      acids act by reducing low-grade active inflammation rather than by preventing
      reinitiation of the inflammatory process from a truly quiescent state. Whether
      this treatment is applicable to all IBD patients has not been fully elucidated.
      Nevertheless, taken together, all these studies suggest the effectiveness of
      these new therapeutic approaches, not only when conventional treatment fails or
      when it is not possible to treat chronically, but also, in some instances, as
      first choice.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel diseases: principles of nutritional therapy.
PG  - 187-98
AB  - Inflammatory Bowel Diseases - ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease- are chronic
      gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases of unknown etiology. Decreased oral
      intake, malabsorption, accelerated nutrient losses, increased requirements, and
      drug-nutrient interactions cause nutritional and functional deficiencies that
      require proper correction by nutritional therapy. The goals of the different
      forms of nutritional therapy are to correct nutritional disturbances and to
      modulate inflammatory response, thus influencing disease activity. Total
      parenteral nutrition has been used to correct and to prevent nutritional
      disturbances and to promote bowel rest during active disease, mainly in cases of 
      digestive fistulae with high output. Its use should be reserved for patients who 
      cannot tolerate enteral nutrition. Enteral nutrition is effective in inducing
      clinical remission in adults and promoting growth in children. Due to its low
      complication rate and lower costs, enteral nutrition should be preferred over
      total parenteral nutrition whenever possible. Both present equal effectiveness in
      primary therapy for remission of active Crohn's disease. Nutritional intervention
      may improve outcome in certain individuals; however, because of the costs and
      complications of such therapy, careful selection is warranted, especially in
      patients presumed to need total parenteral nutrition. Recent research has focused
      on the use of nutrients as primary treatment agents. Immunonutrition is an
      important therapeutic alternative in the management of inflammatory bowel
      diseases, modulating the inflammation and changing the eicosanoid synthesis
      profile. However, beneficial reported effects have yet to be translated into the 
      clinical practice. The real efficacy of these and other nutrients (glutamine,
      short-chain fatty acids, antioxidants) still need further evaluation through
      prospective and randomized trials.

TI  - Anti-inflammatory effects of enteral diet components on Crohn's disease-affected 
      tissues in vitro.
PG  - 430-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The mechanism of action of elemental diet in Crohn's disease
      treatment, is unknown. Alteration of bacterial flora, low antigenicity, low fat
      content and improvement of nutritional status are postulated to play a role in
      the anti-inflammatory effect of elemental diet. AIM: To determine whether
      elemental diet or its modifications has a direct anti-inflammatory effect on
      colonic tissue biopsies in vitro. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Colonic or ileal biopsies
      from 39 patients with inflammatory bowel disease and control patients were
      incubated for 24 hours with enteral diets in which nitrogen sources were amino
      acids as in elemental diet, casein or whey. Tissues were incubated with elemental
      diet, casein or whey, at dilutions of 1:5, 1:10 or 1:20 in Waymouth's complete
      medium; a medium control was also included. Tissue viability was assessed by
      bromodeoxyuridine uptake. Interleukin-1beta, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist
      and interleukin-10 concentrations in supernatants were measured by immunoassay
      (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). RESULTS: Incubation of tissues from Crohn's 
      disease with elemental diet resulted in an increase in the ratio of interleukin-1
      receptor antagonist/interleukin-1beta vs control statistically significant at
      1:10 (89.6+/-17 vs 45.7+/-9. 1, p<0.05). Incubation of Crohn's tissue with casein
      resulted in a significant increase of interleukin-1 receptor
      antagonist/interleukin-1beta ratio at dilutions 1:20, 1:10 and 1:5 (101.8+/-22.0,
      p=0.05, 142.8+/-24.6, p<0.05; 109.7+/-25.0, p=0.05). In ulcerative colitis tissue
      and non-inflamed non-inflammatory bowel disease control tissue, no significant
      increase in interleukin 1 receptor antagonist/interleukin-1beta ratio was seen
      after incubation with elemental diet, casein and whey. CONCLUSION: Elemental diet
      incubation increases anti-inflammatory:proinflammatory cytokine ratio in Crohn's 
      disease and this anti-inflammatory effect is not specifically due to amino acid
      composition, as diets containing casein have similar anti-inflammatory effects.

TI  - Epidemiology of inflammatory bowel disease--methodological considerations.
PG  - 364-9
AB  - The causes and mechanisms of action of inflammatory bowel disease have, so far,
      eluded discovery. Epidemiological studies have shown that ulcerative colitis
      tends to level off, whereas Crohn's disease tends to increase. Some of these
      changes may be due to diagnostic practices and increasing awareness of the
      disease and Crohn's colitis. The disease varies according to geographical
      location and a distribution along a north-south axis has been suggested. The
      differences may be due to study design, or may reflect differences in lifestyle, 
      diet or be due to genetic predisposition triggered by environmental factors.
      Epidemiological studies designed to investigate such interactions may provide
      clues to its aetiology. Inflammatory bowel disease could, therefore, serve as a
      model for the importance of epidemiology when to test or reject the hypothesis of
      aetiology.

TI  - Fat composition may be a clue to explain the primary therapeutic effect of
      enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease: results of a double blind randomised
      multicentre European trial.
PG  - 164-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dietary fat has been suggested to determine the therapeutic effect of
      enteral diets in Crohn's disease. AIM: To assess the efficacy of two whole
      protein based diets with different fat compositions (n6 polyunsaturated fatty
      acids v monounsaturated fatty acids) in inducing clinical remission in active
      Crohn's disease compared with steroids. METHODS: Sixty two patients with active
      Crohn's disease were randomised to receive, for not more than 4 weeks: (a) a
      polymeric enteral diet containing 35 g of lipids per 1000 kcal, high in oleate
      (79%) and low in linoleate (6.5%) (PEN1), (b) an identical enteral diet except
      for the type of fat which was high in linoleate (45%) and low in oleate (28%)
      (PEN2), or (c) oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/day). Diets were double blindly
      administered. The steroid group received a conventional ward diet. Treatment
      failure was considered when remission was not achieved at week 4. Clinical
      activity and biological and nutritional parameters were monitored. Independent
      predictors of remission were identified by stepwise logistic regression analysis.
      RESULTS: Overall remission rates (by intention to treat) were 20% (4/20) for
      PEN1, 52% (12/23) for PEN2, and 79% (15/19) for steroids (overall p=0.001;
      p<0.0005 steroids v PEN1, and p=0.056 PEN2 v PEN1). After excluding those
      patients who were non-compliant during the first week (per protocol analysis),
      remission rates were 27%, 63%, and 79%, respectively (p=0.008, steroids and PEN2 
      v PEN1). After adjusting for confounding variables, PEN1 remained significantly
      associated with a poor response. CONCLUSION: The type of dietary fat may be of
      importance for the primary therapeutic effect of enteral nutrition in active
      Crohn's disease.

TI  - Modification of enteral diets in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 457-61
AB  - The provision of food is thought to promote the maintenance of gut integrity.
      Nutrients are able to elicit and affect both systemic and mucosal immune
      responses. Enteral diet therapy has long been known to be efficacious in
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly in childhood Crohn's disease.
      However, the mechanisms of action of these diets are not clear. Nutritional
      repletion, direct effects on the gut mucosa or decreased intestinal permeability 
      have all been postulated as being important in nutritional therapy. There is some
      evidence that the enteral diet has a direct effect on the gut mucosa by reducing 
      cytokine production and the accompanying inflammation, thus leading to decreased 
      intestinal permeability. Modifications of enteral diet composition have been
      evaluated in many studies. Such modifications include fat and/or protein content 
      and the addition of bioactive peptides. The fatty acid composition of the enteral
      diet seems to have a much greater impact on its efficacy than modification of the
      N source. As specific fatty acids are precursors of inflammatory mediators
      derived from arachidonic acid, the reduction in these components may be
      beneficial in nutritional therapy for IBD. Addition of bioactive peptides to
      enteral diet formulas may also have a role; such peptides may have specific
      growth factor or anti-inflammatory actions. There is still much work to be done
      to define disease-specific enteral diet formulas that are effective as therapies 
      for both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

TI  - [Effect of composition of enteral nutrition on energy expenditure and CO2
      production during periods of average and excessive energy intake].
PG  - 298-301
AB  - UNLABELLED: The objective of the presented work is to evaluate to what extent the
      CO2 production and O2 utilization and energy metabolism at rest (REE) are
      influenced by an excessive nutrient intake and to what extent by the composition 
      of enteral nutrition. REE, CO2 production and O2 utilization were investigated in
      9 patients on complete enteral nutrition by indirect calorimetry in four
      modifications: I--nutrition with 40% kJ fat in a ration 1.2x the energy output at
      rest at the onset of the trial; II--40% kJ and high energy intake (2.4x energy
      output at rest; III--60% kJ fat in ration of 1.2x energy output at rest; IV--60% 
      kJ fat and energy intake 2.4x energy output at rest. At 40% (I) and 60% (III) fat
      content in a caloriocally adequate diet the energy output at rest, the CO2
      production and O2 utilization did not differ (mean +/- SD: 1438 +/- 264.1 kcal/24
      h, 179 +/- 31.6 nl/min, 209 +/- 38.1 ml/min vs. 1431 +/- 342.7, 190 +/- 54.2, 207
      +/- 46.5). Comparison of modifications II and IV revealed a significant (p <
      0.05) increase of CO2 production on a diet rich in carbohydrates (218 +/- 52.0
      vs. 202 +/- 42.3). The energy output at rest (1674 +/- 389.6 vs. 1661 +/- 378.7),
      nor O2 production (240 +/- 54.5 vs. 242 +/- 55.4) changed. Overfeeding with 40%
      fat (II) as compared with (I) led to a rise of the energy output at rest (p <
      0.05), O2 utilization (p < 0.05) and CO2 production (p < 0.01). Overfeeding with 
      lipids (IV) led as compared with III to a rise of the energy output at rest and
      O2 utilization; CO2 production did not change. CONCLUSION: The composition of
      enteral nutrition according to the described modification does not influences the
      energy output at rest, O2 utilization and CO2 production under conditions of an
      adequate energy intake. In case of an excessive nutrient intake nutrition with
      60% fat does not lead to an increase of CO2 production.

PG  - 48-52
AB  - Maintenance of adequate nutrition is of obvious importance in the management of
      patients with Crohn's disease. Exclusive parenteral nutrition can achieve high
      rates of remission, but this is not usually necessary since exclusive elemental
      and polymeric enteral regimes can yield similarly good results. Comparison of
      exclusive enteral formula feeding with steroid treatment favours steroids only
      because compliance is less complete for the restrictive nutritional regimes, and 
      formula feeds should always be the first choice in the growing child with active 
      Crohn's disease. It is probable that the nature of the lipid provided in Crohn's 
      diets is clinically important, and there is some evidence that the n-3 fatty
      acids are beneficial. Continuation of nutritional supplements once remission has 
      been obtained appears valuable even when malnutrition is not a major
      consideration.

TI  - Fine and ultrafine particles of the diet: influence on the mucosal immune
      response and association with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 123-30
AB  - Crohn's disease is a modern Western disease characterised by transmural
      inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. It is of unknown aetiology, but
      evidence suggests that it results from a combination of genetic predisposition
      and environmental factors. Bacterial-sized microparticles (0.1-1.0 microm) are
      potent adjuvants in model antigen-mediated immune responses and are increasingly 
      associated with disease. Microparticles of TiO2 and aluminosilicate accumulate in
      macrophages of human gut-associated lymphoid tissue where the earliest signs of
      lesions in Crohn's disease are observed. Dietary microparticles are of endogenous
      or exogenous origin. Endogenous microparticles dominate and are calcium phosphate
      (most probably hydroxyapatite), which precipitates in the lumen of the mid-distal
      gastrointestinal tract due to secretion of Ca and phosphate in the succus
      entericus. Exogenous dietary microparticles are contaminants (soil and/or dust)
      and food additives. TiO2, for example, is a food colourant, and aluminosilicates 
      are anti-caking agents, although some aluminosilicates occur as natural
      contaminants. Food additives alone account for ingestion of approximately 10(12) 
      particles/person per d. Possible mechanisms for the role of exogenous and
      endogenous dietary microparticles in promoting toleragenic or immune responses of
      gastrointestinal mucosal phagocytosis are discussed. In a double-blind randomised
      pilot study we have shown that a diet low in Ca and exogenous microparticles
      appears to alleviate the symptoms of ileal Crohn's disease, with a significant
      (P= 0.002) improvement in the Crohn's disease activity index. A multi-centre
      trial and further mechanistic studies at the cellular level are underway.

PG  - S100-S2
AB  - Patient education especially groups for patients with inflammatory bowel disease 
      belong to the typical tasks of Reha-medicine. In the Reha-Clinic "Ob der Tauber",
      Bad Mergentheim these patients are informed in special Colitis/Crohn-groups for
      eleven years now. Normally approximately ten patients with IBD are treated in our
      house at the same time. These patients participate in a nearly closed group in
      which they are taught in three weeks blocks. Three hours a week the patients are 
      informed by doctors, one hour a week a diet assistant teaches the participants.
      The psychotherapeutic group takes place regularly once a week. The aim of the
      patient information or health education is to reach a mostly complete information
      of the patients about inflammatory bowel disease, that means to inform them about
      all diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities. Another important purpose of team
      work is the support of dynamic group processes like reduction of anxiety and the 
      influence on the patients for developing an active positive attitude towards
      their disease. The participating therapist (doctors, psychotherapist,
      diet-assistant) have created a structured concept which was modified during the
      last years. Resulting from the interactive work between therapist and patients
      this concept is improved continuously. This development however is delayed by the
      shortcomming of bad personal capacities and the lack of possibilities for the
      therapist to improve their pedagogic and psychotherapeutic abilities. At the
      moment their education is based on autodidactic methods and empathy. For a
      standardization of the program including all hospitals the extended curriculum of
      the GRVS is useful. An evaluation concerning the therapeutic benefit of patient
      information has not been done yet.

TI  - Treatments for Crohn's disease that minimise steroid doses are associated with a 
      reduced risk of osteoporosis.
PG  - 541-6
AB  - Crohn's disease is associated with an increased prevalence of osteoporosis.
      Corticosteroids, commonly used to control exacerbations, appear to be a major
      risk factor for subsequent development of osteoporosis. Exclusion diets, avoiding
      foods that precipitate symptoms, frequently allow control of the disease avoiding
      the use of corticosteroids and may thereby reduce the risk of osteoporosis. To
      investigate this we performed bone mineral density measurements of the proximal
      femur and spine in 95 patients, 31 treated predominately by corticosteroids, 33
      by dietary manipulation with a low life-time corticosteroid dose and 31 by
      treatments other than diets but also with a low life-time corticosteroid dose. In
      both groups with a low life-time corticosteroid dose bone mineral density was
      comparable to that of age-matched normal controls, whereas bone mineral density
      was significantly reduced in those treated predominately by corticosteroids. We
      conclude that corticosteroid therapy is an independent risk factor for
      osteoporosis in patients with Crohn's disease and should be used as little as
      possible.

TI  - Short-term efficacy of enteral nutrition in the treatment of active Crohn's
      disease: a randomized, controlled trial comparing nutrient formulas.
PG  - 98-103
AB  - BACKGROUND: The optimal dietary fat content to induce clinical remission in
      active Crohn's disease has been the subject of controversy. We therefore
      performed a prospective, randomized, controlled study to compare the effects of
      nutrient formulas differing in the amount of medium-chain triglycerides (MCT).
      METHODS: Thirty-six patients with active Crohn's disease whose Crohn's disease
      activity index (CDAI) was > or =150 were included in the study. A formula with
      3.4 g of fat per 2000-kcal dose was used as the nutrient formula with a low-fat
      content (ED group), and a formula with 55.6 g of fat per 2000-kcal dose was used 
      as the nutrient formula with a high amount of MCT (TL group). RESULTS: The rate
      of short-term remission induction at 6 weeks was 67% in the ED group and 72% in
      the TL group (p = NS). Therapy markedly reduced the high CDAI and van Hees
      activity index in both groups, with no significant difference in the pattern of
      the time-course changes. C-reactive protein levels, erythrocyte sedimentation
      rate, and low serum albumin and plasma prealbumin levels normalized over the
      course of therapy, with no significant difference between the 2 groups. The
      assessment of fatty acid fractions revealed that the triene/tetraene ratio began 
      to increase at 2 weeks in the ED group. The serum levels of linoleic acid, an
      omega-6 fatty acid, almost always varied within the normal range during the
      treatment period in the TL group, but in the ED group, levels began to decrease
      significantly at 2 weeks. The levels of linolenic acid, an omega-3 fatty acid,
      decreased in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both nutrient formulas induced clinical
      remission in about two-thirds of patients. The results of the present study
      suggest that it is not necessary to restrict the amount of MCT when given in
      liquid form to patients with active Crohn's disease.

PG  - 40-3
AB  - Modifying the diet can have a favorable impact on the course of chronic
      inflammatory bowel disease. In contrast, nutrition plays no major role in the
      development of the disease or in provoking an acute attack. During an acute
      attack of Crohn's disease, the application of oral (drinks) or tube feeding
      (enteral nutrition) can result in a substantial clinical improvement. The
      remission rate of this side effect-free therapy is, however, lower than that seen
      with steroids. The data available for diet therapy in ulcerative colitis are less
      unequivocal, but the effects are probably slight at best. During the remission
      phase, the patient should eat a balanced, vitamin-rich and varied normal diet
      that excludes all poorly tolerated foods: lactose intolerance in particular
      appears to be increased in patients with Crohn's disease. Known vitamin or
      mineral deficiencies should be corrected by appropriate dietary measures or
      supplementation. There is no such thing as a "Crohn's diet" or "colitis diet".
      The patient can be allowed to eat anything that is tolerated.

TI  - Management of growth retardation in the young patient with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1-7
AB  - Linear growth retardation is a major complication of Crohn's disease that occurs 
      in children. It is related both to undernutrition and to direct effects of the
      inflammatory process on the growth axis. Enteral nutrition (elemental,
      semi-elemental or polymeric diet) employed as the sole source of nutrition
      remains a mainstay of treatment of active Crohn's disease because it corrects
      nutritional deficits, has anti-inflammatory effects, heals mucosal inflammation
      and stimulates growth. Conventional corticosteroids have adverse effects on
      growth and preliminary data suggest that an ileal-release preparation of
      budesonide may also suppress linear growth. 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) and its
      prodrug azathioprine maintain remission in children with Crohn's disease. These
      treatments thus have the potential to improve growth velocity and final adult
      height.

TI  - Crohn's disease and Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis: current issues.
PG  - 2103-10
AB  - Crohn's disease is a chronic debilitating inflammatory bowel disease of unknown
      etiology. Proposed causes include bacterial or viral infection, diet or exposure 
      to tobacco smoke, genetic abnormality, and immune dysfunction. The bacterium
      Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map) has received much research
      attention as a potential cause of the disease. Map causes Johne's disease in
      ruminants. The pathology of Johne's disease superficially resembles that of
      Crohn's disease in humans. Some researchers have shown evidence of Map in
      intestinal tissues of Crohn's disease patients. Studies are in progress to
      investigate the possibility that Map exists in milk from infected cows and
      survives pasteurization. This is a controversial subject with the potential for
      media attention and public outcry. We examined the current literature and
      concluded that insufficient evidence exists at this time to implicate any one
      factor, including Map in milk, as the definitive cause of Crohn's disease. The
      high degree of uncertainty in this issue requires regulators to recognize the
      need for effective risk communication as ongoing research provides additional
      information about the disease.

TI  - Treatment of inflammatory bowel disease in childhood.
PG  - 48-50
AB  - Of all patients with Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis, the first presentation
      of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is at a paediatric or adolescent age in 20%
      to 30%, most children being prepubertal at diagnosis. It is essential to provide 
      an accurate diagnosis in children suspected of IBD, as the initial treatment of
      Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis in children is not the same as it is in
      adults. While the role of enteral feeding in the treatment of Crohn disease in
      adults continues to be controversial, there is firm evidence to support the use
      of enteral feeding as primary therapy for Crohn disease in children. Nutrition is
      improved by enteral feeding, and growth and pubertal development are promoted,
      while the systemic toxicity of corticosteroid therapy is avoided. Supplementary
      nocturnal enteral nutrition (with daytime intake of normal diet) after primary
      therapy and remission induction may be associated with the prolongation of
      remission. Drug treatment in children with IBD is characterized by a lack of
      evidence from controlled trials.

TI  - Reduced plasma antioxidant concentrations and increased oxidative DNA damage in
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1289-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress is believed to play a key role in the pathogenesis
      of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-related intestinal damage. Circulating
      antioxidants may have a role to play in preventing free radical-mediated tissue
      injury. METHODS: Plasma vitamin A, E and carotenoid concentrations, leukocytic
      genomic damage and 8-hydroxy-deoxy-guanosine (8-OHdG) concentration were
      determined in 46 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, 37 Crohn disease (CD) patients
      and 386 controls. A 20 ml blood sample was taken from each subject for
      antioxidant and 8-OHdG measurements. A food frequency questionnaire was
      administered to a sample of subjects from each group to evaluate daily intake of 
      dietary compounds. RESULTS: Antioxidant concentration was significantly reduced
      in IBD patients, particularly in those with active disease, with respect to
      controls (P < 0.0001). 8-OHdG concentrations were significantly increased in IBD 
      patients compared to controls, independent of disease activity (P < 0.05). No
      correlation was found between antioxidant and 8-OHdG concentrations. Carotenoid
      concentrations were significantly reduced in malnourished IBD patients (0.89 +/- 
      0.14 micromol/l) compared to patients with normal or high body mass index (1.83
      +/- 0.12 micromol/l; P < 0.05), independent of disease activity or extension.
      Protein, fruit and vegetable intakes of IBD patients were significantly lower
      than those of controls. CONCLUSIONS: Depletion of antioxidants is likely to be
      important in the pathophysiology of IBD: UC and CD patients show increased free
      radical peripheral leukocyte DNA damage and decreased plasma antioxidant
      defenses. These results indicate the necessity of further studies to establish
      whether optimal vitamin status may improve the clinical course of UC and CD.

TI  - [Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies in patients with Crohn's disease].
PG  - 2303-7
AB  - Inflammatory Bowel Diseases are a group of diseases with chronic inflammation of 
      the gastrointestinal tract, but without proven etiology. Immunologic,
      environmental, infective and genetic factors equally can play role in their
      development. Antibodies to an oligomannose epitope of the Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae demonstrated in 60-70% of the patients with Crohn's disease. The
      origin and the clinicopathological role are not clarified. It is important that
      there are no surveys with patients suffering in gluten sensitive enteropathy in
      the literature. As there are no ASCA survey in Hungary, the aim of this study was
      to determine the prevalence of the ASCA. The authors examined at their patients
      the ASCA's occurrence and compared with the clinical picture of the Crohn's
      disease. The results supported the theory that ASCA positivity correlates with
      small intestines' Crohn's disease and in these cases both the IgG and IgA type
      antibodies proved. The antibodies in the sera at the analyzed ASCA positive cases
      prove a systemic immune response against Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the authors
      suggest the end of the oral tolerance against the yeast's antigens. The diet
      restriction (elemental diet, total parenteral nutrition, and fecal diversion) may
      ameliorate the status of the patients with Crohn's disease. It is speculated that
      the yeast-free diet as a part of the therapy for the ASCA positive patients can
      be reasonable: moreover the permanent "forbidding" of the yeast can be an
      acceptable alternative in case of getting well.

TI  - Laparoscopic-assisted versus open ileocolic resection for adolescent Crohn
      disease.
PG  - 543-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection for Crohn disease has been 
      reported as an acceptable alternative to the open procedure in adults. We
      evaluated our experience with this procedure in the adolescent population.
      METHODS: All adolescents undergoing ileocolic resection for Crohn disease during 
      a 3-year period were retrospectively reviewed. Intraoperative and early
      postoperative results were analyzed, comparing those undergoing the
      laparoscopic-assisted approach with those having open resection. RESULTS: Eleven 
      patients (mean age, 15.6 years) underwent open and 12 patients (mean age, 16.5
      years) underwent laparoscopic-assisted resection. None had undergone previous
      resection. The two groups did not differ with respect to time from diagnosis to
      surgery, indications for surgery, preoperative medical therapy, operative time,
      or length of intestine resected. One patient in the laparoscopic-assisted group
      was converted to an open procedure. There were no intraoperative complications in
      either group. Although no statistically significant differences were noted for
      number of days on narcotic, total dosage of narcotic, and time to regular diet,
      patients undergoing laparoscopic-assisted resection were discharged 2.2 days
      earlier (5.4 vs. 7.6; P < 0.05). There was one wound infection and one
      intraabdominal abscess in the open resection group, and a single patient in the
      laparoscopic-assisted group with postoperative fever and a wound infection.
      CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection is a safe alternative to
      open surgery in adolescent patients with Crohn disease.

TI  - A randomised controlled trial of high versus low long chain triglyceride whole
      protein feed in active Crohn's disease.
PG  - 790-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Polymeric feeds have shown variable efficacy in active Crohn's
      disease (CD) with remission rates from 36% to 82%. Meta-analyses of elemental,
      peptide, and whole protein feeds have shown a strong negative correlation between
      remission rate in CD and the long chain triglyceride (LCT) content of the feed.
      We performed a randomised controlled double blind trial in patients with active
      CD comparing two single whole protein feeds with LCT supplying 5% or 30% of the
      total energy. METHODS: Fifty four patients with active CD (Crohn's disease
      activity index (CDAI) >200, serum C reactive protein (CRP) 10 mg/l) were
      randomised to a high or low LCT feed for three weeks. The total amount of energy 
      supplied by fat was identical in the two feeds. Remission was defined as a CDAI <
      or =150 and response as a fall in CDAI of > or =70 or a CRP <10 mg/l. RESULTS:
      Overall remission rate by intention to treat was 26% for the low LCT feed and 33%
      for the high LCT feed (p=0.38). Response was achieved in 33% with the low LCT and
      in 52% with the high LCT feed (p=0.27). CRP <10 mg/l was achieved in 30% in the
      low LCT and 33% in the high LCT group (p=0.99). Thirty nine per cent (21/54) of
      patients withdrew before three weeks because of inability to tolerate the diet.
      Excluding patients unable to tolerate the diet, remission rates were 46% for low 
      LCT and 45% for high LCT (p=0.99). DISCUSSION: This trial has shown no difference
      in the effect of low and high LCT whole protein feeds in active CD. The
      previously reported correlation between LCT content of diet and response in
      active CD is unlikely to be due to LCT itself and may be due to some other
      component of high LCT feeds.

TI  - Nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 561-9
AB  - Nutritional derangements are frequent in inflammatory bowel disease. In the past 
      year significant work has been published examining the mechanisms of impaired
      food intake in animal models of inflammatory bowel disease, which allow a better 
      understanding of these processes. Data from the same laboratory have shed further
      light on the relative role of underfeeding and inflammation on the growth
      retardation associated with intestinal inflammation. Other studies have provided 
      further data on the risk factors and predictive biomarkers of bone loss in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The potential role of enteral nutrition
      as primary therapy for Crohn's disease is particularly addressed in this review. 
      Recent contributions to the field emphasized the special importance of this
      modality of therapy in paediatric patients. The possible mechanisms for such a
      therapeutic action are not well understood. Other nutrients may have a
      therapeutic potential in inflammatory bowel disease. In particular, recent data
      on the in-vivo anti-inflammatory actions of butyrate merit special mention.
      Finally, novel nutritional therapeutic strategies for inflammatory bowel disease,
      such as transforming growth factor-beta2-enriched enteral feeding, or
      hydrothermally processed cereals have recently been explored.

TI  - Enteral nutritional therapy for inducing remission of Crohn's disease.
PG  - CD000542
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease is controversial.
      Increasing research on the mechanisms by which nutritional therapy improves the
      clinical well being of patients with Crohn's disease has led to novel formula
      design and trials comparing two different forms of enteral nutrition. This
      systematic review aims to provide an update on the existing efficacy data for
      both corticosteroids versus enteral nutrition and for one form of enteral
      nutrition versus another for inducing remission of active Crohn's disease.
      OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of exclusive enteral nutrition as primary
      therapy to induce remission in Crohn's disease and to examine the importance of
      formula composition on efficacy. SEARCH STRATEGY: Studies were selected using a
      computer-assisted search of the on-line bibliographic databases MEDLINE
      (1966-2000) and EMBASE (1984-2000), as well as the Science Citation Index on Web 
      of Science. Additional citations were sought by manual search of references of
      articles retrieved from the computerized search, abstracts submitted to major
      gastroenterologic meetings and published in the journals: Gut, Gastroenterology, 
      Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, and Journal of Parenteral
      and Enteral Nutrition, and from the reviewers' personal files or contact with
      leaders in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomized and quasi-randomized
      controlled trials involving patients with active Crohn's disease defined by a
      clinical disease activity index were considered for review. Studies evaluating
      the administration of one type of enteral nutrition to one group of patients and 
      another type of enteral nutrition or conventional corticosteroids to the other
      group were selected for review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted
      independently by two reviewers and any discrepancies were resolved by rereading
      and discussion. For the dichotomous variable, achievement of remission,
      individual and pooled trial statistics were calculated as odds ratios (OR) with
      95% confidence intervals (CI); both fixed and random effect models were used. The
      results for each analysis were tested for heterogeneity using the chi square
      statistic. The studies were separated into two groups: A. one form of enteral
      nutrition compared with another form of enteral nutrition and B. one form of
      enteral nutrition compared with corticosteroids. Subgroup analyses were conducted
      on the basis of clinical or disease criteria and formula composition. Sensitivity
      analyses were conducted on the basis of the inclusion of abstracts of studies not
      yet fully published, methodologic quality and by random or fixed effects models. 
      MAIN RESULTS: In part A, of the 11 trials (one abstract) comparing different
      formulations of enteral nutrition ten compared one [or more (Middleton (a)1995)] 
      elemental formulas to a non-elemental diet. The eleventh study (Akobeng 2000)
      compared two non-elemental diets differing only by glutamine enrichment in one
      group. This study was therefore not included in the primary analysis but was part
      of the subgroup analyses. Meta-analysis of nine studies which included 170
      patients treated with an elemental diet and 128 patients treated with a
      non-elemental diet for active Crohn's disease demonstrated no significant
      difference among diet formulations [OR 1.15 (95% CI: 0.64, 2.08)]. Significant
      heterogeneity was not present [chi-square 9.77 (df=8)]. Subgroup and sensitivity 
      analyses had no significant effect on the results. In part B, six trials (two
      abstracts) comparing enteral nutrition to steroid therapy met the inclusion
      criteria for review. Meta-analysis of four trials that included 130 patients
      treated with enteral nutrition and 123 treated with steroids yielded a pooled OR 
      of 0.30 favouring steroid therapy (95% CI: 0.17, 0.52). Heterogeneity was not
      demonstrated [chi-square 0.43 (df=3)]. The risk difference calculated from this
      meta-analysis was 0.26, and the NNT (number of patients needed to treat with
      steroids rather than enteral nutrition to achieve one remission) was four. The
      same result was found in a sensitivity analysis that included abstracts. The
      inclusion of abstracts resulted in an increase in the number of participants to
      150 in the enteral nutrition group and 142 in the steroid group but the
      meta-analysis yielded a similar result [OR 0.34 (95% CI: 0.20, 0.56)]. There were
      inadequate data from full publications to perform further subgroup analyses by
      age, disease duration and disease location. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS:
      Corticosteroid therapy is more effective than enteral nutrition for inducing
      remission of active Crohn's disease as was found in past meta-analyses. There is 
      no significant difference in the efficacy of elemental and non-elemental diets
      for induction of remission of Crohn's disease.

TI  - Effect of enteral nutrition on antioxidant enzyme systems and inflammation in
      paediatric Crohn's disease.
PG  - 883-8
AB  - UNLABELLED: Crohn's disease is characterized by chronic inflammation of the
      gastrointestinal mucosa, which can be successfully treated with enteral
      nutrition. In this study, the activities of the antioxidant metalloenzymes
      copper/zinc-superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) and selenium-glutathione peroxidase 
      (Se-GPx) were determined in erythrocyte lysates from children with Crohn's
      disease. Both enzymes exhibited significantly lower activities relative to
      healthy control subjects: 1.55 +/- 0.33 vs 2.13 +/- 0.75 SOD U mg(-1) protein (p 
      < 0.025) for Cu/Zn-SOD, and 61.9 +/- 17.7 vs 93.6 +/- 28.7 mU mg(-1) protein (p <
      0.01) for Se-GPx. Treatment of patients with a specific polymeric diet, CT3211,
      for a period of 8 wk did not significantly alter the activities of the enzymes.
      In contrast, clinically, enteral nutritional therapy induced a remission in 13/14
      children, and a significant fall in both median serum C-reactive protein and mean
      serum tumour necrosis factor-alpha levels. CONCLUSION: The results imply that the
      anti-inflammatory action of enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease is caused by a
      mechanism other than restitution of these antioxidant enzymes.

TI  - Brain white-matter lesions in celiac disease: a prospective study of 75
      diet-treated patients.
PG  - E21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease (CD), or gluten sensitivity, is considered to be a
      state of heightened immunologic responsiveness to ingested gluten proteins in
      genetically predisposed individuals. The gastrointestinal manifestation suggests 
      a severe enteropathy of the small intestine with malabsorption, steatorrhea, and 
      weight loss because of a deranged mucosal immune response. Neurologic
      complications occur, especially epilepsy, possibly associated with occipital
      calcifications or folate deficiency and cerebellar ataxia. There have been
      reports of brain white-matter lesions as an extraintestinal manifestation in
      Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis but not in CD. METHODS: In this study, 75
      diet-treated mainly pediatric patients with biopsy-proven CD underwent
      prospectively clinical neurologic examinations, laboratory investigations,
      electroencephalography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. The 
      age range was 2.8 to 24.2 years with a mean of 11.6 years. The mean period of
      gluten exposure was 2.4 years. RESULTS: Ten patients had neurologic findings such
      as febrile seizures, single generalized seizures, mild ataxia, and muscular
      hypotonia with retarded motor development. No folate deficiency was found. The
      hippocampal regions showed no abnormalities. Computed tomography did not reveal
      any cerebral calcifications, but magnetic resonance imaging detected unilateral
      and bilateral T2-hyperintensive white-matter lesions in 15 patients (20%). There 
      was no correlation between these lesions and dietary compliance or neurologic or 
      electroencephalographic abnormalities. The mean gluten exposure time of these
      patients was slightly increased (not significant). CONCLUSIONS: Focal
      white-matter lesions in the brain may represent an extraintestinal manifestation 
      of CD. They may be ischemic in origin as a result of a vasculitis or caused by
      inflammatory demyelination. They seem to be more typical of pediatric CD than
      cerebral calcifications. Their prognostic value is unclear and needs to be
      elucidated in additional studies. CD should be suggested as a differential
      diagnosis in children with unclear white-matter lesions even without intestinal
      symptoms.

TI  - [Intestinal permeability in Crohn's disease and effects of elemental dietary
      therapy].
PG  - 636-43
AB  - Enteral intake of non-metabolic monosacharide and disaccharide, followed by
      measurement of the urinary excretion ratio of the two, is a method used to
      investigate intestinal permeability. L/R ratio (lactulose/1-rhamnose urinary
      excretion ratio) is considered an indicator of permeability of the small
      intestine. An increased L/R ratio is caused by mucosal disorders of the small
      intestine. The L/R ratio in all patients (n = 92) with Crohn's disease was 0.079 
      +/- 0.081 (mean +/- S.D.), which was significantly higher than the value in
      normal controls (0.027 +/- 0.009, n = 20, p < 0.05). In 39 patients with Crohn's 
      disease, we assessed intestinal permeability before after treatment with an
      elemental diet, and during remission. The L/R ratio was 0.120 +/- 0.092, before
      treatment and 0.065 +/- 0.097 after treatment (p < 0.05), showing increased
      intestinal permeability before elemental dietary treatment. During remission, the
      L/R ratio was 0.035 +/- 0.028; this did not differ significantly from the value
      obtained after treatment. We conclude that intestinal permeability is useful for 
      investigating disease activity in patients with Crohn's disease.

TI  - Advantages of laparoscopic resection for ileocolic Crohn's disease. Improved
      outcomes and reduced costs.
PG  - 450-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic colorectal procedures are considered to be technically
      challenging, and there is a lack of consensus regarding the magnitude of their
      benefits. The laparoscopic approach is generally held to be more expensive. Using
      a model of a single procedure performed for a single indication (ileocolic
      resection for Crohn's disease [CD]), we set out to demonstrate the feasibility of
      this procedure by determining the conversion rate, documenting the patient
      benefits, and performing a formal cost analysis. METHODS: Consecutive cases of
      laparoscopic ileocolic resection for CD were identified (LAP). Case-match
      methodology identified a series of open laparotomy controls (OPEN) that were
      matched for five potential confounding criteria: age, gender, diagnosis, type of 
      resection, and date of operation. Pre-, intra-, and postoperative details were
      gathered. Medical resource utilization was tracked using a standardized database,
      and all costs were reported in 1999 dollars. RESULTS: The conversion rate was
      5.9%. Resolution of ileus occurred more rapidly in the LAP than in the OPEN
      group. The time to clears in the LAP group was a median of 0 days (range, 0-4) vs
      3.0 days (range, 2-8) in the OPEN group (p = 0.0001). Time to regular diet was
      2.0 days (range, 1-6) in the LAP group vs 5.0 days (range, 3-12) in the OPEN
      group (p = 0.0001). Length of hospital stay was significantly reduced in the LAP 
      group (4.0 days [range, 2-8], vs 7.0 days [range, 3-14], p = 0.0001). The LAP
      group had significantly lower direct costs ($8684 vs $11,373) and indirect costs 
      ($1358 vs $2349) than the OPEN group (p < 0.001). This resulted in total costs of
      $9895 for LAP vs $13,268 for OPEN (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic ileocolic
      resection for CD is feasible. There are significant postoperative benefits in
      terms of resolution of ileus, narcotic use, and hospital stay. This approach
      translates into cost savings of >$3300 for laparoscopic patients.

TI  - Does adjuvant nutritional support diminish steroid dependency in Crohn disease?
PG  - 383-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nutritional therapy plays an important role in the management of
      Crohn disease, particularly during the acute phase. Nutritional supplementation
      may also prevent relapses during the quiescent phase of Crohn disease, though
      this aspect has not been widely explored. METHODS: Thirty-three patients with
      Crohn disease in remission were studied. All had steroid-dependent disease.
      Patients were randomized to receive either elemental diet (n = 19, EO28 Extra) or
      polymeric diet (Forticips, n = 14). The supplement was given orally in addition
      to normal food in an amount to provide 35%-50% of pre-trial total calorie intake.
      Prednisolone was withdrawn gradually. Patients were followed up for 12 months.
      Failure was defined as increase in CDAI by 100 points from baseline to >200,
      inability to withdraw chronic steroid therapy completely, need for surgery or
      steroid therapy. RESULTS: The nutritional supplement was successful in 14 (43%)
      patients who remained in remission for 12 months with complete withdrawal of
      steroids. The response to elemental diet (42%) was similar to that of polymeric
      diet (43%). Nutrition supplement failed in 13 (39%). Six (18%) patients were
      intolerant to enteral feeding because of smell and taste problems. Per-protocol
      analysis of data indicated that the success rate of nutrition supplement in
      steroid-dependent patients was 52% (14 out of 27 patients). No disease or
      patient-related factors helped predict the response to nutrition supplement.
      CONCLUSION: Nutritional supplementation with either an elemental or polymeric
      diet may provide a safe and effective alternative to chronic steroid therapy in
      patients with steroid-dependent Crohn disease.

TI  - Laparoscopic versus open bowel resection for Crohn's disease.
PG  - 237-42
AB  - BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic bowel resection is an alternative to open surgery for
      patients with Crohn's disease requiring surgical resection. The present report
      describes a seven-year experience with the laparoscopic treatment of Crohn's
      disease compared with the open technique in a tertiary Canadian centre. PATIENTS 
      AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 61 consecutive patients undergoing
      elective resection for Crohn's disease was carried out between October 1992 and
      June 1999. This analysis included 32 laparoscopic resections (mean age 33 years) 
      and 29 open resections (mean age 42 years). Patient demographics were compared,
      as well as short and long term outcomes after surgery (mean follow-up 39 months).
      RESULTS: Patients in the laparoscopic group were younger and had fewer previous
      bowel surgeries than patients who had open resections. Indications for surgery
      and operative times were similar between the groups. Patients who underwent
      laparoscopic resections required fewer doses of narcotic analgesics. The
      resumption of bowel function after surgery, and tolerance of a clear liquid and
      solid diet was quicker in the laparoscopic group. Patients who underwent
      laparoscopic resections had significantly shorter hospital stays than those who
      underwent open resections. Fifteen patients (48.4%) in the laparoscopic group
      experienced recurrence of disease compared with 13 patients (44.8%) in the open
      group. In both groups, the most common site of recurrence was at the anastomosis.
      The disease-free interval was the same length for both groups (23.9+/-17.3 months
      for the laparoscopic resection patients compared with 23.9+/-20.2 months for the 
      open resection patients; P=1.00). CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic resection for Crohn's
      disease can be performed safely and effectively. Quicker resumption of oral
      feeds, less postoperative pain and earlier discharge from hospital are advantages
      of the laparoscopic method. No differences in the recurrence rate or the
      disease-free interval were noted.

TI  - The urban diet and Crohn's disease: is there a relationship?
PG  - 93-5
AB  - The aetiology and pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) remain to be elucidated.
      In addition to genetic influences and immune mediated cytokine gene activation,
      various specific and non-specific environmental factors are considered to be
      associated with the induction and/or exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD). The incidence of CD is higher in urban areas than in the rural,
      environment. Patients with CD have a higher dietary intake of sucrose, refined
      carbohydrates and (omega-6 fatty acids, and reduced intake of fruit and
      vegetables. Elemental and exclusion diets are known to be effective in CD.
      However, patients relapse on returning to a normal diet, which suggests that
      there is something in an ordinary diet which, on penetrating the mucosal defence 
      mechanism of the terminal ileum, generates a pathogenic immune process. It has
      been suggested that the urban diet contains large quantities of inert inorganic
      non-nutrient microparticles, such as natural contaminants (soil and dust), food
      additives and anti-caking agents which may combine with intestinal luminal
      components such as bacterial cell wall lipopolysaccharides, to form antigenic
      particles. When these are taken up by mucosal mononuclear cells they can mediate 
      immune reactions both locally in the mucosa and in the systemic circulation. In a
      study published in this issue of the journal, CD patients allocated to a low
      microparticle diet experienced a significant reduction in CD activity and the
      requirement for corticosteroids, when compared with the control group on a normal
      diet. The main advantage of the microparticle free diet, when compared with
      elemental and exclusion diets, is its enhanced tolerance by the patients and its 
      relatively low cost. The preliminary results may give an explanation for the
      rising incidence of the disease in urban society. The results of an on-going
      multi-centre trial by the authors are awaited with interest.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of a low microparticle diet in a double blind,
      randomized, pilot study in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 101-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ultrafine and fine particles are potent adjuvants in antigen-mediated
      immune responses, and cause inflammation in susceptible individuals. Following
      recent findings that microparticles accumulate in the phagocytes of intestinal
      lymphoid aggregates, this study is the first investigation of whether their
      reduction in the diet improves the symptoms of Crohn's disease. METHODS: In a
      double blind study, 20 patients with active corticosteroid-treated ileal or
      ileo-colonic Crohn's disease randomly received either a low microparticle diet
      (trial group; n = 10) or a control diet (n = 10) for 4 months. Crohn's disease
      activity index (CDAI) and corticosteroid requirements were compared. RESULTS: One
      patient in each group was withdrawn. In the trial group there was a progressive
      decrease in CDAI from entry (392 +/- 25) to month 4 (145 +/- 47) (P = 0.002 vs
      control group) and seven patients were in remission (CDAI <150). In contrast, the
      control group had returned to baseline levels (302 +/- 28 on entry and 295 +/- 25
      at month 4), with none in remission. Corticosteroid intake was reduced more in
      the trial group although this did not reach significance. CONCLUSIONS: A low
      microparticle diet may be effective in the management of ileal Crohn's disease
      and could explain the efficacy of elemental diets, which similarly are low in
      microparticles.

TI  - Review article: Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis as one cause of
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 337-46
AB  - A number of theories regarding the aetiology of Crohn's disease have been
      proposed. Diet, infections, other unidentified environmental factors and immune
      disregulation, all working under the influence of a genetic predisposition, have 
      been viewed with suspicion. Many now believe that Crohn's disease is a syndrome
      caused by several aetiologies. The two leading theories are the infectious and
      autoimmune theories. The leading infectious candidate is Mycobacterium avium
      subspecies paratuberculosis (Mycobacterium paratuberculosis), the causative agent
      of Johne's disease, an inflammatory bowel disease in a variety of mammals
      including cattle, sheep, deer, bison, monkeys and chimpanzees. The evidence to
      support M. paratuberculosis infection as a cause of Crohn's disease is mounting
      rapidly. Technical advances have allowed the identification and/or isolation of
      M. paratuberculosis from a significantly higher proportion of Crohn's disease
      tissues than from controls. These methodologies include: (i) improved culture
      techniques; (ii) development of M. paratuberculosis-specific polymerase chain
      reaction assays; (iii) development of a novel in situ hybridization method; (iv) 
      efficacy of macrolide and anti-mycobacterial drug therapies; and (v) discovery of
      Crohn's disease-specific seroreactivity against two specific M. paratuberculosis 
      recombinant antigens. The causal role for M. paratuberculosis in Crohn's disease 
      and correlation of infection with specific stratification(s) of the disorder need
      to be investigated. The data implicating Crohn's as an autoimmune disorder may be
      viewed in a manner that supports the mycobacterial theory. The mycobacterial
      theory and the autoimmune theory are complementary; the first deals with the
      aetiology of the disorder, the second deals with its pathogenesis. Combined
      therapies directed against a mycobacterial aetiology and inflammation may be the 
      optimal treatment of the disease.
