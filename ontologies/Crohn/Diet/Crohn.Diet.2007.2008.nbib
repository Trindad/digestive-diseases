TI  - Quality, clinical influence and tolerance of computed tomography enteroclysis in 
      patients with suspected small bowel disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Computed tomography enteroclysis (CTE) may be superior to other small
      bowel imaging techniques, detecting subtle mucosal lesions and extraluminal
      pathology. This study aimed to define the technical success, clinical influence
      and tolerance of CTE in patients with suspected small bowel disease. METHODS: CTE
      scans of 42 consecutive patients (aged 21-78 years, 12 men) were reviewed by a
      single radiologist for technical adequacy and diagnosis. A panel of
      gastroenterologists reviewed clinical information. At a telephone interview,
      tolerance of CTE was graded numerically from 1 (unbearable) to 10 (excellent) and
      descriptively as unbearable, fair, good or excellent. RESULTS: Good or optimal
      distension of small bowel was achieved in 98%. The entire small bowel was imaged 
      in 88%. Eighteen patients had a normal small bowel, whereas 12 (29%) had active
      small bowel Crohn disease, 4 intussusception, 3 small bowel diverticula and 7
      having other diagnoses. Mesenteric lymphadenopathy was evident in 11 and fat
      stranding in 5. CTE resulted in a new or altered diagnosis in 13 (31%) patients
      and identified more extensive Crohn disease in a further 8 (19%). A change in
      management plan was instituted in 18 (43%) patients, with subsequent clinically
      significant improvement in 12. 33 (85%) described the procedure as 'fair' or
      'unbearable' rather than 'good' or 'excellent'. The median tolerance score was 3 
      out of 10. CONCLUSION: CTE provided high-quality images in nearly all patients
      and had an effect on diagnosis, management or outcome in most, but was not well
      tolerated.

TI  - Gut permeability to lactulose and mannitol differs in treated Crohn's disease and
      celiac disease patients and healthy subjects.
PG  - 1105-9
LID - S0100-879X2008001200010 [pii]
AB  - The gut barrier monitors and protects the gastrointestinal tract from challenges 
      such as microorganisms, toxins and proteins that could act as antigens. There is 
      evidence that gut barrier dysfunction may act as a primary disease mechanism in
      intestinal disorders. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the barrier
      function towards sugars after the appropriate treatment of celiac disease and
      Crohn's disease patients and compare the results with those obtained with healthy
      subjects. Fifteen healthy volunteers, 22 celiac disease patients after 1 year of 
      a gluten-free diet, and 31 Crohn's disease patients in remission were submitted
      to an intestinal permeability test with 6.0 g lactulose and 3.0 g mannitol.
      Six-hour urinary lactulose excretion in Crohn's disease patients was
      significantly higher than in both celiac disease patients (0.42 vs 0.15%) and
      healthy controls (0.42 vs 0.07%). Urinary lactulose excretion was significantly
      higher in celiac disease patients than in healthy controls (0.15 vs 0.07%).
      Urinary mannitol excretion in Crohn's disease patients was the same as healthy
      controls (21 vs 21%) and these values were significantly higher than in celiac
      disease patients (10.9%). The lactulose/mannitol ratio was significantly higher
      in Crohn's disease patients in comparison to celiac disease patients (0.021 vs
      0.013) and healthy controls (0.021 vs 0.003) and this ratio was also
      significantly higher in celiac disease patients compared to healthy controls
      (0.013 vs 0.003). In spite of treatment, differences in sugar permeability were
      observed in both disease groups. These differences in the behavior of the sugar
      probes probably reflect different mechanisms for the alterations of intestinal
      permeability.

TI  - [Efficacy of exclusive enteral feeding as primary therapy for paediatric Crohn's 
      disease].
PG  - 506-14
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The primary nutritional therapy (PNT), which consists in the
      administration of exclusive enteral formula feeds (polymeric, semi-elemental or
      elemental formula) for a period of no less than 6-8 weeks, has proven to be
      effective in inducing clinical remission in children with Crohn's disease. The
      clinical remission does not always include histological remission or cure of the 
      mucosa. Faecal calprotectin is closely correlated with endoscopic and
      histological findings but is slightly associated with clinical activity scores.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: An observational prospective study including all patients
      under 14 years of age diagnosed with Crohn's disease between January 2002 and
      October 2007, and who were fed exclusively with polymeric formula (Modulen IBD,
      Nestle, Vevey, Switzerland) during the onset of the disease. Clinical controls
      were carried out (weight, height, body mass index [BMI) and the Paediatric
      Crohn's Disease Activity Index [PCDAI)) and faecal calprotectin was measured at
      the beginning and at weeks 4 and 8 of treatment. The clinical remission was
      defined as having a PCDAI less than or equal to 10. Faecal calprotectin values
      below 50 microg/g faeces were considered as normal. RESULTS: There were 14
      patients (9 males), mean age at diagnosis of 10.74 +/- 2.56 years. At week 4, 71 
      % of patients (10/14) had achieved clinical remission and a decrease in faecal
      calprotectin levels that was not significant. After 8 weeks, 85 % of our patients
      were in clinical remission and faecal calprotectin values had declined
      significantly without reaching normal levels. CONCLUSION: Primary nutritional
      therapy administered over a period of 8 weeks is capable of inducing clinical
      remission and improving the degree of inflammation of the intestinal mucosa.

AB  - The pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) is not fully
      understood. The interaction between intestinal environmental factors of food and 
      intestinal microbes and the immunological system of hosts seems to be an
      important aspect. We have reviewed the relationship of the daily consumption of
      dietary animal meat and fats, dairy products, sugar, and other factors that may
      be linked to the occurrence of CD and UC from the literature and Japanese
      epidemiological data. In the present study, we reviewed the association between
      food and intestinal microbes and other factors contributing to the occurence of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) from epidemiological data and case-control
      studies of IBD in the literature that appeared on Medline, and assessed the
      reports of intestinal microbes involved in the occurrence of IBD. We found
      several papers describing the positive association of animal meat and sweets and 
      sugar with the occurrence of CD and UC. An analysis of Japanese epidemiological
      data suggested that the registered number of patients with CD or UC started to
      increase more than 20 years after an increased daily consumption of dietary
      animal meat and fats, and milk and dairy products, and after a decreased
      consumption of rice. Many studies implied a positive role of intestinal microbes 
      in the occurrence of IBD. Intestinal environmental factors, such as Westernized
      food and intestinal microbes, seem to be involved in the increased occurrence of 
      IBD.

TI  - Effects of a supplementary diet with specially processed cereals in patients with
      short bowel syndrome.
PG  - 1085-93
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0b013e328303c00a [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Short bowel syndrome patients frequently experience impaired
      health-related quality of life. This syndrome is also associated with increased
      costs for the individuals concerned and the community. Intake of specially
      processed cereals has been demonstrated to decrease intestinal secretion. This
      study evaluates the effect of a supplementary diet with specially processed
      cereals compared with nonprocessed cereals. METHODS: This investigation is a
      randomized double-blind, cross-over multicentre prospective study of 26
      intestinal resected out patients, considered as short bowel syndrome patients.
      The patients were divided into groups A or B, in accordance with the first
      allocated treatment. Subgroup analyses of the underlying diagnoses and type of
      surgical procedure were performed. The studied parameters were faecal volume,
      nocturnal stools, abdominal pain/discomfort, health-related quality of life,
      peripheral blood tests and anthropometric data. RESULTS: In both groups, intake
      of nonprocessed cereals significantly decreased the faecal volume. The subgroup
      analyses of patients with a history of ulcerative colitis (compared with Crohn's 
      disease) and nonileostomy-operated procedure (compared with ileostomi-operated
      procedure) showed significantly decreased faecal volume during nonprocessed
      cereals intake. Peripheral blood tests, quality of life and anthropometry were
      not affected. CONCLUSION: In this study, nonprocessed cereals seemed to be as
      effective as specially processed cereals in decreasing faecal volume in general
      and especially in ulcerative colitis patients (mainly operated with nonileostomy 
      techniques). Our results indicate that use of supplementary cereals is safe for
      this group of patients, but should optimally include evaluation of the underlying
      diagnosis and the surgical method used.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) can cause metabolic 
      and inflammatory alterations. AIM: To evaluate the relationships between
      inflammatory parameters, plasma lipids and phospholipid fatty acid (FA)
      composition in patients with active UC and CD. METHODS: Diet, the Harvey-Bradshaw
      Activity Index (HBAI), inflammatory parameters, lipoproteins and FA composition
      were assessed in 60 CD and 34 UC. RESULTS: No differences in clinical parameters 
      were observed in the two groups. Total cholesterol correlated inversely with the 
      number of bowel movements in both groups and directly with BMI in UC. Arachidonic
      acid correlated inversely with HBAI in UC and total and HDL cholesterol were
      inversely related to C-reactive protein (CRP) in CD while HDL correlated with CRP
      in UC. Docosapentaenoic acid was the only polyunsaturated n-3 FA that was
      correlated to CRP in both groups. Total cholesterol was independently associated 
      in the multiple regression analysis with the number of bowel movements and
      systemic inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Total and LDL cholesterol were lower in the
      active UC and CD than in the healthy subjects and were correlated with the
      systemic inflammatory status. Phospholipid FA composition was correlated to the
      systemic inflammatory status, but was unrelated to dietary intake and intestinal 
      disease activity.

TI  - Tissue transglutaminase antibodies in individuals with celiac disease bind to
      thyroid follicles and extracellular matrix and may contribute to thyroid
      dysfunction.
PG  - 1171-8
LID - 10.1089/thy.2008.0110 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals with active celiac disease (CD+) have an increased
      incidence of thyroid dysfunction, which improves on a gluten-free diet (CD-). We 
      investigated whether tissue transglutaminase-2 IgA antibodies (anti-TGase II)
      present in sera of patients with celiac disease react with thyroid tissue and
      possibly contribute to thyroid disease. METHODS: Serum from 40 active celiac
      patients taken before a gluten-free diet (CD+), 46 patients on a gluten-free diet
      (CD-), 40 normal controls (NC), and 25 with Crohn's disease (CROHN) was used. All
      sera were screened for antithyroperoxidase antibodies (TPO-AB) and thyroglobulin 
      antibodies (TG-AB), and indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) was performed on
      primate thyroid tissue sections using TPO-AB- and TG-AB-negative sera. RESULTS:
      IIF with thyroid seronegative, anti-TGase II-positive CD+ sera (n = 23)
      demonstrated staining of thyroid follicular cells and extracellular matrix, in an
      identical pattern with monoclonal anti-human TGase II antibody. Evidence of TGase
      II as the antigen in thyroid tissue was supported by elimination of the IIF
      pattern when sera were depleted of anti-TGase II by pretreatment with human
      recombinant TGase II. No staining of thyroid tissue was observed when sera from
      CD+ patients that were negative for TGase II antibodies, or sera from NC subjects
      were used. Thyroid antibodies were found in 43% of CD+ patients, significantly
      higher than NC and CROHN patients (p < 0.0001). In addition, a positive
      correlation was observed between anti-TGase II and TPO-AB titers (p = 0.0001; r =
      0.63). CONCLUSIONS: Anti-TGase II antibodies bind to TGase II in thyroid tissue, 
      and titers correlate with TPO antibody titers. These findings suggest that
      anti-TGase II antibodies could contribute to the development of thyroid disease
      in celiac disease.

TI  - Effects of infliximab and parenteral nutrition on albumin and fibrinogen
      synthesis rates in pediatric Crohn disease.
PG  - 579-84
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) may play a significant role
      in growth disturbance in pediatric Crohn disease. The aim of this study was to
      determine the effects of anti-TNF-alpha therapy on albumin and fibrinogen
      synthesis during both fasting and parenteral nutrition infusion in pediatric
      patients with active Crohn disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children with active
      Crohn disease scheduled for their initial dose of infliximab underwent assessment
      immediately before and 2 weeks following infliximab infusion. Using the stable
      isotope [d5] phenylalanine, rates of fractional and absolute albumin and
      fibrinogen synthesis were calculated. Measurements were made in both the fasting 
      and parenterally fed states. RESULTS: Fifteen children (mean age 14.9 +/- 0.3)
      completed the study. The mean serum albumin changed from 3.59 +/- 0.08 to 3.66
      +/- 0.04 g/dL, and the mean fibrinogen level decreased from 230 +/- 17 to 187 +/-
      8 mg/dL (P < 0.05) following infliximab therapy. During fasting, there were no
      changes in albumin and fibrinogen synthesis rates following infliximab. During
      parenteral nutrition infusion, the fractional albumin synthesis rate changed from
      11.8% to 15.1%/day (P = 0.06), and the absolute albumin synthesis rate increased 
      from 192 to 248 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) (P < 0.05), whereas no changes in
      fibrinogen synthesis rates were observed. Synthesis rates of albumin and
      fibrinogen were increased during parenteral nutrition infusion compared with the 
      fasting state. CONCLUSIONS: Following infliximab therapy, during parenteral
      nutrition infusion, albumin synthesis increased significantly. Conversely, serum 
      fibrinogen levels decreased following infliximab therapy in the absence of
      significant change in synthesis rates.

TI  - Malnutrition in inflammatory bowel disease patients in northern India: frequency 
      and factors influencing its development.
PG  - 95-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are often under
      nourished. Though there are several studies evaluating nutrition in patients with
      IBD from the developed world, the data from developing countries are scanty,
      where under nutrition is predominant. METHOD: 62 patients with IBD (55 ulcerative
      colitis [UC] and 7 Crohn's disease [CD] patients) and 42 healthy subjects (HS)
      were evaluated for nutrition using dietary survey, anthropometric and biochemical
      parameters. RESULTS: Of the patients with IBD, 23 (37%) had active disease and 39
      (63%) were in remission. Daily intake of calories (1725 Kcal/d [500-2458] vs.
      2239 Kcal/d [1835-3000], p<0.0001), protein (40 g/d [19-96] vs. 50 g/d [29-73],
      p=0.001) and iron (9 mg/d [1-16] vs. 12 mg/d [9-16], p<0.0001) and anthropometric
      parameters of nutrition such as body mass index (BMI) (19.8 [13.7-27.5] vs. 23
      [17.9-27.2], <0.0001), biceps (0.3 mm [0.1-1.9] vs. 0.5 mm [0.2-1.0], p<0.0001)
      and triceps (0.7 mm [0.2-2.9] vs. 1.2 mm [0.5-2.3], p<0.0001) skin fold thickness
      (BSF, TSF) and mid-arm muscle circumference (MAMC, 25.9 mm [15-35] vs. 26.8 mm
      [23-32] <0.04) were lower among the IBD patients than among the HS. Though
      patients with CD had a lower level of haemoglobin (median 9.2 g vs. 10.8 g,
      respectively; p<0.05) and serum total protein (median 6 g, range 3-7 vs. 7 g,
      range 3-9, respectively; p<0.05), serum albumin, BMI, BSF and TSF thicknesses,
      MAMC and daily intake of protein, calories, calcium and iron were comparable
      between UC and CD patients. Though daily dietary intake was comparable between
      patients with active disease and those in remission yet patients with active
      disease had lower BMI, MAMC and serum protein level. CONCLUSION: Under nutrition 
      is common in patients with IBD, particularly in those with acute exacerbation.

TI  - Quality of life of patients and medical cost of "half elemental diet" as
      maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease: secondary outcomes of a randomised
      controlled trial.
PG  - 390-4
LID - 10.1016/j.dld.2008.09.007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Quality of life (QOL) of the patients and medical costs are
      important in current medical treatments, especially those for chronic diseases.
      We have reported the effectiveness of 'half elemental diet (ED)' as maintenance
      therapy for patients with Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this study was to
      evaluate the QOL of CD patients and medical costs of half-ED. METHODS: Fifty-one 
      CD patients in remission were randomly assigned to a half-ED group (n=26) or a
      free diet group (n=25). The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of relapse
      during a 2-year period. This time, we investigated the QOL of the patients and
      medical costs of half-ED, as secondary outcomes. QOL was evaluated using the
      Japanese version of the IBDQ scoring system, and medical costs were calculated
      monthly from the receipts. RESULTS: IBDQ score was not significantly different
      between the two groups at 1 and 13 months after the start of maintenance
      treatment. Medical costs were not significantly different between them either.
      This study showed that half-ED therapy did not affect the treatment of CD
      patients, neither regarding their QOL nor medical costs. CONCLUSION: This study
      has confirmed this half-ED therapy is beneficial for patients with Crohn's
      disease.

PG  - 75-82
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2008.03860.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analyses
      are powerful tools to assess the diversity of complex microbiota. T-RFLPs permit 
      rapid comparisons of microbiota from many samples. AIM: To perform T-RFLP
      analyses of faecal microbiota in Crohn's disease (CD) patients to investigate
      potential alterations in faecal microbial communities and furthermore to analyse 
      the effects of elemental diet on faecal microbiota profiles. METHODS: Thirty-four
      patients with CD and 30 healthy individuals were enrolled in the study. DNA was
      extracted from stool samples and 16S rRNA genes were amplified by PCR. PCR
      products were digested with BslI restriction enzymes and T-RF lengths were
      determined. RESULTS: Faecal microbial communities were classified into seven
      clusters. Almost all healthy individuals (28/30) were included in cluster I, II
      and III, but the majority of CD patients (25/34) could be divided into another
      four clusters (cluster IV-VII). Prediction of bacteria based on the BslI-digested
      T-RFLP database showed a significant decrease in Clostridium cluster IV,
      Clostridium cluster XI and subcluster XIVa in CD patients. In contrast,
      Bacteroides significantly increased in CD patients. Significant increases in
      Enterobacteriales were also observed in CD patients. Furthermore, elemental diets
      modulated faecal bacterial communities in CD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Terminal
      restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses showed that the diversity of
      faecal microbiota in patients with CD differed from that of healthy individuals. 
      Furthermore, elemental diets modulated faecal microbiota composition, and this
      effect may be involved in mechanisms of clinical effects of elemental diet.

TI  - High prevalence of vitamin K and D deficiency and decreased BMD in inflammatory
      bowel disease.
PG  - 935-42
LID - 10.1007/s00198-008-0764-2 [doi]
AB  - SUMMARY: Vitamin K and D deficiency and decreased bone mineral density (BMD) were
      highly prevalent in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially
      Crohn's disease (CD). Dietary intakes of these vitamins, however, were above the 
      Japanese adequate intakes in IBD patients, suggesting that malabsorption is the
      basis for hypovitaminosis K and D and decreased BMD. INTRODUCTION: We have
      studied the possible involvement of vitamin K and D deficiency in the
      pathogenesis of decreased BMD in IBD. METHODS: Seventy patients with IBD were
      evaluated for their BMD; plasma levels of vitamin K; phylloquinone (PK),
      menaquinone-7 (MK-7), and 25OH-D; serum PTH, protein induced by vitamin K absence
      (PIVKA-II), and undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) levels; and their food
      intake. RESULTS: Compared with ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, CD patients had 
      significantly lower plasma vitamin K and 25OH-D concentrations; significantly
      higher serum levels of PTH, PIVKA-II, and ucOC; and significantly lower BMD
      scores at almost all measurement sites. More IBD patients were vitamin K
      deficient in bone than in liver. Multiple regression analyses revealed that low
      plasma concentrations of vitamin K and 25OH-D were independent risk factors for
      low BMD and that they were associated with the patients' fat intake, but not with
      their intake of these vitamins. CONCLUSION: IBD patients have high prevalence of 
      decreased BMD and vitamin K and D deficiency probably caused by malabsorption of 
      these vitamins.

TI  - Evaluation of bone mineral density among patients with inflammatory bowel disease
      in a tertiary care setting in India.
PG  - 103-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have low bone mineral 
      density (BMD). Dietary calcium is important for them in the prevention of
      osteopenia and osteoporosis. There are no reports on the status of BMD in Indian 
      patients with IBD. METHODS: Dietary calcium intake and cumulative steroid and
      immunosuppressive drug use was noted in 46 randomly selected patients (mean [SD] 
      age 40.5 [14.7] years; 28 men) with IBD (ulcerative colitis 22, Crohn's disease
      24). To compare values of BMD for patients, data from 46 age- and sex-matched
      healthy controls (age 40.5 [14.6] years; 28 men) were selected from an existing
      database of healthy Indian volunteers whose BMD had been measured in a
      community-based survey carried out among people residing in Delhi (unpublished
      data). BMD was measured using DXA (Hologic QDR 4500). Osteopenia and osteoporosis
      were defined as per the standard WHO criteria. RESULTS: The mean duration of
      disease was 87.7 (78.3) months. The mean calcium intake by 41 patients (89.1%)
      was <200 mg/day, by 2 patients (4.3%) 200-400 mg/day and by 3 patients (6.4%)>400
      mg/day. Significantly lower values of BMD at the spine and hip regions were seen 
      in patients with both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease as compared with
      Indian healthy controls. In comparison to age- and sex-matched healthy controls, 
      29 (63%) and 21 (45.6%) patients had either osteopenia or osteoporosis at the
      spine and hip region, respectively. Of them, 4 and 7 patients had osteoporosis at
      the spine and hip region, respectively. There was no correlation between values
      of BMD and the age of patient, duration of disease, and cumulative steroid dose. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Two thirds of Indian patients with IBD have low BMD. Since the
      intake of dietary calcium is inadequate in a majority of these patients, they
      should be advised to increase the intake of dairy products.

TI  - Nutritional supplementation with polymeric diet enriched with transforming growth
      factor-beta 2 for children with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 503-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: A polymeric diet rich in transforming growth factor-beta 2 used as a 
      single nutrient has been shown to induce remission in 79% of children with
      Crohn's disease. OBJECTIVES: To summarize the experience of several pediatric
      gastroenterology units in Israel using a TGFbeta2-enriched polymeric diet
      (Modulen IBD) supplementation in children and adolescents with Crohn's disease.
      METHODS: In a retrospective study we reviewed the charts of 28 children with
      Crohn's disease (10 girls, 18 boys) who received, in addition to conventional
      treatment, Modulen IBD as a supplement to their regular nutrition. These children
      were compared with 18 children supplemented with standard polymeric formula
      (Ensure Plus) and 18 children without formula supplementation. We recorded
      clinical manifestations, growth, and the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index
      before and after initiation of the polymeric diet. RESULTS: The Modulen-treated
      children showed a significant decrease in PCDAI from 34.3 to 15.7 (P< 0.0001). A 
      significant decrease in PCDAI was recorded also in the Ensure Plus group, from 35
      to 22 (P= 0.02) but not in the non-supplemented group. Significant improvements
      in body mass index (P = 0.01) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P= 0.03) were
      recorded at follow-up (median 3.4 months) only in the Modulen IBD group.
      CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of children with Crohn's disease, supplementation of 
      the diet with Modulen IBD as well as supplementation with Ensure Plus was
      associated with a decrease in PCDAI. The children supplemented with Modulen IBD
      also showed improvement in BMI, suggesting an additional advantage of nutritional
      therapy in children with this disease.

      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 673-6
LID - 10.1203/PDR.0b013e318186dde2 [doi]
AB  - Improvements in insulin resistance after anti-TNF-alpha therapy have been
      reported in inflammatory conditions, although no changes were noted in adult
      patients with Crohn's disease. There is no information concerning insulin
      resistance and substrate metabolism in children with Crohn's disease after
      anti-TNF-alpha therapy. Our aim was to describe changes in carbohydrate and lipid
      metabolism in children with active Crohn's disease after their initial dose of
      infliximab. Children with active Crohn's disease underwent measurement of plasma 
      insulin and glucose just before and 2 wk after their initial infusion of
      infliximab, an anti-TNF-alpha antibody. In addition, resting energy expenditure, 
      with determination of both carbohydrate and lipid oxidation rates, was
      determined. Measurements were conducted in both fasting and parenterally fed
      states. Despite no changes in resting energy expenditure, a significant reduction
      (p < 0.05) in RQ (5%) and carbohydrate oxidation rate (24%), with a corresponding
      increase in lipid oxidation rate (42%) was found during parenteral nutrition
      infusion. No differences in plasma insulin, glucose, and insulin resistance were 
      noted when comparing pre- and postinfliximab measurements.

TI  - Nutritional therapy for active Crohn's disease.
PG  - 4420-3
AB  - Nutritional therapy for active Crohn's disease (CD) is an underutilised form of
      treatment in adult patients, though its use is common in the paediatric
      population. There is evidence that nutritional therapy can effectively induce
      remission of CD in adult patients. Enteral nutrition therapy is safe and
      generally well tolerated. Meta-analysis data suggest that corticosteroids are
      superior to nutritional treatment for induction of remission in active CD.
      However, the potential side effects of such pharmacotherapy must be taken into
      consideration. This review examines the evidence for the efficacy of elemental
      and polymeric diets, and the use of total parenteral nutrition in active CD.

TI  - Surgical management and outcomes of patients with duodenal Crohn's disease.
PG  - 36-42
LID - 10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2007.12.049 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Duodenal Crohn's disease (DCD) has been reported to occur in 0.5% to 
      4% of patients with Crohn's disease. When patients fail to respond to
      conservative therapy or severe narrowing of the duodenum develops, operation is
      required. The recent literature is limited in description of surgical treatment
      of such patients. We reviewed our experience with surgical management and
      outcomes in patients with DCD, including outcomes of laparoscopic bypass
      procedures. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review was undertaken of all patients
      who underwent surgical intervention for DCD between 1995 and 2006. Data collected
      included demographics, clinical presentation, operative and hospital course, and 
      postoperative followup. RESULTS: Thirty patients had surgical intervention for
      DCD during the selected period. Four patients had duodenoenteric fistulas,
      resulting from complications of their disease in the distal gastrointestinal
      tract. Operations done for intrinsic DCD were: open bypass (n = 11), laparoscopic
      bypass (n = 13), and stricturoplasty (n = 2). Only one vagotomy was done. Mean
      followup was 58 months (range 6 to 144 months). Patients resumed oral diet 3.0
      days after laparoscopic bypass, with mean discharge of 6.9 days, as compared with
      4.4 days and 12.2 days after open bypass, respectively. In the early
      postoperative period (0 to 30 days), six major complications (n=5, 19%):
      persistent obstruction, anastomotic leak, small bowel obstruction, anastomotic
      bleeding (two patients), and respiratory failure, developed in four patients in
      the open (36%) and one patient in the laparoscopic (8%) bypass group. There were 
      two more complications during longterm followup, for an overall major morbidity
      rate of 27%. Two patients experienced recurrence requiring revision (one in the
      open group and one in the laparoscopic group). Gastroduodenal ulcers requiring
      operation did not develop in any of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Surgery is a
      viable and safe option for patients with intractable duodenal Crohn's disease.
      The laparoscopic approach during a bypass procedure, as opposed to an open
      bypass, may result in faster recovery, less morbidity, and comparable recurrence 
      rate. There is no role for vagotomy in bypass procedures.

PG  - 149-55
LID - 10.1007/s00431-008-0721-2 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is uncommon in children younger than 2 years of 
      age. The criteria for differentiating IBD from other diseases with similar
      clinical presentation is unclear. We describe 16 patients who, between 1984 and
      2004, received a histological diagnosis of IBD during the first two years of
      life. Six patients presented with histological Crohn's disease, eight with
      ulcerative colitis and two with indeterminate colitis. The median age at
      diagnosis was 125 days (range 1 day to 18 months) and the medium follow up was 89
      months (range 65 days to 20 years). The disease appeared to be very severe: four 
      children (25%) underwent total parenteral nutrition (TPN), two received colectomy
      (12.5%) and three patients died. Many of the patients required an aggressive,
      multidrug, immunosuppressive approach (azathioprine [AZA], Infliximab,
      thalidomide, cyclosporine A). One child presented with a hypogammaglobulinaemia
      without any specific immunodeficiency, while in the other patients,
      Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) (4 cases) and chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) 
      (2 cases) were identified. In 6/16 cases, allergic colitis was first considered; 
      these cases initially underwent cow's milk protein-free diet as the only therapy 
      before IBD was finally diagnosed. In conclusion, early IBD has a severe prognosis
      and often needs an aggressive therapeutic approach. Furthermore, an improper
      diagnosis of allergic colitis might cause an important diagnostic delay. Some
      severe immunodeficiencies, such as WAS and CGD, may represent a problem in terms 
      of differential diagnosis and might be wrongly diagnosed as very early onset IBD.

TI  - Metabolic and nutritional features in adult celiac patients.
PG  - 128-33
LID - 10.1159/000116770 [doi]
AB  - Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic immune-mediated gluten-dependent enteropathy
      induced by ingestion of gluten-containing products, characterized by intestinal
      malabsorption and subtotal or total atrophy of intestinal villi, which improves
      after gluten-free diet (GFD). Untreated patients affected by the classic form of 
      CD are at high risk of malnutrition, but an impairment of nutritional status is
      frequently reported also in patients with the subclinical form of the disease.
      Strict adherence to a GFD greatly improves nutritional status, inducing an
      increase in fat and bone compartments, but does not completely normalize body
      composition. A lack of improvement in nutritional status may identify incomplete 
      adherence to GFD treatment. Evidence has shown lower body weights and lower fat
      mass and fat-free mass contents in CD patients. Untreated CD patients oxidize
      more carbohydrates as energy substrate compared to treated subjects. In addition,
      circulating ghrelin concentration was reduced after GFD treatment as a possible
      consequence of body composition improvement, while leptin did not correlate with 
      the changes in body composition and substrate oxidation in patients with CD. A
      significant correlation was reported between ghrelin and the degree of severity
      of intestinal mucosal lesions. CD patients might show an alteration in lipid
      metabolism, i.e. low serum total and high- density lipoprotein-cholesterol as a
      consequence of lipid malabsorption and decreased intake. In conclusion, weight
      loss and nutritional deficiencies are relevant clinical features in CD. Thus, an 
      early and accurate evaluation of nutritional status and energy metabolism
      represents a fundamental tool in the management of CD patients.

TI  - Treatment of diarrhea in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: concepts and
      cautions.
PG  - S3-10
AB  - Diarrhea continues to be a prevalent symptom in patients with inflammatory bowel 
      disease (IBD), requiring a wide differential diagnosis to define the
      pathophysiologic mechanisms in individual patients. It is essential that
      physicians properly evaluate complaints of diarrhea by assessing both patient
      symptoms and potential physiologic impacts on fluid and electrolyte status.
      Underlying mechanisms of diarrhea with IBD are the location, extent, and severity
      of inflammation; malabsorption; altered motility; and iatrogenic causes such as
      medications, diet, and antibiotic-associated colitis (eg, Clostridium difficile).
      When treating diarrhea, physicians need to control inflammatory activity using
      appropriate treatment algorithms. Therapies include aminosalicylates,
      corticosteroids, immune modifiers, and, most recently, biologic treatment. Other 
      medications, including loperamide, diphenoxylate, codeine sulfate, and tinctures 
      of opium, slow motility and increase the absorption of fluids and nutrients. For 
      iatrogenic issues, medications that cause diarrhea should be withdrawn and
      individual diets modified. Not all diarrheas in the IBD patient are the same;
      therefore, it is essential to tailor therapies according to presumed etiologies. 
      Antidiarrheal agents are not recommended in extremely ill patients and those with
      known hypersensitivity or evidence of obstruction or colonic dilation, fever, or 
      abdominal tenderness. Concomitant use of loperamide with diphenoxylate and
      atropine should be avoided in early pregnancy.

TI  - Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies in acute myocardial infarction.
PG  - 444-9
LID - 10.2310/6650.2007.00024 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Elevated anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA) immunoglobulin
      (IgG) and IgA levels were first described in the serum of Crohn disease patients 
      and have increasingly been reported in other inflammatory diseases. The role of
      in situ and remote inflammation in atherosclerosis is a major area of interest.
      In this study, we compared ASCA IgG and IgA levels in acute myocardial infarction
      (AMI) and controls to investigate the possible role of ASCA in AMI. METHODS:
      Serum samples were obtained from 140 consecutive patients who presented to the
      emergency department with acute chest pain. AMI was diagnosed by
      electrocardiography and serial enzymes. Patients ruled out for acute coronary
      event were grouped as controls. ASCA IgA and IgG levels were determined using
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Groups were compared for statistically
      significant difference. RESULTS: ASCA IgG titers ranged between 0.1 and 31.0
      RIU/mL (mean 4.92) in the AMI group and 0.1 and 6.0 (mean 0.84) in the controls. 
      The groups were found to differ very significantly (p = .001). ASCA IgA titers
      ranged between 2.0 and 200.0 RIU/mL (mean 13.73) in the AMI group and 2.0 and
      11.5 RIU/mL, (mean 4.25) in controls. The groups differed significantly (p =
      .32). AMI and controls were also analyzed for ASCA IgA and IgG positivity. Both
      groups differed significantly from controls (p = .013). CONCLUSION: Elevated ASCA
      IgA and IgG levels as well as ASCA positivity in the AMI might suggest use of
      ASCA as a marker for atherosclerotic plaque instability. It might also provide a 
      link between inflammatory processes and increased cardiovascular risk. Further
      studies are needed on a Saccharomyces cerevisiae-based diet, related intestinal
      colonization, and associated inflammation, autoimmune disorders, and
      cardiovascular events.

TI  - Dietary patterns and risk for Crohn's disease in children.
PG  - 367-73
AB  - BACKGROUND: Some dietary foods are considered protective (vegetables and fruits),
      whereas others (fatty foods) are thought to enhance the risk for Crohn's disease 
      (CD). The evidence, however, is inconsistent. METHODS: We postulated that
      specific dietary patterns may influence the risk for CD. A case-control study was
      carried out. Newly diagnosed CD cases with population and/or hospital-based
      controls < or =20 years were selected from 3 tertiary hospitals across Canada.
      Pre-disease diet was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire
      (FFQ) administered within 1 month of diagnosis. Factor analyses and unconditional
      logistic regression (adjusted) was used to determine gender-specific dietary
      patterns and assess associated risks for CD. Odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 
      95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated. RESULTS: A total of 149 cases 
      and 251 controls were included. The mean age (range) of the cases was 13.3
      (2.6-20 years). There were more boys (61.1%). Four dietary patterns each were
      observed among both boys and girls. Pattern 1 in girls, characterized by meats,
      fatty foods, and desserts, was positively associated with CD (OR 4.7, 95% CI
      1.6-14.2). Pattern 2, common to both boys and girls, was characterized by
      vegetables, fruits, olive oil, fish, grains, and nuts and was inversely
      associated with CD in both genders (girls: OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.9; boys: OR 0.2, 
      95% CI 0.1-0.5). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that specific dietary patterns 
      could be associated with higher or lower risks for CD in children. Larger
      prospective studies are required to confirm these findings.

TI  - Dietary microparticles and their impact on tolerance and immune responsiveness of
      the gastrointestinal tract.
PG  - S59-63
AB  - Dietary microparticles are non-biological bacterial-sized particles of the
      gastrointestinal lumen that occur due to endogenous formation (calcium phosphate)
      or following oral exposure (exogenous microparticle). In the UK, about 40 mg
      (10(12)) of exogenous microparticles are ingested per person per day, through
      exposure to food additives, pharmaceutical/supplement excipients or toothpaste
      constituents. Once ingested, exogenous microparticles are unlikely to pass
      through the gastrointestinal tract without adsorbing to their surfaces some ions 
      and molecules of the intestinal lumen. Both entropy and ionic attraction drive
      such interactions. Calcium ions are especially well adsorbed by dietary
      microparticles which then provide a positively charged surface for the attraction
      (adsorption) of other organic molecules such as lipopolysaccharides,
      peptidoglycans or protein antigen from the diet or commensal flora. The major
      (but not only) sites of microparticle entry into intestinal tissue are the M-cell
      rich lymphoid aggregates (termed Peyer's patches in the small bowel). Indeed, it 
      is well established that this is an efficient transport route for non-biological 
      microparticles although it is unclear why. We hypothesise that this pathway
      exists for "endogenous microparticles" of calcium phosphate, with immunological
      and physiological benefit, and that "exogenous dietary microparticles", such as
      titanium dioxide and the silicates, hijack this route. This overview focuses on
      what is known of these microparticles and outlines their potential role in immune
      tolerance of the gut (endogenous microparticles) or immune activation (exogenous 
      microparticles) and inflammation of the gut.

TI  - Ingested matter affects intestinal lesions in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 374-82
AB  - BACKGROUND: Environmental factors of the modern Western lifestyle may trigger
      Crohn's disease (CD) in susceptible individuals. Because such factors could be
      part of ingested matter, we intended to improve intestinal Crohn's lesions by
      exclusion thereof. METHODS: At first we tested a highly restricted diet (based on
      spelt bread and red meat, both derived from intensively monitored organic
      farming) in 5 pilot cases. In a subsequent controlled trial, 18 patients with
      mild-to-moderate CD were randomly assigned to receive either this active diet or 
      a control diet (low-fiber, low-fat, and high-carbohydrate). Mucosal improvement
      was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and endoscopy. Secondary
      endpoints included sonography, the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI), and the
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ). RESULTS: Four of 5 pilot
      patients showed significant improvement within 4 weeks. From 18 patients in the
      controlled trial, 8 were randomized to the active and 10 to the control group; 4 
      decided to quit immediately after dietary counseling, 3 in the active and 1 in
      the control group (P = 0.183). At 6 weeks MRI and endoscopy showed improvement of
      intestinal lesions in 3 of 4 assessable patients of the active group and 1 of 9
      patients of the control group (P = 0.027). Sonography showed improvement in 4 of 
      5 patients of the active group and in 1 of 8 assessable patients of the control
      group (P = 0.016). CDAI and IBDQ improved in both groups to a similar extent.
      CONCLUSIONS: Ingested matter as part of the modern Western lifestyle may cause
      persistence of intestinal Crohn's lesions.

TI  - Nutrigenomics in the whole-genome scanning era: Crohn's disease as example.
PG  - 3105-18
AB  - Nutrigenomics has the potential to tailor diets to optimize health, based on
      knowledge of key genetic polymorphisms. Identification of candidate genes is
      often based on a priori knowledge of disease processes. However, genome-wide
      association methods are not only validating previously identified genes and
      polymorphisms, but also revealing new gene-disease associations not anticipated
      from prior knowledge. In Crohn's disease (CD), such studies not only confirm the 
      importance of caspase-activated recruitment domain 15 and major
      histocompatibility complex II molecules, but also reveal strong associations with
      the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-23 receptor and autophagy-related
      16-like gene. Genes identified to date in CD can be linked into two interrelated 
      pathways: receptor-mediated cytokine induction or autophagocytosis. New genomic
      technologies need to be matched with innovative methodologies to characterize the
      likely impact of foods and to take the field to another dimension of value for
      human diet development and optimized health.

TI  - Impacts of long-term enteral nutrition on clinical and endoscopic disease
      activities and mucosal cytokines during remission in patients with Crohn's
      disease: a prospective study.
PG  - 1493-501
AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term enteral nutrition may maintain clinical and endoscopic
      remission in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this prospective
      study was to investigate the impacts of long-term enteral nutrition on clinical
      and endoscopic disease activities and mucosal tissue cytokines in patients with
      quiescent CD. METHODS: Forty patients with CD who achieved clinical remission
      were included. Of these, 20 received continuous elemental diet (Elental) infusion
      during the nighttime and a low-fat diet during the daytime (EN group) and 20
      received neither nutritional therapy nor food restriction (non-EN group). With
      these regimens, all 40 patients were monitored for 1 year. Further,
      ileocolonoscopy was performed at entry, at 6 and 12 months, and mucosal biopsies 
      were taken for cytokine assays. RESULTS: On an intention-to-treat basis, 5
      patients (25%) in the EN group and 13 (65%) in the non-EN group had a clinical
      relapse during the 1-year observation (P = 0.03). The mean endoscopic
      inflammation (EI) scores were not significantly different between the groups at
      both entry and 6 months, but at 12 months EI scores were significantly higher in 
      the non-EN group than in the EN group (P = 0.04). Additionally, the mucosal
      tissue interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha levels
      significantly increased with time in the non-EN group (entry versus 12 months,
      IL-1beta, P = 0.02; IL-6, P = 0.002; TNF-alpha, P = 0.001). In the EN group these
      cytokines did not show a significant increase. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term enteral
      nutrition in patients with quiescent CD has a clear suppressive effect on
      clinical and endoscopic disease activities and the mucosal inflammatory cytokine 
      levels.

TI  - Dietary microparticles implicated in Crohn's disease can impair macrophage
      phagocytic activity and act as adjuvants in the presence of bacterial stimuli.
PG  - 353-61
AB  - OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: Western diets regularly expose the gastrointestinal tract
      (GI) to large quantities ( > 10(12)/day) of man-made, submicron-sized, particles 
      derived from food additives and excipients. These are taken up by M cells,
      accumulate in gut macrophages, and may influence the aetiology of inflammatory
      bowel diseases (IBD). MATERIALS: We investigated the effects of common dietary
      microparticles on the function of macrophages from healthy donors or active
      Crohn's disease (CD) patients. METHODS: Macrophages were incubated for 24 h with 
      microparticles before being assayed for cytokine production and phagocytic
      activity. RESULTS: Microparticles alone were non-stimulatory but, in the presence
      of bacterial antigens such as LPS, they could act as adjuvants to induce potent
      cytokine responses. Uptake of high concentrations of microparticles also impaired
      macrophage phagocytic capacity - but not their ability - to take up 2microM
      fluorescent beads. CONCLUSIONS: While dietary microparticles alone have limited
      effects on basic macrophage functions, their ability to act as adjuvants could
      aggravate ongoing inflammatory responses towards bacterial antigens in the GI
      tract.

TI  - Adequacy of nutritional intake in a Canadian population of patients with Crohn's 
      disease.
PG  - 1575-80
AB  - Crohn's disease is frequently associated with nutritional deficiencies, often a
      result of disease activity and poor oral intake. This study investigated the
      adequacy of dietary intake, based on the Canadian Dietary Reference Intake, in
      ambulatory patients with Crohn's disease and a normal body mass index (BMI;
      calculated as kg/m(2)). This was a cross-sectional study of 74 patients with mean
      age of 35.7+/-1.4 years and BMI of 23.05+/-0.45. All patients completed a 7-day
      food record and a diary for the Crohn's Disease Activity Index. Mean Crohn's
      Disease Activity Index was 138.99+/-11.38. Energy and protein intakes were within
      the recommended levels of intake, but total carbohydrates, fat, and saturated fat
      intake exceeded the recommended levels of <55%, <35%, and <10% in 39.2%, 27%, and
      59.5% of the patients, respectively. Micronutrient intakes were suboptimal most
      notably for folate, vitamins C, E, and calcium. There were no substantial
      differences between patients with active and inactive disease in terms of failure
      to meet the Dietary Reference Intake. In conclusion, in this population sample, a
      large number of ambulatory patients with Crohn's disease have suboptimal dietary 
      patterns despite a normal BMI and inactive disease. Dietary counseling and
      supplementation may be warranted in this patient population.

TI  - A comprehensive approach to evaluate nutritional status in Crohn's patients in
      the era of biologic therapy: a case-control study.
PG  - 2551-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the nutritional status of patients with inactive or mildly
      active Crohn's disease (CD), and identify possible causes for potential
      deficiencies. METHODS: A total of 78 CD patients and 80 healthy controls were
      evaluated in respect of nutritional status, dietary intake, and life styles
      factors. RESULTS: These 73/78 CD patients were on immunomodulating therapies.
      Mean body mass index (BMI) was lower in patients as compared to controls (P=
      0.006) but 32% of CD patients and 33.8% of controls had a BMI > 25, whereas 8%
      and 23.8% in each group, respectively, were obese (BMI > 30Kg/m(2)). Fat free
      mass was significantly decreased in both genders (P < 0.05) whereas fat mass was 
      decreased only in males (P= 0.01). Energy intake was significantly lower in CD
      patients (P < 0.0001) and we observed significantly lower adjusted mean daily
      intakes of carbohydrates, monounsaturated fat, fiber, calcium, and vitamins C, D,
      E, and K (P < 0.05). 29% of patients had excluded grains from their usual diet,
      28% milk, 18% vegetables, and 11% fruits. Milk exclusion resulted in a
      significantly lower consumption of calcium and vitamin K (P < 0.001) and the
      exclusion of vegetables was associated to a lower consumption of vitamins C and E
      (P < 0.05). Physical activity was significantly lower in CD patients (P= 0.01)
      and this lack of physical activity was inversely correlated with increased fat
      mass percentage (r=-0.315, P= 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Results showed that the most
      prevalent form of malnutrition in CD patients was an excess of body weight, which
      was concomitant with an inadequate dietary intake, namely micronutrients, clearly
      related to dietary exclusion of certain foods.

TI  - Crohn's disease: a patient's perspective.
PG  - 1437-44
AB  - AIM: As healthcare providers for Crohn's disease, we assume that we have a good
      understanding of the disease progression and its symptoms. The aim of this study 
      was to gather information about what patients with Crohn's disease think are
      relevant to their symptoms and what helps them cope with this lifelong benign
      disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to all patients with a
      diagnosis of Crohn's disease seen in the Digestive Disease Center in the last 5
      years. The returned forms were downloaded into a database and sent for analysis. 
      RESULTS: Sixty-two percent of respondents were female. One third were between the
      ages of 35 and 50 years. Seventy percent were married. Thirty-eight percent had a
      graduate degree, 19% were unemployed. Fifty percent still smoked, half of them
      less than one pack a day. Sixty-eight percent said that their symptoms affected
      work, and one fourth changed jobs due to this. Foods worsened symptoms in 60%,
      with a decrease in symptoms while on low fiber foods and white meats. Lifestyle
      change worsened symptoms in 66%. A change in the caregiver was not a significant 
      stressor. More than half used Remicade, with one third stating that it was
      helpful. Eight percent had never used steroids. Alcohol increased symptoms in
      40%. Factors that did not cause a significant change were children at any age,
      pregnancy, menopause, and hormone replacement therapy. Surgery caused half the
      patients to improve for many years, although one third felt a lowered self-esteem
      postoperatively. CONCLUSION: Patients with Crohn's disease should be managed in a
      more comprehensive manner to provide optimal care. Thus, a team approach that
      includes a dietician and counselor should be considered as an integral part of
      this team. This will allow patients to have enhanced skills to cope with changes 
      in their symptoms, whether they are due to the disease itself or the changes in
      their routine.

PG  - 611-3
AB  - Noncalculous ureteral obstructions in Crohn's disease are often asymptomatic and 
      unidentified. Occurring in about 3% of patients, they occur on the right side in 
      more than 70% of cases, because of frequently associated ileocecal disease. If
      they are associated with inflammation or fibrosis of retroperitoneal periureteral
      fat nephrectomy may become necessary. Conservative treatment should be considered
      first, with urine drainage (ureteral stent, or percutaneous nephrostomy), diet,
      and corticotherapy. However bowel resection is often necessary during follow up. 
      If this fails to cure the ureteral obstruction, ureterolysis should be performed.
      We report the case of a 32 year old woman with noncalculous ureteral obstruction 
      revealing Crohn's disease.

TI  - Enteral nutrition for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease.
PG  - CD005984
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prevention of relapse is a major issue in the management of Crohn's
      disease. Corticosteroids and 5-ASA preparations are not effective for the
      maintenance of remission. Methotrexate, infliximab, 6-mercaptopurine and its
      prodrug, azathioprine may be effective in maintaining remission, but these drugs 
      may cause significant adverse events. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a systematic review 
      to evaluate the efficacy of enteral nutrition for the maintenance of remission in
      Crohn's disease. SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE (1966 to January 2007), EMBASE (1984 to
      January 2007) the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from the
      Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2006) and the IBD/FBD Review Group Specialized Trials 
      Register were searched. The articles cited in each publication were hand
      searched. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials which compared enteral
      nutrition with no intervention, placebo or with any other intervention were
      eligible for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data extraction and
      assessment of methodological quality of included studies were independently
      performed by two authors. The main outcome measure was the occurrence of clinical
      or endoscopic relapse as defined by the primary studies. Odds ratios and 95%
      confidence intervals were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: Two 
      studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria and were included in the 
      review. Statistical pooling of the results of these studies was not possible
      because the control interventions, and the way outcomes were assessed differed
      greatly between the two studies. In one study (Takagi 2006), patients who
      received half of their total daily calorie requirements as elemental diet and the
      remaining half by normal diet had a significantly lower relapse rate compared to 
      patients who received unrestricted normal diet (9 of 26 versus 16 of 25; OR 0.3, 
      95% CI 0.09 to 0.94). In the other study (Verma 2001), elemental and polymeric
      feeds (providing between 35 and 50% of patients' pretrial calorie intake in
      addition to unrestricted normal food) were equally effective for maintenance of
      remission and allowing withdrawal of steroid therapy (8 of 19 versus 6 of 14; OR 
      0.97, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.92). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence suggests
      that supplementary enteral nutritional may be effective for maintenance of
      remission in Crohn's disease. Whilst larger studies are needed to confirm these
      findings, enteral nutritional supplementation could be considered as an
      alternative or as an adjunct to maintenance drug therapy in Crohn's disease.

TI  - Imbalances in dietary consumption of fatty acids, vegetables, and fruits are
      associated with risk for Crohn's disease in children.
PG  - 2016-25
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The role of dietary factors in the etiology of Crohn's
      disease (CD) is inconsistent largely due to difficulties in acquiring valid
      information on consumption habits. We examined the impact of diet on new onset CD
      in children using a validated food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ). METHODOLOGY: A 
      case-control study was carried out. Children < or =20 yr, newly diagnosed with
      CD, were recruited from 3 pediatric gastroenterology clinics across Canada.
      Population or hospital controls were selected matched to cases for time of
      diagnosis (+/-6 months) and area of residence. Dietary consumption 1 yr prior to 
      disease diagnosis was evaluated using a validated FFQ, administered within 1
      month of diagnosis. Conditional logistic regression analysis adjusting for
      potential confounding variables (energy intake, age, gender, body mass index) was
      carried out. RESULTS: A total of 130 CD patients and 202 controls were studied.
      Mean age at diagnosis (+/-SD) was 14.2 (2.7). There were more male patients
      (59%). Comparing the highest to the lowest levels of consumption, higher amounts 
      of vegetables (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.33-1.44, P= 0.03), fruits (OR 0.49, 95% CI
      0.25-0.96, P= 0.02), fish (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.20-1.06, P= 0.02), and dietary fiber
      (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.04-0.37, P < 0.001) protected from CD. Consumption of
      long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (LCN-omega-3) was negatively associated with CD
      (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.19-1.00, P < 0.001). A higher ratio of LCN-omega-3/omega-6
      fatty acids was significantly associated with lower risks for CD (OR 0.32, 95% CI
      0.14-0.71, P= 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that an imbalance in
      consumption of fatty acids, vegetables, and fruits is associated with increased
      risks for CD among Canadian children.

TI  - Moderate dietary temperance effectively prevents relapse of Crohn disease: a
      prospective study of patients in remission.
PG  - 202-10
AB  - The authors examined the influence of diet (dietary fat intake and dietary
      temperance) on relapse of patients with Crohn disease. A 1-year prospective study
      of 76 patients with Crohn disease was conducted. The criterion for eligibility
      was a Crohn Disease Activity Index score of 150 or lower for at least 1 month.
      The primary end point was defined as the relapse-free interval from the baseline 
      until the first relapse. Fat intake was assessed using a validated diet history
      questionnaire. The degree of dietary temperance was assessed using a single-item 
      nominal scale. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the
      influence of diet. Crohn disease relapse was seen in 25 patients (33%), and 47
      patients (62%) remained in continuous remission. A decreased ratio of n-6
      polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) to n-3PUFA (odds ratio = .38; p = .005) was
      associated with a poor prognosis. Dietary temperance also was significantly
      associated with prognosis (p = .014). More moderate dietary temperance decreased 
      the risk of relapse (odds ratio = .22; p = .006). Effective prevention of relapse
      for Crohn disease patients might be achieved through moderate dietary temperance,
      particularly when the disease condition is unstable.

TI  - Does polymeric formula improve adherence to liquid diet therapy in children with 
      active Crohn's disease?
PG  - 767-70
AB  - BACKGROUND: Active Crohn's disease can be treated using liquid diet therapy
      (LDT), but non-adherence may limit success, necessitating corticosteroid therapy.
      Whole-protein polymeric formula (PF) seems to be much more palatable than amino
      acid-based elemental formula (EF) and thus may significantly improve adherence to
      LDT. AIM: To compare adherence to LDT using PF versus EF. METHODS: Success in
      completing a 6-week course of LDT, need for nasogastric tube administration of
      formula and use of LDT for relapses were compared between children presenting
      with active disease and treated with EF (n = 53) and children given PF (n = 45). 
      RESULTS: Remission rates were similar (EF 64%, 95% CI 51 to 77 vs PF 51%, 95% CI 
      37 to 66; p>0.15). 72% (95% CI 60 to 84) given EF completed the initial course of
      LDT compared with 58% (95% CI 44 to 72) given PF (p = 0.15). Of those failing to 
      complete the initial course, 13% on EF and 16% on PF gave up by choice
      (non-adherence), the remainder stopping due to treatment failure. Nasogastric
      administration was more frequent with EF (55%, 95% CI 42 to 68) compared to PF
      (31%, 95% CI 17 to 45) (p = 0.02). Among those treated successfully at first
      presentation, LDT was used for 28% of relapses in the EF group (95% CI 12 to 44) 
      and 39% in the PF group (95% CI 19 to 59) (p>0.2) over the next year. CONCLUSION:
      PF did not effect adherence to LDT but was associated with significantly reduced 
      need for nasogastric tube administration of formula.

TI  - Omega 3 fatty acids (fish oil) for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease.
PG  - CD006320
AB  - BACKGROUND: The anti-inflammatory effects of n-3 (omega-3 fatty acids, fish oil) 
      have been suggested to be beneficial in chronic inflammatory disorders such as
      inflammatory bowel disease. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the efficacy and
      safety of n-3 for maintaining remission in Crohn's disease (CD). SEARCH STRATEGY:
      The following databases were searched from their inception without language
      restriction: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE,
      Healthstar, PubMed, and ACP journal club. Experts were contacted for unpublished 
      data. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCT) of n-3 for
      maintenance of remission in CD were included. Studies must have enrolled patients
      of any age group, who were in remission at the time of recruitment, and were
      followed for at least six months. The intervention must have been fish oil or n-3
      given in pre-defined dosage. Co-interventions were allowed only if they were
      balanced between the study groups. The primary outcome was relapse rate and
      secondary outcomes were change in disease activity scores, time to first relapse 
      and adverse events. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two independent investigators
      reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted the data and assessed study quality
      using Jadad's criteria. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 4.2 software,
      weighted by the Mantel-Haenszel method. Random or fixed effect models were used
      according to degree of heterogeneity and subgroup analyses were performed to
      address heterogeneity. MAIN RESULTS: Four studies were eligible for inclusion.
      There was a non statistically significant benefit of n-3 therapy for maintaining 
      remission (RR 0.64; 95%CI 0.4 to 1.03; P = 0.07). However, the studies were both 
      clinically and statistically heterogeneous (P = 0.01, I(2) = 72%). Three studies 
      used enteric coated capsules (positive effects) and one ordinary gelatin capsules
      (no advantage). Subgroup analyses of studies which used enteric coated capsules
      revealed a statistically significant benefit for maintenance of remission (RR
      0.49; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.69; RD 0.31; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.43); number needed to treat 
      to prevent relapse in 1 year was 3 (95% CI 2 to 5; I(2) = 19%). However, the
      total number of patients enrolled in these studies was small (n = 166). No
      significant adverse events were recorded in any of the studies and not enough
      data were available to analyze the other secondary outcomes. AUTHORS'
      CONCLUSIONS: Omega 3 fatty acids are safe and may be effective for maintenance of
      remission in CD when used in enteric coated capsules. However, there are not
      sufficient data to recommend the routine use of n-3 for maintenance of remission 
      in CD. The small number of patients in the included studies warrants further
      larger RCTs.

TI  - Oral oligofructose-enriched inulin supplementation in acute ulcerative colitis is
      well tolerated and associated with lowered faecal calprotectin.
PG  - 1061-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inulin and oligofructose promote selective growth of saccharolytic
      bacteria with low inflammatory potential. OBJECTIVE: To test the effect of
      oligofructose-enriched inulin in patients with active ulcerative colitis. DESIGN:
      Prospective, randomized, placebo controlled pilot trial. Eligible patients had
      been previously in remission with mesalazine as maintenance therapy or no drug,
      and presented with a relapse of mild to moderate activity. They were treated with
      mesalazine (3 g/day) and randomly allocated to receive either
      oligofructose-enriched inulin (12 g/day, p.o., n = 10) or placebo (12 g/day of
      maltodextrin, p.o., n = 9) for 2 week. Primary endpoint was the anti-inflammatory
      effect as determined by reduction of calprotectin and human DNA in faeces.
      RESULTS: Rachmilewitz score decreased in both groups, reaching statistical
      significance at day 14 (P < 0.05). Oligofructose-enriched inulin was
      well-tolerated and dyspeptic symptoms scale decreased significantly with active
      treatment but not with placebo. At day 7, an early significant reduction of
      calprotectin was observed in the group receiving oligofructose-enriched inulin
      (day 0: 4377 +/- 659 microg/g; day 7: 1033 +/- 393 microg/g, P < 0.05) but not in
      the placebo group (day 0: 5834 +/- 1563 microg/g; day 7: 4084 +/- 1395 microg/g, 
      n.s.). Changes in faecal concentration of human DNA were not significant.
      CONCLUSION: In active ulcerative colitis, dietary supplementation with
      oligofructose-enriched inulin is well tolerated and is associated with early
      reduction in faecal calprotectin.

TI  - Bacteria in Crohn's disease: mechanisms of inflammation and therapeutic
      implications.
PG  - S37-43
AB  - Microbial agents are implicated in each of the most prevalent etiologic
      hypotheses of Crohn's disease. Although chronic infection with a specific,
      persistent pathogen cannot be excluded, it is more likely that Crohn's disease is
      caused by an overly aggressive immune response to normal commensal enteric
      bacteria. The complex, predominantly anaerobic microbiota in the distal ileum and
      colon provide a constant source of antigens and adjuvants that stimulate chronic 
      immune-mediated inflammation in genetically susceptible hosts. Host genetic
      susceptibility in the form of defective mucosal barrier function, bacterial
      killing or processing can lead to enhanced exposure to luminal bacteria and their
      immunologically active components, whereas defective immunoregulation can lead to
      lack of appropriate immunosuppression. Either process can lead to overly
      aggressive T-cell responses to normal bacteria that causes tissue damage.
      Transient infection with pathogenic organisms could serve as environmental
      triggers to initiate inflammatory responses that are perpetuated in susceptible
      hosts by commensal microbial antigens. In addition, commensal bacteria such as
      Escherichia coli recovered from the ileum of patients with recurrent Crohn's
      disease after resection can contain virulence factors that mediate epithelial
      attachment, invasion, and resistance to killing. Finally, Western diet,
      antibiotic use, hygiene, and public health practices may have altered the balance
      of beneficial versus aggressive microbial species. Crohn's disease patients
      exhibit enhanced humoral and T-cell responses to common commensal bacterial and
      fungal antigens. These observations may help identify clinically relevant patient
      subsets and suggest novel therapeutic approaches to restore a beneficial balance 
      of enteric microbiota, enhanced microbial killing, and inhibit aggressive T-cell 
      responses to microbial antigens.

TI  - [Changes in the epidemiology of inflammatory bowel diseases].
PG  - 223-8
AB  - Significant changes have been observed in the epidemiology of inflammatory bowel 
      diseases (IBD) in the last two decades. Traditionally, the incidence of IBD was
      higher in the developed, industrialized countries, in contrast, nowadays it
      became more prevalent in the previously low incidence areas. In particular, the
      incidence of ulcerative colitis (UC) is similar to that observed in North America
      and Western Europe, while the incidence of Crohn's disease (CD) in developing
      countries is still low, suggesting that the environmental factors may act faster 
      or differently in UC than in CD. In Europe, the North to South gradient
      disappeared, and also the West to East gradient is diminishing. Smoking and
      appendectomy may be considered as important environmental factors in both UC and 
      CD, however, with opposite effects. In addition, the use of oral contraceptives
      is associated to disease susceptibility in both diseases. The role of diet,
      perinatal events, stress and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the
      pathogenesis is still controversial.

TI  - Usefulness of an elemental diet in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 15-7
AB  - Crohn's disease is a chronic relapsing disease for which no complete cure is
      available. Although drug therapy with agents such as corticosteroids and
      azathiopurine is useful, the long-term side effects of these drugs are
      problematic. The advent of infliximab has recently brought a change in treatment,
      but the long-term side effects of this agent remain uncertain. In contrast,
      nutritional therapy produces no drug-induced side effects and is effective in
      inducing and maintaining remission. However, sufficient efficacy cannot be
      expected in patients in whom compliance with nutritional regimens gradually
      decreases owing to unpalatability. In these cases, combination therapy with
      agents such as immunosuppressors and infliximab may be useful.

TI  - Acute effects of enteral nutrition on protein turnover in adolescents with Crohn 
      disease.
PG  - 356-60
AB  - Adults with inactive Crohn disease have been shown to have normal rates of
      protein turnover when compared with healthy adults. It is not known whether this 
      is true for adolescents with inactive Crohn disease, when rate of protein
      synthesis must be greater than that of breakdown for normal development. The
      objective of this study was to determine whether enteral nutrition acutely
      suppresses proteolysis and increases protein synthesis in adolescents with
      inactive Crohn disease. Six adolescents (five males/one female; mean age, 15.8
      +/- 1.9 y; range, 13.2-17.6 y; mean bone age, 14.6 +/- 1.8 y; range, 12.5-17 y)
      participated. Leucine (Leu) and phenylalanine (Phe) kinetics were measured using 
      stable isotopes under fasted and fed conditions during a single study visit. In
      response to enteral nutrition, the endogenous rates of appearance (Ra) of Leu and
      Phe (reflecting proteolysis) decreased significantly by 40%. The percentages of
      splanchnic uptake of Leu and Phe were 35 +/- 10% and 13 +/- 12%, respectively.
      Under fed conditions, utilization of Phe for protein synthesis increased
      significantly. We conclude that in clinically stable adolescents with Crohn
      disease, enteral nutrition promotes anabolism by suppressing proteolysis and
      increasing protein synthesis. Rates of suppression of proteolysis were similar to
      those reported previously in normal children.

      children with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 737-44
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) may contribute to the
      alterations in protein and energy metabolism present in children with Crohn's
      disease (CD), who frequently suffer from growth disturbance. We hypothesized that
      anti-TNF-alpha therapy would reduce protein losses, due to decreased proteolysis 
      and increased protein synthesis, and that anti-TNF-alpha therapy would decrease
      resting energy expenditure. METHODS: Children with active CD underwent metabolic 
      assessment immediately before and 2 weeks following initial infliximab infusion. 
      Using the stable isotopes [d5] phenylalanine and [1-13C] leucine, 2 independent
      measures of protein metabolism were determined during fasting and in response to 
      parenteral nutrition. Energy expenditure, determined by indirect calorimetry, was
      measured in fasting and parenterally fed states. RESULTS: Fifteen children
      completed the study. Following infliximab therapy, significant reductions in
      proteolysis (P < 0.05) were noted in the fasting state (8%-11%) and during
      parenteral nutrition infusion (10%-12%). Phenylalanine utilization for protein
      synthesis decreased significantly (8%-13%) following infliximab (P < 0.05).
      Protein balance was not significantly altered. No significant changes in energy
      expenditure were observed following infliximab in fasting or parenterally fed
      states. Supplementation with parenteral nutrition resulted in significantly
      decreased proteolysis (8%-21%; P < 0.05), increased protein synthesis (37%-45%; P
      < 0.01), and improved protein balance (P < 0.01) compared to the fasting state.
      CONCLUSIONS: Following the initial infliximab infusion in children with CD,
      proteolysis and protein synthesis were significantly reduced in the fasting and
      parenterally fed states. Supplementation with parenteral nutrition resulted in
      significant improvements in protein metabolism compared to the fasting state both
      before and after infliximab therapy.

TI  - Impact of long-term enteral nutrition on clinical and endoscopic recurrence after
      resection for Crohn's disease: A prospective, non-randomized, parallel,
      controlled study.
PG  - 67-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: The impact of enteral nutrition on post-operative recurrence has not 
      been properly examined. AIM: To investigate the impact of enteral nutrition using
      an elemental diet on clinical and endoscopic recurrence after resection for
      Crohn's disease. METHODS: Forty consecutive patients who underwent resection for 
      ileal or ileocolonic Crohn's disease were studied. After operation, 20 patients
      continuously received enteral nutritional therapy (EN group), and 20 had neither 
      nutritional therapy nor food restriction (non-EN group). In the EN group, enteral
      formula (Elental) was infused through a nasogastric tube in the night-time, and
      low fat foods were taken in the daytime. All patients were followed up regularly 
      for 1 year after operation. Ileocolonoscopy was performed at 6 and 12 months
      after operation. RESULTS: One patient (5%) in the EN group and seven (35%) in the
      non-EN group developed clinical recurrence during 1-year follow-up (P = 0.048).
      Six months after operation, five patients (25%) in the EN group and eight (40%)
      in the non-EN group developed endoscopic recurrence (P = 0.50). Twelve months
      after operation, endoscopic recurrence was observed in six patients (30%) in the 
      EN group and 14 (70%) in the non-EN group (P = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: Our long-term
      enteral nutritional therapy significantly reduced clinical and endoscopic
      recurrence after resection for Crohn's disease.

TI  - Effect of exclusive enteral nutritional treatment on plasma antioxidant
      concentrations in childhood Crohn's disease.
PG  - 51-6
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Oxidative stress and depletion of antioxidants may play a role
      in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this study was to
      determine the effect of exclusive enteral nutrition, which is increasingly being 
      used as primary therapy for CD, on plasma antioxidant concentrations in children 
      with active CD. METHODS: In a double-blind randomised controlled trial, 15
      children with active CD (mean age, 11.3 years, range 6.8-15.7) attending a
      paediatric gastroenterology referral centre, were assigned to receive either a
      standard polymeric diet (Group S, n=8) or a glutamine-enriched polymeric diet
      (Group G, n=7) as primary therapy for active CD. Plasma concentrations of
      selenium, urates, vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin C, glutathione, and also
      malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured at baseline and after 4 weeks of exclusive
      enteral nutritional treatment. RESULTS: Mean (95% CI) selenium concentration of
      the cohort increased significantly from 0.82 micromol/l (0.72, 0.91) to 1.14
      micromol/l (0.98, 1.3), P<0.001. There were, however, significant reductions in
      mean concentrations of vitamin C {11.8 mg/l (7.7, 15.8) to 6.5 mg/l (4.5, 8.7),
      P=0.01} and vitamin E {11.3 mg/l (10.3, 12.4) to 9.4 mg/l (8.7, 10.1), P=0.03}.
      The concentrations of vitamin A, urates, glutathione and MDA did not change
      significantly over the study period. Glutamine supplementation did not have any
      significant effect on plasma antioxidant concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Significant
      changes in circulating antioxidant concentrations occurred in children with
      active CD receiving exclusive enteral nutritional treatment. Glutamine
      supplementation was not beneficial in improving plasma antioxidant status.

TI  - A possible link between Crohn's disease and ankylosing spondylitis via Klebsiella
      infections.
PG  - 289-97
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) is an immune-mediated gastrointestinal inflammatory disease,
      which could arise from an interplay between genetic and environmental factors.
      Klebsiella microbes were suggested to have a vital role in the initiation and
      perpetuation of the disease through the mechanism of molecular mimicry. This
      proposition is based on the results of various studies where significantly
      elevated levels of antibodies against the whole bacteria or preparations from
      Klebsiella microbes and antibodies to collagen types I, III, IV, and V were
      detected in patients with CD and patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS).
      Molecular similarities were found between Klebsiella nitrogenase and HLA-B27
      genetic markers and between Klebsiella pullulanase and collagen fibers types I,
      III, and IV. Furthermore, significantly positive correlations and
      cross-reactivity binding activities were observed between anti-Klebsiella and
      anticollagen antibodies among patients with CD and AS. Early treatment of CD
      patients with anti-Klebsiella measures is proposed, which may involve the use of 
      antibiotics and low starch diet together with other traditionally used
      immunomodulatory, immunosuppressive, or biologic agents.
