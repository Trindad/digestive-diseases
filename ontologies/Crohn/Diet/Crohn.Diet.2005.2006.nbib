TI  - [Increased IgE-type antibody response to food allergens in irritable bowel
      syndrome and inflammatory bowel diseases].
PG  - 797-802
AB  - BACKGROUND: The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder
      characterized by symptoms of abdominal pain that is associated with disturbed
      defecation. Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC) are collectively
      referred to as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). IBD appears to result from
      dysregulated immune response with contributions from genetic predisposition and
      environmental factors. Among environmental factors the enteric microflora and the
      components of food (eg. antigens) may play important role in the pathogenesis of 
      IBD. The aim of the authors' study was to detect IgE type antibodies against the 
      most frequent food allergens in patients with IBD and IBS. METHODS: Antibodies
      against food allergens (IgE type) with ELISA method in patients with CD, UC and
      IBS were quantitatively measured. The figures were compared to the result of a
      healthy control group contains the same number of participants, and the frequency
      of food allergy in these patient groups were determined. RESULTS: On the basis of
      the study the presence of increased IgE type immune response against any food
      allergens was 34.5% (p = 0.01) in the group of IBS. In patients with CD or UC the
      immune response against food allergens was also more frequent than in the control
      group. The order of frequency of food allergens in IBS was the following: milk
      protein, soybean, tomato, peanut, egg white. CONCLUSION: As the occurrence of
      food allergens was significantly higher in IBS group than in the control group,
      the role of food allergy in the symptoms of IBS can be come up. The frequency of 
      food allergy in patients with diagnosis of IBS, and the similarity of symptoms of
      this two diseases give an obvious opportunity for the patients with IBS to use a 
      diet avoiding the most frequent food allergens, or take e.g. Na-cromoglycate
      which is useful therapy in food allergy.

TI  - A comprehensive approach to evaluate nutritional status in Crohn's patients in
      the era of biologic therapy: a case-control study.
PG  - 2551-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the nutritional status of patients with inactive or mildly
      active Crohn's disease (CD), and identify possible causes for potential
      deficiencies. METHODS: A total of 78 CD patients and 80 healthy controls were
      evaluated in respect of nutritional status, dietary intake, and life styles
      factors. RESULTS: These 73/78 CD patients were on immunomodulating therapies.
      Mean body mass index (BMI) was lower in patients as compared to controls (P=
      0.006) but 32% of CD patients and 33.8% of controls had a BMI > 25, whereas 8%
      and 23.8% in each group, respectively, were obese (BMI > 30Kg/m(2)). Fat free
      mass was significantly decreased in both genders (P < 0.05) whereas fat mass was 
      decreased only in males (P= 0.01). Energy intake was significantly lower in CD
      patients (P < 0.0001) and we observed significantly lower adjusted mean daily
      intakes of carbohydrates, monounsaturated fat, fiber, calcium, and vitamins C, D,
      E, and K (P < 0.05). 29% of patients had excluded grains from their usual diet,
      28% milk, 18% vegetables, and 11% fruits. Milk exclusion resulted in a
      significantly lower consumption of calcium and vitamin K (P < 0.001) and the
      exclusion of vegetables was associated to a lower consumption of vitamins C and E
      (P < 0.05). Physical activity was significantly lower in CD patients (P= 0.01)
      and this lack of physical activity was inversely correlated with increased fat
      mass percentage (r=-0.315, P= 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Results showed that the most
      prevalent form of malnutrition in CD patients was an excess of body weight, which
      was concomitant with an inadequate dietary intake, namely micronutrients, clearly
      related to dietary exclusion of certain foods.

TI  - Lipid metabolism in active Crohn's disease: pre-results.
PG  - 363-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic relapsing disease. Especially acute
      period may be associated with metabolic disturbances. Alteration of lipid
      metabolism has been described in critically ill patients and hypocholesterolemia 
      is associated with poor prognosis. The human organism acquires cholesterol by two
      principal processes - synthesis de novo, and absorption from the diet. It is
      possible to assess, using cholesterol synthesis markers (lathosterol) and
      cholesterol absorption markers (sitosterol, campesterol) the leading form of
      cholesterol acquisition. AIM: The aim of this study is assess the association
      between the lipid profile in plasma and the plasma concentration of sterols in
      active CD patients and in control subjects. METHOD: Routine laboratory tests,
      CDAI, lipid and non-cholesterol sterols plasma levels were performed on days 3,
      14 and 28. The metabolic parameters have been compared with a control cohort of
      100 healthy blood donors. RESULTS: Presently, complete data for 8 patients are
      available The serum total cholesterol, LDL and HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride 
      concentrations were lower in patients with acute Crohn's disease than in the
      control group. Moreover lathosterol, campesterol and sitosterol concentrations
      were lower, whereas squalene concentration was higher than in controls. As
      mentioned above, complete data are not currently available. Therefore statistical
      analysis has not been finished. CONCLUSION: Our pre-results show substantial
      abnormalities in the concentrations of plasma lipids and non-cholesterol sterols,
      which are presented as markers of cholesterol requirement, in patients with acute
      CD.

TI  - Data mining for correlations between diet and Crohn's disease activity.
PG  - 897
AB  - Crohn's disease is a debilitating condition that affects the entire
      gastrointestinal tract and often requires aggressive and invasive therapies.
      Several studies have suggested dietary triggers for disease activity. We have
      created a web-based tool to allow participants to record both daily food intake
      and wellness (i.e., disease-specific quality of life). We seek to determine if
      measurable correlations exist between these events in patients with Crohn's
      disease. Advanced data mining techniques are employed to find such correlations
      and the efficacies of chosen techniques are assessed. We tested our web-based
      system in a pilot study involving 7 participants, and we found that traditional
      statistical techniques identified diet and disease activity correlations in
      short-term data sets.

TI  - [Dietary characteristics of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases].
PG  - 895-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate nutritional status and dietary habits of Lithuanian
      patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and to compare with those of
      healthy controls. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case-control study was conducted in
      the Department of Gastroenterology, Kaunas University of Medicine Hospital. A
      total of 101 patients with ulcerative colitis, 44 with Crohn's disease, and 178
      healthy controls were examined with the help of standard self-report
      questionnaire about daily dietary habits. Healthy controls were evaluated in
      primary care centers during preventive examinations. Body mass index was
      calculated for all patients in a standard way. RESULTS: There was no
      statistically significant difference between patients and controls concerning
      consumption of coffee, tea, chewing gum, type of fat for meal preparation, white 
      bread, cooked potatoes and sausages, non-carbonated water. Patients with
      inflammatory bowel diseases statistically significantly less frequently consumed 
      fresh milk, cheese, fish, fried potatoes, and soda drinks. Patients with Crohn's 
      disease statistically significantly less frequently consumed fresh fruits and
      patients with ulcerative colitis--fresh vegetables as compared to controls. Body 
      mass index of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases was significantly lower
      compared to controls, and patients with Crohn's disease had significantly lower
      body mass index than ulcerative colitis patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with
      inflammatory bowel diseases have lower body mass index than healthy controls.
      Patients consume fresh milk, cheese, canned and fresh vegetables and fruits less 
      frequently; therefore, primary care physicians and patients should be provided
      with teaching and more information about nutrition issues.

TI  - Effect of exclusive enteral nutritional treatment on plasma antioxidant
      concentrations in childhood Crohn's disease.
PG  - 51-6
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Oxidative stress and depletion of antioxidants may play a role
      in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this study was to
      determine the effect of exclusive enteral nutrition, which is increasingly being 
      used as primary therapy for CD, on plasma antioxidant concentrations in children 
      with active CD. METHODS: In a double-blind randomised controlled trial, 15
      children with active CD (mean age, 11.3 years, range 6.8-15.7) attending a
      paediatric gastroenterology referral centre, were assigned to receive either a
      standard polymeric diet (Group S, n=8) or a glutamine-enriched polymeric diet
      (Group G, n=7) as primary therapy for active CD. Plasma concentrations of
      selenium, urates, vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin C, glutathione, and also
      malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured at baseline and after 4 weeks of exclusive
      enteral nutritional treatment. RESULTS: Mean (95% CI) selenium concentration of
      the cohort increased significantly from 0.82 micromol/l (0.72, 0.91) to 1.14
      micromol/l (0.98, 1.3), P<0.001. There were, however, significant reductions in
      mean concentrations of vitamin C {11.8 mg/l (7.7, 15.8) to 6.5 mg/l (4.5, 8.7),
      P=0.01} and vitamin E {11.3 mg/l (10.3, 12.4) to 9.4 mg/l (8.7, 10.1), P=0.03}.
      The concentrations of vitamin A, urates, glutathione and MDA did not change
      significantly over the study period. Glutamine supplementation did not have any
      significant effect on plasma antioxidant concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Significant
      changes in circulating antioxidant concentrations occurred in children with
      active CD receiving exclusive enteral nutritional treatment. Glutamine
      supplementation was not beneficial in improving plasma antioxidant status.

TI  - Factors affecting recurrence in patients with Crohn's disease under nutritional
      therapy.
PG  - S68-74
AB  - PURPOSE: This retrospective study was designed to determine risk factors for
      recurrence of Crohn's disease under enteral nutrition. METHODS: The clinical
      course of 145 patients with Crohn's disease, who were primarily induced into
      remission by total parenteral nutrition, was reviewed. The patients were
      classified into two groups: enteral nutrition group (n = 98; >/=1,200 kcal/day of
      enteral nutrition), or nonenteral nutrition group (n = 47;<1,200 kcal/day of
      enteral nutrition) according to the amount of their daily elemental or polymeric 
      diet. Contributions of enteral nutrition and other clinical variables to the
      recurrence were analyzed retrospectively. A Crohn's disease activity index of
      >150 plus an increase in Crohn's disease activity index of >70 from the baseline 
      value was defined as recurrence. RESULTS: Forty-two patients in the enteral
      nutrition group and 29 patients in the nonenteral nutrition group recurred during
      periods ranging from 3 to 159 months. The cumulative rate of recurrence was
      significantly higher in the nonenteral nutrition group than in the enteral
      nutrition group (P = 0.047). Among the Crohn's disease patients in the enteral
      nutrition group, penetrating type (relative risk, 3.89; 95 percent confidence
      interval, 1.58-9.62), colonic involvement (relative risk, 3.10; 95 percent
      confidence interval, 1.39-6.9), and previous history of surgery (relative risk,
      2.48; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.16-5.33) were factors that significantly 
      affected recurrence. In contrast, penetrating type was the only possible factor
      associated with recurrence in the nonenteral nutrition group (relative risk,
      2.75; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.96-7.81). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients
      with Crohn's disease under maintenance enteral nutrition, the risk of recurrence 
      differs according to the disease type and the site of involvement. The
      maintenance treatment by enteral nutrition alone seems insufficient for patients 
      with penetrating type or with colonic involvement.

TI  - Low intestinal glutamine level and low glutaminase activity in Crohn's disease: a
      rational for glutamine supplementation?
PG  - 2170-9
AB  - Intestinal glutamine utilization is integral to mucosal regeneration. We analyzed
      the systemic and intestinal glutamine status in Crohn's disease (CD) and
      evaluated the therapeutic effect of glutamine supplementation in an animal model 
      of ileitis. In CD, glutamine concentrations were decreased systemically and in
      noninflamed and inflamed ileal/colonic mucosa. Mucosal glutaminase activities
      were depressed in the ileum independent of inflammation but were not different
      from controls in the colon. In experimental ileitis, oral glutamine feeding
      prevented macroscopic inflammation, enhanced ileal and colonic glutaminase
      activities above controls, and normalized the intestinal glutathione redox
      status. However, glutamine supplementation enhanced myeloperoxidase activity
      along the gastrointestinal tract and potentiated lipid peroxidation in the colon.
      In conclusion, glutamine metabolism is impaired in CD. In experimental ileitis,
      glutamine supplementation prevents inflammatory tissue damage. In the colon,
      however, which does not use glutamine as its principal energy source, immune
      enhancement of inflammatory cells by glutamine increases oxidative tissue injury.

TI  - Effectiveness of an 'half elemental diet' as maintenance therapy for Crohn's
      disease: A randomized-controlled trial.
PG  - 1333-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although thiopurines have a proven role in maintenance therapy for
      Crohn's disease, an alternative therapy is needed for patients intolerant or
      resistant to thiopurines. AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of home enteral
      nutrition as a maintenance therapy regimen in which half of the daily calorie
      requirement is provided by an elemental diet and the remaining half by a free
      diet. We refer to this home enteral nutrition therapy as 'half elemental diet'.
      METHODS: Between 2002 and 2005, 51 patients in remission from two hospitals were 
      randomly assigned to a half elemental diet group (n = 26) or a free diet group (n
      = 25). The primary outcome measure of this study was the occurrence of relapse
      over the 2-year period. RESULTS: The relapse rate in the half elemental diet
      group was significantly lower [34.6% vs. 64.0%; multivariate hazard ratio 0.40
      (95% CI: 0.16-0.98)] than that in the free diet group after a mean follow-up of
      11.9 months. Compliance was similar in the two groups. No adverse event occurred 
      in any of the patients throughout the study. CONCLUSION: This
      randomized-controlled trial shows the effectiveness of an half elemental diet,
      which is a promising maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease patients.

TI  - Environmental factors in inflammatory bowel disease: a co-twin control study of a
      Swedish-Danish twin population.
PG  - 925-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genetics and environmental factors are implicated in the etiology of 
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We studied environmental factors in a
      population-based Swedish-Danish twin cohort using the co-twin control method.
      SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to 317 twin pairs regarding
      markers of exposures in the following areas: infections/colonization and diet as 
      well as smoking, appendectomy, and oral contraceptives. Odds ratios (OR) were
      calculated by conditional logistic regression. When confounding appeared
      plausible, multivariate conditional logistic regression was added. The questions 
      were also divided into topic groups, and adjustment was made for multiple testing
      within each of the groups. RESULTS: The response rate to the questionnaire was
      83%. In consideration of the study design, only discordant pairs were included
      (Crohn's disease [CD], n = 102; ulcerative colitis [UC], n = 125). Recurrent
      gastrointestinal infections were associated with both UC (OR, 8.0; 95% confidence
      interval [CI], 1.0-64) and CD (OR, 5.5; 95% CI, 1.2-25). Hospitalization for
      gastrointestinal infections was associated with CD (OR, 12; 95% CI, 1.6-92).
      Smoking was inversely associated with UC (OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.9) and
      associated with CD (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.2-7.1). CONCLUSIONS: The observed
      associations indicate that markers of possible infectious events may influence
      the risk of IBD. Some of these effects might be mediated by long-term changes in 
      gut flora or alterations in reactivity to the flora. The influence of smoking in 
      IBD was confirmed.

TI  - Sources and severity of self-reported food intolerance after ileal pouch-anal
      anastomosis.
PG  - 1459-62
AB  - Data on food intolerance after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis are scarce. The aim
      of this study was to identify foods causing intolerance and to determine the
      nature and severity of reported symptoms. Patients from the Dutch Crohn's and
      Ulcerative Colitis Association were mailed a survey on food intolerance; 105 (31%
      men) of 137 patients took part. They all reported intolerance to one or more
      foods. Common symptoms (scored from 0=absent to 10=severe), included diarrhea
      (mean score=5.8), fatigue (mean score=5.5), and thirst (mean score=4.6). Spicy
      foods, cabbage, and citrus fruits (or juice) were most likely to decrease stool
      consistency, increase stool frequency, or cause perianal irritation. Onions,
      cabbage, or leeks were reported by 28% of the patients to cause flatulence. The
      urge to defecate was stronger after a cooked meal (45% within (1/2) hour) than
      after sandwiches (15% within (1/2) hour). Foods reported to increase stool
      consistency were potato products, bread, and bananas. This study demonstrates
      that food intolerance is a common, albeit mild, problem after ileal pouch-anal
      anastomosis. Food and nutrition professionals should encourage patients to base
      their food choices on individual tolerance as long as no (patho-)
      physiological-based evidence to the contrary is available.

TI  - The use of electrogastrography and external ultrasonography to evaluate gastric
      motility in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 277-84
AB  - Although Crohn's disease is associated with various digestive symptoms, there
      have been few reports on gastric motility. In this study, we conducted a study of
      gastric motility in Crohn's disease using 20 healthy subjects (N group) and 15
      patients with Crohn's disease (C group) by electrogastrography (EGG) using a
      Nipro electrogastrograph. An EGG was recorded for 30 minutes in a fasting state
      and after ingestion of 300 ml of a liquid meal. As an index of gastric emptying, 
      the rate of change in the cross-sectional area of the gastric antrum was measured
      1 and 15 minutes after ingestion of the liquid meal by external ultrasonography. 
      In an EGG frequency analysis, waveforms with a peak of 3 cycles/minute (cpm) were
      noted in the N group, and the peak amplitude increased significantly after the
      ingestion of food. In the C group, division of the normal-gastria component was
      noted after the ingestion of food in 5 patients (33.3%). In a comparison of the
      peak amplitudes of fasting brady-gastria, normal-gastria, and tachy-gastria
      between the N and C groups, the peak amplitude was significantly increased in
      normal-gastria in the N group, and in brady-gastria and tachy-gastria in the C
      group. In a comparison of the rates of food ingestion-induced changes in the peak
      amplitudes for brady-gastria, normal-gastria, and tachy-gastria between the N and
      C groups, the peak amplitudes were significantly increased in normal-gastria in
      the N group, but not in the C group. In the case of gastric emptying investigated
      by external ultrasonography, the rate of food ingestion-induced change in the
      cross-sectional antrum area was significantly lower in the C group (50.5+/-9.2%) 
      than in the N group (65.0+/-8.5%). For gastrointestinal motility, a 3 cpm
      normal-gastria represents efficient gastric motility. In the C group, the peak
      amplitudes of brady-gastria and tachy-gastria were significantly increased, but
      were low in normal-gastria in the fasting EGG, postprandial division of the
      normal-gastria component was noted, and the rate of food ingestion-induced
      increase in the normal-gastria peak amplitude was significantly lower than that
      in the N group, suggesting that patients with Crohn's disease have a functional
      abnormality in, not only the small and large intestine, but also the stomach.

TI  - A possible link between Crohn's disease and ankylosing spondylitis via Klebsiella
      infections.
PG  - 289-97
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) is an immune-mediated gastrointestinal inflammatory disease,
      which could arise from an interplay between genetic and environmental factors.
      Klebsiella microbes were suggested to have a vital role in the initiation and
      perpetuation of the disease through the mechanism of molecular mimicry. This
      proposition is based on the results of various studies where significantly
      elevated levels of antibodies against the whole bacteria or preparations from
      Klebsiella microbes and antibodies to collagen types I, III, IV, and V were
      detected in patients with CD and patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS).
      Molecular similarities were found between Klebsiella nitrogenase and HLA-B27
      genetic markers and between Klebsiella pullulanase and collagen fibers types I,
      III, and IV. Furthermore, significantly positive correlations and
      cross-reactivity binding activities were observed between anti-Klebsiella and
      anticollagen antibodies among patients with CD and AS. Early treatment of CD
      patients with anti-Klebsiella measures is proposed, which may involve the use of 
      antibiotics and low starch diet together with other traditionally used
      immunomodulatory, immunosuppressive, or biologic agents.

TI  - Malabsorption is a major contributor to underweight in Crohn's disease patients
      in remission.
PG  - 855-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Undernutrition has been reported in 65-75% of patients with Crohn's
      disease. The present study aimed at identifying the relative contribution of
      malnutrition-causing factors in patients with Crohn's disease in remission.
      METHODS: Sixteen patients with Crohn's disease (age 19-57 y) in remission
      (Crohn's Activity Disease Index < 150) were included in the study. Their weight
      was stable for >3 mo and they were off steroids. They all completed 3-d food
      records and concomitantly collected stools. Self-reported food records were
      analyzed and energy content in stools was determined by a direct bomb
      calorimeter. Resting energy expenditure (REE) was studied by indirect calorimetry
      and body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The study cohort was
      divided into two groups, with a body mass index (BMI) equal to 18.5 kg/m(2)
      serving as a cutoff point. RESULTS: Subjects with lower BMIs tended to have less 
      lean body mass (P = 0.006), less bone mineral density (P = 0.006), and lower REE 
      (P = 0.003). No correlation was found between BMI and energy intake but the
      percentage of malabsorption was negatively correlated with BMI (P = 0.07). When
      dividing the study based on a BMI of 18.5 kg/m(2), no difference was found in
      caloric intake or REE between groups but subjects with lower BMIs had significant
      prominent malabsorption compared with the others (21.1 +/- 9.8% versus 11.7 +/-
      3.5%, P = 0.015). CONCLUSION: In the presence of similar energy intake, REE does 
      not seem to contribute to lower BMI, although nutrient malabsorption is higher in
      malnourished patients with Crohn's disease in remission. We suggest that
      malabsorption be evaluated in patients with Crohn's disease who fail to gain
      weight during disease remission to establish their extra caloric requirements.

TI  - A case of Crohn's disease with hydronephrosis caused by ureteropelvic junction
      obstruction.
PG  - 1015-8
AB  - Ureteral obstruction is a rare extraintestinal manifestation of Crohn's disease
      (CD). We report the case of a 20-year-old man who presented with fever,
      diarrhoea, and lower abdominal pain. Diagnostic studies confirmed CD and revealed
      an abdominal mass obstructing the right ureter and hydronephrosis. Ureteropelvic 
      junction (UPJ) obstruction was diagnosed. Despite an elemental diet and
      mesalazine therapy, the hydronephrosis persisted, and the patient eventually
      required surgery. Successful laparoscopic pyeloplasty was performed. This is the 
      first report of CD associated with UPJ obstruction. Ureteral obstruction as a
      complication of CD is discussed.

TI  - [Environmental risk factors in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (excluding 
      tobacco and appendicectomy)].
PG  - 859-67
AB  - A rapid increase in the incidence of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in
      developed countries, the occurrence of Crohn's disease in spouses, and a lack of 
      complete concordance in monozygotic twins are strong arguments for the role of
      environmental factors in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Research in the field 
      of environmental factors in IBD is based upon epidemiological (geographical and
      case-control), clinical and experimental studies. The role of two environmental
      factors has clearly been established in IBD. Smoking is a risk factor for Crohn's
      disease and a protective factor for ulcerative colitis; appendectomy is a
      protective factor for ulcerative colitis. Many other environmental factors for
      IBD have been investigated, including infectious agents, diet, drugs, stress and 
      social status. They are detailed in the present review. Among them, atypical
      Mycobacteria, oral contraceptives and antibiotics could play a role in Crohn's
      disease. To date, three hypotheses associate environmental factors with the
      pathophysiology of IBD (loss of tolerance of intestinal immune system towards
      commensal bacterial flora): the hygiene, infection and cold chain hypotheses.
      Much work remains to be done to identify risk factors for IBD. Research
      identifying environmental factors that might cause a predisposition to IBD is
      useful. It may lead to disease prevention in subjects who are genetically
      predisposed and disease improvement in patients.

TI  - [Pyoderma gangrenosum, a nonintestinal manifestation of Lesniowski-Crohn's
      disease in a 15 years old girl].
PG  - 463-73
AB  - In the clinical course of Lesniowski-Crohn's disease in children,
      gastrointestinal symptoms are predominant. Extraintestinal manifestations are
      found rarely, contrary to adults. Pyoderma gangrenosum is hardly ever observed
      but frequently coexists with colon involvement. The aim of the study was a
      presentation of 15 years old girl with Lesniowski-Crohn's disease and predominant
      joint and skin symptoms in form of pyoderma gangrenosum. Skin lesions were shaped
      in solitary ulcerations with cyanotic undermined border localized on legs and
      buttocks. After steroid therapy these changes were healed with permanent blue
      scar. Gastrointestinal symptoms though slight were characteristic. The girl had
      stools with some fresh blood and perianal lesions.

TI  - Effect of concurrent elemental diet on infliximab treatment for Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1143-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infliximab and elemental diet (ED) have been shown to be effective in
      the management of Crohn's disease. However, few experiences have been reported
      regarding their combination therapy. The aim of the present study was to
      investigate the efficacy and safety of infliximab in Japanese patients, the first
      such study in Asia, as well as the effect of concomitant ED. METHODS: One hundred
      and ten consecutive patients receiving infliximab were followed up to week 16
      after the last infusion, and clinical response and primary outcome were
      collected. A response was defined as a reduction in Harvey-Bradshaw Index for
      inflammatory disease and closure of fistula in fistulizing disease. RESULTS: Out 
      of 75 inflammatory and 35 fistulizing disease patients, 68 (90.7%) and 25 (71.4%)
      responded at week 4, and 38 (50.7%) and 14 (40.0%) continued to respond until
      week 16, respectively. Interestingly, inflammatory disease patients with
      concurrent ED had a significantly higher response rate at week 16 (68.4%) than
      those without ED (32.4%, P = 0.0026). The effects of ED were independent of the
      usage of azathioprine and smoking habit. CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab was clinically
      useful in the treatment of Crohn's disease in Japanese patients as well as in
      those in Western countries. The efficacy of concurrent ED was suggestive and
      should be confirmed in a randomized controlled study.

TI  - A population-based case control study of potential risk factors for IBD.
PG  - 993-1002
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to pursue potential etiological clues to Crohn's disease
      (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) through a population-based case control survey
      study. METHODS: Cases with CD (n = 364) and UC (n = 217), ages 18-50 yr were
      drawn from the population-based University of Manitoba IBD Research Registry.
      Potential control subjects were drawn from the population-based Manitoba Health
      Registry by age, gender, and geographic residence matching to the cases (n =
      433). Subjects were administered a multiitem questionnaire. RESULTS: By
      univariate analysis, some of the variables predictive of CD included lower
      likelihood of living on a farm, of having drunk unpasteurized milk or having
      eaten pork, and UC patients were less likely to have drunk unpasteurized milk and
      to have eaten pork. On multivariate analysis, variables significantly associated 
      with CD were being Jewish (OR = 4.32, 95% CI 1.10-16.9), having a first degree
      relative with IBD (OR = 3.07, 95% CI 1.73-5.46), ever having smoked (OR = 1.54,
      95% CI, 1.06-2.25), living longer with a smoker (OR = 1.03, 95% CI, 1.01-1.04).
      Being a first generation Canadian (OR = 0.33, 95% CI, 0.17-0.62), having pet cats
      before age 5 (OR = 0.66, 95% CI, 0.46-0.96) and having larger families (OR =
      0.87, 95% CI, 0.79-0.96) were protective against CD. For UC being Jewish (OR =
      7.46, 95% CI, 2.33-23.89), having a relative with IBD (OR = 2.23, 95% CI,
      1.27-3.9), and ever smoking (OR = 1.62, 95% CI, 1.14-2.32) were predictive.
      CONCLUSION: This study reinforced the increased risk associated with family
      history, being Jewish, and smoking history, however, a number of significant
      associations with CD and UC on univariate and multivariate analysis may support
      the "hygiene hypothesis" and warrant further exploration in prospective studies.

TI  - Polymeric diet alone versus corticosteroids in the treatment of active pediatric 
      Crohn's disease: a randomized controlled open-label trial.
PG  - 744-53
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nutritional therapy has been reported to have an almost
      equivalent efficacy of corticosteroids in achieving clinical remission in active 
      Crohn's disease (CD). However, the effects of both treatments on intestinal
      mucosal inflammation rarely are reported. In a randomized controlled trial in
      children with active CD we compared the efficacy of nutritional therapy alone or 
      corticosteroids on clinical variables and intestinal mucosal healing. METHODS: In
      a prospective, 10-week open-label trial, children with active, naive CD were
      randomized to orally polymeric formula alone or oral corticosteroids. The
      clinical activity index and nutritional and activity serum variables were
      evaluated at week 0 and then every 2 weeks; intestinal mucosal inflammation was
      assessed through endoscopy and histology at weeks 0 and 10. Primary efficacy
      outcomes were clinical remission and mucosal healing. RESULTS: Of the 37 children
      randomized, 19 received polymeric formula and 18 received corticosteroids. At
      week 10, on an intention-to-treat basis, the proportion of patients achieving
      clinical remission was comparable between the 2 groups (polymeric formula: 15/19 
      [79%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 56%-92%]; corticosteroid group: 12/18 [67%;
      95% CI, 44%-84%]; P = .4; not significant). On the contrary, the proportion of
      children showing mucosa healing was significantly higher in the polymeric (14/19;
      74%; 95% CI, 51%-89%) than the corticosteroid group (6/18 [33%; 95% CI, 16%-57%];
      P < .05). At week 10 both endoscopic and histologic scores significantly
      decreased only in the polymeric group (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: In children with
      active and recently diagnosed CD, a short course of polymeric diet is more
      effective than corticosteroids in inducing healing of gut inflammatory lesions.

TI  - Amelioration of anemia after kidney transplantation in severe secondary oxalosis.
PG  - 216-21
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In small bowel disease such as M. Crohn, the intestinal absorption 
      of oxalate is increased. Severe calcium oxalate deposition in multiple organs as 
      consequence of enteric hyperoxaluria may lead to severe organ dysfunction and
      chronic renal failure. The management of hemodialyzed patients with short bowel
      syndrome may be associated with vascular access problems and oxalate infiltration
      of the bone marrow leading to pancytopenia. Although the risk of recurrence of
      the disease is very high after renal transplantation, it may be the ultimate
      therapeutic alternative in secondary hyperoxaluria. CASE: Here, we report a
      patient with enteric oxalosis due to Crohn's disease. He developed end-stage
      renal disease, erythropoietin-resistant anemia, oxalate infiltration of the bone 
      marrow and severe vascular access problems. Following high-urgency kidney
      transplantation, daily hemodiafiltration of 3 hours was performed for 2 weeks to 
      increase oxalate clearance. Despite tubular and interstitial deposition of
      oxalate in the renal transplant, the patient did not require further hemodialysis
      and the hematocrit levels normalized. DISCUSSION: Early treatment of
      hyperoxaluria due to short bowel syndrome is essential to prevent renal
      impairment. Declining renal function leads to a further increase in oxalate
      accumulation and consecutive oxalate deposition in the bone marrow or in the
      vascular wall. If alternative treatments such as special diet or daily
      hemodialysis are insufficient, kidney transplantation may be a therapeutic
      alternative in severe cases of enteric oxalosis despite a possible recurrence of 
      the disease.

TI  - Evaluation of short-term responsiveness and cutoff values of inflammatory bowel
      disease questionnaire in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 199-204
AB  - BACKGROUND: The inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ) is a frequently
      used outcome parameter in clinical trials. Whereas the validity and
      reproducibility of the IBDQ have been extensively studied, there are limited data
      on its short-term responsiveness and cutoff values for remission and partial
      clinical response. METHODS: The IBDQ score and its bowel (BD), systemic (SysD),
      emotional (ED), and social (SocD) dimensions were tested for responsiveness in a 
      cohort of 224 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) treated with infliximab for
      refractory luminal disease. Changes in the IBDQ score and its dimensions 4 weeks 
      after therapy were analyzed and correlated with changes in the Crohn's Disease
      Activity Index (CDAI). The responsiveness ratios of the IBDQ and its dimensions
      were analyzed. Using regression line with DeltaCDAI, the cutoff values for the
      IBDQ remission and response were calculated. RESULTS: Overall, there was a good
      correlation between the CDAI and IBDQ at week 0 (correlation coefficient, 0.69; P
      < .001) and week 4 (-0.76; P < .001) and change after 4 weeks (0.74; P < .001).
      The correlation coefficients for DeltaCDAI and changes in BD, SysD, ED, and SocD 
      were 0.753, 0.552, 0.620, and 0.631, respectively; all P < 0.001. The
      responsiveness ratios for DeltaIBDQ, BD, SysD, ED, and SocD were 2.6, 2.1, 1.9,
      1.7, and 1.9, respectively. Regression line for the IBDQ (r = -0.76, P < .001)
      resulted in a cutoff value for remission of 168 points and for DeltaIBDQ resulted
      in a cutoff value of 22 and 27 points for clinical improvement based on DeltaCDAI
      > or = -70 and > or = -100 points. CONCLUSIONS: The IBDQ is a responsive
      instrument for reflecting quick change in the quality of life of patients with
      CD. Cutoff values for the IBDQ remission and partial response were 168 and > or =
      27 points.

TI  - Nutritional deficiencies in patients with Crohn's disease in remission.
PG  - 185-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) are at risk of developing
      nutritional deficiencies, especially because of restrictive diets. The aim of our
      study was to assess food intake and the status for vitamins and trace elements in
      nonselected CD patients in clinical remission. METHODS: A total of 54 consecutive
      CD patients (28 females, 26 males, 39 +/- 2 years of age [mean +/- SD]) in
      clinical remission for >3 months underwent body composition, resting energy
      expenditure, nutrient intake, and plasma concentration assessment, and were
      compared with 25 healthy controls (16 females, 9 males, 38 +/- 3 years old).
      RESULTS: According to the nutritional risk index, 37 patients (70%) were not
      malnourished, 12 were at moderate risk, and 4 were at severe risk for
      malnutrition. Fat mass was lower in patients in remission compared with controls 
      (P = 0.04). The mean daily energy intake was comparable between patients (2218
      +/- 92 kcal/day) and controls (2066 +/- 101 kcal/day), covering their needs. No
      significant difference was observed for macronutrient intake in comparison with
      controls; compared to controls, female CD patients had lower intakes of
      beta-carotene (P < 0.005), vitamins B1 (P < 0.05), B6 (P < 0.01), and C (P <
      0.005), and magnesium (P < 0.01). They had significantly higher intakes of zinc
      (P < 0.01). Male CD patients had lower intakes of beta-carotene and vitamin C (P 
      < 0.05). More than 50% of patients had low plasma concentrations of vitamin C
      (84%), copper (84%), niacin (77%), and zinc (65%). CONCLUSIONS: In CD patients in
      remission, macronutrient needs are usually covered by food intake. However,
      micronutrient deficiencies are frequent and call for specific screening and
      treatment.

TI  - Acute duodenal Crohn's disease successfully managed with low-speed elemental diet
      infusion via nasogastric tube: a case report.
PG  - 649-51
AB  - Duodenal Crohn's disease is rare, and patients without obstruction are treated
      medically. We herein report one case whose duodenal Crohn's disease was
      successfully managed with low-speed elemental diet infusion through a nasogastric
      tube. A 28-year-old female developed acute duodenal Crohn's disease. Upper GI
      radiologic and endoscopic examinations showed a stricture in the duodenal bulb.
      Using the duodenal biopsy specimens, mucosal cytokine levels were measured;
      interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels were
      remarkably elevated. For initial 2 wk, powdered mesalazine was orally given but
      it was not effective. For the next 2 wk, she was treated with low-speed elemental
      diet therapy using a commercially available Elental(TM), which was infused
      continuously through a nasogastric tube using an infusion pump. The tip of the
      nasogastric tube was placed at an immediate oral side of the pylorus. The
      infusion speed was 10 mL/h (usual speed, 100 mL/h). After the 2-wk treatment, her
      symptoms were very much improved, and endoscopically, the duodenal stricture and 
      inflammation improved. The duodenal mucosal cytokine levels remarkably decreased 
      compared with those before the treatment. Although our experience was limited,
      low-speed elemental diet infusion through a nasogastric tube may be a useful
      treatment for acute duodenal Crohn's disease.

TI  - Effect of fish oil enriched enteral diet on inflammatory bowel disease tissues in
      organ culture: differential effects on ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.
PG  - 7466-72
AB  - AIM: To investigate the influence of fish oil enriched enteral diet on intestinal
      tissues taken from Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and non-inflamed
      non-IBD control patients in vitro. METHODS: Colonoscopic biopsies from patients
      with active CD (n = 4), active UC (n = 7), and non-inflamed non-IBD control
      patients (n = 4) were incubated (three dilutions of 1:20, 1:10, and 1:5) with
      Waymouth's culture medium and enteral elemental diet (EO28, SHS, Liverpool, UK)
      modified in the fatty acid composition with fish oil (EF) in an organ culture
      system for 24 h. In each experimental set-up, incubation with Waymouth's medium
      alone as control was included. Tissue viability was assessed by adding
      bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) to the culture fluid and immunohistochemically staining 
      for BrdU uptake. Cytokine ratio of IL-1ra/IL-1beta (low ratio indicative of
      inflammation) and production of those cytokines as a percentage of medium control
      were assayed in the culture supernatant. RESULTS: Incubation of CD-affected
      tissue with EF (1:20, 1:10, and 1:5) modestly and non-significantly increased
      IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio as compared with medium control (CD 39.1+/-16.1;
      26.5+/-7.8, 47.1+/-16.8 vs control 13.0+/-2.2), but incubation of UC-affected
      tissues increased IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio significantly in all three dilutions (UC 
      69.1+/-32.2, P<0.05; 76.1+/-36.4, P = 0.05; 84.5+/-37.3, P<0.02; vs control
      10.2+/-3.7). Incubation of non-inflamed non-IBD control tissue did not increase
      the IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio in any dilution compared to medium control
      (69.3+/-47.0, 54.1+/-30.6, 79.4+/-34.0 vs control 76.1+/-37.3). Average
      percentage production of IL-1beta indexed against medium control was
      significantly less in UC after EF incubation as compared with CD (UC 24.0+/-4.8
      vs CD 51.8+/-8.1; P<0.05). Average percentage production of IL-1ra was markedly
      higher in UC (135.9+/-3.4) than that in control patients (36.5+/-4.3) (P<0.0001).
      CONCLUSION: IBD tissues, after incubation with elemental diet modified in its
      fatty acid composition with fish oil, show an increase in IL-1ra/IL-1beta
      cytokine ratio. This effect of omega-3 fatty acid modulation is significantly
      more marked in UC compared with CD and is accompanied by both a reduction of

      elemental diet with fish oil in tissue affected with UC suggests dietary
      treatment of UC may be possible.

TI  - Usefulness of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in addition to mesalazine in
      maintaining remission in pediatric Crohn's disease: a double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 7118-21
AB  - AIM: To assess the value of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (FAs) supplementation 
      in addition to amino-salicylic-acid (5-ASA) in pediatric patients with Crohn's
      disease (CD). METHODS: Thirty-eight patients (20 males and 18 females, mean age
      10.13 years, range 5-16 years) with CD in remission were randomized into two
      groups and treated for 12 mo. Group I (18 patients) received 5-ASA (50 mg/kg/d)+ 
      omega-3 FAs as triglycerides in gastro-resistant capsules, 3 g/d (eicosapentanoic
      acid, EPA, 400 mg/g, docosahexaenoic acid, DHA, 200 mg/g). Group II (20 patients)
      received 5-ASA (50 mg/kg/d)+olive oil placebo capsules. Patients were evaluated
      for fatty acid incorporation in red blood cell membranes by gas chromatography at
      baseline 6 and 12 mo after the treatment. RESULTS: The number of patients who
      relapsed at 1 year was significantly lower in group I than in group II (P<0.001).
      Patients in group I had a significant increase in the incorporation of EPA and
      DHA (P<0.001) and a decrease in the presence of arachidonic acids. CONCLUSION:
      Enteric-coated omega-3 FAs in addition to treatment with 5-ASA are effective in
      maintaining remission of pediatric CD.

TI  - High-output stoma after small-bowel resections for Crohn's disease.
PG  - 604-8; quiz 609
AB  - BACKGROUND: A 56-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of Crohn's disease and
      multiple bowel resections resulting in a loop jejunostomy was referred to our
      Nutritional Unit from a neighboring district general hospital for further
      management. She was first seen in October 2001, and initial assessment indicated 
      that she was malnourished with fluid depletion, evidenced by the high volume of
      stomal fluid produced. There had been no sudden change in her medication, her
      Crohn's disease was quiescent and there was no evidence of any intra-abdominal
      sepsis. Despite a high calorific intake through her diet, she continued to lose
      weight. INVESTIGATIONS: Serum urea and electrolytes; magnesium; C-reactive
      protein; full blood count; urinary spot sodium; anthropometric measurements.
      DIAGNOSIS: High-output stoma with malabsorption as a consequence of repeated
      small-bowel surgery. MANAGEMENT: The patient was treated with oral hypotonic
      fluid restriction (0.5 l/day), 2 l of oral glucose-saline solution per day,
      high-dose oral antimotility agents (loperamide and codeine phosphate), a
      proton-pump inhibitor (omeprazole) and oral magnesium replacement. A year later, 
      the patient's loop jejunostomy was closed and an end ileostomy fashioned,
      bringing an additional 35 cm of small bowel into continuity; macronutrient
      absorption improved but her problem of dehydration was only slightly reduced. She
      was stabilized on a twice-weekly subcutaneous magnesium and saline infusion and
      daily oral 1alpha-hydroxycholecalciferol.

TI  - Therapeutic efficacy of infliximab on active Crohn's disease under nutritional
      therapy.
PG  - 1423-30
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this investigation was to elucidate retrospectively the
      therapeutic effect of infliximab in patients with active Crohn's disease (CD)
      under nutritional therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using a review of the clinical
      records in 24 nationwide institutions specializing in inflammatory bowel disease,
      the short-term effect of infliximab in 97 patients with active CD was
      retrospectively investigated. The Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) at
      baseline and after 2 weeks of a single infliximab administration (5 mg/kg) was
      compared among patients under total parenteral nutrition (TPN group, n=36), those
      following an elemental or polymeric diet (EN group, n=49) and those without TPN
      and EN (NN group, n=12). A decrease in CDAI >or= 70 or a CDAI value <150 at 2
      weeks was regarded as effective. RESULTS: There was no difference in CDAI at
      baseline among the three groups. In each group, CDAI decreased significantly
      (from 250 (195-290) [median (interquartiles)] to 152 (123-233) in the TPN group, 
      p<0.0001; from 259 (200-325) to 180 (130-238) in the EN group, p<0.0001; from 278
      (222-291) to 164 (132-196) in the NN group, p=0.003). Infliximab was effective in
      63.9% of patients in the TPN group, in 55.1% of those in the EN group and in 75% 
      of the NN group. There was no statistical difference in efficacy among the three 
      groups (p=0.4). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed younger age to
      be a significant factor related to the efficacy of infliximab. CONCLUSIONS:
      Infliximab is effective in patients with CD under TPN or EN. Age at infliximab
      administration may be predictive of response to infliximab.

TI  - Bone loss in Crohn's disease: exercise as a potential countermeasure.
PG  - 1108-18
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with a number of secondary conditions
      including osteoporosis, which increases the risk of bone fracture. The cause of
      metabolic bone disease in this population is believed to be multifactorial and
      may include the disease itself and associated inflammation, high-dose
      corticosteroid use, weight loss and malabsorption, a lack of exercise and
      physical activity, and an underlying genetic predisposition to bone loss. Reduced
      bone mineral density has been reported in between 5% to 80% of CD sufferers,
      although it is generally believed that approximately 40% of patients suffer from 
      osteopenia and 15% from osteoporosis. Recent studies suggest a small but
      significantly increased risk of fracture compared with healthy controls and,
      perhaps, sufferers of other gastrointestinal disorders such as ulcerative
      colitis. The role of physical activity and exercise in the prevention and
      treatment of CD-related bone loss has received little attention, despite the
      benefits of specific exercises being well documented in healthy populations. This
      article reviews the prevalence of and risk factors for low bone mass in CD
      patients and examines various treatments for osteoporosis in these patients, with
      a particular focus on physical activity.

TI  - Short- and long-term therapeutic efficacy of nutritional therapy and
      corticosteroids in paediatric Crohn's disease.
PG  - 381-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Comparative data on the therapeutic efficacy of different enteral
      nutrition formulas and corticosteroids to obtain clinical remission and to induce
      mucosal healing influencing long-term disease course in paediatric Crohn's
      disease are still scarce. AIMS: To investigate the efficacy of nutritional
      therapy using three different formulas versus corticosteroids to achieve clinical
      remission as well as to induce intestinal mucosal healing in active Crohn's
      disease children. Duration of remission and effect on growth recovery were also
      assessed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical, laboratory, endoscopic and histological
      data of all new diagnosed active Crohn's disease paediatric cases were
      retrospectively recorded and reviewed. Thirty-seven children (median age 12.1
      years) received nutritional therapy (12 polymeric; 13 semi-elemental; 12
      elemental diet) and 10 subjects (median age 12.4 years) received corticosteroids.
      RESULTS: Similar clinical remission rate were observed after 8 weeks of
      treatment: 86.5% children receiving nutritional therapy versus 90% treated with
      corticosteroids. Improvement in mucosal inflammation occurred in 26 out of 37
      (64.8%) patients on nutritional therapy and in 4 out of 10 (40%) children on
      steroids (p < 0.05). Finally, seven subjects on nutritional therapy and none on
      corticosteroids achieved complete mucosal healing (p < 0.005) at the end of the
      treatment. Nutritional therapy was more effective than corticosteroids in
      improving nutritional status and linear growth recovery. Compared to
      corticosteroids, the duration of clinical remission was longer in the nutritional
      therapy groups without differences among the three different formulas.
      CONCLUSIONS: In children with active Crohn's disease, nutritional therapy is more
      effective than corticosteroids to improve intestinal inflammation and to maintain
      a more sustained clinical remission.

TI  - Significance of salicylate intolerance in diseases of the lower gastrointestinal 
      tract.
PG  - 89-102
AB  - Salicylate intolerance is defined as a nonspecific antigen-induced
      pseudo-allergic hypersensitivity reaction which can occur upon contact of an
      organism with salicylic acid, its derivatives or other related organic or
      inorganic acids of similar chemical structure. Since the effects of nonsteroidal 
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) intolerance are by no means always severe or
      life-endangering but may just as well present as oligosymptomatic or local
      disorders (e.g. abdominal pain, diarrhea, we decided to evaluate the
      characteristics of patients with salicylate intolerance on the basis of
      gastroenterological case material of Medical Department I of Erlangen University.
      On the basis of the findings from the Erlangen interdisciplinary data register of
      chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal disease, the signs and symptoms of NSAID
      intolerance were found to constitute a diagnosis of great practical import to
      clinical medicine (allergology, dermatology, immunology, other disorders etc.)
      including gastroenterology. For approx. 2-7% of all patients with inflammatory
      bowel syndrome and food allergies this poses a new diagnostic and therapeutic
      challenge which may concern physicians from any of the disciplines involved. When
      presented with patients with chronic active disease who are suffering from these 
      symptoms one should, therefore, in future give greater thought to the possibility
      of salicylate intolerance, all the more as there are meaningful dietetic,
      diagnostic and therapeutic options available for these persons.

TI  - Role of perioperative parenteral nutrition in severely malnourished patients with
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 5732-4
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the effect of perioperative parenteral nutrition on serum
      immunoglobulin, weight change, and post-operative outcome in severely
      malnourished patients with Crohn's disease. METHODS: Thirty-two severely
      malnourished patients with Crohn's disease who had undergone surgery in our
      hospital were reviewed. Sixteen patients who received perioperative parenteral
      nutrition were enrolled in the study group, and the other 16 patients who did not
      receive parenteral nutrition were enrolled in the control group. Serum
      immunoglobulin, body mass index (BMI), liver function, weight change, and
      postoperative complications were evaluated. RESULTS: Serum IgM levels elevated 1 
      wk before surgery in both groups, and decreased to normal value (from 139+/-41 to
      105+/-29 mg/dL, P = 0.04) 4 wk after operation in the study group, while no
      significant changes was noted in the control group (from 133+/-16 to 129+/-13
      mg/dL, P = 0.34). There were no significant changes in concentrations of IgG and 
      IgA. The BMI of the study group increased from 13.9+/-0.6 to 15.3+/-0.7 kg/m(2)
      (P = 0.02) with no significant change in the control group (14.1+/-0.7 and
      14.5+/-0.5, respectively, P = 0.81). The percentage of resuming work was higher
      in the study group than in the control group. CONCLUSION: Perioperative
      parenteral nutrition possibly ameliorates the humoral immunity, reverses
      malnutrition, and facilitates rehabilitation.

TI  - Practical guide to intestinal rehabilitation for postresection intestinal
      failure: a case study.
PG  - 551-8
AB  - After massive small-intestinal resection or combined small-intestinal and colonic
      resection, diarrhea with resulting dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, and
      malnutrition occur. Many patients become dependent on IV fluids and nutrition. An
      adaptation process manifested clinically by decreased diarrhea and improved
      nutrient absorption according to decreased parenteral nutrition and fluid
      requirements has been noted to occur over time. In some patients, adaptation is
      inadequate and may require special techniques to enhance and augment this
      process. This is a case of a 52-year-old woman who experienced increased stoma
      output 1 week after major intestinal resection, resulting in dehydration. She
      required IV fluids in order to maintain hydration. After the initiation of an
      intestinal rehabilitation program, which included modified diet, soluble fiber,
      oral rehydration solution (ORS), and medications, IV fluids were successfully
      weaned off in 3 months. She continues not to receive IV fluids and continues to
      follow the intestinal rehabilitation plan.

TI  - Treatment of active Crohn's disease in children using partial enteral nutrition
      with liquid formula: a randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 356-61
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Total enteral nutrition (TEN) with a liquid formula can
      suppress gut inflammation and induce remission in active Crohn's disease. The
      mechanism is obscure. Studies have suggested that long term nutritional
      supplementation with a liquid formula (partial enteral nutrition (PEN)) may also 
      suppress inflammation and prevent relapse. The aim of this study was to compare
      PEN with conventional TEN in active Crohn's disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty 
      children with a paediatric Crohn's disease activity index (PCDAI)>20 were
      randomly assigned to receive 50% (PEN) or 100% (TEN) of their energy requirement 
      as elemental formula for six weeks. The PEN group was encouraged to eat an
      unrestricted diet while those receiving TEN were not allowed to eat. The primary 
      outcome was achievement of remission (PCDAI<10). Secondary analyses of changes in
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C reactive protein, albumin, and platelets 
      were performed to look for evidence of anti-inflammatory effects. RESULTS:
      Remission rate with PEN was lower than with TEN (15% v 42%; p=0.035). Although
      PCDAI fell in both groups (p=0.001 for both), the reduction was greater with TEN 
      (p=0.005). Moreover, the fall in PCDAI with PEN was due to symptomatic and
      nutritional benefits. With both treatments there were significant improvements in
      relation to abdominal pain, "sense of wellbeing", and nutritional status.
      However, only TEN led to a reduction in diarrhoea (p=0.02), an increase in
      haemoglobin and albumin, and a fall in platelets and ESR. CONCLUSIONS: TEN
      suppresses inflammation in active Crohn's disease but PEN does not. This suggests
      that long term nutritional supplementation, although beneficial to some patients,
      is unlikely to suppress inflammation and so prevent disease relapse.

TI  - Energy intakes of children with Crohn's disease treated with enteral nutrition as
      primary therapy.
PG  - 337-42
AB  - BACKGROUND: Enteral nutrition (EN) is widely used and is effective in the
      treatment of children with Crohn's disease given as an exclusive feed for 6-8
      weeks. Current dietetic practice during EN is to recommend an energy intake based
      on estimated average requirement (EAR) for energy for age. AIMS: To examine
      factors affecting energy intake and weight gain during EN in relation to disease 
      site and nutritional status. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study examining
      energy intake and weight gain during the exclusive EN feeding period in 40
      patients newly diagnosed with Crohn's in relation to EAR, nutritional status,
      disease site. RESULTS: All patients improved clinically and gained weight during 
      EN with improvement in the CRP as a marker of the systemic inflammatory response.
      Energy intake was higher than EAR in 82% (33/40 patients), with the median 117.5%
      of EAR. Weight gain correlated with body mass index standard deviation score (P =
      0.001) at start of treatment, but not energy intake or CRP. CONCLUSION: Estimated
      average requirement underestimates energy intakes in most children with newly
      diagnosed Crohn's disease. During EN, an energy intake in the range of 100-149%
      (median 117.5%) EAR for energy for age may be required. Energy balance studies in
      children with active disease are required.

TI  - High-dose fish oil and antioxidants in Crohn's disease and the response of bone
      turnover: a randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 253-61
AB  - Crohn's disease is associated with altered bone turnover that may be influenced
      by nutritional status, the systemic inflammatory response, cytokine production by
      circulating (peripheral blood) mononuclear cells (PBMC) and antioxidant
      micronutrient intake. High-dose fish oil is associated with reductions in disease
      relapse and inflammatory markers, and modulates PBMC function. The effect of fish
      oil plus antioxidants on bone turnover and PBMC function (the production of
      interferon-gamma and prostaglandin E2) in Crohn's disease was investigated in a
      randomised-controlled trial. Patients with currently or recently raised
      biochemical markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein > or = 6.9 mg/l or
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate > or =18 mm/h) received fish oil (providing 2.7
      g/d EPA and DHA) and antioxidants (vitamins A, C and E, and Se) (n 31) or placebo
      (n 30) for 24 weeks. Bone turnover was assessed by measuring the concentrations
      of urinary deoxypyridinoline (bone resorption) and serum osteocalcin (bone
      formation). Fish oil plus antioxidants were associated with increases in EPA, DHA
      Se in plasma (all P < 0.01), and with a reduction in interferon-gamma production 
      by mitogen-stimulated PBMC, which demonstrated a negative correlation with
      deoxypyridinoline/creatinine:osteocalcin ratio (r - 0.33, P = 0.009). There were 
      no differences between the groups at 24 weeks in the response of
      deoxypyridinoline or osteocalcin or their ratio, or in nutritional status.
      Dietary supplementation in Crohn's disease with high intakes of EPA and DHA, as
      fish oil, plus antioxidants was associated with a modulated production of
      interferon-gamma by PBMC but not altered indices of bone turnover.

TI  - [Nutritional treatment in childhood Crohn's disease].
PG  - 1255-66
AB  - Growth retardation and delay in sexual maturation are the major complications of 
      child-onset Crohn's disease (CD). Nutritional assessment and monitoring should
      comprise: weight and height measurement with calculation of respective velocities
      (growth velocity should be > or = 4-5 cm/year during the prepubertal period);
      pubertal staging; dietetic evaluation; laboratory analysis for mineral, vitamin
      and trace element deficiencies; bone age. At diagnosis, weight loss and growth
      delay are present in 80-90% and 1/3 of cases, respectively. In case of an acute
      flare-up in a CD child with normal nutritional status, nutritional therapy is
      limited to oral feeding, with a caloric intake at least equal to recommended
      dietary allowances for age and sex. A low-fiber diet is advised in case of small 
      bowel stenosis. No diet has been shown as efficient in the long-term maintenance 
      of remission. Exclusive enteral nutrition (EN) is an alternative to
      corticosteroids for the treatment of an acute flare-up of CD, especially in case 
      of malnutrition. Prolonged nocturnal EN is of great interest for the treatment of
      growth retardation and delay of sexual maturation and in case of
      steroid-dependent or steroid-refractory CD. In case of steroid-dependent CD with 
      no delay of growth and/or sexual maturation, immunomodulating agents are nowadays
      an alternative to long-term EN. Efficacy of polymeric solutions is identical to
      that of semi-elemental or elemental solutions. Parenteral nutrition is limited to
      an acute flare-up with resistance to medical treatment and/or EN, and
      contraindications to surgery; occlusion or fistula; short bowel syndrome.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review reports on the recent progress understanding
      mechanisms of action and clinical applications of probiotics. RECENT FINDINGS:
      New insights on regulating mechanisms of intestinal commensal bacteria to prevent
      and treat different gastrointestinal diseases have been reported. Some
      probiotics, though not all, exert beneficial effects by modulating the mucosal
      barrier function and immune activity. It seems that a combination of different
      probiotics is more effective than a single strain. It was demonstrated that not
      only viable bacteria administered to the intestinal tract but also isolated
      probiotic DNA is active, even if injected subcutaneously. There is reasonable
      evidence to recommend probiotics in infectious diarrhoea for prevention and
      treatment (mainly in children) and to prevent antibiotic-induced gastrointestinal
      side effects. Furthermore, probiotics are effective in maintaining remission in
      ulcerative colitis and preventing and treating pouchitis. Promising positive
      effects were published in major surgery patients (gastric resection, pancreatic
      resection, liver transplantation) and in severe necrotising acute pancreatitis.
      SUMMARY: Increasing knowledge on probiotics is exciting, but in the near future
      it must be defined which probiotics (single strains or a combination) are most
      effective in specific diseases. Well-designed, randomized clinical trials are
      still required to further define the role of probiotics as preventive and
      therapeutic agents.

TI  - Enteral nutrition and microflora in pediatric Crohn's disease.
PG  - S173-5; discussion S175-8, S184-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EN) is an established primary therapy
      for pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). The mechanism of action of such treatment is 
      still conjectural. The aim of the present study was to investigate if EN-induced 
      remission is associated with modification of the fecal microflora in CD. METHODS:
      Stool samples were collected from 5 healthy children and adolescents over a
      period of 3 months, and from 9 children and adolescents with active CD. To induce
      disease remission, children with CD received a course of exclusive EN for 8 weeks
      with a polymeric formula (Modulen IBD, Nestle). At the end of the course of
      exclusive EN, children returned to a free diet but continued to take 40% of the
      daily caloric intake as polymeric formula. Fecal microflora was analyzed by 16S
      ribosomal DNA polymerase chain reaction and temperature gradient gel
      electrophoresis (TGGE) with direct visual comparison of band profiles of PCR
      products. RESULTS: In 8 of 9 children, the exclusive EN alone induced disease
      remission. In 1 child, it was necessary to add steroids to the exclusive EN
      course to achieve remission. In all children with CD, analysis of gel band
      distribution revealed profound modification of the fecal microflora after
      exclusive EN. Variations of band distribution corresponding to different
      bacterial species were observed also in children on partial EN and required time 
      to achieve stability of the band profile. In contrast, control healthy children
      showed a host-specific and stable TGGE profile over time. CONCLUSION: These data 
      suggest that a possible mechanism of action of EN in inducing disease remission
      in CD is the capacity of modification of gut microflora. Possible explanations of
      such capacity are both low residue and prebiotic properties of the polymeric
      liquid formula.

TI  - Control of systemic and local inflammation with transforming growth factor beta
      containing formulas.
PG  - S126-8; discussion S129-33, S184-8
AB  - Enteral nutrition therapy with liquid diet has been shown to be effective in
      achieving clinical remission in intestinal Crohn's disease. The mechanism of
      action of this therapy, however, is still poorly understood. As part of our
      assessment of the action of 3 related polymeric enteral therapies, we have used a
      variety of techniques to document the histological and cytokine responses, in the
      mucosa and, systemically, to these treatments. The feeds studied (AL110, Modulen 
      IBD and ACD004 [Nestle, Vevey, Switzerland]) all have casein as the protein
      source, are lactose free and are rich in transforming growth factor beta
      (TGF-beta). They have all been shown to induce clinical remission associated with
      mucosal healing. In the case of Modulen IBD, as well as mucosal macroscopic and
      histological healing there was a fall in mucosal proinflammatory cytokines:
      interleukin-1 mRNA in colonic and ileal, interleukin-8 mRNA in the colon and
      interferon gamma mRNA in the ileum, but a rise in the regulatory cytokine
      TGF-beta mRNA in the ileum. These results indicate that these formulas are
      influencing the disease process itself, and thus suggest that the clinical
      remission achieved is a result of a reduction in inflammation, rather than a
      consequence of some other nutrition effect.

TI  - Immunopathogenesis of Crohn's disease.
PG  - S118-24; discussion S124-5, S184-8
AB  - This review highlights the huge advances made in the understanding of Crohn's
      disease in the last 15 years. The pathogenic immune response in the gut wall is a
      highly polarised T helper cell type 1 response, probably directed against
      antigens of the commensal flora. There is marked over-expression of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and
      increased production of matrix degrading enzymes by fibroblasts and macrophages, 
      which are probably responsible for ulceration and fistula formation. Crohn's
      disease runs in families and the susceptibility genes identified so far are
      associated with innate recognition of microbial products (Nod2) or epithelial
      barrier function (OCTN cation transporter genes and DLG5). Endogenous healing
      pathways mediated by transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 are inhibited because
      mucosal inflammatory cells express Smad7, the endogenous intracellular inhibitor 
      of TGF-beta signalling. This makes it unlikely that enteral feeds containing
      TFG-beta are therapeutic by means of direct anti-inflammatory effects, however
      TGF-beta may still be involved because it is a well known epithelial motogen and 
      may promote mucosal healing, in synergy with changes in mucosal bacterial
      populations as a result of the change in the diet.

TI  - High prevalence of celiac disease among patients affected by Crohn's disease.
PG  - 662-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent literature has shown a correlation between Crohn's disease
      (CD) and celiac disease, but a prospective study has not been performed. Our aim 
      was to evaluate the prevalence of celiac disease in a consecutive series of
      patients affected by CD, in whom the disease was diagnosed for the first time.
      METHODS: From January to December 2004, we diagnosed 27 patients affected by CD
      (13 men and 14 women; mean age, 32.3 yrs; range, 16-69 yrs). In all patients, we 
      performed antigliadin, antiendomysium, and antitransglutaminase antibody tests,
      and the sorbitol H2 breath test evaluation. In case of antibodies and/or sorbitol
      positivity, esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed for a small bowel biopsy.
      RESULTS: Antigliadin, antiendomysium, and antitransglutaminase antibody tests
      were positive in 8/27 (29.63%), 4/27 (14.81%), and 5/27 (18.52%) patients,
      respectively, whereas the sorbitol H2 breath test was positive in 11/27 (40.74%) 
      patients: all of them underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Nine of 11 patients
      showed signs of duodenal endoscopic damage, and 5/9 (55.55%) showed histologic
      features of celiac disease (18.52% of overall CD population studied): 2 showed
      Marsh IIIc lesions (1 patient affected by ileal CD and 1 affected by ileo-colonic
      CD), 2 showed Marsh IIIb lesions (all of them affected by ileo-colonic CD), 1
      showed a Marsh IIIa lesion (1 patient affected by colonic CD). CONCLUSIONS:
      Prevalence of celiac disease seems to be high among patients affected by CD, and 
      this finding should be kept in mind at the time of the first diagnosis of CD; a
      gluten-free diet should be promptly started.

TI  - Personal view: food for thought--western lifestyle and susceptibility to Crohn's 
      disease. The FODMAP hypothesis.
PG  - 1399-409
AB  - Susceptibility to the development of Crohn's disease involves a combination of
      genetic and environmental factors. The association of Crohn's disease with
      westernization has implicated lifestyle factors in pathogenesis. While diet is a 
      likely candidate, evidence for specific changes in dietary habits and/or intake
      has been lacking. A new hypothesis is proposed, by which excessive delivery of
      highly fermentable but poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrates and polyols
      (designated FODMAPs--Fermentable Oligo-, Di- and Mono-saccharides And Polyols) to
      the distal small intestinal and colonic lumen is a dietary factor underlying
      susceptibility to Crohn's disease. The subsequent rapid fermentation of FODMAPs
      in the distal small and proximal large intestine induces conditions in the bowel 
      that lead to increased intestinal permeability, a predisposing factor to the
      development of Crohn's disease. Evidence supporting this hypothesis includes the 
      increasing intake of FODMAPs in western societies, the association of increased
      intake of sugars in the development of Crohn's disease, and the previously
      documented effects of the ingestion of excessive FODMAPs on the bowel. This
      hypothesis provides potential for the design of preventive strategies and raises 
      concern about current enthusiasm for putative health-promoting effects of
      FODMAPs. One of the greatest challenges in defining the pathogenesis of Crohn's
      disease is to identify predisposing environmental factors. Such an achievement
      might lead to the development of preventive strategies for, and the definition
      of, possible target for changing the natural history of this serious disease. The
      present paper describes a new hypothesis for one such environmental factor.

TI  - Impact of elemental diet on mucosal inflammation in patients with active Crohn's 
      disease: cytokine production and endoscopic and histological findings.
PG  - 580-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine the impact of elemental diet on 
      mucosal inflammation in Crohn's disease (CD), mainly by cytokine measurements.
      METHODS: Twenty-eight consecutive patients with active CD were treated with an
      elemental diet (Elental) for 4 weeks. The mucosal biopsies were obtained from the
      terminal ileum and large bowel before and after treatment. As a control group,
      mucosal biopsies were obtained from 20 patients without inflammation. Mucosal
      cytokine concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
      RESULTS: After treatment, clinical remission was achieved in 20 patients (71%).
      Endoscopic healing and improvement rates were 44% and 76% in the terminal ileum
      and 39% and 78% in the large bowel, respectively. Histologic healing and
      improvement rates were 19% and 54% in the terminal ileum and 20% and 55% in the
      large bowel, respectively. Before treatment, the mucosal concentrations of
      interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), IL-6, IL-8, and tumor 
      necrosis factor-alpha in the ileum and large bowel were significantly higher than
      in controls. These cytokine concentrations decreased to the levels of control
      after treatment. IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio in the ileum and large bowel was
      significantly lower than in controls before treatment. The ratio increased to the
      level of controls after treatment. The endoscopic and histologic healing of the
      mucosal inflammation was associated with a decline of the mucosal cytokines and
      an increase of the IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio. CONCLUSIONS: The elemental diet
      (Elental) reduced mucosal cytokine production and corrected an imbalance between 
      proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in CD.

TI  - [Early detection of colorectal carcinoma. Pros and cons].
PG  - 26-8
AB  - Apart from a healthy diet and adequate exercise, early detection measures are
      applied in the prevention of colorectal. The hemoccult test continues to serve as
      a screening method. It it proves to be positive, a colonoscopic study should
      always be performed. Using this approach, 20-30% of polyps in the bowel and early
      cancer stages can be detected and removed as a prophylactic measure. The
      hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome (HNPCC) and familial
      adenomatous polyposis (FAP) yare the most important risk factors for the
      development of colorectal carcinoma. However, patients with Crohn's disease or
      ulcerative colitis also have a greatly increased risk and require more intensive 
      bowel cancer prophylaxis.

TI  - Laparoscopic-assisted ileo-colectomy for tuberculosis.
PG  - 986-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic-assisted colon resection (LACR) for benign disease has
      gained acceptance and has a lower morbidity than open surgery. Reports in Western
      literature have outlined the use of LACR for diverticulosis, ulcerative colitis, 
      and Crohn's disease. We evaluated the use of LACR in patients with ileo-cecal
      tuberculosis (IC-TB) and describe our technique and results. METHODS: Twenty-six 
      patients (20 F) between 16 and 45 years of age underwent a LACR for IC-TB over a 
      4-year period. Three access ports were used in 22 patients, four patients needed 
      four ports. The cecum, ascending colon, proximal transverse colon, and terminal
      ileum were mobilized completely. The right colic vessels were divided
      intracorporeally. The specimen was delivered using a 5- to 6-cm incision. The
      ileo-colic pedicle and bowel were divided outside and an ileocolic anastomosis
      performed. After placing the bowel within the abdomen the pneumoperitoneum was
      recreated, saline irrigation done, and hemostasis achieved. RESULTS: No patient
      needed a formal laparotomy. Peristalsis returned within 48 h in 19 patients and
      after 72 h in the remaining seven. Oral liquids were started on all patients by
      the 3rd postoperative day (POD) and a soft diet by the 5th POD. Twenty patients
      had a bowel movement by the 4th POD and the rest by the 5th POD. Eighteen
      patients were discharged by the 5th day and the remaining by the 7th day. Three
      patients developed wound sepsis. Twenty-one patients could resume normal activity
      within 2 weeks, the rest within a month. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic-assisted colon 
      resection seems to be an ideal operation for patients with ileo-cecal
      tuberculosis. It has minimal morbidity and allows a quick return to normal
      activity.

TI  - Serum selenoprotein-P levels in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 574-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Selenoprotein-P is a selenium-rich serum protein that carries more
      than 50% of serum selenium. We evaluated changes in serum selenoprotein-P levels 
      in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Serum selenoprotein-P
      levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Twenty healthy
      individuals (controls), 34 patients with ulcerative colitis, and 37 patients with
      Crohn's disease (CD) were studied. RESULTS: A highly significant correlation was 
      found between the serum selenium and selenoprotein-P levels. There was no
      significant difference in serum selenoprotein-P levels between healthy controls
      (average 3.4+/-0.8 microg/mL, n=20) and patients with ulcerative colitis
      (3.0+/-1.0 microg/mL, n=34). Serum selenoprotein-P levels were significantly
      lower in patients with CD (average 1.8+/-0.5 microg/mL, n=37). Serum
      selenoprotein-P levels were significantly lower in the elemental diet group of
      patients who had CD (average 1.4+/-0.4 microg/mL, n=17) than in the non-elemental
      diet group of patients who had CD (average 2.1+/-0.3 microg/mL, n=20).
      CONCLUSION: We found that the serum selenoprotein-P level is decreased in
      patients with CD. It may be a useful marker to monitor the systemic selenium
      status in various disorders.

AB  - We describe a 29-year-old woman presenting with chronic diarrhea, growth
      retardation, and primary amenorrhea who was diagnosed as having celiac disease
      coexisting with Crohn disease and Turner syndrome. The association of Turner
      syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and celiac disease is reviewed with
      insights into the genetics of immunologic disorders and possible chromosomal
      derangements leading to inflammatory bowel disease. To our knowledge, this is the
      first case of Crohn disease associated with celiac disease and Turner syndrome.

TI  - Environmental factors in familial Crohn's disease in Belgium.
PG  - 360-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Environmental factors are believed to trigger the onset of Crohn's
      disease (CD) in genetically susceptible individuals. The aim of this study was to
      assess environmental and familial factors that might be etiologically related to 
      CD. METHODS: Twenty-one families with 3 or more affected first-degree relatives
      were studied, together with 10 matched control families. There were 74 patients
      with CD, 84 unaffected family members, and 59 controls. Family members were
      interviewed together at the parental home. A 176-item questionnaire delved into
      first symptoms, childhood vaccinations and diseases, food items, potable water
      supplies, social activities, travel, pets, and home and surrounding environment. 
      Questions were directed specifically for 2 time-frames, childhood until age 20
      and a 10-year epoch before the onset of first symptoms within a family. The
      possible factors linked to disease were evaluated using univariate and
      multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: There were significantly more smokers 
      in the patients and their relatives than in controls. Patients had more
      appendicitis during adolescence, ate less oats, rye, and bran than controls, and 
      consumed more unpasteurized cheese. Patients drank significantly less tap water
      and more well water than controls. Clustering of cases in time occurred in 13 of 
      the 21 affected families. CONCLUSIONS: The less frequent consumption of oats,
      rye, and bran and the more frequent eating of unpasteurized cheeses imitate
      potential dietary influences on gastrointestinal flora. More importantly, our
      data suggest that the drinking of well water represents an important risk factor 
      for CD.

TI  - Terminal ileal stricture in Crohn's disease: treatment using a metallic enteral
      endoprosthesis.
PG  - 1081-5
AB  - Enteral strictures are a frequent indication for surgery in Crohn's disease.
      Postoperative complications are increased in patients with poor preoperative
      nutritional status, which is common in this patient population. We present a
      49-year-old female with longstanding Crohn's disease admitted to our Digestive
      Health Center with four weeks of increasing abdominal symptoms and radiographic
      evidence of small-bowel obstruction caused by ileal stricture. Given her poor
      nutritional status, our team elected to pursue metallic enteral stenting as a
      bridge to surgical resection. Two Wallstents were placed; luminal patency was
      subsequently confirmed by a fluoroscopic study. The patient tolerated regular
      diet and was discharged. When seen in follow-up, she remained asymptomatic and
      wished to defer surgical intervention indefinitely.

PG  - 102-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malnutrition is a common sequela of Crohn's disease (CD) and may
      result in reduced skeletal muscle function and growth retardation. Energy
      requirements of parenterally fed hospitalized pediatric patients with active CD
      were measured using indirect calorimetry, to assess whether Food Agriculture
      Organization (FAO)/World Health Organization (WHO)/United Nations University
      (UNU) equations provide appropriate estimations of energy requirements in this
      patient population. METHODS: Twenty hospitalized patients with active CD fed
      exclusively via parenteral nutrition (PN) were investigated. A chart review and
      patient interviews were conducted to assess disease duration, location,
      laboratory parameters, and symptomology associated with CD. Disease severity was 
      quantified using the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index. Each subject
      underwent indirect calorimetry, bioelectrical impedance analysis, and
      anthropometric assessment once the ordered PN met estimated macronutrient
      requirements of each patient (predicted resting energy expenditure x1.3).
      Predicted resting energy expenditure (REE) was determined using the FAO/WHO/UNU
      equations. RESULTS: REE showed a strong correlation with predicted REE (r(2) =
      .73, p < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Measured REE did not significantly differ from
      predicted resting energy requirements. This indicates that REE for the
      parenterally fed pediatric patients with CD can be accurately predicted using the
      FAO/WHO/UNU equations.

TI  - Past and current theories of etiology of IBD: toothpaste, worms, and
      refrigerators.
PG  - S59-65
AB  - While tremendous advances have improved the understanding of inflammatory bowel
      disease, with regard to environmental risk factors as well as the biochemical
      nature of the inflammatory process, a determination of primary etiology remains
      elusive. Numerous theories have been proposed in the past century concerning the 
      cause of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis with implications for specific
      therapies. On further study, most of these ideas and therapies have failed to be 
      accurate in theory or therapeutic approach. Others remain untested or are the
      focus of current investigation and controversy. This paper reviews the dominant
      theories of primary etiology. These hypotheses include infectious causes such as 
      Mycobacteria paratuberculosis and measles. Allergic and nutritionally related
      causes have been the focus of considerable research. Microparticles, which is
      part of the concept behind toothpaste as a cause, have been suggested more
      broadly to be the principal factor initiating Crohn's disease. Several of these
      concepts rely on the idea that there is an increased intestinal permeability that
      is the central defect leading to Crohn's disease. Rather than being an excessive 
      T cell driven process, Crohn's has been suggested to be an innate immune
      deficiency, leading to the use of colony stimulating factors to augment the
      intestinal barrier function and innate immunity. A variety of changes in the gut 
      flora, ranging from a basic dysbiosis to the absence of helminths, have been
      proposed as the root cause of inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - [Energy losses from a short bowel: not only fat].
PG  - 381-4
AB  - Two adult patients, men aged 43 and 45 years, with Crohn's disease, complicated
      by high-output small-bowel-stomy and short-bowel syndrome due to several
      intestinal resections, presented with extreme weight loss. Although both patients
      followed a high-calorie diet combining solid foods and enteral nutrition by
      nasogastric tube, containing 16,000 kJ and 21,000 kJ, respectively, weight loss
      continued. Faecal fat excretion and basal metabolic rate were determined, but
      these could not explain the caloric deficit. Therefore, faecal bomb calorimetry, 
      a measurement of total faecal energy content, was also performed, revealing a
      considerably higher faecal energy loss than had been calculated from faecal fat
      excretion; this indicates that faecal carbohydrate loss plays an important
      supplementary role. A stable weightwas achieved in both patients by prescribing
      extra food. Therefore, faecal fat excretion is an insufficient indicator of total
      faecal calorie loss in patients with high-output stomata and short-bowel
      syndrome. Bomb calorimetry may be considered as a tool to determine the remaining
      absorptive capacity in short-bowel patients.

TI  - Altered bone mass in children at diagnosis of Crohn disease: a pilot study.
PG  - 295-300
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Recent studies have indicated that bone mineral density is reduced in
      children with inflammatory bowel disease. The exact cause of this reduction is
      unclear, but it is often attributed to corticosteroid use. This study examined
      the prevalence of reduced bone mass in otherwise healthy children newly diagnosed
      with Crohn disease without previous corticosteroid exposure. METHODS: Eighteen
      steroid-naive children newly diagnosed with Crohn disease underwent dual energy
      x-ray absorptiometry. Disease activity, growth and pubertal development,
      nutritional assessment and bone mass measurements were recorded. z scores were
      adjusted for bone age. RESULTS: Five of the 18 patients (28%) had a total bone
      mineral density z score less than -1 (one had a z score less than -2). Ten (56%) 
      subjects had lumbar spine bone mineral density z scores less than -1 (two had z
      score less than -2). The subjects had significantly reduced mean lumbar spine
      bone mineral density z scores (P = 0.002). Delayed pubertal development
      correlated with whole body bone mineral density z scores (r = 0.64; P = 0.004).
      Most subjects were not meeting United States recommended dietary allowances for
      daily intake of calcium, vitamin D and total calories. The majority of subjects
      were not participating in weight-bearing physical activity. CONCLUSION: Decreased
      bone mass is common in steroid naive children newly diagnosed with Crohn disease.
      Crohn disease appears to contribute to impaired bone mass independent of
      corticosteroid therapy.

TI  - Amount of systemic steroid medication is a strong predictor for the use of
      complementary and alternative medicine in patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease: results from a German national survey.
PG  - 287-95
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have suggested that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      patients rank high among users of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM).
      To further elucidate this phenomenon, we sent questionnaires to a large sample of
      IBD patients in Germany to determine the patterns and predictors of their CAM
      use. METHODS: Pretested 73-item questionnaires were mailed to a randomly selected
      representative sample of 1000 IBD patients from the approximately 16,000 members 
      and associates of the German Crohn's and Colitis Association. Predictors of CAM
      use were evaluated by logistic regression models. RESULTS: Completed
      questionnaires were returned by 684 patients (female patients, 61.4%; Crohn's
      disease patients, 58.3%; ulcerative colitis patients, 38.2%). Of the 671 adult
      respondents, 344 (51.3%) had experience with CAM, and significantly more of the
      ulcerative colitis patients (59.8%) than the Crohn's disease patients (48.3%) had
      experience with CAM. There was no difference by gender. Homeopathy (52.9%) and
      herbal medicine (43.6%) were the most commonly used types of CAM. The most
      frequent personal reasons for CAM use were the search for an "optimum treatment" 
      (78.9%) and the wish to stop taking steroids (63.8%). Using logistic regression, 
      we found that total cortisone intake (P = 0.0077), but not duration of disease,
      was a strong predictor of CAM use. Other predictors were experience with
      psychosomatic and psychotherapeutic support (P = 0.0029), relaxation techniques
      (P = 0.0284), an academic education (P = 0.0173), a diet utilizing whole grains
      (P = 0.0123), and a normal body weight (P = 0.0215). Although 80% of patients
      indicated that they were interested in using CAM in the future, only 24.7% felt
      sufficiently informed about it. CONCLUSIONS: More than 50% of a large group of
      German IBD patients had used CAM. Prolonged or intensive steroid treatment, an
      academic education, active ways of coping, and a health-conscious life-style are 
      associated with CAM use. Given the potential side effects and interactions, the
      treating physician should focus on thorough information about the benefits and
      limitations of conventional and complementary treatment options, especially for
      IBD patients who have received prolonged or intensive steroid treatment.

TI  - Lack of efficacy of a reduced microparticle diet in a multi-centred trial of
      patients with active Crohn's disease.
PG  - 377-84
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Dietary microparticles, which are bacteria-sized and
      non-biological, found in the modern Western diet, have been implicated in both
      the aetiology and pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Following on from the findings
      of a previous pilot study, we aimed to confirm whether a reduction in the amount 
      of dietary microparticles facilitates induction of remission in patients with
      active Crohn's disease, in a single-blind, randomized, multi-centre, placebo
      controlled trial. METHODS: Eighty-three patients with active Crohn's disease were
      randomly allocated in a 2 x 2 factorial design to a diet low or normal in
      microparticles and/or calcium for 16 weeks. All patients received a reducing dose
      of prednisolone for 6 weeks. Outcome measures were Crohn's disease activity
      index, Van Hees index, quality of life and a series of objective measures of
      inflammation including erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein,
      intestinal permeability and faecal calprotectin. After 16 weeks patients returned
      to their normal diet and were followed up for a further 36 weeks. RESULTS:
      Dietary manipulation provided no added effect to corticosteroid treatment on any 
      of the outcome measures during the dietary trial (16 weeks) or follow-up (to 1
      year); e.g., for logistic regression of Crohn's disease activity index based
      rates of remission (P=0.1) and clinical response (P=0.8), in normal versus low
      microparticle groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our adequately powered and carefully
      controlled dietary trial found no evidence that reducing microparticle intake
      aids remission in active Crohn's disease.

TI  - Environmental risk factors in paediatric inflammatory bowel diseases: a
      population based case control study.
PG  - 357-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: Environmental exposures in early life have been implicated in the
      aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease. OBJECTIVE: To examine environmental risk
      factors prior to the development of inflammatory bowel disease in a paediatric
      population based case control study. METHODS: A total of 222 incident cases of
      Crohn's disease and 60 incident cases of ulcerative colitis occurring before 17
      years of age between January 1988 and December 1997 were matched with one control
      subject by sex, age, and geographical location. We recorded 140 study variables
      in a questionnaire that covered familial history of inflammatory bowel disease,
      events during the perinatal period, infant and child diet, vaccinations and
      childhood diseases, household amenities, and the family's socioeconomic status.
      RESULTS: In a multivariate model, familial history of inflammatory bowel disease 
      (odds ratio (OR) 4.3 (95% confidence interval 2.3-8)), breast feeding (OR 2.1
      (1.3-3.4)), bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccination (OR 3.6 (1.1-11.9)), and history 
      of eczema (OR 2.1 (1-4.5)) were significant risk factors for Crohn's disease
      whereas regular drinking of tap water was a protective factor (OR 0.56 (0.3-1)). 
      Familial history of inflammatory bowel disease (OR 12.5 (2.2-71.4)), disease
      during pregnancy (OR 8.9 (1.5-52)), and bedroom sharing (OR 7.1 (1.9-27.4)) were 
      risk factors for ulcerative colitis whereas appendicectomy was a protective
      factor (OR 0.06 (0.01-0.36)). CONCLUSIONS: While family history and
      appendicectomy are known risk factors, changes in risk based on domestic
      promiscuity, certain vaccinations, and dietary factors may provide new
      aetiological clues.

TI  - Dietary risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease: a multicenter case-control
      study in Japan.
PG  - 154-63
AB  - To evaluate the role of dietary factors in the etiology of inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD), we conducted a multicenter hospital-based case-control study in a 
      Japanese population. Cases were IBD patients aged 15 to 34 years [ulcerative
      colitis (UC) 111 patients; Crohn's disease (CD) 128 patients] within 3 years
      after diagnosis in 13 hospitals. One control subject was recruited for each case 
      who was matched for sex, age, and hospital. A semiquantitative food frequency
      questionnaire was used to estimate preillness intakes of food groups and
      nutrients. All the available control subjects (n = 219) were pooled, and
      unconditional logistic models were applied to calculate odds ratios (ORs). In the
      food groups, a higher consumption of sweets was positively associated with UC
      risk [OR for the highest versus lowest quartile, 2.86; 95% confidence interval
      (CI), 1.24 to 6.57], whereas the consumption of sugars and sweeteners (OR, 2.12; 
      95% CI, 1.08 to 4.17), sweets (OR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.38 to 5.83), fats and oils
      (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.29 to 5.39), and fish and shellfish (OR, 2.41; 95% CI,
      1.18-4.89) were positively associated with CD risk. In respect to nutrients, the 
      intake of vitamin C (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.99) was negatively related to UC
      risk, while the intake of total fat (OR, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.39 to 5.90),
      monounsaturated fatty acids (OR, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.23 to 5.03) and polyunsaturated 
      fatty acids (OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.12 to 4.79), vitamin E (OR, 3.23; 95% CI, 1.45
      to 7.17), and n-3 (OR, 3.24; 95% CI, 1.52 to 6.88) and n-6 fatty acids (OR, 2.57;
      95% CI, 1.24 to 5.32) was positively associated with CD risk. Although this study
      suffers from the shortcoming of recall bias, which is inherent in most
      retrospective studies (prospective studies are warranted to confirm the
      associations between diet and IBD risk), the present findings suggest the
      importance of dietary factors for IBD prevention.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis: therapeutic implications.
PG  - 6-9
AB  - The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is complex, involving
      environmental, genetic, microbial, and immune factors. Therefore, treatment
      should target components that either predispose to or mediate the chronic
      inflammatory response of IBD. At the moment it is assumed that all components are
      necessary to have the typical manifestations of IBD but, in reality, it is
      unclear to what extent each factor contributes to the disease process, and
      whether some are more important than others. In addition, some factors are not
      practical targets; for example, environmental factors are poorly defined, too
      numerous, and require changes that cannot be implemented by the physician or the 
      patient alone. The same is true for genetic factors that are still not amenable
      to therapeutic manipulations for technical and ethical reasons. This leaves
      microbial and immune factors as the two categories that can be selected for
      therapeutic intervention and where all current treatments are focused. The
      commensal gut flora can be qualitatively or quantitatively modified with
      antibiotics, probiotics, or diet, and a better characterization of enteric
      bacteria strains should help greatly in developing more effective therapies. Most
      current drugs are focused on inhibiting pro-inflammatory molecules produced by
      immune cells, including biological agents that block specific cytokines such as
      tumor necrosis factor-alpha. It is anticipated that combination therapies
      targeting multiple pathogenic components will prove more effective than those
      blocking single components of IBD pathogenesis.

TI  - Prototypic disorders of gastrointestinal mucosal immune function: Celiac disease 
      and Crohn's disease.
PG  - 25-30
AB  - Celiac disease is a disorder of the small intestine characterized by chronic
      inflammation of the mucosa and protean clinical manifestations caused by loss of 
      tolerance to dietary antigens. Two strongly associated cofactors have been
      identified: the presence of HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 in the host and specific antigenic
      peptides in the diet that are present in wheat, rye, and barley. Most patients
      have complete remission after dietary elimination of these foods. Crohn's disease
      is characterized by chronic, relapsing, recurrent, focal, transmural inflammation
      of the gastrointestinal tract that can lead to multiple serious problems
      requiring chronic medical and surgical therapy. Crohn's disease is associated
      with multiple genetic mutations, at least one of which has been clearly
      implicated in innate immunity. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the
      disease involves abnormal immune responses to gut microbial flora.

TI  - Association of Crohn's disease and latent celiac disease: a case report and
      review of the literature.
PG  - 376-80
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the intestine
      potentially affecting all parts of the intestine with predilection sites in the
      terminal ileum and proximal colon. Its prevalence in Western Europe is
      20-40/100,000 with equal affection of both sexes and familiar accumulation.
      Histopathologically, it is characterized by a discontinuous, segmental
      manifestation and implication of all intestinal layers. Celiac disease, on the
      other hand, is defined by histologically proven villous atrophy associated with
      hyperplasia of crypts, lymphocytic infiltration and clinical improvement after a 
      gluten-free diet. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 52-year-old man presenting
      with long-term diarrhea and loss of weight associated with Crohn's disease. After
      interventional therapy for an unstable coronary artery syndrome and medical
      therapy for hyperthyroidism, the diarrhea stopped only after maintaining a
      gluten-free diet. A latent form of celiac disease (clinical symptoms, improvement
      after gluten-free diet, detection of anti-gliadin IgA antibodies, negative
      histology) was diagnosed. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first report 
      on the association of Crohn's disease and the latent form of celiac disease in
      the same patient. Whereas in most cases, Crohn's disease develops secondary to a 
      pre-existing celiac disease, in our patient, latent celiac disease was diagnosed 
      years after the onset of and therapy for Crohn's disease.
