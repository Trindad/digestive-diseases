TI  - Ability of commonly used prediction equations to predict resting energy
      expenditure in children with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1587-93
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21518 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Paediatric onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may cause
      alterations in energy requirements and invalidate the use of standard prediction 
      equations. Our aim was to evaluate four commonly used prediction equations for
      resting energy expenditure (REE) in children with IBD. METHODS: Sixty-three
      children had repeated measurements of REE as part of a longitudinal research
      study yielding a total of 243 measurements. These were compared with predicted
      REE from Schofield, Oxford, FAO/WHO/UNU, and Harris-Benedict equations using the 
      Bland-Altman method. RESULTS: Mean (+/-SD) age of the patients was 14.2 (2.4)
      years. Mean measured REE was 1566 (336) kcal per day compared with 1491 (236),
      1441 (255), 1481 (232), and 1435 (212) kcal per day calculated from Schofield,
      Oxford, FAO/WHO/UNU, and Harris-Benedict, respectively. While the Schofield
      equation demonstrated the least difference between measured and predicted REE,
      it, along with the other equations tested, did not perform uniformly across all
      subjects, indicating greater errors at either end of the spectrum of energy
      expenditure. Smaller differences were found for all prediction equations for
      Crohn's disease compared with ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Of the commonly
      used equations, the equation of Schofield should be used in pediatric patients
      with IBD when measured values are not able to be obtained.

AB  - Although providing necessary information to patients with Crohn disease (CD) can 
      influence their quality of life, there has been no study regarding the
      information provided by healthcare providers to CD patients. The aim of our study
      was to describe the contents of brochures given to CD patients in Japanese
      hospitals. These brochures were compared with ones used in the United States,
      Canada, and the United Kingdom. Forty-nine members of the research group on
      inflammatory bowel disease in Japan were asked to answer a questionnaire
      regarding educational brochures for CD patients. We obtained 15 Japanese and
      three foreign brochures and conducted content analyses for seven global
      brochures. We received 34 replies. Only 15 (44%) of 34 hospitals gave the
      brochures to all newly diagnosed CD patients. In the Japanese brochures, a lot of
      content was devoted to nutrition therapy and self-management in terms of diet. On
      the contrary, foreign brochures devoted more content to symptoms and drug
      therapy. The existing approaches for providing information in Japanese hospitals 
      were unsatisfactory. Furthermore, Japanese educational brochures for CD patients 
      emphasized nutritional therapy and dietary restriction. This reflected the
      differences in treatment strategies among countries.

AB  - CONTEXT: Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA), considered serologic
      markers for Crohn's disease, were described in patients with celiac disease,
      disappearing after a gluten-free diet. OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of ASCA positivity 
      in patients with Crohn's disease and celiac disease in relation to healthy
      individuals. METHODS: A total of 145 individuals were studied: 36 with Crohn's
      disease and 52 with celiac disease, that fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for
      both affections, and 57 healthy individuals for control. The celiac patients were
      divided as follow: group CeD I at diagnosis (n = 34), group CeD II with
      gluten-free diet compliance (n = 13) and group CeD III with transgressions to the
      diet (n = 5). ASCA IgA and IgG were determined by ELISA. RESULTS: With
      statistical significance, ASCA IgA were positive in Crohn's disease, celiac
      disease at diagnosis and celiac disease with diet transgressions; ASCA IgG in
      Crohn's disease and in all groups with celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: The detection
      of ASCA in patients with celiac disease allows to suggest that ASCA is not a
      specific marker for Crohn's disease, but was associated with the inflammation of 
      the small intestine. The increased levels of positive ASCA may be due to genetic 
      factors and increased intestinal permeability.

TI  - Association of adherence to therapy and complementary and alternative medicine
      use with demographic factors and disease phenotype in patients with inflammatory 
      bowel disease.
PG  - 283-90
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2009.11.011 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Previous studies have suggested an increasing use of
      complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in patients with inflammatory bowel 
      disease (IBD). Furthermore, a significant number of IBD patients fail to comply
      with treatment. The aim of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of
      non-adherence and the use of CAM in Hungarian patients with IBD. METHODS: A total
      of 655 consecutive IBD patients (CD: 344, age: 38.2 [SD 12.9]years; UC: 311, age:
      44.9 [15.3]years) were interviewed during the specialist visit by
      self-administered questionnaire including demographic and disease-related data as
      well as items analyzing the extent of non-adherence and CAM use. Patients taking 
      more than 80% of each prescribed medication were classified as adherent. RESULTS:
      The overall rate of self-reported non-adherence (CD: 20.9%, UC: 20.6%) and CAM
      (CD: 31.7%, UC: 30.9%) use did not differ between Crohn's disease (CD) and
      ulcerative colitis (UC). The most common causes of non-adherence were:
      forgetfulness (47.8%), too many/unnecessary pills (39.7%), being afraid of side
      effects (27.9%) and too frequent dosing. Most common forms of CAM were herbal tea
      (47.3%), homeopathy (14.6%), special diet (12.2%), and acupuncture (5.8%). In CD,
      disease duration, date of last follow-up visit, educational level and previous
      surgeries were predicting factors for non-adherence. Alternative medicine use was
      associated in both diseases with younger age, higher educational level, and
      immunosuppressant use. In addition, CAM use in UC was more common in females and 
      in patients with supportive psychiatric/psychological therapy. CONCLUSIONS:
      Non-adherence and CAM use is common in patients with IBD. Special attention
      should be paid to explore the identified predictive factors during follow-up
      visits to improve adherence to therapy and improving patient-doctor relationship.

AB  - This is a report concerning human polyomavirus JC (JCV) reactivation in a
      pediatric patient with Crohn's disease (CD) during the treatment with
      5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). We
      examined 9 bioptic samples from three different bowel districts (ileum, cecum,
      rectum) of this child. These samples were analyzed by Quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) to
      investigate the presence of JCV DNA. JCV DNA was detected in one rectum biopsy
      taken two months after 5-ASA treatment. Although our result must be validated in 
      a larger group of subjects and with a longer follow-up period, it underlines the 
      importance of JVC monitoring in CD patients.

TI  - Epidemiologic clues to inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 495-501
LID - 10.1007/s11894-010-0144-x [doi]
AB  - In this article, the recent literature exploring the epidemiology of inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) is reviewed. Epidemiologic studies present data on disease
      burden, but may also provide clues to disease etiology. The emergence of IBD in
      developing nations warrants a systematic search for environmental changes in
      those countries to explain the evolution of IBD. The hygiene hypothesis suggests 
      that an alteration in the microbial environment experienced by the host
      facilitates the evolution of chronic immune-mediated diseases. One complex
      database study suggested that areas with high species richness of human
      intestinal helminthes are areas with genetic changes in interleukin gene loci. In
      other words, over the years, the microbial ecology has affected human genetics,
      which in turn would have an impact on immune responses. Other factors affect the 
      gut microbiome, and several studies have explored the increase in incidence of
      IBD in relation to such factors as exogenous infections, use of antibiotics, and 
      diet.

TI  - Differences in gut microbial metabolism are responsible for reduced hippurate
      synthesis in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 108
LID - 10.1186/1471-230X-10-108 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Certain urinary metabolites are the product of gut microbial or
      mammalian metabolism; others, such as hippurate, are mammalian-microbial
      'co-metabolites'. It has previously been observed that Crohn's disease (CD)
      patients excrete significantly less hippurate than controls. There are two stages
      in the biosynthesis of this metabolite: 1) gut microbial metabolism of dietary
      aromatic compounds to benzoate, and 2) subsequent hepatorenal conjugation of
      benzoate with glycine, forming hippurate. Differences in such urinary
      co-metabolites may therefore reflect systemic consequences of altered gut
      microbial metabolism, though altered host metabolic pathways may also be
      involved. METHODS: It was hypothesised that reduced hippurate excretion in CD
      patients was due to alterations in the gut microbiota, and not differences in
      dietary benzoate, nor defective host enzymatic conjugation of benzoate. 5 mg/kg
      sodium benzoate were administered orally to 16 CD patients and 16 healthy
      controls on a low-benzoate diet. Baseline and peak urinary hippurate excretion
      were measured. RESULTS: Baseline hippurate levels were significantly lower in the
      CD patients (p = 0.0009). After benzoate ingestion, peak urinary levels of
      hippurate did not differ significantly between the cohorts. Consequently the
      relative increase in excretion was significantly greater in CD (p = 0.0007).
      CONCLUSIONS: Lower urinary hippurate levels in CD are not due to differences in
      dietary benzoate. A defect in the enzymatic conjugation of benzoate in CD has
      been excluded, strongly implicating altered gut microbial metabolism as the cause
      of decreased hippurate levels in CD.

TI  - Risk factors for metabolic bone disease in Crohn's disease patients.
PG  - 2117-24
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21297 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim was to evaluate the presence of metabolic bone disease (MBD) 
      in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and to identify potential etiologic
      factors. METHODS: The case-control study included 99 patients with CD and 56
      controls with a similar age and gender distribution. Both groups had dual-energy 
      x-ray absorptionmetry and a nutritional evaluation. Single nucleotide
      polymorphisms at the IL1, TNF-alpha, LTalpha, and IL-6 genes were analyzed in
      patients only. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software. RESULTS:
      The prevalence of MBD was significantly higher in patients (P = 0.006). CD
      patients with osteoporosis were older (P < 0.005), small bowel involvement and
      surgical resections were more frequent (P < 0.005), they more often exhibited a
      penetrating or stricturing phenotype (P < 0.05), duration of disease over 15
      years (P < 0.005), and body mass index (BMI) under 18.5 kg/m(2) (P < 0.01) were
      more often found. No association was found with steroid use. Patients with a
      Z-score < -2.0 more frequently had chronic active disease (P < 0.05). With regard
      to diet, low vitamin K intake was more frequent (P = 0.03) and intake of total,
      monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fat was higher in patients with Z-score <
      -2.0 (P < 0.05). With respect to genetics, carriage of the polymorphic allele for
      LTalpha252 A/G was associated with a higher risk of osteoporosis (P = 0.02).
      Regression analysis showed that age over 40 years, chronic active disease, and
      previous colonic resections were independently associated with the risk of
      developing MBD. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of MBD was significantly higher in CD
      patients. Besides the usual risk factors, we observed that factors related to
      chronic active and long-lasting disease increased the risk of MBD.

TI  - Translocation of Crohn's disease Escherichia coli across M-cells: contrasting
      effects of soluble plant fibres and emulsifiers.
PG  - 1331-9
LID - 10.1136/gut.2009.195370 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is common in developed nations where the typical diet
      is low in fibre and high in processed food. Primary lesions overlie Peyer's
      patches and colonic lymphoid follicles where bacterial invasion through M-cells
      occurs. We have assessed the effect of soluble non-starch polysaccharide (NSP)
      and food emulsifiers on translocation of Escherichia coli across M-cells.
      METHODS: To assess effects of soluble plant fibres and food emulsifiers on
      translocation of mucosa-associated E coli isolates from Crohn's disease patients 
      and from non-Crohn's controls, we used M-cell monolayers, generated by co-culture
      of Caco2-cl1 and Raji B cells, and human Peyer's patches mounted in Ussing
      chambers. RESULTS: E coli translocation increased across M-cells compared to
      parent Caco2-cl1 monocultures; 15.8-fold (IQR 6.2-32.0) for Crohn's disease E
      coli (N=8) and 6.7-fold (IQR 3.7-21.0) for control isolates (N=5). Electron
      microscopy confirmed E coli within M-cells. Plantain and broccoli NSP markedly
      reduced E coli translocation across M-cells at 5 mg/ml (range 45.3-82.6%
      inhibition, p<0.01); apple and leek NSP had no significant effect.
      Polysorbate-80, 0.01% vol/vol, increased E coli translocation through Caco2-cl1
      monolayers 59-fold (p<0.05) and, at higher concentrations, increased
      translocation across M-cells. Similarly, E coli translocation across human
      Peyer's patches was reduced 45+/-7% by soluble plantain NSP (5 mg/ml) and
      increased 2-fold by polysorbate-80 (0.1% vol/vol). CONCLUSIONS: Translocation of 
      E coli across M-cells is reduced by soluble plant fibres, particularly plantain
      and broccoli, but increased by the emulsifier Polysorbate-80. These effects occur
      at relevant concentrations and may contribute to the impact of dietary factors on
      Crohn's disease pathogenesis.

TI  - Body composition in childhood inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 112-5
LID - 10.1016/j.clnu.2010.07.014 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is known about the impact of disease and treatment on
      the pattern of growth in children with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).
      Significant deficits in height and weight in children with Crohn's disease have
      been reported but changes in fat and fat free mass are less well defined. This
      study aims to describe the height, weight and body composition of a cohort of
      children with IBD. METHODS: Height, weight, skinfold thicknesses and
      bioelectrical impedance analysis was performed. Disease activity was assessed
      with clinical scoring systems. RESULTS: 55 children, median age 13.7 years (range
      6.5-17.7) were studied. Median (25th, 75th percentile) Standard Deviation Score
      for BMI, Height and Weight were - 0.3 (- 0.97, 0.65), - 0.56 (- 1.42, 0.06), -
      0.62 (- 1.43, 0.19). In Crohn's disease, using multiple regression analysis
      disease activity measured by PCDAI was significantly inversely related to fat
      free mass (beta - 0.2, 95% CI -0.17, -0.03, p 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Children with 
      IBD were both under and overweight. Nutritional deficits were more common in
      Crohn's disease. Fat free mass was related to disease activity in children with
      Crohn's disease regardless of changes in weight. Weight or BMI may mask deficits 
      in lean tissue in the presence of normal or increased proportions of body fat.

      Reaction (PCR) and Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) techniques
      were used to analyze Caspase9+93C/T, FasLigand-843C/T, Peroxisome
      Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma+161C/T and Peroxisome
      Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma Pro12Ala SNPs in 99 patients with CD and
      116 healthy controls. Interactions between SNPs and fat intake in modulating
      disease activity were analyzed using regression analysis. RESULTS: None of the
      polymorphisms analyzed influenced disease susceptibility and/or activity, but a
      high intake of total, saturated and monounsaturated fats and a higher ratio of
      n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids(PUFA), was associated with a more active
      phenotype (p < 0.05). We observed that the detrimental effect of a high intake of
      total and trans fat was more marked in wild type carriers of the Caspase9+93C/T
      polymorphism [O.R(95%CI) 4.64(1.27-16.89) and O.R(95%CI) 4.84(1.34-17.50)]. In
      the Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma Pro12Ala SNP, we also
      observed that a high intake of saturated and monounsaturated fat was associated
      to a more active disease in wild type carriers [OR(95%CI) 4.21(1.33-13.26) and
      4.37(1.52-12.51)]. Finally, a high intake of n-6 PUFA was associated with a more 
      active disease in wild type carriers for the FasLigand-843C/T polymorphism
      [O.R(95%CI) 5.15(1.07-24.74)]. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first
      study to disclose a synergism between fat intake and SNPs in apoptotic genes in
      modulating disease activity in CD patients.

AB  - AIM: Exclusion diets have been shown to prolong remission in Crohn's disease
      (CD). We assessed IgG4-targeted exclusion diets in patients with CD. METHOD:
      Forty patients with symptomatic CD were recruited. Their sera were tested for
      IgG4 antibodies to 14 specific food antigens and each subject's four most
      reactive foods were excluded for 4 weeks. Disease activity was assessed using a
      modified CD activity index (mCDAI). Questionnaire and inflammatory markers were
      measured before and on completion of the exclusion diet. RESULTS: Eleven patients
      did not complete the study, leaving 29 for analysis. Of these, 26 (90%) reported 
      symptomatic improvement with a reduction in mCDAI from a mean of 171-97.5 (P =
      0.0001). The ESR fell from 23 to 17 mm/h (P = 0.021) and the IgG4 titres for the 
      excluded foods fell from a mean of 3015-2306 mcgA/l (P = 0.003). CONCLUSION:
      IgG4-guided exclusion diets resulted in significant symptomatic improvement with 
      an objective fall in an inflammatory marker. This approach may be useful in
      clinical practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease
      with relapse and remission. CD patients are admitted to hospital when bowel
      inflammation flares up severely, which lowers their quality of life. Enteral
      nutrition (EN) with an elemental diet plays an important role in the treatment
      for CD patients in Japan, because of its few adverse effects, and it is thought
      to be effective in maintaining remission. We investigated the effectiveness of EN
      with an elemental diet with regard to the avoidance of hospitalization. METHODS: 
      A total of 268 patients with CD who visited hospital from 2003-2008 were
      enrolled. The relationship between the caloric content of an elemental diet and
      hospitalization as an end-point was examined retrospectively using Cox regression
      analysis. Cumulative non-hospitalization rates were calculated by the
      Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Of the 268 patients, 155 received an elemental diet
      providing 900 kcal/day or more. Among 237 patients with ileal involvement, 135
      patients receiving an elemental diet providing 900 kcal/day or more showed a
      statistically significant improvement in cumulative non-hospitalization rate.
      Among 31 patients without ileal involvement, in contrast, the cumulative
      non-hospitalization rate did not differ among those receiving an elemental diet
      of less or more than 900 kcal/day. CONCLUSION: The use of an elemental diet of
      900 kcal/day may be effective in avoiding hospitalization in CD patients with
      ileal lesions. This diet may be useful in improving the long-term convalescence
      of these patients.

AB  - The field of nutrigenomics recognizes gene-diet interactions, with regard to both
      the impact of genetic variation on nutrient requirements, and conversely nutrient
      regulation of the expression of genes. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are
      inflammatory bowel diseases for which twin studies reveal genetic susceptibility 
      that is impacted by diet and environment. Apparently contradictory data on the
      role of diet in inflammatory bowel disease would be entirely explainable if
      genetic variability determined dietary requirements and intolerances. Considering
      Crohn's disease, we recognize three major classes of genes. The first of these
      involves bacterial recognition through pattern recognition receptors and
      autophagy genes, while the second act through secondary immune response, and the 
      third concern epithelial barrier integrity. Despite genetic overlap with CD, the 
      first two groups of genes appear to be less important in ulcerative colitis,
      while other genes, particularly those involved in barrier function, gain
      prominence. Case-control studies suggest that these different genetic groups
      reflect distinct dietary requirements. Such studies suggest nutrigenomic
      approaches to maintaining disease remission at present, and preventing disease
      development in the future.

TI  - Lifestyle-related disease in Crohn's disease: relapse prevention by a
      semi-vegetarian diet.
PG  - 2484-95
AB  - AIM: To investigate whether semi-vegetarian diet (SVD) has a preventive effect
      against relapse of Crohn's disease (CD) in patients who have achieved remission, 
      who are a high-risk group for relapse. METHODS: A prospective, single center,
      2-year clinical trial was conducted. Twenty-two adult CD patients who achieved
      clinical remission either medically (n = 17) or surgically (n = 5) and consumed
      an SVD during hospitalization were advised to continue with an SVD and avoid
      known high-risk foods for inflammatory bowel disease. The primary endpoint was
      clinical relapse defined as the appearance of active symptoms of CD. Kaplan-Meier
      survival analysis was used to calculate the cumulative proportion of patients who
      had a relapse. A 2-year analysis of relapse rates of patients who followed an SVD
      and those who did not (an omnivorous diet group) was undertaken. RESULTS: SVD was
      continued by 16 patients (compliance 73%). Remission was maintained in 15 of 16
      patients (94%) in the SVD group vs two of six (33%) in the omnivorous group.
      Remission rate with SVD was 100% at 1 year and 92% at 2 years. SVD showed
      significant prevention in the time to relapse compared to that in the omnivorous 
      group (P = 0.0003, log rank test). The concentration of C-reactive protein was
      normal at the final visit in more than half of the patients in remission who were
      taking an SVD, who maintained remission during the study (9/15; 60%), who
      terminated follow-up (8/12; 67%), and who completed 2 years follow-up (7/10;
      70%). There was no untoward effect of SVD. CONCLUSION: SVD was highly effective
      in preventing relapse in CD.

TI  - Mechanisms of gastric emptying disturbances in chronic and acute inflammation of 
      the distal gastrointestinal tract.
PG  - G861-8
AB  - It is unclear why patients with inflammation of the distal bowel complain of
      symptoms referable to the upper gastrointestinal tract, specifically to gastric
      emptying (GE) disturbances. Thus we aimed to determine occurrence and putative
      pathomechanisms of gastric motor disorders in such patients. Thirteen healthy
      subjects (CON), 13 patients with Crohn's disease (CD), 10 with ulcerative colitis
      (UC), and 7 with diverticulitis (DIV) underwent a standardized (13)C-octanoic
      acid gastric emptying breath test. Plasma glucose, CCK, peptide YY, and
      glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) were measured periodically and correlated with GE
      parameters. Results were given in means +/- SD. Compared with CON, GE half time
      (T) was prolonged by 50% in CD (115 +/- 55 vs. 182 +/- 95 min, P = 0.037). Six
      CD, 2 DIV, and 2 UC patients had pathological T (>200 min). Postprandial plasma
      glucose was increased in all patients but was highest in DIV and correlated with 
      T (r = 0.90, P = 0.006). In CD, mean postprandial CCK levels were increased
      threefold compared with CON (6.5 +/- 6.7 vs. 2.1 +/- 0.6 pmol/l, P = 0.027) and
      were correlated with T (r = 0.60, P = 0.041). Compared with CON, GLP-1 levels
      were increased in UC (25.1 +/- 5.2 vs. 33.5 +/- 13.0 pmol/l, P = 0.046) but
      markedly decreased in DIV (9.6 +/- 5.2 pmol/l, P < 0.0001). We concluded that a
      subset of patients with CD, UC, or DIV has delayed GE. GE disturbances are most
      pronounced in CD and might partly be caused by excessive CCK release. In DIV
      there might be a pathophysiological link between decreased GLP-1 release,
      postprandial hyperglycemia, and delayed GE. These explorative data encourage
      further studies in larger patient groups.

AB  - Recent advances in molecular techniques have now made it possible to interrogate 
      the human microbiome in depth to better understand the interactions with the host
      organism and its role in diseases. We now report the utility of Length
      Heterogeneity Polymerase Chain Reaction (LH-PCR) to survey samples and a
      proprietary Multitagged Pyrosequencing (MTPS) methodology to interrogate the gut 
      microbiome in healthy and disease states. We present an overview of our studies
      demonstrating the application of these molecular-biology techniques to an example
      disease state such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). The findings show that
      there is a core mucosal bacterial microbiome (i.e., a mucosal biofilm) that is
      distinct from the luminal microbiome in health, and that the mucosal microbiome
      appears to be dysbiotic in IBD. We propose that the mucosal microbiome forms a
      synergistic and stable interaction with the host immune system, while the lumen
      microbiome varies based on diet or other environmental factors. We define this
      composite ecosystem of the human microbiome and human host as the Human
      Metabiome.

TI  - Does evidence exist to include dietary therapy in the treatment of Crohn's
      disease?
PG  - 191-215
LID - 10.1586/egh.10.11 [doi]
AB  - Prescription drugs and surgery are two common medical therapies for Crohn's
      disease (CD), an inflammatory bowel disease that affects the GI tract.
      Unfortunately, certain drugs can cause serious side effects, and surgeries must
      often be repeated. No diet has been established to alleviate the pain and
      suffering of CD patients. This is curious given the fact that a higher prevalence
      of food sensitivities exist in this population of patients, and enteral nutrition
      is not only the first-line of therapy in Japan, but a known research method used 
      to place the majority of CD patients into remission. Although not all patients
      respond equally to diet, many simply remove symptom-provoking foods, such as
      dairy, wheat, corn and certain fruits and vegetables. We suggest assisting these 
      patients in their self-assessment of irritating and symptom-provoking foods by
      educating them in the use of a food-symptom diary followed by a customized
      elimination diet trialed for 2-4 weeks to determine if there is any benefit to
      the individual patient.

TI  - Vitamin D-mediated calcium absorption in patients with clinically stable Crohn's 
      disease: a pilot study.
PG  - 1085-91
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.200900351 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin D is the critical hormone for intestinal absorption of calcium. Optimal
      calcium absorption is important for proper mineralization of bone in the
      prevention of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures, among other important
      functions. Diseases associated with gut inflammation, such as Crohn's disease
      (CD), may impair calcium absorption. This pilot study evaluated vitamin D-
      dependent calcium absorption in subjects with CD. Male subjects with CD (n=4) and
      healthy age-matched controls (n=5) were studied. All subjects had fractional
      calcium absorption (FCA; by the dual calcium isotope method), serum
      25-hydroxyvitamin D, serum calcium and 24 h urinary calcium excretion
      measurements at baseline. The FCA in response to vitamin D therapy was
      re-assessed following administration of oral calcitriol 0.25 mcg twice daily for 
      1 wk, followed by oral calcitriol 0.50 mcg twice daily for 1 wk. Serum calcium
      and 24 h urinary calcium determinations were re-assessed after each increasing
      dose of calcitriol as safety measures. There was no significant difference in
      calcium FCA at baseline or after increasing doses of calcitriol between the CD
      and controls. FCA in the control and CD group was approximately 35% at baseline, 
      which increased to 60% after calcitriol therapy. No subject developed
      hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria. Our results suggest that CD patients have a
      normal response to vitamin D in enhancing the efficacy of calcium absorption.
      This suggests that stable CD patients can follow calcium and vitamin D guidelines
      of non-CD adults. Other factors independent of vitamin D status may impair
      intestinal calcium absorption in CD, including the degree and location of
      inflammation, presence of surgical resection and/or use of glucocorticoids.

      disease.
PG  - 1696-707
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21251 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are considered important
      pharmaconutrients for modulating mucosal immunity and therapeutic responses in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We investigated the influence of 
      diet therapy involving the use of an "n-3 PUFA food exchange table" (n-3DP) on
      the fatty acid composition of the erythrocyte membranes of IBD patients and its
      remission-maintaining effects. METHODS: We analyzed the fatty acid composition of
      the erythrocyte membrane before and after n-3DP intervention in 20 initial-onset 
      IBD patients who had not undergone any dietary intervention. We then analyzed it 
      again and evaluated disease activity after 12-18 months intervention in 230 IBD
      patients (168 ulcerative colitis, 62 Crohn's disease; follow-up group) in whom
      n-3DP was introduced after remission had been achieved. The follow-up group was
      divided into remission and relapse groups. RESULTS: In the 20 initial-onset
      patients, the mean n-3/n-6 ratio significantly increased after intervention (0.41
      +/- 0.16 versus 0.70 +/- 0.20; P < 0.001). In the follow-up group the ratio in
      the remission group (n = 145) was significantly higher than that in the relapse
      group (n = 85) (0.65 +/- 0.28 versus 0.53 +/- 0.18; P < 0.001). The ratio
      significantly decreased in those who suffered a relapse after the beginning of
      treatment (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: N-3DP significantly increased the erythrocyte 
      membrane n-3/n-6 ratio in IBD patients, and this ratio was significantly higher
      in the remission group, suggesting that n-3DP alters the fatty acid composition
      of the cell membrane and influences clinical activity in IBD patients.

TI  - Scheduled maintenance therapy with infliximab improves the prognosis of Crohn's
      disease: a single center prospective cohort study in Japan.
PG  - 207-15
AB  - The main goal of Crohn's disease (CD) treatment at present is to induce and
      maintain remission for as long as possible, and several approaches have been used
      as induction and maintenance therapies. There are no reports that have compared
      the effects on mid- and long-term prognosis among the induction and maintenance
      therapies, especially between infliximab, a chimeric antibody to tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha, and nutritional therapies. A total of 262 CD patients with induced 
      remission were enrolled in the cohort study. Patients who failed to achieve
      remission, and patients who were lost to follow-up within 12 months were
      excluded. Induction therapies for CD included total elemental enteral nutrition, 
      total parenteral nutrition, infliximab, prednisolone, and surgical resection.
      Maintenance therapies included home elemental diet, 5-aminosalicylates,
      immunomodulators, and scheduled infliximab therapy. We evaluated the possible
      predictive factors of relapse and surgical recurrence including the clinical
      backgrounds of the patients and medical therapies, using the Cox multivariate
      hazard analysis. The main factors that strongly affected the first relapse were
      scheduled infliximab therapy (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.24, p < 0.0001), surgical
      induction (HR = 0.19, p < 0.0001) and high frequency of previous relapse (HR =
      2.56, p = 0.002). Penetrating (HR = 3.33, p = 0.009) and stricturing (HR = 6.60, 
      p < 0.0001) disease behavior were main risk factors of surgical recurrence.
      Scheduled infliximab therapy is the most effective maintenance therapy in a real 
      clinical setting with respect to the mid- and long-term prognosis.

TI  - Effect of exclusion diet with nutraceutical therapy in juvenile Crohn's disease.
PG  - 277-85
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most moderate-severe juvenile Crohn's disease (CD) patients are in a 
      constant catabolic state resulting in poor weight gain and growth failure.
      Anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and monoclonal antibody drugs, as well as
      growth hormone (GH), frequently fail to achieve sustained remission or reverse
      growth failure. OBJECTIVE: To test whether an exclusion diet with nutraceutical
      therapy (DNT) could induce sustained clinical remission and weight gain, and if
      so does this enhance the ability for GH to reverse growth failure. METHODS: An
      uncontrolled prospective case study was undertaken in six moderate- severe CD
      patients, two of whom had completed growth. All were treated with DNT. Adequate
      caloric and protein ( >or= 3g/kg/d) intake for catch up weight was prescribed.
      Dairy products, certain grains and carrageenan containing foods were eliminated. 
      Nutraceuticals, consisting of fish peptides, bovine colostrum, boswellia serrata,
      curcumin and a multivitamin were administered daily. Lactobacillus GG, a
      probiotic, was administered twice weekly. Recombinant human GH (rhGH) was
      administered daily. RESULTS: Within 2 months of starting DNT all six patients
      went into remission, with discontinuation of all pharmacological drugs. Three
      patients have remained in sustained remission for 4 to 8 years. One patient with 
      very severe CD had recurrence of CD symptoms after being in complete remission
      for 18 months, one patient was in remission for 3 years but symptoms recurred
      when she became less compliant to DNT and one recently treated patient remains in
      remission after 6 months. With the addition of rhGH, the 4 growing patients had
      good-excellent growth response CONCLUSION: DNT engendered prolonged remission and
      restoration of normal weight in moderate-severe juvenile CD patients, providing
      conditions that enabled rhGH to stimulate growth. These findings justify larger
      controlled trials to evaluate the long-term benefit of compliance to DNT in both 
      juvenile and adult CD patients.

TI  - Dietary factors in chronic inflammation: food tolerances and intolerances of a
      New Zealand Caucasian Crohn's disease population.

AB  - Diet is known to play a major role in the symptoms of the inflammatory bowel
      disease, Crohn's disease (CD). Although no single diet is appropriate to all
      individuals, most CD patients are aware of foods that provide adverse or
      beneficial effects. This study seeks to categorise foods in relation to their
      effects on symptoms of CD, in a New Zealand Caucasian population. Four hundred
      and forty-six subjects from two different centres in New Zealand were recruited
      into the study. An extensive dietary questionnaire (257 food items in 15 groups) 
      recorded self-reported dietary tolerances and intolerances. Across each of the
      food groups, there were statistically significant differences among responses to 
      foods. A two-dimensional graphical summary enabled stratification of foods
      according to the probability that they will be either beneficial or detrimental. 
      A small number of foods are frequently considered to be beneficial, including
      white fish, salmon and tuna, gluten-free products, oatmeal, bananas, boiled
      potatoes, sweet potatoes (kumara), pumpkin, soya milk, goat's milk and yoghurt.
      Foods that are typically considered detrimental include grapefruit, chilli or
      chilli sauce, corn and corn products, peanuts, cream, salami, curried foods, cola
      drinks, high energy drinks, beer, and red wine. For a number of the food items,
      the same item that was beneficial for one group of subjects was detrimental to
      others; in particular soya milk, goat's milk, yoghurt, oatmeal, kiwifruit,
      prunes, apple, broccoli, cauliflower, linseed, pumpkin seed, sunflower seed,
      ginger and ginger products, beef, lamb, liver, and oily fish. It was not possible
      to identify a specific group of food items that should be avoided by all CD
      patients. The wide range of detrimental items suggests that dietary maintenance
      of remission is likely to be difficult, and to exclude a substantial number of
      foods. Personalised diets may be especially important to these individuals.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Previous studies have suggested an increasing use of complementary
      and alternative medicine (CAM) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
      Furthermore, a significant number of IBD patients fail to comply with treatment. 
      The aim of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of non-adherence the use of
      CAM in Hungarian patients with IBD. METHODS: A total of 655 consecutive IBD
      patients (Crohn's disease [CD]: 344, age: 38.2 + or - 12.9 years; ulcerative
      colitis [UC]: 311, age: 44.9 + or - 15.3 years) were interviewed during the visit
      at specialists by self-administered questionnaire including demographic and
      disease-related data, as well as items analyzing the extent of non-adherence and 
      CAM use. Patients taking more then 80% of each prescribed medicine were
      classified as adherent. RESULTS: The overall rate of self reported non-adherence 
      (CD: 20.9%, UC: 20.6%) and CAM (CD: 31.7%, UC: 30.9%) use was not different
      between CD and UC. The most common causes of non-adherence were: forgetfulness
      (47.8%), too many/unnecessary pills (39.7%), being afraid of side effects (27.9%)
      and too frequent dosing. Most common forms of CAM were herbal tee (47.3%),
      homeopathy (14.6%), special diet (12.2%), and acupuncture (5.8%). In CD, disease 
      duration, date of last follow-up visit, educational level and previous surgeries 
      were predicting factors for non-adherence. Alternative medicine use was
      associated in both diseases with younger age, higher educational level and
      immunosuppressant use. In addition, CAM use in UC was more common in females and 
      in patients with supportive psychiatric/psychological therapy. CONCLUSIONS:
      Non-adherence and CAM use is common in patients with IBD. Special attention
      should be paid to explore the identified predictive factors during follow-up
      visits to improve adherence to therapy and improving patient-doctor relationship.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Environmental factors are thought to play an important role in the
      development of Crohn's disease (CD). Immune responses against auto-antigens or
      food antigens may be a reason for the perpetuation of inflammation. METHODS: In a
      pilot study, 79 CD patients and 20 healthy controls were examined for food
      immunoglobulin G (IgG). Thereafter, the clinical relevance of these food IgG
      antibodies was assessed in a double-blind cross-over study with 40 patients.
      Based on the IgG antibodies, a nutritional intervention was planned. The
      interferon (IFN)gamma secretion of T cells was measured. Eosinophil-derived
      neurotoxin was quantified in stool. RESULTS: The pilot study resulted in a
      significant difference of IgG antibodies in serum between CD patients and healthy
      controls. In 84 and 83% of the patients, respectively, IgG antibodies against
      processed cheese and yeast were detected. The daily stool frequency significantly
      decreased by 11% during a specific diet compared with a sham diet. Abdominal pain
      reduced and general well-being improved. IFNgamma secretion of T cells increased.
      No difference for eosinophil-derived neurotoxin in stool was detected.
      CONCLUSION: A nutritional intervention based on circulating IgG antibodies
      against food antigens showed effects with respect to stool frequency. The
      mechanisms by which IgG antibodies might contribute to disease activity remain to
      be elucidated.

AB  - 75% of hospital patients with Crohn's disease (CD) suffer from malnutrition and
      one third of CD patients have a body mass index below 20. Inflammatory bowel
      diseases (IBD) patients have many vitamin and nutrient deficiencies which can
      lead to important consequences such as hyperhomocysteinemia which is associated
      with a higher risk of thromboembolic disease. Nutritional deficiencies in IBD
      patients are the result of insufficient intake, malabsorption and protein-losing 
      enteropathy as well as the metabolic distubances directly induced by the chronic 
      disease and its treatments, in particular corticosteroids. Screening for
      nutritional deficiencies in chronic disease patients is warranted. Managing the
      deficiencies involves simple nutritional guidelines, vitamin supplements, and
      nutritional support in the worst cases, in particular in children in order to
      limit the impact of IBD on growth. In active CD, enteral nutrition is the first
      line therapy in children and should be used as sole therapy in adults mainly when
      treatment with corticosteroids is not feasible.

AB  - Rapid increase in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) incidence in
      developed countries, occurrence of CD in spouses and lack of complete concordance
      in monozygotic twins are strong arguments for the role of environmental factors
      in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Only two environmental factors have an
      established role in IBD. Smoking is a risk factor for CD and a protective factor 
      for UC; appendectomy is a protective factor for UC. Many other environmental
      factors for IBD have been investigated. These are infectious agents, diet, drugs,
      stress and socio-economic factors. They are detailed in this paper. Among them,
      adherent invasive E. coli, infectious gastroenteritis, oral contraceptives and
      antibiotics could play a role in CD. To date, three theories integrate
      environmental factors to pathogenesis of IBD: hygiene, infection and cold chain. 
      Much work remains to be done to identify risk factors for IBD. As exemplified by 
      smoking, research of environmental risk factors of IBD is useful since it may
      lead to an improved disease course among patients and perhaps, to appropriate
      prevention among predisposed subjects. Further studies in this field are eagerly 
      awaited.

TI  - Fasting plasma carotenoids concentrations in Crohn's and pancreatic cancer
      patients compared to control subjects.
PG  - 87-94
LID - 10.1024/0300-9831.79.2.87 [doi]
AB  - Carotenoids are colored molecules that are widespread in the plant kingdom, but
      animals cannot synthesize them. Carotenes are long, apolar molecules which
      require fully functioning digestive processes to be absorbed properly. Hence they
      could be interesting markers of intestinal absorption and digestion. Indeed, only
      few tests are available to assess these processes and only the D-xylose tolerance
      test is routinely used. However D-xylose is a sugar that tests only the
      absorption of water-soluble compounds and it only tests duodenal absorption. In
      this study, we have evaluated carotenoids as markers of digestion and absorption.
      We compared fasting plasma carotenoids concentrations in 21 control subjects, 20 
      patients with Crohn's disease, and 18 patients with pancreatic cancer. Crohn's
      disease alters intestinal absorption while pancreatic cancer decreases pancreatic
      enzyme secretion thus impairing digestion. Results show that all carotenoids are 
      significantly lower in Crohn's and cancer patients as compared to control
      subjects and the multifactorial analysis shows that this decrease is mostly
      independent of dietary intake. Interestingly, maldigestion as seen in pancreatic 
      cancer more strongly influences plasma lutein and lycopene concentrations while
      malabsorption in Crohn's disease acts on other carotenoids. Thus carotenoids
      could be interesting alternatives for testing and following patients that are
      suspected of having malabsorption or maldigestion syndromes.

AB  - Humans have evolved with oral exposure to dietary microparticles and
      nanoparticles as a normal occurrence but the ever-growing exploitation of
      nanotechnology is likely to increase exposure further, both qualitatively and
      quantitatively. Moreover, unlike the situation with respirable particles,
      relatively little is known about gastrointestinal intake and handling of
      nanoparticles. With a long term interest in gut exposure and responses to dietary
      microparticles, our group is now applying its expertise to nanoparticles in the
      gastrointestinal tract. Here we aim to address (i) the current challenges
      associated with the characterisation of particle-host or particle-cell
      interactions, (ii) the origin and mechanisms of uptake of particles in the
      gastrointestinal tract, especially via the Peyer's patch and (iii) potential
      cellular effects of nanoparticles in the generation of reactive oxygen species
      and inflammasome activation, or microparticles in their adjuvant activity in
      pro-inflammatory signalling and immune responsiveness.

      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - S14-34

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the evidence base for the medical
      (pharmaceutical and nutritional) treatment of paediatric inflammatory bowel
      disease. METHODS: Key clinical questions were formulated regarding different
      treatment modalities used in the treatment of paediatric (not adult-onset) IBD,
      in particular the induction and maintenance of remission in Crohn disease and
      ulcerative colitis. Electronic searches were performed from January 1966 to
      December 2006, using the electronic search strategy of the Cochrane IBD group.
      Details of papers were entered on a dedicated database, reviewed in abstract
      form, and disseminated in full for appraisal. Clinical guidelines were appraised 
      using the AGREE instrument and all other relevant papers were appraised using
      Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network methodology, with evidence levels
      given to all papers. RESULTS: A total of 6285 papers were identified, of which
      1255 involved children; these were entered on the database. After critical
      appraisal, only 103 publications met our criteria as evidence on medical
      treatment of paediatric IBD. We identified 3 clinical guidelines, 1 systematic
      review, and 16 randomised controlled trials; all were of variable quality, with
      none getting the highest methodological scores. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first
      comprehensive review of the evidence base for the treatment of paediatric IBD,
      highlighting the paucity of trials of high methodological quality. As a result,
      the development of clinical guidelines for managing children and young people
      with IBD must be consensus based, informed by the best-available evidence from
      the paediatric literature and high-quality data from the adult IBD literature,
      together with the clinical expertise and multidisciplinary experience of
      paediatric IBD experts.

TI  - Combining nutrition, food science and engineering in developing solutions to
      Inflammatory bowel diseases--omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids as an example.
PG  - 60-72
LID - 10.1039/c0fo00057d [doi]
AB  - The Inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are
      debilitating conditions, characterised by lifelong sensitivity to certain foods, 
      and often a need for surgery and life-long medication. The anti-inflammatory
      effects of long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated acids justify their inclusion in
      enteral nutrition formulas that have been associated with disease remission.
      However, there have been variable data in clinical trials to test supplementary
      omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in inducing or maintaining remission in these
      diseases. Although variability in trial design has been suggested as a major
      factor, we suggest that variability in processing and presentation of the
      products may be equally or more important. The nature of the source, and rapidity
      of getting the fish or other food source to processing or to market, will affect 
      the percentage of the various fatty acids, possible presence of heavy metal
      contaminants and oxidation status of the various fatty acids. For dietary
      supplements or fortified foods, whether the product is encapsulated or not,
      whether storage is under nitrogen or not, and length of time between harvest,
      processing and marketing will again profoundly affect the properties of the final
      product. Clinical trials to test efficacy of these products in IBD to date have
      utilised the relevant skills of pharmacology and gastroenterology. We suggest
      that knowledge from food science, nutrition and engineering will be essential to 
      establish the true role of this important group of compounds in these diseases.

TI  - Laparoscopic surgery for recurrent ileocolic Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1382-6
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21186 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic (LAP) surgery is increasingly performed for primary
      ileocolic Crohn's disease (CD), but its application in patients with recurrent
      ileocolic CD is less well described. Our aim was to assess whether or not a
      laparoscopic approach was safe, feasible, and conferred meaningful short-term
      benefits in this patient population. METHODS: Patients undergoing LAP surgery for
      recurrent ileocolic CD at our institution from 1998-2008 were identified using a 
      prospectively maintained database. Potential risk factors for conversion to open 
      surgery and overall patient outcomes were assessed with univariate analysis.
      RESULTS: Forty patients were identified, of which 30 (75%) were LAP-completed and
      10 (25%) were LAP-converted. The groups did not differ with respect to
      clinicopathological features. LAP-converted patients were significantly more
      likely to require adhesiolysis than LAP-completed patients (100% versus 67%, P = 
      0.04). There was 1 intraoperative complication in a converted patient.
      LAP-converted patients had longer times to soft diet (4 versus 3 days, P = 0.03) 
      and longer length of stay (7 versus 4 days, P = 0.003). The groups did not differ
      with respect to incidence of postoperative complications or frequency of
      readmission within 30 days. There was no mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In up to 20% of 
      patients with recurrent ileocolic, successful laparoscopic re-resection may be
      prevented by adhesions. Conversion increased the length of stay without
      increasing morbidity. We conclude that LAP surgery can be safely performed in
      selected patients with recurrent ileocolic CD and leads to short-term benefits.

AB  - In the course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) a number of extraintestinal
      manifestations are known to occur, being the dermatological ones often associated
      to both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Pyoderma gangrenosum and erythema
      nodosum are the most frequent, but there are other skin manifestations less
      frequently reported such as leukocytoclastic vasculitis. We present a case, in
      which Crohn's disease and leukocytoclastic vasculitis were simultaneously
      diagnosed, and corticoids treatment achieved complete remission of the both
      cutaneous and gastrointestinal manifestations.

AB  - PURPOSE: Hitherto, the efficacy of enteral nutrition (EN) on clinical outcomes
      during biological maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease (CD) has not been
      investigated. This prospective study was to assess the efficacy of EN on the
      maintenance rate of clinical remission in patients with quiescent CD receiving
      infliximab as maintenance therapy. METHODS: Fifty-six patients who achieved
      clinical remission with infliximab induction therapy received infliximab as
      maintenance therapy (5 mg/kg, every 8 weeks). Thirty-two of the 56 patients
      received concomitant EN: elemental diet infusion during night-time and a low fat 
      diet during daytime (EN group), while the remaining 24 patients received neither 
      nutritional therapy nor food restriction (non-EN group). All patients were
      followed for 56 weeks; CD activity index (CDAI) was assessed and CDAI < 150 was
      defined as clinical remission. RESULTS: During the 56-week observation, the mean 
      CDAI was not significantly different between the 2 groups. Seven patients in the 
      EN group ceased EN therapy because they maintained complete remission. On an
      intention-to-treat basis, 25 patients in the EN group (78%) and 16 patients in
      the non-EN group (67%) remained in clinical remission during the 56-week
      observation (P = 0.51). CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes of this prospective study
      showed that concomitant EN during infliximab maintenance therapy does not
      significantly increase the maintenance rate of clinical remission in patients
      with CD.

TI  - Relationship between nutritional therapy and surgery in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1044-8
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Crohn's disease is often refractory and some patients require
      repeated surgical treatment. Nutritional therapy with an elemental diet has been 
      reported effective in improving nutritional state and suppressing inflammation,
      and might be expected to assist in minimizing the need for surgery. We evaluated 
      the relationship between an elemental diet and the period that patients spent
      without intestinal resection. METHODOLOGY: A total of 153 patients with Crohn's
      disease who visited our hospital from July, 1999 to July, 2005 were enrolled. The
      relationship between the caloric content of an elemental diet and surgery as an
      endpoint was examined using Cox regression analysis. Cumulative non-operation
      rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical significance was
      determined using the log-rank test. RESULTS: Among patients with jejunoileal
      involvement, patients receiving an elemental diet providing 900 kcal or more per 
      day showed a statistically significant improvement in cumulative non-operation
      rate. Among those without jejunoileal involvement, in contrast, the cumulative
      non-operation rate did not differ among those receiving an elemental diet of less
      or more than 900 kcal per day. CONCLUSIONS: The use of an elemental diet of 900
      kcal per day may be effective in avoiding surgery in patients with jejunoileal
      lesions. This diet may be useful in improving long-term convalescence in these
      patients.

TI  - [Epidemiology of inflammatory bowel disease: controversies in classical
      epidemiology].
PG  - 135-45
AB  - Incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have shown a
      dramatic increase in last decades. Diagnosis can be made at any age, no sex
      predominance is apparent, and while mortality rates are similar to in general
      population, higher rates of colorec-tal cancer are evident in most studies,
      probably as a consequence of long-term chronic inflammation. Probably, IBD are
      polygenic diseases sharing genes of sus-ceptibility for both of them (Ulcerative 
      colitis and Crohn disease), but with other specific different genes for each one.
      Among environmental risk factors described, smoking is the most important, with
      different behaviour in both diseases, though there have been described other
      associated risk factors like appendectomy, oral contraceptives, infections, diet,
      childhood hygiene, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory intake.

TI  - Mushroom intolerance: a novel diet-gene interaction in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 506-8
LID - 10.1017/S0007114509276446 [doi]
AB  - Carrying a functional single nucleotide polymorphism (L503F, c. 1672 C>T) in the 
      gene for the Na-dependent organic cation transporter (OCTN1), increases the risk 
      of Crohn's disease (CD) in some, but not all, populations. Case-control data on
      New Zealand Caucasians show no differences for CD risk between individuals
      carrying the L503F OCTN1 C-allele when compared with those carrying the variant
      T-allele. However, more of the New Zealand CD cases report intolerance to maize
      and mushrooms than those who report beneficial effects or no differences. The
      OCTN1 gene encodes a transporter for ergothionine, a fungal metabolite at high
      levels in mushrooms but not widely common in other dietary items. An inability to
      tolerate mushrooms showed statistically significant associations with the variant
      OCTN1 genotype. That is, among those individuals reporting adverse effects from
      mushrooms, there was a higher frequency of the variant T-allele when compared
      with the general population, or with CD patients overall. We believe that this is
      a novel gene-diet association, suggesting that individuals carrying the OCTN1
      variant single nucleotide polymorphism may have an enhanced risk of adverse
      symptoms associated with consuming mushrooms. Nutrigenomic approaches to dietary 
      recommendations may be appropriate in this group.

PG  - 885-91
LID - 10.1016/j.nut.2009.06.011 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consists of two main disorders, ulcerative
      colitis and Crohn's disease, that cause chronic, recurrent inflammation of the
      intestine. An inappropriate immune response to the enteric ecosystem has been
      postulated to cause IBD. Genomewide association studies provide the information
      of diverse genetic variations and susceptibilities to patients with IBD. Through 
      the application of these studies, the pathogenesis of IBD may result in part from
      genetic abnormalities that regulate epithelial barrier function and innate and
      adaptive immune responses. Crohn's disease shows strong association with CARD15, 
      ATG15L1, and IRGM, which are involved in the innate immunity. In the adaptive
      immune response, IL23R, MST1, IL12B, and STAT3 polymorphisms are associated with 
      Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Current pharmacologic treatment of IBD,
      including 5-aminosalycylate, steroids, and immunomodulator therapy, are mainly
      aimed at suppressing inflammation non-specifically, except biologic therapies
      such as anti-tumor necrosis factor molecule, which block specific proinflammatory
      molecules. For nutritional issues in IBD, the mainstay of therapy has been
      supportive, with particular attention paid to the prevention, recognition, and
      therapy of nutritional deficiencies, and individual outcomes to specific dietary 
      factors have been controversial. Parenteral nutritional support and exclusionary 
      diets have been investigated and are not the subject of this review. The emerging
      concepts of nutrition-gene interaction gave birth to unique scientific fields,
      nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics. These studies provide information about 1) the
      genetic variability that induces an individual's response to nutrition according 
      to particular states of health and disease and 2) changes in gene expression that
      develop as a result of nutrition-gene interaction. For IBD, the role of diet in
      the regulation of the immune response against gut flora is the subject of current
      intensive evaluation. These approaches may lead clinicians to derive a
      personalized nutritional prescription based on individual genetic variations and 
      may result in a significant impact on IBD treatment.

TI  - Coping strategy when patients with quiescent Crohn's disease recognize that their
      conditions are worsening.
PG  - 1109-12
LID - 10.1007/s00535-009-0104-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although self-management is important for Crohn's disease (CD), there
      is no research focusing on self-management, especially in worsening conditions.
      The purpose of this study was to investigate how quiescent CD patients cope with 
      their conditions worsening. METHODS: A questionnaire containing six types of
      coping strategy for worsening conditions was created based on a semi-structured
      interview. Seventy-six quiescent CD patients participated in this study. We also 
      analyzed the related factors of each coping strategy for worsening conditions.
      RESULTS: The total percentage of subjects who adopt the strategy of "change
      contents of meals" 'always' or 'often' was approximately 70%. On the other hand, 
      the strategy of "see a doctor immediately" was approximately 20% in total of
      'always' or 'often'. When 'sometimes' was added, "take extra medicine" was
      approximately 42%. The subjects with experience of hospitalization within 3 years
      (Z = -2.352, P = 0.019), presence of supplemental elemental diet (Z = -5.182, P <
      0.001), or 1 year or less interval since last relapse (Z = -3.352, P = 0.001)
      showed a significant tendency to adopt the coping strategy of "take (add to)
      elemental diet." CONCLUSION: The major coping strategy was "change contents of
      meals," and the minor coping strategy was "see a doctor immediately." The
      subjects with unstable disease state adopted the coping strategy of "take (add
      to) elemental diet." The coping strategies for worsening conditions vary
      according to patients' backgrounds. The coping type should be taken into account 
      when treating CD patients.

LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181919695 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Variation in medical care can be a barrier to improving clinical
      outcomes. We aim to describe the variation in care of Crohn disease as provided
      by a broad sample of pediatric gastroenterologists. METHODS: Two hundred
      forty-six Crohn disease patients of 93 pediatric gastroenterologists from 48
      practice sites starting treatment with either thiopurine or infliximab were
      studied. We assessed variation in diagnostic testing that had been performed to
      establish the diagnosis of Crohn disease and to assess the phenotype, extent, and
      severity of disease. We also assessed variation in initial thiopurine and
      infliximab dosage and in nutritional therapy. RESULTS: Diagnostic studies in
      which care was uniform included complete blood count, performed in 100% of
      patients, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and colonoscopy in 96%, and upper
      endoscopy in 89%. However, imaging of the small bowel had not been performed in
      19%, and a stool test for pathogens had not been performed in 29%. Thiopurine
      methyltransferase (TPMT) had been measured in 61% of patients before treatment
      with a thiopurine; in 85%, TPMT was normal. Nonetheless, even when TPMT was
      normal, 40% of patients received an initial dose of thiopurine that was lower
      than recommended. Testing for tuberculosis before initiating treatment with
      infliximab was not performed in 30%. In addition, 36% of severely underweight
      patients were not receiving a multivitamin supplement, supplemental formula, or
      tube feeding. CONCLUSIONS: There is variation in diagnostic and therapeutic
      interventions in the management of pediatric Crohn disease, and gaps exist
      between recommended and actual care.

TI  - Enteral nutrition improves health-related quality of life in Crohn's disease
      patients with long disease duration.
PG  - 321-7
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Although enteral nutrition therapy has been highlighted as
      maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease, few reports have investigated the impact
      of enteral nutrition on the health-related quality of life of Crohn's disease
      patients. METHODOLOGY: We cross-sectionally evaluated the effect of multiple
      clinical factors including enteral nutrition on the health-related quality of
      life of Crohn's disease patients focusing on patient disease duration using the
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire. RESULTS: Of all 126 patients examined, 
      95 patients were receiving enteral nutrition. Multiple linear regression analysis
      using 18 clinical parameters revealed that disease activity was a dominant factor
      that affected the health-related quality of life of Crohn's disease patients, and
      that enteral nutrition was also an independent factor that improved the
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire total score, bowel symptoms, and
      systemic symptoms for patients with a disease duration of 10 years or more (P =
      0.0090, 0.0033, and 0.016, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Enteral nutrition improved
      the health-related quality of life of Crohn's disease patients with long-term
      disease duration. Thus, enteral nutrition should be recommended as one of the
      options for maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease.

TI  - Potential for amino acids supplementation during inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 518-24
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21017 [doi]
AB  - The pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) is multifactorial and
      involves interactions of gut luminal content with mucosal barrier and especially 
      immune cells. Malnutrition is a frequent issue during IBD flares, especially in
      Crohn's disease (CD) patients, and nutritional support is frequently used to
      treat malnutrition but also in an attempt to modulate intestinal inflammation.
      The use of oral or enteral nutrition intervention in IBDs may be effective, alone
      or in combination with drugs, to achieve and maintain remission. However,
      standard diets are less effective than new-generation biotherapies and could be
      improved by supplementation with specific immunomodulatory amino acids.
      Experimental studies evaluating glutamine, the preferential substrate for
      enterocytes, are promising. Some clinical studies with oral glutamine in CD are
      until now disappointing, but new formulations and targeting could enhance
      glutamine efficacy at the site of mucosal lesions. The role of arginine, involved
      in nitric oxide and polyamines synthesis, still remains debated. However, the
      effects of these amino acids in IBD have been poorly documented in humans. Other 
      candidates like glycine, cysteine, histidine, or taurine should also be evaluated
      in the future.

TI  - Characterization of inflammatory bowel disease with urinary metabolic profiling.
PG  - 1435-44
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2009.175 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Distinguishing between the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's 
      disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC) is important for both management and
      prognostic reasons. Discrimination using noninvasive techniques could be an
      adjunct to conventional diagnostics. Differences have been shown between the
      intestinal microbiota of CD and UC patients and controls; the gut bacteria
      influence specific urinary metabolites that are quantifiable using proton
      high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. This study tested 
      the hypothesis that such metabolites differ between IBD and control cohorts, and 
      that using multivariate pattern-recognition analysis, the cohorts could be
      distinguished by urine NMR spectroscopy. METHODS: NMR spectra were acquired from 
      urine samples of 206 Caucasian subjects (86 CD patients, 60 UC patients, and 60
      healthy controls). Longitudinal samples were collected from 75 individuals. NMR
      resonances specific for metabolites influenced by the gut microbes were studied, 
      including hippurate, formate, and 4-cresol sulfate. Multivariate analysis of all 
      urinary metabolites involved principal components analysis (PCA) and partial
      least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). RESULTS: Hippurate levels were
      lowest in CD patients and differed significantly between the three cohorts
      (P<0.0001). Formate levels were higher and 4-cresol sulfate levels lower in CD
      patients than in UC patients or controls (P=0.0005 and P=0.0002, respectively).
      PCA revealed clustering of the groups; PLS-DA modeling was able to distinguish
      the cohorts. These results were independent of medication and diet and were
      reproducible in the longitudinal cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Specific urinary
      metabolites related to gut microbial metabolism differ between CD patients, UC
      patients, and controls. The emerging technique of urinary metabolic profiling
      with multivariate analysis was able to distinguish these cohorts.

TI  - Pediatric Crohn's disease activity at diagnosis, its influence on pediatrician's 
      prescribing behavior, and clinical outcome 5 years later.
PG  - 1670-7
LID - 10.1002/ibd.20950 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: No studies have been performed in which therapeutic regimens have
      been compared between mild and moderate-to-severe pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) 
      at diagnosis. The aim was to analyze pediatric CD activity at diagnosis, its
      influence on pediatrician's prescribing behavior, and clinical outcome 5 years
      later. METHODS: In a retrospective multicenter study we divided pediatric CD
      patients at diagnosis into mild or moderate-severe disease. We compared initial
      therapies, duration of first remission, number of exacerbations, height-for-age
      and weight-for-height evolvement, and cumulative duration of systemic steroid use
      in a 5-year follow-up period. RESULTS: Forty-three children were included (25
      with mild and 18 with moderate-severe disease). Aminosalicylate monotherapy was
      more frequently prescribed in the mild group (40% versus 17%; P < 0.01). The
      median duration of systemic steroid use was 18.3 months in the mild group and
      10.4 months in the moderate-severe group (P = 0.09). Duration of first remission 
      was 15.0 months in the mild group and 23.4 months in the moderate-severe group (P
      = 0.16). The mean number of exacerbations was 2.2 in the mild group and 1.8 in
      the moderate-severe group (P = 0.28). CONCLUSIONS: CD patients with mild disease 
      were treated with aminosalicylate monotherapy more frequently. These patients,
      however, tend to have more exacerbations, shorter duration of first remission,
      and longer total duration of systemic steroid use. Our data support the concept
      that severity of disease at diagnosis does not reliably predict subsequent
      clinical course. This study suggests that there is no indication that children
      with mild CD should be treated differently compared to children with
      moderate-severe disease.

LID - 10.1017/S0007114509359085 [doi]
AB  - Approximately 25 % of individuals with Crohn's disease (CD), a life-long
      relapsing-remitting disease, are diagnosed during childhood and adolescence.
      Symptoms of CD, including abdominal pain, nausea and diarrhoea, can lead to
      reduced food intake, which may negatively have an impact on nutritional status
      during this critical period of growth and development. The aims of the present
      study were to assess the growth and adequacy of dietary intakes of children with 
      CD at Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick, and compare with healthy controls.
      Sixty-three subjects aged 10-16 years were recruited, including: children with
      active CD (n 18), children with CD in remission (n 23) and healthy controls (n
      22). Dietary intake was assessed using a FFQ and compared with current Australian
      recommended dietary intakes (RDI). Growth and dietary intakes were compared
      between groups. Subjects with active CD had lower weight and BMI Z scores than
      children in remission and controls. The energy intakes of children with active CD
      and those in remission were significantly lower than estimated energy
      requirements (P = 0.001 and P = 0.03 respectively). Children with active CD did
      not meet the RDI for Fe and their Ca intake was lower than the RDI (P = 0.04). In
      conclusion, the dietary intake of children with active CD was impaired, with
      inadequate intakes of energy, Ca and Fe. Reduced energy intakes during active
      disease may contribute to poor weight gain and impaired growth. Quantifying
      nutrient intake and ascertaining requirements for nutritional supplementation are
      essential components of successful management in paediatric CD.

AB  - Aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is complex and probably
      multifactorial. Nutrition has been proposed to be an important aetiological
      factor for development of IBD. Several components of the diet (such as sugar,
      fat, fibre, fruit and vegetable, protein, fast food, preservatives etc.) were
      examined as possible causative agents for IBD. According to some researchers
      infant feeding (breast feeding) may also contribute to the development of IBD.
      Though the importance of environmental factors is evidenced by the increasing
      incidence in developed countries and in migrant population in recent decades, the
      aetiology of IBD remained unclear. There are many theories, but as yet no dietary
      approaches have been proved to reduce the risk of developing IBD. The role of
      nutrition in the management of IBD is better understood. The prevention and
      correction of malnutrition, the provision of macro- and micronutrients and
      vitamins and the promotion of optimal growth and development of children are key 
      points of nutritional therapy. In active disease, the effective support of energy
      and nutrients is a very important part of the therapy. Natural and artificial
      nutrition or the combination of two can be chosen for supporting therapy of IBD. 
      The author summarises the aetiological and therapeutic role of nutrition in IBD.

      low-starch diet.
PG  - 843-9
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0b013e328318ecde [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease is suggested to result from a microbially triggered
      immune-mediated autoimmune process, involving mainly the terminal ileum and
      ileo-caecal junction. Klebsiella pneumoniae shares certain molecular structures
      present in pullulanase pulA and pulD secretion enzymes with various self-antigens
      present in collagens and HLA-B27 molecules, respectively. A link exists between
      high dietary starch intake and the growth of intestinal microflora, involving
      especially Klebsiella microbes. Increased exposure to Klebsiella in the gut as
      the result of high starch intake would lead to high production of antiKlebsiella 
      antibodies as well as autoantibodies to the cross-reactive self-antigens with the
      resultant inflammation at the pathological sites. Eradication of these microbes
      from the gut in patients with Crohn's disease with the use of low-starch diet and
      antibacterial agents as well as immunomodulatory measures could be beneficial in 
      the management of this disease.

      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 456-63
LID - 10.1007/s00774-009-0059-5 [doi]
AB  - Compromised skeletal status is a frequent finding in patients with Crohn's
      disease (CD), leading to increased fracture risk. Low body weight is associated
      with bone mineral density (BMD) in CD, although the relative importance of its
      components, lean and fat mass, is unclear. Muscle strength is also a predictor of
      BMD in nondiseased populations; however, its association with bone in CD is
      unknown. We examined the independent effects of body composition and muscle
      strength on regional and whole-body BMD in a cohort of CD patients. Sixty men and
      women, aged 22-72 years, with disease duration of 13 +/- 7 years, underwent
      scanning of the spine, hip, forearm, and whole-body BMD by dual-energy X-ray
      absorptiometry (DXA). Lean tissue, appendicular muscle mass (AMM), and fat mass
      were derived by DXA and grip strength by dynamometry. Medical history, medication
      usage, clinical variables, and nutritional intake were obtained by questionnaire.
      Prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis was 32 and 17%, respectively, with
      osteopenia more common at the hip and osteoporosis more common at the spine. In
      multiple regression analyses, AMM was an independent predictor of whole-body and 
      regional BMD whereas lean mass was an independent predictor at the hip. Neither
      grip strength nor fat mass was independently associated with BMD. Of the
      components of body composition, muscle mass was strongly associated with regional
      and whole-body BMD. Preserving or augmenting muscle mass in this population may
      be a useful strategy to preserve BMD and thereby reduce fracture risk.

PG  - 491-503
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0b013e3283196b03 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neither the rate of endoscopic remission (ER) in Crohn's disease (CD)
      after therapy nor its role in patients' prognosis is well defined. AIM: To
      systematically review the current evidence on the proportion of ER of different
      therapies in patients with Crohn's disease and its relation with clinical
      outcomes. METHODS: Databases (MEDLINE and Cochrane) and manual search of
      manuscripts found 482 titles. Data was extracted from 24 manuscripts. RESULTS:
      Ten different methods were used to assess endoscopic outcomes. Corticosteroids
      induced a pooled proportion of patients with no ulcerations at endoscopic
      follow-up of 17% (95% confidence interval: 12-22%) lower than that found with
      infliximab [44% (34-53%)], diet [43% (33-52%)] or azathioprine [54% (38-69%)]
      (P<0.0001). Enteric diets and infliximab were associated with 61% (52-70%) and
      70% (62-78%) reduction in endoscopic scores, respectively, significantly higher
      than corticosteroids [45% (39-52%)] (P=0.01) and placebo [12% (1-22%)]
      (P<0.0001). A linear relation between ER and clinical remission was observed with
      infliximab (r=0.931). Only one study tried to assess the direct correlation
      between ER and patients' prognosis. CONCLUSION: Available treatments induce
      significant endoscopic improvement. However, pooled results should be cautiously 
      interpreted because of the diversity of measurements. A better definition of
      endoscopic outcomes and a prospective validation of their relevance in patients
      with Crohn's disease are needed.

PG  - 1-6
LID - 10.1111/j.1751-2980.2008.00355.x [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has long been considered a disease that affects 
      predominantly a Western population. The incidence and prevalence rates from Asian
      populations are much lower in comparison. More recent data, however, have shown
      significantly higher rates in Asians and time trend studies have shown an
      increase in the incidence of ulcerative colitis (UC) and a similar but lower rise
      in Crohn's disease (CD). The epidemiological changes that are taking place mirror
      that of the Western experience seen 50 years previously and seem to occur in
      parallel with the rapid socioeconomic development taking place in Asia. It
      appears that certain racial groups are more prone than others to develop IBD. For
      instance, Indians in South-East Asia have higher rates compared to Chinese and
      Malays. While there is host genetic predisposition, environmental factor(s) may
      be responsible for this difference. Migrant studies of South Asians in the UK,
      where second-generation immigrants have assumed incidence rates as high as the
      indigenous whites and Asian Jews who develop high incidence rates comparable to
      Jews from Europe or North America in Israel point to the role of environmental
      factors. It is unclear which specific factors are responsible. Studies have
      suggested a change in diet to a more Westernized one may underlie this
      epidemiological change in the Asian population. It is likely that there are
      racial groups amongst Asians who are more susceptible to IBD and who will
      demonstrate a higher frequency of IBD when exposed to putative environmental
      factors.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Crohn's disease (CD) may lead to protein and calorie malnutrition
      (PCM) secondary to impaired digestive and absorptive functions of the small
      intestine and sometimes to the influence of diet taboos. The earlier the PCM is
      diagnosed, the higher are the odds of reversal. The objective of this study was
      to compare different methods of nutritional assessment in patients with CD and
      correlate them with the disease characteristics. SAMPLE: The sample comprised 75 
      patients with CD from the Gastroenterology Service at the Hospital de Clinicas de
      Porto Alegre; 37 were male, with a mean age of 38.2 years old (SD = 13.3). All
      patients had been in clinical remission (CDAI <150) for over 3 months. They were 
      not receiving enteral or parenteral nutrition. The nutritional assessment was
      considered: body mass index (BMI), triceps skin fold (TSF), arm circumference
      (MAC), arm muscle circumference (MAMC), subjective global assessment (SGA),
      non-dominating handgrip strength (HGS) and food intake inquiries. RESULTS: When
      comparing the different nutritional assessment methods, 26.7% of the patients
      were malnourished according to the MAC, 29.3% according to the MAMC, 18.7%
      according to the SGA, 6.7% according to the BMI, 37.3% according to the TSF and
      73.3% according to the HGS. No statistically significant associations were found 
      for disease location, its behavior, drugs utilized, ESR, CRP, age of patients and
      disease time with the nutritional state verified by HGS, TSF, MAMC and SGA.
      CONCLUSION: The prevalence of malnutrition is significant in patients with CD,
      even in clinical remission. The BMI should not be used as reference in this
      population. The HGS detected a high prevalence of nutritional risk in patients
      with CD in remission. Studies are required that correlate it with more sensitive 
      methods, for the patients' effective nutritional state assessment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactobacilli are used in an attempt to maintain remission for Crohn
      disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and adverse events of
      Lactobacilli compared with placebo in maintenance therapy for Crohn disease.
      METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register,
      OVID and BIOSIS. All randomized trials comparing Lactobacilli with placebo in
      maintenance therapy for Crohn disease were included. RESULTS: Six randomized
      controlled trials with a total of 359 participants met the inclusion criteria.
      From the meta-analyses, the relative risk (RR) of clinical relapse rate was 1.15 
      (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90-1.48) comparing Lactobacilli with placebo and 
      RR of endoscopic relapse rate was 1.31 (95%CI 0.57-3.00). Subgroup analyses
      showed RR for clinical relapse rates of Lactobacilli versus placebo was 0.99
      (95%CI 0.76-1.29) in adults, 1.85 (95%CI 1.00-3.41) in children, 1.68 (95%CI
      1.07-2.64) in Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG and 0.91 (95%CI 0.68-1.23) in
      Lactobacillus johnsonii respectively. The pooled RR of adverse events was 0.83
      (95%CI 0.61-1.12). CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis suggests that compared with
      placebo, administration of L. rhamnosus strain GG as maintenance therapy may
      increase the relapse rates of Crohn disease. L. johnsonii is inefficacious in
      reducing the incidence of relapse.

      patients with suspected small bowel disease.
PG  - 733-43
LID - 10.1111/j.1445-5994.2008.01843.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Computed tomography enteroclysis (CTE) may be superior to other small
      bowel imaging techniques, detecting subtle mucosal lesions and extraluminal
      pathology. This study aimed to define the technical success, clinical influence
      and tolerance of CTE in patients with suspected small bowel disease. METHODS: CTE
      scans of 42 consecutive patients (aged 21-78 years, 12 men) were reviewed by a
      single radiologist for technical adequacy and diagnosis. A panel of
      gastroenterologists reviewed clinical information. At a telephone interview,
      tolerance of CTE was graded numerically from 1 (unbearable) to 10 (excellent) and
      descriptively as unbearable, fair, good or excellent. RESULTS: Good or optimal
      distension of small bowel was achieved in 98%. The entire small bowel was imaged 
      in 88%. Eighteen patients had a normal small bowel, whereas 12 (29%) had active
      small bowel Crohn disease, 4 intussusception, 3 small bowel diverticula and 7
      having other diagnoses. Mesenteric lymphadenopathy was evident in 11 and fat
      stranding in 5. CTE resulted in a new or altered diagnosis in 13 (31%) patients
      and identified more extensive Crohn disease in a further 8 (19%). A change in
      management plan was instituted in 18 (43%) patients, with subsequent clinically
      significant improvement in 12. 33 (85%) described the procedure as 'fair' or
      'unbearable' rather than 'good' or 'excellent'. The median tolerance score was 3 
      out of 10. CONCLUSION: CTE provided high-quality images in nearly all patients
      and had an effect on diagnosis, management or outcome in most, but was not well
      tolerated.

AB  - The exact aetiology of Crohn's disease remains unknown. The consensus is that the
      disease results from a complex interaction between genes, immunity and
      environmental factors. Diet is attractive, in theory, as an environmental risk
      factor in the aetiology of the disease. The epidemiological data, often impeded
      by methodological issues, have failed to confirm a direct link between pre-diet
      illness and the development of Crohn's disease. Once diagnosed, however,
      nutrition has an important role in disease management. Among the nutritional
      issues are malnutrition, weight loss and suboptimal nutritional status; these
      outcomes may be present at any stage of the disease but are likely to be overt
      during acute illness and hospitalisation. Malnutrition has been identified in
      approximately 40% of hospital admissions with Crohn's disease and is associated
      with higher mortality, longer hospital stays and higher healthcare costs.
      Patients in remission may indeed be overweight and appear to be influenced by the
      general population trends toward overweight and obesity. Irrespective of BMI,
      patients are at risk of micronutrient deficiencies. Vitamin D deficiency, for
      example, is common in Crohn's disease and has important implications for bone
      health. Moreover, newer evidence suggests that vitamin D has potential
      anti-inflammatory effects. Dietary approaches, in the form of enteral nutrition, 
      have previously been shown to reduce inflammation and treat the active disease.
      Current guidelines now recommend that corticosteroids are more effective than
      enteral nutrition for treating adults. Enteral nutrition has important growth and
      developmental benefits and continues to be a recommended therapy for children
      with Crohn's disease.

TI  - Surgical treatment of complex enterocutaneous fistulas in IBD patients using
      human acellular dermal matrix.
PG  - 1208-12
LID - 10.1002/ibd.20882 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients represent a high-risk group
      for enterocutaneous fistula (ECF) formation, related to both their disease
      process and the need for multiple surgeries. Often the abdominal wall is
      significantly involved with the ECF and requires partial resection. The use of
      synthetic prosthetic material to reconstruct the abdominal wall after ECF surgery
      is associated with increased risk of infection and recurrent fistulas. Herein we 
      report the use human acellular dermal matrix (hADM) in the surgical treatment and
      reconstruction of the abdominal wall in 11 consecutive IBD patients with complex 
      and medically refractory ECF. METHODS: After resection of the involved bowel
      segment and the overlying abdominal wall, a single sheet of hADM was used to
      reconstruct the defect. Pre- and perioperative risk factors were reviewed and
      patients were followed prospectively for a year (360 +/- 118 days). RESULTS:
      Operative mortality was nil. Three patients (27%) developed subcutaneous seroma
      and there were 2 cases (18%) of superficial wound infection, all of which
      resolved with conservative management. The mean length of hospital stay was 13.5 
      (+/-7.2) days and all patients were tolerating an oral diet at the time of
      dismissal. There were no recurrences. One patient with Crohn's disease developed 
      a new ECF from a separate bowel site on postoperative day 145, which was treated 
      with the same surgical approach. No further complications have occurred.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that in a high-risk IBD patient population with
      multiple perioperative risk factors the use of hADM during ECF takedown is an
      effective and well-tolerated treatment option.

PG  - CD006320
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD006320.pub3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The anti-inflammatory effects of n-3 (omega-3 fatty acids, fish oil) 
      have been suggested to be beneficial in chronic inflammatory disorders such as
      inflammatory bowel disease. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the efficacy and
      safety of n-3 for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease (CD). SEARCH
      STRATEGY: The following databases were searched from their inception without
      language restriction: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE,
      EMBASE, Healthstar, PubMed, and ACP journal club. Experts were contacted for
      unpublished data. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCT) 
      of n-3 for maintenance of remission in CD were included. Studies must have
      enrolled patients of any age group, who were in remission at the time of
      recruitment, and were followed for at least six months. The intervention must
      have been fish oil or n-3 given in pre-defined dosage. Co-interventions were
      allowed only if they were balanced between the study groups. The primary outcome 
      was the relapse rate and secondary outcomes included change in disease activity
      scores, time to first relapse and adverse events. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:
      Two independent investigators reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted the
      data and assessed study quality using Jadad's criteria. Meta-analyses were
      performed using RevMan 4.2 software weighted by the Mantel-Haenszel method.
      Random or fixed effect models were used according to degree of heterogeneity and 
      subgroup analyses were performed in an attempt to explore possible sources of
      heterogeneity. MAIN RESULTS: Six studies were eligible for inclusion. There was a
      marginal significant benefit of n-3 therapy for maintaining remission (RR 0.77
      0.; 95%CI 0.61 to 0.98; P = 0.03). However, the studies were both clinically and 
      statistically heterogeneous (P = 0.03, I(2) = 58%). Two large studies showed
      negative results. When considering the estimated rather than the observed 1-year 
      relapse rate of these two studies, the benefit was no longer statistically
      significant (RR 0.59; 95% CI 0.34 to 1.03; P=0.06). A funnel plot suggested
      publication bias. No serious adverse events were recorded in any of the studies
      but in a pooled analyses there was a significantly higher rate of diarrhea (RR
      1.36 95% CI 1.01 to 1.84) and symptoms of the upper gastrointestinal tract (RR
      1.98 95% CI 1.38 to 2.85) in the n-3 treatment group. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Omega
      3 fatty acids are safe but probably ineffective for maintenance of remission in
      CD. The existing data do not support routine maintenance treatment of Crohn's
      disease with omega 3 fatty acids.

      were assessed in 60 CD and 34 UC. RESULTS: No differences in clinical parameters 
      were observed in the two groups. Total cholesterol correlated inversely with the 
      number of bowel movements in both groups and directly with BMI in UC. Arachidonic
      acid correlated inversely with HBAI in UC and total and HDL cholesterol were
      inversely related to C-reactive protein (CRP) in CD while HDL correlated with CRP
      in UC. Docosapentaenoic acid was the only polyunsaturated n-3 FA that was
      correlated to CRP in both groups. Total cholesterol was independently associated 
      in the multiple regression analysis with the number of bowel movements and
      systemic inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Total and LDL cholesterol were lower in the
      active UC and CD than in the healthy subjects and were correlated with the
      systemic inflammatory status. Phospholipid FA composition was correlated to the
      systemic inflammatory status, but was unrelated to dietary intake and intestinal 
      disease activity.

TI  - Quality of life of patients and medical cost of "half elemental diet" as
      maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease: secondary outcomes of a randomised
      controlled trial.
PG  - 390-4
LID - 10.1016/j.dld.2008.09.007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Quality of life (QOL) of the patients and medical costs are
      important in current medical treatments, especially those for chronic diseases.
      We have reported the effectiveness of 'half elemental diet (ED)' as maintenance
      therapy for patients with Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this study was to
      evaluate the QOL of CD patients and medical costs of half-ED. METHODS: Fifty-one 
      CD patients in remission were randomly assigned to a half-ED group (n=26) or a
      free diet group (n=25). The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of relapse
      during a 2-year period. This time, we investigated the QOL of the patients and
      medical costs of half-ED, as secondary outcomes. QOL was evaluated using the
      Japanese version of the IBDQ scoring system, and medical costs were calculated
      monthly from the receipts. RESULTS: IBDQ score was not significantly different
      between the two groups at 1 and 13 months after the start of maintenance
      treatment. Medical costs were not significantly different between them either.
      This study showed that half-ED therapy did not affect the treatment of CD
      patients, neither regarding their QOL nor medical costs. CONCLUSION: This study
      has confirmed this half-ED therapy is beneficial for patients with Crohn's
      disease.

      fragment length polymorphism analysis.
PG  - 75-82

AB  - BACKGROUND: Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analyses
      are powerful tools to assess the diversity of complex microbiota. T-RFLPs permit 
      rapid comparisons of microbiota from many samples. AIM: To perform T-RFLP
      analyses of faecal microbiota in Crohn's disease (CD) patients to investigate
      potential alterations in faecal microbial communities and furthermore to analyse 
      the effects of elemental diet on faecal microbiota profiles. METHODS: Thirty-four
      patients with CD and 30 healthy individuals were enrolled in the study. DNA was
      extracted from stool samples and 16S rRNA genes were amplified by PCR. PCR
      products were digested with BslI restriction enzymes and T-RF lengths were
      determined. RESULTS: Faecal microbial communities were classified into seven
      clusters. Almost all healthy individuals (28/30) were included in cluster I, II
      and III, but the majority of CD patients (25/34) could be divided into another
      four clusters (cluster IV-VII). Prediction of bacteria based on the BslI-digested
      T-RFLP database showed a significant decrease in Clostridium cluster IV,
      Clostridium cluster XI and subcluster XIVa in CD patients. In contrast,
      Bacteroides significantly increased in CD patients. Significant increases in
      Enterobacteriales were also observed in CD patients. Furthermore, elemental diets
      modulated faecal bacterial communities in CD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Terminal
      restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses showed that the diversity of
      faecal microbiota in patients with CD differed from that of healthy individuals. 
      Furthermore, elemental diets modulated faecal microbiota composition, and this
      effect may be involved in mechanisms of clinical effects of elemental diet.

TI  - High prevalence of vitamin K and D deficiency and decreased BMD in inflammatory
      bowel disease.
PG  - 935-42
LID - 10.1007/s00198-008-0764-2 [doi]
AB  - SUMMARY: Vitamin K and D deficiency and decreased bone mineral density (BMD) were
      highly prevalent in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially
      Crohn's disease (CD). Dietary intakes of these vitamins, however, were above the 
      Japanese adequate intakes in IBD patients, suggesting that malabsorption is the
      basis for hypovitaminosis K and D and decreased BMD. INTRODUCTION: We have
      studied the possible involvement of vitamin K and D deficiency in the
      pathogenesis of decreased BMD in IBD. METHODS: Seventy patients with IBD were
      evaluated for their BMD; plasma levels of vitamin K; phylloquinone (PK),
      menaquinone-7 (MK-7), and 25OH-D; serum PTH, protein induced by vitamin K absence
      (PIVKA-II), and undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) levels; and their food
      intake. RESULTS: Compared with ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, CD patients had 
      significantly lower plasma vitamin K and 25OH-D concentrations; significantly
      higher serum levels of PTH, PIVKA-II, and ucOC; and significantly lower BMD
      scores at almost all measurement sites. More IBD patients were vitamin K
      deficient in bone than in liver. Multiple regression analyses revealed that low
      plasma concentrations of vitamin K and 25OH-D were independent risk factors for
      low BMD and that they were associated with the patients' fat intake, but not with
      their intake of these vitamins. CONCLUSION: IBD patients have high prevalence of 
      decreased BMD and vitamin K and D deficiency probably caused by malabsorption of 
      these vitamins.

PG  - 149-55
LID - 10.1007/s00431-008-0721-2 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is uncommon in children younger than 2 years of 
      age. The criteria for differentiating IBD from other diseases with similar
      clinical presentation is unclear. We describe 16 patients who, between 1984 and
      2004, received a histological diagnosis of IBD during the first two years of
      life. Six patients presented with histological Crohn's disease, eight with
      ulcerative colitis and two with indeterminate colitis. The median age at
      diagnosis was 125 days (range 1 day to 18 months) and the medium follow up was 89
      months (range 65 days to 20 years). The disease appeared to be very severe: four 
      children (25%) underwent total parenteral nutrition (TPN), two received colectomy
      (12.5%) and three patients died. Many of the patients required an aggressive,
      multidrug, immunosuppressive approach (azathioprine [AZA], Infliximab,
      thalidomide, cyclosporine A). One child presented with a hypogammaglobulinaemia
      without any specific immunodeficiency, while in the other patients,
      Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) (4 cases) and chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) 
      (2 cases) were identified. In 6/16 cases, allergic colitis was first considered; 
      these cases initially underwent cow's milk protein-free diet as the only therapy 
      before IBD was finally diagnosed. In conclusion, early IBD has a severe prognosis
      and often needs an aggressive therapeutic approach. Furthermore, an improper
      diagnosis of allergic colitis might cause an important diagnostic delay. Some
      severe immunodeficiencies, such as WAS and CGD, may represent a problem in terms 
      of differential diagnosis and might be wrongly diagnosed as very early onset IBD.
