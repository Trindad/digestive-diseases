TI  - Dietary sources of inorganic microparticles and their intake in healthy subjects 
      and patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 947-55
AB  - Dietary microparticles are non-biological, bacterial-sized particles. Endogenous 
      sources are derived from intestinal Ca and phosphate secretion. Exogenous sources
      are mainly titanium dioxide (TiO2) and mixed silicates (Psil); they are resistant
      to degradation and accumulate in human Peyer's patch macrophages and there is
      some evidence that they exacerbate inflammation in Crohn's disease (CD). However,
      whether their intake differs between those with and without CD has not been
      studied. We aimed to identify dietary microparticle sources and intakes in
      subjects with and without CD. Patients with inactive CD and matched general
      practice-based controls (ninety-one per group) completed 7 d food diaries. Intake
      data for dietary fibre and sucrose were compared as positive controls. All foods,
      pharmaceuticals and toothpastes were examined for microparticle content, and
      intakes of Ca and exogenous microparticles were compared between the two groups. 
      Dietary intakes were significantly different between cases and controls for
      dietary fibre (12 (SD 5) v. 14 (SD 5) g/d; P=0.001) and sucrose (52 (SD 27) v. 45
      (SD 18) g/d; P=0.04) but not for Ca. Estimated median TiO2 and Psil intakes (2.5 
      and 35 mg/individual per d respectively, totalling 10(12)-10(13)
      microparticles/individual per d) were broadly similar to per capita estimates and
      while there was wide variation in intakes between individuals there was no
      significant difference between subjects with CD and controls. Hence, if exposure 
      to microparticles is associated with the inflammation of CD, then the present
      study rules out excess intake as the problem. Nonetheless,
      microparticle-containing foods have now been identified which allows a
      low-microparticle diet to be further assessed in CD.

TI  - Association of Crohn's disease and latent celiac disease: a case report and
      review of the literature.
PG  - 376-80
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the intestine
      potentially affecting all parts of the intestine with predilection sites in the
      terminal ileum and proximal colon. Its prevalence in Western Europe is
      20-40/100,000 with equal affection of both sexes and familiar accumulation.
      Histopathologically, it is characterized by a discontinuous, segmental
      manifestation and implication of all intestinal layers. Celiac disease, on the
      other hand, is defined by histologically proven villous atrophy associated with
      hyperplasia of crypts, lymphocytic infiltration and clinical improvement after a 
      gluten-free diet. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 52-year-old man presenting
      with long-term diarrhea and loss of weight associated with Crohn's disease. After
      interventional therapy for an unstable coronary artery syndrome and medical
      therapy for hyperthyroidism, the diarrhea stopped only after maintaining a
      gluten-free diet. A latent form of celiac disease (clinical symptoms, improvement
      after gluten-free diet, detection of anti-gliadin IgA antibodies, negative
      histology) was diagnosed. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first report 
      on the association of Crohn's disease and the latent form of celiac disease in
      the same patient. Whereas in most cases, Crohn's disease develops secondary to a 
      pre-existing celiac disease, in our patient, latent celiac disease was diagnosed 
      years after the onset of and therapy for Crohn's disease.

TI  - [Environmental factors in the etiopathology of inflammatory bowel syndrome].
PG  - 97-105
AB  - Inflammatory bowel syndrome (IBS) mainly includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and
      Crohn's disease (CD). UC and CD are chronic and recurrent conditions, with a
      tendency to exacerbations and remissions. The incidence of diseases worldwide has
      increased over the last years. Although the etiology of inflammatory bowel
      syndrome has been studied intensively it still remains unclear. The development
      and persistence of inflammation is an effect of numerous factors: proinflammatory
      (aggressive), regulating bowel mucosa homeostasis and protective factors.
      Proinflammatory factors include intestinal bacteria, bile acids, digestive
      enzymes, lipopolysaccharides and peptidoglycans. Protective mechanisms are
      impermeability of mucosa barrier, presence of intestinal mucus, activity of
      secretive immunoglobulins, some prostaglandins and interleukins, glutamine,
      somatostatin, cortisol and short-chain fatty acids. Factors modifying intestinal 
      mucosa homeostasis consist of genetically determined immunoregulators and
      activity of intestinal mucosa barrier and some environmental factors (diet,
      smoking, infections, stress, antibiotics and others). Environmental factors are
      jointly responsible for IBS occurrence in case of genetically determined
      dysregulation leading to proinflammatory cytokines overproduction or disturbances
      in synthesis of cytokines regulating intestinal mucosa homeostasis.

TI  - Reduced joint pain after short-term duodenal administration of seal oil in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease: comparison with soy oil.
PG  - 1088-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rheumatic joint pain is a common extra-intestinal complication of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Because the high ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty
      acids (FAs) of the Western diet might promote rheumatic disorders, we sought to
      compare the effects of short-term duodenal administration of n-3-rich seal oil
      and n-6-rich soy oil on IBD-related joint pain. METHODS: Nineteen patients with
      IBD-related joint pain were included in the study; 9 had Crohn disease and 10 had
      ulcerative colitis. Ten millilitres seal oil (n = 10) or soy oil (n = 9) was
      self-administered through a nasoduodenal feeding tube 3 times daily for 10 days. 
      RESULTS: Compared with soy oil treatment, seal oil significantly reduced the
      duration of morning stiffness (P = 0.024), number of tender joints (P = 0.035),
      intensity of pain (P = 0.025) and the doctor's scoring of rheumatic disease
      activity (P = 0.025) at the end of the 10-day treatment period. Analysis of the
      effects as area under the curve (area between the curve and baseline, zero) for
      the entire period from start of treatment until 6 months' post-treatment
      suggested a long-lasting beneficial effect of seal oil administration on joint
      pain, whereas soy oil tended (not significantly) to aggravate the condition.
      Consistently, the serum ratios of n-6 to n-3 FAs (P < 0.01) and arachidonic acid 
      to eicosapentaenoic acid (P < 0.01) were reduced after treatment with seal oil.
      CONCLUSION: The results suggest distinctive, differential prolonged effects on
      IBD-related joint pain of short-term duodenal administration of n-3-rich seal oil
      (significant improvement) and n-6-rich soy oil (tendency to exacerbation).

TI  - Review article: chronic active disease and maintaining remission in Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 102-5
AB  - The clinical management of Crohn's disease can be considered in relation to the
      treatment of acute disease and the maintenance of remission. The medication used 
      to achieve these two goals may or may not be the same. Some patients with mildly 
      active disease may respond to high-dose (4 g/day) mesalazine (mesalamine), and
      5-aminosalicylic acid may also be helpful in weaning a patient off steroids after
      treatment for a flare-up. However, the value of 5-aminosalicylic acid in
      maintaining remission in Crohn's disease remains controversial. Subgroups of
      patients may be helped: for example, patients with Crohn's disease who have
      experienced a relapse within the last 2 years may benefit. Steroids form the
      first-line therapy for acute episodes of inflammation but do not maintain
      remission. Azathioprine and mercaptopurine are the first-line drugs for the
      maintenance of remission in moderate to severe Crohn's disease, and by titrating 
      the dose up from 2 mg/kg daily, some previously resistant patients will be
      brought into remission. One-half of patients who do not tolerate azathioprine
      will tolerate mercaptopurine. Methotrexate is effective in inducing and
      maintaining remission, and is useful for patients who fail azathioprine
      treatment. Thalidomide is not proven in controlled studies, but two open studies 
      have demonstrated its efficacy. The optimal dose, however, remains to be defined.
      Purified liquid diets with food exclusion can induce remission in patients with
      active disease, but food exclusion is difficult to maintain long term. Infliximab
      can induce and maintain remission in patients resistant to other therapies, with 
      two-thirds of patients initially responding to treatment. One-third go into
      remission and, of those who respond to a single treatment, approximately one-half
      maintain remission when treated regularly for a year. Infliximab is, however,
      associated with an increased risk of infection, and its effect on cancer
      incidence is uncertain. The development of antibodies against the drug is
      associated with a loss of effect and allergic infusion reactions. In summary,
      simple proven therapies should be used first, because of their safety and benefit
      in some patients. However, aggressive therapy should be used when needed.

TI  - Review article: the role of nutrition in the treatment of inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 79-83
AB  - Nutrients may be involved in the modulation of the immune response through at
      least three different mechanisms. First, the intestinal ecosystem plays a pivotal
      role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, triggering the
      uncontrolled inflammatory response in genetically predisposed individuals.
      Nutrients, together with bacteria, are major components of, and can therefore
      influence, the intestinal environment. Second, as components of cell membranes,
      nutrients can mediate the expression of proteins involved in the immune response,
      such as cytokines, adhesion molecules and nitric oxide synthase. The composition 
      of lipids in the cell membrane is modified by dietary changes and can influence
      cellular responses. Indeed, various epidemiological, experimental and clinical
      data suggest that the immune response may be sensitive to changes in dietary
      composition. Finally, suboptimal levels of micronutrients are often found in both
      children and adults with inflammatory bowel disease, although, with the exception
      of iron and folate, it is unusual to discover symptoms attributable to these
      deficits. However, subclinical deficits may have a pathophysiological
      significance, as they may favour the self-perpetuation of the disease (due to
      defects in the mechanisms of tissue repair), cause defective defence against
      damage produced by oxygen free radicals and facilitate lipid peroxidation. These 
      events can occur even in clinically inactive or mildly active disease, as well as
      in the development of dysplasia in the intestinal mucosa. Some dietary
      manipulations have been attempted as primary treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, 
      and specially formulated diets for enteral nutrition have proved to be an
      effective treatment for Crohn's disease. Most trials, although lacking sufficient
      patient numbers, have demonstrated a role for dietary manipulation as primary
      therapy for inflammatory disease. Dietary lipids are one of the most active
      nutritional substrates modulating the immune response. Recently, it has been
      demonstrated that lipids may be a key factor explaining the therapeutic effect of
      clinical nutrition in Crohn's disease.

TI  - Allergic eosinophilic gastroenteritis in a child with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 159-61
AB  - A case of a child with Crohn's disease who developed an eosinophilic
      gastroenteritis is reported. Although symptoms of eosinophilic gastroenteritis at
      age 8 could mimic those of Crohn's disease, laboratory, radiographic and
      histologically studies are clearly different. Peripheral blood eosinophilia
      (7,476 cells per mm3), high serum IgE level (1,050 kU/l) and normal C-reactive
      protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are common in eosinophilic
      gastroenteritis and uncommon in Crohn's disease. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis was
      due to bovine serum albumin (BSA) hypersensitivity, confirmed with skin tests,
      serum levels to specific IgE and a SDS-PAGE IgE-immunoblotting. A strict
      meat-free diet was started, with progressive relief of symptoms and decrease of
      eosinophil count twelve months later; the patient became fully symptom-free and
      eosinophil count was normal.

TI  - Mining MEDLINE for implicit links between dietary substances and diseases.
PG  - i290-6
AB  - MOTIVATION: Text mining systems aim at knowledge discovery from text collections.
      This work presents our text mining algorithm and demonstrates its use to uncover 
      information that could form the basis of new hypotheses. In particular, we use it
      to discover novel uses for Curcuma longa, a dietary substance, which is highly
      regarded for its therapeutic properties in Asia. RESULTS: Several disease were
      identified that offer novel research contexts for curcumin. We analyze select
      suggestions, such as retinal diseases, Crohn's disease and disorders related to
      the spinal cord. Our analysis suggests that there is strong evidence in favor of 
      a beneficial role for curcumin in these diseases. The evidence is based on
      curcumin's influence on several genes, such as COX-2, TNF-alpha, JNK, p38 MAPK
      and TGF-beta. This research suggests that our discovery algorithm may be used to 
      suggest novel uses for dietary and pharmacological substances. More generally,
      our text mining algorithm may be used to uncover information that potentially
      sheds new light on a given topic of interest. AVAILABILITY: Contact authors.

TI  - Efficacy of nutritional therapy for perforating and non-perforating Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 1050-2
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Enteral nutrition is the currently established primary therapy
      for Crohn's disease in Japan. We examined the effects of postoperative
      nutritional therapy in patients with perforating type and non-perforating type
      Crohn's disease. METHODOLOGY: We retrospectively reviewed the records for 218
      patients who underwent surgical interventions for Crohn's disease in our hospital
      between January 1, 1974 and September 30, 2001. They were divided into four
      groups: 92 patients in the non-perforating type (NP type) + Elemental Diet (ED)
      group had received ED therapy and nutritional education, 22 patients in the NP
      type + NoED group had not received ED therapy or nutritional education, 88
      patients in the perforating type (P type) + ED group and 16 patients in P type + 
      NoED group. We evaluated the incidence of reoperation rate for each group.
      RESULTS: Patients with a postoperative ED therapy demonstrated a significant
      decrease in the incidence of second resection. The incidence of second resection 
      in the NP type + ED group was significantly lower than that of the other groups. 
      The NP type + NoED group and the P type + ED group followed similar courses.
      CONCLUSIONS: In patients with Crohn's disease postoperative ED therapy and
      nutritional education is effective in reducing the incidence of second resection.
      It appears that postoperative ED therapy and nutritional education is more
      important in patients with P type Crohn's disease.

TI  - [Early results of laparoscopic surgical procedures in Crohn's disease].
PG  - 200-4
AB  - INTRODUCTION: During the last years laparoscopic surgical procedures are used
      more frequently in benign bowel diseases like Crohn's disease. We are reporting
      early results of laparoscopic procedures in Crohn's disease at our hospital.
      PATIENTS AND METHOD: From 1994 to 2003 54 patients (20 male and 34 female)
      underwent laparoscopic colonic and small bowel surgery in Crohn's disease. The
      mean age was 32 years (range: 16 to 55 years). RESULTS: Complications occurred in
      6 patients (11.1 %). 3 patients needed a laparotomy. One computed tomography
      puncture was performed due to a hematoma. The remaining patients are treated
      successfully non-operatively. No patient died during the perioperative period.
      The mean operating time was 152 minutes (range 35 to 360 minutes) and the mean
      postoperative stay in hospital was 10 days (range 6-35 days). 0.2 blood cell
      concentrates were needed per operation (range 0 to 6), on average. The patients
      needed no analgesics after the 5 (th) day (range 1 to 13 days), got liquid diet
      on the 2 (nd) (range 0 to 6 days) and solid diet on the 3 (rd) day after surgery 
      (range 1 to 14 days). DISCUSSION: Laparoscopic surgery in Crohns disease is safe 
      when performed by an experienced surgeon. The laparoscopic procedure results in a
      better cosmetic result, while the longer operating time is the mean disadvantage.
      There are low complication rates during the early postoperative period.

TI  - Coeliac disease is the most common cause of chronic diarrhoea in Iran.
PG  - 665-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Coeliac disease (CD) is one of the most important causes of chronic
      diarrhoea. The prevalence of CD in patients with chronic diarrhoea in Iran
      remains unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of CD among
      100 Iranian patients with chronic non-bloody diarrhoea. METHODS: One hundred
      consecutive patients with chronic non-bloody diarrhoea of more than 6 weeks
      attending an academic centre in Iran were enrolled. Patients with bloody
      diarrhoea and renal failure were excluded. IgA endomysial antibody (IgA EMA), IgA
      antigliadin antibody (IgA AGA), and total serum IgA were tested in all patients. 
      Patients with negative IgA EMA were evaluated for other causes of chronic
      diarrhoea. Patients who had positive IgA EMA underwent upper gastrointestinal
      endoscopy and duodenal biopsy. Patients with a positive IgA EMA were advised to
      follow a gluten-free diet (GFD) strictly for 6 months, and then clinical
      symptoms, serological and haematological tests were re-assessed. RESULTS: A total
      of 100 patients (55 men and 45 women) with chronic non-bloody diarrhoea were
      studied. Mean age of the patients was 31 years. Total serum IgA was in the normal
      range in all participants. Twenty patients (12/45 women; 8/55 men) had positive
      IgA EMA. Fourteen of them also had a positive IgA AGA. CD was diagnosed in 19
      patients (19%). Small intestinal Crohn's disease, small intestinal lymphoma and
      idiopathic aetiology were the next. In patients with CD, after 6 months of a GFD,
      15 patients (75%) had a complete clinical response, three patients (15%) had a
      good response, and one patient (5%) had a partial response. One patient did not
      follow a GFD. CONCLUSION: CD is the most common cause of adult chronic non-bloody
      diarrhoea in Tehran.

TI  - Environmental risk factors (excluding tobacco and microorganisms): critical
      analysis of old and new hypotheses.
PG  - 497-508
AB  - The increase in incidence in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease during
      the 20th century has led to an abundance of different hypotheses on what sort of 
      exposures are responsible. There has been a special focus on dietary factors, as 
      well as on other exposures introduced on a population-based level, including fast
      food, cola drinks, toothpaste, antibiotics and oral contraceptives. The aim of
      this review is to critically assess the results from the different observational 
      studies that have investigated these hypotheses, and also to propose research
      agendas that should be pursued in the future. The conclusion is that infectious
      exposures and early bacterial colonization, which are associated with better
      hygiene early in life and that influence immune function, and possibly oral
      contraceptives, remain the only exposures of interest for future research into
      the aetiology of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.

TI  - Elemental versus polymeric enteral nutrition in paediatric Crohn's disease: a
      multicentre randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 327-35
AB  - AIM: To compare the efficacy and safety of an elemental and a polymeric diet as
      the primary therapy for active Crohn's disease in children. METHODS: In a
      randomized, non-blind, multicentre, controlled trial in Sweden, 16 children with 
      Crohn's disease received Elemental 028 Extra (E028E) and 17 Nutrison Standard
      (NuS). Remission rates (Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) < 10 or
      a PCDAI decrease of 40% or 15 points of initial level) were compared at 6 wk.
      RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the two groups in remission 
      rate at 6 wk (intent-to-treat analysis): E028E 11/16 (69%) and NuS 14/17 (82%) (p
      = 0.438). There was no difference in the decrease in PCDAI and CDAI between
      patients treated with E028E and those treated with NuS from 0 to 6 wk. Patients
      treated with NuS gained significantly more weight than patients treated with
      E028E (+2.5 kg; 95% CI 0.9, 4.1; p = 0.004), this difference remained when
      adjusting for maximum caloric intake per kilogram bodyweight (+2.9 kg; 95% CI
      1.4, 4.5; p = 0.001). Concomitant disease, complications and side effects were
      seen in 5/33 patients (pyelonephritis, pneumonia, intraabdominal abscess,
      perianal abscess and borborygmi). CONCLUSION: E028E and NuS did not differ in
      terms of remission rate. Patients treated with NuS gained more weight than
      patients with E028E. Polymeric diet may be superior to elemental diet in the
      treatment of paediatric Crohn's disease where the primary aim is to increase the 
      patient's weight.

TI  - Laparoscopic versus open ileocolic resection for Crohn's disease.
PG  - 61-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Laparoscopic ileocolic (LI) resection for Crohn's disease has several 
      potential advantages over the traditional open technique. The objective of this
      study was to compare early surgical outcomes in patients having laparoscopic
      versus open ileocolic resections for Crohn's disease. METHODS: Data collected
      prospectively from 21 patients having LI resection for Crohn's disease between
      1995 and 2001 were compared to data from 19 patients having open ileocolic
      resection for Crohn's disease between 1990 and 1995. RESULTS: Patients in both
      groups had similar ages, sex distribution, and rates of previous abdominal
      surgery. Mean operating time was not significantly different between the groups. 
      There was a nonsignificant trend to less postoperative analgesic requirement in
      the laparoscopic group. Resumption of liquid (P <.001) and solid (P =.01) diet,
      return of bowel function [flatus (P =.008), feces (P =.008)] and time to
      discharge (P =.001) all occurred significantly more quickly in the laparoscopic
      group. There was no difference in the rates of morbidity between the two groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: LI resection for Crohn's disease appears to be safe and has
      comparable if not superior results to open surgery in the short term.

      severe growth failure and delayed onset of puberty. She was found to have
      pan-enteric Crohn's disease and has done remarkably well on principally
      nutritional therapy with a significant growth spurt and the onset of menarche.
      The development of bowel disease whilst on immunosuppression is rare and the

TI  - Intake of dietary iron is low in patients with Crohn's disease: a case-control
      study.
PG  - 141-8
AB  - Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) often experience Fe deficiency (ID) and
      frequently alter their diet to relieve abdominal symptoms. The present study set 
      out to assess whether patients with CD have dietary habits that lead to low Fe
      intakes and/or reduced bioavailable Fe compared with control subjects. Patients
      with asymptomatic CD were matched to controls (n 91/group). Dietary intakes of Fe
      and contributions from different food groups were compared using a 7 d food
      diary. Promoters and inhibitors of non-haem Fe absorption were investigated and a
      recently published algorithm was applied to assess bioavailable Fe. Fewer
      patients than controls met the reference nutrient intake for Fe (32% CD patients 
      v. 42% controls). Overall, patients had significantly lower mean Fe intakes (by
      2.3 mg/d) and Fe density (by 0.26 mg/MJ (1.1 mg/1000 kcal)) compared with
      controls (both P<0.001). Differences were mainly due to a preference among CD
      patients for low-fibre non-Fe fortified cereals, particularly breakfast cereals. 
      In particular, control subjects had higher Fe intakes than matched CD subjects
      for men (P<0.001) and women less than 50 years (P=0.03). Intakes of both ascorbic
      acid (P<0.001) and phytic acid (P<0.01), but not animal tissue (P=1.0), were
      lower in patients with CD, but these had no overall effect on the predicted
      percentage of bioavailable Fe. Thus total bioavailable Fe was reduced in patients
      with CD due to lower intakes (P<0.01). Dietary Fe intakes are low in CD patients,
      which may contribute to an increased risk of ID and anaemia. Changing dietary
      advice may compromise perceived symptoms of the disease so the need for Fe
      supplementation should be carefully considered.

TI  - Crohn's disease: the cold chain hypothesis.
PG  - 2012-5
AB  - Crohn's disease is the result of an abnormal immune response of the gut mucosa
      triggered by one or more environmental risk factors in people with predisposing
      gene variations, including CARD15 mutations. Epidemiological data allow
      assessment of familial environmental risk factors related to western lifestyle,
      diet, bacteria, and domestic hygiene. All findings point to refrigeration as a
      potential risk factor for Crohn's disease. Furthermore, cold-chain development
      paralleled the outbreak of Crohn's disease during the 20th century. The cold
      chain hypothesis suggests that psychrotrophic bacteria such as Yersinia spp and
      Listeria spp contribute to the disease. These bacteria have been identified in
      Crohn's disease lesions and we discuss their pathogenic properties with respect
      to our knowledge of the disease. From a molecular perspective, we postulate that 
      the disease is a result of a defect in host recognition by pathogenic bacterial
      components that usually escape the immune response (eg, Yop molecules), which
      results in an excessive host response to these bacteria.

TI  - [Crohn disease and laparoscopic surgery].
PG  - 492-6
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate possibilities of laparoscopic surgery in the
      treatment of Crohn's disease. METHODS: A retrospective evaluation of the group of
      14 patients, operated on in the period of 2/1997 to 2/2003. RESULTS: In the group
      of 7 women and 7 men, laparoscopy was used for ileocecal resection in six cases
      (43%), resection of ileotransversoanastomosis in four cases (29%) and
      abdominal-peritoneal amputation of rectum once (7%). The surgical intervention
      lasted 125 min on the average. The post-operation complications were not recorded
      and the conversion was not necessary. The post-operation course was complicated
      by suppuration three times in laparotomy (21%) and once by paralytic ileus (7%), 
      which required one reoperation. The peristaltics was resumed in the 2nd
      post-operation day on the average, when the patients began to refuse analgesics. 
      The patients started to accept the liquid diet in the 3rd post-operation day on
      the average and stools appeared on the day 4 after the surgery. The median of
      post-operation hospitalization in cases of uncomplicated course was 8 days on the
      average. No patient was lost. CONCLUSIONS: The laparoscopic surgery represents a 
      safe alternative in the therapy of Crohn's disease, being associated with a more 
      favorable post-operation course and a better cosmetic effect in this group of
      patients with lower age average.

TI  - Food-induced antisecretory factor activity is correlated with small bowel length 
      in patients with intestinal resections.
PG  - 985-8
AB  - Specially processed cereals (SPC) can increase antisecretory factor (AF) activity
      in humans with an intact intestine. The aim of the present study was to
      investigate whether AF synthesis could be induced in patients who had been
      subjected to intestinal resections. Eight patients with varying extents of
      intestinal resections due to Crohn's disease and six healthy controls
      participated. All subjects received 54 g SPC daily for 2 weeks. Plasma AF
      activity was determined before, during and after the treatment period. Baseline
      diet and medications were kept unchanged. The patients registered the daily
      number of bowel movements. The SPC diet increased AF activity in all controls. In
      the patients there was a significant correlation between the length of the
      remaining small intestine and AF induction (r=0.94, p<0.01) and only those
      patients with a remaining small intestine of about 3 m reached AF values
      comparable to those in healthy subjects. It is concluded that small bowel length 
      is related to the ability of humans to induce AF activity by dietary means.

TI  - Linoleic acid, but not oleic acid, upregulates the production of interleukin-8 by
      human intestinal smooth muscle cells isolated from patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 529-35
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) 
      of unknown etiology. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that dietary
      fatty acids, linoleic acid (LA) and oleic acid (OA), could be involved in the
      inflammatory response through stimulation of the neutrophil chemokine, IL-8.
      METHODS: Human intestinal smooth muscle (HISM) cells were isolated from normal
      patients and patients with Crohn's disease and cultured for 24h with LA or OA in 
      the presence or absence of oxidative stress. The concentrations of IL-8 were
      measured in the media and cellular oxidative stress was quantitated by
      measurement of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARSs). RESULTS:
      Spontaneous production of IL-8 was significantly higher in HISM cells isolated
      from Crohn's bowel compared to control bowel. LA caused a marked, nine-fold,
      increase in IL-8 secretion by Crohn's cells, an effect that could be simulated in
      normal HISM cells by co-incubation of LA with an oxidizing solution (Ox) composed
      of hypoxanthine+xanthine oxidase+FeSO(4) (OxLA). These effects were inhibited by 
      vitamins C and E. Treatment of Crohn's cells with OxLA did not further increase
      IL-8 over that of LA alone. The effect of LA alone was not associated with an
      increase in cellular oxidative stress as quantitated by TBARSs. In contrast to
      the results with LA, treatment with OA or OxOA did not increase IL-8 in either
      normal or Crohn's cells. In addition, OA protected Crohn's cells from the
      increase in TBARSs induced by Ox. In contrast to IL-8, spontaneous production of 
      monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-1) was significantly lower in Crohn's HISM
      cells as compared to normal cells and exposure to OxLA did not increase its
      production. CONCLUSIONS: LA, but not OA, increased the production of IL-8 by HISM
      cells. These results suggest that replacement of LA by OA in the diet of Crohn's 
      patients and increased intake of a diet rich in antioxidants could be beneficial 
      in decreasing inflammatory activity in Crohn's disease.

TI  - [Epidemiology of inflammatory bowel diseases in Veszprem county of Western
      Hungary between 1977 and 2001].
PG  - 1819-27
AB  - INTRODUCTION: An epidemiological study of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in
      Veszprem county (located in western part of Hungary) was carried out from 1977 to
      2001. METHODS: Both hospital and outpatient records of IBD patients were
      collected reviewed carefully. Most patients have been followed up regularly.
      RESULTS: The number of population has decreased during the observed period from
      386,000 to 376,000. The county has both industrial and agrarian parts. 560 new
      ulcerative colitis (UC) cases, 212 Crohn's disease (CD), and 40 indeterminate
      colitides (IC) were diagnosed in the investigated period. Incidence rate
      increased from 1.66 (1977-1981) to 11.01 (1997-2001) in UC, and from 0.41 to 4.68
      in CD, respectively. The incidence rate in IC rose from 0.26 to 0.74. The M/F
      ratio in UC was 1.06, in CD: 1.03, respectively, 41 UD patients and 13 CD
      patients died, the cause of death was disease related in 6 UC and in 6 CD
      patients. The average age at death in UC was not different from that observed in 
      general population (66.4 years) but in CD (50.1 years) it was much earlier. The
      disease related mortality was low, 0.06/100,000 both in UC and CD. The prevalence
      rate at the end of 2001 was 142.6 for UC and 52.9/100,000 inhabitants for CD.
      Mean age at onset in UC was 38.9 +/- 15.5 years, in CD 31.7 +/- 12.8 years. We
      observed only one peak onset of the diseases, in UC it was between 30 and 40
      years, in CD between 20 and 30 years. People living in towns were more liable to 
      acquire the disease (ORUC = 1.27, ORCD = 1.13). The rate of smokers at the onset 
      was 14.3% (OR = 0.25) in UC and 50.5% (OR = 1.98) in CD. Ex-smokers were 18.4%
      and 6.4%. Family history of IBD was present in 3.4% in UC and 9.9% in CD. The
      location of UC (according to the known largest extent) was proctitis in 112
      cases, proctosigmoiditis in 162 cases, left sided colitis in 117 and subtotal or 
      pancolitis in 169 cases. The location of CD was only ileal in 68 cases,
      ileocolonic in 87 cases, colonic in 57 cases. The behaviour of CD was
      non-stricturing-non-penetrating in 63 cases, stricturing in 54 cases, penetrating
      in 95 cases. 59.4% of the CD patients had at least one operation, 6.1% had more
      than 3 operations. CONCLUSION: The incidence and prevalence rates have increased 
      steadily in Veszprem County, now it reaches that of most western European
      countries. There were no gender differences either in UC or CD. Smoking seemed to
      be a risk factor for CD, but it was preventive for UC. The rapid increase in
      incidence supports a role for environmental (e.g. diet, lifestyle changes) risk
      factors.

TI  - Hyperhomocystinemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 586-90
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Thromboembolism is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in 
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) 
      is a risk factor for vascular disease and has been implicated as a mediator of
      thromboembolic events in adults with IBD. The authors studied the link between
      tHcy and IBD in children, in whom associations may be clearer, and investigated
      associations with plasma von Willebrand factor antigen, a marker of vascular
      damage. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 43 patients with IBD (27
      Crohn disease, 9 ulcerative colitis, and 7 indeterminate colitis) and 46 control 
      subjects from a pediatric gastroenterology clinic. Plasma tHcy, plasma 5-methyl
      tetrahydrofolate, red cell folate, plasma vitamin B12, plasma von Willebrand
      factor antigen, and methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) genotype (for
      the C677T mutation) were measured. RESULTS: Plasma tHcy concentrations were
      higher in children with IBD than in control subjects, when corrected for age (P <
      0.05), and plasma tHcy was negatively correlated with plasma 5 methyl
      tetrahydrofolate (P < 0.0005). Plasma 5 methyl tetrahydrofolate and age were the 
      main predictors of plasma tHcy. Neither MTHFR genotype nor von Willebrand factor 
      showed any association with any other measure, and there were no differences
      between children with IBD and control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated plasma tHcy
      is a consequence of IBD in children, probably mediated by poor folate status
      associated with diet or the pathophysiology of the disease.

TI  - Standard therapy of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 146-56
AB  - Therapy of Crohn's disease is either counteracting the underlying mechanisms of
      bowel inflammation or specifically targeting certain complications of disease,
      e.g. strictures, fistulae, bacterial overgrowth, or anemia. The therapeutic
      arsenal is well defined and has been tested for safety and efficacy. There is
      need and opportunity to adapt therapies to individual situations. This is made on
      the basis of scientific facts that have been collected from randomized controlled
      trials and on the basis of reasoned thinking that weighs the potential effect
      against potential side effects in individual cases. In clinical practice, the
      potency of lifestyle changes such as smoking cessation is still underestimated
      and not extensively exploited. As the understanding of genetic mutations, their
      gene function and phenotypic expression grows, we anticipate that future
      treatment can be tailored to certain genotypes or phenotypes of Crohn's disease.

PG  - 91-104
AB  - Environmental factors play an important role in the disease manifestation, course
      and prognosis of inflammatory bowel disease. Observations on temporal trends and 
      geographical distribution point at risk factors associated with a Western
      lifestyle. A large number of studies have been performed on various factors such 
      as diet, smoking, and several infectious agents. Childhood exposures modifying
      immune responses in later life form a particularly interesting field. However, so
      far, only smoking in Crohn's disease, and smoking cessation in ulcerative colitis
      can be considered established as risk factors for the manifestation of the
      disease. Smoking is also associated with a poor prognosis in Crohn's disease. A
      strong negative association of appendectomy with ulcerative colitis has been very
      consistent across many studies; however, the implications of this finding are
      still obscure.

TI  - Enterohepatic cycling of bilirubin as a cause of 'black' pigment gallstones in
      adult life.
PG  - 799-810
AB  - In contrast to bile salts, which undergo a highly efficient enterohepatic
      circulation with multiple regulatory and physiologic functions, glucuronic acid
      conjugates of bilirubin are biliary excretory molecules that in health do not
      have a continuing biologic life. Intestinal absorptive cells are devoid of
      recapture transporters for bilirubin conjugates, and their large size and
      polarity prevent absorption by passive diffusion. However, unconjugated
      bilirubin, the beta-glucuronidase hydrolysis product of bilirubin glucuronides
      can be absorbed passively from any part of the small and large intestines. This
      can occur only if unconjugated bilirubin is kept in solution and does not undergo
      rapid bacterial reduction to form urobilinoids. Here we collect, and in some
      cases reinterpret, experimental and clinical evidence to show that in addition to
      the well-known occurrence in newborns, enterohepatic cycling of unconjugated
      bilirubin can reappear in adult life. This happens as a result of several common 
      conditions, particularly associated with bile salt leakage from the small
      intestine, the most notable ileal dysfunction resulting from any medical or
      surgical cause. We propose that when present in excess, colonic bile salts
      solubilize unconjugated bilirubin, delay urobilinoid formation, prevent calcium
      complexing of unconjugated bilirubin and promote passive absorption of
      unconjugated bilirubin from the large intestine. Following uptake, reconjugation,
      and resecretion into bile, this source of 'hyperbilirubinbilia' may be the
      important pathophysiological risk factor for 'black' pigment gallstone formation 
      in predisposed adult humans.

TI  - [Neurological complications of inflammatory intestinal diseases].
PG  - 406-14
AB  - A number of neurological symptoms have been described as complications of
      inflammatory bowel disorders such as coeliac disease, Whipple's disease, Crohn's 
      disease and ulcerative colitis. The neurology of coeliac disease includes
      disorders of the central nervous system encompassing cerebellar ataxia, epilepsy,
      myoclonus, dementia and multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Peripheral neuropathies, 
      of axonal and demyelinating types, and myopathies have also been reported. The
      pathomechanisms are more related to immunological-inflammatory processes than to 
      a malresorptive vitamin deficiencies. While CNS symptoms of coeliac disease show 
      a poor response to gluten restriction, peripheral symptoms may respond to
      elimination of gluten from the diet. There are few reports of a successful
      corticosteroid treatment in patients showing inflammatory findings in the CSF or 
      bioptic material. Whipple's disease is caused by the gram-positive bacillus
      Tropheryma whipplei. Patients with a central nervous system manifestation of
      Whipple's disease may develop a variety of symptoms including dementia,
      supranuclear gaze palsy, movement disorders, hypothalamic dysfunction and
      myorhythmia. The CNS-infection is diagnosed by PCR of the CSF. Long-term
      antibiotic treatment is required, and relapses may occur after withdrawal of
      antimicrobial therapy. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are complicated by 
      various forms of polyneuropathies, and arterial and venous cerebrovascular
      diseases. In most cases with neurological complications of inflammatory
      gastrointestinal diseases an immune mediated inflammatory process is suspected to
      be the underlying pathomechanism.

TI  - Complete remission of Crohn's disease after high-dose cyclophosphamide and
      autologous stem cell transplantation.
PG  - 337-40
AB  - In a 36-year-old male with ileocolic Crohn's disease (CD) no long-lasting
      remission was obtained by treatment with corticosteroids, mesalazine,
      azathioprine and antibiotics. Surgical interventions due to relapsing fistulae
      and abscesses resulted in the removal of >1.5 m of small bowel and left only 40
      cm of large bowel. In July 2000, a new fistula and abscess developed. The
      combination of corticosteroids, mesalazine, ciprofloxacin, metronidazol,
      azathioprine, formula diet and anti-TNF-alpha antibody largely reduced clinical
      activity, and resection of fistula and abscess were successful. Despite clinical 
      remission, histology showed activity in the small bowel and the colon. In March
      2001, stem cell mobilization chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide was performed. It
      induced an endoscopic remission for 9 months, which was maintained on
      azathioprine and corticosteroids. After relapse, in March 2002, high-dose
      chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and reinfusion of T-cell-depleted autologous
      peripheral CD34+ blood stem cells were performed. This led to a complete
      clinical, endoscopical and histological remission for 9 months without any
      treatment. Thereafter, endoscopy showed initial aphthous lesions with minimal
      histological signs of inflammation. The patient is asymptomatic, but low-dose
      prednisolone and methotrexate are prophylactically given. Immunoablative
      chemotherapy followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation
      may be a beneficial therapeutic option in complicated refractory CD.

TI  - Laparoscopic-assisted bowel resection offers advantages over open surgery for
      treatment of segmental Crohn's disease in children.
PG  - 963-5
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Minimally invasive approaches have been shown to decrease
      hospital length of stay (LOS), decrease postoperative pain, and speed return to
      normal activity for a number of intraabdominal procedures. In this study,
      laparoscopic (LAP)-assisted bowel resection is compared with an open technique
      for patients undergoing an initial bowel resection. METHODS: A retrospective
      review was conducted of 28 patients (12 LAP, 16 open) undergoing initial bowel
      resection for segmental Crohn's disease. RESULTS: Patients in the LAP group had
      decrease LOS (5.5 days v 11.5 days) decreased days of parenteral narcotics (3
      days v 5 days) and more rapid return to regular diet (3 days v 5 days).
      CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that the laparoscopic approach may offer advantages
      to pediatric patients undergoing an initial bowel resection for segmental Crohn's
      disease.

TI  - Consensus and controversy in the management of pediatric Crohn disease: an
      international survey.
PG  - 464-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Treatment options for patients with Crohn disease (CD) have expanded,
      but the use of some of these options in pediatric patients remains controversial.
      The authors evaluate current trends in treatment and areas of consensus or
      controversy. METHODS: An international survey of certified pediatric
      gastroenterologists was conducted using an e-mail questionnaire in an attempt to 
      evaluate management of active Crohn disease, attitudes toward four types of
      therapy, and prevalence of testing for osteopenia and 6-thioguanine levels.
      RESULTS: One hundred sixty-seven physicians from the United States, Canada,
      Western Europe, and Israel were included. The majority of North American
      physicians (71%) prefer to use conventional steroids and azathioprine (AZA)
      before nutritional therapy or budesonide for patients with mild to moderately
      active disease, versus 21% of Western Europeans (P < 0.001). Western Europeans
      prefer nutritional therapy followed by budesonide or steroids for those with mild
      or moderate disease. Only 4% of North American gastroenterologists use
      nutritional therapy frequently versus 62% of their Western European colleagues (P
      < 0.001). Infliximab was thought to be effective for steroid-unresponsive disease
      by almost all physicians surveyed, although its efficacy as a maintenance therapy
      was rated higher by North American physicians than by their Western European and 
      Israeli colleagues (P < 0.01). Bone mineral density is routinely evaluated by
      about 45% of physicians in Western Europe and North America. CONCLUSIONS:
      Attitudes toward current therapies vary significantly by region, with North
      Americans strongly favoring corticosteroids followed by immunomodulatory therapy,
      and Western Europeans favoring nutritional therapy or budesonide and the
      avoidance of conventional corticosteroids.

TI  - Supplement of a chitosan and ascorbic acid mixture for Crohn's disease: a pilot
      study.
PG  - 137-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease remains unclear, dietary 
      fat is thought to exacerbate intestinal inflammation. Chitosan is a
      water-insoluble dietary fiber, and a chitosan and ascorbic acid mixture has been 
      shown in rats to increase fecal fat excretion without affecting protein
      digestibility. However, it remains unclear whether a chitosan and ascorbic acid
      mixture is safe and effective for patients with Crohn's disease. We designed a
      pilot trial to investigate the tolerability and amount of fat excretion after the
      oral administration of a chitosan and ascorbic mixture for inactive Crohn's
      disease. METHODS: Eleven outpatients were given seven tablets daily of a chitosan
      and ascorbic mixture (chitosan was given at 1.05 g/d) for 8 wk. Patients did not 
      interrupt their respective therapies for Crohn's disease. RESULTS: The bowel
      movements of most patients increased slightly during the study. Nutritional and
      inflammatory markers in patients did not differ before and after treatment. The
      chitosan and ascorbic acid mixture significantly increased the fat concentration 
      in the feces during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that oral
      administration of a chitosan and ascorbic acid mixture in patients with Crohn's
      disease is tolerable and increases fecal fat excretion without affecting disease 
      activity.

TI  - Laparoscopic ileocecal resection in Crohn's disease: a case-matched comparison
      with open resection.
PG  - 814-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite some encouraging preliminary results, the role of
      laparosropic surgery in the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD) is a subject of
      controversy and still under evaluation. The aim of this case-matched study was to
      compare the postoperative course of laparoscopic and open ileocecal resection in 
      patients with CD in order to define the potential role of laparoscopic surgery in
      CD. METHODS: From 1998 to 2001, 24 consecutive patients with isolated Crohn's
      terminal ileitis treated by laparoscopic ileocecal resection (laparoscopy group) 
      were compared with 32 patients matched for age, gender, duration of disease,
      preoperative steroid treatment, fistulizing disease, and associated surgical
      procedure, and treated by open resection (open group). RESULTS: In the
      laparoscopy group, four procedures (17%) were converted. There were no deaths.
      The morbidity rate was 20% in the laparoscopy group and 10% in the open group
      (NS). There was no significant difference between the two groups in operating
      time, size of bowel resection and resection margin, postoperative morphine
      requirement, resumption of intestinal function, tolerance of solid diet, or
      length of hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic ileocecal resection in CD is
      safe and effective, even for fistulizing disease. There are no significant
      differences between laparoscopic and open ileocecal resection, especially in
      terms of the mortality and mortality rates. Consequently, because laparoscopic
      surgery seems to offer cosmetic advantages, it should be considered the procedure
      of choice for patients with ileocecal CD.

TI  - Review article: nutrition and adult inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 307-20
AB  - Major advances in the understanding of the aetio-pathogenesis and genetics of
      inflammatory bowel disease have been accompanied by an escalation in the
      sophistication of immunomodulatory inflammatory bowel disease therapeutics.
      However, the basic 'triple' therapy (5-aminosalicylates, corticosteroids,
      azathioprine) and nutrition have maintained their central role in the management 
      of patients with inflammatory bowel disease over recent decades. This review
      provides an overview of the supportive and therapeutic perspectives of nutrition 
      in adult inflammatory bowel disease. The objective of supportive nutrition is to 
      correct malnutrition in terms of calorie intake or specific macro- or
      micronutrients. Of particular clinical relevance is deficiency in calcium,
      vitamin D, folate, vitamin B12 and zinc. There is justifiably a growing sense of 
      unease amongst clinicians and patients with regard to the long-term use of
      corticosteroids in inflammatory bowel disease. This, rather than arguments about 
      efficacy, should be the catalyst for revisiting the use of enteral nutrition as
      primary treatment in Crohn's disease. Treatment failure is usually related to a
      failure to comply with enteral nutrition. Potential factors that militate against
      successful completion of enteral nutrition are feed palatability, inability to
      stay on a solid-free diet for weeks, social inconvenience and transient
      feed-related adverse reactions. Actions that can be taken to improve treatment
      outcome include the provision of good support from dietitians and clinicians for 
      the duration of treatment and the subsequent 'weaning' period. There is evidence 
      to support a gradual return to a normal diet through exclusion-re-introduction or
      other dietary regimen following the completion of enteral nutrition to increase
      remission rates. We also review the evidence for emerging therapies, such as
      glutamine, growth factors and short-chain fatty acids. The future may see the
      evolution of enteral nutrition into an important therapeutic strategy, and the
      design of a 'Crohn's disease-specific formulation' that is individually tailored,
      acceptable to patients, cost-effective, free from adverse side-effects and
      combines enteral nutrition with novel pre- and pro-biotics and other factors.

TI  - Dietary fat attenuates the benefits of an elemental diet in active Crohn's
      disease: a randomized, controlled trial.
PG  - 151-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although an elemental diet has been established as the primary
      treatment for patients with Crohn's disease, the influence of dietary fat on the 
      elemental diet remains unclear. We have designed the first randomized, controlled
      trial for elemental diets containing different fat percentages in patients with
      active Crohn's disease. METHODS: Each patient was randomized to receive one of
      three dose levels of fat in an elemental diet (Elental) for 4 weeks: 10 patients 
      received low fat (3.06 g/day), 10 patients received medium fat (16.56 g/day) and 
      eight patients received high fat (30.06 g/day). The additional fat was composed
      of long-chain fatty acids. All patients were evaluated using the International
      Organization of Inflammatory Bowel Disease rating, plus C-reactive protein level 
      and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which were measured at weekly intervals.
      RESULTS: Although the International Organization of Inflammatory Bowel Disease
      rating, C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate in the
      low-fat group decreased, the values in the medium- and high-fat groups fluctuated
      during the study. The remission rate after 4 weeks in each group was 80%, 40% and
      25% for patients in the low-, medium- and high-fat groups, respectively.
      CONCLUSIONS: When the fat consisted of long-chain triglycerides, a high amount of
      this fat in the elemental diet formula decreased its therapeutic effect against
      active Crohn's disease.

TI  - Laparoscopic vs conventional ileocolectomy for primary Crohn disease.
PG  - 76-9
AB  - HYPOTHESIS: Laparoscopic ileocolectomy can reduce the length of hospital stay and
      hospital charges compared with conventional surgery in the treatment of primary
      Crohn disease. DESIGN: Nonrandomized, comparative, retrospective analysis of a
      prospective database. SETTING: University hospital tertiary care center for
      inflammatory bowel disease. PATIENTS: Forty patients, 20 in the laparoscopic
      group (group A) and 20 in the conventional group (group B). INTERVENTION: From
      July 1, 1996, to June 30, 2001, we collected data on the following demographic
      clinical end points: age, sex, duration of disease, preoperative medical
      treatment, previous abdominal surgery, procedure performed, conversions to open
      surgery, operating time, number of trocars used, size of incision, blood loss,
      time to resolution of ileus, time to starting solid food diet, duration of
      hospital stay, hospital charges, morbidity, and mortality. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
      Surgical results, length of hospital stay, hospital charges, and recurrences.
      RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 34.7 years (range, 20-68 years) in
      group A vs 40.0 years (range, 18-75 years) in group B. The male-female ratio was 
      1:2 in group A vs 1:1 in group B. The morbidity was 5% in group B. There was no
      mortality. Operating time was longer in group A (mean, 145.0 minutes; range,
      45-270 minutes) compared with group B (mean, 133.5 minutes; range, 98-177
      minutes) (P =.36). Blood loss was significantly higher in group B (mean, 265.5
      mL; range, 100-400 mL) compared with group A (77.2 mL; range, 25-350 mL)
      (P<.001). Also, the size of the incision was significantly longer in group B
      (mean, 13.5 cm; range, 8-18 cm) compared with group A (mean, 5.5 cm; range, 3-12 
      cm) (P<.001). Bowel function returned more quickly in the laparoscopic group vs
      the conventional group in terms of return of bowel movements (1.70 vs 2.63 days) 
      (P<.001) and resumption of a regular diet (1.35 vs 2.73 days) (P<.001). The mean 
      length of stay was significantly shorter in the laparoscopic group (4.25 days) vs
      the conventional group (8.25 days) (P<.001). The mean hospital charges were US
      $9614 in group A vs US $17 079 in group B (P<.05). The mean follow-up was 17.2
      months in group A (range, 2.3-59.9 months) vs 18.7 months in group B (range,
      1.0-37.5 months). CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic-assisted ileocolectomy for primary
      Crohn disease of the terminal ileum and/or cecum is safe and successful in most
      cases. Laparoscopic surgery for Crohn disease should be considered as the
      preferred operative approach for primary resections.
