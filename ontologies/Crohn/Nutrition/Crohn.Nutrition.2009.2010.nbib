TI  - Ability of commonly used prediction equations to predict resting energy
      expenditure in children with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1587-93
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21518 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Paediatric onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may cause
      alterations in energy requirements and invalidate the use of standard prediction 
      equations. Our aim was to evaluate four commonly used prediction equations for
      resting energy expenditure (REE) in children with IBD. METHODS: Sixty-three
      children had repeated measurements of REE as part of a longitudinal research
      study yielding a total of 243 measurements. These were compared with predicted
      REE from Schofield, Oxford, FAO/WHO/UNU, and Harris-Benedict equations using the 
      Bland-Altman method. RESULTS: Mean (+/-SD) age of the patients was 14.2 (2.4)
      years. Mean measured REE was 1566 (336) kcal per day compared with 1491 (236),
      1441 (255), 1481 (232), and 1435 (212) kcal per day calculated from Schofield,
      Oxford, FAO/WHO/UNU, and Harris-Benedict, respectively. While the Schofield
      equation demonstrated the least difference between measured and predicted REE,
      it, along with the other equations tested, did not perform uniformly across all
      subjects, indicating greater errors at either end of the spectrum of energy
      expenditure. Smaller differences were found for all prediction equations for
      Crohn's disease compared with ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Of the commonly
      used equations, the equation of Schofield should be used in pediatric patients
      with IBD when measured values are not able to be obtained.

AB  - Thromboembolic events are one of the important extraintestinal manifestations of 
      inflammatory bowel diseases that are associated with considerable morbidity and
      mortality. Iliac vein thrombosis is rarely reported in inflammatory bowel
      diseases. A 9.5 year-old girl was presented with joint pain, nausea, vomiting and
      weight loss. She was diagnosed with Crohn's disease and right internal iliac vein
      thrombosis. With the implementation of immunosuppressive and anticoagulant
      therapies clinical picture has improved and thrombosis has resolved. Timely
      diagnosis and early treatment of extraintestinal complications of inflammatory
      bowel diseases might be lifesaving.

      therapy in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 48-53
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2010.08.007 [doi]
AB  - Thiopurines represent an effective and widely used immunosuppressant in the
      therapeutic armamentarium of inflammatory bowel disease. However up to 25% of
      patients may be unable to continue the drug due to side effects. The incidence of
      hepatotoxicity associated with thiopurine use is reported between 0% and 32%.
      Veno-occlusive disease, peliosis hepatis, perisinusoidal fibrosis and nodular
      regenerative hyperplasia have all been described with thiopurines. Recent trials 
      of 6-tioguanine, although successful in patients with allergies to azathioprine
      or mercaptopurine, have been compromised by increased hepatotoxicity, either
      veno-occlusive disease or nodular regenerative hyperplasia. We describe a report 
      of nodular regenerative hyperplasia in a Crohn's disease patient associated with 
      6-mercaptopurine therapy and have reviewed the management and the literature
      regarding this complication. Our report strengthens the importance of further
      safety studies to evaluate the etiology, prevalence, risk factors and screening
      modalities for hepatotoxicity, in particular of nodular regenerative hyperplasia,
      in patients treated with thiopurines for inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - [Enteral nutritional therapy in Crohn disease complicated with incomplete
      intestinal obstruction].
PG  - 891-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of enteral nutrition(EN) therapy for
      active Crohn disease(CD) complicated with incomplete intestinal obstruction.
      METHODS: Clinical data of 37 patients with active CD complicated with incomplete 
      intestinal obstruction treated with EN(n=37) between January 2003 and September
      2009 were retrospectively analyzed. CD activity index (CDAI) was between 150 and 
      450. The patients received total enteral nutrition (TEN) 125 kJ/kg by nasogastric
      tube or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy/jejunostomy(PEG/J) tube. Clinical
      response was defined as a decrease in CDAI>/=70 from baseline since EN therapy,
      and clinical remission was defined as CDAI<150. Nutritional status, disease
      activity index, and side effects were recorded at the 0, 4th, and 12th week after
      EN therapy. RESULTS: Stricture or stenosis location included ileum in 8 (21.6%)
      patients, ileocolon in 19(51.4%), colon in 4(10.8%), jejunoileum in 5(13.5%), and
      duodenum in 1(2.7%). At 4 weeks after EN, CDAI significantly
      decreased(112.0+/-39.6 vs.174.6+/-34.7,P<0.05). The ratio of clinical response
      was 43.2%(16/37) and clinical remission was 72.9%(27/37). At 12 weeks, CDAI was
      70.2+/-32.9, lower than that at week 4(P<0.05). The ratio of clinical response
      was 70.2%(26/37) and clinical remission was 78.4%(29/37). Other disease activity 
      indexes such as C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and
      nutritional status such as BMI, serum albumin, prealbumin, transferrin and
      hemoglobin showed similar trend. During therapy, 7 cases had progressive
      intestinal obstruction resulting in bowel resection, 11 cases had diarrhea and/or
      abdominal distention due to inadequate infusion of home EN whose symptoms were
      improved after correction by the doctor. CONCLUSIONS: EN therapy can induce
      clinical response and remission in CD complicated with incomplete intestinal
      obstruction, relieve obstruction, alleviate the inflammatory response which plays
      positive role in the treatment of CD.

AB  - Annual costs paid by families for intravenous infusion of home parenteral
      nutrition (HPN) health insurance premiums, deductibles, co-payments for health
      services, and the wide range of out-of-pocket home health care expenses are
      significant. The costs of managing complex chronic care at home cannot be
      completely understood until all out-of-pocket costs have been defined, described,
      and tabulated. Non-reimbursed and out-of-pocket costs paid by families over years
      for complex chronic care negatively impact the financial stability of families.
      National health care reform must take into account the long-term financial
      burdens of families caring for those with complex home care. Any changes that may
      increase the out-of-pocket costs or health insurance costs to these families can 
      also have a negative long-term impact on society when greater numbers of patients
      declare bankruptcy or qualify for medical disability.

TI  - Teduglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-2 analog for the treatment of
      gastrointestinal diseases, including short bowel syndrome.
PG  - 798-809
AB  - Glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) is a potent intestinotrophic growth factor with
      therapeutic potential for the prevention or treatment of an expanding number of
      gastrointestinal diseases, including short bowel syndrome (SBS). Teduglutide,
      being developed by NPS Allelix and licensee Nycomed, is a protease-resistant
      analog of GLP-2 for the potential treatment of gastrointestinal disease.
      Teduglutide has prolonged biological activity compared with native GLP-2, and
      preclinical studies demonstrated significant intestinotrophic activity in models 
      of SBS, experimental colitis and chemotherapy-induced intestinal mucositis.
      Patients with SBS rely on parenteral nutrition (PN) following bowel resection,
      and in a phase III clinical trial with teduglutide, > 20% reduction in PN was
      observed in patients with SBS receiving teduglutide. A phase II clinical trial
      for teduglutide in Crohn's disease observed remission rates of 55.6% in patients.
      At the time of publication, phase III clinical trials for SBS were ongoing, as
      were preclinical studies for chemotherapy-induced mucositis and pediatric
      indications. Teduglutide represents a novel, efficacious drug capable of
      increasing intestinal growth and improving intestinal function, and may change
      clinical management of intestinal disease and damage.

AB  - Although providing necessary information to patients with Crohn disease (CD) can 
      influence their quality of life, there has been no study regarding the
      information provided by healthcare providers to CD patients. The aim of our study
      was to describe the contents of brochures given to CD patients in Japanese
      hospitals. These brochures were compared with ones used in the United States,
      Canada, and the United Kingdom. Forty-nine members of the research group on
      inflammatory bowel disease in Japan were asked to answer a questionnaire
      regarding educational brochures for CD patients. We obtained 15 Japanese and
      three foreign brochures and conducted content analyses for seven global
      brochures. We received 34 replies. Only 15 (44%) of 34 hospitals gave the
      brochures to all newly diagnosed CD patients. In the Japanese brochures, a lot of
      content was devoted to nutrition therapy and self-management in terms of diet. On
      the contrary, foreign brochures devoted more content to symptoms and drug
      therapy. The existing approaches for providing information in Japanese hospitals 
      were unsatisfactory. Furthermore, Japanese educational brochures for CD patients 
      emphasized nutritional therapy and dietary restriction. This reflected the
      differences in treatment strategies among countries.

TI  - Current therapeutic approaches in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 3668-83
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory disorder
      of the gastrointestinal tract and is broadly classified into Crohn's disease (CD)
      and ulcerative colitis (UC). In the last decade, our understanding of the
      etiology and pathogenesis of this group of disorders has been improved. More
      specifically, recent development of biologics and use of immunomodulator agents
      in IBD have made it possible to robustly control mucosal inflammation and heal
      mucosal ulcerations and thus provide an opportunity to potentially modify disease
      course and prevent complications and future surgery. However, unfortunately we
      have not identified reliable, sensitive and specific markers to predict disease
      course and to identify those patients with aggressive and progressive course that
      would benefit from early use of biologics to prevent future complication and
      surgery. Thus, optimal medical management of IBD has remained multifaceted and
      individualized. Our primary therapeutic goals have remained unchanged and are to:
      [1] improve patient quality of life by treating flare ups [induction of
      remission], maintaining remission, and treating symptoms like diarrhea; [2]
      predict and prevent/treat complication; [3] prevent/treat nutritional deficiency 
      and maintain optimal nutrition, [4] provide appropriate psychosocial support, and
      of course [5] attempt to modify disease course in those with aggressive disease. 
      We can achieve these goals by appropriate use of therapeutic agents that include 
      5-aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, antibiotics,
      nutritional support, and the biologic agents. Information from well designed
      double blind placebo controlled trials combined with knowledge of the potential
      impact of patient and disease characteristics on disease course which can assist 
      us to individualized treatment plan will be the guide for us to appropriately use
      these therapeutic agents. For example, age of the onset of the disease, patient
      gender and race, mode of the disease presentation, disease location,
      disease-associated complications such as perianal disease/fistula, and serology
      and genetic markers can all help to individualize disease treatment. These
      factors can help to determine whether one should start with
      5-ASA/antibiotic/steroid [step-up where there is no risk factors for aggressive
      disease course] or whether one should initiate biologic therapy at diagnosis
      [top-down approach], and whether it is most advisable to use monotherapy with
      biologic treatment [e.g. in young, Caucasian male or elderly] or use a
      combination therapy with a biologic and an immunomodulator. Ongoing research
      promises, in a near future, development of more robust set of markers to be able 
      to model disease behavior to more accurately predict disease course and thus
      decide on therapeutic approach with most appropriate efficacy/risk ratio for a
      given patient. Furthermore, current basic laboratory research has provided a
      large number of potential therapeutic targets to treat IBD with new promising
      highly specific and targeted agents.

AB  - Gastrointestinal symptoms occurring in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) can be 
      related to disease activity or to intercurrent infection. Absence of appropriate 
      stool work-up can lead to misdiagnosis and wrong treatment. We report here two
      cases of acute cryptosporidiosis in patients with CD. This microorganism can
      trigger IBD flare or cause severe infections in immunocompromised host. Adding
      specific search for oocysts of Cryptosporidium parvum using the Ziehl-Neelsen
      technique to the microbiologic work-up from stools in patients with Crohn's
      disease seeking medical intervention for sudden exacerbation of digestive
      symptoms seems to be recommended.

TI  - Long-term efficacy of adalimumab in paediatric Crohn's disease patients naive to 
      other anti-TNF therapies.
PG  - 594-8
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2010.04.002 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Adalimumab is a fully-humanized anti-TNF a antibody that has showed
      its efficacy in Crohn's disease (CD) adult patients. Its less immunogenic
      composition seems to be an advantage compared to previous anti-TNF alpha, mainly 
      infliximab. Good response to adalimumab has been reported in patients naive to
      infliximab, in those in whom infliximab has shown no efficacy and in those
      intolerant or who have lost previous response to it. Adalimumab has shown also
      its efficacy as a second-line anti-TNF alpha in small series of paediatric CD but
      data regarding its use in children naive to infliximab are scarce. AIM: To report
      our experience with adalimumab as first line anti-TNF alpha treatment in
      paediatric CD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four CD paediatric patients (2 boys)
      previously naive to infliximab have received adalimumab. Mean age at diagnosis:
      13 years, 4 months. Adalimumab was initiated in our patients soon after diagnosis
      (mean time from diagnosis: 8.5 months, range: 1 month 15 days-14 months) at
      decreasing loading doses (160 mg and 80 mg two weeks after) and then 40 mg
      subsequently every two weeks. RESULTS: The four patients entered in remission
      after the first dose of adalimumab (mean previous PCDAI: 35, mean PCDAI after
      first dose: 3.6). No adverse effects were registered. Azathioprine was stopped
      after 4 months of combination therapy, without loss of efficacy or adverse
      reactions attributable to immunogenicity. All the 4 patients have remained in
      remission on adalimumab monotherapy for a mean follow-up of 17 months (range 9-20
      months). CONCLUSION: Adalimumab has shown its efficacy in our paediatric CD
      patients naive to other anti-TNF alpha drugs. Early introduction of anti-TNF
      alpha antibodies in these patients could help to a better control of the disease.
      Its less immunogenicity and the possibility of a home-based administration are
      advantages when compared to other parenteral anti-TNF treatments. Change to
      monotherapy after prior successful combination therapy with azathioprine and
      adalimumab is a safe strategy that can help to minimize possible risks of
      intensive immunomodulation.

AB  - Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare, potentially fatal, severe
      condition of hyperinflammation caused by the uncontrolled proliferation of
      activated lymphocytes and histiocytes secreting high amounts of inflammatory
      cytokines. Here we report a fatal hemophagocytic syndrome in a 11-year-old boy
      with a diagnosis of both Crohn's disease receiving immunosuppressive therapy and 
      familial Mediterranean fever. It is important to evaluate the patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease receiving immunosuppressive therapy presenting with
      unexplained fever, cytopenia, progression of organomegaly and biochemical changes
      for the investigation of HLH for diagnosis and treatment.

PG  - 106-9
LID - 10.1016/j.crohns.2009.08.004 [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease is extremely rare in infancy and can be present in severe forms. 
      Infants with Crohn's disease might require intensive immunosuppressive therapy.
      Infliximab is a chimeric mouse/human monoclonal IgG1 antibody against tumor
      necrosis factor-alpha, and completely neutralizes its biologic activity. Though
      widely used in the treatment of pediatric Crohn's disease, there are few data
      regarding its applicability in infancy. We therefore report herein our
      experiences with infliximab therapy in two infantile patients with Crohn's
      disease who were resistant to conventional therapies; one patient showed a
      partial response while there was no response in the second. We were unable to
      achieve satisfactory results from infliximab therapy. It remains to be determined
      whether inflammatory bowel disease starting in infancy represents a separate
      pathogenetic subgroup and whether the inflammatory bowel disease diagnosis should
      follow the exclusion of an immunodeficiency state. Studies in larger series are
      needed to further clarify the efficacy, safety and timing of infliximab therapy
      for infantile Crohn's disease patients.

LID - 10.1542/peds.2010-2548 [doi]
AB  - This clinical report reviews the currently known health benefits of probiotic and
      prebiotic products, including those added to commercially available infant
      formula and other food products for use in children. Probiotics are supplements
      or foods that contain viable microorganisms that cause alterations of the
      microflora of the host. Use of probiotics has been shown to be modestly effective
      in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in (1) treating acute viral gastroenteritis 
      in healthy children; and (2) preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea in healthy
      children. There is some evidence that probiotics prevent necrotizing
      enterocolitis in very low birth weight infants (birth weight between 1000 and
      1500 g), but more studies are needed. The results of RCTs in which probiotics
      were used to treat childhood Helicobacter pylori gastritis, irritable bowel
      syndrome, chronic ulcerative colitis, and infantile colic, as well as in
      preventing childhood atopy, although encouraging, are preliminary and require
      further confirmation. Probiotics have not been proven to be beneficial in
      treating or preventing human cancers or in treating children with Crohn disease. 
      There are also safety concerns with the use of probiotics in infants and children
      who are immunocompromised, chronically debilitated, or seriously ill with
      indwelling medical devices. Prebiotics are supplements or foods that contain a
      nondigestible food ingredient that selectively stimulates the favorable growth
      and/or activity of indigenous probiotic bacteria. Human milk contains substantial
      quantities of prebiotics. There is a paucity of RCTs examining prebiotics in
      children, although there may be some long-term benefit of prebiotics for the
      prevention of atopic eczema and common infections in healthy infants.
      Confirmatory well-designed clinical research studies are necessary.

TI  - Surgical treatment of chronic inflammatory bowel disease in children.
PG  - 385-90
LID - 10.1007/s00383-010-2809-9 [doi]
AB  - Surgery for chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasingly often
      necessary in children. This study aimed at assessing the results of these
      operations in order to facilitate adequate preoperative counseling. We reviewed
      patients treated from 1992 to 2009. The operations, complications and functional 
      outcome were recorded. For those with preserved rectal defecation, continence
      (Koivusalo score) and quality of life (standardized questionnaire) were assessed 
      in the long term. Eighty five of 192 patients had Crohn disease (CD), 107 of 192 
      had ulcerative colitis (UC), and 3 of 192 had indeterminate colitis (IC). 12 of
      85 CD patients (15%) aged 14 (12-19) years required 13 resections, 1
      stricturoplasty, 1 transplantation and 6 other operations including 3 permanent
      enterostomies for anorectal involvement. Removal of the involved bowel led to
      significant improvement of nutritional status, growth and quality of life. The
      transplanted patient had a striking recovery but eventually died 1 year later of 
      unrelated complications. 29 of 107 UC patients (26%) aged 11 (2-15) years
      required 87 operations. Nine had emergency colectomy for toxic megacolon (3, one 
      death) or severe hemorrhage (6). 28 had restorative proctocolectomy and
      ileoanostomy (RPCIA) without (16) or with (12) J-pouch under protective
      ileostomy. Complications were frequent (40%). Permanent ileostomy was required in
      five children (17%). Twelve months postoperatively, RPCIA patients had 6.5 (2-13)
      stools/day; all were continent during daytime, and 25% have nocturnal leaks. Mean
      Koivusalo score (5-12) was 8.8 +/- 2. Quality of life was good in all. All
      attended normal school and 7 the university, 4 work and 60% of those older than
      18 years have sexual partners. Three of 107 children treated as UC with RPCIA had
      ultimately IC (3%) and were permanently diverted. The nature of IBD involves
      frustrating surgery. However, it may change life for CD patients and provide a
      reasonably good quality of life for UC after the first year. Pediatric surgeons
      should be able to provide adequate preoperative counseling to patients and
      families.

TI  - Vitamin D supplementation in adults - guidelines.
PG  - 723-9
AB  - Vitamin D is necessary in maintaining appropriate calcium and phosphate
      homeostasis in the body (classical function) and ensuring appropriate functioning
      of many tissues, organs and cells, unrelated to mineral economy (non-classical
      function). Vitamin D deficiency in adults may cause osteomalacia, increase
      fracture risk in osteoporosis, induce cardiovascular diseases, diabetes type 1
      and 2, multiple sclerosis, Lesniowski-Crohn disease, and cancer, including colon,
      breast, and prostate cancer. Possible causes of vitamin D deficiency in a healthy
      population include decreased cutaneous synthesis and an inadequate intake of
      vitamin D, both in food and in supplements. Vitamin D deficiency level (25(OH) D.
      < 20 ng/mL), is fairly widespread, being found in a substantial percentage of
      healthy subjects around the world, regardless of race, gender and age. Daily
      vitamin D dose, as determined by the Food and Nutrition Board in 1997, is now
      rather insufficient, the biggest problem being associated with maximal vitamin D 
      levels (50 mug/day) in actually available food supplements. Nowadays, it is
      recommended that adults need a minimum of 800-1,000 U/day when their exposure to 
      the sun is inadequate (in Poland from October to April). This dosage should be
      provided to all subjects who avoid sunlight, as well as to those aged over 65
      because of their slower skin synthesis of vitamin D and for its proven
      anti-fracture and anti-fall effects.

TI  - Advances in the understanding of mineral and bone metabolism in inflammatory
      bowel diseases.
PG  - G191-201
LID - 10.1152/ajpgi.00496.2010 [doi]
AB  - Chronic inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) affect 
      bone metabolism and are frequently associated with the presence of osteopenia,
      osteoporosis, and increased risk of fractures. Although several mechanisms may
      contribute to skeletal abnormalities in IBD patients, inflammation and
      inflammatory mediators such as TNF, IL-1beta, and IL-6 may be the most critical. 
      It is not clear whether the changes in bone metabolism leading to decreased
      mineral density are the result of decreased bone formation, increased bone
      resorption, or both, with varying results reported in experimental models of IBD 
      and in pediatric and adult IBD patients. New data, including our own, challenge
      the conventional views, and contributes to the unraveling of an increasingly
      complex network of interactions leading to the inflammation-associated bone loss.
      Since nutritional interventions (dietary calcium and vitamin D supplementation)
      are of limited efficacy in IBD patients, understanding the pathophysiology of
      osteopenia and osteoporosis in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis is critical
      for the correct choice of available treatments or the development of new targeted
      therapies. In this review, we discuss current concepts explaining the effects of 
      inflammation, inflammatory mediators and their signaling effectors on calcium and
      phosphate homeostasis, osteoblast and osteoclast function, and the potential
      limitations of vitamin D used as an immunomodulator and anabolic hormone in IBD.

AB  - Normal functioning of the human body requires a balance between nutritional
      intake and metabolism, and imbalances manifest as nutritional deficiencies or
      excess. Nutritional deficiency states are associated with social factors (war,
      poverty, famine, and food fads), medical illnesses with malabsorption (such as
      Crohn disease, cystic fibrosis, and after bariatric surgery), psychiatric
      illnesses (eating disorders, autism, alcoholism), and medications. Nutritional
      excess states result from inadvertent or intentional excessive intake. Cutaneous 
      manifestations of nutritional imbalance can herald other systemic manifestations.
      This contribution discusses nutritional deficiency and excess syndromes with
      cutaneous manifestations of particular interest to clinical dermatologists.

      case-control study.
PG  - 2099-108
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21286 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of complementary and alternative medicine in inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) has been extensively studied. However, the use of probiotics 
      and prebiotics is poorly documented, despite evidence of efficacy of particular
      probiotic strains in specific forms of IBD. METHODS: A case-control study
      comprising interviewer-administered questionnaires was conducted in IBD patients 
      and healthy controls. Data regarding use and knowledge of probiotics and
      prebiotics, demographic, and clinical information were collected. RESULTS: In
      total, 334 participants (234 IBD, 100 controls) were interviewed. Significantly
      more IBD patients than controls had ever used probiotics to manage their health
      (Crohn's disease [CD] 43%, ulcerative colitis [UC] 51%, controls 21%, P < 0.001).
      Prebiotic use was negligible. On logistic regression analysis, having UC (odds
      ratio [OR] 4.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.27-8.12) or CD (OR 3.05, 95% CI
      1.66-5.60) were the strongest predictors of probiotic use. Within IBD patients
      the strongest predictor of probiotic use was current steroid use (OR 2.4, 95% CI 
      1.11-5.18). IBD patients had greater probiotic knowledge scores than controls (P 
      = 0.003), although 20% of IBD probiotic users could not provide a definition of a
      probiotic. Less than half of IBD probiotic users discussed probiotic use with
      healthcare professionals, with commercial advertising being the primary source of
      information. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD use probiotics to manage their health
      but frequently choose strains without evidence of efficacy in IBD. Patients rely 
      on nonclinical sources of information and often do not disclose probiotic use to 
      healthcare professionals. Conventional healthcare providers should inquire about 
      probiotic use among their patients and offer evidence-based advice.

AB  - Biological therapies are an important step in the management of Inflammatory
      Bowel Diseases. In consideration of high cost and safety issues there is the need
      to have clear recommendations for their use. Despite the American
      Gastroenterological Association and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation
      have published exhaustive Inflammatory Bowel Disease guidelines, national
      guidelines may be necessary as cultural values, economical and legal issues may
      differ between countries. For these reasons the Italian Society of
      Gastroenterology and the Italian Group for the study of Inflammatory Bowel
      Disease have decided to elaborate the Italian guidelines on the use of biologics 
      in Inflammatory Bowel Disease. The following items have been chosen: definitions 
      of active, inactive, steroid dependent and resistant disease; measures of
      activity; anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha therapy use in active steroid
      dependent and refractory luminal Crohn's Disease, in fistulising Crohn's Disease,
      in steroid dependent and resistant active Ulcerative Colitis; risk of cancer;
      risk of infections during anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha therapy; special
      situations. These guidelines are based on evidence from relevant medical
      literature and clinical experience of a national working group.

TI  - Bones in pediatric Crohn's disease: a review of fracture risk in children and
      adults.
PG  - 1223-8
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21471 [doi]
AB  - There is evidence to suggest that the inflammation associated with Crohn's
      disease (CD) impacts the bone health of patients, predisposing them to early
      onset osteoporosis and increasing their risk of fracture. Fractures have been
      documented in patients with CD, with a high proportion of these being found
      during young adulthood, which suggests that these patients are not simply
      fracturing as a result of the normal aging process but rather due to the presence
      of CD. In population terms, patients with CD have increased risk of fracture
      compared with the general population. Studies in children suggest that,
      irrespective of time on corticosteroid therapy, the underlying systemic
      inflammation associated with CD is an independent detrimental influence on the
      bone health of children with CD. This poses the question as to whether the onset 
      of disease in childhood predisposes the individual to increased risk of future
      fractures later in life, as a result of decreased peak bone mass during the
      growing years. It is generally believed that dual energy x-ray
      absorptiometry-assessed areal bone mineral density is a good indicator of
      fracture risk; however, several studies have shown this may not be the case. New 
      research, utilizing peripheral quantitative computed tomography, which provides a
      true volumetric assessment of bone, suggests altered bone geometry in patients
      with CD, which poses a structural threat by being more brittle and susceptible to
      damage accumulation.

TI  - Immunogenecity of hepatitis A vaccine in pediatric patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease.
PG  - 1117-24
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21465 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are only a few studies on immune response to routine
      vaccinations in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), despite a strong 
      need for this kind of study. The aim of the study was to evaluate the
      immunogenicity of an inactivated hepatitis A vaccine (HAV) in IBD pediatric
      patients compared with healthy controls. METHODS: This was an open, prospective, 
      and controlled study on anti-HAV-negative children and adolescents age 2-18 years
      with IBD. HAV using 720 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) units were
      administered at 0 months and at 6-12 months. Seroconversion and geometric mean
      titers were measured after each vaccine dose. The evidence of local and systemic 
      adverse effects for 3 days after the first and second dose of vaccine was
      registered. RESULTS: A total of 134 subjects (66 patients and 68 controls)
      completed the whole study course consisting of two doses of vaccine and six serum
      samples. There was no significant difference in the rate of seroconversion
      between IBD patients and controls when measured after the second dose of vaccine 
      (97% versus 100%, P = 0.2407), but the rate was significantly lower in the IBD
      group when measured after the first dose (39% versus 64%, P = 0.00001). The mean 
      geometric titers were statistically significantly lower in the IBD group than in 
      the control group at all of the measured timepoints. There were no serious
      adverse events related to HAV during the study. CONCLUSIONS: HAV is both
      immunogenic and safe in pediatric patients with IBD.

TI  - Body composition in childhood inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 112-5
LID - 10.1016/j.clnu.2010.07.014 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is known about the impact of disease and treatment on
      the pattern of growth in children with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).
      Significant deficits in height and weight in children with Crohn's disease have
      been reported but changes in fat and fat free mass are less well defined. This
      study aims to describe the height, weight and body composition of a cohort of
      children with IBD. METHODS: Height, weight, skinfold thicknesses and
      bioelectrical impedance analysis was performed. Disease activity was assessed
      with clinical scoring systems. RESULTS: 55 children, median age 13.7 years (range
      6.5-17.7) were studied. Median (25th, 75th percentile) Standard Deviation Score
      for BMI, Height and Weight were - 0.3 (- 0.97, 0.65), - 0.56 (- 1.42, 0.06), -
      0.62 (- 1.43, 0.19). In Crohn's disease, using multiple regression analysis
      disease activity measured by PCDAI was significantly inversely related to fat
      free mass (beta - 0.2, 95% CI -0.17, -0.03, p 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Children with 
      IBD were both under and overweight. Nutritional deficits were more common in
      Crohn's disease. Fat free mass was related to disease activity in children with
      Crohn's disease regardless of changes in weight. Weight or BMI may mask deficits 
      in lean tissue in the presence of normal or increased proportions of body fat.

TI  - The prevalence of malnutrition and the evolution of nutritional status in
      patients with moderate to severe forms of Crohn's disease treated with
      Infliximab.
PG  - 86-91
LID - 10.1016/j.clnu.2010.07.019 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Malnutrition is variably encountered in adult patients with
      Crohn's disease. We evaluated the nutritional status at the beginning and during 
      Infliximab treatment in patients with Crohn's disease. METHODS: Patients with
      moderate/severe flares of disease treated with Infliximab for induction and
      maintenance of remission were included in a prospective observational study. Body
      Mass Index and Nutritional Risk Index were calculated in each patient at 0, 6
      weeks and than every 8 weeks for one year. RESULTS: From 30 patients treated with
      Infliximab 59.3% had low BMI, 35.7% being undernourished. The severity of Crohn's
      disease did not correlate with low BMI but did correlate with Nutritional Risk
      Index (p = 0.001). In all patients that responded to Infliximab treatment
      progressive weight gain was observed, all but one patient reaching normal BMI
      after one year. Mean weight gain was significantly more elevated (p = 0.001) and 
      time needed to reach normal BMI was longer in the undernutrition group (p =
      0.01). Clinical remission was the principal factor associated with weight gain (p
      = 0.001), while there was no influence of endoscopic remission on nutritional
      status. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with moderate/severe forms of Crohn's disease
      malnutrition is frequently encountered. Induction and maintenance treatment with 
      Infliximab determines weight gain and corrects malnutrition in all patients with 
      clinical remission.

AB  - Crohn disease (CD) is a chronic bowel disorder that may affect many other organs 
      such as the eyes, hepatobiliary system, skin, and joints. Pulmonary involvement
      in association with CD is a classic but uncommon manifestation. It can be
      primitive with granulomas or secondary to treatments. We report on the case of a 
      teenager in whom the onset of CD was dominated by respiratory symptoms. Because
      of this presentation, we also suspected opportunistic infections such as
      tuberculosis and other granulomatous pulmonary diseases such as sarcoidosis or
      hypersensitivity pneumonitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease
      with relapse and remission. CD patients are admitted to hospital when bowel
      inflammation flares up severely, which lowers their quality of life. Enteral
      nutrition (EN) with an elemental diet plays an important role in the treatment
      for CD patients in Japan, because of its few adverse effects, and it is thought
      to be effective in maintaining remission. We investigated the effectiveness of EN
      with an elemental diet with regard to the avoidance of hospitalization. METHODS: 
      A total of 268 patients with CD who visited hospital from 2003-2008 were
      enrolled. The relationship between the caloric content of an elemental diet and
      hospitalization as an end-point was examined retrospectively using Cox regression
      analysis. Cumulative non-hospitalization rates were calculated by the
      Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Of the 268 patients, 155 received an elemental diet
      providing 900 kcal/day or more. Among 237 patients with ileal involvement, 135
      patients receiving an elemental diet providing 900 kcal/day or more showed a
      statistically significant improvement in cumulative non-hospitalization rate.
      Among 31 patients without ileal involvement, in contrast, the cumulative
      non-hospitalization rate did not differ among those receiving an elemental diet
      of less or more than 900 kcal/day. CONCLUSION: The use of an elemental diet of
      900 kcal/day may be effective in avoiding hospitalization in CD patients with
      ileal lesions. This diet may be useful in improving the long-term convalescence
      of these patients.

TI  - Nutritional status in patients with active inflammatory bowel disease: prevalence
      of malnutrition and methods for routine nutritional assessment.
PG  - 315-9
LID - 10.1016/j.ejim.2010.04.012 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Malnutrition is a common feature of inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). There are numerous methods for the assessment of nutritional
      status, but the gold standard has not yet been established. The aims of the study
      were to estimate the prevalence of undernutrition and to evaluate methods for
      routine nutritional assessment of active IBD patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS:
      Twenty-three patients with active Crohn disease, 53 patients with active
      ulcerative colitis and 30 controls were included in the study. The nutritional
      status was assessed by extensive anthropometric measurements, percentage of
      weight loss in the past 1-6 months and biochemical markers of nutrition. RESULTS:
      All investigated nutritional parameters were significantly different in IBD
      patients compared to control subjects, except MCV, tryglicerides and serum total 
      protein level. Serum albumin level and body mass index (BMI) were the most
      predictive parameters of malnutrition. According to different assessment methods 
      the prevalence of undernutrition and severe undernutrition in patients with
      active IBD were 25.0%-69.7% and 1.3%-31.6%, respectively, while in the control
      subjects no abnormalities have been detected. There was no statistically
      significant difference of nutritional parameters between UC and CD patients
      except lower mid-arm muscle circumference in UC group. CONCLUSIONS: Malnutrition 
      is common in IBD patients. BMI and serum albumin are simple and convenient
      methods for the assessment of the nutritional status in IBD patients. Further
      studies with larger group of patients are necessary to elucidate the prevalence
      of malnutrition and the most accurate assessment methods in IBD patients.

PG  - 336-40
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181d94f63 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Total enteral nutrition (TEN) is frequently used as monotherapy in
      children with Crohn disease to prevent steroid toxicity. Liver disease is a known
      complication in inflammatory bowel disease, and liver enzymes are regularly
      obtained in these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective follow-up of liver 
      enzymes was performed in 11 new consecutive patients ages 7.6 to 17.1 years who
      were primarily treated with TEN for 6 weeks. Liver enzymes were measured before
      starting TEN and after 3, 6, and 12 weeks. RESULTS: At the beginning of TEN, the 
      mean aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) was 18.4 U/L and the mean alanine
      aminotransferase (ALAT) 17.1 U/L. The mean ASAT and ALAT were 202.0 U/L and 269.0
      U/L after 3 weeks and 109.6 U/L and 180.9 U/L at 6 weeks. After 12 weeks values
      decreased to 22.8 U/L (ASAT) and 20.9 U/L (ALAT). Overall, 9 of 11 patients had
      transient elevated ASAT and 10 patients showed elevated ALAT. Gamma-glutamyl
      transpeptidase was slightly elevated in 3 patients during therapy, but alkaline
      phosphatase and bilirubin showed no changes. None of the patients developed liver
      disease during follow-up, and prolonged clinical remission was achieved in 9
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that TEN can be associated with transient
      hypertransaminasemia without evidence of liver disease. We hypothesise that
      insulin resistance in patients with Crohn disease in combination with standard
      TEN formulae can result in transient hepatic steatosis causing the
      hypertransaminasemia. For the clinician it is important to be aware of this
      benign TEN-associated condition to prevent unnecessary investigations.

AB  - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are lifelong conditions with particular
      effects upon nutrition, especially in children and adolescents. Various therapies
      are available for these conditions but there remains no cure. Over the last
      decades, exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) has been demonstrated to have efficacy
      in the induction of remission, along with numerous other nutritional and
      inflammatory benefits. This article reviews the benefits and outcomes associated 
      with EEN in Crohn's disease. The potential mechanisms of this therapy are
      highlighted, along with factors that are barriers to the wider use of EEN.

PG  - 573-83

AB  - The field of nutrigenomics recognizes gene-diet interactions, with regard to both
      the impact of genetic variation on nutrient requirements, and conversely nutrient
      regulation of the expression of genes. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are
      inflammatory bowel diseases for which twin studies reveal genetic susceptibility 
      that is impacted by diet and environment. Apparently contradictory data on the
      role of diet in inflammatory bowel disease would be entirely explainable if
      genetic variability determined dietary requirements and intolerances. Considering
      Crohn's disease, we recognize three major classes of genes. The first of these
      involves bacterial recognition through pattern recognition receptors and
      autophagy genes, while the second act through secondary immune response, and the 
      third concern epithelial barrier integrity. Despite genetic overlap with CD, the 
      first two groups of genes appear to be less important in ulcerative colitis,
      while other genes, particularly those involved in barrier function, gain
      prominence. Case-control studies suggest that these different genetic groups
      reflect distinct dietary requirements. Such studies suggest nutrigenomic
      approaches to maintaining disease remission at present, and preventing disease
      development in the future.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Concomitant use of immunosuppressants (IS) with scheduled
      infliximab (IFX) maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative
      colitis (UC) is debated. The aim of this study was to assess whether IS
      co-treatment is useful in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on
      scheduled IFX infusions. METHODS: 121 consecutive patients with IBD (23 UC, 98
      CD) treated by IFX and who received at least 6 months of IS co-treatment
      (azathioprine (AZA) or methotrexate (MTX)) were studied. In each patient, the IFX
      treatment duration was divided into semesters which were independently analysed
      regarding IBD activity. RESULTS: Semesters with IS (n=265) and without IS (n=319)
      were analysed. IBD flares, perianal complications and switch to adalimumab were
      less frequently observed in semesters with IS than in those without IS
      (respectively: 19.3% vs 32.0%, p=0.003; 4.1% vs 11.8%, p=0.03; 1.1% vs 5.3%,
      p=0.006). Maximal C-reactive protein (CRP) level and IFX dose/kg observed during 
      the semesters were lower in semesters with IS. Within semesters with IS, IBD
      flares and perianal complications were less frequently observed in semesters with
      AZA than in those with MTX. In multivariate analysis, IS co-treatment was
      associated with a decreased risk of IBD flare (OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.79)
      CONCLUSION: In patients with IBD receiving IFX maintenance therapy, IS
      co-treatment is associated with reduced IBD activity, IFX dose and switch to
      adalimumab. In this setting, co-treatment with AZA seems to be more effective
      than co-treatment with MTX. Benefit of such a combination treatment has to be
      balanced with potential risks, notably infections and cancers.

TI  - Entecavir for hepatitis B virus flare treatment in patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 242-5
AB  - Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global health problem and has an
      increased prevalence in patients with Crohn's disease due to their increased
      requirement for high-risk procedures. A balance between viral replication and
      host immune response exists and drugs such as the immunosuppressive agents used
      to treat Crohn's disease may alter this balance. These may result in a hepatic
      flare, which manifests as high viremia, increased transaminase levels, and
      hepatic decompensation. The present study describes two cases of hepatic flare
      thought to be caused by treatment of acute Crohn's disease with systemic
      corticosteroids and/or azathioprine. Both patients presented with raised
      transaminase and gamma glutamyl transferase levels and viremia. One patient
      experienced a decrease in hepatic function, as evidenced by a reduced serum
      albumin (2.5g/ dL) and jaundice (total bilirubin 5.2 mg/dL), and hepatic
      decompensation, with ascites. Both patients were treated with the nucleoside
      analogue entecavir 0.5 mg/day and experienced reductions in HBV-DNA and hepatic
      enzyme levels within 4-7 days. The patient with decompensation received diuretic 
      therapy and parenteral nutrition to support hepatic function and a clinical
      improvement was seen. Both patients were discharged 2 weeks after admission and, 
      during follow-up, HBV-DNA levels became negative after 1 and 5 months,
      respectively. No adverse events were reported in either patient. To the best of
      our knowledge, this is the first documented report of treatment of HBV flare with
      entecavir in patients co-affected with Crohn's disease.

TI  - Prevalence and incidence rates of Crohn's disease in mainland China: a
      meta-analysis of 55 years of research.
PG  - 161-6
LID - 10.1111/j.1751-2980.2010.00431.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To better understand the occurrence of Crohn's disease in mainland
      China and to give an updated overview of the current status of the disease.
      METHODS: We previously performed a computer-based literature search using 50
      years of records from the Chinese Database of Biology and Medicine (1979 to
      2002), combined with a manual year-by-year search of the literature from 1950 to 
      1978. Using a similar method, descriptive epidemiological data of the last 5
      years (2003 to September 2007) were collected, pooled with our previous data and 
      re-analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 3618 cases of Crohn's disease since 1950 have
      been reported from 29 provinces and cities in mainland China, comprising 2112
      male and 1506 female patients, with a male predominance of 1.40:1. More than 75
      percent of the patients were aged from 20 to 50 years old, with a mean age of
      36.9 +/- 4.4 (1- 84) years. The extrapolated disease incidence and prevalence
      rates are 0.848/10(5) and 2.29/10(5) person/year, respectively. CONCLUSION: The
      incidence and prevalence rates of Crohn's disease have been increasing rapidly,
      and the disease is no longer uncommon in China, but these rates are still lower
      than those in developed countries and other Asian countries. An underestimation
      may occur because patients who were misdiagnosed or did not seek medical advice
      could not be included in the study. A future population-based survey is
      warranted.

LID - 10.1097/MOG.0b013e328338f724 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recurrence of Crohn's disease following surgical resection is 
      common, but the optimal strategy to assess, prevent, and treat postoperative
      recurrence remains unclear. Recent developments in the prevention and management 
      of postoperative recurrence have provided additional information. RECENT
      FINDINGS: Predictors of Crohn's disease recurrence after surgery include
      cigarette smoking, disease behavior, number of prior resections, family history, 
      anastomotic type, and time to first surgery. Only penetrating disease behavior
      and continued cigarette smoking after surgery remain clear predictors of
      postoperative Crohn's disease recurrence. Ileocolonoscopy is the only modality to
      detect mucosal recurrence after surgery; however, surrogate markers of
      inflammation, specifically stool lactoferrin and calprotectin as well as small
      intestine contrast ultrasound, are promising. Due to the high rate of surgery for
      the treatment of complications of Crohn's disease, prevention of postoperative
      disease has received considerable attention. Recent studies of
      azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine, nitroimidazole antibiotics, and infliximab have
      broadened the spectrum of medication options postoperatively. SUMMARY: Smoking
      cessation and ileocolonoscopy for early detection of Crohn's disease recurrence
      should be part of any postoperative management strategy. The selection of
      medication and optimal time to initiate treatment after surgery is less certain. 
      Postoperative immunomodulators and antitumor necrosis factor agents may prevent
      Crohn's disease in those at high risk for recurrence. Treatment of patients by
      predictors of recurrence and personalization of management based on
      genotypes/phenotypes will be the focus of future study.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of endoscopic balloon dilation of symptomatic intestinal
      Crohn's disease strictures.
PG  - 121-5
LID - 10.1016/j.dld.2010.05.001 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To evaluate prospectively the clinical efficacy and safety of endoscopic
      hydrostatic balloon dilation in a consecutive cohort of symptomatic intestinal
      Crohn's disease strictures. METHODS: Between September 2003 and December 2008 we 
      performed endoscopic balloon dilations in 37 Crohn's disease patients with 39
      intestinal symptomatic strictures (4 naive and 35 postoperative). Dilations were 
      performed using a Rigiflex through-the-scope balloon. Clinical success rate was
      claimed if a patient remained asymptomatic and did not require surgery or further
      endoscopic dilation, following technical success. Actuarial curves of clinical,
      endoscopic (redilation) and surgical recurrence were obtained by Kaplan-Meier
      method. Demographic and disease variables were related to the main outcomes.
      RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 26.3 months (range, 2-61 months), the
      long-term global benefit rate was 89% (33/37). The 1-2-3 years cumulative
      symptom-free rates were respectively: 76%, 55% and 46%. Four patients were
      operated upon. Technical success predicts a lower rate of surgery. There were no 
      complications related to the endoscopic procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic
      balloon dilation of symptomatic Crohn's disease strictures may achieve clinical
      benefit in many patients and is a valid alternative to surgery in the management 
      of the disease. Dilation may be repeated in recurrent intestinal obstructions and
      appears safe without morbidity.

TI  - Risk factors for neoplasia in inflammatory bowel disease patients with
      pancolitis.
PG  - 2405-11
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2010.248 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Colorectal cancer (CRC), developing from dysplastic lesions, is the
      main long-term complication of pancolitis. The aims of the present study were to 
      assess the risks for neoplasia and advanced neoplasia (AN), respectively, in
      ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) patients with pancolitis, and to
      search for protective and risk factors for colorectal neoplasia. METHODS: A total
      of 855 inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with longstanding pancolitis
      (276 UC, 56 IBD unclassified (IBDu), and 523 CD) had pathological examination of 
      a proctocolectomy specimen (n=255) or multiple biopsy samples from a surveillance
      colonoscopy (n=600) after median disease duration of 115 months. Risk factors for
      low-grade dysplasia (LGD) and AN, respectively, were searched for in the whole
      group of patients and in a case-control comparison after matching for IBD
      phenotype. RESULTS: A total of 75 patients eventually developed colorectal
      neoplasia: 14 adenomas, 28 nonadenomatous LGD, and 33 ANs. The 25-year cumulative
      risks for neoplasia and AN, respectively, were 32.8+/-5.7% and 25.9+/-5.7% in UC 
      and IBDu vs. 12.1+/-2.7% and 3.9+/-2.0% in CD (P<0.0001). In CD, patients with
      UC-like endoscopic appearance (n=126) had an increased risk for AN compared with 
      those with discrete lesions (at 25 years, 10.6+/-7.2 vs. 1.5+/-0.9%). In the
      case-control comparison, factors associated with an increased risk of AN were
      primary sclerosing cholangitis (hazard ratio (HR) 4.72 (1.54-14.52)) and family
      history of CRC (HR 3.37 (1.02-11.14)), whereas previous segmental colectomy was
      protective (HR 0.25 (0.07-0.88)). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of AN in longstanding
      pancolitis is higher in UC or IBDu than in CD. In CD, this risk is significantly 
      increased in patients with UC-like endoscopic lesions. The surveillance program
      should focus on these latter patients.

AB  - [Case 1] A 41-year-old man had undergone multiple bowel resections and
      consequently short bowel syndrome with high-output jejunostomy developed. In July
      2008, he started infliximab (IFX) treatment and achieved remission and recovery
      from cholestatic liver damage following the cessation of home parenteral
      nutrition (HPN). [Case 2] A 29-year-old woman chose HPN over enteral nutrition
      because of high-output fecal fluids through a rectovaginal fistula. Treatment
      with IFX and dietary control reduced her perianal discomfort. In these 2
      patients, treatment with IFX successfully replaced long-term HPN which maintained
      remission, and improved quality of life.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ileocaecal resection for penetrating Crohn's disease is still
      challenging with a high rate of post-operative morbidity and faecal diversion.
      AIM: To report retrospectively the results of pre-operative management for
      penetrating Crohn's disease focusing on the rate of post-operative major
      morbidities and need for faecal diversion. METHODS: Between 1997 and 2007, 78
      patients with penetrating Crohn's disease underwent a first ileocaecal resection 
      after a pre-operative management consisting in bowel rest, nutritional therapy,
      intravenous antibiotics, weaning off steroids and immunosuppressors, and drainage
      of abscesses when appropriate. RESULTS: Resection was performed for terminal
      ileitis associated with (n = 41), abscesses (n = 37) or both (n = 5). A
      pre-operative nutritional therapy was performed in 50 patients (68%) for 23 days 
      (range, 7-69 days) along with a weaning off steroids and immunosuppressors. A
      diverting stoma was performed for six patients (7.7%). There was no
      post-operative death. Post-operative complications were classified as minor in 10
      patients (12.8%), and major in four patients (5%). Overall, the post-operative
      course was uneventful in 58 patients (74%). CONCLUSION: Pre-operative management 
      for penetrating Crohn's disease allowed ileocaecal resection with low rates of
      post-operative morbidity and faecal diversion.

PG  - 130-9

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Growth hormone (GH) may reduce symptoms and improve growth in Crohn
      disease (CD). The effect on mucosal inflammation is not known. We hypothesized
      that GH would improve both clinical and mucosal disease activity and stimulate
      linear growth in pediatric CD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients ages 7 to 18
      receiving corticosteroids (CTX) for active CD were randomized to begin GH, 0.075 
      mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) (group A), or continue CTX alone (group B). Clinical and
      endoscopic disease activities were assessed after 12 weeks. Group B began GH at
      12 weeks, and clinical disease activity was assessed at 24 weeks. Subjects who
      experienced a clinical response after 12 weeks of GH therapy continued treatment 
      for an additional 52 weeks, and linear growth was assessed. RESULTS: Sixty-five
      percent of patients receiving GH achieved clinical remission, compared with 20%
      treated with CTX alone (P = 0.03). Although endoscopic disease activity trended
      toward an improvement at week 12 in group A, this did not differ between the
      groups. Sixty-one percent of week 12 GH responders maintained their clinical
      response through week 64. Mean (95th confidence interval) height z score on GH
      increased from -1.1 (-1.6, -0.6) to -0.4 (-1, 0.2), P = 0.004 during this 52-week
      extension phase. GH was well tolerated with no unexpected safety signals.
      CONCLUSIONS: The addition of GH to CTX therapy did not induce a reduction in
      mucosal inflammation, relative to CTX alone. However, GH was safe and effective
      as an adjunct to CTX for treatment of clinical disease activity and growth
      failure in pediatric CD.

PG  - 1230-6
LID - 10.1542/peds.2009-1936 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The goal was to compare the predictive values of the Prometheus
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Serology 7 (IBD7) panel (Prometheus
      Laboratories, San Diego, CA) with the predictive values of routine blood tests in
      a population of children referred for initial evaluation of suspected IBD.
      METHODS: Medical records of pediatric patients referred for evaluation of IBD for
      whom IBD7 testing was performed at Prometheus Laboratories between January 2006
      and November 2008 were reviewed. Patients underwent diagnosis by pediatric
      gastroenterologists on the basis of clinical, radiologic, endoscopic, and
      pathologic evaluations. RESULTS: A total of 394 records were identified. We
      excluded 90 records on the basis of age of >21 years, previous diagnosis of IBD, 
      or unclear diagnosis. The prevalence of IBD in this cohort was 38%. The
      sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value,
      and kappa value for the serological panel were 67%, 76%, 63%, 79%, and 42%,
      respectively, compared with values for a combination of 3 abnormal routine
      laboratory test results of 72%, 94%, 85%, 79%, and 47%. The antiflagellin
      antibody assay, the newest assay added to the panel, had sensitivity of 50% and
      specificity of 53%. Repeat serological testing failed to produce consistent
      results for 4 of 10 patients. CONCLUSION: Despite its recent inclusion of the
      antiflagellin assay, the IBD7 panel has lower predictive values than routine
      laboratory tests in pediatric screening for IBD.

PG  - 197-202
LID - 10.1007/s10620-010-1235-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with Crohn's disease might have accelerated atherosclerosis 
      due to: chronic systemic inflammation, metabolic changes or prolonged steroid
      treatment. AIMS: The aim of this study was to assess the risk of sub-clinical
      atherosclerosis in Crohn's disease, by measuring the intima-media thickness and
      peak systolic velocity of the common carotid artery. METHODS: Fifty Crohn's
      disease patients aged between 20 and 45 years were compared to 25 controls.
      Patients with a family history of cardiovascular diseases or a known risk for
      atherosclerosis were excluded. All participants underwent nutritional assessment.
      Carotid artery ultrasonography was performed and intima-media thickness and peak 
      systolic velocity were measured, proximal to the common carotid bifurcation.
      Clinical data and laboratory parameters (hemoglobin, highly sensitive C-reactive 
      protein, and plasma homocysteine) were determined. RESULTS: No significant
      differences between the groups were found for intima-media thickness or peak
      systolic velocity. Multiple regression analysis revealed a positive correlation
      of intima-media thickness with older age. Peak systolic velocity was negatively
      associated with age. CONCLUSIONS: Crohn's disease patients do not have an
      increased risk for developing early atherosclerosis.

TI  - Incidence and risk of intestinal and extra-intestinal complications in Medicaid
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a 5-year population-based study.
PG  - 1689-95
LID - 10.1007/s10620-010-1236-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Intestinal and extra-intestinal complications are associated 
      with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) but their exact incidence is not well
      known. In order to improve our understanding of their incidence and impact, we
      assessed the complications associated with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's
      disease (CD) in a population-based study in Medicaid patients. METHODS: We
      utilized a retrospective cohort design and identified cases of UC and CD using
      Medi-Cal, the Medicaid program for the State of California. The disease cohort
      was age- and gender-matched to four controls each and the intestinal and
      extra-intestinal complications of CD and UC (analyzed separately) were studied
      over a period of 5 years following the initial diagnosis. RESULTS: For UC, the
      total number of intestinal complications, per 100 cases, was 92 observed compared
      to 21 expected; the total number of extra-intestinal complications was 42
      observed compared to 30 expected. For CD, the number of intestinal complications 
      was 81 observed compared to 20 expected and for extra-intestinal complications,
      37 observed compared to 26 expected (all p < 0.001). For both UC and CD, bleeding
      was the most frequently seen intestinal complication, while the most common
      extra-intestinal complication was osteoporosis. CONCLUSIONS: IBD is associated
      with several intestinal and extra-intestinal complications of variable incidence 
      and risk. Success of therapeutic regimens should be measured by decreases in
      incidence, risks, and costs of these complications, in addition to the usual
      impact on disease activity.

PG  - 35-40
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181c2c0ef [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: : Quality of life (QOL) is reportedly poor in children with Crohn
      disease (CD) but improves with increasing disease duration. This article aims to 
      detail QOL in a cohort of Australian children with CD in relation to disease
      duration, disease activity, and treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: : QOL, assessed
      using the IMPACT-III questionnaire, and disease activity measures, assessed using
      the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI), were available in 41
      children with CD. For this cohort, a total of 186 measurements of both parameters
      were available. RESULTS: : QOL was found to be significantly lower, and disease
      activity significantly higher (F = 31.1, P = 0.00), in patients within 6 months
      of their diagnosis compared with those up to 2.5 years, up to 5 years, and beyond
      5 years since diagnosis. Higher disease activity was associated with poorer QOL
      (r = -0.51, P = 0.00). Total QOL was highest in children on nil medications and
      lowest in children on enteral nutrition. The PCDAI (t = -6.0, P = 0.00) was a
      significant predictor of QOL, with the clinical history (t = -6.9, P = 0.00) and 
      examination (t = -2.9, P = 0.01) sections of the PCDAI significantly predicting
      QOL. Disease duration, age, or sex was neither related to nor significant
      predictors of QOL, but height z score and type of treatment approached
      significance. CONCLUSIONS: : Children with CD within 6 months of their diagnosis 
      have impaired QOL compared with those diagnosed beyond 6 months. These patients, 
      along with those with growth impairment, ongoing elevated disease activity with
      abdominal pain, diarrhoea and/or perirectal and extraintestinal complications,
      may benefit from regular assessments of QOL as part of their clinical treatment.

AB  - Recent genome-wide association studies have provided evidence for the involvement
      of the genes PTPN2 and PTPN22 in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). We
      investigated whether genetic variants in these genes were associated with CD in a
      New Zealand population. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs2542151 (PTPN2) 
      and rs2476601 (PTPN22) were genotyped in 315 CD cases and 481 controls. In this
      sample, we were able to confirm an association between CD and PTPN2 (genotypic P 
      = 0.019 and allelic P = 0.011), and phenotypic analysis showed an association of 
      this SNP with late age at first diagnosis, inflammatory and penetrating CD
      behaviour, requirement of bowel resection and being a smoker at diagnosis. There 
      was no evidence for an association with PTPN22.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diarrhea is common in patients with Crohn's disease and may be
      accompanied by acid base disorders, most commonly metabolic acidosis due to
      intestinal loss of bicarbonate. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we present a case of
      severe metabolic alkalosis in a young patient suffering from M. Crohn. The
      patient had undergone multiple resections of the intestine and suffered from
      chronic kidney disease. He was now referred to our clinic for recurrent acute
      kidney injury, the nature of which was pre-renal due to profound volume
      depletion. Renal failure was associated with marked hypochloremic metabolic
      alkalosis which only responded to high volume repletion and high dose blockade of
      gastric hypersecretion. Intestinal failure with stomal fluid losses of up to 5.7 
      litres per day required port implantation to commence parenteral nutrition. Fluid
      and electrolyte replacement rapidly improved renal function and acid base
      homeostasis. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the important role of
      gastrointestinal function to maintain acid base status in patients with Crohn's
      disease.

TI  - Update on the role of probiotics in the therapy of pediatric inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 47-54
AB  - Probiotics have had many applications in the past few years, and inflammatory
      conditions of the GI tract--including chronic disorders such as inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD)--have received the most attention by investigators. In fact, 
      the experimental basis to expect clinical efficacy of probiotics in IBD is quite 
      robust. In spite of this however, only minimal evidence of benefit by any
      probiotic is currently available in Crohn's disease, either in adult or in
      pediatric populations. In ulcerative colitis, on the other hand, several
      probiotic formulations and especially the proprietary preparation VSL#3 (a
      high-concentration mixture) have been found effective as adjuvant therapy, both
      in inducing and maintaining remission.

TI  - [Croatian guidelines for use of enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease].
PG  - 1-7
AB  - Nutrition has an important role in the management of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD), especially in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). This role includes the
      prevention and correction of malnutrition, the prevention of osteoporosis and the
      promotion of optimal growth and development in children. In active Crohn's
      disease, nutritional therapy (in the form of enteral feeding) is an effective
      primary therapy for pediatric patients. Studies have shown that there is no
      difference in the efficacy of elemental, oligomeric and polymeric enteral
      formulas. Therefore, the use of polymeric formula is recommended because of
      higher palatability, better acceptance by patients, lower rate of complications
      and lower cost when compared with other enteral formulas. Today we have knowledge
      that some nutrients which are added to modified special enteral formulas have
      almost pharmacological terapeutic potential in the management of inflammatory
      bowel disease. Novel nutritional therapeutic strategies for inflammatory bowel
      disease, such as transforming growth factor-beta-enriched (TGF-beta2) enteral
      feeding, showed beneficial effects in several clinical studies. Croatian
      guidelines for enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease have been developed by
      interdisciplinary expert group of Croatian clinicians involved with inflammatory 
      bowel disease. The guidelines are based on evidence from relevant medical
      literature and clinical experience of working group.

      disease?
PG  - 191-215
LID - 10.1586/egh.10.11 [doi]
AB  - Prescription drugs and surgery are two common medical therapies for Crohn's
      disease (CD), an inflammatory bowel disease that affects the GI tract.
      Unfortunately, certain drugs can cause serious side effects, and surgeries must
      often be repeated. No diet has been established to alleviate the pain and
      suffering of CD patients. This is curious given the fact that a higher prevalence
      of food sensitivities exist in this population of patients, and enteral nutrition
      is not only the first-line of therapy in Japan, but a known research method used 
      to place the majority of CD patients into remission. Although not all patients
      respond equally to diet, many simply remove symptom-provoking foods, such as
      dairy, wheat, corn and certain fruits and vegetables. We suggest assisting these 
      patients in their self-assessment of irritating and symptom-provoking foods by
      educating them in the use of a food-symptom diary followed by a customized
      elimination diet trialed for 2-4 weeks to determine if there is any benefit to
      the individual patient.

AB  - Recent genome-wide association studies have provided evidence for the involvement
      of 3p21 in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). Here we attempted to
      validate the 3p21 region in a well characterized CD case-control New Zealand
      dataset of 329 CD patients and 521 controls by genotyping tagging single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across this region. Analysis revealed significant
      differences between patients and controls for six of 14 SNPs: rs9874472,
      rs1800668, rs11716445, rs4283605, rs2131109, and rs6446298. Five of these
      demonstrated strong interaction with CARD15 and phenotypic analysis demonstrated 
      association of these SNPs with age at first diagnosis, CD location, CD behavior
      and requirement of bowel resection. The results from this study support the
      accumulating evidence that suggests the 3p21 region is a CD-associated locus,
      although it remains unclear which is the causative SNP and/or gene.

TI  - Vitamin D-mediated calcium absorption in patients with clinically stable Crohn's 
      disease: a pilot study.
PG  - 1085-91
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.200900351 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin D is the critical hormone for intestinal absorption of calcium. Optimal
      calcium absorption is important for proper mineralization of bone in the
      prevention of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures, among other important
      functions. Diseases associated with gut inflammation, such as Crohn's disease
      (CD), may impair calcium absorption. This pilot study evaluated vitamin D-
      dependent calcium absorption in subjects with CD. Male subjects with CD (n=4) and
      healthy age-matched controls (n=5) were studied. All subjects had fractional
      calcium absorption (FCA; by the dual calcium isotope method), serum
      25-hydroxyvitamin D, serum calcium and 24 h urinary calcium excretion
      measurements at baseline. The FCA in response to vitamin D therapy was
      re-assessed following administration of oral calcitriol 0.25 mcg twice daily for 
      1 wk, followed by oral calcitriol 0.50 mcg twice daily for 1 wk. Serum calcium
      and 24 h urinary calcium determinations were re-assessed after each increasing
      dose of calcitriol as safety measures. There was no significant difference in
      calcium FCA at baseline or after increasing doses of calcitriol between the CD
      and controls. FCA in the control and CD group was approximately 35% at baseline, 
      which increased to 60% after calcitriol therapy. No subject developed
      hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria. Our results suggest that CD patients have a
      normal response to vitamin D in enhancing the efficacy of calcium absorption.
      This suggests that stable CD patients can follow calcium and vitamin D guidelines
      of non-CD adults. Other factors independent of vitamin D status may impair
      intestinal calcium absorption in CD, including the degree and location of
      inflammation, presence of surgical resection and/or use of glucocorticoids.

TI  - The association of inflammatory bowel disease and Mediterranean fever gene (MEFV)
      mutations in Turkish children.
PG  - 3488-94
LID - 10.1007/s10620-010-1178-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) concordance has been investigated in a few studies. We investigated
      MEFV mutations and prevalence of FMF disease in Turkish children with IBD and
      their relationship with the disease severity. METHODS: Sixteen patients with
      ulcerative colitis (UC), 14 with Crohn's disease (CD) and three with
      indeterminate colitis (IC) were enrolled in the study (median age 13 years, range
      0.6-16 years, n = 19 boys). Demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics 
      of the patients were evaluated as well as the parameters of disease severity. All
      patients were screened for 12 common MEFV mutations. RESULTS: MEFV mutations were
      detected in 17 of 66 (25.7%) alleles. Seven patients (four patients with CD, two 
      with IC, and one with UC) were also diagnosed as FMF. FMF disease was found in
      seven of all IBD patients (21.2%) and four of them had CD. M694V was the leading 
      mutation, and as a disease-causing mutation, it was found to be significantly
      more frequent in CD patients than UC patients (Fisher's exact test P = 0.03).
      Demographics, laboratory evaluations, growth parameters, extraintestinal
      manifestations, and treatment with immunosuppressive agents other than steroids
      were comparable between the patients with and without FMF in most aspects.
      CONCLUSIONS: Although this is a small cohort, disease-causing MEFV mutations and 
      FMF disease rate were increased among our patients with IBD. The increase was
      prominent among CD patients, whereas in UC the rate was similar to the Turkish
      healthy control population.

TI  - A novel risk score to stratify severity of Crohn's disease hospitalizations.
PG  - 1799-807
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2010.105 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Crohn's disease (CD) is a lifelong relapsing-remitting disease often 
      requiring health-care contact, hospitalization, or surgery. General comorbidity
      indices were developed to predict mortality, which is rare in this population.
      There are limited tools to stratify these hospitalizations by severity. METHODS: 
      We used data obtained from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample 2004 to identify all
      CD-related hospitalizations using discharge diagnosis codes (International
      Classification of Diseases, 9th edition, Clinical Modification, ICD-9-CM, 555.x).
      Independent predictors on multivariate regression were identified and used to
      construct a quantitative risk score to predict severe hospitalizations (defined
      as requiring nonelective bowel surgery or hospitalization longer than 7 days).
      The performance of our risk score was compared with the Elixhauser and Charlson
      comorbidity indices, and validated in an independent sample of CD
      hospitalizations from 2007. RESULTS: Our final study cohort consisted of 25,938
      discharges, among which 6,169 were determined to be severe hospitalizations
      (23.8%). Independent predictors of disease severity included disease phenotype,
      anemia, malnutrition, and requirement for blood transfusion or total parenteral
      nutrition, as well as Clostridium difficile infection, admission to a teaching
      hospital, or inter-hospital transfer. The cumulative risk score ranged from 0 to 
      13 points, with scores >or=5 being considered to be of greater severity. A total 
      of 15,330 (59.1%), 9,060 (34.9%), and 1,548 (6.0%) discharges were classified as 
      being of low, intermediate, and high risk, respectively. An intermediate (odds
      ratio (OR) 2.63, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.47-2.80) or high-risk score (OR 
      13.62, 95% CI: 12.12-15.33) was associated with a significantly higher adjusted
      risk of severe hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Using administrative data, we
      propose a simple quantitative risk score to measure the severity of CD
      hospitalizations.

TI  - Scheduled maintenance therapy with infliximab improves the prognosis of Crohn's
      disease: a single center prospective cohort study in Japan.
PG  - 207-15
AB  - The main goal of Crohn's disease (CD) treatment at present is to induce and
      maintain remission for as long as possible, and several approaches have been used
      as induction and maintenance therapies. There are no reports that have compared
      the effects on mid- and long-term prognosis among the induction and maintenance
      therapies, especially between infliximab, a chimeric antibody to tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha, and nutritional therapies. A total of 262 CD patients with induced 
      remission were enrolled in the cohort study. Patients who failed to achieve
      remission, and patients who were lost to follow-up within 12 months were
      excluded. Induction therapies for CD included total elemental enteral nutrition, 
      total parenteral nutrition, infliximab, prednisolone, and surgical resection.
      Maintenance therapies included home elemental diet, 5-aminosalicylates,
      immunomodulators, and scheduled infliximab therapy. We evaluated the possible
      predictive factors of relapse and surgical recurrence including the clinical
      backgrounds of the patients and medical therapies, using the Cox multivariate
      hazard analysis. The main factors that strongly affected the first relapse were
      scheduled infliximab therapy (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.24, p < 0.0001), surgical
      induction (HR = 0.19, p < 0.0001) and high frequency of previous relapse (HR =
      2.56, p = 0.002). Penetrating (HR = 3.33, p = 0.009) and stricturing (HR = 6.60, 
      p < 0.0001) disease behavior were main risk factors of surgical recurrence.
      Scheduled infliximab therapy is the most effective maintenance therapy in a real 
      clinical setting with respect to the mid- and long-term prognosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A 17-year-old white male with Crohn's disease who was receiving
      maintenance infusions of the anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agent, infliximab, 
      presented with a new-onset psoriasiform skin rash. The rash was not responsive to
      topical or oral corticosteroids and worsened after infliximab infusions and after
      subsequent administration of a second anti-TNF drug, adalimumab. INVESTIGATIONS: 
      Full medical history and physical examination, including assessment of the
      morphology of rash and the temporal correlation with administration of anti-TNF
      agents. DIAGNOSIS: Anti-TNF-agent induced psoriasiform skin rash. MANAGEMENT:
      Discontinuation of anti-TNF therapy. The patient opted to have his
      gastrointestinal symptoms treated with oral mesalazine and metronidazole.

TI  - Impaired erythrocyte antioxidant defense in active inflammatory bowel disease:
      impact of anemia and treatment.
PG  - 1467-75
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21234 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress contributes to the propagation and exacerbation of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) but the status of erythrocyte antioxidant
      defense remains unknown. METHODS: Erythrocyte activities of superoxide
      dismutase-1 (SOD1), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx1) were determined
      in 174 IBD patients and 105 controls and referred to IBD activity, inflammation
      severity, nutritional status, systemic oxidative stress, anemia, and treatment.
      RESULTS: Catalase and GPx1 activities were decreased in active IBD, whereas SOD1 
      became upregulated by IBD-related oxidative stress. In Crohn's disease (CD)
      corticosteroids decreased SOD1 activity. SOD1 correlated indirectly with CD
      activity and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and directly with transferrin. 
      In ulcerative colitis (UC) anemia downregulated SOD1. Decreases in GPx activity
      corresponded with IBD activity, anemia, inflammation, and malnutrition. Oxidative
      stress in UC and corticosteroids in CD also downregulated GPx. Catalase activity 
      was decreased by CD-related anemia, correlating directly with hemoglobin, and
      indirectly with CD activity, inflammatory and protein oxidative stress markers.
      When co-analyzed, anemia but not CD activity significantly contributed to
      catalase downregulation. In UC, catalase activity corresponded indirectly with UC
      endoscopic activity and inflammation and directly with hemoglobin. UC activity,
      anemia, and treatment with azathioprine negatively affected catalase. As
      indicators of active IBD, GPx1 showed a diagnostic accuracy of 73%, whereas
      catalase showed 63% as compared to 74% of C-reactive protein and ESR.
      CONCLUSIONS: Erythrocyte antioxidant defense is impaired in active IBD. SOD1,
      GPx1, and CAT activities are differently affected by the disease type, activity, 
      anemia, inflammation, oxidative stress, and treatment. As an active IBD
      indicator, GPx1 was comparable to C-reactive protein and ESR.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of preformed donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) as a barrier
      to isolated intestinal transplantation (ITx) remains ambiguous; thus, a positive 
      cross-match has not been a contraindication to ITx. OBJECTIVE: To report the case
      of a patient with Crohn's disease who underwent ITx and developed immediate
      antibody-mediated rejection on reperfusion of the allograft. METHODS: Percent
      reactive antibody testing was performed using pretransplantation serum samples
      and at transplantation using bead-based assays (Luminex, Luminex Corp, Austin,
      Tex) and flow cytometry solid-phase assays (FlowPRA single-antigen beads (One
      Lambda, Inc, Canoga Park, Calif). Serologic tests, flow cytometry cross-matching,
      and flow cytometry assays of C4d-binding serum antibodies were also performed.
      Histologic and immunofluorescent analysis of biopsy specimens was performed.
      RESULTS: HLA typing revealed no sharing of class I or II antigens between donor
      and recipient. Pretransplantation donor-specific antibodies (DSA) were present at
      transplantation. Cross-matching (performed during surgery) was positive for class
      I and II by serologic testing and flow cytometry. After reperfusion, the graft
      immediately developed severe ischemic injury and arteritis on mucosal biopsy
      specimens, with immunoglobulin deposition. The DSA C4d binding antibodies were
      also present. After intense immunosuppression and plasmapheresis, the graft and
      the biopsy histologic findings showed marked improvement (day 2). By day 7
      posttransplantation, patient and graft status were stable. The patient has
      remained clinically stable for more than a year after transplantation.
      CONCLUSIONS: Pretransplant DSA in ITx can be a risk factor for immediate
      (hyperacute) but potentially reversible antibody-mediated rejection. Thus,
      pretransplantation DSA and cross-match results are critical components to be
      considered in patients awaiting or undergoing ITx.

TI  - Nutritional status and growth in pediatric Crohn's disease: a population-based
      study.
PG  - 1893-900
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2010.20 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Growth retardation and malnutrition are major features of pediatric
      Crohn's disease (CD). We examined nutritional and growth parameters from
      diagnosis to maximal follow-up in a population-based pediatric cohort, and we
      determined predictive factors. METHODS: A total of 261 patients (156 boys, 105
      girls) with onset of CD before the age of 17 were identified from 1988 to 2004
      through the EPIMAD registry (Registre des Maladies Inflammatoires Chroniques de
      l'Intestin) in northern France. Median age at diagnosis was 13 years (11.2-15.4) 
      and median follow-up was 73 months (46-114). Z-scores of height/age, weight/age, 
      and body mass index (BMI)/age were determined. Multivariate stepwise regression
      analysis identified predictive factors for malnutrition and growth retardation at
      maximal follow-up. RESULTS: At diagnosis, 25 children (9.5%) showed height less
      than -2 s.d., 70 (27%) weight less than -2 s.d., and 84 (32%) BMI less than -2
      s.d. At maximal follow-up, growth retardation was present in 18 children (6.9%), 
      whereas 40 (15%) had malnutrition. Nutritional status was more severely impaired 
      in children with stricturing disease. Growth and nutritional retardation at
      diagnosis, young age, male gender, and extraintestinal manifestations at
      diagnosis were indicators of poor prognosis. A significant compensation was
      observed for weight and BMI in both genders and for height in girls. No treatment
      was associated with height, weight, or BMI at maximal follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      our pediatric population-based study, growth retardation and severe malnutrition 
      were still present at maximal follow-up in 6.9 and 15% of CD children,
      respectively. Young boys with substantial inflammatory manifestations of CD have 
      a higher risk of subsequent growth failure, especially when growth retardation is
      present at diagnosis.

TI  - Clinical relevance of IgG antibodies against food antigens in Crohn's disease: a 
      double-blind cross-over diet intervention study.
PG  - 252-64
LID - 10.1159/000264649 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Environmental factors are thought to play an important role in the
      development of Crohn's disease (CD). Immune responses against auto-antigens or
      food antigens may be a reason for the perpetuation of inflammation. METHODS: In a
      pilot study, 79 CD patients and 20 healthy controls were examined for food
      immunoglobulin G (IgG). Thereafter, the clinical relevance of these food IgG
      antibodies was assessed in a double-blind cross-over study with 40 patients.
      Based on the IgG antibodies, a nutritional intervention was planned. The
      interferon (IFN)gamma secretion of T cells was measured. Eosinophil-derived
      neurotoxin was quantified in stool. RESULTS: The pilot study resulted in a
      significant difference of IgG antibodies in serum between CD patients and healthy
      controls. In 84 and 83% of the patients, respectively, IgG antibodies against
      processed cheese and yeast were detected. The daily stool frequency significantly
      decreased by 11% during a specific diet compared with a sham diet. Abdominal pain
      reduced and general well-being improved. IFNgamma secretion of T cells increased.
      No difference for eosinophil-derived neurotoxin in stool was detected.
      CONCLUSION: A nutritional intervention based on circulating IgG antibodies
      against food antigens showed effects with respect to stool frequency. The
      mechanisms by which IgG antibodies might contribute to disease activity remain to
      be elucidated.

TI  - Final adult height of children with inflammatory bowel disease is predicted by
      parental height and patient minimum height Z-score.
PG  - 1669-77
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21214 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was designed to elucidate the contribution of parental
      height to the stature of children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), who
      often exhibit growth impairment. Accordingly, we compared patients' final adult
      heights and target heights based on measured parental heights and examined
      predictors of final adult height in pediatric IBD patients. METHODS: We
      prospectively analyzed the growth of 295 patients diagnosed between ages 1 and 18
      (211 Crohn's disease [CD], 84 ulcerative colitis [UC]) and their family members
      (283 mothers, 231 fathers, 55 siblings). RESULTS: Twenty-two percent had growth
      impairment (height for age Z-score <-1.64, equivalent to <5th percentile on
      growth curve) in more than 1 measurement since diagnosis; most growth-impaired
      patients had CD (88% CD versus 12% UC). Parents of the growth-impaired group had 
      lower mean height Z-scores compared to parents of nongrowth-impaired patients
      (-0.67 versus 0.02 for mothers [P < 0.001]; -0.31 versus 0.22 for fathers [P =
      0.002]). For 108 patients who reached adult heights and had available parental
      heights, the growth-impaired group continued to demonstrate lower adult height
      Z-scores (-1.38 versus 0.07; P < 0.001). Adult heights were within 1 SD of target
      heights even for the growth-impaired group. Only 11.3% remained persistently
      growth-impaired in adulthood. Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated lower
      parental height and minimum patient height Z-score as significant predictors of
      lower final adult height in IBD. CONCLUSIONS: Parental height is a powerful
      determinant of linear growth even in the presence of chronic inflammation, and
      should be an integral part of the evaluation of growth in IBD children.

AB  - 75% of hospital patients with Crohn's disease (CD) suffer from malnutrition and
      one third of CD patients have a body mass index below 20. Inflammatory bowel
      diseases (IBD) patients have many vitamin and nutrient deficiencies which can
      lead to important consequences such as hyperhomocysteinemia which is associated
      with a higher risk of thromboembolic disease. Nutritional deficiencies in IBD
      patients are the result of insufficient intake, malabsorption and protein-losing 
      enteropathy as well as the metabolic distubances directly induced by the chronic 
      disease and its treatments, in particular corticosteroids. Screening for
      nutritional deficiencies in chronic disease patients is warranted. Managing the
      deficiencies involves simple nutritional guidelines, vitamin supplements, and
      nutritional support in the worst cases, in particular in children in order to
      limit the impact of IBD on growth. In active CD, enteral nutrition is the first
      line therapy in children and should be used as sole therapy in adults mainly when
      treatment with corticosteroids is not feasible.

      Immunosuppressants and biologic agents: should they or need they be used
      together? How to use immunosuppressive therapy better (and safer) tomorrow?
PG  - S202-8
LID - 10.1016/S0399-8320(09)73155-0 [doi]
AB  - Although the use of concomitant immunosuppressants (IS) with biologics has been
      demonstrated to reduce the immunogenicity of chimeric (infliximab), humanized
      (natalizumab), human (adalimumab) antibodies and antibody fragments (certolizumab
      pegol), to date concomitant IS with biologics has not impacted on the short or
      intermediate responses in the treatment of Crohn's disease in most induction and 
      maintenance trials. The optimal strategy to reduce antibodies to infliximab is to
      use an induction and maintenance strategy rather than episodic therapy. Any
      potential benefit of concomitant IS use with biologic agents needs to be balanced
      against the risk of combination therapy including serious infections and the risk
      of neoplasia. The discovery of genetic polymorphism for production of thiopurine 
      methyltransferase (TPMT), a key enzyme in the metabolism of thiopurine
      antimetabolites, has made it possible to rationalize therapy in terms of patient 
      and dosage selection. TPMT screening prior to initiation of thiopurine
      antimetabolites is currently recommended to avoid treating patients with low or
      absent TPMT activity with potentially toxic doses of thiopurines. Routine
      monitoring of blood counts and liver enzymes is recommended even in individuals
      with normal TPMT activity. The ability to monitor thiopurine metabolites may make
      it possible to optimize therapeutic response by guiding clinicians on dose
      escalation.

AB  - Patients with chronic colitis (ulcerative colitis or colonic Crohn's disease)
      have an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). Although most of the molecular
      alterations reported in sporadic CRC have also been observed in
      colitis-associated CRC, they do not occur at the same timing and frequency,
      indicating a different pathophysiology. In particular, recent work highlighted
      the importance of chronic mucosal inflammation as a key factor favouring
      colorectal carcinogenesis in these patients. This may also be one of the reasons 
      explaining the role of 5-aminosalicylates as chemopreventive agents for CRC in
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with colonic involvement. Beside
      chemoprevention, colonoscopic screening and surveillance have been shown to be
      the cornerstone for CRC prevention and early detection in this particular
      patients' population. Periodic surveillance colonoscopy to detect dysplasia has
      been shown to decrease the mortality attributed to CRC. More recently, progress
      in imaging techniques increased our ability to identify dysplasia, and should
      probably now be considered to be an integral part of surveillance colonoscopy. In
      the future, further improvement of our knowledge of CRC biology, refinement of
      imaging techniques, as well as molecular discovery (e.g. identification of
      specific mutations in stool DNA extracts), might lead to develop more accurate
      diagnostic strategies to reduce the morbidity and mortality related to CRC in
      patients with ulcerative colitis or colonic Crohn's disease.

AB  - Rapid increase in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) incidence in
      developed countries, occurrence of CD in spouses and lack of complete concordance
      in monozygotic twins are strong arguments for the role of environmental factors
      in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Only two environmental factors have an
      established role in IBD. Smoking is a risk factor for CD and a protective factor 
      for UC; appendectomy is a protective factor for UC. Many other environmental
      factors for IBD have been investigated. These are infectious agents, diet, drugs,
      stress and socio-economic factors. They are detailed in this paper. Among them,
      adherent invasive E. coli, infectious gastroenteritis, oral contraceptives and
      antibiotics could play a role in CD. To date, three theories integrate
      environmental factors to pathogenesis of IBD: hygiene, infection and cold chain. 
      Much work remains to be done to identify risk factors for IBD. As exemplified by 
      smoking, research of environmental risk factors of IBD is useful since it may
      lead to an improved disease course among patients and perhaps, to appropriate
      prevention among predisposed subjects. Further studies in this field are eagerly 
      awaited.

AB  - The genetic component of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases is among the best known for 
      complex genetic disorders. If the functional candidate gene approach was rarely
      fruitful in the past, genome-wide scans allowed finding several susceptibility
      genes for Crohn disease including NOD2, IL23R, ATG16L1, IRGM, TNFSF15, a region
      close to PTGER4, PTPN2, PTPN22, NKX2-3 and many others. Only one gene, ECM1, has 
      been reported for ulcerative colitis alone. We now need to further explore these 
      new genes before to understand their biological role. However they clearly
      demonstrate the importance of innate immunity and autophagy for Crohn's disease
      and of the TH-17 differentiation for ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and
      other inflammatory disorders.

AB  - The Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STAT)-Janus kinase (JAK) 
      pathway controls signal transduction between cell surface receptors and the
      nucleus. Two members of that pathway, STAT3 and JAK2, enhanced the risk of
      Crohn's disease (CD) in recent genome-wide association studies. We replicated
      these findings in a New Zealand Caucasian case-control cohort, by genotyping two 
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in STAT3 (rs744166(G>A) and
      rs3816769(C>T)) and rs10758669(A>C) in JAK2, in 302 CD patients and 382 controls.
      For STAT3, there was a significant decrease in the frequency of the G allele of
      rs744166 and the C allele of rs3816769 in CD patients as compared with controls
      (OR=0.76, 95% CI=0.61-0.95, p=0.013; OR=0.71, 95% CI=0.56-0.89, p=0.003). For the
      JAK2 rs10758669 polymorphism, the homozygous C/C or heterozygous A/C genotypes
      increased the risk of having CD as compared with the homozygous A/A (OR=1.76, 95%
      CI=1.26-2.45 and OR=2.36, 95% CI=1.44-3.86, respectively, p=0.0003). Variant
      alleles in either gene significantly modified the likelihood of inflammatory
      disease in a colonic location, and of developing extra-intestinal manifestations.
      The JAK2 variant also strongly enhanced the risk of ileocolonic disease, with
      stricturing or ileal/stricturing behaviour, requiring a bowel resection. We
      further studied a subset of our control population, stratified for JAK2
      rs10758669 and/or STAT3 rs3816769 genotype. Carrying either the JAK2 or STAT3 IBD
      risk allele was associated with significantly enhanced susceptibility to DNA
      damage, as estimated by comet assays in peripheral blood leukocytes, with or
      without a subsequent oxidative challenge. That is, both risk alleles enhance
      genomic instability. The JAK2 SNP is part of a haplotype previously associated
      with enhanced susceptibility to myeloproliferative neoplasms, but functional
      consequences of the STAT3 variant had not been previously demonstrated. It will
      be of interest to follow up CD patients carrying either JAK2 or STAT3 risk
      alleles for development of further secondary effects, including cancer.

      and intestinal tuberculosis.

LID - 10.1038/ajg.2009.585 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The clinical, endoscopic, and histological features of Crohn's
      disease (CD) and intestinal tuberculosis mimic each other so much that it becomes
      difficult to differentiate between them. The aim was to find out clinical,
      endoscopic, and histological predictor features for differentiation between CD
      and intestinal tuberculosis. METHODS: We recruited 106 patients, 53 each with CD 
      and intestinal tuberculosis, in this study. The clinical, histological, and
      endoscopic features were subjected to univariate, bivariate, and multivariate
      analyses. On the basis of regression coefficients of the final multivariate
      logistic model, a score to discriminate between CD and intestinal tuberculosis
      was devised. For the validation of the score, the same model was tested on 20 new
      patients, each with CD and intestinal tuberculosis. RESULTS: On univariate
      analysis, although longer duration of disease, chronic diarrhea, blood in stool, 
      perianal disease, extra-intestinal manifestations, involvement of left colon,
      skip lesions, aphthous ulcers, cobblestoning, longitudinal ulcers, focally
      enhanced colitis, and microgranulomas were significantly more common in CD,
      partial intestinal obstruction, constipation, presence of nodular lesions, higher
      number, and larger granulomas were significantly more common in intestinal
      tuberculosis. On multivariate analysis, blood in stool (odds ratio (OR) 0.1
      (confidence interval (CI) 0.04-0.5)), weight loss (OR 9.8 (CI 2.2-43.9)),
      histologically focally enhanced colitis (OR 0.1 (CI 0.03-0.5)), and involvement
      of sigmoid colon (OR 0.07(0.01-0.3)) were independent predictors of intestinal
      tuberculosis. On the basis of regression coefficients of the final multivariate
      logistic model, a score that varied from 0.3 to 9.3 was devised. Higher score
      predicted more likelihood of intestinal tuberculosis. Once the cutoff was set at 
      5.1, then the sensitivity, specificity, and ability to correctly classify the two
      diseases were 83.0, 79.2, and 81.1%, respectively. Area under the curve for
      receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) to assess the ability of these features
      to discriminate between CD and intestinal tuberculosis was 0.9089. The area under
      ROC in the validation data set was 89.2% (95% CI 0.79-0.99). With a similar
      cutoff score of 5.1, sensitivity and specificity in the validation model were 90%
      (95% CI 66.9-98.2) and 60% (95% CI 36.4-80.0), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Blood
      in stool, weight loss, focally enhanced colitis, and involvement of the sigmoid
      colon were the most important features in differentiating CD from intestinal
      tuberculosis.

AB  - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, together popularly known as inflammatory 
      bowel disease (IBD), are characterized by a number of extraintestinal
      manifestations. Although infrequent, acute pancreatitis, and less often chronic
      pancreatitis, may occur as a result of the disease itself or secondary to the
      medications used in the treatment. The increased incidence of acute pancreatitis 
      in Crohn's disease can be explained based on the high predisposition to
      cholesterol as well as pigment stones as a result of ileal disease, anatomic
      abnormalities of the duodenum, immunologic disturbances associated with IBD, and,
      above all, to the side effects of many medications used in the treatment.
      Sulfasalazine, 5-aminosalicylic acid, azathioprine, and 6-mercaptopurine are well
      known to cause acute pancreatitis as a result of a possible idiosyncratic
      mechanism. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis share many clinical
      manifestations and treatment modalities. Nonspecific elevations of serum
      pancreatic enzymes in IBD make it difficult to avoid over diagnosis of acute
      pancreatitis, particularly in patients with Crohn's disease who suffer from
      abdominal pain often. The IBD-pancreas association is further reflected in many
      reports of exocrine as well as endocrine pancreatic insufficiency.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the evidence base for the medical
      (pharmaceutical and nutritional) treatment of paediatric inflammatory bowel
      disease. METHODS: Key clinical questions were formulated regarding different
      treatment modalities used in the treatment of paediatric (not adult-onset) IBD,
      in particular the induction and maintenance of remission in Crohn disease and
      ulcerative colitis. Electronic searches were performed from January 1966 to
      December 2006, using the electronic search strategy of the Cochrane IBD group.
      Details of papers were entered on a dedicated database, reviewed in abstract
      form, and disseminated in full for appraisal. Clinical guidelines were appraised 
      using the AGREE instrument and all other relevant papers were appraised using
      Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network methodology, with evidence levels
      given to all papers. RESULTS: A total of 6285 papers were identified, of which
      1255 involved children; these were entered on the database. After critical
      appraisal, only 103 publications met our criteria as evidence on medical
      treatment of paediatric IBD. We identified 3 clinical guidelines, 1 systematic
      review, and 16 randomised controlled trials; all were of variable quality, with
      none getting the highest methodological scores. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first
      comprehensive review of the evidence base for the treatment of paediatric IBD,
      highlighting the paucity of trials of high methodological quality. As a result,
      the development of clinical guidelines for managing children and young people
      with IBD must be consensus based, informed by the best-available evidence from
      the paediatric literature and high-quality data from the adult IBD literature,
      together with the clinical expertise and multidisciplinary experience of
      paediatric IBD experts.

      disease].
PG  - 833-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of low bone mineral density in patients
      with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)and to identify its risk factors. METHODS: A
      cross-sectional survey was carried out in IBD patients. Anthropometric measures, 
      biochemical markers of nutrition and bone mineral density measurement were
      completed for these patients as well as healthy control subjects. RESULTS:
      Seventy-seven Crohn's disease (CD) and 43 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients were
      enrolled, and 37 healthy volunteers were recruited as healthy controls (HC). The 
      T value of CD patients, UC patients and HC was -1.72 +/- 1.20, -1.26 +/- 1.12 and
      -0.62 +/- 0.87 respectively and the T value of CD patients was significantly
      lower than that of HC (P = 0.000). The prevalence of osteoporosis in CD, UC and
      HC was 23.3%, 14.0% and 0 respectively. The prevalence of osteoporosis in CD was 
      higher than that in HC (P = 0.003). Logistic regression analysis indicated that
      low BMI (BMI < or = 18.4 kg/m(2)) was an independent risk factor for osteoporosis
      both in CD (OR = 11.25, 95%CI 3.198 - 39.580, P = 0.000) and in UC (OR = 14.50,
      95%CI 1.058 - 88.200, P = 0.045) patients. Age, disease duration, clinical
      activity active index (CDAI), oral steroid therapy, immunosuppressant treatment
      and serum vitamin D concentration were not found to be correlated with
      osteoporosis in IBD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Low bone mineral density is common in 
      both CD and UC patients and low BMI is an independent risk factor for
      osteoporosis in IBD patients.

TI  - Combining nutrition, food science and engineering in developing solutions to
      Inflammatory bowel diseases--omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids as an example.
PG  - 60-72
LID - 10.1039/c0fo00057d [doi]
AB  - The Inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are
      debilitating conditions, characterised by lifelong sensitivity to certain foods, 
      and often a need for surgery and life-long medication. The anti-inflammatory
      effects of long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated acids justify their inclusion in
      enteral nutrition formulas that have been associated with disease remission.
      However, there have been variable data in clinical trials to test supplementary
      omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in inducing or maintaining remission in these
      diseases. Although variability in trial design has been suggested as a major
      factor, we suggest that variability in processing and presentation of the
      products may be equally or more important. The nature of the source, and rapidity
      of getting the fish or other food source to processing or to market, will affect 
      the percentage of the various fatty acids, possible presence of heavy metal
      contaminants and oxidation status of the various fatty acids. For dietary
      supplements or fortified foods, whether the product is encapsulated or not,
      whether storage is under nitrogen or not, and length of time between harvest,
      processing and marketing will again profoundly affect the properties of the final
      product. Clinical trials to test efficacy of these products in IBD to date have
      utilised the relevant skills of pharmacology and gastroenterology. We suggest
      that knowledge from food science, nutrition and engineering will be essential to 
      establish the true role of this important group of compounds in these diseases.

TI  - Development of Crohn's disease in patients with intestinal failure: a role for
      bacteria?
PG  - 361-3
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0b013e3181c8a4f8 [doi]
AB  - We present 3 cases of Crohn's disease that developed in patients with previously 
      diagnosed short bowel syndrome from another cause. There are characteristics
      unique to patients with short bowel syndrome that may increase their likelihood
      to develop Crohn's disease, based on current concepts of the pathophysiology of
      inflammatory bowel disease. These patients may have a higher than average
      prevalence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. This may lead to an increase
      in bacterial translocation and dysregulation of the intestinal immune response.
      In addition, these patients often require parenteral nutrition (PN) because of
      macronutrient and micronutrient deficiencies. Some patients receiving PN,
      particularly those with bowel obstructions, may be at risk for septicemia due to 
      bacterial translocation. It is thought that PN may enhance intestinal dysmotility
      and impair gut immunity, contributing further to an antigenic immune response in 
      the intestinal immune system, although supporting data is lacking. Finally,
      studies have demonstrated that patient's with Crohn's disease have a shorter
      bowel length before any intestinal resections and not related to disease
      activity. Although the significance of this is unclear, a shorter bowel length
      may potentially predispose people to the development of Crohn's disease via an
      alteration of intestinal motility and intestinal flora.

AB  - In patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis parenteral nutrition (PN)
      is indicated when enteral nutrition is not possible or should be avoided for
      medical reasons. In Crohn's patients PN is indicated when there are
      signs/symptoms of ileus or subileus in the small intestine, scars or intestinal
      fistulae. PN requires no specific compounding for chronic inflammatory bowel
      diseases. In both diseases it should be composed of 55-60% carbohydrates, 25-30% 
      lipids and 10-15% amino acids. PN helps in the correction of malnutrition,
      particularly the intake of energy, minerals, trace elements, deficiency of
      calcium, vitamin D, folic acid, vitamin B12, and zinc. Enteral nutrition is
      clearly superior to PN in severe, acute pancreatitis. An intolerance to enteral
      nutrition results in an indication for total PN in complications such as
      pseudocysts, intestinal and pancreatic fistulae, and pancreatic abscesses or
      pancreatic ascites. If enteral nutrition is not possible, PN is recommended, at
      the earliest, 5 days after admission to the hospital. TPN should not be routinely
      administered in mild acute pancreatitis or nil by moth status <7 days, due to
      high costs and an increased risk of infection. The energy requirements are
      between 25 and 35 kcal/kg body weight/day. A standard solution including lipids
      (monitoring triglyceride levels!) can be administered in acute pancreatitis.
      Glucose (max. 4-5 g/kg body weight/day) and amino acids (about 1.2-1.5 g/kg body 
      weight/day) should be administered and the additional enrichment of TPN with
      glutamine should be considered in severe, progressive forms of pancreatitis.

TI  - [Vitamin D supplementation in adults--guidelines].
PG  - 39-45
AB  - Vitamin D is necessary in maintaining appropriate calcium and phosphate
      homeostasis in the body (classical function) and ensuring appropriate functioning
      of many tissues, organs and cells, unrelated to mineral economy (non-classical
      function). Vitamin D deficiency in adults may cause osteomalacia, increase
      fracture risk in osteoporosis, induce cardiovascular diseases, diabetes type 1
      and 2, multiple sclerosis, Lesniowski-Crohn disease, and cancer, including colon,
      breast, and prostate cancer. Possible causes of vitamin D deficiency in a healthy
      population include decreased cutaneous synthesis and an inadequate intake of
      vitamin D, both in food and in supplements. Vitamin D deficiency level (25(OH) D.
      <20 ng/mL), is fairly widespread, being found in a substantial percentage of
      healthy subjects around the world, regardless of race, gender and age. Daily
      vitamin D dose, as determined by the Food and Nutrition Board in 1997, is now
      rather insufficient, the biggest problem being associated with maximal vitamin D 
      levels (50 mug/day) in actually available food supplements. Nowadays, it is
      recommended that adults need a minimum of 800-1,000 U/day when their exposure to 
      the sun is inadequate (in Poland from October to April). This dosage should be
      provided to all subjects who avoid sunlight, as well as to those aged over 65
      because of their slower skin synthesis of vitamin D and for its proven
      anti-fracture and anti-fall effects.

TI  - Crohn's disease.
LID - 0416 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Crohn's disease is a chronic condition of the gastrointestinal
      tract. It is characterised by transmural, granulomatous inflammation that occurs 
      in a discontinuous pattern, with a tendency to form fistulae. The cause is
      unknown but may depend on interactions between genetic predisposition,
      environmental triggers, and mucosal immunity. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted 
      a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What
      are the effects of medical treatments to induce remission in adults with Crohn's 
      disease? What are the effects of surgical interventions to induce and maintain
      remission in adults with small-bowel Crohn's disease? What are the effects of
      surgical interventions to induce remission in adults with colonic Crohn's
      disease? What are the effects of medical interventions to maintain remission in
      adults with Crohn's disease; and to maintain remission following surgery? What
      are the effects of lifestyle interventions to maintain remission in adults with
      Crohn's disease? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other
      important databases up to December 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated
      periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this
      review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products
      Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 93 systematic reviews, RCTs, or
      observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: In this
      systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety
      of the following interventions: aminosalicylates, antibiotics,
      azathioprine/mercaptopurine, ciclosporin, corticosteroids (oral), enteral
      nutrition, fish oil, infliximab, methotrexate, probiotics, resection, segmental
      colectomy, smoking cessation, and strictureplasty.

PG  - 1022-9
AB  - THE AIM: The aim of this thesis was to elucidate more differences between a
      familial and sporadic inflammatory bowel disease by comparing certain clinical
      data. METHODS: We assessed 248 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      observed in 1994-2004 in the Academic Department of Gastroenterology at the
      Medical Faculty in Hradec Kralove. To get information about the defined
      characters we obtained from the questionary and the hospital data. RESULTS: We
      did not identify any relationship between the onset of the disease and a certain 
      age group, yet males seem to be more prone to familial Crohn's disease. The more 
      frequent familial form of Crohn's disease was the fibro-stenotic one. There were 
      no differences in the onset of the disease. We did not prove the differences in
      extraintestinal signs, alergy and comorbidities. We did not find any differences 
      in therapy response in relation to the type of nutrition (enteral, parenteral)
      and the administration of immunosupresive drugs. The biological therapy in
      sporadic and familial Crohn's disease did not differ either. Surgical
      intervention was more frequent in Crohn's patients compared to the patients with 
      ulcerative colitis; yet no difference was identified between familial and
      sporadic cases. Appendectomy carried out before the onset of the disease was
      later diagnosed as Crohn's disease in more instances than ulcerative colitis.
      CONCLUSION: We did not prove significant differences comparing certain clinical
      data in familial and sporadic form of inflammatory bowel disease, yet males seem 
      to be more prone to familial Crohn's disease. Small bowel was involved more often
      in familial form of Crohn's disease than in sporadic form.

TI  - Increased proteasome-mediated degradation of occludin in irritable bowel
      syndrome.
PG  - 1181-8
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2009.700 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Proteasome-mediated protein degradation may contribute to the
      regulation of intestinal inflammation. At the same time, low-grade inflammation
      and increased intestinal permeability seem to be involved in the pathophysiology 
      of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Thus, we aimed to evaluate proteasome
      composition and activities in colonic mucosa of IBS patients and its putative
      pathogenic role. METHODS: Proteasome activities and proteasome subunit expression
      were measured in colonic mucosa of IBS, Crohn's disease (CD), and control
      patients by fluorometric assays and western blot, respectively. Expression of
      inhibitor of kappa B factor (IkappaB alpha) and occludin, a tight junction
      protein, was also evaluated in colonic biopsies. The degradation of recombinant
      occludin incubated with protein extracts from colonic mucosa was evaluated in the
      presence or absence of proteasome inhibitor, MG132. RESULTS: Proteasome
      trypsin-like activity was increased in IBS patients compared with CD and
      controls, whereas chymotrypsin-like activity was upregulated in CD patients only.
      Caspase-like activity was reduced both in IBS and CD patients. IkappaB alpha
      expression was similar between IBS and controls. In contrast, occludin expression
      was lower in IBS than in controls, but occludin mRNA level was similar. Protein
      extracts from IBS patients but not from controls degraded recombinant occludin
      (20% over 160 min), which was blocked by MG132. Although mast cell number was
      increased in IBS patients, no correlation was found between this number and
      proteasome alterations. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that proteasome alterations 
      are present in the colonic mucosa of IBS patients and may contribute to the
      pathophysiology of IBS by increasing occludin degradation.

AB  - Of the individuals who present with Crohn's disease 25% are <18 years of age,
      mostly adolescent. Nutritional impairment and delayed growth are common at
      diagnosis and remain an issue during the disease course. Treatment has the
      primary aim to control symptoms, induce disease remission and achieve normal
      growth in the long term and includes nutritional support and early use of
      immunomodulation. Puberty may be discordant and is generally late and final adult
      height may not be achieved until the late teenage years. Chronic ill health and
      delayed growth may be accompanied by emotional and intellectual immaturity. These
      factors, including the varying rates of physical and emotional development, need 
      to be considered during adolescence with multidisciplinary input to ensure that
      the young patient is appropriately supported. Transition to adult care requires
      close collaboration between paediatric and healthcare teams with careful
      attention to nutritional, emotional and educational issues, all of which are
      relevant in the progression from childhood, through adolescence and to adult
      life.

PG  - 399-405
LID - 10.1007/s00535-009-0165-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poor bone acquisition and increased fracture risk are significant
      complications associated with Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this study was to 
      determine the effects of 8 weeks of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) therapy
      upon markers of bone turnover in children with newly diagnosed CD. METHODS:
      Twenty-three children with newly diagnosed CD and 20 controls (without CD) were
      enrolled. Children with CD were treated with 8 weeks of EEN. Inflammatory markers
      [C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), albumin,
      platelets], nutritional markers (height, weight), and bone markers [C-terminal
      telopeptides of Type-1 collagen (CTX) and bone specific alkaline phosphatase
      (BAP)] were measured prior to and following therapy. RESULTS: At diagnosis,
      children with CD had elevated serum CTX (2.967 +/- 0.881 ng/ml) compared to
      controls (2.059 +/- 0.568 ng/ml; P = 0.0003). Following the period of EEN, CTX
      levels fell significantly (2.260 +/- 0.547 ng/ml; P = 0.002), while serum BAP
      levels (51.24 +/- 31.31 microg/L at diagnosis; control serum BAP = 66.80 +/-
      23.23 microg/L; P = 0.07) increased significantly (64.82 +/- 30.51 microg/L; P = 
      0.02), with both normalizing to control levels. CONCLUSIONS: As well as reducing 
      inflammation, decreasing disease activity, and improving nutrition in children
      with newly diagnosed CD, EEN therapy also normalized serum markers of bone
      turnover, suggesting an improvement in bone health. Further investigations of
      short- and long-term effects of EEN on bone density and overall bone health are
      now required.

AB  - Pancreatitis has been described occasionally in association with Crohn's disease 
      in adults before, but it is uncommon in children. It may be caused by multiple
      etiologies, and there exist a few reports of pancreatitis in pediatric patients
      with inflammatory bowel disease because of biliary obstruction or drug induced.
      We report a rare case of a 14-year-old girl with Crohn's disease and
      hypoparathyroidism who suffered from hemorrhagic necrotizing pancreatitis with
      development of huge psyeudocysts, a life-threatening complication that required
      surgical treatment.

AB  - Crohn disease often recurs after surgical resection. Despite extensive research
      in the prevention of postoperative Crohn disease, optimal management strategies
      have yet to be defined. Risk of disease recurrence needs to be carefully balanced
      against potential risks associated with treatment. Patients with low risk of
      postoperative recurrence may not require medication, whereas those at moderate
      risk may benefit from antibiotics or immunomodulators. Those at highest risk of
      recurrence may benefit from biologic therapy for maintenance of surgical
      remission. Postoperative colonoscopy within 1 year of resective surgery is
      important for identification of disease recurrence and modification of
      medications.

AB  - There has been a continual evolution of therapy for Crohn's disease (CD) over the
      past decade since the introduction of biological therapies targeting tumor
      necrosis factor-alpha. Conventional agents continue to be safe and effective for 
      patients with mild to moderately active CD and, in population series, less than
      half of the patients with CD require corticosteroid therapy. In contrast,
      patients presenting at young ages, those with extensive disease, deep
      ulcerations, transmural complications or extraintestinal complications that
      require corticosteroid therapy have a poor prognosis. Introduction of
      immunosuppressives late in the course or for patients with steroid-dependent or
      steroid-refractory disease have not changed the 'natural history' of CD or the
      need for eventual surgical resections. There is increasing evidence that early
      intervention with immunosuppressives or biologic agents at the same time as
      corticosteroids, or biologic agents targeting tumor necrosis factor or adhesion
      molecules, can have rapid and prolonged benefits, including steroid sparing,
      reductions in hospitalizations and, perhaps, reductions in the need for surgery. 
      Treatment should be optimized according to the patient status and response with
      whichever level of therapy is introduced and maintained.

TI  - Anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha-loaded microspheres as a prospective novel
      treatment for Crohn's disease fistulae.
PG  - 855-64
LID - 10.1089/ten.TEC.2009.0599 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Antibodies to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) have
      been successful in treating perianal fistulae in Crohn's disease, but current
      modes of delivery are limited. Microspheres are currently being assessed as
      scaffolds for tissue engineering and drug delivery devices. The aim of this study
      was to produce anti-TNF-alpha antibody-encapsulated microspheres using thermally 
      induced phase separation (TIPS) and to characterize their behavior. METHODS:
      Anti-TNF-alpha antibody was encapsulated into the microspheres (100 mg
      infliximab/g poly[lactide-co-glycolide] w/w) using a novel technique combining a 
      vibration encapsulator unit with a TIPS process, using either lyophilized
      particulate antibody or an aqueous solution of antibody. Microspheres were
      incubated in phosphate-buffered saline for collection of supernatant and
      assessment of degradation. The amount and biological activity of the encapsulated
      antibody released from the microspheres was assessed by enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay and its ability to neutralize recombinant human (rh)TNF-alpha
      in vitro with a cytotoxicity assay. An in vitro wound scratch assay was used to
      assess the effect of released antibody on fibroblast migration. Ultrastructural
      characteristics of the different microspheres were characterized by scanning
      electron microscopy. RESULTS: Highly porous microspheres released anti-TNF-alpha 
      antibody under zero-order kinetics and inhibited the cytotoxic activity of
      rhTNF-alpha, producing a significant increase in cell viability compared with
      cells treated with rhTNF-alpha alone. This effect was most pronounced with
      microspheres fabricated by blending lyophilized particulate anti-TNF-alpha
      antibody into the polymer solution, which also significantly reduced the release 
      of lactate dehydrogenase. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS: Anti-TNF-alpha antibody
      encapsulated into highly porous microspheres was released in a controlled manner 
      and exhibited biological activity against TNF-alpha. The technique used to
      produce TIPS microspheres is rapid and provides high encapsulation efficiency.
      This technique could also be applied to other therapeutic peptides where rapid
      fabrication and high yields are required.

AB  - : affecting sphincter integrity and continence. Traditional surgical and medical 
      approaches are not without their limitations and may result in either
      comorbidity, such as fecal incontinence, or incomplete healing of the fistulae.
      Over the last 2 decades these limitations have led to a paradigm shift toward the
      use of biomaterials, and more recently cell-based therapies, which have met with 
      variable degrees of success. This review discusses the traditional and current
      methods of treatment, as well as emerging and possible alternative approaches
      that may improve fistula healing.

      disease.
PG  - 953-61
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21152 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Childhood-onset Crohn's disease (CD) might reflect a more severe form
      of disease. To test this hypothesis we analyzed the long-term natural history of 
      CD in an adult cohort of patients with childhood-onset compared to adult-onset
      CD. METHODS: We selected 206 childhood-onset CD patients among 2992 adult
      patients with a diagnosis of CD established before December 31, 2000. Disease
      characteristics were prospectively assessed during follow-up until December 2007 
      and compared to adult-onset CD patients matched 2 to 1 on gender, year of CD
      diagnosis, and disease location. RESULTS: Compared to adult-onset CD, patients
      with childhood-onset CD were more likely to have a severe disease, with an
      increased year-by-year disease activity index (37% of patient-years in
      childhood-onset group versus 31% in the adult-onset group, P < 0.001).
      Immunosuppressant requirement was also increased with a 10-year cumulative risk
      of 54 +/- 3% in childhood-onset CD group versus 45 +/- 2%, in the adult-onset CD 
      group (P < 0.001). Cumulative risks of stricturing and penetrating complications 
      and surgical resections were not statistically different between groups.
      Accordingly, these events occurred at a younger age in the childhood-onset CD
      group. At the age of 30 years the actuarial risk of having undergone an extensive
      intestinal resection was 48 +/- 5% in the childhood-onset group versus 14 +/- 2% 
      in the adult-onset group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with childhood-onset 
      CD exhibit a more active disease and require more immunosuppressive therapy. This
      feature is observed irrespective of the disease location, suggesting an intrinsic
      more severe phenotype.

AB  - In the course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) a number of extraintestinal
      manifestations are known to occur, being the dermatological ones often associated
      to both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Pyoderma gangrenosum and erythema
      nodosum are the most frequent, but there are other skin manifestations less
      frequently reported such as leukocytoclastic vasculitis. We present a case, in
      which Crohn's disease and leukocytoclastic vasculitis were simultaneously
      diagnosed, and corticoids treatment achieved complete remission of the both
      cutaneous and gastrointestinal manifestations.

AB  - Crohn's disease (CD), a form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), provides a
      complex model of host-microbe interactions underpinning disease pathogenesis.
      Although there is not widespread agreement on the etiology of CD, there is
      evidence that microorganisms lead to the often severe inflammatory response
      characteristic of the disease. Despite several microbial candidates, no specific 
      microbe has been considered pathogenic. Instead, the concept of the 'pathogenic
      community' has emerged from the evidence, whereby the stability of the microbial 
      ecosystem of the healthy human gut is disrupted in response to host genetics and 
      destabilized immunity, perhaps through changing public health practices leading
      to altered microbial exposures over time. We discuss the complex microbial
      ecosystem of the mammalian gut, the underlying genetic factors that predispose to
      CD, and how these gene variants may alter host-microbe interactions and propagate
      inflammation. Over the next 5 years, the increased understanding of genes
      involved in CD and the way in which individuals with variants of these genes
      respond differently to nutrients and drugs will enable the rational development
      of personalized therapies, using pharmacogenomic and nutrigenomic approaches.

AB  - PURPOSE: Hitherto, the efficacy of enteral nutrition (EN) on clinical outcomes
      during biological maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease (CD) has not been
      investigated. This prospective study was to assess the efficacy of EN on the
      maintenance rate of clinical remission in patients with quiescent CD receiving
      infliximab as maintenance therapy. METHODS: Fifty-six patients who achieved
      clinical remission with infliximab induction therapy received infliximab as
      maintenance therapy (5 mg/kg, every 8 weeks). Thirty-two of the 56 patients
      received concomitant EN: elemental diet infusion during night-time and a low fat 
      diet during daytime (EN group), while the remaining 24 patients received neither 
      nutritional therapy nor food restriction (non-EN group). All patients were
      followed for 56 weeks; CD activity index (CDAI) was assessed and CDAI < 150 was
      defined as clinical remission. RESULTS: During the 56-week observation, the mean 
      CDAI was not significantly different between the 2 groups. Seven patients in the 
      EN group ceased EN therapy because they maintained complete remission. On an
      intention-to-treat basis, 25 patients in the EN group (78%) and 16 patients in
      the non-EN group (67%) remained in clinical remission during the 56-week
      observation (P = 0.51). CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes of this prospective study
      showed that concomitant EN during infliximab maintenance therapy does not
      significantly increase the maintenance rate of clinical remission in patients
      with CD.

      disease.

LID - 10.1159/000228564 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Exclusive enteral nutrition has been used over many years as a
      therapy to try and achieve a remission in adults and children presenting with
      acute Crohn's disease. Despite its reported efficacy at achieving clinical
      responses in excess of 80% in some case series, it has not been taken up widely
      as a first-line therapy. This is, at least in part, due to the lack of a large
      prospective randomised study. METHODS: The literature is replete with small case 
      series and anecdotal reports from units who use this therapy. Recent literature
      is reviewed on efficacy, application, composition and potential mechanisms of
      action of this therapy. RESULTS: Although the evidence base remains quite
      limited, further data are available that suggest a clear benefit of exclusive
      enteral nutrition as an efficacious alternative to steroid therapy at inducing a 
      clinical remission in Crohn's disease. Certain sub-groups are likely to benefit
      more, with potential benefits on growth making it particularly useful in
      adolescents and growing young adults. Given the lack of side effects compared to 
      the alternative of steroid therapy, along with the clear nutritional benefits of 
      this therapy, it remains an obvious choice for patients presenting with Crohn's
      disease and a degree of malnutrition. CONCLUSIONS: This therapy should remain a
      first-line therapy for children and adults presenting with mild to moderate
      Crohn's disease.

TI  - Risk/benefit strategies must be employed in the management of pediatric Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 291-6
LID - 10.1159/000228563 [doi]
AB  - Clinicians caring for children with Crohn's disease must consider the long-term
      implications of therapeutic interventions and cumulative diagnostic studies in
      their patients whose disease duration will be measured in decades. There is
      evidence of the increased severity of pediatric Crohn's disease compared to its
      adult counterpart, its frequent co-morbid growth disturbances, and the frequent
      need for aggressive medical therapies including immunomodulators and biological
      agents. The initial management of most children diagnosed with Crohn's disease
      involves enteral nutritional support, corticosteroids, and immunomodulators.
      Corticosteroids, while initially helpful in decreasing signs and symptoms of
      disease, are occasionally ineffective, generally do not heal mucosa, impair
      growth, and are frequently associated with a state of corticosteroid dependency. 
      Immunomodulators are effective maintenance therapies with corticosteroid sparing 
      effects, but have no value in the acutely ill child. The emergence of biological 
      therapy with its impressive record of rapid efficacy and use as maintenance
      therapy has prompted discussion of its incorporation into initial management, but
      has also raised concerns about who are the most suitable candidates, which if any
      medications can be used concomitantly, and long-term safety. The combined use of 
      thiopurines and anti-TNF agents may predispose to a rare and uniformly fatal
      lymphoma. Identification of children at high risk for complicated disease may
      allow us to better evaluate risk/benefit in newly diagnosed children, and
      biologic agents are likely to assume an increasing role in primary therapy in
      those deemed at highest risk. Long-term observations will determine whether
      biologics will change natural history and demonstrate adequate safety.

AB  - The clinical manifestations of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)
      are highly variable, with significant diversity in phenotypes of the diseases.
      This diversity may manifest as a difference in age of onset. Pediatric-onset
      disease may present differently and have a different natural history, with
      ramifications for disease management. Clear evidence exists at present that
      pediatric-onset UC may be different than adult-onset UC. The primary difference
      in disease phenotype is extent of disease. Approximately 60-70% of patients with 
      pediatric-onset UC present with pancolitis, as opposed to approximately 20-30% in
      adults. Patients are more likely to have severe disease and become
      steroid-dependent. CD may be affected by an age gradient. There is an inverse
      linear relationship between age and colonic CD, the younger the patient, the more
      likely is the patient to have colonic CD. This inverse relationship is true
      through age 10. In addition, pediatric patients are more likely to have upper
      gastrointestinal involvement than their adult peers. Comparing adult and
      pediatric phenotypes is fraught with methodological obstacles. Disease behavior, 
      with the exception of growth failure, seems to parallel disease behavior in
      adults. Patients with growth retardation are a high risk group for complications 
      and should be managed as such.

AB  - The knowledge of the outcome among patients receiving placebo is important for
      evaluating the response to therapy, for evaluating the natural history of a
      disease and for calculating the sample size for future clinical trials. In
      Crohn's disease placebo has been used in therapeutic trials in every relevant
      setting: active disease, prevention of relapse after induced medical remission
      and after surgery and fistulising disease. The analysis of the placebo response
      shows that in every setting there is a high heterogeneity demonstrating mainly
      that the selection of patients is not often homogeneous and that the outcome
      criteria used in the trials is not highly reliable. Better selection of patients 
      and more precise definition of outcome measures are warranted to reduce the
      heterogeneity among placebo response in clinical trials.

TI  - [Therapeutic effects of combined enteral nutrition with Tripterygium Wilfordii
      poly-glycoside in remission induction of active adult Crohn's disease].
PG  - 1213-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential role of enteral nutrition (EN) combined
      with Tripterygium Wilfordii Poly-glycoside (TWP) for remission induction of
      active adult Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: Clinical data of 62 adult patients
      with active CD treated with EN and TWP in combination (n = 42) or TWP alone (n = 
      20) from March 2001 to September 2008 were retrospectively analyzed. All the
      patients had a Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) > 150 and < 450. In TWP
      group, subjects received TWP tablets (1.0 - 1.5 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) with
      uncontrolled diets; while in the group of combination therapy, the patients were 
      given total enteral nutrition (TEN) through tube feeding in addition to TWP
      tablets. Clinical response was defined by a decrease of at least 70 points in the
      CDAI from baseline after treatment, and clinical remission was defined as the
      absolute value of CDAI (less than 150). Patients' nutritional and disease
      activity index, such as CDAI score, C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate (ESR), were determined at 0, 4, and 12 weeks after treatment. 
      RESULTS: The ratio of clinical response (78.6% vs. 40.0%, P = 0.003) and clinical
      remission (69.1% vs. 30.0%, P = 0.004) were both significantly higher in the
      combined treatment group than in those the TWP group at week 4. At week 12, the
      clinical response ratio was significantly higher in the combined treatment group 
      (90.5% vs. 65.0%, P = 0.014); the remission ratio was also higher in the combined
      treatment group (76.2% vs. 55.0%, P = 0.091). The nutritional parameters improved
      from baseline at week 4 and 12 in the combined treatment group but not in TWP
      group. At week 4, blood albumin, prealbumin, and transferrin levels was higher in
      the combined treatment group than those in TWP group (P < 0.05); at week 12,
      patients in combined treatment group also had significantly higher body mass
      index (BMI), blood albumin, prealbumin, transferrin and hemoglobin levels (P <
      0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with enteral nutrition and TWP in combination are
      superior to TWP alone for induction of clinical response and remission in adult
      Crohn's Disease. This strategy also improves patient's nutritional status and
      avoids the adverse effects of traditional therapy.

TI  - [A case of disseminated BCG infection found during treatment of an infant with
      Crohn's disease].
PG  - 597-603
AB  - Bloody stools, diarrhea and perianal abscesses were observed from the age of two 
      months infant. The boy received a BCG vaccination at the age of four months. The 
      patient was diagnosed as having Crohn's disease at the age of six months by
      intestinal endoscopy. Based on the diagnosis, he was treated with nutrition
      therapy, salazosulfapyridine, and prednisolone. Fever of unknown origin occurred 
      two months after he had taken azathioprine at the age of two years and two
      months. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was detected from a gastric aspirate, and he
      was diagnosed as having disseminated BCG infection by means of the multiplex PCR 
      method. Chest CT showed miliary pulmonary nodules in both lungs on admission.
      Physical examination revealed enlarged lymphnodes, which were palpable around the
      neck and groin, and hepatomegaly. Laboratory data were within normal ranges
      except a slightly increased peripheral white blood cell and serum CRP level. He
      was treated with rifampicin (15 mg/kg/day), isoniazid (15 mg/kg/day) for 12
      months, and streptomycin (25 mg/kg/day) for two months. He became afebrile a week
      after starting the treatment, and the miliary pulmonary nodules in both lungs had
      disappeared by 5 months after starting the treatment. An abnormality of the NEMO 
      gene, which is the gene responsible for ectodermal dysplasia and
      immunodeficiency, was identified at the age of three years. It is assumed that an
      abnormality of the NEMO gene caused a latent BCG infection over a period of one
      year and ten months, and immunosuppressive medicine (azathioprine) induced a
      disseminated BCG infection. This case report supports that anti-tuberculosis
      medicine should be given to prevent disseminated BCG infection if an infant who
      receive immunosuppressive therapy is found to have an immune deficiency
      characterized by a mycobacterium infection after BCG vaccination.

TI  - Relationship between nutritional therapy and surgery in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1044-8
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Crohn's disease is often refractory and some patients require
      repeated surgical treatment. Nutritional therapy with an elemental diet has been 
      reported effective in improving nutritional state and suppressing inflammation,
      and might be expected to assist in minimizing the need for surgery. We evaluated 
      the relationship between an elemental diet and the period that patients spent
      without intestinal resection. METHODOLOGY: A total of 153 patients with Crohn's
      disease who visited our hospital from July, 1999 to July, 2005 were enrolled. The
      relationship between the caloric content of an elemental diet and surgery as an
      endpoint was examined using Cox regression analysis. Cumulative non-operation
      rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical significance was
      determined using the log-rank test. RESULTS: Among patients with jejunoileal
      involvement, patients receiving an elemental diet providing 900 kcal or more per 
      day showed a statistically significant improvement in cumulative non-operation
      rate. Among those without jejunoileal involvement, in contrast, the cumulative
      non-operation rate did not differ among those receiving an elemental diet of less
      or more than 900 kcal per day. CONCLUSIONS: The use of an elemental diet of 900
      kcal per day may be effective in avoiding surgery in patients with jejunoileal
      lesions. This diet may be useful in improving long-term convalescence in these
      patients.

TI  - Environmental factors in the development of chronic inflammation: a case-control 
      study on risk factors for Crohn's disease within New Zealand.
PG  - 116-22
LID - 10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2009.09.002 [doi]
AB  - The role of environmental factors in the risk for Crohn's disease (CD), an
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), was investigated in a North Island-based New
      Zealand case-control cohort. A total of 315 CD patients and 536 controls were
      recruited through various sources to the Auckland CD Risk Factor Study. As well
      as demographic characteristics, the self-reported questionnaire included (1)
      smoking and drinking alcohol, (2) breastfeeding in infancy, (3) early life
      exposures to allergens and microbes, (4) health conditions lasting 6 months or
      longer and (5) taking antibiotics and any medications. There was strong evidence 
      for familial associations of the disease, and minor effects of birth order and
      number of siblings. Being a smoker, especially over a long time period, and
      exposure to smoking during childhood and adolescence periods increased risk,
      whereas drinking alcohol at least once per week showed a slight protective
      effect. Long term use of the oral contraceptive pill increased the risk of
      developing CD, but breastfeeding and immunisation during infancy showed no
      significant association. Long term and debilitating illness (lasting 6 months or 
      more), taking antibiotics prior to developing CD, or taking four or more
      antibiotics or any regular medication in a year during adolescence substantially 
      increased the CD risk. Having a pet during childhood was a protective factor, but
      regularly feeding an animal was not sufficient to protect. Many of these
      significant factors are likely to impact on the colonic microflora and/or immune 
      system. We conclude that, in addition to strong evidence for genetic
      associations, factors likely to impact on immune response or reduce early
      exposure to microbes provide a main risk factor for CD in this New Zealand
      population.

      administration].
PG  - 1364-9
AB  - A 19-year old man was admitted for treatment of a right psoas abscess. He was
      first diagnosed as Crohn's disease with ileocolitis and fistula, which caused the
      abscess. Following the drainage of the abscess and conservative treatment
      including administration of antibiotics, total parenteral nutrition and
      medication, his symptoms were temporarily improved. After recurrence, additional 
      therapy with infliximab successfully induced remission. He has remained free from
      abdominal symptoms and recurrence of the abscess. It seems that conservative
      treatment including infliximab administration is useful for induction as well as 
      maintenance of remission and avoiding surgical treatment.

TI  - Mechanisms of growth impairment in pediatric Crohn's disease.
PG  - 513-23
LID - 10.1038/nrgastro.2009.124 [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease manifests during childhood or adolescence in up to 25% of
      patients. The potential for linear growth impairment as a complication of chronic
      intestinal inflammation is unique to pediatric patient populations. Insulin-like 
      growth factor I (IGF-I), produced by the liver in response to growth hormone (GH)
      stimulation, is the key mediator of GH effects at the growth plate of bones. An
      association between impaired growth in children with Crohn's disease and low
      IGF-I levels is well recognized. Early studies emphasized the role of
      malnutrition in suppression of IGF-I production. However, a simple nutritional
      hypothesis fails to explain all the observations related to growth in children
      with Crohn's disease. The direct, growth-inhibitory effects of proinflammatory
      cytokines are increasingly recognized and explored. The potential role of
      noncytokine factors, such as lipopolysaccharides, and their potential to
      negatively influence the growth axis have recently been investigated with
      intriguing results. There is now reason for optimism that the modern anticytokine
      therapeutic agents available for treating children and adolescents with Crohn's
      disease will reduce the prevalence of this otherwise common complication. As our 
      understanding of the mechanisms that underlie growth impairment advance, so too
      should the opportunity for developing further novel and targeted therapies.

TI  - Enteral nutrition for the maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease: a
      systematic review.
PG  - 1-8
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0b013e32832c788c [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This review study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of enteral
      nutrition (EN) for the maintenance of remission in patients with Crohn's disease 
      (CD) who achieved medically or surgically induced remission. METHODS: The
      Medline, Embase, Ovid, and Cochrane database search of literature was carried out
      to identify studies that reported the efficacy of EN for the maintenance of
      remission in CD. The main outcome measure was the occurrence of clinical or
      endoscopic relapse. RESULTS: Ten studies were included: one randomized controlled
      trial, three prospective non-randomized trials, and six retrospective studies.
      Elemental, semielemental or polymeric diets were used as an oral supplement or a 
      nocturnal tube feeding in addition to ordinary foods. Comparing outcomes between 
      patients who received EN and those who did not, the clinical remission rate was
      significantly higher in those with EN in all seven studies. In two studies, EN
      showed suppressive effects on endoscopic disease activity. In all four studies
      investigating impacts of the quantity of enteral formula on clinical remission,
      higher amounts of enteral formula were associated with higher remission rates: > 
      or =30 kcal/kg ideal body weight/day (vs. <30 kcal/kg ideal body weight/day), >
      or =1200 kcal/day (vs. <1200 kcal/day), and > or =1600 kcal/day (vs. <1600
      kcal/day). Quantitative pooling of studies was not feasible because of the
      diversity of interventions and outcome measures among the studies. CONCLUSION:
      Although the evidence level is not high, the available data suggest that EN may
      be useful for maintaining remission in patients with CD. Large randomized
      controlled trials are necessary to assess a definite efficacy of EN for the
      maintenance of remission.

TI  - Response to medical treatment in patients with Crohn's disease: the role of
      NOD2/CRAD15, disease phenotype, and age of diagnosis.
PG  - 1674-80
LID - 10.1007/s10620-009-0936-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Factors influencing response to medications in Crohn's disease (CD)
      patients are not fully understood. We aimed to evaluate the relationships between
      NOD2/CARD15 mutations, disease phenotype and age of CD diagnosis and response to 
      medical treatment with systemic steroids, azathioprine (AZA) or 6-mercaptopurine 
      (6-MP), and infliximab. METHODS: A retrospective medical records analysis was
      made of patients previously tested for the CD-associated NOD2/CARD15 mutations.
      Harvey- Bradshaw score was used to assess remission or response to therapy.
      RESULTS: CD-associated NOD2/CARD15 mutations were not related to the rate of
      steroids dependency or clinical response to AZA/6-MP and infliximab. Steroid
      dependency was associated with colonic involvement. Thirty-three of 127 (26%)
      patients with colonic disease were steroid dependent, compared with 7/72 (9.7%)
      patients with isolated small bowel disease (ISBD), (p = 0.009). ISBD was mildly
      associated with a better remission/response to AZA/6-MP treatment. Disease
      behavior and age of diagnosis were not related to response to therapy.
      CONCLUSIONS: Response to treatment with systemic steroids, AZA/6-MP and
      infliximab are not related to NOD2/CARD15 mutations, age of diagnosis and disease
      behavior. Patients with colonic disease have higher rates of steroid dependency.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Randomized, placebo controlled trials are used to assess the efficacy
      of therapies for Crohn's disease. The placebo response and remission rates vary
      among studies. AIM: To analyse how the placebo response and remission rates in
      Crohn's trials have changed over time in the era of parenteral biologic
      therapies. METHODS: A search for randomized, placebo-controlled trials of
      parenteral biologic therapies for active Crohn's disease was conducted using
      online databases. The placebo response and remission rates and study week of
      evaluation were recorded for each trial. The placebo response and remission rates
      were analysed as functions of publication date and study week of evaluation.
      RESULTS: The odds of a placebo-induced remission and response significantly
      increased as the week of evaluation increased. The placebo remission rate
      increased significantly with year of publication. Adjusted for week of
      evaluation, this increase in placebo remission rate over time was no longer
      significant. The increase in the placebo response over this time period was not
      statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The observed increase in placebo remission
      rates over time in trials of parenteral biologic therapies in Crohn's disease is 
      explained by longer times to the primary endpoint in more recent trials.

PG  - 400-4
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181a0d269 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rifaximin, Food and Drug Administration approved for traveler's
      diarrhea, has been used in adult patients with active inflammatory bowel disease 
      (IBD). This retrospective review was undertaken to determine its role in the
      treatment of pediatric IBD. METHODS: A review of children with IBD, who were
      treated with rifaximin from 2005 to 2007 at our institution, was performed.
      Collected data included diagnosis, age, medication history, recent therapy,
      symptom, and interval to improvement. Response was rated as none, moderate, or
      optimum relief for each symptom. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were identified, 
      12 with Crohn disease and 11 with ulcerative colitis (UC) with a median age of 13
      years. The most common complaints were diarrhea in 20 patients (87%), abdominal
      pain in 17 (74%), and bloody stools in 15 (65%). Rifaximin was given at doses
      ranging between 10 and 30 mg/kg (Table 1). Of the 20 patients who presented with 
      diarrhea 5 (25%) had relief of diarrhea within 1 week of starting rifaximin and
      total of 12 patients (60%) experienced relief within 4 weeks. Abdominal pain
      resolved in 3 of 17 patients (17.6%) within 1 week and in 12 of 17 (70.6%) within
      4 weeks. Visible bleeding resolved in 10 of 15 patients (66.7%) within 4 weeks of
      therapy (Table 2). Analysis of concurrent medications showed 61% experienced
      relief of symptoms when addition of rifaximin was the only meaningful treatment
      change. CONCLUSIONS: Rifaximin was well-tolerated and showed favorable results.
      Larger doses of rifaximin were statistically better for abdominal pain. Further
      studies are needed to evaluate efficacy and optimal dosing of rifaximin in this
      population.

TI  - Mushroom intolerance: a novel diet-gene interaction in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 506-8
LID - 10.1017/S0007114509276446 [doi]
AB  - Carrying a functional single nucleotide polymorphism (L503F, c. 1672 C>T) in the 
      gene for the Na-dependent organic cation transporter (OCTN1), increases the risk 
      of Crohn's disease (CD) in some, but not all, populations. Case-control data on
      New Zealand Caucasians show no differences for CD risk between individuals
      carrying the L503F OCTN1 C-allele when compared with those carrying the variant
      T-allele. However, more of the New Zealand CD cases report intolerance to maize
      and mushrooms than those who report beneficial effects or no differences. The
      OCTN1 gene encodes a transporter for ergothionine, a fungal metabolite at high
      levels in mushrooms but not widely common in other dietary items. An inability to
      tolerate mushrooms showed statistically significant associations with the variant
      OCTN1 genotype. That is, among those individuals reporting adverse effects from
      mushrooms, there was a higher frequency of the variant T-allele when compared
      with the general population, or with CD patients overall. We believe that this is
      a novel gene-diet association, suggesting that individuals carrying the OCTN1
      variant single nucleotide polymorphism may have an enhanced risk of adverse
      symptoms associated with consuming mushrooms. Nutrigenomic approaches to dietary 
      recommendations may be appropriate in this group.

LID - 10.1016/j.nut.2009.06.011 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consists of two main disorders, ulcerative
      colitis and Crohn's disease, that cause chronic, recurrent inflammation of the
      intestine. An inappropriate immune response to the enteric ecosystem has been
      postulated to cause IBD. Genomewide association studies provide the information
      of diverse genetic variations and susceptibilities to patients with IBD. Through 
      the application of these studies, the pathogenesis of IBD may result in part from
      genetic abnormalities that regulate epithelial barrier function and innate and
      adaptive immune responses. Crohn's disease shows strong association with CARD15, 
      ATG15L1, and IRGM, which are involved in the innate immunity. In the adaptive
      immune response, IL23R, MST1, IL12B, and STAT3 polymorphisms are associated with 
      Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Current pharmacologic treatment of IBD,
      including 5-aminosalycylate, steroids, and immunomodulator therapy, are mainly
      aimed at suppressing inflammation non-specifically, except biologic therapies
      such as anti-tumor necrosis factor molecule, which block specific proinflammatory
      molecules. For nutritional issues in IBD, the mainstay of therapy has been
      supportive, with particular attention paid to the prevention, recognition, and
      therapy of nutritional deficiencies, and individual outcomes to specific dietary 
      factors have been controversial. Parenteral nutritional support and exclusionary 
      diets have been investigated and are not the subject of this review. The emerging
      concepts of nutrition-gene interaction gave birth to unique scientific fields,
      nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics. These studies provide information about 1) the
      genetic variability that induces an individual's response to nutrition according 
      to particular states of health and disease and 2) changes in gene expression that
      develop as a result of nutrition-gene interaction. For IBD, the role of diet in
      the regulation of the immune response against gut flora is the subject of current
      intensive evaluation. These approaches may lead clinicians to derive a
      personalized nutritional prescription based on individual genetic variations and 
      may result in a significant impact on IBD treatment.

TI  - Endoscopic ultrasound to guide the combined medical and surgical management of
      pediatric perianal Crohn's disease.
PG  - 461-8
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21067 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Perianal fistulas are a debilitating manifestation of Crohn's disease
      (CD) in the pediatric population and present a management challenge. The aims of 
      this study were to describe our experience using endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) to
      guide management of perianal CD (PCD) in a pediatric population, and determine
      whether using EUS to monitor healing after seton placement improves outcomes.
      METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 2 cohorts: pediatric subjects with
      PCD who underwent EUS and pediatric subjects who underwent seton placement
      between 2002 and 2007. RESULTS: In all, 25 children underwent a total of 42 EUS
      procedures. Of 28 EUSs performed to evaluate suspected perianal disease, complex 
      fistulizing disease was identified in 15 (54%). Setons were placed after most
      EUSs demonstrating complex fistulizing disease and after none demonstrating
      superficial or no fistulizing disease. Of 14 EUSs performed to monitor healing
      around a seton, 7 (50%) demonstrated persistent peri-seton inflammation. Setons
      were more often left in place after an EUS revealing persistent inflammation (86%
      versus 0%), and the patients were more likely to have a biologic initiated or
      changed (57% versus 0%). Among all subjects who underwent seton placement, time
      from seton removal to recurrence was longer for those followed by EUS compared to
      those followed by physical exam only; however, we were not powered to test for
      statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: EUS to guide the combined medical and
      surgical management of PCD is feasible in the pediatric population. Larger
      prospective studies are needed to determine if EUS-directed management improves
      outcomes in pediatric patients with PCD.

TI  - Plexitis as a predictive factor of early postoperative clinical recurrence in
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1218-25
LID - 10.1136/gut.2009.177782 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A previous study suggested that the presence of myenteric
      plexitis in the proximal resection margins could be predictive of early
      endoscopic recurrence after ileocolonic or ileal resection for Crohn's disease
      (CD). The aim of the present study was to assess the predictive value of plexitis
      for early clinical CD recurrence. METHODS: All consecutive patients with
      ileocolonic or ileal resection for active CD in Lariboisiere Hospital (Paris)
      between 1995 and 2006 were included. Clinical, surgical, histological and
      follow-up data were extracted from medical charts. Early clinical recurrence was 
      defined as the reappearance of CD clinical manifestations requiring a specific
      treatment within 2 years postsurgery. The proximal resection margin was analysed 
      using haematein eosin saffron (HES) staining and immunochemistry targeting
      mastocytes (anti-CD117 antibody) and lymphocytes (anti-CD3 antibody). Eosinophils
      were detected by HES staining. Ten cases of ileocolonic resections for caecal
      carcinoma served as controls. RESULTS: Data were available from 171 postoperative
      follow-up periods in 164 patients with CD. Early clinical recurrence of CD
      occurred in 28.1%. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with
      postoperative recurrence were active smoking (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.94; 95% CI
      1.06 to 3.60; p = 0.033), submucosal plexitis with >or=3 mastocytes (HR = 1.87;
      95% CI 1.00 to 3.46; p = 0.048) and a disease-free resection margin <5 cm (HR =
      0.52; 95% CI 0.27 to 1.02; p = 0.059). CONCLUSIONS: Submucosal plexitis is
      associated with early clinical recurrence and could be taken into account in
      studies searching for new treatment strategies in the immediate postoperative
      period.

      disease].
PG  - 161-6
LID - S0212-16112009000200009 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: to determine the rate of malnutrition in patients with Crohn's
      disease in our area (Substudy A). We assess in long-term the response of
      malnourished patients to treatment of nutritional supplement with TGF-beta2
      (Substudy B). SUBJECTS: ninety-eight (51% females) patients with Crohn's disease 
      without selection, ages: 39.2 +/- 15.19 years, range: 18-81 years were included
      in Substudy A. In Substudy B thirty-nine malnourished patients (52% females) were
      included with an average age of 36.41 +/- 5.2 years and range: 19-45 (Substudy
      B). METHODS: the design of the Substudy A was an observational and cross
      sectional study. Whereas, the Substudy B was a longitudinal, open intervention
      study with active (historical) control. The variables were anthropometric
      parameters, electrical bioimpedance, biochemical measures, index of disease
      activity, subjective global assessment and the kind of treatment that every
      patient has received. MAIN RESULTS: the malnutrition rate was 52%, being the most
      frequent the caloric malnutrition, followed by mixed malnutrition. Thirty four
      per cent of the patients had iron deficiency. Twelve months of nutritional
      therapy with supplement specifically enriched in TGF-beta2 improved the evolution
      of the disease determined by a decrease in CDAI. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of
      malnutrition was similar to that of previous studies realized in Spain. Our study
      confirms the high rate of iron deficiency that the patients suffer with Crohn's
      disease. The response to the treatment is favorable, especially regarding the
      natural history of the disease.

TI  - Enteral nutrition improves health-related quality of life in Crohn's disease
      patients with long disease duration.
PG  - 321-7
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Although enteral nutrition therapy has been highlighted as
      maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease, few reports have investigated the impact
      of enteral nutrition on the health-related quality of life of Crohn's disease
      patients. METHODOLOGY: We cross-sectionally evaluated the effect of multiple
      clinical factors including enteral nutrition on the health-related quality of
      life of Crohn's disease patients focusing on patient disease duration using the
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire. RESULTS: Of all 126 patients examined, 
      95 patients were receiving enteral nutrition. Multiple linear regression analysis
      using 18 clinical parameters revealed that disease activity was a dominant factor
      that affected the health-related quality of life of Crohn's disease patients, and
      that enteral nutrition was also an independent factor that improved the
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire total score, bowel symptoms, and
      systemic symptoms for patients with a disease duration of 10 years or more (P =
      0.0090, 0.0033, and 0.016, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Enteral nutrition improved
      the health-related quality of life of Crohn's disease patients with long-term
      disease duration. Thus, enteral nutrition should be recommended as one of the
      options for maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease.

TI  - Potential for amino acids supplementation during inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 518-24
LID - 10.1002/ibd.21017 [doi]
AB  - The pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) is multifactorial and
      involves interactions of gut luminal content with mucosal barrier and especially 
      immune cells. Malnutrition is a frequent issue during IBD flares, especially in
      Crohn's disease (CD) patients, and nutritional support is frequently used to
      treat malnutrition but also in an attempt to modulate intestinal inflammation.
      The use of oral or enteral nutrition intervention in IBDs may be effective, alone
      or in combination with drugs, to achieve and maintain remission. However,
      standard diets are less effective than new-generation biotherapies and could be
      improved by supplementation with specific immunomodulatory amino acids.
      Experimental studies evaluating glutamine, the preferential substrate for
      enterocytes, are promising. Some clinical studies with oral glutamine in CD are
      until now disappointing, but new formulations and targeting could enhance
      glutamine efficacy at the site of mucosal lesions. The role of arginine, involved
      in nitric oxide and polyamines synthesis, still remains debated. However, the
      effects of these amino acids in IBD have been poorly documented in humans. Other 
      candidates like glycine, cysteine, histidine, or taurine should also be evaluated
      in the future.

TI  - [Effects of perioperative combined nutritional support in Crohn disease].
PG  - 275-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the efficacy of perioperative combined nutritional support 
      in patients with Crohn disease. METHODS: From January 2000 to June 2008, 165
      patients with Crohn disease receiving perioperative nutritional support were
      included in this retrospective analysis. The patients were divided into three
      groups according to the ways of nutritional support: total enteral nutrition
      group, total parenteral nutrition group and combined nutrition group; there were 
      55 patients in each group. Each group had the same treatment except for
      nutritional support. The efficacy of different approaches of nutritional support 
      was analyzed and compared among the groups. RESULTS: Compared with total enteral 
      and total parenteral nutrition, combined nutrition supplied more sufficient
      energy, the nutritional status improved more significant in short time;
      pre-albumin, transferrin, lymphocytes and platelet count increased significantly.
      The disease remission rate in combined nutrition group was 80.0%, better than
      76.4% in total enteral nutrition group and 74.5% in total parenteral nutrition
      group. The morbidity rate was 10.9% in combined nutrition group, and it was lower
      than that in total enteral nutrition group and total parenteral nutrition group
      (25.4% and 18.2%, respectively). The length of hospital stay was shorter and the 
      treatment was more cost-effective in combined nutrition group. CONCLUSION: For
      patients with Crohn disease, perioperative combined nutritional support is more
      efficient than total enteral or parental nutrition support.

TI  - Fatty acids, IL6, and TNFalpha polymorphisms: an example of nutrigenetics in
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 2241-9
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2009.313 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this work was to study the interaction between genetic
      polymorphisms (single-nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) of pro- and
      anti-inflammatory cytokines and fat intake on the risk of developing Crohn's
      disease (CD) or modifying disease activity. METHODS: Seven SNPs in interleukin 1 
      (IL1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), lymphotoxin alpha (LTalpha), and
      IL6 genes were analyzed in 116 controls and 99 patients with CD. The type of fat 
      intake was evaluated, and the interaction between SNPs and dietary fat in
      modulating disease activity was analyzed. RESULTS: Individuals who were
      homozygous for the IL6-174G/C polymorphism had a six-fold higher risk for CD
      (odds ratio (OR)=6.1; 95% confidence interval (95% CI)=1.9-19.4), whereas the TT 
      genotype on the TNFalpha-857C/T polymorphism was associated with more active
      disease (OR=10.4; 95% CI=1.1-94.1). A high intake of total, saturated, and
      monounsaturated fats, as well as a higher ratio of n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty 
      acid (PUFA), was associated with a more active phenotype (P<0.05). Furthermore,
      there was an interaction between dietary fat intake and SNPs, with a high intake 
      of saturated and monounsaturated fats being associated with active disease,
      mainly in patients carrying the variant alleles of the 857 TNFalpha polymorphism 
      (OR=6.0, 95% CI=1.4-26.2; OR=5.17; 95% CI=1.4-19.2, respectively) and the 174 IL6
      polymorphism (OR=2.95; 95% CI=1.0-9.1; OR=3.21; 95% CI=1.0-10.4, respectively).
      Finally, low intake of n-3 PUFA and high n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio in patients with the 
      TNFalpha 857 polymorphism were associated with higher disease activity (OR=3.6;
      95% CI=1.0-13.0; OR=5.92; 95% CI=1.3-26.5, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These
      results show that different types of fat may interact with cytokine genotype,
      modulating disease activity.

TI  - The use of exclusive enteral nutrition for induction of remission in children
      with Crohn's disease demonstrates that disease phenotype does not influence
      clinical remission.
PG  - 501-7
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2009.04067.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) achieves variable remission rates
      in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). AIM: To describe our experience of
      treating CD with an 8-week course of primary EEN and to study factors affecting
      treatment outcome. METHODS: All CD patients treated with EEN in our centre
      between 2004 and 2007 were included in the study. Remission was determined by a
      combination of clinical parameters. Disease phenotype was assigned using
      published classifications. Inflammatory markers and anthropometry (Z-scores) were
      calculated before and after treatment. RESULTS: A total of 114 children were
      treated (four were excluded). Median age at diagnosis was 11.6 years. Fifty-seven
      (51.8%) were fed orally whilst 53 (48.2%) were fed by tube. Eighty-eight (80%)
      achieved remission with consequent reductions in erythrocyte sedimentation rate
      and C-reactive protein (P < 0.001). Patients in remission had comparative
      improvements in weight (-1.04 cf. -0.40) and BMI Z-scores (-0.98 cf. -0.03) by
      the end of treatment (P < 0.001). Individuals with isolated terminal ileal
      disease (n = 4) had lower remission rates than other locations (P = 0.02). No
      other significant differences in remission rates for any other disease locations 
      were found. CONCLUSIONS: Exclusive enteral nutrition induces clinical remission, 
      normalization of inflammatory markers and improves weight/BMI Z-scores in most
      patients. This study demonstrates that disease phenotype should not influence
      clinicians when commencing patients on EEN.

TI  - Epithelial tight junctions in intestinal inflammation.
PG  - 294-300
LID - 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04062.x [doi]
AB  - The epithelium in inflamed intestinal segments of patients with Crohn's disease
      is characterized by a reduction of tight junction strands, strand breaks, and
      alterations of tight junction protein content and composition. In ulcerative
      colitis, epithelial leaks appear early due to micro-erosions resulting from
      upregulated epithelial apoptosis and in addition to a prominent increase of
      claudin-2. Th1-cytokine effects by interferon-gamma in combination with TNFalpha 
      are important for epithelial damage in Crohn's disease, while interleukin-13
      (IL-13) is the key effector cytokine in ulcerative colitis stimulating apoptosis 
      and upregulation of claudin-2 expression. Focal lesions caused by apoptotic
      epithelial cells contribute to barrier disturbance in IBD by their own
      conductivity and by confluence toward apoptotic foci or erosions. Another type of
      intestinal barrier defect can arise from alpha-hemolysin harboring E. coli
      strains among the physiological flora, which can gain pathologic relevance in
      combination with proinflammatory cytokines under inflammatory conditions. On the 
      other hand, intestinal barrier impairment can also result from transcellular
      antigen translocation via an initial endocytotic uptake into early endosomes, and
      this is intensified by proinflammatory cytokines as interferon-gamma and may thus
      play a relevant role in the onset of IBD. Taken together, barrier defects
      contribute to diarrhea by a leak flux mechanism (e.g., in IBD) and can cause
      mucosal inflammation by luminal antigen uptake. Immune regulation of epithelial
      functions by cytokines may cause barrier dysfunction not only by tight junction
      impairments but also by apoptotic leaks, transcytotic mechanisms, and mucosal
      gross lesions.

TI  - Steroid-sparing properties of sargramostim in patients with
      corticosteroid-dependent Crohn's disease: a randomised, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, phase 2 study.
PG  - 1354-62
LID - 10.1136/gut.2008.165738 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although treatment with corticosteroids induces remission in Crohn's
      disease, prolonged exposure to corticosteroids is undesirable. This randomised
      clinical trial evaluated the efficacy of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage
      colony-stimulating factor (sargramostim), an activator of innate immunity, in
      corticosteroid-dependent patients with Crohn's disease. DESIGN: Patients were
      randomised in a 2:1 ratio, to sargramostim 6 microg/kg subcutaneously once daily 
      or placebo for up to 22 weeks. The study consisted of (1) an adjunctive phase
      (weeks 1-4) in which patients received study drug plus corticosteroid therapy;
      (2) a forced corticosteroid tapering phase (weeks 4-14); and (3) an observation
      phase (4 weeks) in which patients received study drug plus prednisone < or =7.5
      mg. The primary endpoint was corticosteroid-free remission (Crohn's Disease
      Activity Index (CDAI) < or =150) 4 weeks after corticosteroid elimination.
      Secondary endpoints were corticosteroid-free response (CDAI decreased by > or
      =100) and induction of remission in patients who reduced the dose of
      corticosteroid to 2.5-7.5 mg. RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients were randomised to
      sargramostim and 42 to placebo. Significantly more sargramostim-treated patients 
      than placebo patients achieved corticosteroid-free remission (18.6% vs 4.9%; p = 
      0.03). Similar differences were seen for corticosteroid-free response and in
      patients who tapered corticosteroids to 2.5-7.5 mg/day. Sargramostim treatment
      was also associated with significant improvements in health-related quality of
      life. Patients who received sargramostim were more likely to experience
      musculoskeletal pain, injection site reactions and dyspnoea. CONCLUSIONS:
      Sargramostim was more effective than placebo for inducing corticosteroid-free
      remission in patients with Crohn's disease with corticosteroid dependence.
      Sargramostim may provide significant benefit in this population if these findings
      are confirmed.

TI  - Autophagy as an emerging dimension to adaptive and innate immunity.
PG  - 233-41
LID - 10.1016/j.smim.2009.05.004 [doi]
AB  - Autophagy is an evolutionary conserved cellular process during which cytoplasmic 
      material is engulfed in double membrane vacuoles that then fuse with lysosomes,
      ultimately degrading their cargo. Emerging evidence, however, now suggests that
      autophagy can form part of our innate and adaptive immune defense programs.
      Recent studies have identified pattern recognition molecules as mediators of this
      process and shown that intracellular pathogens can interact with and even
      manipulate autophagy. Recent translational evidence has also implicated autophagy
      in the pathogenesis of several immune-mediated diseases, including Crohn disease.
      In this review, we present autophagy in the context of its role as an immune
      system component and effector and speculate on imminent and future research
      directions in this field.

AB  - Single- and double-balloon enteroscopes have similar efficacy. The entire small
      bowel can be examined through the oral route in 60-90minutes in 25-40% of
      patients. Using the oral and rectal routes, complete examinations can be
      performed in 75% of patients The diagnostic indications are mid-gastrointestinal 
      bleeding tumors, Crohn's disease, intestinal obstruction and atypical
      malabsorption. Therapeutic indications include access to enterostomy, hemostasis,
      foreign body withdrawal, dilatation and polypectomy in the small bowel. This
      procedure is also useful to place enteral feeding tubes in patients with an
      excluded stomach. Hemostatic efficacy is high in patients with elevated
      transfusional requirements. For polypectomy, this technique has not been
      demonstrated to have the same efficacy/risk as colonoscopy. Complications include
      pancreatitis (0.34%) and perforation (0.34-6.4%). The level of evidence for
      almost all indications is low, since few prospective and homogeneous studies have
      been performed.

TI  - Exclusive enteral nutrition for children with Crohn's disease: use in Australia
      and attitudes of Australian paediatric gastroenterologists.
PG  - 337-41
LID - 10.1111/j.1440-1754.2009.01498.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: Although available data support a role for exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN)
      in children with Crohn's disease (CD), use of this therapy varies. The aim of
      this study was to define the patterns of use of EEN across Australia and to
      better understand the reasons for this variation. METHODS: Using an existing
      email network, Australian paediatric gastroenterologists were asked to provide
      details of their attitudes towards, and use of, EEN in children. A questionnaire 
      was designed to direct responses, with regard to use of EEN, to current EEN
      protocols and patterns of use. RESULTS: Twenty-one replies were received (58%
      response). Although 12 respondents felt that EEN was an appropriate therapy for
      CD, only 8 regularly used EEN for their patients. Usage varied between states and
      within units. Current use was related to practitioners' experiences of EEN during
      their gastroenterology training. The concerns of those who did not recommend EEN 
      included compliance, cost and resource demands. The doctors who recommend EEN
      reported that family support, team approach and disease location were important
      factors for a positive outcome from EEN. Current protocols varied in terms of
      type of formula, length of therapy and use of concurrent medications.
      CONCLUSIONS: Variations in care were illustrated across these paediatric
      gastroenterologists. Practitioners have many reasons and concerns about the use
      of EEN: these impede the wider use of EEN for paediatric CD. More consistent
      protocols for the use of EEN and an improved understanding of the mechanisms of
      EEN could lead to enhanced use of this therapy.

AB  - Crohn's disease is a chronic, relapsing-remitting inflammatory disease of the
      intestinal tract that commonly requires surgical treatment. Unfortunately, the
      majority of patients will ultimately develop postoperative disease recurrence and
      require subsequent surgery. A number of medications have been researched for the 
      maintenance of postoperative remission. Of these, few have demonstrated
      consistent efficacy. A recently published randomized, controlled trial indicated 
      that infliximab is effective in the maintenance of postoperative remission.

AB  - The most common extraintestinal manifestations of Crohn's disease concern joints,
      skin, and eyes; however other organs such as liver, pancreas, kidneys, heart,
      lungs or brain can also be affected. Aseptic abscesses are an emergent entity in 
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease and despite medical treatment the
      surgical approach may represent an alternative therapy. We report a case of a
      young woman with splenic aseptic abscesses as complication of Crohn's disease.
      After steroid sparing and antibiotic failure the patient underwent successful
      splenectomy.

TI  - PepT1 oligopeptide transporter (SLC15A1) gene polymorphism in inflammatory bowel 
      disease.
PG  - 1562-9
LID - 10.1002/ibd.20963 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human polymorphisms affecting gut epithelial barrier and interactions
      with bacteria predispose to the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) Crohn's disease
      (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The intestinal transporter PepT1, encoded by
      the SLC15A1 gene, mediates intracellular uptake of bacterial products that can
      induce inflammation and NF-kappaB activation upon binding to NOD2, a protein
      often mutated in CD. Hence, we tested SLC15A1 polymorphisms for association with 
      IBD. METHODS: Twelve SLC15A1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were
      genotyped in 1783 individuals from 2 cohorts of Swedish and Finnish IBD patients 
      and controls. An in vitro system was set up to evaluate the potential impact of
      SLC15A1 polymorphism on PepT1 transporter function by quantification of
      NOD2-mediated activation of NF-kappaB. RESULTS: The common allele (C) of a coding
      polymorphism (rs2297322, Ser117Asn) was associated with CD susceptibility both in
      Sweden and in Finland, but with genetic effects in opposite directions (risk and 
      protection, respectively). The best evidence of association was found in both
      populations when the analysis was performed on individuals not carrying NOD2
      common risk alleles (Sweden allelic P = 0.0007, OR 1.97, 95% confidence interval 
      [CI] 1.34-2.92; Finland genotype P = 0.0013, OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.44-0.90). The
      PepT1 variant encoded by the C allele (PepT1-Ser117) was associated with reduced 
      signaling downstream of NOD2 (P < 0.0001 compared to Pept1-Asn117). CONCLUSIONS: 
      A functional polymorphism in the SLC15A1 gene might be of relevance to
      inflammation and antibacterial responses in IBD. Whether this polymorphism truly 
      contributes to disease susceptibility needs to be further addressed, and should
      stimulate additional studies in other populations.

AB  - From epidemiological data, based on concordance data in family studies, via
      linkage analysis to genome-wide association studies, we and others have
      accumulated robust evidence implicating more than 30 distinct genomic loci
      involved in the genetic susceptibility to Crohn's disease (CD). These loci encode
      genes involved in a number of homeostatic mechanisms: innate pattern recognition 
      receptors (NOD2/CARD15, TLR4, CARD9), the differentiation of Th17-lymphocytes
      (IL-23R, JAK2, STAT3, CCR6, ICOSLG), autophagy (ATG16L1, IRGM, LRRK2),
      maintenance of epithelial barrier integrity (IBD5, DLG5, PTGER4, ITLN1, DMBT1,
      XBP1), and the orchestration of the secondary immune response (HLA-region,
      TNFSF15/TL1A, IRF5, PTPN2, PTPN22, NKX2-3, IL-12B, IL-18RAP, MST1). While many of
      these loci also predispose to pediatric CD, an additional number of
      childhood-onset loci have been identified recently (e.g., TNFRSF6B). Not only has
      the identification of these loci improved our understanding of the
      pathophysiology of CD, this knowledge also holds real promise for clinical
      practice.

PG  - 1670-7
LID - 10.1002/ibd.20950 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: No studies have been performed in which therapeutic regimens have
      been compared between mild and moderate-to-severe pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) 
      at diagnosis. The aim was to analyze pediatric CD activity at diagnosis, its
      influence on pediatrician's prescribing behavior, and clinical outcome 5 years
      later. METHODS: In a retrospective multicenter study we divided pediatric CD
      patients at diagnosis into mild or moderate-severe disease. We compared initial
      therapies, duration of first remission, number of exacerbations, height-for-age
      and weight-for-height evolvement, and cumulative duration of systemic steroid use
      in a 5-year follow-up period. RESULTS: Forty-three children were included (25
      with mild and 18 with moderate-severe disease). Aminosalicylate monotherapy was
      more frequently prescribed in the mild group (40% versus 17%; P < 0.01). The
      median duration of systemic steroid use was 18.3 months in the mild group and
      10.4 months in the moderate-severe group (P = 0.09). Duration of first remission 
      was 15.0 months in the mild group and 23.4 months in the moderate-severe group (P
      = 0.16). The mean number of exacerbations was 2.2 in the mild group and 1.8 in
      the moderate-severe group (P = 0.28). CONCLUSIONS: CD patients with mild disease 
      were treated with aminosalicylate monotherapy more frequently. These patients,
      however, tend to have more exacerbations, shorter duration of first remission,
      and longer total duration of systemic steroid use. Our data support the concept
      that severity of disease at diagnosis does not reliably predict subsequent
      clinical course. This study suggests that there is no indication that children
      with mild CD should be treated differently compared to children with
      moderate-severe disease.

      Ashkenazi Jewish patients.
PG  - 531-7
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e318183138a [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyze the IBD5 locus in a homogenous cohort of Ashkenazi Jewish 
      (AJ) children with Crohn disease (CD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 83 AJ
      children with CD and 73 AJ healthy controls were studied. Genotyping for single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) including OCTN1 (SLC22A4; 1672C-->T), OCTN2
      (SLC22A5; 207G-->C), IGR2096, IGR2198, and IGR2230 genes was performed using the 
      TaqMan system. NOD2/CARD15 variants also were typed using established methods.
      RESULTS: All IBD5 SNPs tested were in linkage disequilibrium (D'>0.8), and showed
      significant association with CD in our cohort of AJ children. The IGR2096 SNP,
      which is not located within the same linkage disequilibrium block as the OCTN1
      and 2 SNPs, showed an even stronger association with CD (P = 0.017; odds ratio = 
      1.7). Patients with CD who had the OCTN1 susceptibility allele were more likely
      to carry 1 of the 3 NOD2/CARD15 SNPs tested (P = 0.01; odds ratio = 4.8).
      CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated a significant association between the IBD5
      locus and CD in a homogenous cohort of pediatric AJ patients. Due to the tight
      linkage disequilibrium in the region, it is not possible to identify the
      causative IBD5 variant. Future functional studies will ultimately reveal the
      causative gene variant at this locus.

TI  - Methotrexate treatment in pediatric Crohn disease patients intolerant or
      resistant to purine analogues.
PG  - 526-30
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e318196df3e [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Immunomodulatory drugs play a major role in maintaining remission and
      steroid sparing in children with Crohn disease. Although thiopurine agents are
      commonly used, unresponsiveness or intolerance to these drugs is common. The
      efficacy of methotrexate in maintenance of remission has been shown in adult
      Crohn disease; however, pediatric data are limited. Our goal was to evaluate the 
      efficacy and safety of methotrexate in induction and maintenance of clinical
      remission in children with active Crohn disease who failed thiopurine treatment. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a retrospective multicenter study, efficacy of
      methotrexate in inducing and maintaining remission or response was assessed by
      Harvey-Bradshaw activity index, paediatric Crohn disease activity index and
      steroid use, in 25 children with Crohn disease, refractory or intolerant to
      thiopurine analogues. RESULTS: Crohn disease was diagnosed at a mean age of 11.1 
      +/- 3.1 years and methotrexate was initiated at age 14.5 +/- 3.1 years. The
      median methotrexate dose was 12.5 mg/m2. Remission was achieved in 16 patients
      (64%), and response in 6 patients (24%). Out of 18 patients treated for longer
      than 6 months, 83% were in remission or response after 12 months of treatment.
      The mean duration of remission and response was 10.8 +/- 8.8 months. Steroid
      withdrawal was possible in 12/16 patients (75%) receiving steroids at
      methotrexate introduction. Adverse effects were observed in 6 patients (24%)
      including nausea and vomiting in 3, elevation of liver enzymes in 2 and
      pancreatitis in 1 patient. CONCLUSIONS: Methotrexate is beneficial in maintaining
      remission and steroid-sparing treatment in children with Crohn disease following 
      failure of thiopurine therapy.

TI  - Dietary intakes of children with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1052-7
LID - 10.1017/S0007114509359085 [doi]
AB  - Approximately 25 % of individuals with Crohn's disease (CD), a life-long
      relapsing-remitting disease, are diagnosed during childhood and adolescence.
      Symptoms of CD, including abdominal pain, nausea and diarrhoea, can lead to
      reduced food intake, which may negatively have an impact on nutritional status
      during this critical period of growth and development. The aims of the present
      study were to assess the growth and adequacy of dietary intakes of children with 
      CD at Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick, and compare with healthy controls.
      Sixty-three subjects aged 10-16 years were recruited, including: children with
      active CD (n 18), children with CD in remission (n 23) and healthy controls (n
      22). Dietary intake was assessed using a FFQ and compared with current Australian
      recommended dietary intakes (RDI). Growth and dietary intakes were compared
      between groups. Subjects with active CD had lower weight and BMI Z scores than
      children in remission and controls. The energy intakes of children with active CD
      and those in remission were significantly lower than estimated energy
      requirements (P = 0.001 and P = 0.03 respectively). Children with active CD did
      not meet the RDI for Fe and their Ca intake was lower than the RDI (P = 0.04). In
      conclusion, the dietary intake of children with active CD was impaired, with
      inadequate intakes of energy, Ca and Fe. Reduced energy intakes during active
      disease may contribute to poor weight gain and impaired growth. Quantifying
      nutrient intake and ascertaining requirements for nutritional supplementation are
      essential components of successful management in paediatric CD.

TI  - Polymorphisms in E-cadherin (CDH1) result in a mis-localised cytoplasmic protein 
      that is associated with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1121-7
LID - 10.1136/gut.2008.175117 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with Crohn's disease have defects in intestinal epithelial
      permeability that are inadequately explained by known inflammatory bowel disease 
      (IBD) susceptibility genes. E-cadherin (CDH1) plays a vital role in maintaining
      the integrity of the intestinal barrier and its cellular localisation is
      disrupted in patients with Crohn's disease. AIM: To determine if polymorphisms in
      the CDH1 gene are associated with Crohn's disease and to determine the function
      associated with these polymorphisms. METHODS: The hypothesis was tested using a
      candidate gene approach using 20 Tag SNPs derived from the HapMap and Crohn's
      disease trios. Functional studies were carried out using HapMap cell lines and
      polarised epithelial cell lines (MDCK-1 and Caco2). RESULTS: Here we show that
      CDH1 is associated with Crohn's disease in 327 trios (rs10431923 excess
      transmission of "TT" genotype; p = 0.0020) and is replicated in the Wellcome
      Trust Case Control Consortium CD data set (TT risk allele; OR 1.2, p = 0.005).
      Patients with the Crohn's disease risk haplotype (rs12597188, rs10431923 and
      rs9935563; GTC allelic frequency 21%; p = 0.000016) exhibited increased
      E-cadherin cytoplasmic accumulation in their intestinal epithelium which may be
      explained by the presence of a novel truncated form of E-cadherin. Accordingly,
      expression of this truncated E-cadherin in cultured polarised epithelial cells
      resulted in abnormal intracellular accumulation and impaired plasma membrane
      localisation of both E-cadherin and beta-catenin. CONCLUSION: The
      mis-localisation of E-cadherin and beta-catenin may explain the increased
      permeability seen in some patients with Crohn's disease. Thus, the polymorphisms 
      identified in CDH1 are important for understanding the pathogenesis of Crohn's
      disease and point to a defect in barrier defence.

AB  - Aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is complex and probably
      multifactorial. Nutrition has been proposed to be an important aetiological
      factor for development of IBD. Several components of the diet (such as sugar,
      fat, fibre, fruit and vegetable, protein, fast food, preservatives etc.) were
      examined as possible causative agents for IBD. According to some researchers
      infant feeding (breast feeding) may also contribute to the development of IBD.
      Though the importance of environmental factors is evidenced by the increasing
      incidence in developed countries and in migrant population in recent decades, the
      aetiology of IBD remained unclear. There are many theories, but as yet no dietary
      approaches have been proved to reduce the risk of developing IBD. The role of
      nutrition in the management of IBD is better understood. The prevention and
      correction of malnutrition, the provision of macro- and micronutrients and
      vitamins and the promotion of optimal growth and development of children are key 
      points of nutritional therapy. In active disease, the effective support of energy
      and nutrients is a very important part of the therapy. Natural and artificial
      nutrition or the combination of two can be chosen for supporting therapy of IBD. 
      The author summarises the aetiological and therapeutic role of nutrition in IBD.

TI  - Capsule endoscopy in the evaluation of patients with unexplained growth failure.
PG  - 647-50
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e31818b0ac7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poor weight gain and growth can be caused by many medical,
      nutritional, behavioral, and psychological factors. Crohn disease is one of the
      more common gastrointestinal etiologies associated with growth failure. The aim
      of this study is to determine the role of capsule endoscopy (CE) in the
      evaluation of older children and adolescents who were referred to a pediatric
      gastroenterology service for a chief complaint of unexplained growth failure.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of children with
      growth failure undergoing CE between August 2002 and November 2005. Height and
      weight (expressed as z scores) were recorded at least 6 months before study, at
      the time of the study, and at least 6 months post study. All of the patients had 
      celiac disease and Crohn disease excluded using standard biochemical, radiologic,
      endoscopic, and histologic assessment. RESULTS: Seven children (4 males and 3
      females) were included in the study-mean age 11.7+/-3.6 years. Indications for CE
      were growth failure associated with abdominal pain (3 patients), diarrhea and
      apthous ulcers (2 patients), delayed puberty (1 patient), or a family history of 
      Crohn disease (1 patient). The mean z score for weight at the time of the study
      was 2.10+/-1.0 and for height was 1.50+/-0.7 All 7 children had normal small
      bowel series performed before the CE. All had both endoscopically and
      histologically normal esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy. In 4 of 7
      patients, multiple small bowel apthous ulcerations consistent with Crohn disease 
      were identified by CE. All 4 patients who had abnormal CE were treated and
      started gaining weight. The mean z score for weight after 6 months of treatment
      was 1.35+/-1.2 and for height was 0.50+/-1.7. The mean z score for weight after
      treatment was significantly improved compared with the mean z score at diagnosis 
      (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In our study, 4 of the 7 older children and adolescents
      with unexplained growth failure and normal small bowel series were found to have 
      Crohn disease involving the small intestine. In addition, we were able to show
      the improvement on the mean z score for weight after treatment of small bowel
      Crohn disease was instituted.

TI  - Bone health in children with inflammatory bowel disease: adjusting for bone age.
PG  - 538-43
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0b013e31818cb4b6 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Clinical results of bone mineral density for children with
      inflammatory bowel disease are commonly reported using reference data for
      chronological age. It is known that these children, particularly those with Crohn
      disease, experience delayed growth and maturation. Therefore, it is more
      appropriate to compare clinical results with bone age rather than chronological
      age. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Areal bone mineral density (aBMD) was measured using 
      dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, and bone age was assessed using the
      Tanner-Whitehouse 3 method from a standard hand/wrist radiograph. Results were
      available for 44 children ages 7.99 to 16.89 years. Areal bone mineral density
      measurements were converted to z scores using both chronological and bone ages
      for each subject. RESULTS: Areal bone mineral density z scores calculated using
      bone age, as opposed to chronological age, were significantly improved for both
      the total body and lumbar spine regions of interest. When subjects were grouped
      according to diagnosis, bone age generated z scores remained significantly
      improved for those with Crohn disease but not for those diagnosed with ulcerative
      colitis. Grouping of children with Crohn disease into younger and older ages
      produced significantly higher z scores using bone age compared with chronological
      for the older age group, but not the younger age group. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      findings, in accordance with those presented in the literature, suggest that aBMD
      results in children with Crohn disease should include the consideration of bone
      age, rather than merely chronological age. Bone size, although not as easily
      available, would also be an important consideration for interpreting results in
      paediatric populations.

TI  - Cutaneous presentation of kwashiorkor due to infantile Crohn's disease.
PG  - 117-9
LID - 10.1007/s00431-009-0981-5 [doi]
AB  - Kwashiorkor is one of the severe forms of protein-energy malnutrition. Many
      characteristic dermatoses can be seen in children suffering from kwashiorkor, and
      some are pathognomonic. Here, we report an infant who presented with diarrhea and
      skin signs of kwashiorkor, and duodenal biopsy was consistent with Crohn's
      disease. The patient was treated with prednisolone administered orally in a
      tapering course plus azathioprine, in addition to nutritional supplementation.
      The general condition of the patient quickly improved and his skin lesions
      completely resolved within 2 weeks. Kwashiorkor is a serious potentially fatal
      disease that occurs less often in developed countries leading to low index of
      suspicion by physicians and pediatricians in those regions. Occasionally,
      dermatologists have the rare chance of alerting pediatricians to the diagnosis of
      kwashiorkor, thus making a difference in the care of this disease.

      peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1379-84
LID - 10.1002/ibd.20935 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The leukocyte function associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) intracellular
      adhesion molecule-1 pathway is presumed to play a pivotal role in the
      perpetuation of inflammatory bowel disease. We aimed to elucidate the effect of 2
      different therapies on LFA-1 expression in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and
      correlate LFA-1 expression with disease activity. METHODS: In all, 30 patients
      with active CD were recruited for the present investigation. Eleven patients were
      treated with infliximab and 19 patients with total parenteral nutrition. The
      clinical activity and the expression of LFA-1 in peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells were assessed prior to and 4 weeks after treatment. Clinical activity was
      determined by measuring the Crohn's Disease Activity Index and LFA-1 expression
      was measured by mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) under fluorescence-activated
      cell sorter analysis. RESULTS: In each treatment group the clinical disease
      activity index decreased significantly 4 weeks after treatment. In patients
      treated with infliximab, LFA-1 expression decreased significantly (mean MFI
      decreased from 1983 to 1487, P < 0.05). However, LFA-1 expression remained
      unchanged in the total parenteral nutrition group (mean MFI elevated from 1684 to
      1902, P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The mechanism of therapeutic action on CD is
      different between infliximab and total parenteral nutrition.

AB  - Information on safety and efficacy of adalimumab in children with Crohn's disease
      (CD) is limited. We present a case-series of 14 children with severe CD treated
      with adalimumab during a 3.5-year period. Fourteen children (nine boys, five
      girls), aged 13.9 years (range 1.9-19.1) were treated with adalimumab during 12.5
      months (range 7-42). All had steroid or immunosuppression-drugs refractory
      disease. Ten patients (71%) had been previously treated with infliximab, 13/14
      were treated with different immunosuppressive drugs and all were
      steroid-dependent or resistant. Seven children (50%) showed full clinical
      response and 5/14 (35%) improved partially. Two children (15%) had loss of
      response after a period of transient improvement. Adalimumab treatment enabled
      complete steroids withdrawal in 8/14 (57%) of steroid-dependent children.
      Currently, five children are in complete remission with adalimumab monotherapy
      for a median 14 months (range 9-24). Adalimumab may induce and maintain remission
      in children with severe, refractory CD. Prospective safety and efficacy
      confirmation of this data in children is necessary.

LID - 10.1007/s00774-009-0059-5 [doi]
AB  - Compromised skeletal status is a frequent finding in patients with Crohn's
      disease (CD), leading to increased fracture risk. Low body weight is associated
      with bone mineral density (BMD) in CD, although the relative importance of its
      components, lean and fat mass, is unclear. Muscle strength is also a predictor of
      BMD in nondiseased populations; however, its association with bone in CD is
      unknown. We examined the independent effects of body composition and muscle
      strength on regional and whole-body BMD in a cohort of CD patients. Sixty men and
      women, aged 22-72 years, with disease duration of 13 +/- 7 years, underwent
      scanning of the spine, hip, forearm, and whole-body BMD by dual-energy X-ray
      absorptiometry (DXA). Lean tissue, appendicular muscle mass (AMM), and fat mass
      were derived by DXA and grip strength by dynamometry. Medical history, medication
      usage, clinical variables, and nutritional intake were obtained by questionnaire.
      Prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis was 32 and 17%, respectively, with
      osteopenia more common at the hip and osteoporosis more common at the spine. In
      multiple regression analyses, AMM was an independent predictor of whole-body and 
      regional BMD whereas lean mass was an independent predictor at the hip. Neither
      grip strength nor fat mass was independently associated with BMD. Of the
      components of body composition, muscle mass was strongly associated with regional
      and whole-body BMD. Preserving or augmenting muscle mass in this population may
      be a useful strategy to preserve BMD and thereby reduce fracture risk.

AB  - Nutrition plays a role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) primarily in
      prevention and treatment of malnutrition and growth failure. Furthermore, in
      Crohn disease (CD), nutrition can induce remission, maintain remission, and
      prevent relapse. Malnutrition is common in IBD and the mechanisms involved
      include decreased food intake, malabsorption, increased nutrient loss, increased 
      energy requirements, and drug-nutrient interactions. At the time of diagnosis, up
      to 85% of pediatric patients with CD and 65% of those with ulcerative colitis
      (UC) have weight loss. Growth failure occurs in 15% to 40% of children with IBD
      and is less common in UC compared with CD, both at diagnosis and during
      follow-up. In CD, nutritional therapy with enteral formulas induces remission at 
      a rate comparable with that achieved with steroids. In adults with CD, limited
      information suggests that enteral nutrition (EN) may play a role in maintenance
      of remission. In children with CD colitis, one study suggested that children
      without colitis respond better to EN than children with colitis, and another
      study found no such difference but reported a trend toward earlier relapse in
      those with isolated colonic involvement. Finally, nutrition may play a role in
      IBD via the possible protective effect of breastfeeding against UC and CD. In
      summary, although only CD may benefit from nutrition as primary therapy for
      remission induction and possibly maintenance of remission, nutrition plays an
      important role in the prevention and treatment of malnutrition in IBD, and may
      have a protective role, via the effect of breast-feeding on disease occurrence.

AB  - Postoperative Crohn's disease (CD) recurrence is a common occurrence after
      intestinal resection. Currently, the optimal management of patients who have
      undergone surgical resection is unknown and treatment remains subjective.
      Clinicians in conjunction with patients must balance the risks of recurrence
      against the potential risks associated with treatment. For those at very low risk
      of recurrence, no therapy may be needed; however, for patients at moderate risk
      immunomodulators should be considered. For those at highest risk of recurrence,
      biologic therapy, specifically antitumor necrosis factor agents, have emerged as 
      appropriate treatment. Any postoperative management strategy should include a
      colonoscopy 6-12 months after surgery to identify recurrence. This review
      discusses current evidence for various pharmacologic approaches in the prevention
      of postoperative recurrence and provides guidance for clarifying patient risk.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The incidence of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in
      Western countries is on the rise. No prospective studies have been conducted on
      the epidemiology of pediatric IBD in Poland. The aim of the study was to define
      the characteristics of new pediatric IBD and assess the incidence of new IBD
      among children in Poland between 2002 and 2004. METHODS: Patient records from 24 
      pediatric gastroenterology centers servicing the whole population of Poland were 
      collected. IBD diagnosis was based on clinical, radiological, endoscopic and
      histological features. RESULTS: There were 491 new IBD patients, representing an 
      overall incidence of IBD of 2.7 cases/100,000 children/year. The incidence of
      Crohn's disease (CD) was 0.6, ulcerative colitis (UC) 1.3, and indeterminate
      colitis (IC) 0.8. The age-related incidence of IBD was 1.8 in the 0- to
      10-year-old age group, rising to 3.7 for the 11- to 18-year age group.
      CONCLUSIONS: The overall incidence of IBD (as well as CD, UC and IC) in Poland is
      lower than that in Western countries. The relative contribution of UC and IC to
      the overall IBD incidence is higher in Poland than in most Western countries.
      These findings may suggest a tendency towards under- or misdiagnosis.

TI  - Positioning biologic agents in the treatment of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1570-82
LID - 10.1002/ibd.20918 [doi]
AB  - One decade after the emergence of biologic therapy for Crohn's disease (CD), our 
      treatment algorithms are beginning to change. Once reserved for patients with
      refractory disease, disease unresponsive to conventional therapies, or those
      requiring multiple courses of corticosteroids, there is increasing evidence that 
      early, aggressive interventions with immunosuppressants or biologic therapies
      targeting tumor necrosis factor-alpha or alpha-4 integrins can alter the natural 
      history of CD by reducing the transmural complications of structuring and
      fistulization and the nearly inevitable requisite for surgical resections. More
      recent trials are beginning to suggest that intervention with combination therapy
      for selected patients with a poor prognosis may modify the long-term course of
      CD. Selection of patients with features predicting a complex or progressive
      course and early, combined intervention is now possible. Future studies are still
      needed to best identify predictors of response to individual agents with
      differing mechanisms of action, as well as to optimize the risk-benefit of
      long-term maintenance therapy.

TI  - Effects of infliximab therapy on abdominal fat and metabolic profile in patients 
      with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1476-84
LID - 10.1002/ibd.20931 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tumor necrosis factor is an adipocytokine possessing a
      well-established lipolytic effect. In Crohn's disease (CD) patients, infliximab
      therapy may thus result in visceral fat accumulation, which is associated with an
      increased risk of metabolic syndrome. METHODS: A total of 132 CD patients were
      investigated. In a first prospective study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      quantification of subcutaneous and visceral abdominal fat was performed before
      and 8 weeks after initiation of infliximab induction therapy (5 mg/kg at weeks 0,
      2, and 6) in 21 responding patients treated for perianal disease. In a second
      prospective study, fasting glycemia, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), HDL, LDL, and
      total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were assessed in 111 responding
      patients receiving infliximab infusions every 8 weeks, with a mean follow-up of
      41 weeks. RESULTS: A significant homogeneous 18% increase in total abdominal fat 
      was observed in the 21 CD patients after infliximab induction therapy (P =
      0.027), independently of body mass index evolution. Infliximab maintenance
      therapy was associated with a decrease in glycemia (P < 0.0001) and HbA1c (P =
      0.0005) concentrations, together with an increase in both total cholesterol (P = 
      0.02) and HDL cholesterol (P = 0.008) concentrations. All glycemic and lipid
      parameters remained within the normal range throughout the study. CONCLUSIONS:
      Infliximab induction therapy is associated with a significant increase in
      abdominal fat tissue in CD patients. Infliximab maintenance therapy has no
      deleterious effects on lipid profile and is accompanied by a decrease in glycemia
      and HbA1c concentrations, probably by reversing the impairment of tumor necrosis 
      factor-induced insulin-mediated glucose uptake.

LID - 10.1016/j.humimm.2009.03.002 [doi]
AB  - Bacterial sensing is crucial for appropriate response by the innate and adaptive 
      immune system against invading microorganisms. Single nucleotide polymorphisms
      (SNPs) in genes involved in bacterial recognition, CARD15 and TLR4, increased the
      risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in a New Zealand Caucasian case-control 
      cohort. We now consider the effects of SNPs in CD14, TLR9, and BPI, analyzed
      individually, in association with one another, and with SNPs in CARD15 or TLR4 in
      this same population group. SNPs in CD14 (c.-159 C>T), TLR9 (c.-1237T>C) and BPI 
      (c.645A>G) showed no significant allele or genotype frequency differences between
      IBD cases and controls. Genotype-phenotype mapping reveals an association with
      BPI and ileocolonic Crohn's disease (CD) as well as an association with CD14 and 
      early-onset ulcerative colitis (UC). Genotype interaction analyses using three
      different statistical approaches provided significant evidence of interaction for
      the following combinations: CARD15/TLR4 (CD and UC), CARD15/CD14 (CD and UC),
      CD14/TLR4 (UC only), and CD14/BPI (UC only). A trend for an association between
      BPI and TLR4 was observed in UC patients, but failed to reach statistical
      significance. Our findings support the idea of gene-gene interactions for genes
      involved in closely related pathways (i.e. bacterial detection). There is
      evidence that carrying two SNPs in genes may lead to statistical significance for
      genes and SNPs that do not otherwise confirm as risk alleles for disease
      aetiology when analysed alone.

TI  - Factors predictive of Crohn disease following colectomy in medically refractory
      pediatric colitis.
PG  - 283-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Crohn disease (CD) has been diagnosed following colectomy for
      ulcerative colitis (UC). This study aims to determine the frequency of this
      occurrence, and to identify predictive factors leading to a CD diagnosis.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed in patients who
      have undergone colectomy. RESULTS: From 1996 to 2006, colectomy was performed in 
      212 patients, 37 of whom were diagnosed preoperatively with UC. The mean ages at 
      diagnosis and at colectomy were 10.6+/-4.3 years and 13.7+/-3.7 years,
      respectively. Inflammatory bowel disease serology at diagnosis in 29 patients
      showed that 26 (90%) were pANCA+. Serology was negative in 3. Ten (27%) had
      nonspecific inflammation of the upper digestive tract. Radiographs in 25 patients
      indicated no abnormalities in the small intestine. Before colectomy, patients
      (n=35) were treated with corticosteroid (97%), 5-ASA (69%), immunomodulator
      (66%), infliximab (29%), and cyclosporin (11%). The mean postoperative follow-up 
      was 2.6+/-2 years. Six patients (16%) were found to have CD. All 6 patients were 
      pANCA+ with elevated anti-OmpC (n=4), ASCA immunoglobulin A (n=2), and ASCA
      immunoglobulin G (n=1). The CD group had higher mean anti-OmpC compared with the 
      UC group, 16.9+/-5.2 and 6.2+/-3.4, respectively (P<0.005). Weight z score at
      time of surgery was lower in the CD group (-1.38+/-0.79) than in the UC group
      (0.29+/-0.24), P<0.05. CONCLUSIONS: The possibility of CD remains in a small
      fraction of patients who undergo colectomy for medically refractory UC. A lower
      weight and a higher anti-OmpC titer may be predictive of CD.

TI  - Pediatric inflammatory bowel diseases and the risk of lymphoma: should we revise 
      our treatment strategies?
PG  - 257-67
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are lifelong inflammatory gastrointestinal
      diseases starting in about one third of patients during childhood. Treatment
      strategies aim to control this chronic inflammatory process. Owing to recent
      advances in the understanding of IBD, immunosuppressive agents (mainly against
      TNFalpha directed) as well as biological drugs are more and more often used. This
      therapeutic approach clearly improved the clinical condition of the majority of
      patients with IBD. However, with this more aggressive treatment strategy, safety 
      concerns clearly arise. Recently, the description of a series of a particularly
      severe form of T cell lymphoma in pediatric and young adult patients with IBD
      under immunomodulator and biological combination therapy raised the question of
      the risks of treatment-induced side effects or complications. As reviewed in the 
      present article, there is a slightly increased risk of not only lymphoma
      development in IBD patients, potentially related to the inflammatory process, but
      also to the use of immunosuppressive therapies. On the basis of the literature
      data, were analyzed current treatment strategies for children with
      moderate-to-severe IBD, who are candidates to receive immunomodulator and/or
      biological agents potentially accelerating the risk of lymphoma development.
      Comparative clinical studies in IBD are still missing; however, it is prudent to 
      think about adapting immunosuppressive therapies to the inflammatory process of
      the underlying disorder and if possible to reduce them to monotherapy.
      Alternative treatment strategies for heavy immunosuppression exist (eg, enteral
      nutrition in Crohn disease or colectomy in patients with ulcerative colitis) and 
      should be considered whenever appropriate. There is a major need for comparative 
      studies before evidence-based guidelines can be established for safest and best
      treatment strategies of pediatric patients with IBD.

TI  - Alterations of taste perception in Crohn's disease and their dependency on
      disease activity and nutritional behavior.
PG  - 617-21
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0b013e31818acf91 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) is unknown. Besides
      immunoregulatory, genetic and environmental aspects, a nutritional impact is also
      encountered. Whether taste perception exerts any influence on an increased
      consumption of carbohydrates is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate nutritional
      habits and taste perception in CD patients, either in active or inactive disease 
      stages. DESIGN: A prospective study was performed with 31 active and 27 inactive 
      CD patients, and 30 age and sex-matched healthy subjects. Nutritional behavior
      was determined using an extensive optical nutrition questionnaire and taste
      perception was assessed by a 3-drop method with exceeding dilution tests.
      RESULTS: Active and inactive CD patients exhibited a significant increased taste 
      threshold for the detection of all solutions (bitter: P=0.0012; salty: P=0.0198; 
      sour: P=0.0021; and sweet: P=0.0208). For recognition, the determination of
      bitter solution (P=0.0014) was significantly reduced in CD patients compared with
      healthy subjects. No impact of clinical or objective parameters of inflammation
      on taste perception could be established. The consumption of refined sugar in CD 
      patients was higher than in healthy subjects, though not significant.
      CONCLUSIONS: An increased taste threshold for the detection of all 4 taste
      qualities in active and inactive CD patients suggests a systemic pathogenesis,
      such as an inflammation of the oral cavity, as a manifestation of CD. In this
      study, changes in taste threshold were not associated with altered sugar
      consumption.

AB  - Probiotics are live microorganisms that produce a benefit to the host when
      provided in adequate amounts from food or supplements. There is an increased
      interest in the use of probiotics in the management and treatment of complex
      medical conditions. Recommendations for probiotic supplementation in the
      pediatric population are often conflicting due to limited research in many
      pediatric disease states. Research on single and multistrain probiotics has shown
      promise for some pediatric populations. This review discusses the research
      available for probiotic supplementation for children with irritable bowel
      syndrome, Crohn's disease, diarrhea, short bowel syndrome, human immunodeficiency
      virus, and food allergies. Probiotic safety also is discussed.

TI  - Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor autoantibodies in murine ileitis

PG  - 1261-71, e1-3
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2008.12.046 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Genetic variations that affect innate immunity increase risk
      of ileal Crohn's disease (CD). However, the penetrance of susceptibility genes,
      including NOD2, is low, suggesting additional risk factors. Neutralizing
      autoantibodies (Ab) against granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
      (GM-CSF Ab) reduce neutrophil antimicrobial function in patients with primary
      alveolar proteinosis (PAP). We investigated whether GM-CSF Ab regulates
      neutrophil function in CD. METHODS: Serum samples from 354 adult and pediatric
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) were analyzed for GM-CSF Ab and
      IBD markers. Levels of GM-CSF Ab were compared with patients' CD features and
      neutrophil function. Intestinal barrier function and nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced injury were assessed in GM-CSF-null and
      NOD2-null mice. RESULTS: Median GM-CSF Ab levels increased from 0.4 microg/mL in 
      control serum to 2.4 microg/mL in pediatric CD and 11.7 microg/mL in adult CD
      serum and were associated with ileal involvement (P<.001). Ileal location,
      duration of disease, and increased GM-CSF Ab levels were associated with
      stricturing/penetrating behavior (odds ratio, 2.2; P=.018). The positive and
      negative predictive values of GM-CSF Ab for stricturing/penetrating behavior were
      comparable with that of other IBD serum markers. CD patients with increased
      GM-CSF Ab had reduced neutrophil phagocytic capacity and increased accumulation
      of pSTAT3+ neutrophils in the affected ileum. GM-CSF-null mice and NOD2-null mice
      in which GM-CSF was neutralized had defects in mucosal barrier function and
      developed a transmural ileitis following NSAID exposure. CONCLUSIONS: GM-CSF
      regulates ileal homeostasis in CD and in mouse models. CD patients with increases
      in serum GM-CSF Ab might benefit from GM-CSF administration.

TI  - CD68 expression is markedly different in Crohn's disease and the colitis
      associated with chronic granulomatous disease.
PG  - 1213-7
LID - 10.1002/ibd.20890 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare inherited
      immunodeficiency disorder characterized by inability of phagocytes to kill
      certain bacteria and fungi. Histology from colon biopsies of CGD patients have
      shown the presence of inflammation and granulomas, almost indistinguishable from 
      the findings seen in Crohn's disease. We sought to determine if there were any
      differences in the cell types that comprise the inflammatory infiltrates in
      inflamed colon specimens between the 2 diseases. The objective was to determine
      whether the pattern of inflammatory cell composition could be used to distinguish
      CGD-associated colitis from Crohn's colitis. METHODS: Biopsies from 6 patients
      with Crohn's disease, 6 patients with CGD, and 6 control patients were stained
      with antibodies to CD3, CD4, CD8, CD68, CD79, CD163, and Foxp3. Positively
      staining cells per mm(2) of lamina propria were calculated for each antibody,
      with the exception of CD163, in which a percent area of lamina propria stained
      was calculated. RESULTS: There was a marked difference in the average CD68+ cells
      per mm(2) of lamina propria between the 2 groups (Crohn's: 1104.2 cells/mm(2);
      CGD: 242.3 cells/mm(2), P < 0.0004) and a significant difference between the CGD 
      group and control group (Control: 565.4 cells/mm(2), CGD: 242.3 cells/mm(2), P = 
      0.0072). There were no significant differences between Crohn's and CGD biopsies
      in the other cell types. CONCLUSIONS: This phenomenon provides physicians with a 
      simple and valuable tool to identify CGD in patients with colonic inflammation.

TI  - Comparison between handgrip strength, subjective global assessment,
      anthropometry, and biochemical markers in assessing nutritional status of
      patients with Crohn's disease in clinical remission.
PG  - 137-44

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Crohn's disease (CD) may lead to protein and calorie malnutrition
      (PCM) secondary to impaired digestive and absorptive functions of the small
      intestine and sometimes to the influence of diet taboos. The earlier the PCM is
      diagnosed, the higher are the odds of reversal. The objective of this study was
      to compare different methods of nutritional assessment in patients with CD and
      correlate them with the disease characteristics. SAMPLE: The sample comprised 75 
      patients with CD from the Gastroenterology Service at the Hospital de Clinicas de
      Porto Alegre; 37 were male, with a mean age of 38.2 years old (SD = 13.3). All
      patients had been in clinical remission (CDAI <150) for over 3 months. They were 
      not receiving enteral or parenteral nutrition. The nutritional assessment was
      considered: body mass index (BMI), triceps skin fold (TSF), arm circumference
      (MAC), arm muscle circumference (MAMC), subjective global assessment (SGA),
      non-dominating handgrip strength (HGS) and food intake inquiries. RESULTS: When
      comparing the different nutritional assessment methods, 26.7% of the patients
      were malnourished according to the MAC, 29.3% according to the MAMC, 18.7%
      according to the SGA, 6.7% according to the BMI, 37.3% according to the TSF and
      73.3% according to the HGS. No statistically significant associations were found 
      for disease location, its behavior, drugs utilized, ESR, CRP, age of patients and
      disease time with the nutritional state verified by HGS, TSF, MAMC and SGA.
      CONCLUSION: The prevalence of malnutrition is significant in patients with CD,
      even in clinical remission. The BMI should not be used as reference in this
      population. The HGS detected a high prevalence of nutritional risk in patients
      with CD in remission. Studies are required that correlate it with more sensitive 
      methods, for the patients' effective nutritional state assessment.

AB  - The exact aetiology of Crohn's disease remains unknown. The consensus is that the
      disease results from a complex interaction between genes, immunity and
      environmental factors. Diet is attractive, in theory, as an environmental risk
      factor in the aetiology of the disease. The epidemiological data, often impeded
      by methodological issues, have failed to confirm a direct link between pre-diet
      illness and the development of Crohn's disease. Once diagnosed, however,
      nutrition has an important role in disease management. Among the nutritional
      issues are malnutrition, weight loss and suboptimal nutritional status; these
      outcomes may be present at any stage of the disease but are likely to be overt
      during acute illness and hospitalisation. Malnutrition has been identified in
      approximately 40% of hospital admissions with Crohn's disease and is associated
      with higher mortality, longer hospital stays and higher healthcare costs.
      Patients in remission may indeed be overweight and appear to be influenced by the
      general population trends toward overweight and obesity. Irrespective of BMI,
      patients are at risk of micronutrient deficiencies. Vitamin D deficiency, for
      example, is common in Crohn's disease and has important implications for bone
      health. Moreover, newer evidence suggests that vitamin D has potential
      anti-inflammatory effects. Dietary approaches, in the form of enteral nutrition, 
      have previously been shown to reduce inflammation and treat the active disease.
      Current guidelines now recommend that corticosteroids are more effective than
      enteral nutrition for treating adults. Enteral nutrition has important growth and
      developmental benefits and continues to be a recommended therapy for children
      with Crohn's disease.

TI  - Growth abnormalities persist in newly diagnosed children with crohn disease
      despite current treatment paradigms.
PG  - 168-74

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We analyzed growth outcomes in children newly diagnosed with Crohn
      disease and determined whether growth abnormalities persist despite current
      therapies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical and growth data were prospectively
      obtained on an inception cohort younger than 16 years old at diagnosis and Tanner
      I to III during the study. RESULTS: In all, 176 children (mean age 10.1 years;
      65% male) with mild (33%) or moderate/severe (67%) disease at diagnosis were
      studied. Disease activity at 1 year was inactive/mild (89%) or moderate/severe
      (11%). First-year treatments included immunomodulators (60%), corticosteroids
      (77%), 5-aminosalicylates (61%), infliximab (15%), and enteral nutrition (10%).
      By 2 years, 86% had received immunomodulators and 36% infliximab. Mean height z
      scores at diagnosis, 1 year, and 2 years were -0.49 +/- 1.2 standard deviations
      (SDs), -0.50 +/- 1.2, and -0.46 +/- 1.1, respectively. Of the subjects, 10%, 8%, 
      and 6.5% had height z scores less than -2 SD at diagnosis, 1 year, and 2 years. A
      height velocity z score less than -1SD was seen in 45% of subjects at 1 year and 
      38% at 2 years. The mean height velocity z score, however, increased between 1
      and 2 years from -0.71 to 0.26 (P < 0.03). Corticosteroid use greater than 6
      months in the first year was associated with abnormal height velocity at 1 year
      (adjusted odds ratio = 4.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.2-9.6). No
      statistically significant effect on height velocity z scores was noted when
      comparing those receiving or not receiving infliximab. CONCLUSIONS: Growth delay 
      persists in many children with CD following diagnosis, despite improved disease
      activity and the frequent use of immunomodulators and biologics. Additional
      strategies to improve growth outcomes require development.

TI  - Budesonide for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease.
PG  - CD002913
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD002913.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Corticosteroids have been shown to be effective for induction, but
      not maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. However, significant concerns
      exist regarding their risk for adverse events, particularly when used for long
      treatment courses. Budesonide is a glucocorticoid with limited systemic
      bioavailability due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Budesonide has
      been shown to be effective for induction of remission in Crohn's disease.
      OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral budesonide for
      maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. SEARCH STRATEGY: The following
      electronic databases were searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central
      Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane IBD/FBD Group Specialised Trial
      Register, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Reference lists of articles, as well as
      conference proceedings were manually searched. Study authors, study sponsors and 
      pharmaceutical companies were also contacted. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized
      controlled trials comparing budesonide to a control treatment, or comparing two
      doses of budesonide, were included. The study population included patients of any
      age with Crohn's disease in remission. The primary outcome was maintenance of
      remission at various reported follow-up times during the study, up to 12 months
      following enrollment. Secondary outcomes included: time to relapse, mean change
      in CDAI, clinical, histological or endoscopic improvement, improvement in quality
      of life, adverse events and study withdrawal. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two
      independent investigators reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted the data
      and assessed study quality using Jadad's criteria. A random or fixed effects
      model was chosen based on an assessment of heterogeneity, and studies were
      weighted using the DerSimonian & Laird or the Mantel-Haenszel method accordingly.
      Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 4.2.10 software. MAIN RESULTS: Eleven
      studies were included in the review: 8 studies compared budesonide with placebo, 
      one compared budesonide to 5-aminosalicylates, one compared budesonide to
      traditional systemic corticosteroids, and one compared two doses of budesonide
      with no control group. Eight studies used a controlled ileal release form of
      budesonide, while three used a pH-modified release formulation. Budesonide 6 mg
      daily was no more effective than placebo for maintenance of remission at 3 months
      (RR 1.25; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.58; P = 0.05), 6 months (RR 1.15; 95% CI 0.95 to 1.39;
      P = 0.14), or 12 months (RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.35; P = 0.19). Budesonide was 
      not more effective than weaning doses of prednisolone for maintenance of
      remission at 12 months (RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.55 to 1.13; P = 0.20), but was better
      than mesalamine 3 grams per day (RR of remission 2.51; 95% CI 1.03 to 6.12; P =
      0.04). Budesonide 3 mg daily was more effective than placebo at 3 months (RR
      1.31; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.67; P = 0.03). This benefit was not sustained at 6 months 
      (RR 1.10; 95% CI 0.81 to 1.50; P = 0.53), or 12 months (RR 1.04; 95% CI 0.84 to
      1.30; P = 0.70). No differences in efficacy were detected based on the different 
      formulations of budesonide, methods used to induce remission, or budesonide dose.
      The use of budesonide 6 mg resulted in slight improvements in CDAI scores when
      assessed at 6 months (WMD -24.3; 95% CI -46.31 to -2.29; P = 0.03) and 12 months 
      (WMD -23.49; 95% CI -46.65 to -0.32; P = 0.05) and mean time to relapse of
      disease (WMD 59.93 days; 95% CI 19.02 to 100.84; P = 0.004). Adverse events were 
      more frequent in patients treated with 6 mg of budesonide compared with placebo
      (RR 1.49; 95% CI 1.01 to 2.19; P = 0.05), but not in patients using lower doses
      of budesonide. These events were relatively minor and did not result in increased
      rates of study withdrawal. Abnormal adrenocorticoid stimulation tests were seen
      more frequently in patients receiving both 6 mg daily (RR 2.88; 95% CI 1.72 to
      4.82; P < 0.0001) and 3 mg daily (RR 2.73; 95% CI 1.34 to 5.57; P = 0.006)
      compared with placebo. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Budesonide is not more effective
      than placebo or weaning prednisolone for maintenance of remission in Crohn's
      disease. Some modest benefits are noted in patients receiving budesonide compared
      with placebo in terms of lower CDAI scores and longer time to relapse of disease.
      However, these benefits are offset by higher treatment-related adverse event
      rates and more frequent adrenocorticoid suppression in patients receiving
      budesonide. Therefore, budesonide is not recommended for maintenance of remission
      in Crohn's disease.

      in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) following successful flare-up treatment.
      METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 122 patients
      received either mesalazine 50mg/kg per day (n=60) or placebo (n=62) for one year.
      Treatment allocation was stratified according to flare-up treatment (nutrition or
      medication alone). Recruitment was carried out over two periods, as the first
      period's results showed a trend favoring mesalazine. Relapse was defined as a
      Harvey-Bradshaw score more than or equal to 5. Time to relapse was analyzed using
      the Cox model. RESULTS: The one-year relapse rate was 57% (n=29) and 63% (n=35)
      in the mesalazine and placebo groups, respectively. We demonstrated a twofold
      lower relapse risk (P<0.02) in patients taking mesalazine in the medication
      stratum (first recruitment period), and a twofold higher risk in patients taking 
      mesalazine in the nutrition stratum (second recruitment period), compared with
      the other groups. None of the children's characteristics, which differed across
      the two recruitment periods, accounted for the between-period variation in
      mesalazine efficacy. One serious adverse event was reported in each treatment
      group. CONCLUSION: Overall, mesalazine does not appear to be an effective
      maintenance treatment in pediatric CD.

TI  - Folate concentrations in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed inflammatory
      bowel disease.
PG  - 545-50
LID - 10.3945/ajcn.2008.26576 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Folate is postulated to protect against cell injury and long-term
      risk of cancer. Folate deficiency has been shown to be associated with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, folate concentrations are poorly
      delineated in children with IBD. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare folate
      concentrations between children with newly diagnosed IBD and healthy controls.
      DESIGN: Red blood cell folate (RBCF) and whole-blood folate (WBF) concentrations 
      were measured in 78 children (mean age: 12.8 +/- 2.7 y): 22 patients with newly
      diagnosed untreated Crohn disease, 11 patients with ulcerative colitis, 4
      patients with indeterminate colitis, and 41 controls. Vitamin supplementation and
      dietary intakes determined by food-frequency questionnaire were recorded for 20
      IBD patients and 28 controls. RESULTS: RBCF concentrations were 19.4% lower in
      controls (587.0 +/- 148.6 ng/mL) than in patients (728.7 +/- 185.8 ng/mL; P =
      0.0004), and WBF concentrations were 11.1% lower in controls (218.2 +/- 49.7
      ng/mL) than in patients (245.3 +/- 59.1 ng/mL; P = 0.031). Total folate intake
      was 18.8% higher in controls (444.7 +/- 266.7 microg/d) than in IBD patients
      (361.1 +/- 230.6 microg/d), but this difference was not statistically significant
      (P = 0.264). Folate intakes were below the Recommended Dietary Allowance (200-400
      microg/d), adjusted for age and sex, in 35.4% of study subjects. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      contrast with previous evidence of folate deficiency in adult IBD patients, our
      data indicate higher folate concentrations in children with newly diagnosed
      untreated IBD than in controls. This finding was unexpected, especially in light 
      of the higher dietary folate intakes and hematocrit values in children without
      IBD. The influence of IBD therapy on folate metabolism and the long-term clinical
      implications of high RBCF and WBF concentrations at the time of IBD diagnosis
      should be explored further.

AB  - The enteral nutritional therapy for patients with Crohn disease in postoperative 
      period, as well as with left-sided colon resection and right colon resection was 
      assessed. The electromotor activity of the colon was examined before and after
      the Klinipit and the Mucofalk administration. The colon alterations correspond
      the intestinal failure clinical symptoms. This has been confirmed that the method
      of electromyography may be recommended for the noninvasive assessment of enteral 
      nutrition therapy of patients with colon hemicolectomy.

TI  - Colorectal cancer surveillance in inflammatory bowel disease: the search
      continues.
PG  - 61-6
AB  - Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at increased risk for
      colorectal cancer (CRC). Risk factors for the development of CRC in the setting
      of IBD include disease duration, anatomic extent of disease, age at time of
      diagnosis, severity of inflammation, family history of colon cancer, and
      concomitant primary sclerosing cholangitis. The current surveillance strategy of 
      surveillance colonoscopy with multiple random biopsies most likely reduces
      morbidity and mortality associated with IBD-related CRC. Unfortunately,
      surveillance colonoscopy also has severe limitations including high cost,
      sampling error at time of biopsy, and interobserver disagreement in
      histologically grading dysplasia. Furthermore, once dysplasia is detected there
      is disagreement about its management. Advances in endoscopic imaging techniques
      are already underway, and may potentially aid in dysplasia detection and improve 
      overall surveillance outcomes. Management of dysplasia depends predominantly on
      the degree and focality of dysplasia, with the mainstay of management involving
      either proctocolectomy or continued colonoscopic surveillance. Lastly, continued 
      research into additional chemopreventive agents may increase our arsenal in
      attempting to reduce the incidence of IBD-associated CRC.

TI  - Infliximab prevents Crohn's disease recurrence after ileal resection.
PG  - 441-50.e1; quiz 716
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2008.10.051 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Crohn's disease commonly recurs after intestinal resection. We
      evaluated whether the administration of infliximab after resective intestinal
      surgery for Crohn's disease reduces postoperative recurrence. METHODS: We
      randomly assigned 24 patients with Crohn's disease who had undergone ileocolonic 
      resection to receive intravenous infliximab (5 mg/kg), administered within 4
      weeks of surgery and continued for 1 year, or placebo. The primary end point was 
      the proportion of patients with endoscopic recurrence at 1 year. Secondary end
      points were clinical recurrence and remission and histologic recurrence. RESULTS:
      The rate of endoscopic recurrence at 1 year was significantly lower in the
      infliximab group (1 of 11 patients; 9.1%) compared with the placebo group (11 of 
      13 patients; 84.6%) (P = .0006). There was a nonsignificant higher proportion of 
      patients in clinical remission in the infliximab group (8 of 10; 80.0%) compared 
      with the placebo group (7 of 13; 53.8%) (P = .38). The histologic recurrence rate
      at 1 year was significantly lower in the infliximab group (3 of 11 patients;
      27.3%) compared with the placebo group (11 of 13 patients; 84.6%) (P = .01). The 
      occurrence of adverse events was similar between the placebo and infliximab
      groups, and none occurred in the immediate postoperative period. CONCLUSIONS:
      Administration of infliximab after intestinal resective surgery was effective at 
      preventing endoscopic and histologic recurrence of Crohn's disease.

TI  - Fecal calprotectin complements routine laboratory investigations in diagnosing
      childhood inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 756-9
LID - 10.1002/ibd.20820 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to study fecal calprotectin in Scottish children with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and compare its diagnostic accuracy with blood
      parameters. METHODS: Stool samples from 48 Scottish children (29 males, 19
      females) had calprotectin measured at IBD diagnosis. The median age at diagnosis 
      was 11.2 years (interquartile range [IQR] 8.7-13.0 years). There were 33 patients
      with Crohn's disease, 5 with ulcerative colitis, and 10 with IBD type
      unspecified. IBD was diagnosed by standard criteria. Calprotectin was measured
      using a commercially available kit (PhiCal Test) and 47/48 patients had
      comparative blood results available at diagnosis. RESULTS: The fecal calprotectin
      concentrations were raised in 96% (46/48) of patients studied. The median
      calprotectin value was 750 microg/g (IQR 235.8-1251 microug/g). In comparison
      with standard blood tests, 32/45 (71.1%) had abnormal erythrocyte sedimentation
      rate, 19/38 (50.0%) had abnormal C-reactive protein, 29/46 (63.0%) had raised
      platelets, 12/45 (26.7%) had hypoalbuminemia, and 38/46 (82.6%) had abnormal
      hemoglobin. We identified 7/47 (14.9%) patients with raised calprotectin at
      diagnosis who did not have any abnormalities detected in the blood tests
      performed. All 48 patients (100%) had at least 1 abnormal blood test and/or
      raised calprotectin at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Calprotectin is significantly more
      likely to be raised than any commonly employed blood tests at IBD diagnosis. When
      used in combination with these bloods tests an abnormality was demonstrated in 1 
      or both tests in all patients at diagnosis in this study. Fecal calprotectin
      measurement is a significant advance when used contemporaneously and in addition 
      to a routine panel of blood tests in the diagnosis of pediatric IBD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Infliximab therapy has short-term benefits in children with
      moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease (CD). We assessed the long-term outcome of
      infliximab maintenance therapy in children with CD. METHODS: We performed a
      multicenter cohort study of 729 pediatric patients with CD enrolled in the
      Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease Collaborative Research Group Registry.
      Children younger than 16 years and newly diagnosed with CD were eligible for this
      study. Disease and medication information were collected prospectively from the
      treating physician at diagnosis, 30 days, and quarterly thereafter. No
      interventions were specified, per protocol. RESULTS: In all, 202 of 729 patients 
      received infliximab: 62%, 23%, and 15% within 1, 1-2, and >2 years of diagnosis, 
      respectively. The mean age at infliximab initiation was 12.7 years. A total of
      158 infliximab-treated patients received maintenance therapy, 29 episodic (8
      converted to maintenance), and 15 had incomplete follow-up. Among 128 patients
      administered maintenance infliximab and followed for >or=1 year, concomitant
      medications at infliximab initiation included corticosteroids (52%) and
      immunomodulators (90%). By 1, 2, and 3 years, <10% of patients continuing on
      maintenance infliximab were receiving corticosteroids (P < 0.001). Following
      maintenance therapy initiation, 26%, 44%, and 33% of patients continuing on
      maintenance infliximab over 0-1, 1-2, and 2-3 years, respectively, had clinically
      inactive disease not requiring corticosteroids or surgery. The likelihood of
      continuing maintenance infliximab at 1, 2, and 3 years was 93%, 78%, and 67%,
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab maintenance therapy was a durable and
      effective treatment that was associated with prolonged corticosteroid withdrawal 
      over a 3-year period in children with CD.

TI  - Effects of light smoking consumption on the clinical course of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 734-41
LID - 10.1002/ibd.20828 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking is associated with a more severe Crohn's disease
      (CD) course. However, the effect of light consumption is not known. Our aim was
      to characterize the effect of a light tobacco consumption on the course of CD.
      METHODS: We analyzed the course of CD during the period 1995-2007 from data
      collected in 2795 consecutive patients in whom smoking habits were recorded.
      Patients were classified as nonsmokers (n = 1420), light smokers (1-10
      cigarettes/day; n = 385), heavy smokers (>10 cigarettes/day; n = 638), and
      intermittent smokers (change in smoking habits; n = 352). Patient-years while
      smoking were compared to patient-years without smoking. The analyses considered
      patient-years regarding annual disease activity and therapeutic requirements.
      RESULTS: The percentage of years with active disease was 37% in nonsmokers versus
      46% in light smokers (P < 0.001; adjusted hazard ratio 1.30 [1.19-1.43]) and 48% 
      in heavy smokers (P < 0.001; adjusted hazard ratio 1.68 [1.57-1.81]), despite an 
      increased use of immunosuppressants in smokers. Hospitalization rates were also
      increased in both groups of smokers, with 12% in nonsmokers versus 15% in both
      groups of smokers (P < 0.001 for both comparisons). The annual rate of intestinal
      resection was 4.5% in nonsmokers, 5.1% in light smokers, and 5.5% in heavy
      smokers, with a significant difference observed between nonsmokers and heavy
      smokers only (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Light smokers are doing worse than
      nonsmokers regarding disease activity and the need for immunosuppressants.
      Complete smoking cessation should be advised in all smokers with CD.

TI  - Efficacy of infliximab in pediatric Crohn's disease: a randomized multicenter
      open-label trial comparing scheduled to on demand maintenance therapy.
PG  - 388-94
LID - 10.1002/ibd.20788 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infliximab (IFX) is efficacious in inducing remission in severe forms
      of pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). Adult studies indicate that IFX is also safe
      and well tolerated as maintenance therapy. The present study aimed to evaluate in
      a prospective manner the efficacy and safety of IFX as maintenance therapy of
      severe pediatric CD comparing scheduled and "on demand" treatment strategies.
      METHODS: Forty children with CD (nonpenetrating, nonstricturing as well as
      penetrating forms, mean age: 13.9 +/- 2.2 years) with a severe flare-up
      (Harvey-Bradshaw Index [HBI] > or =5, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] >20
      mm/h) despite well-conducted immunomodulator therapy (n = 36 azathioprine, n = 1 
      mercaptopurine, n = 3 methotrexate) combined with steroids were included in this 
      randomized, multicenter, open-label study. Three IFX infusions (5 mg/kg) were
      administered at week (W)0/W2/W6. At W10, clinical remission (HBI <5) and steroid 
      withdrawal were analyzed and IFX responders were randomized to maintenance
      therapy over 1 year: group A, scheduled every 2 months; group B, "on demand" on
      relapse. RESULTS: In all, 34/40 children came into remission during IFX induction
      therapy (HBI: 6.7 +/- 2.5 (WO) vs. 1.1 +/- 1.5 (W10); P < 0.001). At the end of
      phase 2, 15/18 (83%) patients were in remission in group A compared to 8/13 (61%)
      children in group B (P < 0.01), with a mean HBI of 0.5 versus 3.2 points (group A
      versus B, P = 0.011). In group A, 3/13 (23.1%) children experienced a relapse
      compared to 11/12 (92%) children in group B. No severe adverse event occurred
      during this trial. CONCLUSIONS: IFX is well tolerated and safe as maintenance
      therapy for pediatric CD, with a clear advantage when used on a scheduled 2-month
      basis compared to an "on demand" basis.

TI  - Course and treatment of perianal disease in children newly diagnosed with Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 383-7
LID - 10.1002/ibd.20767 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We sought to characterize perianal disease and its treatment in
      pediatric patients newly diagnosed with Crohn's disease. METHODS: Data were
      obtained from the Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Collaborative Group 
      Registry, a prospective, multicenter observational registry recording clinical
      and laboratory outcomes in children under 16 years of age newly diagnosed with
      IBD. Patients with Crohn's disease were selected who had data on perianal disease
      and at least 24 months of follow-up. The records of patients with a Pediatric
      Crohn's Disease Activity Index perianal subscore greater than 0 were reviewed,
      and patients with abscesses or fistulas were selected. The therapies used and the
      course of their perianal disease were then assessed. RESULTS: Of the 276 patients
      identified, 41 had perianal lesions within 30 days of diagnosis. Thirteen of
      these had skin tags and fissures only, whereas 28 had fistulas and/or abscesses. 
      The latter lesions resolved by 1 year in 20 patients, and 8 had chronic/recurrent
      perianal disease persisting for more than 1 year following diagnosis. Patients
      with fistulizing disease were much more likely to be treated and were treated
      earlier with antibiotics, infliximab, and immunomodulators than were
      nonfistulizing patients. Patients who developed chronic perianal disease were
      more likely to have low body mass indices and required more perianal surgery than
      did patients whose perianal disease resolved. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 10% of
      newly diagnosed pediatric patients with Crohn's disease will have perianal
      fistulas and/or abscesses at the time of diagnosis. Most of these will resolve
      within a year with medical therapy alone.

TI  - The ErbB4 growth factor receptor is required for colon epithelial cell survival
      in the presence of TNF.
PG  - 217-26
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2008.09.023 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The ErbB4 receptor tyrosine kinase regulates cell growth,
      survival, and differentiation in several tissues, but its role in the
      gastrointestinal tract has not been reported. We tested the hypothesis that ErbB4
      promotes intestinal cell survival and restitution following injury or
      inflammation. METHODS: ErbB4 expression in human inflammatory bowel disease was
      determined by immunohistochemistry. Mice were subjected to dextran sulfate sodium
      (DSS, 3%) colitis or injected with tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and ErbB4
      expression was quantified by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Cultured
      young adult mouse colon (YAMC) cells were exposed to TNF, and ErbB4 messenger
      RNA, protein, and phosphorylation levels were measured. Cells transfected with
      ErbB4 small interfering RNA (siRNA), or over expressing ErbB4, were subjected to 
      wound healing and apoptosis assays. RESULTS: ErbB4 levels increased in Crohn's
      colitis and the colon epithelium of mice with DSS colitis or injected with TNF.
      In YAMC cells, TNF induced ErbB4 messenger RNA, protein, and phosphorylation;
      nuclear factor kappaB activation also stimulated ErbB4 accumulation. ErbB4 siRNA 
      sensitized cells to TNF-stimulated apoptosis, while over expression blocked
      apoptosis induced by TNF plus cycloheximide. Additionally, ErbB4 siRNA decreased 
      YAMC cell wound healing. ErbB4 knockdown attenuated, while over expression
      elevated, phosphorylation of Akt in response to TNF. Inhibition of the
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling cascade reversed the ability of ErbB4
      over expression to protect from cytokine-induced apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: ErbB4
      expression and signaling are key elements for TNF responses in vivo and in cell
      culture, protecting intestinal epithelial cells from apoptosis in the
      inflammatory environment, possibly through Akt activation.

TI  - Circulating adipokines and the protective effects of hyperinsulinemia in
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 172-81
LID - 10.1016/j.nut.2008.07.020 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Adipokines are fat-derived hormones and cytokines with
      immune-modulating and metabolic properties. Most of them are associated with
      insulin resistance. The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate
      circulating levels of adipokines and glucose homeostasis in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and to evaluate possible associations with the
      course and characteristics of the disease. METHODS: Serum leptin, resistin,
      visfatin, retinol-binding protein-4, adiponectin, glucose, insulin, and
      inflammatory parameters were analyzed in 93 patients with inactive IBD (49 with
      Crohn's disease [CD], 44 with ulcerative colitis [UC]), 35 patients with active
      IBD (18 with CD, 17 with UC), and 37 age- and body mass index-matched healthy
      controls. Ninety-two patients were followed for 6 mo. RESULTS: Leptin was similar
      in patients with IBD and controls, whereas resistin and visfatin were increased
      in patients with active disease but not in those in remission. In active and
      inactive disease, adiponectin was decreased (P < 0.001) and retinol-binding
      protein-4 was increased (P < 0.001) compared with controls. About 60% of patients
      with IBD showed increased levels of insulin, whereas serum glucose remained
      normal, resulting in increased homeostasis model assessment values in most
      patients. Hyperinsulinemia was associated with the decrease in adiponectin (r =
      -0.572, P < 0.001) and proved to be an independent protective factor for 6-mo
      maintenance of remission (P = 0.016). CONCLUSION: IBD led to largely similar
      alterations in circulating adipokines and hyperinsulinemia in patients with CD
      and those with UC. The unexpected protective effect of hyperinsulinemia on
      relapse rate denotes the role of the metabolic-inflammatory response as a
      modulator in IBD.

TI  - High prevalence of vitamin K and D deficiency and decreased BMD in inflammatory
      bowel disease.
PG  - 935-42
LID - 10.1007/s00198-008-0764-2 [doi]
AB  - SUMMARY: Vitamin K and D deficiency and decreased bone mineral density (BMD) were
      highly prevalent in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially
      Crohn's disease (CD). Dietary intakes of these vitamins, however, were above the 
      Japanese adequate intakes in IBD patients, suggesting that malabsorption is the
      basis for hypovitaminosis K and D and decreased BMD. INTRODUCTION: We have
      studied the possible involvement of vitamin K and D deficiency in the
      pathogenesis of decreased BMD in IBD. METHODS: Seventy patients with IBD were
      evaluated for their BMD; plasma levels of vitamin K; phylloquinone (PK),
      menaquinone-7 (MK-7), and 25OH-D; serum PTH, protein induced by vitamin K absence
      (PIVKA-II), and undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) levels; and their food
      intake. RESULTS: Compared with ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, CD patients had 
      significantly lower plasma vitamin K and 25OH-D concentrations; significantly
      higher serum levels of PTH, PIVKA-II, and ucOC; and significantly lower BMD
      scores at almost all measurement sites. More IBD patients were vitamin K
      deficient in bone than in liver. Multiple regression analyses revealed that low
      plasma concentrations of vitamin K and 25OH-D were independent risk factors for
      low BMD and that they were associated with the patients' fat intake, but not with
      their intake of these vitamins. CONCLUSION: IBD patients have high prevalence of 
      decreased BMD and vitamin K and D deficiency probably caused by malabsorption of 
      these vitamins.

TI  - Positive impact of blocking tumor necrosis factor alpha on the nutritional status
      in pediatric Crohn's disease patients.
PG  - 19-25
LID - 10.1007/s00384-008-0578-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: TNFalpha seems to contribute to inflammation and malnutrition in
      Crohn's disease (CD) patients. In CD patients, the comparative effects on
      nutritional status of infliximab and traditional therapy have not yet been
      determined. The aim of our study was to assess the effects of infliximab as
      compared with those of standard therapy on nutritional status, disease activity, 
      resting energy expenditure (REE), and food intake in CD children and adolescents.
      METHODS: From September 1999 to September 2005, all CD patients treated with
      infliximab (group A) were reviewed and matched with CD patients treated with
      traditional therapy (mesalazine and azathioprine) (group B). RESULTS: Fourteen CD
      patients from group A and 14 from group B were included; median interval before
      follow-up investigation was 10 months. Baseline and final values of weight,
      height, body mass index (BMI), pediatric CD activity index (pCDAI), REE, and food
      intake were studied. In treated patients, but not in control group, mean baseline
      weight (kg) and BMI values, 39.7 +/- 13.1 and 17.9 +/- 3.3, respectively, were
      significantly lower than their final values 42.6 +/- 13.2 and 18.9 +/- 3.1, and
      median pCDAI values 23.5 were significantly higher than their final values 10 (P 
      < 0.05). Significant changes in height, REE, and food intake were not found in
      either group. CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric CD patients, infliximab seems to impact
      positively on the nutritional status as demonstrated by the improvement in weight
      and BMI, but not in linear growth; effects on nutritional status seem to be due
      to amelioration of disease activity, rather than to REE reduction or food intake 
      increase.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is often associated with malnutrition. The aim
      of this study was to compare the body composition of outpatients with IBD during 
      remission and active phase. In order to evaluate disease activity we used Crohn's
      Disease Activity Index for Crohn's disease (CD) patients and Lichtiger's Index
      for ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. All patients underwent the analysis of BMI,
      arm muscle area (AMA) and triceps plus subscapula skinfold thickness (TST+SST) to
      identify total, muscle and fat mass, respectively. In total 102 patients were
      evaluated (CD, n 50; UC, n 52) and the majority was young women. Malnutrition
      according to BMI was found in 14.0 % of patients with CD and 5.7 % of UC
      patients. Muscle mass depletion was detected in more than half of the CD and UC
      patients. The BMI, TST+SST and AMA values were lower in the active phase only in 
      CD patients (P < 0.05). Fat mass depletion was associated with active phase in
      both CD and UC patients. Body composition parameters obtained using BMI, TST+SST 
      and AMA were not correlated with the presence of fistula in CD patients (P>0.05).
      In conclusion, patients without signs of malnutrition had fat mass depletion
      especially in the active phase and muscle mass depletion occurred both in CD and 
      UC patients.

TI  - Development of extraintestinal manifestations in pediatric patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 63-8
LID - 10.1002/ibd.20604 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) in pediatric patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are poorly characterized. We examined the
      prevalence of EIMs at diagnosis, subsequent incidence, and risk factors for EIMs.
      METHODS: Data for 1649 patients from the PediIBD Consortium Registry, diagnosed
      with IBD before 18 years of age (1007 [61%] with Crohn's disease, 471 [29%] with 
      ulcerative colitis, and 171 [10%] with indeterminate colitis), were analyzed
      using logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier, log rank tests, and Cox models. RESULTS:
      EIMs were reported prior to IBD diagnosis in 97 of 1649 patients (6%). Older
      children at diagnosis had higher rates compared with younger children, and
      arthritis (26%) and aphthous stomatitis (21%) were most common. Among the 1552
      patients without EIM at diagnosis, 290 developed at least 1 EIM. Kaplan-Meier
      estimates of cumulative incidence were 9% at 1 year, 19% at 5 years, and 29% at
      15 years after diagnosis. Incidence did not differ by IBD type (P = 0.20), age at
      diagnosis (P = 0.22), or race/ethnicity (P = 0.24). Arthritis (17%) and
      osteopenia/osteoporosis (15%) were the most common EIMs after IBD diagnosis.
      CONCLUSIONS: In our large cohort of pediatric IBD patients, 6% had at least 1 EIM
      before diagnosis of IBD. At least 1 EIM will develop in 29% within 15 years of
      diagnosis. The incidence of EIMs both before and after diagnosis of IBD differs
      by type of EIM and may be slightly higher in girls, but is independent of the
      type of IBD, age at diagnosis, and race/ethnicity.

TI  - Body mass and composition affect bone density in recently diagnosed inflammatory 
      bowel disease: the Manitoba IBD Cohort Study.
PG  - 39-46
LID - 10.1002/ibd.20541 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This prospective study was undertaken to clarify the role of body
      mass and composition as a determinant of bone mineral density (BMD) in recently
      diagnosed inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: A nested subgroup of 101
      adult subjects of the population-based Manitoba IBD Cohort Study were enrolled.
      Baseline BMD and body composition were measured and repeated 2.3 +/- 0.3 years
      later. RESULTS: Greater weight, height, and body mass measurements were
      positively correlated with bone density at all sites (P < 0.01). Although both
      fat tissue and lean tissue showed positive relationships with BMD, lean tissue
      showed a much stronger correlation than fat tissue, especially for the total hip 
      (r = 0.66, P < 0.001 versus r = 0.23, P < 0.05) and total body measurements (r = 
      0.59, P < 0.001 versus r = 0.04, P NS). Increase (or decrease) in hip bone
      density was strongly associated with an increase (or decrease) in all body mass
      variables (r = 0.49-0.54, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Measures of body mass are
      important determinants of baseline BMD in recently diagnosed IBD patients.
      Furthermore, change in body mass is correlated with change in BMD, especially at 
      the total hip. Early optimization and maintenance of nutrition and body weight,
      particularly toward lean tissue mass, may play an important role in preventing
      IBD-related bone disease.

TI  - IBD and IBD mimicking enterocolitis in children younger than 2 years of age.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is uncommon in children younger than 2 years of 
      age. The criteria for differentiating IBD from other diseases with similar
      clinical presentation is unclear. We describe 16 patients who, between 1984 and
      2004, received a histological diagnosis of IBD during the first two years of
      life. Six patients presented with histological Crohn's disease, eight with
      ulcerative colitis and two with indeterminate colitis. The median age at
      diagnosis was 125 days (range 1 day to 18 months) and the medium follow up was 89
      months (range 65 days to 20 years). The disease appeared to be very severe: four 
      children (25%) underwent total parenteral nutrition (TPN), two received colectomy
      (12.5%) and three patients died. Many of the patients required an aggressive,
      multidrug, immunosuppressive approach (azathioprine [AZA], Infliximab,
      thalidomide, cyclosporine A). One child presented with a hypogammaglobulinaemia
      without any specific immunodeficiency, while in the other patients,
      Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) (4 cases) and chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) 
      (2 cases) were identified. In 6/16 cases, allergic colitis was first considered; 
      these cases initially underwent cow's milk protein-free diet as the only therapy 
      before IBD was finally diagnosed. In conclusion, early IBD has a severe prognosis
      and often needs an aggressive therapeutic approach. Furthermore, an improper
      diagnosis of allergic colitis might cause an important diagnostic delay. Some
      severe immunodeficiencies, such as WAS and CGD, may represent a problem in terms 
      of differential diagnosis and might be wrongly diagnosed as very early onset IBD.
