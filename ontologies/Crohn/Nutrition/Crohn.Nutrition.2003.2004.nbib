TI  - Fever and right upper quadrant pain in a pregnant woman at 30 weeks' gestation.
PG  - 113-6; quiz 1 p following 116
AB  - BACKGROUND: A 34-year-old gravid woman with a history of ileal Crohn's disease
      presented at 30 weeks' gestation with a 2-week history of fever and right upper
      quadrant pain. An intra-abdominal abscess was suspected. Ultrasound and MRI
      failed to demonstrate the suspected abscess. Owing to ongoing pain and fever, the
      risk to the fetus of a CT scan were discussed with the patient, obstetricians and
      radiologists, with considerable debate about the possibility of other
      explanations for her symptoms. Ultimately, a CT scan revealed marked thickening
      of the distal ileum and confirmed diagnosis of an abscess in continuity with the 
      inflamed bowel. INVESTIGATIONS: Ultrasound, MRI, CT scan, urinalysis, urine
      culture and liver function tests. DIAGNOSIS: Crohn's disease flare complicated by
      an intra-abdominal abscess. MANAGEMENT: Antibiotics (ceftizoxime, metronidazole
      and amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium), parenteral nutrition and ileocecectomy.

TI  - [Artificial nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease].
PG  - 629-34
AB  - Malnutrition is often a major clinical problem in patients affected by IBD.
      Assessment of nutritional status should be routinely carried out in these
      patients and, in case of severe malnutrition, artificial nutrition should be
      used. In ulcerative colitis and in Crohn disease localized to colonic segments
      both Parenteral Nutrition (PN) and Enteral Nutrition (EN) have similar results as
      support treatments but they have no primary therapeutic effects and then they are
      indicated only in case of severe malnutrition and/or when a surgical procedure is
      planned. Some theoretical advantages derived from supplementation of short chain 
      fatty acids and omega3-series is still debated. More evident are the advantages
      of nutritional support in Crohn enteritis. Both PN and EN have a role as a
      primary therapy capable to induce remission although these results are not
      prolonged in time when nutrition is not associated with pharmacological
      treatments. Experiments of pharmaco-nutrition with glutamine and fish fatty acid 
      have to be validated in the clinical practice. In case of integrity of the small 
      bowel and tolerance of the patient, EN is preferable to PN for its lower costs
      and reduced related complications. PN is still indicated in more severe cases or 
      in acute phase when the need of restoring rapidly the hydroelectrolitic and
      nitrogen/caloric balance prevails.

TI  - Crohn's disease over 20 years after diagnosis in a referral population.
PG  - 1233-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Patients frequently ask questions about the lifetime prognosis of
      Crohn's disease. The aim of this study was to describe the outcomes of Crohn's
      disease more than 20 years after diagnosis. METHODS: Data from all patients with 
      Crohn's disease whose diagnosis had been performed before 1st January 1978 were
      analyzed. All referred patients filled in a medical and health-related
      quality-of-life questionnaire. RESULTS: Among 273 patients with Crohn's disease
      diagnosed more than 20 years ago, 141 (52%) patients answered our questionnaire, 
      45 (16%) patients were alive but did not wish to answer our questionnaire, 51
      (19%) could not be traced and 36 (13%) died before July 1998. At the end of
      follow-up, 25.7 (20.0-59.3) years after diagnosis, 24% had a relapse in the
      previous 12 months, and 48% and 28% had quiescent disease with and without
      treatment, respectively. These ratios were not different from those observed
      three years after Crohn's disease diagnosis. Sixteen patients died within 20
      years after CD diagnosis, including 11 from CD-related causes. The risk of death 
      estimated by Kaplan-Meier life-tables analysis was non-significantly higher if
      death was related to CD. An ileal or colic adenocarcinoma was noted in 6 (3.4%)
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: Crohn's disease activity does not burn out with time, and 
      roughly one-quarter of the patients had active disease 20 years after diagnosis.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerance of infliximab in children and adolescents with Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 745-50
AB  - Infliximab, a monoclonal antibody against tumor necrosis factor-alpha, has been
      shown to be effective for the treatment of refractory Crohn's disease in adult
      patients, but experience in pediatrics is limited. This retrospective study
      included 88 children and adolescents, 39 girls and 49 boys, with a median age of 
      14 years (range 3.3-17.9). Infliximab was indicated for active disease (66%)
      and/or fistulas (42%) that were refractory to corticosteroids (70%), and/or other
      immunosuppressive (82%) agents, and/or parenteral nutrition (20%). Patients
      received 1 to 17 infusions (median 4) of 5 mg/kg (range 3.8-7.3) of infliximab
      during a median time period of 4 months (1-17 months). Infusion reaction was
      noted in 13 patients (15%), with a total of 16 reactions in 450 infusions (4%).
      At Day 90 after the first infusion of infliximab, symptoms improved in 49% of
      patients, whereas 29% of patients were in remission and 13% of patients relapsed.
      From Day 0 to Day 90, Harvey-Bradshaw score decreased from 7.5 to 2.8 (P <
      0.001), C-reactive protein from 36 to 16 mg/L (P < 0.01), and 1-hour erythrocyte 
      sedimentation rate from 35 to 17 mm (P < 0.01). Dosage of corticosteroids
      decreased from to 0.59 to 0.17 mg/kg/d (P < 0.001); 53% of patients could be
      weaned of corticosteroids and 92% of parenteral nutrition. Treatment with
      infliximab is well tolerated and effective in most children and adolescents with 
      Crohn's disease that is refractory to conventional immunosuppressive therapy.
      Nevertheless, long-term efficacy remains to be shown, and further studies are
      urgently needed to precisely determine the best modality of continuing treatment.

PG  - 168-73
AB  - Six patients with active Crohn's disease (CD) unresponsive to conventional
      medications (CM) were treated with Monocyte-granulocytapheresis (M-GCAP). CD
      patients who scored 200-400 points in Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) in
      spite of receiving CM, including enteral nutrition, for at least 2 weeks were
      enrolled in our double series trial. Each series had 5 weekly M-GCAP and 2
      follow-up weeks, and each M-GCAP treated 1,800 ml of patient's peripheral blood. 
      After the 1st series, patients who decreased more than 50 points on the CDAI were
      deemed responders and enrolled in the second series. Patients with a CDAI score
      less than 150 points were considered in remission. The patients' quality of life 
      was evaluated using an index (IBDQ) before and after the 1st series. The CDAI was
      significantly decreased comparing before and after the 1st series (258.2 +/- 36.2
      vs. 166.5 +/- 16.6; P < 0.02). 50% of patients (3/6) responded to the therapy,
      and one case (16.7%) could be induced to remission. Significant removal was
      revealed only for white blood cells (25.6 +/- 16.9%; P < 0.05), especially
      granulocytes (29.5 +/- 22.5%; P < 0.05). A statistically significant improvement 
      of IBDQ was revealed in the responders' group (162.3 +/- 17.2 vs. 189.3 +/- 11.5;
      P < 0.03). M-GCAP could be an effective adjunctive therapy for active CD patients
      unresponsive to CM allowing them to maintain a high QOL. However, it might be
      difficult to improve patients who could not be induced to remission after the 1st
      series by applying another series.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of tumor necrosis factor antagonists in Crohn's disease:
      overview of randomized clinical studies.
PG  - S18-24
AB  - The past decade has brought forth a series of novel biologic agents targeting
      tumor necrosis factor (TNF) for the treatment of Crohn's disease. The
      introduction of infliximab has paved the way for additional anti-TNF strategies
      that have the potential to build on that drug's efficacy and safety profile.
      However, the anti-TNF strategies might not have identical efficacy and safety
      profiles and might differ in dosing compared with therapy for rheumatoid
      arthritis. Most recently, adalimumab has been approved by the US Food and Drug
      Administration for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and is undergoing
      evaluation in Crohn's disease, with promising initial results. This review
      discusses the results of controlled clinical trials of anti-TNF agents for
      Crohn's disease.

TI  - Serologic testing with ANCA, ASCA, and anti-OmpC in children and young adults
      with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis: diagnostic value and correlation
      with disease phenotype.
PG  - 2235-41
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Serologic testing is increasingly being utilized to evaluate children
      with suspected inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of this paper was to
      evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of a currently available panel involving
      four antibodies: deoxyribonuclease (DNase)-sensitive perinuclear antineutrophil
      cytoplasmic antibody (DNase-sensitive pANCA), IgA and IgG antibodies to
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae (IgA and IgG ASCA), and antibody to Escherichia coli
      outer membrane porin (anti-OmpC). We also wished to determine whether antibody
      levels correlated with disease activity, and whether a specific antibody pattern 
      correlated with location and outcome of disease in children. METHODS: We studied 
      sera from 81 children with Crohn's disease (CD), 54 with ulcerative colitis (UC),
      and 63 controls. Clinical data, disease activity, and disease diagnosis were
      gathered at the time of serum sampling, and charts were re-reviewed at time of
      the study to determine long-term outcome. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was
      utilized to determine titers of antibodies to ASCA, DNase-sensitive pANCA, and
      anti-OmpC; the presence of perinuclear staining for ANCA was confirmed by
      immunofluorescence. RESULTS: We identified ASCA antibodies in 44% of CD patients,
      0% of UC patients, and 1 control patient. DNase-sensitive pANCA antibodies were
      found in 70% of patients with UC, 18% of CD patients (predominantly Crohn's
      colitis), and 3% of controls. Anti-OmpC as an isolated assay had low sensitivity 
      for both CD (24%) and UC (11%), and displayed a 5% false-positive rate. However, 
      anti-OmpC did identify a small number of IBD patients not detected by the other
      assays. If any one or more of the four antibodies was positive, the overall
      sensitivity of the four antibody panel was 65% for CD and 76% for UC, with a
      specificity of 94%. Patients who were ASCA-positive were more likely to have
      disease of the ileum or ileum and right colon than patients who were
      ASCA-negative (58%vs 18%, p < 0.001). Patients with ASCA-positive were also more 
      likely to require ileocecal resection (36%vs 13%, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A
      currently available commercial antibody panel has good sensitivity and excellent 
      specificity for CD and UC. The ASCA antibodies, while highly specific for CD,
      identify predominantly the subset of children with disease of the ileum and
      ascending colon who may be at increased risk of surgery.

TI  - Vitamin K status in patients with Crohn's disease and relationship to bone
      turnover.
PG  - 2178-85
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a high prevalence of osteopenia among patients with Crohn's 
      disease (CD). There is some evidence that a deficiency of certain bone-active
      nutrients (including vitamins K and D) may have a partial role in this bone loss.
      AIMS: To compare the intake and the status of vitamin K in CD patients, currently
      in remission, with age- and sex-matched controls, and furthermore to investigate 
      the relationship between vitamin K status and bone turnover in these patients.
      SUBJECTS: CD patients (n = 44; mean age: 36.9 yr) and matched controls (n = 44)
      were recruited from the Cork University Hospital and Cork City area,
      respectively. METHODS: Bloods were analyzed for the total and undercarboxylated
      (Glu)-osteocalcin and urine analyzed for cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I
      collagen (NTx). Vitamin K(1) intake was estimated by food frequency
      questionnaire. RESULTS: Vitamin K(1) intake in CD patients tended to be lower
      than that of controls (mean (SD), 117 (82) vs 148 (80) mug/d, respectively; p=
      0.059). Glu and NTx concentrations in CD patients were higher than controls (mean
      (SD), 5.1 (3.1) vs 3.9 (2.1) ng/ml, respectively; p= 0.03 for Glu; and 49 (41) vs
      25.8 (19.5) nM BCE/mM creatinine, respectively; p= 0.001 for NTx). In CD
      patients, Glu was significantly correlated with NTx (r= 0.488; p < 0.001), even
      after controlling for age, gender, vitamin D status, calcium intake, and
      corticosteroid use. CONCLUSION: Vitamin K status of CD patients was lower than
      that of the healthy controls. Furthermore, the rate of bone resorption in the CD 
      was inversely correlated with vitamin K status, suggesting that it might be
      another etiological factor for CD-related osteopenia.

TI  - Reduced joint pain after short-term duodenal administration of seal oil in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease: comparison with soy oil.
PG  - 1088-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rheumatic joint pain is a common extra-intestinal complication of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Because the high ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty
      acids (FAs) of the Western diet might promote rheumatic disorders, we sought to
      compare the effects of short-term duodenal administration of n-3-rich seal oil
      and n-6-rich soy oil on IBD-related joint pain. METHODS: Nineteen patients with
      IBD-related joint pain were included in the study; 9 had Crohn disease and 10 had
      ulcerative colitis. Ten millilitres seal oil (n = 10) or soy oil (n = 9) was
      self-administered through a nasoduodenal feeding tube 3 times daily for 10 days. 
      RESULTS: Compared with soy oil treatment, seal oil significantly reduced the
      duration of morning stiffness (P = 0.024), number of tender joints (P = 0.035),
      intensity of pain (P = 0.025) and the doctor's scoring of rheumatic disease
      activity (P = 0.025) at the end of the 10-day treatment period. Analysis of the
      effects as area under the curve (area between the curve and baseline, zero) for
      the entire period from start of treatment until 6 months' post-treatment
      suggested a long-lasting beneficial effect of seal oil administration on joint
      pain, whereas soy oil tended (not significantly) to aggravate the condition.
      Consistently, the serum ratios of n-6 to n-3 FAs (P < 0.01) and arachidonic acid 
      to eicosapentaenoic acid (P < 0.01) were reduced after treatment with seal oil.
      CONCLUSION: The results suggest distinctive, differential prolonged effects on
      IBD-related joint pain of short-term duodenal administration of n-3-rich seal oil
      (significant improvement) and n-6-rich soy oil (tendency to exacerbation).

PG  - 753-9
AB  - Fifty-three patients with Crohn disease were included in a prospective study.
      Bone mineral density was measured at the femoral neck and lumbar spine by
      dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Ten variables were analyzed in search of an
      association with bone demineralization; Age, sex, nutritional state, smoking,
      duration of the disease, hormonal status, inflammatory syndrome, site of disease:
      ileal, colic or ileocolic, accumulated doses of corticoids and intestinal
      resection. A bone demineralization was observed in 58.5% of cases. The ileum
      location and the corticotherapie were predictives of bone demineralization. Crohn
      disease is a disease at high risk of bone demineralization. Predictors of the
      bone loss were smoking, long duration of the disease, ileal site and systematic
      corticotherapy.

TI  - Fish oil and antioxidants alter the composition and function of circulating
      mononuclear cells in Crohn disease.
PG  - 1137-44
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn disease (CD) is associated with osteoporosis and other
      extraintestinal manifestations that might be mediated by cytokines from
      circulating (peripheral blood) mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Fish oil rich in
      eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) reduces disease
      activity in patients with CD with raised laboratory markers of inflammation and
      in healthy subjects alters PBMC function. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effect
      of fish oil plus antioxidants on cytokine production by PBMCs from patients with 
      CD with raised C-reactive protein concentrations (>/=6.9 mg/L) or erythrocyte
      sedimentation rates (>/=18 mm/h). DESIGN: A randomized placebo-controlled trial
      of fish oil (2.7 g EPA and DHA/d; n = 31) or placebo (olive oil; n = 31) for 24
      wk was conducted in patients with CD. The fish-oil group additionally received an
      antioxidant preparation (vitamins A, C, and E and selenium). Exclusion criteria
      included corticosteroid use. Fatty acid composition was measured by gas
      chromatography. Production of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma
      (IFN-gamma), and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) was measured by enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assays after stimulation with mitogen and endotoxin
      (lipopolysaccharide). RESULTS: Fish-oil plus antioxidant dietary supplementation 
      was associated with higher EPA and DHA incorporation into PBMCs (P < 0.001) and
      lower arachidonic acid (P = 0.006) and lower production of IFN-gamma by
      mitogen-stimulated PBMCs (P = 0.012) and of PGE(2) by
      lipopolysaccharide-stimulated PBMCs (P = 0.047). CONCLUSION: Dietary
      supplementation with fish oil plus antioxidants is associated with modified PBMC 
      composition and lower production of PGE(2) and IFN-gamma by circulating monocytes
      or macrophages. The response of extraintestinal manifestations of CD should be
      investigated in a randomized controlled trial.

TI  - Relevance of serologic studies in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 482-7
AB  - The serologic panel for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is rapidly expanding.
      Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae
      mannan antibodies (ASCA) have remained the most widely studied markers, but
      immune reactivity against a new group of bacterial antigens such as I2, OmpC
      (outer membrane porin C), and flagellin, has been described in Crohn's disease.
      Several clinical avenues have been explored, such as the usefulness of serologic 
      markers as screening tools for IBD and in accelerating a diagnosis in patients
      with indeterminate colitis. Another area of interest is disease stratification.
      Emerging data suggest there is a diversity of qualitative and quantitative
      responses to environmental antigens that differs among groups of IBD patients and
      may be associated with different clinical behaviors. As a result, it may be
      possible to tailor therapy on the basis of serologic responses. Prospective
      studies are needed before translating this concept into clinical practice.
      Clustering of IBD patients into more homogeneous subgroups based on antibody
      responses may help to unravel the pathophysiology of subsets of IBD.

TI  - Pediatric Crohn's disease and growth retardation: the role of genotype,
      phenotype, and disease severity.
PG  - 1281-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Delayed growth is a well-established feature of pediatric Crohn's
      disease. Several factors have been shown to affect growth, including disease
      location, severity, and treatment. The recently discovered NOD2 gene has been
      correlated to ileal location of Crohn's disease and subsequently could affect
      growth through the resulting phenotype or as an independent risk factor. The aim 
      of our study was to determine if growth retardation is affected by genotype
      independently of disease location or severity. METHODS: Genotyping for 3 NOD2
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms was performed in 93 patients with detailed growth
      records. Parameters including disease location, disease severity, and NOD 2
      genotype and their effect on z scores for height and weight at disease onset and 
      during follow-up were analyzed. RESULTS: NOD2 mutations were correlated with
      ileal location but not with disease severity or growth retardation. Ileal
      involvement was significantly associated with height retardation at disease onset
      and the lowest z score during follow-up. Use of steroids affected weight but not 
      height. Regression models for growth variables revealed that the strongest
      association with impaired growth is with disease severity (weight- and
      height-failure odds ratios: 6.17 and 4.52, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Severity
      of disease is correlated with growth failure for both height and weight. Location
      of disease is a weaker predictor of disordered growth and is correlated with
      growth retardation but not growth failure. The NOD2 genotype was not correlated
      with growth retardation or growth failure.

TI  - Management of the short bowel syndrome after extensive small bowel resection.
PG  - 977-92
AB  - Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is a global malabsorption syndrome that results from
      extensive intestinal resections. It used to be a typical complication of
      repetitive bowel resections in patients with Crohn's disease. However, due to
      improved medical and surgical therapies for these patients it currently occurs
      more frequently as a consequence of vascular disorders in adults (intestinal
      infarction) and congenital aberrations in children, respectively. Adequate
      therapy depends on the degree of (small) bowel losses and on resulting functional
      disturbances. Moreover, it must be adjusted to the postoperative adaptation
      process, which consists of three phases: The immediate acute phase lasts less
      than 4 weeks and serves to stabilise the patient. The subsequent year should be
      used to induce maximal adaptation by gradually increasing nutrient exposure. When
      maximal stimulation of nutrient absorption has been achieved, permanent
      maintenance nutrition treatment should be defined individually, dependent on
      extent and quality of nutritive deficits. In patients with Crohn's disease,
      optimal treatment of the underlying disease is of pivotal importance in order to 
      avoid a further reduction of absorptive capacity or other complications. Current 
      investigations aim at improving the adaptation process by administration of
      specific diets and growth hormones. With these, it appears possible to treat even
      some patients with very short bowel, i.e. less than 50 cm of small intestine
      left, with oral nutrition, only. Still, a considerable proportion of patients
      will need long-term parenteral nutrition. If young patients experience
      intolerable complications of parenteral nutrition, intestinal transplantation may
      be considered as a high risk therapy of last choice.

TI  - Postoperative leakage and abscess formation after colorectal surgery.
PG  - 865-80
AB  - Anastomotic leaks following colorectal surgery may be divided into those which
      are clinically significant and those which are not. Leakage occurs in 3.4-6% of
      all colorectal cases. It is most commonly associated with rectal anastomoses,
      being clinically significant in 2.9-15.3% of cases. Mortality following a leak
      may be 6.0-39.3%. There is no evidence that preoperative bowel preparation
      reduces the rate and consequences of leaks. There is no evidence for the use of
      drains when an anastomosis has been made outside the pelvis, but pelvic drainage 
      may be important after anterior resection. The use of covering stomas has not
      been shown to reduce leak rate but does mitigate the clinical effects of leaks.
      Prompt diagnosis and further laparotomy can reduce mortality following leakage.
      Intra-abdominal abscesses can in most cases be treated by radiologically guided
      drainage. Anastomotic leaks are the most common cause of anastomotic strictures
      and are also associated with increased rates of local recurrence of cancer.

TI  - Management of bleeding and leakage after pancreatic surgery.
PG  - 847-64
AB  - Pancreatic surgery has advanced considerably during the past decades. Recent
      studies report reduced morbidity rates and virtually no mortality after
      resection. However, postoperative complications are still a formidable menace. In
      this chapter we discuss the management of postoperative bleeding and leakages
      which are considered the most feared complications, and discuss the advent of
      minimal invasive methods for management of these complications. Patients who
      develop postoperative bleeding almost always present with septic complications
      and a sentinel bleed before onset of bleeding. These patients should undergo
      early diagnostic angiography followed by embolisation. If this does control the
      bleeding an emergency laparotomy should be performed as last resort. Patients who
      develop pancreatic leakage are generally managed conservatively by means of
      percutaneous drainage. Aggressive surgery should be performed at the first sign
      of severe sepsis. The condition of the pancreatic remant found during reoperation
      dictates the type of surgical intervention best performed.

TI  - Pediatric jejunoileitis: a severe Crohn's disease phenotype that requires
      intensive nutritional management.
PG  - 357-60
AB  - BACKGROUND: Jejunoileitis (JI) is an unusual manifestation of Crohn's disease
      (CD) that has been associated with high morbidity and the frequent need for
      surgical intervention. Although the disease has been well-described in adults,
      the true prevalence and clinical phenotype in children is unknown. AIM: To
      compare the clinical course and nutritional impact of CD in children with and
      without proximal small bowel involvement. METHODS: Patients with either Crohn's
      jejunitis or JI with or without colonic involvement were identified through a
      clinical database (1996--2002). All radiologic studies were reviewed by an
      experienced radiologist blinded to the clinical diagnosis. Thirty-six patients
      with CD without histologic or radiologic signs of proximal small bowel
      involvement were used for comparison. All medical, surgical, and hematologic
      parameters were compared in both disease groups. RESULTS: Among the 134 patients 
      with CD, 23 (17%) had radiologic signs of JI, including intestinal fold
      thickening (57%), luminal narrowing (31%), and skip lesions (13%). Enteric
      fistula (6%) and strictures (6%) were less common. Patients with JI were likely
      to be stunted at the time of diagnosis, require surgical intervention (P < 0.03) 
      and nutritional therapy in the form of nasogastric tube feeds (P < 0.03).
      Nutritional therapy was also associated with an improvement in height in patients
      with proximal small bowel disease (OR:5.87). DISCUSSION: JI is a relatively
      common disease phenotype in children with CD that requires aggressive nutritional
      and surgical intervention. Future studies are required to determine if the early 
      detection and use of immune modulators may lessen the morbidity associated with
      proximal small bowel disease.

TI  - Patterns of complementary and alternative medicine use in a population of
      pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 599-605
AB  - Complementary and alternative medicine use is prominent in the United States. The
      use of complementary and alternative therapies appears to be common in patients
      with inflammatory bowel disease, but few studies have been completed in children.
      We sought to examine the extent that children with inflammatory bowel disease in 
      the Greater Philadelphia area (Philadelphia County and the surrounding counties
      in Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania) use alternative therapies. We paid
      particular attention to the specific types of therapies used and whether certain 
      demographic and disease associated factors influence the degree of usage. In this
      study, we questioned the families of all children diagnosed with inflammatory
      bowel disease, aged 6 to 16 years and living within Philadelphia and its
      surrounding counties, who were followed at 1 of the 2 academic pediatric
      gastroenterology programs that served the area. More than 80% of surveys were
      returned. Fifty-one percent (95% C.I. 45% to 56%) of patients surveyed reported
      some form of alternative medicine use within the previous year. Univariate
      analysis revealed increased use among patients who had Crohn disease, who used
      the Internet for research on their disease, who reported poor quality of life and
      had increased school absences in the past year. Therapies associated with
      alternative medicine use included biological and immunomodulatory therapy.
      Regression analysis revealed positive associations between use of alternative
      therapies and expenditure on nonprescription treatments, poor quality of life,
      Internet research, and the need for calorie supplementation, whereas there was a 
      negative association with history of prior surgery for inflammatory bowel
      disease.

TI  - Intestinal interleukin-13 in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease patients.
PG  - 593-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a multifunctional cytokine whose net
      principle action is to diminish inflammatory responses. Dysregulation of IL-13
      production has been proposed to contribute to intestinal inflammation in
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Previous studies implicate IL-13 in
      IBD pathogenesis; however, they fail to accurately reflect in vivo intestinal
      IL-13 production. We evaluate IL-13, IL-6, and IL-1beta elaborations from colonic
      organ cultures of pediatric IBD patients METHODS: Endoscopic lamina propria
      biopsies or surgical specimens from pediatric patients with IBD were organ
      cultured and supernatants evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for
      IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-13. RESULTS: IL-13 concentrations were significantly
      reduced in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients when compared with normal controls (P
      = 0.002) and Crohn disease (CD) patients (P = 0.001). End-stage UC patients at
      colectomy had lower intestinal IL-13 production than all other UC patients (P =
      0.002). No significant correlation was found between IL-13 concentration and
      histologic disease severity (P = 0.134). CONCLUSIONS: Diminished intestinal IL-13
      production is present in UC patients and wanes further with clinical disease
      progression. These findings suggest that UC patients may be differentiated from
      CD patients by intestinal IL-13 quantitation, and UC patients may benefit from
      IL-13 enhancing therapies.

TI  - Characterization and distribution of colonic dendritic cells in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 504-12
AB  - Dendritic cells (DCs) are thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis
      of autoimmune inflammation, including Crohn's disease (CD). We investigated the
      distribution and state of maturation of DCs in the colon in relation to the
      severity of inflammation and therapy. Using archival specimens from colonic
      resections in 19 pediatric patients with CD and 14 controls, we identified and
      characterized the DCs within the lamina propria, submucosa, and muscularis
      compartments using morphologic and quantitative immunohistochemical methods. The 
      distribution of CD11c+CD83+CD68+DC-SIGN+ and immature CD11c+CD83-CD68-DC-SIGN+
      DCs within the different compartments varied according to the presence or absence
      of CD as well as to the severity of inflammation and systemic corticoid
      treatment. Immature DCs were only found in non-inflamed control colonic tissue.
      Marked reductions (60% and 30%) in total CD11c and CD83 DC numbers were observed 
      in CD tissue samples compared with controls (P < 0.05). CD samples from patients 
      on corticosteroid therapy were significantly more depleted than in tissue from
      untreated patients or those on other drugs. Colonic tissue with severe
      inflammation had reduced numbers of CD11c+ and CD83+ DCs in the lamina propria
      and submucosal compartments (80% and 76% for CD11c; 75% and 76% for CD83,
      respectively, P < 0.05), with a concomitant increase (525% for CD11c and 700% for
      CD83 P < 0.05) of DCs in the muscularis compartment, compared to moderately
      inflamed and non-inflamed CD tissue. Our data suggest that an imbalance in
      intestinal DC subpopulations may play a role in the initiation and/or the
      maintenance of chronic inflammation in CD. Corticosteroid therapy is associated
      with colonic DC depletion.

TI  - Assessment of the longitudinal changes in bone mineral density in patients
      receiving home parenteral nutrition.
PG  - 289-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low bone mineral density (BMD) is commonly reported in patients
      receiving home parenteral nutrition (HPN), but it remains unclear whether or not 
      an accelerated bone loss occurs during HPN therapy. We evaluated the spinal, hip,
      and forearm bone mass density longitudinally in a cohort of 75 patients receiving
      HPN. METHODS: A total of 943 regional dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scans, 335
      spinal, 318 hip, and 290 forearm, obtained between 1995 and 2003 in 75 patients
      receiving HPN, were used for the analysis of the annual changes in BMD. The
      average (SD) number of scans per patients was 4.4 (2.9), and follow-up time was
      4.1 (1.9) years. Diagnoses were Crohn's disease (n = 35) and other conditions
      (non-Crohn's diseases; n = 40). Data were analyzed using a linear random
      coefficient model. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant overall decline
      over time in spinal, hip, and forearm BMD, corresponding roughly to a 1% annual
      loss (p < .005); however, the loss was not significantly larger than that of age 
      and sex-matched healthy subjects. In Crohn's disease patients, model estimates of
      spinal and hip BMD on the initiation of HPN therapy were significantly reduced
      compared with normal, whereas values were not significantly reduced in
      non-Crohn's disease patients. CONCLUSIONS: With the current protocols for HPN
      treatment, the annual decline in BMD is moderate and not significantly larger
      than in age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. A considerable part of the
      metabolic bone disease in these patients is related to the underlying disease for
      which the HPN was indicated.

TI  - Standards of medical treatment and nutrition in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 503-9
AB  - Crohn's disease is a condition of chronic inflammation potentially involving any 
      location of the alimentary tract from mouth to anus but with a propensity for the
      distal small bowel and proximal large bowel. Frequent complications include
      stricture and fistula. Numerous extra-intestinal manifestations may also be
      present. The aetiology of Crohn's disease is incompletely understood, and
      therapy, although generally effective in alleviating the symptoms, is not
      curative. Due to the heterogeneity of the disease a major need for the
      therapeutic approach is the ability to define subgroups with distinct
      characteristics. However, with regard to the heterogeneity of demographic,
      anatomic and disease behaviour characteristics, distillation of the numerous
      possible phenotypes in simple categories is a formidable task. In the present
      review the focus will be on clinically relevant situations providing therapeutic 
      algorithms according to international guidelines.

TI  - Glutamine metabolism in Crohn's disease: a stable isotope study.
PG  - 1167-75
AB  - AIMS: To determine whether chronic intestinal inflammation alters glutamine
      utilization, six 31 +/- 6 yr-old patients with Crohn's disease and an age-matched
      group of 6 healthy subjects received 7-h intravenous infusions of
      L-[5,5,5-2H3]leucine, along with an infusion of L-[1-13C]glutamine delivered
      intravenously for the first 3.5 h, and via a nasogastric tube for the subsequent 
      3.5 hrs. None of the patients was receiving any nutritional supplement or
      antiinflammatory drug. All were in remission (Crohn's disease activity index <
      150) and in a near-normal nutritional status. METHODS: We used plasma
      2H3-alpha-ketoisocaproate to determine leucine appearance rate (Ra), and plasma
      13C-glutamine and breath 13CO2 to determine glutamine Ra and oxidation,
      respectively. The fraction of enteral glutamine undergoing uptake in the
      splanchnic bed was determined from the difference in plasma 13C-glutamine
      enrichments between the intravenous and nasogastric 13C-glutamine infusion
      periods. RESULTS: Neither leucine Ra, nor plasma glutamine concentration (526 +/-
      40 vs. 530 +/- 50 micromol/l), glutamine Ra (364 +/- 19 vs. 355 +/- 24 micromol
      kg(-1) h(-1)), or splanchnic glutamine uptake (61 +/- 5 vs. 65 +/- 2%) differed
      between groups. In both groups, glutamine oxidation rose when the glutamine
      tracer was supplied enterally, compared with the intravenous route (70 +/- 6 vs. 
      39 +/- 2% in patients; 69 +/- 2 vs. 38 +/- 1% in controls), but did not differ
      between groups. CONCLUSION: When in remission, patients with Crohn's disease have
      normal rates of proteolysis, and glutamine production, utilization, oxidation,
      and splanchnic uptake. The data suggest there is no obvious requirement for
      glutamine in patients with quiescent Crohn's disease.

TI  - Inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver associated with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 818-22
AB  - Inflammatory pseudotumor (IPT) of the liver is a rare, benign lesion that is
      characterized by proliferating fibrous tissue infiltrated by inflammatory cells. 
      The exact etiology of IPT remains unclear. Although the association of IPT with
      systemic inflammatory disorders has been established, a specific link with
      Crohn's disease is rare. We report two cases of IPT associated with Crohn's
      disease. Both patients were elderly males who presented with abdominal pain and
      jaundice. At the time of presentation, both had active Crohn's disease that was
      undiagnosed. Computed tomography demonstrated a liver mass, and endoscopic
      retrograde cholangiography revealed biliary strictures in both patients. Given
      their symptomatic jaundice and concern for cholangiocarcinoma, they underwent
      abdominal surgical exploration and pathology results revealed IPT. They were
      subsequently diagnosed with Crohn's disease. Following treatment of Crohn's
      disease, there was significant improvement in their overall clinical status. An
      underlying diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease should be considered in
      patients with IPT.

TI  - Controversies with aminosalicylates in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 104-17
AB  - Aminosalicylates have been shown to exhibit a wide range of anti-inflammatory and
      immunomodulatory properties. Since the discovery of sulfasalazine's efficacy in
      ulcerative colitis and the subsequent development of sulfa-free mesalamine
      delivery systems, aminosalicylates have evolved to become an integral part of our
      therapeutic armamentarium and are now first-line therapies for the treatment of
      mildly to moderately active inflammatory bowel disease and for maintenance of
      remissions after successful induction therapy. Despite the substantial body of
      evidence supporting the use of aminosalicylates in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
      disease, gaps in our evidence base and controversies surrounding aminosalicylates
      clinical application have emerged. In this review, issues of dose response and
      optimization of the treatment regimen in ulcerative colitis, the discrimination
      between oral mesalamine formulations in left-sided colitis, and their efficacy in
      active and quiescent Crohn's disease are discussed.

TI  - Review article: the role of nutrition in the treatment of inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 79-83
AB  - Nutrients may be involved in the modulation of the immune response through at
      least three different mechanisms. First, the intestinal ecosystem plays a pivotal
      role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, triggering the
      uncontrolled inflammatory response in genetically predisposed individuals.
      Nutrients, together with bacteria, are major components of, and can therefore
      influence, the intestinal environment. Second, as components of cell membranes,
      nutrients can mediate the expression of proteins involved in the immune response,
      such as cytokines, adhesion molecules and nitric oxide synthase. The composition 
      of lipids in the cell membrane is modified by dietary changes and can influence
      cellular responses. Indeed, various epidemiological, experimental and clinical
      data suggest that the immune response may be sensitive to changes in dietary
      composition. Finally, suboptimal levels of micronutrients are often found in both
      children and adults with inflammatory bowel disease, although, with the exception
      of iron and folate, it is unusual to discover symptoms attributable to these
      deficits. However, subclinical deficits may have a pathophysiological
      significance, as they may favour the self-perpetuation of the disease (due to
      defects in the mechanisms of tissue repair), cause defective defence against
      damage produced by oxygen free radicals and facilitate lipid peroxidation. These 
      events can occur even in clinically inactive or mildly active disease, as well as
      in the development of dysplasia in the intestinal mucosa. Some dietary
      manipulations have been attempted as primary treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, 
      and specially formulated diets for enteral nutrition have proved to be an
      effective treatment for Crohn's disease. Most trials, although lacking sufficient
      patient numbers, have demonstrated a role for dietary manipulation as primary
      therapy for inflammatory disease. Dietary lipids are one of the most active
      nutritional substrates modulating the immune response. Recently, it has been
      demonstrated that lipids may be a key factor explaining the therapeutic effect of
      clinical nutrition in Crohn's disease.

TI  - Review article: skin complications associated with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 50-3
AB  - Cutaneous manifestations are well-recognized complications of Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis. The incidence of these manifestations varies widely but, at
      the time of diagnosis, the mean incidence is around 10%. During the course of the
      disease, a great variety of skin lesions may develop, many of which are secondary
      to granulomatous cutaneous disease, reactive skin eruptions, nutritional
      deficiency and other associated conditions. The disorders that are directly
      related to the inflammatory process of Crohn's disease include perianal and
      peristomal ulcers and fistulae, metastatic Crohn's disease and oral granulomatous
      lesions. Histologically, the features are similar to those found in the inflamed 
      bowel. These lesions usually respond to treatment of the underlying intestinal
      disease. The most common forms of reactive skin eruption are erythema nodosum and
      pyoderma gangrenosum. Certain subsets of patients are more susceptible to the
      development of erythema nodosum; in a previous report from our group, erythema
      nodosum was seen mainly in females, and in patients with colonic involvement
      and/or arthritis. This manifestation tends to occur during the first 2 years of
      the clinical course of the disease and may recur in approximately one-half of
      cases. Infliximab is highly effective in healing refractory lesions of erythema
      nodosum and pyoderma gangrenosum. Manifestations that are secondary to
      nutritional deficiency or associated conditions include acrodermatitis
      enteropathica, psoriasis and autoimmune disorders. For most of the cutaneous
      manifestations, the primary therapeutic target remains the bowel. Early
      aggressive therapy can minimize severe complications and maintenance treatment
      may prevent some devastating consequences.

      with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 2767-8
AB  - We presented a 20-year-old patient with Crohn's disease (CD). Colonoscopy
      revealed longitudinal ulceration in the terminal ileum and rectal aphtoid ulcers.
      After treatment with mesalamine and total parenteral nutrition, repeat
      colonoscopy revealed a granular elevated area in the terminal ileum, which
      appeared as an irregular dome-like elevation with irregularly arranged villi on
      magnifying endoscopy. Biopsy specimens taken from the region showed
      microgranulomas and lymphoid hyperplasia. Scanning electron microscopy revealed
      the presence of M cells, confirming that the area corresponded to Peyer's
      patches. Peyer's patches by magnifying endoscopy and electron microscopy may
      provide insights into the pathogenesis of CD.

TI  - Peripheral blood mononuclear cell fatty acid composition and inflammatory
      mediator production in adult Crohn's disease.
PG  - 647-55
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with nutritional
      deficiencies, altered plasma concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)
      and an anti-inflammatory response to fish oil that contains n-3 PUFA. This
      suggests that, in CD, immune cells may have altered n-3 PUFA composition with
      functional consequences. The aim of this study is to investigate n-3 and n-6 PUFA
      composition and synthetic function of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
      in the basal state. METHODS: A case control study of 52 adult CD patients and
      healthy, age- and sex-matched controls. Composition of PBMC and plasma
      phospholipids were measured by gas chromatography and production of tumour
      necrosis factor-alpha, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)
      by PBMC were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: CD was associated with higher
      concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid and other n-3 PUFA, and lower arachidonic
      acid (AA) (n-6 PUFA) in PBMC. This was not explained by differences in dietary
      fat intake. Lower rates of production of PGE2 and IFN-gamma by PBMC were noted in
      quiescent and active CD, respectively, compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: CD is
      associated with a greater availability, and not a deficiency, of n-3 PUFA in
      PBMC, but lower concentrations of AA, and lower rates of production of PGE2 and
      IFN-gamma, compared to healthy controls.

TI  - Comparison of serological markers of inflammatory bowel disease with clinical
      diagnosis in children.
PG  - 240-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our purpose was to study the concordance of serological tests for
      inflammatory bowel disease with clinical diagnosis established by traditional
      testing in children. METHODS: All children seen in our division who had IBD
      Diagnostic System (ie, pANCA, ASCA IgA, and ASCA IgG) performed over a 21-month
      period (June 1998 to February 2000) were identified. Their medical records were
      reviewed for basic demographics, test results (endoscopy, histology, and
      radiology), IBD Diagnostic System results, and patient symptoms/medications.
      Results of the IBD Diagnostic System were compared with several patient
      characteristics including age, sex, absence/presence of symptoms, medication use,
      disease activity and duration. RESULTS: One hundred seven patients were divided
      into 6 groups based on clinical diagnosis and IBD Diagnostic System results. The 
      sensitivity, specificity and +/- predictive values of the IBD Diagnostic System
      for ulcerative colitis were 69.2, 95.1, 90.0, and 87.1%, respectively, and for
      Crohn's disease were 54.1, 96.8, 90.9, and 80.8%, respectively. Overall, the
      results of the IBD Diagnostic System were concordant with the clinical diagnosis 
      in 76 of the 107 (71%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, the specificity 
      of IBD Diagnostic System is better than the sensitivity; the sensitivity is
      better for ulcerative colitis than Crohn's disease (69.2% vs 54.1%). The low
      sensitivity, especially for Crohn's disease, precludes the possibility that the
      IBD Diagnostic System can replace traditional studies when evaluating for
      inflammatory bowel disease. Though we do not exclude inflammatory bowel disease
      solely by IBD Diagnostic System results, it is reassuring to note that all
      patients without clinical evidence of inflammatory bowel disease also had
      negative IBD Diagnostic System results.

TI  - Chronic granulomatous disease caused by a deficiency in p47(phox) mimicking
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 690-5
AB  - We describe 2 cases of autosomal recessive chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) in
      2 sisters presenting with a picture consistent with inflammatory bowel disease.
      The index case is a 10-year-old girl with a history of refractory Crohn's colitis
      treated with aggressive immunosuppressive therapy whose course subsequently was
      complicated by central nervous system aspergillosis. Additional evaluation showed
      a diagnosis of CGD, an underlying immunodeficiency in which phagocytes fail to
      produce microbicidal reactive oxygen intermediates because of inherited defects
      in the reduced form of nicotinamide-adenine phosphate dinucleotide (NADPH)
      oxidase. The diagnosis of a typically X-linked inherited disease in our female
      patient suggested that she had 1 of the 3 less common autosomal recessive forms
      of the disease. This was confirmed by studies showing the absence of the
      p47(phox) subunit of NADPH oxidase in her neutrophils and the presence of a
      homozygous dinucleotide deletion in the neutrophil cytosolic factor 1 gene that
      encodes p47(phox). Additional analyses of members of the patient's immediate
      family showed the same homozygous mutation in 2 siblings, 1 of whom also
      developed chronic colitis consistent with a diagnosis of Crohn's disease. These 2
      cases emphasize the importance of high clinical suspicion for an alternative
      diagnosis of immune deficiency in the setting of presumed inflammatory bowel
      disease and opportunistic infection.

TI  - NOD2/CARD15 mutation analysis and genotype-phenotype correlation in Jewish
      pediatric patients compared with adults with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 208-12
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The allelic variants in the NOD2/CARD15 gene G908R, R702W, and 1007fs
      are strongly and independently associated with susceptibility to Crohn's disease 
      (CD). Our aim was to compare the NOD2/CARD15 genotype and the genotype-phenotype 
      correlation in Jewish pediatric patients with CD (</=16 years of age) with older 
      patients with CD. STUDY DESIGN: Carrier frequencies of the three variants were
      determined in 67 children and 144 adults with CD. Variants were detected by using
      allele-specific polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme digestion assay.
      Demographic and phenotypic characterizations of the patients were determined.
      RESULTS: The carrier rate of the three NOD2/CARD15-associated variants was 51.5% 
      in children and 37.5% in adults (P=.07). The most prevalent allele variant was
      G908R (allele frequency 18% in children, 11% in adults; P=.063). Young Ashkenazi 
      patients had the highest allele frequency of G908R, and higher than Ashkenazi
      adults: 25% and 9%, respectively (P=.003). Children had more family history of
      inflammatory bowel disease and more inflammatory-type disease, with no relation
      to variant allele carriage. CONCLUSIONS: G908R allele-variant of the NOD2/CARD15 
      gene is closely related with the appearance of CD at a young age in Jewish
      Ashkenazi patients.

TI  - Efficacy of nutritional therapy for perforating and non-perforating Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 1050-2
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Enteral nutrition is the currently established primary therapy
      for Crohn's disease in Japan. We examined the effects of postoperative
      nutritional therapy in patients with perforating type and non-perforating type
      Crohn's disease. METHODOLOGY: We retrospectively reviewed the records for 218
      patients who underwent surgical interventions for Crohn's disease in our hospital
      between January 1, 1974 and September 30, 2001. They were divided into four
      groups: 92 patients in the non-perforating type (NP type) + Elemental Diet (ED)
      group had received ED therapy and nutritional education, 22 patients in the NP
      type + NoED group had not received ED therapy or nutritional education, 88
      patients in the perforating type (P type) + ED group and 16 patients in P type + 
      NoED group. We evaluated the incidence of reoperation rate for each group.
      RESULTS: Patients with a postoperative ED therapy demonstrated a significant
      decrease in the incidence of second resection. The incidence of second resection 
      in the NP type + ED group was significantly lower than that of the other groups. 
      The NP type + NoED group and the P type + ED group followed similar courses.
      CONCLUSIONS: In patients with Crohn's disease postoperative ED therapy and
      nutritional education is effective in reducing the incidence of second resection.
      It appears that postoperative ED therapy and nutritional education is more
      important in patients with P type Crohn's disease.

TI  - [Low bone mineral density in children with Crohn's disease].
PG  - 800-6
AB  - UNLABELLED: Recent studies have reported low bone mineral density in children
      with Crohn's disease. The aims of this retrospective study were to quantify its
      frequency and to search for risk factors. POPULATION AND METHODS: Bone mineral
      density of 29 children with Crohn's disease was measured by dual-energy X-ray
      absorptiometry. All the children were taking calcium and vitamin D, during all
      the follow-up. RESULTS: Osteoporosis (Z-score < or = -2.5 S.D.) was found in 38% 
      of the children, and osteopenia in 38% (Z-score between -1 and -2.5 S.D.). Low
      bone mineral density was correlated with age, suggesting it begins with puberty. 
      Daily corticosteroid exposure was significantly higher for patients with
      osteoporosis. Disease severity measured with Harvey-Bradshaw index and exposure
      to immunosuppressive drugs were almost statistically significant. Sex, height,
      duration and site of disease, nutritional assistance exposure were not associated
      with low bone mineral density. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the high frequency
      of low bone mineral density in children with Crohn's disease, mainly during
      puberty. Corticosteroid exposure is a risk factor, and the disease severity, a
      probable one (non significant). New treatment strategy has to be defined to
      prevent and to treat this complication.

TI  - Improvement in quality of life of children with acute Crohn's disease does not
      parallel mucosal healing after treatment with exclusive enteral nutrition.
PG  - 167-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is a chronic debilitating disorder affecting a
      child's physical and emotional well-being. Recent emphasis on 'quality of life'
      (QOL) has led to re-evaluation of available medical treatments. AIM: To assess
      prospectively change in QOL, clinical disease activity and intestinal mucosal
      inflammation in active paediatric Crohn's disease after treatment with exclusive 
      enteral nutrition. In addition, we evaluated whether change in QOL could predict 
      changes in paediatric Crohn's disease activity index (PCDAI) and mucosal
      inflammation (endoscopic and histologic). METHODS: The IMPACT II questionnaire
      was used prospectively and longitudinally in 26 consecutively recruited children 
      [16 males (67%), median 14 years, s.d. = 1.7 years] with active Crohn's disease
      (PCDAI > 20). They were treated with a new polymeric enteral feed (ACD004,
      Nestle) for a period of 8 weeks. All had PCDAI, QOL and endoscopic assessment at 
      the time of diagnosis and after 8 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: Twenty-three of 26
      children achieved a clinical remission at 8 weeks, with improvement in the QOL
      scores (P < 0.05). The change in QOL score after treatment was predictive of
      achieving a clinical remission, but not of histological improvement. CONCLUSIONS:
      Although children may find dietary restrictions difficult, this study confirms a 
      clear improvement in QOL after treatment with exclusive enteral nutrition.
      However, improvement in QOL scores is not reflected by improvement in mucosal
      inflammation. Whilst improving QOL remains a core principal in patient
      management, the long-term consequences of ongoing mucosal inflammation must be
      better understood before relying only on short-term QOL measures to dictate
      treatment choices.

TI  - Incidence and importance of antibody responses to infliximab after maintenance or
      episodic treatment in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 542-53
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The effect of different treatment regimens on antibody
      responses to infliximab and their clinical significance was examined by using
      data from ACCENT I. METHODS: Patients with Crohn's disease (n = 573) received 5
      mg/kg infliximab (week 0) and then were randomly assigned to blinded infusions at
      weeks 2 and 6 and every 8 weeks until week 46 of placebo (group I), 5 mg/kg
      infliximab (group II), or 5 mg/kg infliximab at weeks 2 and 6, followed by 10
      mg/kg thereafter (group III). At week 14 or later, patients losing response could
      cross over to episodic infliximab treatment increased by 5 mg/kg. Samples for
      antibody determination were collected before the first infusion and at weeks 14, 
      22, 54, 62, 72, and, if applicable, before and after crossover. RESULTS: Through 
      week 72, antibodies to infliximab were detected in 30%, 10%, and 7% of groups I, 
      II, and III, respectively (P < 0.0001). Patients receiving immunomodulators had a
      lower incidence of antibodies compared with patients receiving infliximab alone
      (10% and 18%, respectively; P = 0.02). Antibodies were associated with a 12%
      absolute increase in infusion reactions but no increase in serious infusion
      reactions or serum sickness-like reactions. In the overall population, similar
      proportions of antibody-positive and antibody-negative patients achieved clinical
      response (64% and 62%, respectively; P = NS) or clinical remission (41% and 39%, 
      respectively; P = NS) at week 54. Notably, 86% of patients responded to
      retreatment, and 63% were in clinical response at week 54; however, fewer
      antibody-positive group I patients attained clinical remission (31%) compared
      with those who were antibody negative (37%) or antibody inconclusive (54%) (P =
      NS). CONCLUSIONS: Reduced antibody formation and greater clinical benefit were
      observed with an induction regimen followed by maintenance treatment compared
      with a single dose followed by episodic retreatment in Crohn's disease patients
      treated with infliximab.

TI  - Zinc metabolism in adolescents with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 235-9
AB  - Low serum zinc concentrations have been reported in Crohn's disease (CD) and
      overt zinc deficiency has been described, but little is known about the effect of
      CD on zinc metabolism in adolescents. The aim of this study was to measure zinc
      absorption, endogenous fecal zinc excretion, urinary zinc excretion, and zinc
      balance in children with stable CD and in matched controls. Subjects were 15
      children, ages 8-18 y, with stable CD, and 15 healthy matched controls. Subjects 
      were adapted to diets providing 12 mg/d elemental zinc for 2 wk, and then
      admitted for a 6-d metabolic study. Stable zinc isotopes were given intravenously
      and orally, and urine and feces collected for 6 d. Fractional zinc absorption,
      endogenous fecal zinc excretion, and zinc balance were calculated using
      established stable isotope methods. In subjects with CD, zinc absorption (10.9%
      +/- 6.1 versus 23.4 +/- 15.8, p = 0.008) and plasma zinc concentration (0.85
      mg/dL +/- 0.15 versus 1.25 +/- 0.35, p = 0.004) were significantly reduced,
      compared with controls. Despite this, there were no significant differences in
      endogenous fecal zinc excretion (2.0 mg +/- 1.5 versus 1.5 +/- 1.5, p = 0.34) or 
      urinary zinc excretion (0.9 mg +/- 0.7 versus 1.0 +/- 0.7, p = 0.47). Zinc
      balance was significantly lower in CD (-1.5 mg +/- 1.5) than in controls (+0.6 mg
      +/- 3.1, p < 0.0001). In conclusion, adolescents with CD have significantly
      reduced zinc absorption. Despite this, they were unable to reduce endogenous
      fecal zinc excretion to restore normal zinc balance and had a significantly worse
      zinc balance and lower plasma zinc concentration than controls.

TI  - Mesalamine derivatives in the treatment of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 303-17, ix-x
AB  - The role of the aminosalicylates for induction therapy of mild moderate
      ulcerative colitis and as maintenance treatment has been substantiated by a large
      series of controlled clinical trials and confirmatory meta-analyses. Both
      sulfasalazine and newer derivatives are effective in preventing relapses. It
      remains to be determined whether certain high-risk groups of patients may benefit
      from higher doses of mesalamine induction or maintenance therapy. Mesalamine
      derivatives are also of benefit in the treatment of Crohn's disease.
      Sulfasalazine is likely not effective in the maintenance of Crohn's disease,
      although other mesalamine formulations continue to show some prophylactic
      activity after mesalamine induced remissions and for patients with disease of the
      ileum who have undergone surgical resection.

TI  - Tobacco and IBD: relevance in the understanding of disease mechanisms and
      clinical practice.
PG  - 481-96
AB  - Current smoking protects against ulcerative colitis and, after onset of the
      disease, improves its course, decreasing the need for colectomy. However, smoking
      increases the risk of developing Crohn's disease and worsens its course,
      increasing the need for steroids, immunosuppressants and reoperations. Smoking
      cessation aggravates ulcerative colitis and improves Crohn's disease. The effects
      of smoking are the sum of contradictory effects of various substances, including 
      nicotine and carbon monoxide, and are modulated by gender, genetic background,
      disease location and activity, cigarette dose and nicotine concentration. Smokers
      with ulcerative colitis should not be discouraged from stopping smoking but
      encouraged to stop, to reduce their risk of cardiopulmonary tobacco-related
      diseases. In Crohn's disease, smoking cessation has become a major therapeutic
      goal, particularly in young women and in patients with ileal involvement. A large
      amount of supportive information, use of nicotine-replacement therapies and
      antidepressants, and individual counselling might aid the patient in quitting.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease: a complex group of genetic disorders.
PG  - 451-62
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are complex genetic disorders resulting from the
      complex interplay between several genetic and environmental risk factors. The
      number of IBD genes is currently unknown but it is expected to be equal or higher
      to 8. None of these genes are expected to be neither necessary nor sufficient for
      disease development. Among the candidate genes investigated to date, only
      CARD15/NOD2 has been definitively associated with Crohn Disease (CD) but not
      Ulcerative Colitis (UC). This gene explains about 20% of the genetic
      predisposition to CD. Because it is involved in the innate immunity, it allows to
      speculate that CD is the result of a defect in host-bacteria interaction.
      However, it is not known if CD is caused by specific bacteria or the gut flora as
      a whole.

TI  - Psoas abscess: a rare complication of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 187-90
AB  - UNLABELLED: Psoas abscess is a rare complication of Crohn's disease. METHODS AND 
      MATERIALS: We evaluated the incidence of psoas abscess on 312 patients with
      Crohn's disease, seen at our institution between 1992-2001. RESULTS: We
      encountered three cases of psoas abscess (0.9%). One patient was managed with
      ileocolic resection and immediate anastomosis, while in two patients a
      percutaneous drainage was first performed and then, after 12 days of total
      parenteral nutrition, a resection of the diseased bowel with immediate
      reconstruction was carried out. CONCLUSIONS: A correction of the nutritional
      deficiencies is mandatory. Percutaneous computed-tomography guided drainage of
      the abscess with intestinal resection with immediate anastomosis, performed after
      a parenteral hyperalimentation, should be the method of choice in the management 
      of such patients.

TI  - Laboratory markers predict bone loss in Crohn's disease: relationship to blood
      mononuclear cell function and nutritional status.
PG  - 1063-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is associated with reduced bone density. The power of
      simple markers of systemic inflammation to identify higher rates of bone loss, in
      Crohn's disease, is uncertain. This relationship and the role of circulating
      (peripheral blood) mononuclear cells were investigated in a case-control study.
      METHODS: Urinary deoxypyridinoline/creatinine and serum osteocalcin
      concentrations were compared in male and premenopausal females with "active"
      Crohn's disease (C-reactive protein > or = 10 and/or erythrocyte sedimentation
      rate > or = 20) (n = 22) and controls with "quiescent" Crohn's disease
      (C-reactive protein < 10 and erythrocyte sedimentation rate < 20) (n = 21). No
      patients were receiving corticosteroid therapy. Production of tumour necrosis
      factor-alpha, interferon-gamma and prostaglandin E(2) by peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells were measured. RESULTS: Active Crohn's disease was associated
      with a higher deoxypyridinoline/creatinine (P = 0.02) and
      deoxypyridinoline/creatinine:osteocalcin ratio (P =0.01) compared with quiescent 
      Crohn's disease, but similar osteocalcin (P = 0.24). These were not explained by 
      vitamin D status, dietary intake or nutritional status. However, production of
      interferon-gamma by concanavalin A-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
      was lower in active Crohn's disease (P = 0.02) and correlated negatively with the
      deoxypyridinoline/creatinine:osteocalcin ratio (r = -0.40, P = 0.004).
      CONCLUSION: In Crohn's disease, raised C-reactive protein and erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate may indicate higher rates of bone loss and, if persistent, the
      need to assess bone mass even where disease symptoms are mild. This may be partly
      explained by altered production of interferon-gamma by peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells.

TI  - Maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease: current and emerging therapeutic
      options.
PG  - 1069-89
AB  - Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disorder with a relapsing and
      remitting course. Once remission is achieved, the main aim of the management of
      Crohn's disease is maintenance of that remission. Significant advances have been 
      made into understanding the aetiology and pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel
      disease. With these advances in understanding come increasing numbers of new
      agents and therapies, aimed both at active disease and the subsequent maintenance
      of remission in Crohn's disease. Current therapeutic strategies in maintaining
      remission in Crohn's disease include 5-aminosalicylates (e.g. sulfasalazine,
      mesalazine), thiopurines (e.g. azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine [mercaptopurine]), 
      methotrexate and infliximab. The 5-aminosalicylates appear to have efficacy
      limited to either surgically induced remission and/or limited small bowel Crohn's
      disease. The immunomodulators now have an established role in Crohn's
      maintenance. Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine are effective in chronic active
      disease and corticosteroid-dependent Crohn's disease. Methotrexate has similar
      indications, although it appears to be an alternative in patients who are
      intolerant of, or resistant to, the thiopurines. The most recent breakthrough has
      been in the field of biological therapy for maintenance of remission in Crohn's
      disease. Treatment of patients with the anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha
      antibody infliximab has been shown already to be effective in inducing remission.
      Recent studies have now confirmed a role for infliximab in delaying relapse and
      maintaining remission in patients responsive to infliximab induction therapy.
      However, results with soluble TNF alpha receptors have been disappointing. A
      number of other biological and nonbiological agents have shown potential, though 
      trials of the 'newer' biological agents have thus far been disappointing, in the 
      maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. The evidence for theses agents is
      currently limited, in many cases to treating active disease; however, these data 
      are discussed in this article in order to provide an overview of future potential
      therapies. The aim of this review is to provide clinicians with an insight into
      current and emerging therapeutic agents for the maintenance of remission of
      Crohn's disease.

TI  - Crohn's disease: a two-year prospective study of the association between
      psychological distress and disease activity.
PG  - 492-7
AB  - Our objective was to explore the relationship between psychological distress and 
      subsequent Crohn's disease (CD) activity. Eighteen CD patients were followed
      prospectively for 2 years at 8- to 12-week intervals. Disease activity was
      assessed using the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI). Psychological distress 
      was assessed using the following self-administered questionnaires: Beck
      Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck Hopelessness Scale
      (BHS), and multiple Holmes Recent Life Changes (RLC) Questionnaires. The effects 
      of psychological distress on current and subsequent CDAI (approximately 8-12
      weeks later) were assessed using generalized estimating equations (GEE). The mean
      CDAI score during follow-up was 138 +/- 86, with a median of 121 (range, 0 to
      394). BDI scores (possible range of 0 to 63) were independently associated with
      CDAI scores simultaneously (beta = 5.64, P = 0.004) and 8-12 weeks later (beta = 
      6.08, P = 0.004). Higher levels of anxiety, hopelessness, and recent life changes
      were also suggestive of higher CDAI scores, however, their effects were generally
      of lesser magnitude and not independent of the influence of depressive symptoms. 
      Levels of depressive symptoms are positively associated with future changes in
      CDAI. Routine psychological assessment may help to identify patients at higher
      risk for exacerbation.

TI  - The metabolic activity of fecal microbiota from healthy individuals and patients 
      with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 485-91
AB  - The hypothesis was studied that intestinal microbial metabolites play a role in
      the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. For that purpose, an in vitro
      model of the colon was inoculated with fresh feces of six healthy individuals and
      eight inflammatory bowel disease patients. Samples were taken from the model over
      time to analyze metabolites from both saccharolytic and proteolytic fermentation.
      Microbiotas from inflammatory bowel disease patients produced significantly more 
      short-chain fatty acids and ammonia than microbiotas from healthy individuals.
      Furthermore, the branched-chain fatty acid production was 25% higher after
      inoculation with microbiotas from patients than after inoculation with
      microbiotas from healthy individuals. Phenolic compounds were produced by all
      microbiotas, with large interindividual variation. The production of (potentially
      toxic) metabolites may play a role in the onset or chronicity of inflammatory
      bowel disease, because they were produced in higher amounts by microbiotas from
      these patients than by microbiotas from healthy individuals.

      treatment. Ulcerative colitis and Crohns disease are chronic with remissions and 
      recidives. Crohns disease involves any part of digestive tube. Histological
      changes in ulcerative colitis are: inflammation of mucosa and submucosal tissue, 
      crypt abscesses and ulcerations, pseudopolpys, bowel shortening and toxic
      megacolon in severe inflammation. In Crohns disease, transmural inflammation,
      "jumping lesions", deeper ulcerations, coble-stone mucosa, progressive fibrosis, 
      granuloma with gigantic epithelial cells. TREATMENT: ulcerative colitis:
      mesalazine, rectal 5-ASA and hydrocortisone enemas, surgery. Crohns disease:
      mesalazine and prednisolone. For terminal ilcitis, corticosteroid budesonid could
      be applied. Severe symptomatic disease: hospitalization, parenteral nutrition,
      antibiotics, prednisone, surgery in partial bowel obstruction, fistulas,
      abscessus, perforation.

TI  - A novel approach to a patient with Crohn disease and a high stoma output: a
      missed opportunity?
PG  - 398-400
AB  - The development of stricturing or penetrating behaviour in Crohn disease is
      influenced by disease location, clinical activity of the disease and smoking
      habit. The management of inflammatory bowel disease remains unsatisfactory, and
      the influence of current therapies--immunosuppressants, and especially the novel 
      biological treatment now commonly used in Crohn disease--remains largely unknown.
      A relatively smaller number of patients receive dietary treatment as well.
      Physicians' scepticism, under-resourced dietetic departments and patient
      compliance are the main concerns in considering enteral nutrition. The management
      of high stomal output in Crohn disease is even more challenging. We report a case
      of active Crohn disease with high stoma output treated successfully solely with
      enteral feeding without the need for surgical intervention or administration of
      potent pharmacotherapy.

TI  - Elemental versus polymeric enteral nutrition in paediatric Crohn's disease: a
      multicentre randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 327-35
AB  - AIM: To compare the efficacy and safety of an elemental and a polymeric diet as
      the primary therapy for active Crohn's disease in children. METHODS: In a
      randomized, non-blind, multicentre, controlled trial in Sweden, 16 children with 
      Crohn's disease received Elemental 028 Extra (E028E) and 17 Nutrison Standard
      (NuS). Remission rates (Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) < 10 or
      a PCDAI decrease of 40% or 15 points of initial level) were compared at 6 wk.
      RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the two groups in remission 
      rate at 6 wk (intent-to-treat analysis): E028E 11/16 (69%) and NuS 14/17 (82%) (p
      = 0.438). There was no difference in the decrease in PCDAI and CDAI between
      patients treated with E028E and those treated with NuS from 0 to 6 wk. Patients
      treated with NuS gained significantly more weight than patients treated with
      E028E (+2.5 kg; 95% CI 0.9, 4.1; p = 0.004), this difference remained when
      adjusting for maximum caloric intake per kilogram bodyweight (+2.9 kg; 95% CI
      1.4, 4.5; p = 0.001). Concomitant disease, complications and side effects were
      seen in 5/33 patients (pyelonephritis, pneumonia, intraabdominal abscess,
      perianal abscess and borborygmi). CONCLUSION: E028E and NuS did not differ in
      terms of remission rate. Patients treated with NuS gained more weight than
      patients with E028E. Polymeric diet may be superior to elemental diet in the
      treatment of paediatric Crohn's disease where the primary aim is to increase the 
      patient's weight.

TI  - Do serological markers and cytokines determine the indeterminate?
PG  - S51-6
AB  - There is a general sense that indeterminate colitis (IC) runs an aggressive
      clinical course, is medically refractory, and is associated with higher pouch
      failure rates following restorative proctocolectomy. The question has been raised
      whether IC can be assigned to a diagnosis of Crohn's disease or ulcerative
      colitis through the characterization of immunogenetic similarities, or whether IC
      may represent a distinct subgroup within these heterogeneous disorders. In this
      article, the use of serologic markers, genetics, and immune responses to
      understand the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and define
      clinically important subgroups of patients will be discussed. Then, how these
      scientific advances have been applied to the entity of IC will be reviewed.
      Importantly, a recent prospective study suggests that the absence of
      IBD-associated serologic markers defines the majority of IC as a separate entity 
      within the spectrum of IBD. The development of serologic, genetic, and immune
      response markers will allow for rational description of clinically important
      subgroups, redefine natural history, and predict responses to therapy in IBD.

TI  - Italian guidelines for intestinal transplantation: potential candidates among the
      adult patients managed by a medical referral center for chronic intestinal
      failure.
PG  - 659-61
AB  - In 2002, the Italian guidelines for eligibility of patients for intestinal
      transplantation (ITx) were defined as: life-threatening complications of home
      parenteral nutrition (HPN), lack of venous access for HPN, locally invasive
      tumors of the abdomen, Chronic intestinal failure (CIF) with a high risk of
      mortality, primary disease-related poor quality of life (QoL) despite optimal
      HPN. Our aim was to identify potential candidates for ITx according to these
      national guidelines among patients managed by a medical referral center for CIF. 
      Records of patients who received HPN were reviewed. CIF was considered reversible
      or irreversible (energy by HPN <50% or >50% basal energy expenditure). Patients
      with irreversible CIF were considered eligible for ITx in the absence of a
      contraindication, as are used for solid organs Tx. From 1986 to 2003 among 64
      patients who met the entry criteria 23 showed reversible and 41 irreversible,
      CIF. Twenty-one patients with irreversible CIF had an indication for ITx, but
      eight had also contraindications; thus 13 were eligible, including intestinal
      pseudo-obstruction (n = 6), mesenteric ischemia (n = 3), Crohn's (n = 2),
      radiation enteritis (n = 1), and desmoid (n = 1). Indications for ITx included
      HPN liver failure (n = 2), lack of venous access (n = 2), CIF with high risk of
      mortality (n = 3), very poor QoL (n = 6 including 5 with pseudo-obstruction).
      According to the Italian guidelines for ITx, 31% of patients with irreversible
      CIF managed by a medical referral center were eligible for ITx. Primary
      disease-related poor QoL was the indication in half of them. Studies on the QoL
      after ITx are required to allow patients to make an educated decision.

TI  - Results of surgical removal of the pouch after failed restorative
      proctocolectomy.
PG  - 869-75
AB  - PURPOSE: Restorative proctocolectomy is the elective surgical procedure of choice
      for ulcerative colitis and familial adenomatous polyposis. Most patients have a
      satisfactory outcome, but at ten years 15 percent or more will have failed,
      needing indefinite defunctioning or excision of the pouch. There is little
      information on the morbidity of pouch excision. The study was designed to present
      the early results of surgical removal of the pouch after failed restorative
      proctocolectomy with reference to the indications and intermediate complications,
      particularly of the perineal wound. METHODS: Between 1977 and 2002, 996 patients 
      underwent a restorative proctocolectomy at our hospital and 245 patients were
      referred for potential salvage. The pouch was excised in 58 and 10 patients
      respectively. There were 40 females and 28 males (median age, 34 (14-65) years)
      including 47 with ulcerative colitis, 10 with Crohn's disease, and 11 with
      familial adenomatous polyposis. The median follow-up was 79 (range, 3-312) months
      from excision. RESULTS: There was one (1.4 percent) postoperative death. The
      overall morbidity rate was 62.3 percent (immediate 30 days (25 percent), late
      (53.7 percent)). Thirty-six patients (53.7 percent) were readmitted on 67
      occasions for a late complication. The risk of readmission from the time of pouch
      excision was 38 and 58 percent at one and five years, respectively. Surgical
      treatment was required during 48 of these readmissions. A persistent perineal
      sinus was the most common late complication. The perineal wound was not healed at
      6 months in 27 patients (40 percent) and at 12 months in 7 patients (10 percent).
      No factor, including age at the time of pouch excision, gender, indication for
      excision, or final histologic diagnosis, was associated with an unhealed perineal
      wound. Two males (7 percent) had impotence. One female suffered from short-bowel 
      syndrome with the need of permanent parenteral nutrition. The median overall
      hospital stay for all admissions was 20 (range, 8-220) days. CONCLUSIONS: Pouch
      excision is associated with high morbidity. Perineal wound-delayed healing is the
      commonest late complication and often requires further surgery.

TI  - Human antichimeric antibody in children and young adults with inflammatory bowel 
      disease receiving infliximab.
PG  - 502-8
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pediatric studies on immunogenicity of infliximab have not been
      published. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of human
      antichimeric antibody (HACA), relationship to infusion reactions (IR), and the
      role of concomitant immunomodulatory therapies. METHODS: An inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) database was queried, and a retrospective review of patients who
      had HACA performed was undertaken. RESULTS: HACA was conclusively determined in
      34 patients with IBD (14 male, Crohn disease/ulcerative colitis: 30/4), median
      age 14.8 years (range, 6.4-22.5 years). Twenty-nine (85.3%) patients were
      receiving immunomodulatory therapy. A total of 234 infliximab infusions were
      administered (mean, 6.9; range, 1-26). HACA was detected in 12 (35.3%) patients. 
      IR occurred in 8 (23.5%) patients. HACA-positive patients had a higher proportion
      of infusions associated with IR than did HACA-negative patients (P < 0.01). HACA 
      levels > or =8.0 microg/mL were more likely to be associated with IR (P = 0.03). 
      Levels of > or = 8.0 microg/mL were more common in patients who had an average
      interval between infliximab infusions of 8 weeks or less (P = 0.04). Concomitant 
      immunomodulatory therapy was associated with a lower risk of developing HACA (P =
      0.02) and lower titer of HACA (P = 0.04). Patients did not have HACA at a greater
      rate when there was an extended interval (more than 12 weeks) between infliximab 
      infusions (P = 0.89). CONCLUSIONS: In children and adolescents with IBD, HACA
      formation is related to IR and to the duration of response to treatment.
      Immunomodulatory agents seem to have a protective role against development of
      HACA or high titers of antibodies. The interval between infusions does not
      influence the development of HACA.

TI  - Budesonide versus prednisolone for the treatment of active Crohn's disease in
      children: a randomized, double-blind, controlled, multicentre trial.
PG  - 47-54
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Budesonide is a corticosteroid with low systemic bioavailability
      because of its high first-pass metabolism in the liver. In this paediatric,
      randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, controlled, multicentre trial, the safety
      and efficacy of budesonide versus prednisolone were evaluated in children with
      active Crohn's disease. METHODS: Forty-eight children, aged 6-16 years, with
      active Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index > 200) involving ileum
      and/or ascending colon were randomized to receive budesonide (9 mg/day for 8
      weeks, 6 mg/day for 4 weeks) or prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks, tapering
      for 8 weeks). RESULTS: The groups were comparable for age, sex, pubertal stage,
      disease activity and disease duration. Mean morning plasma cortisol concentration
      was significantly higher in the budesonide group (200 nmol/l) than in the
      prednisolone group (98 nmol/l) after 8 weeks, reflecting less adrenal suppression
      by budesonide (difference -102 nmol/l; 95% CI -226, -52; P = 0.0028).
      Glucocorticosteroid side effects such as moon face and acne occurred
      significantly less frequently in the budesonide group. Remission (Crohn's Disease
      Activity Index < or = 150) was seen at 8 weeks in 12/22 (55%) patients treated
      with budesonide and in 17/24 (71%) patients receiving prednisolone (difference
      -16%; 95% CI -45,13; P = 0.25). CONCLUSIONS: Significantly fewer side effects and
      less adrenal suppression were observed in the children receiving budesonide.
      Remission rates were not significantly different in the two groups. However,
      there was a trend for prednisolone to be more effective for inducing remission.

AB  - Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease result from an interaction between genetic
      and environmental factors. Only one gene, NOD2/CARD15, has been clearly
      identified; a minority of people with alteration of this gene develop Crohn's
      disease. The NOD2/CARD15 protein is thought to be involved in defence against
      intracellular bacteria. This supports the idea that Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis result from altered immunological responses to the normal
      intestinal flora. Life expectancy is normal in ulcerative colitis and nearly so
      in Crohn's disease, but both conditions cause considerable morbidity.
      Approximately 80% of patients with Crohn's disease eventually require surgery,
      and about 25% of patients with ulcerative colitis require colectomy. Treatment of
      ulcerative colitis is generally by corticosteroids for acute disease and
      mesalazine for maintenance, but the range of therapies for Crohn's disease is
      expanding. Alternative therapies include immunosuppressives, enteral nutrition,
      antibiotics, anti-TNF antibody (infliximab), corticosteroids, and surgery. High
      dosages of corticosteroids may provide symptomatic relief in Crohn's disease but 
      do not affect the long term natural history of the disease, and management
      strategies should avoid using steroids whenever possible.

TI  - Anti-inflammatory and growth-stimulating effects precede nutritional restitution 
      during enteral feeding in Crohn disease.
PG  - 270-5
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Exclusive enteral feeding reduces inflammation and improves well
      being, nutrition and growth in children with active Crohn disease. Whether
      improved growth and increases in growth-related proteins are a consequence of
      improved nutrition or a reduced inflammation is not known. This study was
      undertaken to test the hypothesis that changes in growth-related proteins are
      related to decreased inflammation, rather than improvement in nutritional status.
      METHODS: Twelve children with active Crohn disease treated for 6-weeks with
      exclusive enteral feeding were studied at days 0, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 56. The
      Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI), weight, triceps skinfold
      thickness, and midupper arm circumference were recorded. C-reactive protein
      (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), interleukin-6 (IL-6), insulin-like
      growth factor (IGF-I), IGF-binding protein (IGFBP-3), and leptin were measured at
      each visit. Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test was used to compare day 0
      with follow-up data. RESULTS: Significant improvements (P < 0.05) occurred by day
      3 in inflammatory parameters (ESR, IL-6) and by day 7 in PCDAI, CRP, and IGF-I.
      These changes preceded any significant changes in nutritional parameters
      (weight-for-age Z score and midupper arm circumference day 14, triceps skinfold
      thickness day 21). CONCLUSIONS: Early increases in IGF-I during treatment of
      Crohn disease are attributable to the anti-inflammatory effect of the enteral
      feed rather than nutritional restitution.

TI  - Jejunoileal Crohn's disease: a case-control study.
PG  - 160-6
AB  - AIMS: Jejunoileitis might be a severe form of Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of
      the study was to evaluate clinical characteristics, therapeutics modalities and
      long-term outcome in CD patients with jejunoileitis (CDJI). METHODS: All patients
      with CDJI followed in the department of Gastroenterology from 1963 to 1999 were
      included and compared to matched (on Year of CD diagnosis) CD controls without
      jejunoileitis. Data were obtained from retrospective review of medical charts.
      RESULTS: Eighteen patients with CDJI were compared to 36 matched CD controls.
      Median follow-up was 7.65 Years in both groups. At time of CDJI diagnosis the
      following signs were significantly more frequent in patients with jejunoileal CD 
      than in controls: malnutrition (39% vs 3%), pain suggesting obstruction (33% vs
      8%), vomiting (28% vs 5%). Patients with CDJI were more frequently male: M/F
      ratio=2.0/1.1 (P=0.33). Upper digestive involvement (esophagus, stomach and
      duodenum) (67% vs 36%, P=0.04) and small intestine strictures (61% vs 19%,
      P=0.06) were more frequent in CDJI. Initial management was more "aggressive" in
      CDJI than in controls: steroids in 62% vs 30%, azathioprine in 39% vs 3%, total
      parenteral nutrition in 28% vs 8% and surgery in 33% vs 17%. During follow-up,
      the need for azathioprine therapy and surgery were more frequent in CDJI than in 
      controls (extensive small bowel resection in two patients). In 10 of 18 patients,
      jejunoileitis involvement was diagnosed with a median delay of 3.6 Years (range: 
      0.5-14.5) after CD diagnosis and at time of CD diagnosis in the 8 others; outcome
      after CDJI diagnosis was similar in these 2 groups. CONCLUSION: The main
      revealing signs of jejunoileitis in CD patients are obstruction and malnutrition.
      Patients with CDJI require more often azathioprine and surgery than CD patients
      without jejunoileitis. Jejunoileitis is a severe form of CD more frequently
      complicated by extensive small bowel resection.

TI  - Utility of serum antibodies in determining clinical course in pediatric Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 139-46
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The utility of serial measurements of anti-Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae (ASCA) and perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic (p-ANCA) antibodies 
      in Crohn's disease (CD) evolution is unknown. We aimed to study the pattern of
      antibody change and the prognosis of selected outcomes by baseline (at time of
      diagnosis) and serial antibody measurements in pediatric CD patients. METHODS:
      Serum ASCA and p-ANCA antibodies were measured at baseline (n = 154) and repeated
      during follow-up (n = 61) using standard techniques in a cohort of patients
      identified at Hopital Sainte-Justine between 1996 and 1998. Clinical information 
      was abstracted from medical charts. Antibody patterns were examined using mixed
      modeling techniques. The prognostic ability of antibodies for selected outcomes
      was evaluated using logistic regression. RESULTS: Fifteen (24.5%), 18 (29.5%),
      and 11 (18%) patients with serial antibody measurements changed their ASCA-IgA,
      ASCA-IgG, and p-ANCA status (positivity), respectively. No distinct patterns in
      the evolution of antibody titers were noted. Baseline ASCA-IgA positivity
      significantly predicted relapses during disease course (IgA: odds ratio [OR],
      2.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.33-6.35). Serial antibody measurements did
      not predict the occurrence of clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline serum
      antibodies were predictive of a more relapsing disease course in pediatric CD.
      However, the limited variability in the antibodies over time and the inability of
      serial measurements to predict clinical outcomes may limit their use in the
      establishment of intervention strategies.

TI  - Peripheral blood mononuclear cell DNA 6-thioguanine metabolite levels correlate
      with decreased interferon-gamma production in patients with Crohn's disease on
      AZA therapy.
PG  - 133-7
AB  - 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) and its prodrug azathioprine (AZA) are well known for
      their lymphocytotoxic and bone marrow suppressive effects in the management of
      patients with leukemia. Although their immunosuppressive properties are mediated 
      by the active AZA antimetabolite 6-thioguanine (6-TG), its mechanism of action is
      largely unknown. In IBD, a significant inverse correlation has been shown between
      erythrocyte 6-TG metabolite levels and disease activity, further supporting the
      proposed immunosuppressive role for 6-TG. Since leukocytes possess quantitatively
      different purine metabolic pathways compared to erythrocytes, this study aims to 
      measure lymphocyte DNA 6-TG metabolites and correlate levels with the INF-gamma
      and IL-10 cytokine profile in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Forty-six adult
      patients with CD, either naive (17) or on long-term (>4-month) AZA therapy (29), 
      had erythrocyte and lymphocyte DNA 6-TG levels measured by reverse-phase HPLC
      under UV detection (6-TG, 340 nm). Lymphocyte DNA 6-TG was expressed as picomoles
      per milligram of DNA. Lymphocyte DNA 6-TG metabolite levels were correlated with 
      INF-gamma and IL-10 cytokine profiles using the OptEIA kit (Pharmigen).
      Lymphocyte DNA 6-TG metabolite levels correlate with erythrocyte 6-TG levels (P <
      0.03) but not total patient leukocyte levels. Erythrocyte 6-TG metabolite levels 
      correlated (P < 0.01) inversely with INF-gamma but not IL-10 cytokine levels.
      This study suggests a preferential dampening of the TH1 response on exposure to
      6-TG and a possible immunosuppressive mechanism of action for AZA. Future studies
      are needed to determine if cytokine profiles can be used to predict recalcitrant 
      CD to AZA therapy.

TI  - Clinical features and management of Crohn's disease in Chinese patients.
PG  - 183-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: An increasing incidence of Crohn's disease has been found in China in
      recent years. Our study has been focused on evaluating the diversity of the
      clinical manifestations of Crohn's disease in order to improve early diagnostic
      accuracy and therapeutic efficacy. METHODS: Thirty patients with active Crohn's
      disease were enrolled and their clinical data, including diagnostic and
      therapeutic results, were analyzed. Endoscopy combined with histological
      examination of biopsy specimens provided characteristic features of the disease. 
      Transabdominal bowel sonography (TABS) was used for detecting intestinal
      complications. Nutritional supportive therapy was given to 20 subjects with
      active cases of the disease. RESULTS: Most patients were young adults with a
      higher proportion of females to males (ratio: 1.14:1). The disease affects any
      segment or a combination of segments along with the alimentary tract (from the
      mouth to the anus). In this study, the colon and small bowel were the major sites
      involved. Recurrent episodes of abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant and
      watery diarrhea were the most common symptoms. Granulomas were identifiable in
      nearly one-third (30.8%) of all biopsy specimens. In moderate cases of the
      disease, remission was achieved more quickly through the use of oral prednisone
      therapy than with SASP or 5-ASA. Beneficial effects on the host's nutritional
      status were observed. Immunosuppressives were used on an individual basis and
      showed variable therapeutic effects. Sixteen patients had surgery due to
      intestinal obstruction or failure to respond to drug therapies. Rapid improvement
      after surgery was reported. CONCLUSION: Endoscopy (with biopsy) and TABS were
      both crucial procedures for diagnosis. SASP (or 5-ASA) and prednisone were
      effective as inductive therapies. Azathioprine has demonstrable benefits after
      induction therapy with prednisone. Surgery, as an alternative treatment, provided
      another effective choice in selected patients.

TI  - Tumor necrosis factor-alpha antibody for induction of remission in Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - CD003574
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease may be refractory to conventional treatments such as 
      corticosteroids, enteral nutrition and immuno-suppressive agents. A number of
      patients with the disease may also become steroid-dependent leading to increased 
      risk of developing steroid-related adverse effects. Recent studies suggest that
      TNF-a blocking agents may be effective in inducing remission in Crohn's disease. 
      OBJECTIVES: To conduct a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of TNF-a
      blocking agents in inducing remission in patients with active Crohn's disease.
      SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched MEDLINE (1966-June 2003), EMBASE (1984-June 2003),
      the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from the Cochrane Library
      (Issue 2, 2003) and the IBD Review Group Specialized Trials Register. We
      hand-searched the articles cited in each publication obtained. SELECTION
      CRITERIA: We included only randomised controlled trials in which patients with
      active Crohn's disease (defined by a validated Crohn's disease activity index)
      were randomly allocated to receive a TNF-a blocking agent in the treatment arm,
      or to receive placebo or another treatment in the comparison arm. DATA COLLECTION
      AND ANALYSIS: Data extraction and assessment of the methodological quality of
      each trial were independently performed by two reviewers. Any disagreement among 
      reviewers was resolved by consensus. Outcome measures reported in the primary
      studies included clinical remission, clinical response and changes in disease
      activity index. MAIN RESULTS: Ten studies were identified of which 4 met the
      inclusion criteria. The included studies either differed in the type of TNF-a
      blocking agent used or in the way outcomes were assessed to such an extent that
      we considered it inappropriate to combine the data statistically. There is
      evidence from one randomised controlled trial that suggests that a single
      intravenous infusion of the monoclonal antibody cA2, infliximab, may be effective
      for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. There was no difference in
      response rates among infliximab doses of 5, 10 or 20 mg/kg. The results of two
      other trials suggested that CDP571, the genetically engineered human TNF
      monoclonal antibody, may also be effective in reducing disease activity index at 
      2 weeks after an infusion. We did not find any evidence to support the use of
      etanercept in Crohn's disease. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from one
      randomized controlled trial suggests that a single infusion of infliximab may be 
      effective for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. Based on this study, we 
      can recommend a dose of 5 mg/kg. There is also some evidence that CDP571 may be
      effective in inducing remission in Crohn's disease. We did not find any evidence 
      that supports the use of etanercept in Crohn's disease. The period of follow up
      for the patients in these studies was probably too short to allow adequate
      assessment of recently reported serious adverse effects such as tuberculosis and 
      lymphoma.

TI  - Intake of dietary iron is low in patients with Crohn's disease: a case-control
      study.
PG  - 141-8
AB  - Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) often experience Fe deficiency (ID) and
      frequently alter their diet to relieve abdominal symptoms. The present study set 
      out to assess whether patients with CD have dietary habits that lead to low Fe
      intakes and/or reduced bioavailable Fe compared with control subjects. Patients
      with asymptomatic CD were matched to controls (n 91/group). Dietary intakes of Fe
      and contributions from different food groups were compared using a 7 d food
      diary. Promoters and inhibitors of non-haem Fe absorption were investigated and a
      recently published algorithm was applied to assess bioavailable Fe. Fewer
      patients than controls met the reference nutrient intake for Fe (32% CD patients 
      v. 42% controls). Overall, patients had significantly lower mean Fe intakes (by
      2.3 mg/d) and Fe density (by 0.26 mg/MJ (1.1 mg/1000 kcal)) compared with
      controls (both P<0.001). Differences were mainly due to a preference among CD
      patients for low-fibre non-Fe fortified cereals, particularly breakfast cereals. 
      In particular, control subjects had higher Fe intakes than matched CD subjects
      for men (P<0.001) and women less than 50 years (P=0.03). Intakes of both ascorbic
      acid (P<0.001) and phytic acid (P<0.01), but not animal tissue (P=1.0), were
      lower in patients with CD, but these had no overall effect on the predicted
      percentage of bioavailable Fe. Thus total bioavailable Fe was reduced in patients
      with CD due to lower intakes (P<0.01). Dietary Fe intakes are low in CD patients,
      which may contribute to an increased risk of ID and anaemia. Changing dietary
      advice may compromise perceived symptoms of the disease so the need for Fe
      supplementation should be carefully considered.

TI  - Paneth cell granule depletion in the human small intestine under infective and
      nutritional stress.
PG  - 303-9
AB  - Paneth cells are important contributors to the intestinal antimicrobial barrier
      through synthesis and release of antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Animal
      studies indicate that Paneth cell numbers, location and granule morphology are
      altered by infection and zinc status. We examined human tissue to determine
      whether Paneth cell numbers, distribution or granule morphology are altered in
      infective, inflammatory and nutritional disorders. Archival sections from
      infective disorders (giardiasis, cryptosporidiosis, HIV, helminth infection) were
      compared with active inflammatory conditions (coeliac, Crohn's and
      graft-versus-host diseases) and histologically normal tissues. A subset of
      tissues was studied by electron microscopy and TUNEL staining for apoptosis.
      Human defensin-5 (HD5) peptide and mRNA was analysed by immunohistochemistry, in 
      situ hybridization and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain
      reaction. Sections from a tropical population cohort study were then analysed to 
      determine the relationship of granule depletion to infection, nutritional status 
      and plasma zinc concentration. In HIV-related cryptosporidiosis, but not other
      disorders, Paneth cells were reduced in number and markedly depleted of granules.
      Paneth cell granule depletion was associated with reduced HD5 immunoreactivity,
      but this was not due to apoptosis and there was no reduction in mRNA transcripts.
      In the tropical population studied, depletion of granules was associated with
      reduced body mass index, reduced plasma zinc levels and HIV infection. Paneth
      cell granules in human small intestine may be depleted in response to infective
      and nutritional stress. We postulate that this is one mechanism through which
      zinc status influences host susceptibility to intestinal infection.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease and hospital treatment in Italy: the RING multi-centre
      study.
PG  - 63-8
AB  - AIM: To explore the management of chronic inflammatory bowel disease,
      specifically Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, in Italian gastroenterology 
      units. METHODS: The RING (Ricerca Informatizzata in Gastroenterologia) project is
      an observational study collecting hospital discharge forms from 56 centres.
      Factors associated with the length of hospital stay were studied using
      multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: In 24 months starting from August
      2000, out of 29,376 hospital discharge forms, 2131 (7.3%) were collected for
      inflammatory bowel disease (1163 for Crohn's disease and 968 for ulcerative
      colitis). The Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis groups were compared
      according to demographic characteristics, diagnoses, procedures and hospital
      stay. In Crohn's disease, computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging,
      x-rays/barium enema, number of procedures and number of diagnoses were
      significantly associated with a hospital stay longer than 10 days. In ulcerative 
      colitis, this association was found for parenteral nutrition, malnutrition,
      computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging and number of procedures.
      CONCLUSIONS: Crohn's disease was confirmed as a disabling disorder requiring more
      frequent hospital treatment than ulcerative colitis. For the latter, parenteral
      nutrition and malnutrition were related to a longer hospital stay. The number of 
      procedures, especially abdominal computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging, 
      was a major item for both pathologies.

TI  - Short bowel syndrome and Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1069-72
AB  - Patients with Crohn's disease are at high risk for recurrent disease and often
      undergo multiple operations. Our aims were to evaluate surgical management and
      outcome of patients with Crohn's disease who develop short bowel syndrome (SBS)
      and to identify factors leading to this complication. We reviewed the records of 
      170 adult patients with SBS evaluated over a 20-year period. Thirty (18%) had
      Crohn's disease. SBS was defined as an intestinal remnant less than 180 cm with
      associated malabsorption. There were 20 women and 10 men ranging in age from 18
      to 62 years. Eighteen (60%) presented initially with ileocolonic disease, seven
      (23%) with colonic disease, and five (17%) with small intestinal disease. The
      interval from initial diagnosis to development of SBS ranged from 2 to 32 years, 
      with 21 patients (71%) having an interval greater than 15 years. The number of
      resections leading to SBS varied from 2 to 12 with 24 patients (80%) having four 
      or fewer resections. Nineteen patients (63%) had an ostomy. Small intestinal
      remnant length was less than 60 cm in 10 patients, 60 to 120 cm in six patients, 
      and greater than 120 cm in 14 patients. Only one patient underwent
      stricturoplasty before developing SBS. Five patients were initially diagnosed as 
      having ulcerative colitis and underwent a pouch procedure, which was subsequently
      resected. Twenty patients (67%) required parenteral nutrition. Three patients
      have undergone reversed intestinal segment to slow intestinal transit. Two
      patients underwent intestinal transplantation. Two patients have died: one from
      parenteral nutrition-related liver failure and the other after intestinal
      transplantation. Crohn's disease remains a common cause of SBS. Aggressive
      resectional therapy, surgical complications, and errors in initial diagnosis
      contribute to development of SBS in these patients. Selected patients are
      candidates for surgical therapy for SBS.

TI  - [A case of ammonium urate urolithiasis with Crohn's disease].
PG  - 615-7
AB  - A 28-year-old woman suffering from Crohn's disease since 15 years of age
      presented with left back pain. She had undergone a colectomy when she was 20
      years old and an ileostomy when she was 25 years old. She had been treated with
      mesalazine and pernasal nutrition (Elental) Ultrasonography showed left side
      hydronephrosis and a renal stone in the left renal pelvis. Computed x-ray
      tomography revealed a stone measuring 1.5 x 1.0 cm2 at the ureteropelvic
      junction, which was radiolucent on an abdominal radiograph. The renal stone was
      successfully treated with 10 exposures of extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy.
      Ninety eight percent of the passed stone was composed of ammonium urate. Crohn's 
      disease-related poor nutrition and dehydration are presumed to have been possible
      induction factors in the forming of the ammonium urate stone in this case.

PG  - 1283-6
AB  - The authors encountered a patient who had profound hypochloremic metabolic
      alkalosis after developing profuse diarrhea related to rejection of her small
      bowel transplant. Her ileostomy fluid showed massive electrolyte losses and was
      exceptionally high in chloride content. She improved with volume substitution and
      a proton pump inhibitor, although she subsequently required repeat small bowel
      transplant. The authors speculate that an impaired "downregulated in adenoma"
      gene (DRA) that enclodes an apical Cl(-)/HO(-)(HCO(3)) exchanger may have
      contributed to an acquired chloridorrhea in this patient.

TI  - Classification, epidemiology and aetiology.
PG  - 879-93
AB  - Intestinal failure and its most important cause, short-bowel syndrome (SBS), are 
      rare clinical entities leading to a vast complex of symptoms and complications
      with significant morbidity and mortality. Both conditions occur as the result of 
      a massive reduction in enteral nutrient absorptive capacity. Disease
      manifestation is based on aetiological and anatomical characteristics such as
      remaining intestinal length and the presence of a functionally intact colon.
      Congenital and perinatal conditions, for example, intestinal atresia, necrotizing
      enterocolitis (NEC) and intestinal volvulus are the most important causes in
      children. The aetiology in adults is based on diseases inducing loss of
      intestinal function or loss of intestinal surface area after extensive surgical
      resections. The most frequent causes are mesenteric infarction, radiation
      enteritis and Crohn's disease. Knowledge of the epidemiology of intestinal
      failure and SBS is limited, being mainly based on the extrapolated figures of
      home parenteral nutrition centres and single-centre studies. At present, the
      incidence of SBS is estimated to be 2-5 per million.

TI  - NOD2/CARD15 variants are associated with lower weight at diagnosis in children
      with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 2479-84
AB  - OBJECTIVES: NOD2/CARD15 variants have recently been shown to be associated with
      Crohn's disease (CD). No analysis of NOD2/CARD15 gene variants has so far been
      reported in pediatric patients. Therefore, our aim was to analyze NOD2/CARD15
      gene variants in children with CD and to perform genotype-phenotype analyses.
      METHODS: We studied 101 children with CD and 136 healthy controls. Detailed
      phenotypic information was obtained from each patient. Patients were genotyped
      for the three NOD2/CARD15 variants R702W (single nucleotide polymorphism 8
      [SNP8]), G908R (SNP12), and L1007fs (SNP13), and genotype-phenotype correlations 
      were performed. RESULTS: We found 33 NOD2/CARD15 mutations in 29 of 101 patients 
      (29%). The frequency of NOD2 variation was 31% in white (n=87) compared with 11% 
      in controls (chi2=14; p=0.0001; OR=3.7; 95% CI=1.7-7.8). Four white patients but 
      not control subjects were compound heterozygotes. NOD2/CARD15 variants were
      significantly associated with ileal disease (chi2=4.5; p=0.03; OR=5; 95%
      CI=0.9-35.9). Of the children with NOD2/CARD15 variants, 44% were < or =5th
      percentile for weight at diagnosis, whereas only 15% of children without
      mutations were < or =5th percentile (chi2=8.7; p=0.003; OR=4.5; 95% CI=1.4-14.4).
      Similar trends were observed for height but they did not reach statistical
      significance. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that: 1) the three NOD2/CARD15
      variants confer risk to CD in children; 2) NOD2/CARD15 variants are associated
      with ileal disease in children as in adults; and 3) NOD2/CARD15 variants are
      associated with lower weight percentiles at diagnosis in children and a tendency 
      toward lower height percentile, suggesting an association between growth in
      children with CD.

TI  - Infliximab treatment of Crohn disease ileovesical fistula.
PG  - 1097-8
AB  - Ileovesical fistula is a rare inaugural complication of Crohn disease. Current
      approaches associate antibiotics, total parenteral nutrition and various
      combinations of immunomodulatory agents. However, only a minority of fistulas
      subside under conventional treatment, as most of them ultimately require complex 
      surgery to excise and close the structures involved. We report the case of a
      31-year-old patient successfully treated by targeting the local production of
      tumour necrosis factor alpha with infliximab.

TI  - Predictive factors of response of perianal Crohn's disease to azathioprine or
      6-mercaptopurine.
PG  - 1469-75
AB  - PURPOSE: This study was designed to evaluate the predictive factors of response
      of perianal Crohn's disease to azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine. METHODS:
      Ninety-four patients (65 females; mean age, 31 years) with active perianal
      Crohn's disease were treated with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine for more than 
      6 (median, 27) months (median azathioprine dose, 2 mg/kg/day). The evolution of
      perianal lesions during azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine therapy was analyzed
      retrospectively. Patients who had a clear anatomic improvement (fistula closure, 
      fissure healing, stricture dilatation) and who did not develop any perianal
      complications requiring an antibiotic course or surgical intervention were
      considered responders regarding their perianal disease. RESULTS: Three years
      after inclusion, the cumulative probabilities of remaining free of perianal
      complication and achieving a clear anatomic improvement were 0.47 (95 percent
      confidence interval, 0.36-0.58) and 0.4 (95 percent confidence interval,
      0.29-0.53), respectively. On the whole, 27 patients (29 percent) were responders 
      to azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine therapy. The absence of fistula, duration of 
      perianal disease shorter than 22 months, and aged 40 years or older at inclusion 
      were three independent factors associated with response to azathioprine or
      6-mercaptopurine therapy. There was no correlation between the response of
      perianal lesions and the achievement of intestinal remission with azathioprine or
      6-mercaptopurine. CONCLUSION: One-third of patients with perianal lesions of
      Crohn's disease demonstrated a clear improvement during azathioprine or
      6-mercaptopurine therapy. Patients aged 40 years or older with a recent perianal 
      disease and without fistula were the best responders.

TI  - Hyperhomocystinemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 586-90
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Thromboembolism is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in 
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) 
      is a risk factor for vascular disease and has been implicated as a mediator of
      thromboembolic events in adults with IBD. The authors studied the link between
      tHcy and IBD in children, in whom associations may be clearer, and investigated
      associations with plasma von Willebrand factor antigen, a marker of vascular
      damage. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 43 patients with IBD (27
      Crohn disease, 9 ulcerative colitis, and 7 indeterminate colitis) and 46 control 
      subjects from a pediatric gastroenterology clinic. Plasma tHcy, plasma 5-methyl
      tetrahydrofolate, red cell folate, plasma vitamin B12, plasma von Willebrand
      factor antigen, and methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) genotype (for
      the C677T mutation) were measured. RESULTS: Plasma tHcy concentrations were
      higher in children with IBD than in control subjects, when corrected for age (P <
      0.05), and plasma tHcy was negatively correlated with plasma 5 methyl
      tetrahydrofolate (P < 0.0005). Plasma 5 methyl tetrahydrofolate and age were the 
      main predictors of plasma tHcy. Neither MTHFR genotype nor von Willebrand factor 
      showed any association with any other measure, and there were no differences
      between children with IBD and control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated plasma tHcy
      is a consequence of IBD in children, probably mediated by poor folate status
      associated with diet or the pathophysiology of the disease.

PG  - 525-31
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of newly
      diagnosed pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in a large population-based 
      model. STUDY DESIGN: All pediatric gastroenterologists providing care for
      Wisconsin children voluntarily identified all new cases of IBD during a 2-year
      period. Demographic and clinical data were sent to a central registry
      prospectively for analysis. RESULTS: The incidence of IBD in Wisconsin children
      was 7.05 per 100,000, whereas the incidence for Crohn's disease was 4.56, more
      than twice the rate of ulcerative colitis (2.14). An equal IBD incidence occurred
      among all ethnic groups, and children from sparsely and densely populated
      counties were equally affected. The majority (89%) of new IBD diagnoses were
      nonfamilial. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides novel, prospective, and
      comprehensive information on pediatric IBD incidence within the United States.
      The surprisingly high incidence of pediatric IBD, the predominance of Crohn's
      disease over ulcerative colitis, the low frequency of patients with a family
      history, the equal distribution of IBD among all racial and ethnic groups, and
      the lack of a modulatory effect of urbanization on IBD incidence collectively
      suggest that the clinical spectrum of IBD is still evolving and point to
      environmental factors contributing to the pathogenesis.

TI  - Selenium is depleted in Crohn's disease on enteral nutrition.
PG  - 266-70
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: [corrected] Selenium is an important trace element and its
      deficiency has been reported to be associated with cardiomyopathy or
      gastrointestinal cancer. The aim of this study is to clarify the selenium status 
      in Crohn's disease (CD) on enteral nutrition. METHODS: We measured serum selenium
      concentrations in 53 patients with CD and compared them with those in 21 healthy 
      controls. Twenty-nine patients were under the treatment by enteral nutrition (EN 
      group), and the remaining 24 patients were free from formulated enteral nutrition
      (non-EN group). RESULTS: While the serum selenium concentration in the non-EN
      group was not decreased when compared to controls, the value in the EN group was 
      significantly lower than those in the non-EN group and in controls. Clinical
      manifestations of selenium deficiency were found in a patient on exclusive
      enteral nutrition. In the EN group, the serum selenium concentration showed an
      inverse correlation with the duration and the daily dose of enteral nutrition. In
      the non-EN group, the serum selenium concentrations were inversely correlated
      with the Crohn's disease activity index. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that 
      patients with CD on enteral nutrition are at risk for selenium deficiency and
      that even patients without enteral nutrition may develop selenium deficiency at
      the active phase of the disease.

TI  - Colovaginal fistulas. Etiology and management.
PG  - 489-95
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the diagnosis and treatment of colovaginal fistulas from
      various causes. DATA SOURCES: Papers on colovaginal fistulas were identified
      using Ovid and PubMed. The search terms used were as follows: colovaginal
      fistulas, rectovaginal fistulas, diverticular disease and fistulas. METHODS OF
      STUDY: Articles were selected based on their relevance to colovaginal fistulas
      and were then further subdivided into epidemiology, etiology, presentation,
      diagnosis and management. RESULTS: English-language papers were selected based on
      their relevance to all aspects of colovaginal fistulas. CONCLUSION: Optimizing
      nutrition is paramount prior to surgery. Medical management rarely corrects the
      problem. Diverticular colovaginal fistulas arise in patients who have previously 
      undergone a hysterectomy. Radiation-related fistulas often involve the distal
      sigmoid colon and rectum, and recurrent cancer must be ruled out. Often symptoms 
      are associated with radiation cystitis and terminal ileitis. When indicated,
      restoration of intestinal continuity is preferred. Malignant fistulas carry a
      poor prognosis, and when surgical removal is not practical, they are treated
      palliatively with fecal diversion or an endoluminal stent. Those arising from
      inflammatory bowel disease most frequently arise due to Crohn's disease, and
      extirpation of diseased bowel and associated abscess will successfully treat the 
      condition. Fistulas arising from ulcerative colitis can be malignant. There
      remains a small role for colostomy as a nondefinitive procedure to alleviate
      symptoms. Colovaginal fistulas require a multidisciplinary approach and focused
      diagnostics, successful treatment can dramatically improve the patient's quality 
      of life.

TI  - The frequency of vitamin D deficiency in adults with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 473-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency is a putative, pathogenic cofactor in the
      increase in osteopenia and osteoporosis seen in patients with Crohn's disease.
      OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of low serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 (25-OHD)
      levels and the associated alterations in bone mineral density in a cohort of
      adults with Crohn's disease. METHODS: 25-OHD levels were determined in 242
      consecutive patients with Crohn's disease seen in two tertiary inflammatory bowel
      disease referral centres. Bone mineral density was assessed by dual energy x-ray 
      absorptiometry. RESULTS: Nineteen (8%) patients exhibited vitamin D deficiency
      (25-OHD less than 25 nmol/L) and 52 (22%) patients exhibited vitamin D
      insufficiency (25-OHD less than 40 nmol/L). Mean T-scores at the lumbar spine,
      femoral neck, total hip and ultradistal radius in the group with low 25-OHD did
      not differ from those of the normal 25-OHD group. Serum alkaline phosphatase and 
      parathyroid hormone levels were higher in the low 25-OHD group than in the normal
      group. Decreased red blood cell (RBC) folate predicted low 25-OHD in male
      patients, while smoking, RBC folate and serum iron predicted low 25-OHD in female
      patients. The rate of low 25-OHD deficiency in the winter was significantly
      higher than that in the summer (11.9% versus 2.8%, respectively). CONCLUSION:
      Vitamin D-deficient Crohn's disease patients exhibit biochemical evidence of
      metabolic bone disease, without detectable differences in bone mineral density.
      Sunlight exposure, nutrition and smoking status were predictors of vitamin D
      deficiency in this patient cohort.

TI  - Essential fatty acid status in paediatric Crohn's disease: relationship with
      disease activity and nutritional status.
PG  - 433-42
AB  - BACKGROUND: Active paediatric Crohn's disease is associated with nutritional
      deficiencies and altered nutrient intake. The availability of essential fatty
      acids (linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids) or their derivatives (arachidonic and 
      eicosapentaenoic acids) may alter in plasma and cell membrane phospholipid in
      protein-energy malnutrition in children and in Crohn's disease in adults. AIM: To
      investigate the relationship of fatty acid phospholipid profiles with disease
      activity and nutritional status in paediatric Crohn's disease. METHODS: The fatty
      acid (proportionate) composition of plasma and erythrocyte phosphatidylcholine
      was determined in 30 patients (10.3-17.0 years) stratified into active and
      quiescent Crohn's disease (paediatric Crohn's disease activity index) and high
      and low body mass (body mass index centile). RESULTS: In plasma
      phosphatidylcholine, active disease activity was associated with a lower level of
      alpha-linolenic acid compared with that in quiescent disease (P < 0.05). A body
      mass index below the 50th centile was associated with active Crohn's disease, low
      linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids and high arachidonic acid (P < 0.05) in plasma
      phosphatidylcholine, and low alpha-linolenic acid in erythrocyte
      phosphatidylcholine. These findings could not be explained through differences in
      habitual dietary fat intake. CONCLUSION: In paediatric Crohn's disease, a low
      body mass index centile and high disease activity are associated with altered
      profiles of essential fatty acids and their derivatives, which may reflect
      altered metabolic demand.

TI  - Dermatologic manifestations of Crohn disease in children: response to infliximab.
PG  - 150-4
AB  - Dermatologic extraintestinal manifestations of Crohn disease may be refractory to
      treatment with corticosteroids and immunomodulators. The authors describe four
      children with Crohn disease with dermatologic manifestations: pyoderma
      gangrenosum, orofacial involvement, erythema nodosum, and idiopathic lymphedema. 
      These dermatologic conditions were unresponsive to conventional therapy but had
      rapid and sustained response to the anti-TNF-alpha antibody infliximab. No
      adverse reactions occurred. Infliximab should be considered for treating the
      extraintestinal dermatologic manifestations of Crohn disease in children.

TI  - Body composition in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a population-based 
      study.
PG  - 1556-62
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Weight loss and nutritional depletion are common features of
      inflammatory bowel disease. Our aim was to assess body composition in patients
      with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) and to evaluate possible
      differences between the patient groups and healthy subjects. METHODS: A total of 
      60 patients with CD, 60 patients with UC, and 60 healthy subjects were
      investigated. Each group consisted of 24 men and 36 women. Body composition was
      measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry and Z scores were obtained by comparison to
      age- and sex-matched normal values. RESULTS: Bone mineral content and lean body
      mass were significantly lower in patients with CD compared with patients with UC 
      and healthy subjects. The body composition of CD men was more strongly affected
      than that of women. UC patients had significantly higher fat mass and body mass
      index than patients with CD and healthy subjects. There was no difference in the 
      percentage of fat mass between the two patient groups. Corticosteroid treatment
      and smoking had a negative impact on bone mineral content and lean body mass in
      CD patients independently of each other. CONCLUSIONS: CD was associated with
      disturbances in body composition: both bone mineral content and lean body mass
      were significantly reduced, especially in men with CD. Corticosteroid therapy and
      smoking had a significant influence on body composition in patients with CD. When
      studying the effects of inflammatory bowel disease on body composition and
      nutritional status, patients with CD and UC should be evaluated separately.

TI  - Cytokine tissue levels as markers of disease activity in pediatric Crohn disease.
PG  - 456-61
AB  - The mucosal immune system is overactivated in Crohn disease (CD) and viral
      infections have been associated with clinical exacerbations. To investigate the
      potential association between mucosal inflammation and the cytokines involved in 
      the early response to viruses, we analyzed colonic tissue levels of IL-2Ralpha,
      interferon-alpha, and IL-15 in CD. Patients undergoing diagnostic colonoscopy
      were classified into controls (n = 22) and three CD groups based on the
      histologic severity of inflammation and clinical activity: a) severely active CD 
      (n = 3); b) mild to moderately active CD (n = 14); and c) quiescent CD (n = 23). 
      Rectal biopsies (two per patient) were homogenized and cytokine levels determined
      by ELISA kits. Statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA with Tukey and Scheffe
      tests. IL-2Ralpha levels were increased in the active CD group compared with the 
      quiescent CD group: a) 405 +/- 87, b) 159 +/- 31, and c) 33 +/- 15 pg/mg DNA (p <
      0.001). The latter group was similar to controls (39 +/- 20 pg/mg DNA).
      Furthermore, a linear correlation (r = 0.98) between IL-2Ralpha and disease
      activity (Van Hees index) was observed. IL-15 levels were also higher in active
      compared with quiescent CD and controls: a) 0.69 +/- 0.23 and b) 0.72 +/- 0.31
      versus c) 0.28 +/- 0.21 and 0.28 +/- 0.14 pg/mg DNA for controls (p < 0.05).
      Interferon-alpha levels were undetectable in all samples. Our data suggest that
      IL-2Ralpha tissue levels correlate with CD activity. IL-15 is also overproduced
      in inflamed CD tissue. The lack of a parallel elevation of interferon-alpha does 
      not support a role for viral induction of IL-15 in inflamed CD samples.

TI  - Modulation of cytokine release from colonic explants by bacterial antigens in
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 108-14
AB  - The intestinal flora play an important role in experimental colitis and
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Using colonic explant cultures from 132 IBD and
      control subjects, we examined tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha),
      interleukin (IL)-1 and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) production in
      vitro in response to bacterial activators. Unstimulated TNF-alpha release was
      increased significantly in rectal biopsies from involved IBD tissue, correlating 
      with inflammation severity. Whereas lipopolysaccharide (LPS) only moderately
      stimulated TNF-alpha production from inflamed tissue, pokeweed mitogen (PWM)
      induced its release in all groups, with a stronger response in involved IBD
      tissue. Superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) had a similar, but weaker
      effect. SEB was observed to be the strongest inducer of TNF-alpha for all groups,
      again with a more marked response in inflamed tissue. Stimulated release of IL-1 
      was considerably less than for TNF-alpha. The superantigens' superior potency
      over LPS was not as marked for IL-1 as it was for TNF-alpha. In addition to IL-1,
      IL-1RA release was also triggered by the bacterial products. The net effect of
      activation on the IL-1RA/IL-1 ratio was relatively modest. Release of the
      proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-1, as well as that of the
      anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-1RA was increased by incubation of colonic tissue
      with bacterial factors. TNF-alpha production and release was increased
      significantly in involved colonic explants from IBD. SEB was even capable of
      inducing TNF-alpha release from uninvolved colonic tissue.

TI  - The significance of routine duodenal biopsies in pediatric patients undergoing
      upper intestinal endoscopy.
PG  - 39-41
AB  - GOALS: To determine the significance of performing routine duodenal biopsies
      during upper intestinal endoscopy in a pediatric population and to evaluate their
      contribution to the overall diagnosis. BACKGROUND: Performing duodenal biopsy
      during every upper endoscopy regardless of the indication for endoscopy and the
      macroscopic findings, is a controversial topic. Advocates of performing routine
      biopsies argue that unexpected pathology such as villous atrophy, may have
      significant clinical implications. Opponents argue that the yield of performing a
      biopsy on an apparently normal mucosa is low. STUDY: Duodenal biopsies, routinely
      taken from 201 pediatric patients during upper endoscopy over a 26-month period
      were retrospectively reviewed. Duodenal biopsies taken during this period for
      suspected mucosal lesions were not included in the analysis. Indications for
      endoscopy included suspected peptic disease, gastroesophageal reflux, unexplained
      vomiting, abdominal pain, iron deficiency anemia and Crohn disease. RESULTS: Of
      the 201 sets of biopsies reviewed, 159 (79.1%) were normal, 7 had insufficient
      material for evaluation and 35 (17.4%) carried abnormalities that included: 10
      Giardia lamblia (4.9%), 13 mild chronic inflammation (6.5%), and 8 increased
      intraepithelial lymphocytes (3.9%). Two biopsies showed mixed acute and chronic
      inflammation, 1 showed lymphatic dilatation and 1 had a mild mucosal lesion. The 
      risk for microscopic pathology in the duodenum was higher when Helicobacter
      pylori was present in the gastric biopsy (25.98% vs. 12.16% P < 0.02). The
      negative predictive value of a normal appearing duodenal mucosa was 81.5%,
      implying that a normal appearing mucosa does not rule out pathology. No
      complications were encountered in our series. CONCLUSION: We suggest that the
      inclusion of routine duodenal biopsies as part of upper endoscopy in pediatric
      patients should be considered favorably. This practice may yield additional
      pathologic findings that otherwise could have been missed. It should be done
      regardless of the indication for endoscopy or the gross appearance of the mucosa.
      This practice does not increase the risk of the procedure.

TI  - The state of the art in the management of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 81-92
AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), collectively known as
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), afflict an estimated one million Americans and 
      produce symptoms that impair quality of life and ability to function. Progress in
      IBD management strategies has led to optimized approaches for achieving the two
      primary clinical goals of therapy: induction and maintenance of remission.
      Although surgery is indicated to treat refractory disease or specific
      complications, pharmacotherapy is the cornerstone of IBD management. The efficacy
      of aminosalicylates for induction of remission in mild to moderate UC and CD is
      well established, as is their role for maintenance of remission in UC. The
      sulfa-free mesalamine formulation offers an adverse effect profile similar to
      that of placebo, enabling the administration of higher, more effective doses.
      Although corticosteroids provide potent anti-inflammatory effects, their benefits
      are countermanded by the risk of intolerable and serious adverse effects, and
      they are ineffective for maintenance therapy. Other agents effective in inducing 
      or maintaining remission are azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, infliximab,
      cyclosporine, methotrexate, and antibiotics. Ongoing clinical trials of
      experimental therapies will generate new tools for IBD treatment. Currently, a
      broad range of options allows physicians to tailor treatment to each patient's
      needs and preferences. Such considerations are essential for maximizing adherence
      to therapy.

TI  - Granulomatous pulmonary disease in a child: an unusual presentation of Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 76-80
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel which may be
      associated with an extensive list of extraintestinal manifestations involving
      almost every organ system. The most common organs involved are the eyes, skin,
      joints, and liver. Symptomatic bronchopulmonary disorders have been reported only
      rarely in pediatric CD. We report on an 11-year-old child who had a recurrent
      cough and increasing dyspnea with exercise for 8 months before developing any
      gastrointestinal symptoms. He was demonstrated to have granulomatous inflammation
      of the lung, as well as of the gastrointestinal tract. Similarities between CD
      and sarcoidosis are discussed.

PG  - 562-566
LID - 10.1016/S1091-255X(02)00132-4 [doi]
AB  - This paper examines the safety and feasibility of providing short-term, in-home
      total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for patients with inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) for whom the alternative is prolonged hospitalization or early surgery. The
      records of all patients with IBD who were receiving temporary home TPN between
      June 1996 and July 2000 were reviewed. A quality-of-life phone interview was
      conducted at the time of review. Fifteen patients (11 men and 4 women) were
      identified whose average age was 35 years. The underlying diagnosis was Crohn's
      disease in 10 and ulcerative colitis in five. The indications for home TPN were
      complex internal fistulas and resolving sepsis in two, postoperative septic
      complications (anastomotic leak/enterocutaneous fistula) in five, high-output
      proximal stomas in four, prolonged ileus/partial obstruction in three, and
      spontaneous enterocutaneous fistula in one. The average duration of home TPN was 
      75 days (range 7 to 240 days). Two patients (13%) failed home TPN (1 with
      uncontrolled sepsis; 1 with dehydration) and were readmitted to the hospital.
      Home TPN was discontinued in one patient whose enterocutaneous fistula failed to 
      heal with nonoperative treatment. Home TPN was successful in 12 patients (80%):
      eight (53%) who underwent planned definitive surgery and four (27%) whose
      conditions resolved without surgery. Complications of home TPN were line sepsis
      and pulmonary aspergillosis in one patient. All patients preferred home TPN to
      further hospitalization and reported good or excellent quality of life at home.
      Home TPN is a safe alternative to prolonged hospitalization or early surgery in
      patients with complicated IBD.

TI  - Infliximab (REMICADE) therapy in the treatment of pediatric Crohn's disease.
PG  - 833-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of a
      single infusion of infliximab in the treatment of pediatric Crohn's disease (CD).
      METHODS: A total of 21 pediatric CD patients were enrolled at seven study centers
      and randomized to receive a single infusion of infliximab 1 mg/kg (n = 6), 5
      mg/kg (n = 7), or 10 mg/kg (n = 8) over at least 2 hrs at week 0 in this
      multicenter, open-label, dose-blinded trial. Efficacy assessments, including the 
      Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI), modified CDAI, C-reactive
      protein concentration (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
      determinations, were made at screening and at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12. Adverse
      events were assessed throughout study participation. RESULTS: Improvements in the
      PCDAI, modified CDAI, ESR, and CRP were observed with all infliximab doses,
      beginning at week 1. On average, all treated patients experienced approximately
      50% improvement in the PCDAI by week 2. By week 12, the PCDAI remained
      approximately 30% improved from baseline. During the study, all 21 patients
      (100%) achieved a clinical response, and 10 patients (48%) achieved clinical
      remission. There were no infusion reactions in any of the treatment arms.
      CONCLUSIONS: The results of this trial suggest that infliximab may be safe and
      effective as short-term therapy of medically refractory moderate to severe CD in 
      a pediatric population.

TI  - Pharmacological nutrition in inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 57-64
AB  - Inflammatory Bowel Diseases--ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease--are chronic 
      gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases of unknown etiology. Decreased oral
      intake, malabsorption, accelerated nutrient losses, increased requirements, and
      drug-nutrient interactions cause nutritional and functional deficiencies that
      require proper correction by nutritional therapy. The goals of the different
      forms of nutritional therapy are to correct nutritional disturbances and to
      modulate inflammatory response, thus influencing disease activity. Nutritional
      intervention may improve outcome in certain individuals; however, because of the 
      costs and complications of such therapy, careful selection is warranted. Total
      parenteral nutrition has been used to correct and prevent nutritional
      disturbances and to promote bowel rest during active disease, mainly in cases of 
      digestive fistulae with a high output. Its use should be reserved for patients
      who cannot tolerate enteral nutrition. Enteral nutrition is effective in inducing
      clinical remission of disease in adults and promoting growth in children. Recent 
      research has focused on the use of specific nutrients as primary treatment
      agents. Although some reports have indicated that glutamine, short-chain fatty
      acids, antioxidants and immunonutrition with omega-3 fatty acids are an important
      therapeutic alternative in the management of inflammatory bowel diseases, the
      beneficial reported effects have yet to be translated into the clinical practice.
      The real efficacy of these nutrients still need further evaluation through
      prospective and randomized trials.

TI  - Strictureplasty: An alternative approach in long segment bowel stenosis Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 814-8
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Intestinal resection is the most frequent surgical procedure 
      for bowel stenoses in Crohn's disease (CD). Recurrence of strictures,
      particularly with ileocolonic disease, often requires resection of lengthy
      segments of bowel, potentially resulting in short bowel syndrome. Different
      techniques of strictureplasty, such as those described by Mikulicz, Finney and
      Michelassi, are used in adults. However, these procedures are uncommon in
      pediatric surgery. The authors report their experience with different techniques 
      of strictureplasty and with their modified Michelassi technique for the surgical 
      treatment of long intestinal strictures caused by CD. METHODS: Five adolescents
      (2 boys; 3 girls; mean age, 16 age; range, 14 to 20 years) with severe
      ileocolonic stenoses and intestinal obstruction, not responsive to medical and
      nutritional therapy, were treated with different strictureplasty techniques. In 3
      of them the modified side-to-side Michelassi technique was used. RESULTS: No
      postoperative complications occurred. After a mean follow-up of 20.5 months
      (range, 6 to 28 months), patients are free of symptoms with good nutritional
      status and off steroid therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Strictureplasty is a good and
      effective surgical option for sparing bowel length in CD patients with extensive 
      intestinal strictures.

TI  - A prospective study of the efficacy and tolerance of a chimeric antibody to tumor
      necrosis factors (remicade) in severe pediatric crohn disease.
PG  - 632-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of infliximab in children with 
      severe Crohn disease (CD), the authors prospectively monitored 21 children aged
      15 +/- 2 years with severe CD who they treated with infliximab (5 mg/kg) on days 
      0, 15, and 45. One patient received only one injection. Eighteen patients were
      corticosteroid dependent, and 6 were receiving parenteral nutrition. Three
      patients were corticoid resistant (1 mg/kg/d >15 days). Sixteen had perianal
      disease. RESULTS: The Harvey-Bradshaw index (HB) decreased from 8 +/- 3 on day 0 
      to 1 +/- 2 on day 45 (P = 0.001). The inflammation factors decreased (P = 0.001),
      and albumin increased (P = 0.002). Nineteen children were in complete remission
      (HB < 4) on day 45, and 2 had improved (HB = -6 points). Tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha (TNFalpha) in the stools (n = 16) decreased (P = 0.04). All perianal
      fistulas (n = 12) were closed by day 90. Fourteen of 21 patients had stopped
      taking steroids at 3 months, and all had stopped parenteral nutrition. Growth
      velocity was significantly greater after infliximab administration (Z score,
      +0.5) than before (-0.45; P = 0.004). Nineteen of 21 patients had relapsed (90%) 
      at 1 year despite continued immunosuppressors. Seven had surgery because of an
      uncontrolled relapse ( 5), stenosis ( 1), or fistula ( 1). Six patients developed
      antinuclear antibodies (1/40-1/640e), and two had anti-DNA antibodies.
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) values increased
      (>100-fold) in eight patients. One child developed an anaphylactic reaction to
      the medication, and one had a catheter-related sepsis. CONCLUSION: Infliximab
      produces spectacular results for children with severe CD and is well tolerated.
      However, its effect is transitory for many (90%), with frequent relapses despite 
      continued immunosuppressors. Long-term management with infliximab should be
      tested despite its worrying side effects.

TI  - CCR4 is an up-regulated chemokine receptor of peripheral blood memory CD4+ T
      cells in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 332-8
AB  - Several chemokine receptors are expressed selectively on the surface of T cells
      depending on their polarization. The aim of this study was to characterize
      chemokine receptor expression in peripheral blood memory T cells in Crohn's
      disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), and to correlate the expression with
      disease activity. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from
      24 patients with CD, 30 patients with UC, 24 normal controls and 10 disease
      controls. PBMCs were stained by anti-CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, CXCR3, CD4, CD8, CD45RO
      and beta 7 integrin, and the expression of the chemokine receptors were
      determined by flow cytometry. CCR4 expression on memory T cells was significantly
      lower in UC than in CD or normal controls, and that of memory CD4+ T and beta
      7(high) memory CD4+ T cells was significantly higher in CD than in UC or normal
      controls. CCR4 expression on memory CD4+ T cells exhibited significant positive
      correlation with disease activity in CD, and this decreased significantly after
      treatment. Such a decrease was not found in the disease controls. CCR5 and CXCR3 
      expression on memory CD8+ T cells was significantly lower in CD than in normal
      controls. CXCR3 expression on beta 7(high) memory CD4+ T and CXCR3 expression on 
      memory CD8+ T cells were lower in UC than in normal controls. These findings
      suggest that in peripheral blood memory T cells, chemokine receptor expression is
      different between CD and UC. Enhancement of CCR4 and suppression of CCR5 and
      CXCR3 seem to be the characteristic chemokine receptor profile in peripheral
      blood memory T cells of CD.

PG  - 165-73
AB  - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are specific inflammatory bowel diseases. 
      Quality of life can be considerably limited. It does not depend on the form of
      therapy that Crohn's disease is highly recurrent, whereas colitis ulcerosa is
      curable by proctocolectomy. For both forms of disease surgery is an important
      option. It has to be included early in the therapy concept and not as last
      choice. Quality of life in patients with Crohn's disease can be raised
      significantly by surgery. Meticulous selection of the patients are essential to
      the policy of surgery as well as a regular aftercare. Best profit for those
      patients are treatment with an interdisciplinary team, consisting of
      gastroenterologists, nutrition advisers, psychologists, surgeons and
      radiologists.

TI  - An update on the medical treatment of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 15-22
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic transmural inflammation that may involve any
      part of the alimentary tract. The affected patients show peculiar metabolic
      characteristics; they often have a reduced body weight, due to reduction of lipid
      stores (in spite of lean mass depletion) and an increased utilization of lipids
      as fuel substrate. An alteration of nutritional status, up to real malnutrition, 
      is common in CD and malnutrition's effects influence the course of disease,
      acting as independent factors. We will give a description of the main
      pharmacological approaches in CD management; the first line therapy for CD
      patients remains the combinations of aminosalicylates, antibiotics,
      corticosteroids and immunomodulatory agents. The development of new biological
      agents for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases has added to the growing 
      armamentarium of available therapy. We also will explain the importance of
      enteral nutrition, whose importance goes over the simple amelioration of
      nutritional status, especially in childhood CD, where it has shown to be as
      effective as traditional therapy.

TI  - Selenium deficiency in a patient with Crohn's disease receiving long-term total
      parenteral nutrition.
PG  - 154-7
AB  - We report a case of selenium deficiency in a patient with Crohn's disease on
      long-term total parenteral nutrition (TPN). She manifested lassitude of the legs,
      discoloration of the nail beds, and macrocytosis. Since her plasma selenium level
      was found to be below the measurable level, we diagnosed this case as selenium
      deficiency. After intravenous administration of sodium selenite, her symptoms
      were reversed. Careful attention should be paid to selenium deficiency when a
      patient receives long-term TPN; supplementary administration of selenium via TPN 
      may be required because selenium is often not routinely added to TPN
      formulations.

TI  - Increasing incidence of Crohn's disease in Victorian children.
PG  - 329-32
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of Crohn's disease has been increasing in Western
      communities, but there are no published studies which have examined this change
      in children in Australia. The centralization of pediatric gastroenterology
      services in Victoria provides an opportunity to examine these changes within one 
      state. METHODS: We undertook a retrospective study over a 31-year period of all
      children aged 16 years or less initially diagnosed with Crohn's disease at either
      the Royal Children's Hospital, or Monash Medical Center, Melbourne, Victoria.
      RESULTS: We identified 351 patients who met the diagnostic criteria between 1971 
      and 2001. The incidence of Crohn's disease in children aged 16 years or less rose
      from 0.128 to 2.0 per 100,000 per year over the three decades (r = 0.964, P <
      0.01). There was a disproportionate over-representation of children from an urban
      background (incidence rate ratio 1.66, 95% CI 1.28-2.16). Children currently
      being diagnosed had on average a lower erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and
      higher albumin than in previous decades. The use of flexible endoscopy has
      increased markedly (1970s: 60%; 1990s: 96%, P < 0.05) and the proportion of
      children recognized at diagnosis with upper gastrointestinal and colonic
      involvement has increased significantly. CONCLUSION: There has been a significant
      increase in the incidence of Crohn's disease in Victorian children. The pattern
      of disease has also changed with colonic disease now more frequent, and
      inflammatory indices less abnormal. The increased use of endoscopy has
      established the frequent involvement of the upper gastrointestinal tract.

TI  - Supplement of a chitosan and ascorbic acid mixture for Crohn's disease: a pilot
      study.
PG  - 137-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease remains unclear, dietary 
      fat is thought to exacerbate intestinal inflammation. Chitosan is a
      water-insoluble dietary fiber, and a chitosan and ascorbic acid mixture has been 
      shown in rats to increase fecal fat excretion without affecting protein
      digestibility. However, it remains unclear whether a chitosan and ascorbic acid
      mixture is safe and effective for patients with Crohn's disease. We designed a
      pilot trial to investigate the tolerability and amount of fat excretion after the
      oral administration of a chitosan and ascorbic mixture for inactive Crohn's
      disease. METHODS: Eleven outpatients were given seven tablets daily of a chitosan
      and ascorbic mixture (chitosan was given at 1.05 g/d) for 8 wk. Patients did not 
      interrupt their respective therapies for Crohn's disease. RESULTS: The bowel
      movements of most patients increased slightly during the study. Nutritional and
      inflammatory markers in patients did not differ before and after treatment. The
      chitosan and ascorbic acid mixture significantly increased the fat concentration 
      in the feces during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that oral
      administration of a chitosan and ascorbic acid mixture in patients with Crohn's
      disease is tolerable and increases fecal fat excretion without affecting disease 
      activity.

TI  - Antioxidant vitamin supplementation in Crohn's disease decreases oxidative
      stress. a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 348-53
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We showed previously that patients with Crohn's disease (CD) had
      increased oxidative stress and lower antioxidant vitamins compared with healthy
      controls. This is despite inactive or mildly active disease and maintenance
      therapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate in these patients the effects of
      antioxidant vitamin supplementation on oxidative stress. METHODS: This is a
      randomized controlled trial where stable but oxidatively stressed CD subjects (n 
      = 57) were supplemented with vitamins E (800 IU) and C (1000 mg) or their placebo
      for 4 wk. Oxidative stress measured by breath pentane and ethane output, plasma
      lipid peroxides, and F2-isoprostane was assessed at baseline and at 4 wk. Disease
      activity was also monitored by measuring CD activity index and plasma
      orosomucoid. RESULTS: During supplementation, plasma vitamin C and
      alpha-tocopherol increased and all indices of oxidative stress decreased
      significantly. Disease activity remained stable. CONCLUSIONS: In this population,
      vitamin E and C supplementation resulted in a significant reduction in oxidative 
      stress. This suggests that patients with inactive or mildly active CD can be
      oxidatively stressed and have increased requirement in antioxidant vitamins.

TI  - Enteral and parenteral nutrition therapy for Crohn's disease.
PG  - 323-32
AB  - Even with the development of new therapeutic agents, such as infliximab, enteral 
      nutrition (EN) and parenteral nutrition (PN) therapies remain important for the
      treatment of Crohn's disease because Crohn's patients often require nutritional
      support. Furthermore, nutritional therapies can be used in the control of disease
      activity. Elemental diets, which are mainly used in EN therapy, consist of a
      refined amino acid mixture, glucose or maltodextrins and minimal essential fatty 
      acids. EN therapy can reduce mucosal inflammation by the elimination of dietary
      antigens, which induce inflammation, and by reductions in fat, which activates
      inflammation. EN is applied not only as induction therapy, but also as
      maintenance therapy after remission (home EN). However, the unpalatability of
      elemental diets, difficulties related to self-intubation and the high cost of EN 
      have limited its application as a primary therapy in western countries. PN is
      utilized as complete bowel rest supporting nutrition. However, since the
      therapeutic efficacies of EN and PN are similar, the indications for PN are
      limited and PN is mainly utilized in patients with bowel obstructions or severe
      fistulas. PN is also used as home therapy in the treatment of Crohn's patients
      with short bowel syndrome. However, long-term PN sometimes causes
      life-threatening complications including catheter-induced sepsis, liver failure
      and lethal mineral deficiencies. We suggest that gastroenterologists should
      recognize the advantages and limitations of all therapies and choose carefully or
      combine various therapies in order to maintain the quality of life in individual 
      patients even if in cases where remission can not be achieved.

TI  - Review article: nutrition and adult inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 307-20
AB  - Major advances in the understanding of the aetio-pathogenesis and genetics of
      inflammatory bowel disease have been accompanied by an escalation in the
      sophistication of immunomodulatory inflammatory bowel disease therapeutics.
      However, the basic 'triple' therapy (5-aminosalicylates, corticosteroids,
      azathioprine) and nutrition have maintained their central role in the management 
      of patients with inflammatory bowel disease over recent decades. This review
      provides an overview of the supportive and therapeutic perspectives of nutrition 
      in adult inflammatory bowel disease. The objective of supportive nutrition is to 
      correct malnutrition in terms of calorie intake or specific macro- or
      micronutrients. Of particular clinical relevance is deficiency in calcium,
      vitamin D, folate, vitamin B12 and zinc. There is justifiably a growing sense of 
      unease amongst clinicians and patients with regard to the long-term use of
      corticosteroids in inflammatory bowel disease. This, rather than arguments about 
      efficacy, should be the catalyst for revisiting the use of enteral nutrition as
      primary treatment in Crohn's disease. Treatment failure is usually related to a
      failure to comply with enteral nutrition. Potential factors that militate against
      successful completion of enteral nutrition are feed palatability, inability to
      stay on a solid-free diet for weeks, social inconvenience and transient
      feed-related adverse reactions. Actions that can be taken to improve treatment
      outcome include the provision of good support from dietitians and clinicians for 
      the duration of treatment and the subsequent 'weaning' period. There is evidence 
      to support a gradual return to a normal diet through exclusion-re-introduction or
      other dietary regimen following the completion of enteral nutrition to increase
      remission rates. We also review the evidence for emerging therapies, such as
      glutamine, growth factors and short-chain fatty acids. The future may see the
      evolution of enteral nutrition into an important therapeutic strategy, and the
      design of a 'Crohn's disease-specific formulation' that is individually tailored,
      acceptable to patients, cost-effective, free from adverse side-effects and
      combines enteral nutrition with novel pre- and pro-biotics and other factors.

TI  - Dietary fat attenuates the benefits of an elemental diet in active Crohn's
      disease: a randomized, controlled trial.
PG  - 151-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although an elemental diet has been established as the primary
      treatment for patients with Crohn's disease, the influence of dietary fat on the 
      elemental diet remains unclear. We have designed the first randomized, controlled
      trial for elemental diets containing different fat percentages in patients with
      active Crohn's disease. METHODS: Each patient was randomized to receive one of
      three dose levels of fat in an elemental diet (Elental) for 4 weeks: 10 patients 
      received low fat (3.06 g/day), 10 patients received medium fat (16.56 g/day) and 
      eight patients received high fat (30.06 g/day). The additional fat was composed
      of long-chain fatty acids. All patients were evaluated using the International
      Organization of Inflammatory Bowel Disease rating, plus C-reactive protein level 
      and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which were measured at weekly intervals.
      RESULTS: Although the International Organization of Inflammatory Bowel Disease
      rating, C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate in the
      low-fat group decreased, the values in the medium- and high-fat groups fluctuated
      during the study. The remission rate after 4 weeks in each group was 80%, 40% and
      25% for patients in the low-, medium- and high-fat groups, respectively.
      CONCLUSIONS: When the fat consisted of long-chain triglycerides, a high amount of
      this fat in the elemental diet formula decreased its therapeutic effect against
      active Crohn's disease.

TI  - Enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease: fat in the formula.
PG  - 115-8
AB  - Enteral nutrition is effective in inducing remission in active Crohn's disease.
      Speculation on the underlying mechanism of action has moved away from the
      presentation of nitrogen and towards the fat content of the various enteral
      feeds. Evidence is accumulating that additional long-chain triglyceride in such
      feeds impairs the response rate in active Crohn's disease, whereas no deleterious
      effects of additional medium-chain triglyceride have been identified. It has been
      proposed that long-chain triglycerides composed from n-6 fatty acids may be the
      most harmful, since such fatty acids are substrates for inflammatory eicosanoid
      production. However, recent studies comparing different enteral feeds are not
      consistent in identifying which additional fatty acids impair response rates to
      the greatest extent. Despite meta-analyses concluding that polymeric diets
      (typically containing large amounts of fat) are as effective as elemental diets, 
      it would seem sensible to use enteral feeds with minimal fat content when
      treating active Crohn's disease.

TI  - [Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) -- critical discussion of etiology,
      pathogenesis, diagnostics, and therapy].
PG  - 1-8
AB  - AIMS: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the most frequent inflammatory
      bowel diseases (IBD) with a prevalence of approximately one out of 500. Cytokine 
      research opened new and potent treatment options and thus stimulated clinical and
      basic research.However, the IBD still remain a challenge for patients and
      physicians,demanding close cooperation between gastroenterologists,radiologists
      and surgeons. The basic understanding of IBD,which is necessary for efficient
      diagnostic and therapeutic concepts is reviewed. METHODS: Based upon recent
      publications and our clinical experience we discuss aspects of
      etiology,pathogenesis,diagnostics,and therapy of Crohn's disease and ulcerative
      colitis. RESULTS: A genetically influenced, exaggerated and sustained immune
      response against the own gut flora seems to be one of the most important factors 
      in the pathogenesis of IBD. Not less important are environmental influences. For 
      instance, cigarette smoking had been judged to have some negative influence on
      the natural course of Crohn's disease.Now,however, recent studies show that
      smoking is even a significant independent risk factor in the pathogenesis of IBD.
      Since IBD and especially Crohn's disease can effect the whole body, detailed
      analysis of inflammatory organ involvement is necessary before therapy. For
      instance, the MRI enteroclysis technique adds a necessary diagnostic tool for the
      exploration of those parts of the small bowel that cannot been reached by routine
      endoscopy like the upper ileum and the lower jejunum. In terms of therapy, a
      change of paradigms can be observed: patients will no longer be treated only when
      symptoms arise, but will early be integrated into a therapeutic concept, which is
      determined by site and extent of the disease and adapted to the abilities and
      needs of the patient.Furthermore,immunosuppressive agents like azathioprine and
      6-mercaptopurine will establish as central concept in the medical treatment of
      IBD. DISCUSSION: IBD-therapy should rather be adapted to the patient's individual
      inflammatory pattern than be oriented to schematic treatment rules. New
      endoscopic and radiologic techniques provide the necessary diagnostic tools.

TI  - Safety and steroid-sparing experience using infliximab for Crohn's disease at a
      pediatric inflammatory bowel disease center.
PG  - 104-11
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The published experience using infliximab (Remicade, Centocor,
      Malvern, PA) for the treatment of pediatric Crohn's disease is limited but
      suggests utility in the treatment of refractory disease. Experience using
      infliximab at a large pediatric center is reviewed. METHODS: A retrospective
      review of all infliximab infusions administered to patients with Crohn's disease 
      (CD) was undertaken. Data were obtained from database and pharmacy records. Chart
      review and interviews with physicians, patients, and families were used to obtain
      missing data. RESULTS: A total of 432 infusions were administered to 82 patients 
      (34 female and 48 male) with CD. The number of infusions each patient received
      ranged from one to 18, with a mean of 5.3 (SD 4.6) and median of 3. Of 33
      patients, 19 (57.6%) became independent and remained free of corticosteroids.
      There was a statistically significant difference in the steroid dose between 0
      and 4 wk and 0 and 8 wk. In all, 23 infusion reactions occurred (5.3%). Three
      patients developed herpes zoster, and one developed Listeria monocytogenes
      meningitis. No patients were documented to have delayed hypersensitivity
      reactions or malignancies. CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab is safe and effective for
      treating pediatric patients with CD. A steroid-sparing effect was demonstrated.
      The most common adverse reaction to infliximab was infusion reaction. These
      reactions did not preclude further use of the agent. Serious infections were seen
      in a small number of patients.

TI  - Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index: responsive to short-term change.
PG  - 83-9
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Despite documented feasibility, reliability, and validity, the
      Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) has yet to be demonstrated to be
      sensitive to change in the time frame of acute treatment trials. We evaluated
      short-term responsiveness and determined the minimal change in PCDAI score
      associated with a clinically meaningful improvement in disease activity. METHODS:
      Standardized effect size (SES) and standardized response mean (SRM) were
      calculated as measures of responsiveness among pediatric patients being treated
      for acute exacerbations of Crohn disease 1) in a regular clinical practice
      setting and 2) as part of a multicenter, randomized controlled trial (RCT).
      Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to determine the 
      minimal PCDAI score change associated with significant clinical improvement used 
      as the gold standard in 1) physician global assessment of change and in 2) change
      in adult Crohn disease activity index (CDAI). RESULTS: Among responders, the SES 
      and SRM of the PCDAI were 1.78 and 1.41 (95% CI: 0.89-1.92) and 2.10 and 1.95
      (95% CI: 1.70-2.20) in the clinical practice setting and RCT setting,
      respectively. The optimal minimal PCDAI change score associated with clinically
      significant change in physician global assessment was determined to be -12.5
      (sensitivity 83.3%, specificity 92.3%). In the RCT setting a change in PCDAI of
      -10 corresponded to a change in CDAI of not greater-than-or-equal 70 points.
      CONCLUSIONS: The PCDAI is responsive to improvement in disease activity in Crohn 
      disease patients over a short interval. As such, the PCDAI is an appropriate
      instrument to use in pediatric acute treatment trials.

TI  - Infusion reactions to infliximab in children and adolescents: frequency, outcome 
      and a predictive model.
PG  - 75-84
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease commonly affects children and adolescents, however
      the majority of research into the safety and efficacy of therapies for
      inflammatory bowel disease, including infliximab, has occurred only in adults.
      AIM: To determine the rate of reactions in children following infliximab
      infusions, and to identify variables that might be predictive of those reactions.
      METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all infliximab infusions
      performed at Columbus Children's Hospital from December 1998 through September
      2001. RESULTS: Fifty-seven children received 361 infusions. Three hundred and
      fifty-five of the 361 infusions (98.3%) were completed. Fifty children had 304
      repeat infusions. There were a total of 35 infusion related reactions. Female
      gender and the use of immunosuppressive medications for less than 4 months were
      risk factors for a reaction to infusion number 2. A reaction to infusion 2 and
      immunosuppressive use for less than 4 months were risk factors for infusion
      number 3. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of infusion reactions in children receiving
      infliximab is similar to that in adults. Female gender, immunosuppressive use for
