AB  - BACKGROUND: Genetic variation in the Laccase (multicopper oxidoreductase)
      domain-containing 1 (LACC1) gene has been shown to affect the risk of Crohn's
      disease, leprosy and, more recently, ulcerative colitis and juvenile idiopathic
      arthritis. LACC1 function appears to promote fatty-acid oxidation, with
      concomitant inflammasome activation, reactive oxygen species production, and
      anti-bacterial responses in macrophages. We sought to contribute to elucidating
      LACC1 biological function by extensive characterization of its expression in
      human tissues and cells, and through preliminary analyses of the regulatory
      mechanisms driving such expression. METHODS: We implemented Western blot,
      quantitative real-time PCR, immunofluorescence microscopy, and flow cytometry
      analyses to investigate fatty acid metabolism-immune nexus (FAMIN; the LACC1
      encoded protein) expression in subcellular compartments, cell lines and relevant 
      human tissues. Gene-set enrichment analyses were performed to initially
      investigate modulatory mechanisms of LACC1 expression. A small-interference RNA
      knockdown in vitro model system was used to study the effect of FAMIN depletion
      on peroxisome function. RESULTS: FAMIN expression was detected in
      macrophage-differentiated THP-1 cells and several human tissues, being highest in
      neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells
      among peripheral blood cells. Subcellular co-localization was exclusively
      confined to peroxisomes, with some additional positivity for organelle
      endomembrane structures. LACC1 co-expression signatures were enriched for genes
      involved in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) signaling
      pathways, and PPAR ligands downregulated FAMIN expression in in vitro model
      systems. CONCLUSION: FAMIN is a peroxisome-associated protein with primary
      role(s) in macrophages and other immune cells, where its metabolic functions may 
      be modulated by PPAR signaling events. However, the precise molecular mechanisms 
      through which FAMIN exerts its biological effects in immune cells remain to be
      elucidated.

AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: Compared with patients with other benign intestinal conditions,
      patients with CD are at increased risk of developing postoperative complications 
      following intestinal resection. We searched for useful tools for predicting
      postoperative complication in patients with CD by comparing the relationship
      between postoperative morbidity in these patients as measured by three different 
      scoring tools: general surgical risk (POSSUM score), disease activity (CDAI), and
      nutritional screening (nutritional prognostic index). METHODS: We performed a
      retrospective review of 50 patients with small bowel CD who underwent surgical
      resection and primary anastomosis between 1999 and 2014. RESULTS: This study
      enrolled 34 men and 16 women. The mean age was 38.4 years (range: 20-81 years).
      There was no postoperative mortality. The overall postoperative morbidity rate
      (33.7%) predicted by POSSUM was similar to the rate in the study patients
      (36.0%). Although POSSUM score predicted higher postoperative morbidity rates in 
      patients who underwent emergency surgery (estimated morbidity: 52.8%), the actual
      postoperative morbidity rate in the emergency surgery group (26.7%) was smaller
      than in the elective surgery group (40.0%). In addition, neither preoperative
      nutritional status nor POSSUM score was related to the severity of postoperative 
      complications. CDAI score was significantly related to the severity of
      postoperative complications (P=0.032). CONCLUSION: Based on the above results, a 
      high preoperative CDAI score can predict negative postoperative outcomes. We
      believe that disease activity should be controlled using various treatment
      modalities, such as enteral or total parenteral nutrition as well as medication, 
      before performing surgery in patients with CD.

      with Perianal Fistulas in Children: Retrospective, Multicenter Study.
PG  - 523-30
LID - 10.17219/acem/36417 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infliximab is a biological drug used for the treatment of Crohn's
      disease in children. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this retrospective study was the
      estimation of effectiveness and safety of infliximab in the treatment of Crohn's 
      disease with perianal fistulas in children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Analysis
      comprised 50 children with Crohn's disease with perianal fistulas aged 9 to 18
      years (16 girls and 34 boys) who failed to respond to conventional therapy. The
      children were divided into two groups: the first group contained 23 children with
      simple fistulas and the second - 27 children with complex fistulas. All children 
      were treated with infliximab, administered in the dose of 5 mg per kilogram of
      the body mass. In the induction phase infliximab was administered at weeks 0, 2
      and 6 and after clinical response in maintenance phase the drug was administered 
      every 8 weeks; together for 12 months. RESULTS: In 76% of children after
      induction therapy with infliximab and in 71.87% after maintenance therapy the
      complete closure of fistula occurred. During the first year after the treatment a
      recurrence of a fistula was observed in 30.43% of the children. In two children
      anaphylactic shock was observed during injection of infliximab. The remaining
      children tolerated the drug well. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment with infliximab was 
      effective in the majority of fistulazing Crohn's disease and caused the closure
      of perianal fistula which improved quality of life.

TI  - Northern Latitude but Not Season Is Associated with Increased Rates of
      Hospitalizations Related to Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Results of a Multi-Year
      Analysis of a National Cohort.
PG  - e0161523
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0161523 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There is growing evidence that the incidence and severity of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may be geographically and seasonally related.
      Why these associations are observed remains unclear. We assessed the impact of
      geographic location, season, and exposure to ultraviolet light on disease
      severity by measuring national hospital IBD-related discharge rates. METHODS:
      Utilizing the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), we identified all patients with 
      IBD-related discharges from 2001-2007. Patients were included if they were
      discharged from states above the 40th parallel (north) or at or below the 35th
      parallel (south); and their discharge fell within the winter (January, February, 
      and March) or summer (July, August, and September). Groups of patients were
      assessed comparing north to south within each season, and summer to winter within
      each region. UV index was recorded from the National Weather Service data and
      compared to monthly discharge rates. RESULTS: There was a consistent pattern of
      increased IBD-related hospitalization rates in northern states compared to
      southern states for both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Differences in
      IBD-related hospitalization rates by season, however, were not uniform across the
      years studied. UV index was significantly inversely associated although not
      proportional to discharge rates for both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In the US, there is a significant increased rate of IBD-related
      hospitalizations in the northern compared to southern states, which not fully
      explained by differences in UV exposure.

TI  - Nutritional perspectives of children with Crohn's disease: a single-centre cohort
      observation of disease activity, energy expenditure and dietary intake.
PG  - 1132-1137

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Children with Crohn's disease often demonstrate
      nutritional recovery during primary therapy at diagnosis, but long-term
      nutritional support is sometimes necessary. Evidence to inform best nutritional
      practice including energy and micronutrient requirements is limited. The
      principal objective of this study was to determine how energy expenditure and
      physical activity vary with disease activity over the first year following
      diagnosis. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Twenty children were studied at diagnosis with
      Crohn's disease and were followed up over 1 year while receiving treatment
      according to national guidelines. The majority of children (13) were treated with
      exclusive enteral nutrition. At study visits, height, weight, bioelectrical
      impedance, resting energy expenditure by indirect calorimetry, tri-axial
      accelerometer and blood investigations were performed alongside clinical
      assessment. RESULTS: There was no significant effect of disease activity on
      resting energy expenditure (REE). Physical activity was greater after primary
      therapy (Z=3.31, P<0.01). Median wPCDAI fell from 58 at diagnosis to 7.5 after
      primary therapy and was 7.5 at 1 year. Weight s.d.s increased from -1.67 to -0.86
      and lean index s.d.s increased from -2.93 to -1.64, although the increase was
      mostly in the first 2 months. Median height s.d.s was unchanged throughout this
      study. There was a significant association between dietary intake and weight gain
      (r=0.8 P<0.01) but not height gain. Persistent micronutrient deficits beyond
      diagnosis were seen for both iron and vitamin D. CONCLUSIONS: This study has
      demonstrated that REE does not change significantly through different phases of
      disease activity, but physical activity is low at diagnosis. Children with
      Crohn's disease should be screened for deficiencies of iron and vitamin D.

TI  - Phenotypic and Genotypic Characterisation of Inflammatory Bowel Disease
      Presenting Before the Age of 2 years.
PG  - 60-69
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjw118 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] presenting in early childhood is
      extremely rare. More recently, progress has been made to identify children with
      monogenic forms of IBD predominantly presenting very early in life. In this
      study, we describe the heterogeneous phenotypes and genotypes of patients with
      IBD presenting before the age of 2 years and establish phenotypic features
      associated with underlying monogenicity. METHODS: Phenotype data of 62 children
      with disease onset before the age of 2 years presenting over the past 20 years
      were reviewed. Children without previously established genetic diagnosis were
      prospectively recruited for next-generation sequencing. RESULTS: In all, 62
      patients [55% male] were identified. The median disease onset was 3 months of age
      (interquartile range [IQR]: 1 to 11). Conventional IBD classification only
      applied to 15 patients with Crohn's disease [CD]-like [24%] and three with
      ulcerative colitis [UC]-like [5%] phenotype; 44 patients [71%] were diagnosed
      with otherwise unclassifiable IBD. Patients frequently required parenteral
      nutrition [40%], extensive immunosuppression [31%], haematopoietic stem-cell
      transplantation [29%], and abdominal surgery [19%]. In 31% of patients,
      underlying monogenic diseases were established [EPCAM, IL10, IL10RA, IL10RB,
      FOXP3, LRBA, SKIV2L, TTC37, TTC7A]. Phenotypic features significantly more
      prevalent in monogenic IBD were: consanguinity, disease onset before the 6th
      month of life, stunting, extensive intestinal disease and histological evidence
      of epithelial abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: IBD in children with disease onset
      before the age of 2 years is frequently unclassifiable into Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis, particularly treatment resistant, and can be
      indistinguishable from monogenic diseases with IBD-like phenotype.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nutritional status is an important consideration in many
      pediatric clinical conditions. This paper aimed to examine and compare the
      nutritional status, represented by body cell mass (BCM), of children with cancer,
      Crohn's disease (CD), cystic fibrosis (CF) and anorexia nervosa (AN). METHODS:
      Anthropometry was measured and BCM was calculated from whole body potassium-40
      counting in 259 children being treated for clinical conditions (n = 66 cancer; n 
      = 59 AN; n = 75 CF; n = 59 CD) and 108 healthy children. BCM was adjusted for
      height (BCMI) and expressed as a Z-score relative to laboratory reference data.
      RESULTS: The CD (-0.80 +/- 1.61; p = 0.0001) and AN (-1.13 +/- 0.99; p = 0.0001) 
      groups had significantly lower BMI Z-score than the healthy control (0.13 +/-
      0.75), cancer (0.50 +/- 1.40) and CF groups (-0.09 +/- 0.95). The cancer (-1.16
      +/- 1.60; p = 0.0001), CD (-1.13 +/- 1.36; p = 0.0001) and AN (-0.97 +/- 1.18; p 
      = 0.0001) groups had significantly reduced BCM compared to the healthy control
      (0.07 +/- 0.93) and CF group (0.31 +/- 1.08). According to BCMI Z-score, 42.4% of
      patients with cancer, 41.7% of the patients with CD, 27.1% of patients with AN,
      and 4.0% of patients with CF were considered malnourished. CONCLUSIONS: This
      study demonstrates that children undergoing treatment for clinical conditions may
      have alterations in BCM, independent of BMI. Children with cancer, CD and AN all 
      had a high prevalence of malnutrition. Assessment of body composition, not just
      body size, is vital to understand nutritional status in children with clinical
      conditions.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Immune-mediated angiogenesis may play an important role in the
      pathogenesis of inflammatory lesions in Crohn's disease (CD). The study aimed to 
      assess the influence of anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy on the
      angiogenesis in relation to microscopic and endoscopic healing in CD patients.
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Colonic tissue samples from 17 CD patients were taken
      during colonoscopy before and after anti-TNF therapy. Endoscopic and microscopic 
      severities were estimated using validated scores. Immunohistochemical expression 
      of CD31 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were assessed in parallel. 
      RESULTS: The expression of CD31 and VEGF decreased significantly after the
      anti-TNF therapy in parallel to endoscopic improvement; however, the microscopic 
      activity did not change significantly. There was a correlation between the change
      in CD31 and VEGF expression (p = 0.01; r = 0.6), as well as endoscopic healing (p
      = 0.04; r = 0.4). CD31 immunoexpression correlated with the number of poly- and
      mononuclear cells in the infiltrates in the mucosal lamina propria before the
      therapy (p = 0.02; r = 0.5). CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that modulation of vascular 
      proliferation can be a novel option to increase the efficacy of biological
      therapy in CD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment for an intra-abdominal abscess/infection
      secondary to perforating ileocolic Crohn's disease (PCD) is unclear. METHODS:
      Forty-seven consecutive PCD patients treated via an institutional protocol of
      ileocolectomy after a 7-day period of percutaneous abscess drainage were
      retrospectively compared with 160 consecutive patients who underwent an elective 
      ileocolectomy for Crohn's disease (ECD) between 1992 and 2014. Outcomes were
      compared using univariate analysis and propensity score matching. RESULTS:
      Univariate analysis demonstrated significant differences in ileostomy rates (PCD:
      48.9% vs ECD: 18.8%; P = .001), 30-day readmissions (PCD: 38.3% vs ECD: 18.8%; P 
      = .01), and overall 30-day postoperative complications (PCD: 29.8% vs ECD: 15%; P
      = .03). After matching, a statistically significant difference was retained in
      ileostomy rates (P = .02) and 30-day readmissions (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: Early
      operative intervention after percutaneous drainage in perforating CD may be
      associated with a high incidence of diversions and readmissions.

AB  - Uroenteric fistulae can occur between any part of the urinary tract and the small
      and large bowel. Classification is generally based on the organ of origin in the 
      urinary tract and the termination of the fistula in the segment of the
      gastrointestinal tract. Surgery is often necessary. Congenital fistulae are rare,
      with most being acquired. Uroenteric fistulae most frequently occur in a setting 
      of inflammatory bowel disease. Imaging often helps in the diagnosis. Management
      of urinary fistulae includes adequate nutrition, diversion of the urinary tract, 
      diversion of the gastrointestinal tract, treatment of underling inflammatory
      process or malignancy, and surgery.

TI  - Surgical Treatment of Crohn Colitis Involving More Than 2 Colonic Segments:
      Long-Term Outcomes From a Single Institution.
PG  - e3793
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000003793 [doi]
AB  - The incidence of primary Crohn colitis is uncommon and surgical treatment has
      remained controversial, although most patients with Crohn colitis eventually
      require surgical intervention. This study aims to compare the operative outcomes 
      of patients who underwent segmental versus either total colectomy or total
      proctocolectomy for Crohn colitis and to assess potential risk factors associated
      with clinical and surgical recurrence-free survivals.This is a retrospective
      study of 116 patients who underwent primary surgery for Crohn colitis between
      August 1997 and July 2011. Patients were classified based on the type of surgery:
      segmental colectomy (SC group; n = 71) or either total colectomy or total
      proctocolectomy (TC group; n = 45).There were no significant differences in
      postoperative complications or the nutritional state between the SC and TC
      groups. Patients in TC group had a significantly higher clinical recurrence-free 
      survival (CRFS). Among the 54 patients with multisegmental Crohn colitis, the TC 
      group had a significantly increased CRFS and surgical recurrence-free survival
      (SRFS), compared with patients in the SC group (5-year CRFS: 82.0% +/- 5.8% vs
      22.2% +/- 13.9%, P = 0.001; 5-year SRFS: 88.1% +/- 5.0% vs 44.4% +/- 16.6%, P =
      0.001). By multivariate analysis of patients with multisegments involved, SC was 
      a risk factor for SRFS and CRFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.637, 95% confidence
      interval [CI] = 1.387-15.509, P = 0.013 and HR = 32.407, 95% CI = 2.873-365.583, 
      P = 0.005).TC patients have significantly increased CRFS and TC in patients with 
      multisegment involvement may affect improved SRFS and CRFS. Among patients with
      multisegmental Crohn colitis, SC is an independent risk factor for CRFS and SRFS.

AB  - Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, result from 
      the uncontrolled inflammation that occurs in genetically susceptible individuals 
      and the dysregulation of the innate and adaptive immune systems. The response of 
      these immune systems to luminal gut microbiota and their products results in
      altered intestinal permeability, loss of barrier function, and mucosal
      inflammation and ulceration. Animal models of experiment intestinal inflammation 
      have been developed that leverage the development of spontaneous inflammation in 
      certain mouse strains, e.g. Samp1/Yit mice, or induction of inflammation using
      gene-targeting e.g. IL-10 null mice, administration of exogenous agents e.g. DSS,
      or adoptive transfer of T-cells into immunodeficient mice, e.g. CD4(+) CD45Rb(Hi)
      T-cell transfer. Colitis induced by rectal instillation of the haptenizing agent,
      2,4,6 trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid, is one of the most commonly used and
      well-characterized models of Crohn's disease in humans.

TI  - Intestinal APCs of the endogenous nanomineral pathway fail to express PD-L1 in
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 26747
LID - 10.1038/srep26747 [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory condition most commonly affecting the
      ileum and colon. The aetiology of Crohn's disease is complex and may include
      defects in peptidoglycan recognition, and/or failures in the establishment of
      intestinal tolerance. We have recently described a novel constitutive endogenous 
      delivery system for the translocation of nanomineral-antigen-peptidoglycan (NAP) 
      conjugates to antigen presenting cells (APCs) in intestinal lymphoid patches. In 
      mice NAP conjugate delivery to APCs results in high surface expression of the
      immuno-modulatory molecule programmed death receptor ligand 1 (PD-L1). Here we
      report that NAP conjugate positive APCs in human ileal tissues from individuals
      with ulcerative colitis and intestinal carcinomas, also have high expression of
      PD-L1. However, NAP-conjugate positive APCs in intestinal tissue from patients
      with Crohn's disease show selective failure in PD-L1 expression. Therefore, in
      Crohn's disease intestinal antigen taken up by lymphoid patch APCs will be
      presented without PD-L1 induced tolerogenic signalling, perhaps initiating
      disease.

AB  - Deregulation of various components of the immune system has been reported in the 
      inflamed gut of Crohn's disease (CD) patients. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are
      novel innate effector lymphocytes which can rapidly respond to danger signals,
      from invading pathogens or tissue damage, to maintain homeostasis, especially
      along the mucosal surfaces. The purpose of this study is to compare composition
      of the intestinal ILCs subsets of CD patients with differential inflammatory
      conditions of the terminal ileum, which are marked by distinct histological
      appearances and mucosal profiles of cytokines. We observed alterations in the
      frequency of Lineage(-)CRTH2(-)CD45(+)NKp44(-)CD117(-)CD127(+)ILC subset in the
      inflamed terminal ileum.

AB  - Over the past 20 years, a growing amount of evidence supports the role of
      microbes and an imbalanced microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). While 
      many reviews have been written on the microbiota in IBD, few have considered how 
      they fulfil the Koch's postulates. In this review, we consider how the Koch's
      postulates might be modified so that they can be fulfilled for polymicrobial
      diseases, and we discuss the progress made to date in fulfilling them.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease, cancer and medication: Cancer risk in the Dutch
      population-based IBDSL cohort.
PG  - 1270-80
LID - 10.1002/ijc.30183 [doi]
AB  - The management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has changed since the
      mid-1990s (e.g., use of thiopurines/anti-TNFalpha agents, improved surveillance
      programs), possibly affecting cancer risk. To establish current cancer risk in
      IBD, updates are warranted from cohorts covering this time span, and detailed
      enough to study associations with phenotype and medication. We studied
      intestinal-, extra-intestinal- and overall cancer risk in the Dutch
      population-based IBDSL cohort. In total, 1,157 Crohn's disease (CD) and 1,644
      ulcerative colitis (UC) patients were diagnosed between 1991 and 2011, and
      followed until 2013. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for CD 
      and UC separately, as well as for gender-, phenotype-, disease duration-,
      diagnosis era- and medication groups. We found an increased risk for colorectal
      cancer in CD patients with colon involvement (SIR 2.97; 95% CI 1.08-6.46), but
      not in the total CD or UC population. In addition, CD patients were at increased 
      risk for hematologic- (2.41; 1.04-4.76), overall skin- (1.55; 1.06-2.19), skin
      squamous cell- (SCC; 3.83; 1.83-7.04) and overall cancer (1.28; 1.01-1.60),
      whereas UC patients had no increased risk for extra-intestinal- and overall
      cancer. Finally, in a medication analysis on CD and UC together, long-term
      immunosuppression exposure (>12 months) was associated with an increased risk for
      hematologic cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, SCC and overall cancer, and this
      increase was mainly attributed to thiopurines. IBD patients with long-term
      immunosuppression exposure can be considered as having a higher cancer risk, and 
      our data support the advice in recent IBD guidelines to consider skin cancer
      screening in these patients.

TI  - Enteral feeding reduces metabolic activity of the intestinal microbiome in
      Crohn's disease: an observational study.
PG  - 1052-6
LID - 10.1038/ejcn.2016.74 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Enteral feeding will induce remission in as many as 80-90%
      of compliant patients with active Crohn's disease (CD), but its method of action 
      remains uncertain. This study was designed to examine its effects on the colonic 
      microbiome. METHODS/SUBJECTS: Healthy volunteers and patients with CD followed a 
      regimen confined to enteral feeds alone for 1 or 2 weeks, respectively. Chemicals
      excreted on breath or in faeces were characterised at the start and at the end of
      the feeding period by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. RESULTS: One week of 
      feeding in healthy volunteers caused significant changes in stool colour and
      deterioration in breath odour, together with increased excretion of phenol and
      indoles on the breath. Feeding for 2 weeks in patients with CD produced
      significant improvements in symptoms and a decrease in the concentration of
      C-reactive protein. The faecal concentrations of microbial products, including
      short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and potentially toxic substances, including
      1-propanol, 1-butanol and the methyl and ethyl esters of SCFAs, showed
      significant falls. CONCLUSIONS: A significant change occurs in the production of 
      microbial metabolites after enteral feeding in both healthy volunteers and
      patients with CD. Many of those detected in CD are toxic and may feasibly lead to
      the immunological attack on the gut microbiota, which is characteristic of
      inflammatory bowel disease. The reduction in the production of such metabolites
      after enteral feeding may be the reason for its effectiveness in CD.

AB  - A 10 year old girl with diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss and fever of one
      month and a half of evolution. Analytical and sonographic findings raised the
      possibility of inflammatory bowel disease. Endoscopy and histology showed
      findings consistent with Crohn's disease. Treatment was initiated with mesalazine
      and exclusive enteral nutrition. Later corticosteroid treatment,
      immunosuppressive drugs and ursodeoxycholic acid were added due to cholestasis
      and persistent hypergammaglobulinemia. Magnetic resonance cholangiography and
      liver biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of concomitant primary sclerosing
      cholangitis. The association between Crohn's disease and primary sclerosing
      cholangitis is rare, predominantly in males between 20 and 40 years old and it
      presents a great clinical variability. The confirmation of the diagnosis requires
      magnetic resonance cholangiography or endoscopic retrograde
      cholangiopancreatography. The prognosis is poor and there is no treatment to slow
      the progression of the disease.

TI  - The arachidonic acid metabolite 11beta-ProstaglandinF2alpha controls intestinal
      epithelial healing: deficiency in patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 25203
LID - 10.1038/srep25203 [doi]
AB  - In healthy gut enteric glial cells (EGC) are essential to intestinal epithelial
      barrier (IEB) functions. In Crohn's Disease (CD), both EGC phenotype and IEB
      functions are altered, but putative involvement of EGC in CD pathogenesis remains
      unknown and study of human EGC are lacking. EGC isolated from CD and control
      patients showed similar expression of glial markers and EGC-derived soluble
      factors (IL6, TGF-beta, proEGF, GSH) but CD EGC failed to increase IEB resistance
      and healing. Lipid profiling showed that CD EGC produced decreased amounts of
      15-HETE, 18-HEPE, 15dPGJ2 and 11betaPGF2alpha as compared to healthy EGC. They
      also had reduced expression of the L-PGDS and AKR1C3 enzymes. Produced by healthy
      EGC, the 11betaPGF2 activated PPARgamma receptor of intestinal epithelial cells
      to induce cell spreading and IEB wound repair. In addition to this novel healing 
      mechanism our data show that CD EGC presented impaired ability to promote IEB
      functions through defect in L-PGDS-AKR1C3-11betaPGF2alpha dependent pathway.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The effect of adiposity on bone mass in the early phases of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children and adolescents is unclear. The aim 
      of this study was to determine the role of adiposity on bone mass in the first 3 
      y of diagnosis of IBD. The expected result is that increased adiposity will be
      associated with increased bone mass in both the controls and IBD subjects.
      METHODS: Height-adjusted bone mineral density (BMD) z-scores of 25 subjects, age 
      13.97 +/- 2.70 y, diagnosed with IBD for <4 y were compared to 24 controls, age
      13.65 +/- 2.60 y. Overweight was defined as BMI of >/=85th but <95th percentile, 
      and obesity as BMI >/=95th percentile. Severity of IBD was determined by the
      Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index and Lichtiger Colitis Activity Index.
      RESULTS: Before stratification by BMI criterion, height-adjusted BMD z-scores
      were not significantly lower in IBD subjects versus controls for both the femoral
      neck (-0.8 +/- 1.1 versus -0.06 +/- 1.1, P = 0.070) and lumbar vertebrae (-0.4
      +/- 1.2 versus 0.2 +/- 1.2, P = 0.086). Following stratification, height-adjusted
      BMD z-scores were significantly lower in the overweight/obese IBD subjects versus
      overweight/obese controls for femoral neck (-0.9 +/- 0.9 versus 0.3 +/- 1.3, P = 
      0.032); and non-significantly lower for the lumbar spine z-score (-0.4 +/- 1.6
      versus 0.5 +/- 1.3, P = 0.197). BMD z-score had no relationship with the duration
      of disease, steroid therapy, and the severity of disease. CONCLUSION: Adiposity
      was associated with reduced bone mass in the early phases of IBD, but with
      increased bone mass in the controls.

TI  - Treatment Options and Outcomes of Pediatric IBDU Compared with Other IBD
      Subtypes: A Retrospective Multicenter Study from the IBD Porto Group of ESPGHAN.
PG  - 1378-83
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000767 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease unclassified (IBDU) is the rarest IBD
      subtype with treatment based on extrapolation from ulcerative colitis (UC) and
      Crohn's disease (CD) studies. We compared IBDU treatment choices with other
      colonic IBDs and explored long-term outcomes. METHODS: This was a multicenter
      retrospective longitudinal study of 23 centers of pediatric IBD with isolated
      colitis, including a mild ileitis consistent with backwash. RESULTS: Of note, 797
      children (median age: 11.6 years, range: 2-18.4) were included: 250 with CD, 287 
      with UC, and 260 with IBDU (median follow-up: 2.8 [interquartile range: 1.6-4.2] 
      years). IBDU differed from UC with lower corticosteroid (154 [59%] versus 204
      [71%]; P = 0.004) and higher exclusive enteral nutrition use (26 [10%] versus 2
      [0.6%]; P < 0.0001). Compared to patients with CD, patients with IBDU received
      less exclusive enteral nutrition and immunomodulators (26 [10%] versus 93 [37%]; 
      P < 0.0001 and 67 [26%] versus 129 [52%]; P < 0.0001, respectively) but more
      aminosalicylates (228 [88%] versus 159 [64%]; P < 0.0001). Biological treatment
      was significantly higher in CD (82 [34%]) than in IBDU and UC (24 [12%] and 47
      [17%], respectively; P < 0.0001). At last follow-up, 135 (69%) patients with IBDU
      had remission/mild disease activity compared with 100 (46%; P < 0.0001) patients 
      with CD and 174 (64%; P = 0.3) patients with UC. Four (2%) of 194 patients with
      IBDU underwent surgery compared with 22 (8%) of 270 patients with UC (P = 0.009) 
      and 20 (8%) of 238 patients with CD (P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Children with IBDU 
      have a lower medication burden and lower surgery rates than other IBD subtypes.
      The disease course at follow-up is generally mild, supporting an initial trial
      with 5-ASA before using more aggressive therapies.

TI  - Timing of Last Preoperative Dose of Infliximab Does Not Increase Postoperative
      Complications in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients.
PG  - 2602-7
LID - 10.1007/s10620-016-4171-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The association between preoperative use of infliximab and
      postoperative complications in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is 
      a subject of continued debate. Results from studies examining an association
      between the timing of last preoperative dose of infliximab and postoperative
      complications remain inconsistent. AIMS: To assess whether timing of last dose of
      infliximab prior to surgery affects the rate of postoperative complications in
      patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Retrospective chart
      review of IBD patients who have undergone surgery while receiving therapy with
      infliximab was conducted. Forty-seven patients were included in the analysis.
      RESULTS: No significant association was found between timing of infliximab and
      the rate of postoperative complications. Age, gender, disease type, steroid use, 
      preoperative status, surgery type, or surgeon type was not associated with
      increased rate of postoperative complications. CONCLUSION: Timing of last dose of
      infliximab does not affect the rate of postoperative complications in patients
      with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Body composition estimation using skinfolds in children with and without health
      conditions affecting growth and body composition.
PG  - 108-120
LID - 10.3109/03014460.2016.1168867 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Body composition prediction equations using skinfolds are useful
      alternatives to advanced techniques, but their utility across diverse paediatric 
      populations is unknown. AIM: To evaluate published and new prediction equations
      across diverse samples of children with health conditions affecting growth and
      body composition. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Anthropometric and dual-energy X-ray
      absorptiometry (DXA) body composition measures were obtained in children with
      Down syndrome (n = 59), Crohn disease (n = 128), steroid-sensitive nephrotic
      syndrome (n = 67) and a healthy reference group (n = 835). Published body
      composition equations were evaluated. New equations were developed for ages 3-21 
      years using the healthy reference sample and validated in other groups and
      national survey data. RESULTS: Fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM) and percentage 
      body fat (%BF) from published equations were highly correlated with DXA-derived
      measures (r = 0.71-0.98), but with poor agreement (mean difference = 2.4 kg, -1.9
      kg and 6.3% for FM, FFM and %BF). New equations produced similar correlations (r 
      = 0.85-1.0) with improved agreement for the reference group (0.2 kg, 0.4 kg and
      0.0% for FM, FFM and %BF, respectively) and in sub-groups. CONCLUSIONS: New body 
      composition prediction equations show excellent agreement with DXA and improve
      body composition estimation in healthy children and those with selected
      conditions affecting growth.

TI  - Dairy Products, Dietary Calcium, and Risk of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Results 
      From a European Prospective Cohort Investigation.
PG  - 1403-11
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000798 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dairy products may be involved in the etiology of inflammatory bowel 
      disease by modulating gut microbiota and immune responses, but data from
      epidemiological studies examining this relationship are limited. We investigated 
      the association between prediagnostic intake of these foods and dietary calcium, 
      and the subsequent development of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis
      (UC). METHODS: In total, 401,326 participants were enrolled in the European
      Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort. At recruitment,
      consumption of total and specific dairy products (milk, yogurt, and cheese) and
      dietary calcium was measured using validated food frequency questionnaires. Cases
      developing incident CD (n = 110) or UC (n = 244) during follow-up were matched
      with 4 controls. Conditional logistic regression analyses were used to calculate 
      odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for total energy 
      intake and smoking. RESULTS: Compared with the lowest quartile, the ORs for the
      highest quartile of total dairy products and dietary calcium intake were 0.61
      (95% CI, 0.32-1.19, p trend = 0.19) and 0.63 (95% CI, 0.28-1.42, p trend = 0.23) 
      for CD, and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.50-1.30, p trend = 0.40) and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.49-1.34,
      p trend = 0.60) for UC, respectively. Compared with nonconsumers, individuals
      consuming milk had significantly reduced odds of CD (OR 0.30, 95% CI, 0.13-0.65) 
      and nonsignificantly reduced odds of UC (OR 0.85, 95% CI, 0.49-1.47).
      CONCLUSIONS: Milk consumption may be associated with a decreased risk of
      developing CD, although a clear dose-response relationship was not established.
      Further studies are warranted to confirm this possible protective effect.

TI  - A key requirement for CD300f in innate immune responses of eosinophils in
      colitis.
PG  - 172-183
LID - 10.1038/mi.2016.37 [doi]
AB  - Eosinophils are traditionally studied in the context of type 2 immune responses. 
      However, recent studies highlight key innate immune functions for eosinophils
      especially in colonic inflammation. Surprisingly, molecular pathways regulating
      innate immune activities of eosinophil are largely unknown. We have recently
      shown that the CD300f is highly expressed by colonic eosinophils. Nonetheless,
      the role of CD300f in governing innate immune eosinophil activities is
      ill-defined. RNA sequencing of 162 pediatric Crohn's disease patients revealed
      upregulation of multiple Cd300 family members, which correlated with the presence
      of severe ulcerations and inflammation. Increased expression of CD300 family
      receptors was also observed in active ulcerative colitis (UC) and in mice
      following induction of experimental colitis. Specifically, the expression of
      CD300f was dynamically regulated in monocytes and eosinophils. Dextran sodium
      sulfate (DSS)-treated Cd300f(-/-) mice exhibit attenuated disease activity and
      histopathology in comparison with DSS-treated wild type (WT). Decreased disease
      activity in Cd300f(-/-) mice was accompanied with reduced inflammatory cell
      infiltration and nearly abolished production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
      Monocyte depletion and chimeric bone marrow transfer experiments revealed a
      cell-specific requirement for CD300f in innate immune activation of eosinophils. 
      Collectively, we uncover a new pathway regulating innate immune activities of
      eosinophils, a finding with significant implications in eosinophil-associated
      gastrointestinal diseases.

AB  - Survey aims were to investigate the dietary concerns, beliefs and opinions of
      people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and differences between those with 
      Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). A cross-sectional postal
      questionnaire was sent to people with IBD who were booked into an adult IBD or
      Gastroenterology clinic over a 6-week period. There were 416 eligible people and 
      168 (40%) responded. Sixty-four (42%) people indicated that food affects their
      symptoms a lot or severely. Eighty (51%) respondents indicated that diet was
      important or extremely important in controlling symptoms. Significantly more
      people with CD reported meat, fatty foods, chocolate and salad as a trigger than 
      people with UC. Significantly more people with UC reported wheat as a trigger.
      More people with CD avoided meat and chocolate than UC. This survey highlights
      the importance of nutrition and diet to people with IBD. Frequent food avoidance 
      was reported. This may impact on nutrition-related health problems.

TI  - The prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome-type symptoms in paediatric
      inflammatory bowel disease, and the relationship with biochemical markers of
      disease activity.
PG  - 181-8
LID - 10.1111/apt.13636 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A large proportion (25-46%) of adults with inflammatory bowel disease
      in remission has symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which are thought to
      reflect ongoing inflammation. Data on paediatric inflammatory bowel disease
      patients are lacking. AIM: To investigate (i) the prevalence of IBS-type symptoms
      in paediatric inflammatory bowel disease patients in remission and (ii) the
      relationship of IBS-type symptoms with biochemical markers of disease activity.
      METHODS: This cross-sectional study included all patients (<18 years) with
      Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis attending the out-patient clinic of one of 
      three Dutch hospitals between March 2014 and June 2015. Clinical disease activity
      was determined using the abbreviated-PCDAI or PUCAI. Biochemical disease activity
      was assessed using faecal calprotectin and serum CRP. IBS-symptoms were assessed 
      using physician-administered Rome III-questionnaires. RESULTS: We included 184
      patients (92 female; mean age: 14.5 years) (Crohn's disease: 123, ulcerative
      colitis: 61). The prevalence of IBS-type symptoms in children with inflammatory
      bowel disease in clinical remission was 6.4% (95% CI: 2.5-11.1%; Crohn's disease:
      4.5%; ulcerative colitis: 10.8%). Prevalence of IBS-type symptoms in children
      with faecal calprotectin <250 mug/g was 16.1% (95% CI: 7.6-25.8%; Crohn's
      disease: 16.7%; ulcerative colitis: 10.8%). No difference in faecal calprotectin 
      or CRP was found between patients in clinical remission with or without IBS-type 
      symptoms (faecal calprotectin: IBS+ median 58 mug/g, IBS- 221 mug/g, P = 0.12;
      CRP: IBS+ median 1.4 mg/L, IBS- 1.1 mg/L, P = 0.63). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence 
      of IBS-type symptoms in children with inflammatory bowel disease is highly
      dependent on the definition of remission. Nonetheless, the prevalence is much
      lower than that previously reported in studies in adult inflammatory bowel
      disease patients. IBS-type symptoms appear to be unrelated to gastrointestinal
      inflammation.

      improve absorption in patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS) are performed
      infrequently, and patient selection remains controversial. Our aim was to
      evaluate patient selection and outcome for RS in SBS patients. METHODS: Sixteen
      adult patients underwent RS among 520 SBS patients. All patients had remnant
      length >80 cm and rapid intestinal transit. Ten patients had a colon remnant and 
      12 had an ostomy. SBS was present for 8 to 150 months prior to RS. RESULTS: RS
      was performed either alone (n = 9) or concurrently with ostomy closure (n = 5) or
      creation (n = 2). There were 3 postoperative complications and no deaths. Three
      patients had bacterial overgrowth. One required repair of an ileocolonic
      stricture. Two reversed segments were taken down 12 months and 96 months later.
      Two patients subsequently underwent serial transverse enteroplasty (STEP)
      procedures, and 1 had isolated intestinal transplant. Fourteen (88%) required
      parenteral nutrition (PN) pre-operatively and 2 (12%) had intractable diarrhea.
      Nine (56%) patients improved and 7 (44%) remained on PN or had persistent
      intractable diarrhea. Patients with a successful outcome were similar to those
      without improvement with respect to ostomy takedown, duration of SBS, Crohn's
      disease, intestinal length, a colon remnant, anatomy, and transit time.
      CONCLUSIONS: Reversed segments significantly benefit one half of selected SBS
      patients who have rapid transit but adequate remnant length. Outcome in
      individual patients remains difficult to predict. Subsequent operation is
      frequently required. This procedure is applicable to a small proportion of SBS
      patients.

AB  - Postoperative Crohn's disease recurrence remains common, and preventing
      additional surgery remains a challenge. A critical step to postoperative
      management of Crohn's disease is being able to identify patients who should
      receive immediate postoperative therapy from the patients who can wait for
      recurrence prior to starting medications. All patients, regardless of their risk 
      for recurrence, are advised to undergo a colonoscopy at 6 to 12 months after
      surgery to evaluate for endoscopic evidence of Crohn's disease. Further
      management of patients depends on symptoms and the presence or absence of
      endoscopic recurrence.

TI  - Interobserver Variation Study of the Rutgeerts Score to Assess Endoscopic
      Recurrence after Surgery for Crohn's Disease.
PG  - 1001-5
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjw082 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: After resection surgery for Crohn's disease, recurrence of endoscopic
      lesions at the site of the anastomosis or in the neoterminal ileum is graded
      according to the Rutgeerts score (RS). The goal of this study was to test the
      interobserver variability for RS. METHODS: Thirteen trained endoscopists
      evaluated the RS on 39 videotapes of patients who had undergone resection for
      Crohn's disease with an ileocolonic anastomosis 6 months earlier. Videotapes were
      randomly assigned to endoscopists through a balanced incomplete block design.
      Each videotape was scored independently by four endoscopists, and each
      endoscopist evaluated 12 videotapes, making a total of 156 videotape assessments.
      Reproducibility levels of the RS were assessed through unweighted kappa estimates
      among multiple raters. The proportion of inappropriate therapeutic initiation was
      estimated by randomly selecting one endoscopist for each videorecording, assuming
      that the majority of endoscopists correctly classified endoscopic recurrence.
      RESULTS: The kappa estimates were 0.43 (95% confidence interval: 0.33-0.52) for
      the RS on a 5-grade scale, 0.47 (0.28-0.66) for RS < i2 vs. >/= i2, and 0.64
      (0.42-0.85) for RS </= i2 vs. > i2. The percentages of inappropriate therapeutic 
      initiation were 12.8% (3.8-21.9) when initiation was triggered by a RS >/= i2 and
      8.3% (1.1-15.6) when initiation was triggered by a RS > i2 (p = 0.41).
      CONCLUSION: The reproducibility of the RS was moderate, especially when
      differentiating <i2 from >/=i2, which may lead to incorrect therapeutic decisions
      in >10% of patients.

TI  - Genomic Alterations Observed in Colitis-Associated Cancers Are Distinct From
      Those Found in Sporadic Colorectal Cancers and Vary by Type of Inflammatory Bowel
      Disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's
      disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are at increased risk for small bowel
      or colorectal cancers (colitis-associated cancers [CACs]). We compared the
      spectrum of genomic alterations in CACs with those of sporadic colorectal cancers
      (CRCs) and investigated differences between CACs from patients with CD vs UC.
      METHODS: We studied tumor tissues from patients with CACs treated at Memorial
      Sloan Kettering Cancer Center or Weill Cornell Medical College from 2003 through 
      2015. We performed hybrid capture-based next-generation sequencing analysis of
      >300 cancer-related genes to comprehensively characterize genomic alterations.
      RESULTS: We performed genomic analyses of 47 CACs (from 29 patients with UC and
      18 with CD; 43 primary tumors and 4 metastases). Primary tumors developed in the 
      ileum (n = 2), right colon (n = 18), left colon (n = 6), and rectosigmoid or
      rectum (n = 21). We found genomic alterations in TP53, IDH1, and MYC to be
      significantly more frequent, and mutations in APC to be significantly less
      frequent, than those reported in sporadic CRCs by The Cancer Genome Atlas or
      Foundation Medicine. We identified genomic alterations that might be targeted by 
      a therapeutic agent in 17 of 47 (36%) CACs. These included the mutation encoding 
      IDH1 R132; amplification of FGFR1, FGFR2, and ERBB2; and mutations encoding BRAF 
      V600E and an EML4-ALK fusion protein. Alterations in IDH1 and APC were
      significantly more common in CACs from patients with CD than UC. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      an analysis of CACs from 47 patients, we found significant differences in the
      spectrum of genomic alterations in CACs compared with sporadic CRCs. We observed 
      a high frequency of IDH1 R132 mutations in patients with CD but not UC, as well
      as a high frequency of MYC amplification in CACs. Many genetic alterations
      observed in CACs could serve as therapeutic targets.

TI  - Serum Infliximab, Antidrug Antibodies, and Tumor Necrosis Factor Predict
      Sustained Response in Pediatric Crohn's Disease.
PG  - 1370-7
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000769 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serum infliximab (s-IFX) levels, antibodies to IFX (ATI), and
      inflammatory markers are important in predicting clinical outcomes in adults, but
      their roles in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) require further study. The primary 
      aim of this study was to determine the association between serologic parameters
      during induction and ongoing IFX therapy at 12 months in pediatric CD. METHODS:
      S-IFX, ATI, serum tumor necrosis factor alpha (s-TNF-alpha), and C-reactive
      protein were measured at IFX initiation, 10 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months in a
      prospective cohort study of children with CD at a single tertiary care center.
      RESULTS: At 12 months, 60 of 77 participants (78%) remained on IFX. Participants 
      who completed 12 months of IFX had higher 10-week median s-IFX levels (20.40
      mug/mL; interquartile range [IQR], 11.20-35.00] versus 8.70 mug/mL; IQR
      0.90-16.90; P = 0.01), a greater proportion with undetectable 10-week ATI (P =
      0.008), and a greater median change in s-TNF-alpha between baseline and week 10
      (-5.96 pg/mL; IQR, -8.73 to -4.17 versus -1.76 pg/mL; IQR, -5.60 to 0.30; P =
      0.006). Receiver operating characteristic analysis to predict ongoing IFX at 12
      months showed area under the curve (95% confidence interval) for 10-week s-IFX
      and change in s-TNF-alpha from baseline to 10 weeks to be 0.71 (0.54-0.88) and
      0.74 (0.58-0.91), respectively. C-reactive protein was not associated with
      ongoing therapy. CONCLUSIONS: ATI, s-IFX, and s-TNF-alpha during IFX induction
      are associated with 12-month clinical outcomes in pediatric CD. Future studies
      are needed to further define the clinical role of s-TNF-alpha measurement and to 
      compare the clinical utility of 10 and 14-week ATI and s-IFX levels.

TI  - [First combined intestinal and abdominal wall transplantation in the
      Netherlands].
PG  - A9788
AB  - BACKGROUND: When total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is not an option, intestinal
      transplantation is the sole treatment for patients with end-stage intestinal
      failure to increase the chance of long-term survival. However, in 20-33% of
      patients, abdominal wall-related complications occur after isolated intestinal
      transplantation. CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient is a 24-year-old woman with
      ultra-short bowel syndrome, caused by a severely complicated history of Crohn's
      disease. After 5 years of TPN, the patient was referred for intestinal
      transplantation. In addition, an abdominal wall transplant was required due to an
      abdominal wall defect, extensive scarring of the abdominal wall and lack of free 
      space within the abdomen. Therefore, a combined intestinal and abdominal wall
      transplantation was performed. Six months after transplantation the patient has a
      sufficient abdominal wall, a normal body mass index and no longer requires any
      feeding lines. CONCLUSION: This case report describes the first combined
      intestinal and abdominal wall transplantation in the Netherlands and in the
      Eurotransplant region in a patient with end-stage intestinal failure and loss of 
      abdominal domain.

TI  - Association Between Affective-Cognitive Symptoms of Depression and Exacerbation
      of Crohn's Disease.
PG  - 864-70
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2016.98 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of depression is high in patients with Crohn's disease
      (CD). We examined the influence of affective-cognitive symptoms of depression on 
      the risk of exacerbation of CD. METHODS: We studied 2,144 adult volunteers with a
      self-reported diagnosis of CD who completed a baseline survey that included
      demographics, CD status, and an affective-cognitive index of depression. Linear
      and logistic regression analyses were used to determine whether CD status at 12
      months was associated with the baseline measure of depression. Analyses were
      adjusted for confounders including age, gender, race, baseline disease activity, 
      disease duration, prior hospitalization and surgery, corticosteroid and anti-TNF 
      use, medication adherence, body mass index, current smoking, education, and sleep
      quality. RESULTS: Depression was significantly associated with subsequent
      increases in SCDAI score in both unadjusted (P<0.001) and adjusted (P<0.001)
      analyses. This association was non-linear, with a shallower slope for lower
      levels of depression. A 10-point increase in depression t-scores from 55 to 65
      was associated with a 18.6-point increase in SCDAI (95% CI 11.5-25.6) and an odds
      ratio of 1.27 for SCDAI>150 at follow-up (CI: 1.01-1.60). We also found a
      significant association between depressive symptoms and hospitalization.
      CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive-affective depressive symptoms were significantly
      associated with a risk of exacerbation of CD and hospitalization.

      with Disease Course in Patients with Ulcero-Constrictive Ileocolonic Disease.
PG  - e0152063
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0152063 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Association of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) 
      and Crohn's disease (CD) has been controversial due to contradictory reports.
      Therefore, we determined the prevalence of MAP in patients with CD and intestinal
      tuberculosis (ITB) and its association with clinical course. METHODOLOGY: Blood
      and intestinal biopsies were taken from 69 CD, 32 ITB patients and 41 patients
      with haemorrhoidal bleed who served as controls. qPCR targeting of MAP-specific
      IS900 gene was used to detect the presence of MAP DNA. qPCR results were further 
      validated by sequencing. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect the
      presence of MAP antigen in biopsy specimens. CD and ITB patients were followed-up
      for disease course and response to therapy. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The frequency of 
      MAP-specific DNA in biopsies by qPCR was significantly higher in CD patients
      (23.2%, p = 0.03) as compared to controls (7.3%). No significant difference in
      intestinal MAP presence was observed between ITB patients (12.5%, p = 0.6) and
      controls (7.3%). MAP presence in blood of CD patients was 10.1% as compared to
      4.9% in controls while no patients with ITB were found to be positive (p = 0.1). 
      Using IHC for detection of MAP antigen, the prevalence of MAP in CD was 2.9%,
      12.5% in ITB patients and 2.4% in controls. However, long-term follow-up of the
      patients revealed no significant associations between clinical characteristics
      and treatment outcomes with MAP positivity. CONCLUSION: We report significantly
      high prevalence of MAP in intestinal biopsies of CD patients. However, the
      presence of MAP does not affect the disease course and treatment outcomes in
      either CD or ITB patients.

AB  - Cheilitis granulomatosa is characterized by granulomatous lip swelling. We report
      a case of a 13-year-old girl who presented with orofacial swelling and
      arthralgia, who eventually was diagnosed with Crohn's disease, which was
      successfully treated with infliximab and azathioprine combination therapy.
      Recurrent or persistent orofacial swelling should prompt consideration of
      cheilitis granulomatosa, and further diagnostic evaluation to exclude the
      presence of Crohn's disease seems warranted.

AB  - CONTEXT: Smoking whose prevalence is higher in patients with Crohn's disease (CD)
      worsens its evolution. Ulcerative colitis mostly affect non- or ex-smokers;
      smoking may improve the course of the disease. OBJECTIVES: Systematic literature 
      review of data on the relationship between smoking, smoking cessation and
      Crohn'disease. DOCUMENTARY SOURCES: Medline, on the period 1980-2015 with the
      keywords "Crohn's disease" or "inflammatory bowel disease" and "smoking" or
      "smoking cessation"; limits "Title/Abstract"; the selected languages were English
      or French. STUDY SELECTION: Among 1315 articles, 168 abstracts have given rise to
      a dual reading to select 69 studies (case-control, retrospective, reviews or
      meta-analysis). Data were extracted using a reading gate. RESULTS: Smoking
      increases the risk of complications, recurrences and resort of surgery,
      corticosteroids or immunosuppressants. These deleterious effects are more common 
      in women. Stopping smoking improves the course of the disease and represents an
      essential component of its management. LIMITS: Heterogeneity of the studies
      collected according to the type, population characteristics, definition of
      smoking status and the validation of smoking cessation. CONCLUSION: Smokers
      suffering from CD must routinely be made aware of the disadvantages of smoking,
      benefits of abstinence and helped to quit smoking.

TI  - The Effect of anti-TNFalpha Induction Therapy on the Nutritional Status and
      Dietary Intake in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
PG  - 49-56
LID - 10.15403/jgld.2014.1121.251.tnf [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are
      at a high risk of malnutrition and retain an altered body composition. We
      hypothesized that anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) alpha therapy may improve
      dietary intake and have a beneficial influence on body composition in these
      patients. METHODS: Our study involved 40 IBD outpatients (33 Crohn's disease, 7
      ulcerative colitis); 24 of these received adalimumab (160/80/40EOW) and 16 were
      treated with infliximab (5 mg/kg at week 0, 2, 6, and subsequently every 8
      weeks). Body composition was measured with bioelectrical impedance analysis,
      while dietary intake was recorded prior to initiating biologicals and 3 months
      afterwards. Body composition indexes: fat-free mass index [FFMI], body fat mass
      index [BFMI]) were calculated in kg/m2. RESULTS: Baseline BMI (kg/m2) and muscle 
      parameters increased significantly at the end of the observational period (BMI:
      23.81+/-7.19 vs. 24.52+/-7.34, p<0.001; FFMI: 17.64+/-3.00 vs. 18.14+/-3.08,
      p<0.001; at week 0 vs. 12, respectively). However, no significant changes were
      detected in the fat parameters (BFMI: 6.21+/-5.20 vs. 6.44+/-5.27, respectively).
      We found no significant difference between the effects of adalimumab vs.
      infliximab on body composition (deltaFFMI: 0.55+/-0.82 vs. 0.43+/-0.69;
      deltaBFMI: 0.23+/-0.85 vs. 0.21+/-1.01, respectively). No significant difference 
      was observed in the extent of changes in parameters whether the patients were on 
      corticosteroids (n=15) or not (n=25) at week 0 (deltaFFMI: 0.44+/-0.84 vs
      0.59+/-0.72; deltaBFMI: 0.36+/-1.12 vs. 0.09+/-0.71, respectively). CONCLUSION:
      Our findings suggest that muscle parameters improved during the anti-TNF
      induction therapy, while fat parameters did not change significantly. Thus,
      induction anti-TNF therapy might have a beneficial effect on body composition.

AB  - Epigenetic and microbiome changes during pediatric development have been
      implicated as important elements in the developmental origins of inflammatory
      bowel diseases (IBDs) including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC),
      which are linked to early onset colorectal cancer (CRC). Colonic mucosal samples 
      from 22 control children between 3.5 and 17.5 years of age were studied by
      Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips and, in 10 cases, by 454 pyrosequencing of
      the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Intercalating age-specific DNA methylation and
      microbiome changes were identified, which may have significant translational
      relevance in the developmental origins of IBD and CRC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is evidence that anemia in Crohn's disease (CD) is a predictor 
      of disease severity. AIM: To evaluate if patterns of anemia over time showed
      correlation with aggressive disease trajectory, as characterized by change in
      Lemann Index (LI), which is a metric that quantifies bowel damage. METHODS: CD
      patients with 5 year (y) follow-up from a prospective registry were included. LI 
      was calculated from the first (LI1) and last (LI2) clinical encounters. The
      change in score (LI2-LI1) or the Delta LI (DLI) was recorded. Patterns of anemia,
      healthcare utilization and disease activity scores were analyzed. RESULTS: A
      total of 389 CD patients with 5y follow-up formed the study population [median
      age 40y (IQR: 31-53); 57.3% female; median disease duration 12y (IQR: 6-20.5),
      overall surgical exposure 69%]. Patients with anemia had significantly higher
      LI1, LI2, DLI and also significantly higher healthcare utilization and indices of
      disease activity, than patients without anemia (p<0.001). CD patients with anemia
      for any duration during the study had OR of 2.15 (95% CI 1.29-3.57, p=0.003) for 
      worsening bowel damage over the 5y. CONCLUSION: Based on a longitudinal analysis 
      of CD patients, anemia status over time shows significant correlation with
      increasing Lemann index and aggressive disease trajectory.

TI  - Up regulation of glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR) is
      associated with intestinal epithelial cells apoptosis in TNBS-induced
      experimental colitis.

AB  - Glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR), which exists mainly in
      the liver, is a D-2-hydroxy-acid dehydrogenase that plays a critical role in the 
      formation of primary hyperoxaluria type 2 (PH2). Here, we investigated GRHPR
      expression and its potential role in both human Crohn's disease (CD) and
      experimental colitis. Murine experimental colitis models were established by
      administration of trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS). As shown by Western blot,
      significant up-regulation of GRHPR was found in TNBS-treated mice as compared
      with normal controls. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) also showed increased GRHPR
      expression, and the molecule was located in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs).
      This phenomenon also occurred in patients with Crohn's disease. Besides, in an in
      vitro study, human IEC line HT-29 cells cultured with tumor necrosis factor alpha
      (TNF-alpha) were used to evaluate the changes in expression of GRHPR. Moreover,
      overexpression of GRHPR was accompanied by active caspase-3 and cleaved poly
      ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) accumulation. Furthermore, knock-down GRHPR could
      inhibit the accumulation of active caspase-3 and cleaved PARP as shown by Western
      blot in TNF-alpha treated HT-29 cells. Flow cytometry assay indicated that
      interference of GRHPR led to increasing apoptosis of IECs. These data suggested
      that GRHPR might exert its pro-apoptosis function in IECs. Thus, GRHPR might play
      an important role in regulating IECs apoptosis, and might be a potential
      therapeutic target for CD.

AB  - Differentiation between intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) and Crohn's disease (CD) is
      challenging in geographical regions where both these diseases are prevalent.
      There is a need of biomarkers for differentiation between these two disorders.
      Colonic biopsies from inflamed mucosa of treatment-naive patients with ITB, CD
      and controls were used for analysis. Protein extracted from biopsies was digested
      with trypsin and resulting peptides were labeled with iTRAQ reagents. The
      peptides were subsequently analyzed using LC-MS/MS for identification and
      quantification. Gene ontology annotation for proteins was analyzed in PANTHER.
      Validation experiments were done for six differentially expressed proteins using 
      immunohistochemistry. 533 proteins were identified and 241 proteins were
      quantified from 5 sets of iTRAQ experiments. While 63 were differentially
      expressed in colonic mucosa of patients with CD and ITB in at least one set of
      iTRAQ experiment, 11 proteins were differentially expressed in more than one set 
      of experiments. Six proteins used for validation using immunohistochemistry in a 
      larger cohort of patients; none of them however was differentially expressed in
      patients with ITB and CD. There are differentially expressed proteins in tissue
      proteome of CD and ITB. Further experiments are required using a larger cohort of
      homogeneous tissue samples.

TI  - Early Mucosal Healing with Exclusive Enteral Nutrition is Associated with
      Improved Outcomes in Newly Diagnosed Children with Luminal Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1159-64
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjw075 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Exclusive Enteral Nutrition (EEN) induction in children with luminal 
      Crohn's disease (CD) gives early mucosal healing (MH), but the long-term benefits
      of EEN-induced MH are just emerging. AIMS & METHODS: We prospectively followed an
      Australian cohort of newly diagnosed children with predominantly luminal CD who
      completed at least six weeks EEN and with paired clinical Pediatric Crohn's
      Disease Activity Index (PCDAI), biochemical (C-reactive protein; CRP) and
      endoscopic assessment at diagnosis and post EEN. All commenced immunomodulators
      (IMs) early (<3 months from diagnosis) and had a minimum of 1 year follow-up.
      Complete MH was a simple endoscopic score for Crohn's disease (SES-CD) of 0, and 
      SES-CD>/=1 was ascribed to active endoscopic disease (aED) and further divided
      into near complete MH (SES 1-3), mild active disease (SES-CD 4-10) and moderate
      to severe disease (SES-CD>10). The primary outcome was long-term supervised
      sustained remission (SR) on IMs alone without need for corticosteroids,
      infliximab (IFX) or surgery. RESULTS: A total of 54 eligible children (33 males) 
      completing EEN induction were analysed. The median duration between pre and post 
      EEN assessments was 60.5 days [interquartile range (IQR), 56-69.5]. Post EEN:
      clinical remission (PCDAI < 10) was observed in 45/54 (83%), and biochemical
      remission (PCDAI < 10 and CRP < 5 mg/dl) was observed in 39/54 (72%). Complete MH
      was observed in 18/54 (33%), near complete in 10/54(19%). SR was superior in
      those with complete MH vs. aED; 13/18, (72%) vs. 10/36 (28%), p = 0.003 at 1
      year, 8/16, (50%) vs. 3/24, (8%), p = 0.008 at 2 years and (8/16, (50%) vs. 1/19,
      (6%), p = 0.005) at 3 years. Near-complete MH did not lead to superior SR.
      CONCLUSIONS: Only complete MH post EEN induction predicts more favourable SR for 
      up to 3 years.

TI  - Clinical course and outcomes of diagnosing Inflammatory Bowel Disease in children
      10 years and under: retrospective cohort study from two tertiary centres in the
      United Kingdom and in Italy.
PG  - 35
LID - 10.1186/s12876-016-0455-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most children with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) are diagnosed
      between 11 and 16 years of age, commonly presenting with features of typical IBD.
      Children with onset of gut inflammation under 5 years of age often have a
      different underlying pathophysiology, one that is genetically and phenotypically 
      distinct from other children with IBD. We therefore set out to assess whether
      children diagnosed after the age of 5 years, but before the age of 11, have a
      different clinical presentation and outcome when compared to those presenting
      later. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study conducted at two European Paediatric
      Gastroenterology Units. Two cohorts of children with IBD (total number = 160)
      were compared: 80 children diagnosed between 5 and 10 years (Group A), versus 80 
      children diagnosed between 11 and 16 (Group B). Statistical analysis included
      multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Group A presented with a greater disease
      activity (p = 0.05 for Crohn's disease (CD), p = 0.03 for Ulcerative Colitis
      (UC); Odds Ratio 1.09, 95 % Confidence Interval: 1.02-1.1), and disease extent
      (L2 location more frequent amongst Group A children with CD (p = 0.05)). No
      significant differences were observed between age groups in terms of
      gastro-intestinal and extra-intestinal signs and symptoms at disease
      presentation, nor was there a difference in the number of hospitalisations due to
      relapsing IBD during follow-up. However, children in Group A were treated earlier
      with immunosuppressants and had more frequent endoscopic assessments. CONCLUSION:
      While clinicians feel children between 5 and 10 years of age have a more severe
      disease course than adolescents, our analysis also suggests a greater disease
      burden in this age group. Nevertheless, randomized trials to document longer-term
      clinical outcomes are urgently needed, in order to address the question whether a
      younger age at disease onset should prompt per se a more "aggressive" treatment. 
      We speculate that non-clinical factors (e.g. genetics, epigenetics) may have more
      potential to predict longer term outcome than simple clinical measures such as
      age at diagnosis.

AB  - We simultaneously investigated the genetic landscape of ankylosing spondylitis,
      Crohn's disease, psoriasis, primary sclerosing cholangitis and ulcerative colitis
      to investigate pleiotropy and the relationship between these clinically related
      diseases. Using high-density genotype data from more than 86,000 individuals of
      European ancestry, we identified 244 independent multidisease signals, including 
      27 new genome-wide significant susceptibility loci and 3 unreported shared risk
      loci. Complex pleiotropy was supported when contrasting multidisease signals with
      expression data sets from human, rat and mouse together with epigenetic and
      expressed enhancer profiles. The comorbidities among the five immune diseases
      were best explained by biological pleiotropy rather than heterogeneity (a
      subgroup of cases genetically identical to those with another disease, possibly
      owing to diagnostic misclassification, molecular subtypes or excessive
      comorbidity). In particular, the strong comorbidity between primary sclerosing
      cholangitis and inflammatory bowel disease is likely the result of a unique
      disease, which is genetically distinct from classical inflammatory bowel disease 
      phenotypes.

TI  - Time to Relapse in Children with Crohn's Disease Treated with Azathioprine and
      Nutritional Therapy or Corticosteroids.
PG  - 2041-50
LID - 10.1007/s10620-016-4103-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The duration of remission has been shown to be longer in patients
      initially treated with exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) compared to
      corticosteroids (CS). However, no published studies required concurrent
      immunomodulator [6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine (AZA)] use at the time of
      diagnosis. AIMS: The aims of this retrospective study were to compare the
      duration of remission between patients initially treated with AZA in combination 
      with CS or EEN and identify predictors of early relapse in these patients.
      METHODS: Data from 65 newly diagnosed children with CD in clinical remission on
      either EEN or CS and commencing AZA at diagnosis were included. We compared
      duration of remission using physician global assessment and carried out Cox
      regression analysis to identify predictors of early relapse. Patients were
      followed up to the time of first relapse or for at least 12 months. RESULTS:
      There were no differences in the duration of remission between patients initially
      treated with EEN or CS (p = 0.978). We identified younger age at diagnosis
      [hazard ratio (HR) 0.87, 95 CI 0.78-0.98, p = 0.016], lower height Z score at
      diagnosis (HR 0.61, 95 CI 0.44-0.85, p = 0.003), involvement of the upper
      gastrointestinal tract (HR 2.69, 95 CI 1.27-5.66, p = 0.009), and elevated
      platelet count at remission (HR 1.004, 95 CI 1.001-1.008, p = 0.021) as
      independent predictors of early relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Neither induction regime
      demonstrated longer duration of remission of CD in patients treated with
      immunomodulators since the time of diagnosis.

TI  - Impaired antibacterial autophagy links granulomatous intestinal inflammation in
      Niemann-Pick disease type C1 and XIAP deficiency with NOD2 variants in Crohn's
      disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C1 (NPC1), a lysosomal lipid
      storage disorder that causes neurodegeneration and liver damage, can present with
      IBD, but neither the significance nor the functional mechanism of this
      association is clear. We studied bacterial handling and antibacterial autophagy
      in patients with NPC1. DESIGN: We characterised intestinal inflammation in 14
      patients with NPC1 who developed IBD. We investigated bacterial handling and
      cytokine production of NPC1 monocytes or macrophages in vitro and compared
      NPC1-associated functional defects to those caused by IBD-associated
      nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) variants or
      mutations in X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP). RESULTS: Patients with the
      lysosomal lipid storage disorder NPC1 have increased susceptibility to
      early-onset fistulising colitis with granuloma formation, reminiscent of Crohn's 
      disease (CD). Mutations in NPC1 cause impaired autophagy due to defective
      autophagosome function that abolishes NOD2-mediated bacterial handling in vitro
      similar to variants in NOD2 or XIAP deficiency. In contrast to genetic NOD2 and
      XIAP variants, NPC1 mutations do not impair NOD2-receptor-interacting kinase 2
      (RIPK2)-XIAP-dependent cytokine production. Pharmacological activation of
      autophagy can rescue bacterial clearance in macrophages in vitro by increasing
      the autophagic flux and bypassing defects in NPC1. CONCLUSIONS: NPC1 confers
      increased risk of early-onset severe CD. Our data support the concept that
      genetic defects at different checkpoints of selective autophagy cause a shared
      outcome of CD-like immunopathology linking monogenic and polygenic forms of IBD. 
      Muramyl dipeptide-driven cytokine responses and antibacterial autophagy induction
      are parallel and independent signalling cascades downstream of the
      NOD2-RIPK2-XIAP complex.

TI  - Association of Vitamin D Level With Clinical Status in Inflammatory Bowel
      Disease: A 5-Year Longitudinal Study.
PG  - 712-9
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2016.53 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Emerging data suggest that vitamin D has a significant role in
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Prospective data evaluating the association of 
      vitamin D serum status and disease course are lacking. We sought to determine the
      relationship between vitamin D status and clinical course of IBD over a multiyear
      time period. METHODS: IBD patients with up to 5-year follow-up from a
      longitudinal IBD natural history registry were included. Patients were
      categorized according to their mean serum 25-OH vitamin D level. IBD clinical
      status was approximated with patterns of medication use, health-care utilization,
      biochemical markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate (ESR)), pain and clinical disease activity scores, and
      health-related quality of life. RESULTS: A total of 965 IBD patients (61.9%
      Crohn's disease, 38.1% ulcerative colitis) formed the study population (mean age 
      44 years, 52.3% female). Among them, 29.9% had low mean vitamin D levels. Over
      the 5-year study period, subjects with low mean vitamin D required significantly 
      more steroids, biologics, narcotics, computed tomography scans, emergency
      department visits, hospital admissions, and surgery compared with subjects with
      normal mean vitamin D levels (P<0.05). Moreover, subjects with low vitamin D
      levels had worse pain, disease activity scores, and quality of life (P<0.05).
      Finally, subjects who received vitamin D supplements had a significant reduction 
      in their health-care utilization. CONCLUSIONS: Low vitamin D levels are common in
      IBD patients and are associated with higher morbidity and disease severity,
      signifying the potential importance of vitamin D monitoring and treatment.

TI  - Demographic and Clinical Predictors of High Healthcare Use in Patients with
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
PG  - 1442-9
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000763 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a heterogeneous chronic
      inflammatory condition requiring significant healthcare expenditure. Subgroups of
      individuals contribute disproportionately to spending. We aimed to determine
      demographic and clinical factors predictive of high healthcare expenditures for
      IBD patients followed over a multiyear period. METHODS: This was a registry
      analysis using a prospective observational, consented, natural history registry
      from a tertiary IBD center and associated medical charges, not including pharmacy
      expenses. The 100 patients with the highest medical charges (top 5%) were
      compared with the median 300 patients. Logistic regression determined demographic
      and clinical factors associated with high charge patients. RESULTS: IBD patients 
      in the high charge group had significantly more unemployment (P < 0.0001), were
      of black race (P = 0.013), comorbid psychiatric illness (P = 0.002), hypertension
      (P = 0.01), diabetes (P = 0.004), opiate use (P < 0.0001), perianal involvement
      (P = 0.002), penetrating disease (P < 0.0001), and extensive colitis (P = 0.01). 
      In multivariate analysis, unemployment (Crohn's disease [CD]: odds ratio [OR],
      3.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.32-7.02; ulcerative colitis [UC]: OR, 2.68;
      95% CI, 1.20-5.99), psychiatric illness (UC: OR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.03-4.19),
      opiates (CD: OR, 5.61; 95% CI, 2.67-11.82; UC: OR, 5.14; 95% CI, 2.52-10.48),
      prior surgery (CD: OR, 3.29; 95% CI, 1.59-6.82; UC: OR, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.39-5.32),
      penetrating CD (OR, 3.29; 95% CI, 1.02-10.62), and corticosteroid requirement
      (CD: OR, 3.78; 95% CI, 1.86-7.65; UC: OR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.51-5.90) remained
      independently associated with high charges. CONCLUSIONS: High expenditure IBD
      patients were affected by more severe disease. The high prevalence of depression,
      anxiety, and chronic pain in these patients suggests the need for focused
      treatment of these comorbidities ultimately to reduce financial burden.

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of Escalation of Adalimumab Therapy to Weekly Dosing in
      Pediatric Patients with Crohn's Disease.
PG  - 886-93
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000715 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of adalimumab in inducing and maintaining remission in
      children with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease was shown in the
      IMAgINE 1 trial (NCT00409682). As per protocol, nonresponders or patients
      experiencing flare(s) on every other week (EOW) maintenance dosing could escalate
      to weekly dosing; we aimed to determine the therapeutic benefits of weekly dose
      escalation in this subpopulation. METHODS: Week 52 remission and response rates
      were assessed in patients who escalated to weekly dosing from their previous EOW 
      schedule, which was according to randomized treatment dose (higher dose [HD]
      adalimumab [>/=40 kg, 40 mg EOW; <40 kg, 20 mg EOW] or lower dose [LD; >/=40 kg, 
      20 mg EOW; <40 kg, 10 mg EOW]). Adverse events were reported for patients
      remaining on EOW dosing and patients receiving weekly dosing. RESULTS: Escalation
      to weekly dosing occurred in 48/95 (50.5%) patients randomized to LD and 35/93
      (37.6%) patients randomized to HD adalimumab (P = 0.076). Week 52 remission and
      response rates were 18.8% and 47.9% for patients receiving LD adalimumab weekly
      and 31.4% and 57.1% for patients receiving HD adalimumab weekly, respectively (LD
      versus HD, P = 0.19 for remission; P = 0.41 for response). Adverse event rates
      were similar for patients receiving EOW and weekly adalimumab. CONCLUSIONS:
      Weekly adalimumab dosing was clinically beneficial for children with Crohn's
      disease who experienced nonresponse or flare on EOW dosing. No increased safety
      risks were observed with weekly dosing.

TI  - Towards an integrated understanding of the therapeutic utility of exclusive
      enteral nutrition in the treatment of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1741-51
LID - 10.1039/c5fo01196e [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic disease characterized by episodic and disabling
      inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract in genetically susceptible
      individuals. The incidence and prevalence of CD is rising rapidly across the
      world emphasising that disease risk is also influenced by environmental and
      lifestyle factors, as well as the microbial community resident in the gut.
      Childhood-onset CD is associated with an aggressive disease course that can
      adversely impact patient growth and development. There is no cure for CD however 
      new onset and recurrent cases of paediatric CD are often responsive to exclusive 
      enteral nutrition (EEN) treatment. EEN treatment involves the exclusive
      consumption of an elemental or polymeric formula for several weeks and it is well
      established as a primary intervention strategy. EEN treatments typically achieve 
      remission rates of over 80% and importantly they are associated with a high rate 
      of mucosal healing, far superior to steroids, which is prognostic of improved
      long-term health outcomes. Furthermore, they are safe, have few side effects, and
      improve nutritional status and linear growth. Surprisingly, despite the utility
      of EEN our understanding of the host-microbe-diet interactions that underpin
      clinical remission and mucosal healing are limited. Here, we review the current
      state of knowledge and propose that the induction of autophagy, in addition to
      modulation of the microbiota and coordinated effects on inflammation and
      epithelial cell biology, may be critical for the therapeutic effects associated
      with EEN. A better understanding of EEN treatment will provide new opportunities 
      to restore gut homeostasis and prolong periods of remission, as well as provide
      new insights into the factors that trigger and perhaps prevent CD.

TI  - NOD2 gene variant is a risk factor for postoperative complications in patients
      with Crohn's disease: A genetic association study.

LID - S0039-6060(16)00061-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.surg.2016.01.013 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postoperative complications are relatively frequent in Crohn's
      disease (CD) and several risk factors have been identified. The influence of
      genetic factors, however is unknown. METHODS: CD patients who underwent
      CD-related bowel resection were identified from the "Nancy IBD cohort."
      Postoperative complications were defined as intraabdominal infectious
      complications and non-intraabdominal infectious complications occurring within 90
      days after operation. The influence of 203 single nucleotide polymorphisms on
      postoperative complication rates was analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 137 patients who
      had undergone a CD-related bowel resection in our cohort, postoperative
      complications occurred in 34 cases (24.8%). Postoperative intraabdominal
      infections occurred in 18 cases (13.1%): 12 had anastomotic leakage and 6 had
      intraabdominal abscesses. In multivariate analysis, current smoker status (odds
      ratio [OR], 2.71; 95% CI, 1.18-6.21; P = .02) and homozygosity for the risk
      allele (T) Nucleotide-binding Oligomerization Domain-containing protein 2
      (rs5743289; NOD2; OR, 2.07 [95% CI 1.15-3.72]; P = .01) were independent risk
      factors of postoperative intraabdominal infectious complications. Current smoker 
      status NOD2 homozygosity for the risk allele (T) were not associated with
      non-intraabdominal infectious complications. CONCLUSION: Current smoker status
      was associated with increased risk of postoperative intraabdominal infectious
      complications. A novel association between the NOD2 allele and an increased risk 
      of postoperative intraabdominal infectious complications was observed in this
      study.

TI  - Infliximab Reduces Endoscopic, but Not Clinical, Recurrence of Crohn's Disease
      After Ileocolonic Resection.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Most patients with Crohn's disease (CD) eventually require an 
      intestinal resection. However, CD frequently recurs after resection. We performed
      a randomized trial to compare the ability of infliximab vs placebo to prevent CD 
      recurrence. METHODS: We evaluated the efficacy of infliximab in preventing
      postoperative recurrence of CD in 297 patients at 104 sites worldwide from
      November 2010 through May 2012. All study patients had undergone ileocolonic
      resection within 45 days before randomization. Patients were randomly assigned
      (1:1) to groups given infliximab (5 mg/kg) or placebo every 8 weeks for 200
      weeks. The primary end point was clinical recurrence, defined as a composite
      outcome consisting of a CD Activity Index score >200 and a >/=70-point increase
      from baseline, and endoscopic recurrence (Rutgeerts score >/=i2, determined by a 
      central reader) or development of a new or re-draining fistula or abscess, before
      or at week 76. Endoscopic recurrence was a major secondary end point. RESULTS: A 
      smaller proportion of patients in the infliximab group had a clinical recurrence 
      before or at week 76 compared with the placebo group, but this difference was not
      statistically significant (12.9% vs 20.0%; absolute risk reduction [ARR] with
      infliximab, 7.1%; 95% confidence interval: -1.3% to 15.5%; P = .097). A
      significantly smaller proportion of patients in the infliximab group had
      endoscopic recurrence compared with the placebo group (30.6% vs 60.0%; ARR with
      infliximab, 29.4%; 95% confidence interval: 18.6% to 40.2%; P < .001).
      Additionally, a significantly smaller proportion of patients in the infliximab
      group had endoscopic recurrence based only on Rutgeerts scores >/=i2 (22.4% vs
      51.3%; ARR with infliximab, 28.9%; 95% confidence interval: 18.4% to 39.4%; P <
      .001). Patients previously treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor agents or
      those with more than 1 resection were at greater risk for clinical recurrence.
      The safety profile of infliximab was similar to that from previous reports.
      CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab is not superior to placebo in preventing clinical
      recurrence after CD-related resection. However, infliximab does reduce endoscopic
      recurrence. ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT01190839.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The impact of infliximab (IFX) on surgical outcomes is poorly defined
      in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). We evaluated our institution's experience with
      IFX on postoperative complications and surgical recurrence. METHODS: A
      retrospective review of children who underwent intestinal resection with primary 
      anastomosis for CD from 1/2002 to 10/2014 was performed. Data collected included 
      IFX use and surgical outcomes. Preoperative IFX use was within 3months of
      surgery. RESULTS: Seventy-three patients were included with median age 15years
      (range: 9-18). The most frequent indications for operation were obstruction
      (n=26) and fistulae (n=19). Nine patients (13%) had a surgical recurrence at a
      median of 2.3years (IQR 0.7-3.5). Twenty-two patients received preoperative IFX
      at median of 26days (IQR 14-46). There were 7 postoperative complications: 2
      bowel obstructions, and 5 superficial wound infections. Outcomes of patients
      stratified by IFX were not different. When stratified by indication, refractory
      disease was associated with higher preoperative IFX use (IFX use 55% vs. no IFX
      use 28%, p=0.027). No specific indication was associated with increased
      reoperation rates. CONCLUSION: Pediatric CD patients treated with preoperative
      IFX undergo intestinal resection with primary anastomosis with acceptable
      morbidity. The heterogeneous approach to medical management underscores the need 
      for guidelines to direct treatment.

TI  - Epidemiology and Long-term Outcome of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Diagnosed at
      Elderly Age-An Increasing Distinct Entity?
PG  - 1425-34
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000738 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Elderly onset (EO) inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may become a more
      common entity as a result of population aging and the rising IBD incidence. Its
      management is challenging, because of multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and frailty. 
      Insight into the long-term outcome is essential for optimal patient counseling
      and treatment. We studied the incidence and disease outcome of elderly-onset IBD 
      in direct comparison to adult-onset (AO) IBD. METHODS: All 2823 cases with IBD
      from the Dutch population-based IBD South Limburg cohort, diagnosed between 1991 
      and 2011, were included. Long-term outcome (hospitalization, surgery, and disease
      phenotype) was compared between AO (<60 years at diagnosis) and EO (>/=60 years
      at diagnosis) disease, for Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)
      separately. RESULTS: In total, 1162 patients with CD (136 EO/1026 AO) and 1661
      patients with UC (373 EO/1288 AO) were included. The EO IBD incidence increased
      from 11.71 per 100,000 persons in 1991 to 23.66 per 100,000 persons in 2010, P < 
      0.01. Immunomodulators were less often used in EO CD (61.8% versus 77.1%, P =
      0.03) and EO UC (22.8% versus 35.4%, P < 0.01), even as biologicals (25.1% versus
      55.1%, P = 0.03 and 7.8% versus 18.0%, P < 0.01, respectively). No differences
      were observed in surgery risk (CD: hazard ratio [HR] 1.19; 95% confidence
      interval [CI], 0.85-1.67 and UC: HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.53-1.46), or in CD phenotype
      progression (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.52-1.25), but more patients with EO UC required 
      hospitalization (HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.01-1.63). CONCLUSIONS: EO IBD is rising,
      warranting physicians' alertness for IBD in elderly patients. The long-term
      outcome was not different from AO disease, despite a less frequent use of
      immunomodulators and biologicals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies describing the incidence of Crohn's disease (CD) and
      ulcerative colitis (UC) are uncommon in the United States. We sought to determine
      the incidence of CD and UC in the state of Rhode Island. METHODS: The Ocean State
      Crohn's and Colitis Area Registry is a state-based inception cohort of patients
      newly diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Rhode Island. To confirm
      a diagnosis of CD, UC, or IBD unclassified (IBDU), the National Institute of
      Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases IBD Genetics Consortium criteria were 
      applied in a review of medical records from gastroenterology practices located in
      the state of Rhode Island and adjacent to the Rhode Island border in
      Massachusetts and Connecticut. Using population-based data, we determined the
      statewide incidence of IBD in Rhode Island from 2008 to 2010. RESULTS: A total of
      971 Rhode Island residents were diagnosed with IBD, including 444 with CD, 486
      with UC, and 41 with IBD unclassified from 2008 to 2010. The overall age- and
      sex-adjusted IBD incidence was 30.2 (95% confidence interval, 28.3-32.1) per
      100,000 persons in this time frame with 13.9, 15.1, and 1.3 per 100,000 diagnosed
      with CD, UC, and IBD unclassified, respectively. Of the total incident cases in
      Rhode Island, 30% (n = 291) were enrolled in Ocean State Crohn's and Colitis Area
      Registry for follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of IBD in Rhode Island is
      higher than that previously reported by other population-based cohorts in the
      United States. Prospective follow-up of individuals enrolled in the
      community-based Ocean State Crohn's and Colitis Area Registry cohort is ongoing.

AB  - Although cutaneous manifestations are the most common extraintestinal
      manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease, metastatic Crohn's disease (MCD) is 
      rare. MCD is defined as the presence of noncaseating granulomatous inflammation
      and perivascular infiltrate in the cutaneous tissue that is noncontiguous to the 
      gastrointestinal tract. MCD rarely involves the genitourinary tract in children. 
      When it does, it can present as external genitalia swelling, erythema, plaques,
      or ulcerations. Here we present three pediatric cases of MCD involving the
      genitourinary tract. In addition to discussion of the presented cases, we have
      reviewed the literature on the genitourinary presentation of MCD in the pediatric
      population.

TI  - Risk of Incident Cancer in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients Starting Anti-TNF 
      Therapy While Having Recent Malignancy.
PG  - 1362-9
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000741 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and history of
      malignancy within the last 5 years are usually contraindicated for receiving
      anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents. The aim of this study is to assess 
      survival without incident cancer in a cohort of IBD patients exposed to anti-TNF 
      while having previous malignancy within past 5 years. METHODS: Data from IBD
      patients with previous malignancy diagnosed within the last 5 years before
      starting an anti-TNF agent were collected through a Groupe d'Etude Therapeutiques
      des Affections Inflammatoires du tube Digestif multicenter survey. Inclusion date
      corresponded to the first anti-TNF administration after cancer diagnosis.
      RESULTS: Twenty centers identified 79 cases of IBD patients with previous
      malignancy diagnosed 17 months (median; range: 1-65) before inclusion. The most
      frequent cancer locations were breast (n = 17) and skin (n = 15). After a median 
      follow-up of 21 (range: 1-119) months, 15 (19%) patients developed incident
      cancer (8 recurrent and 7 new cancers), including 5 basal-cell carcinomas.
      Survival without incident cancer was 96%, 86%, and 66% at 1, 2, and 5 years,
      respectively. Crude incidence rate of cancer was 84.5 (95% CI, 83.1-85.8) per
      1000 patient-years. CONCLUSIONS: In a population of refractory IBD patients with 
      recent malignancy, anti-TNF could be used taking into account a mild risk of
      incident cancer. Pending prospective and larger studies, a case-by-case joint
      decision taken with the oncologist is recommended for managing these patients in 
      daily practice.

TI  - Diet therapy for inflammatory bowel diseases: The established and the new.
PG  - 2179-94
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i7.2179 [doi]
AB  - Although patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have a strong interest
      in dietary modifications as part of their therapeutic management, dietary advice 
      plays only a minor part in published guidelines. The scientific literature shows 
      that dietary factors might influence the risk of developing IBD, that dysbiosis
      induced by nutrition contributes to the pathogenesis of IBD, and that diet may
      serve as a symptomatic treatment for irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms in
      IBD. The role of nutrition in IBD is underscored by the effect of various dietary
      therapies. In paediatric patients with Crohn's disease (CD) enteral nutrition
      (EN) reaches remission rates similar to steroids. In adult patients, however, EN 
      is inferior to corticosteroids. EN is not effective in ulcerative colitis (UC).
      Total parenteral nutrition in IBD is not superior to steroids or EN. The use of
      specific probiotics in patients with IBD can be recommended only in special
      clinical situations. There is no evidence for efficacy of probiotics in CD. By
      contrast, studies in UC have shown a beneficial effect in selected patients. For 
      patients with pouchitis, antibiotic treatment followed by probiotics, like VSL#3 
      or Lactobacillus GG, is effective. When probiotics are used, the risk of
      bacterial translocation and subsequent bacteremia has to be considered. More
      understanding of the normal intestinal microflora, and better characterization of
      probiotic strains at the phenotypic and genomic levels is needed as well as
      clarification of the mechanisms of action in different clinical settings. A
      FODMAP reduced diet may improve symptoms in IBD.

TI  - Transient inhibition of ROR-gammat therapeutically limits intestinal inflammation
      by reducing TH17 cells and preserving group 3 innate lymphoid cells.
PG  - 319-23
LID - 10.1038/nm.4046 [doi]
AB  - RAR-related orphan receptor-gammat (ROR-gammat) directs differentiation of
      proinflammatory T helper 17 (TH17) cells and is a potential therapeutic target in
      chronic autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. However, ROR-gammat-dependent group
      3 innate lymphoid cells ILC3s provide essential immunity and tissue protection in
      the intestine, suggesting that targeting ROR-gammat could also result in impaired
      host defense after infection or enhanced tissue damage. Here, we demonstrate that
      transient chemical inhibition of ROR-gammat in mice selectively reduces cytokine 
      production from TH17 but not ILCs in the context of intestinal infection with
      Citrobacter rodentium, resulting in preserved innate immunity. Temporal deletion 
      of Rorc (encoding ROR-gammat) in mature ILCs also did not impair cytokine
      response in the steady state or during infection. Finally, pharmacologic
      inhibition of ROR-gammat provided therapeutic benefit in mouse models of
      intestinal inflammation and reduced the frequency of TH17 cells but not ILCs
      isolated from primary intestinal samples of individuals with inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). Collectively, these results reveal differential requirements for
      ROR-gammat in the maintenance of TH17 cell and ILC3 responses and suggest that
      transient inhibition of ROR-gammat is a safe and effective therapeutic approach
      during intestinal inflammation.

AB  - Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease is a chronic gastrointestinal disease
      consisting of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Both disease
      processes can share similar clinical symptoms including abdominal pain, diarrhea,
      hematochezia, and weight loss; CD can also be complicated by penetrating and
      fistulizing disease. Perianal skin tags, perianal abscesses, recto-cutaneous
      fistulae, and rectal stenosis are among the phenotypic characteristics of
      perianal CD. Current treatment strategies are focused on the surgical drainage of
      abscesses and the closure of fistulous tracts as well as controlling intestinal
      inflammation with the use of immunomodulators (6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate)
      and biologics (infliximab and adalimumab). Current guidelines by the American
      Gastroenterology Association and the North American Society for Pediatric
      Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition recommend a combination of surgical
      intervention and medical management for the treatment of perianal CD.

TI  - Response to strict and liberalized specific carbohydrate diet in pediatric
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 2111-7
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i6.2111 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To investigate the specific carbohydrate diet (SCD) as nutritional therapy
      for maintenance of remission in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS:
      Retrospective chart review was conducted in 11 pediatric patients with CD who
      initiated the SCD as therapy at time of diagnosis or flare. Two groups defined as
      SCD simple (diet alone, antibiotics or 5-ASA) or SCD with immunomodulators
      (corticosteroids and/or stable thiopurine dosing) were followed for one year and 
      compared on disease characteristics, laboratory values and anthropometrics.
      RESULTS: The mean age at start of the SCD was 11.8 +/- 3.0 years (range 6.6-17.6 
      years) with five patients starting the SCD within 5 wk of diagnosis. Three
      patients maintained a strict SCD diet for the study period and the mean time for 
      liberalization was 7.7 +/- 4.0 mo (range 1-12) for the remaining patients. In
      both groups, hematocrit, albumin and ESR values improved while on strict SCD and 
      appeared stable after liberalization (P-value 0.006, 0.002, 0.002 respectively). 
      The majority of children gained in weight and height percentile while on strict
      SCD, with small loss in weight percentile documented with liberalization.
      CONCLUSION: Disease control may be attainable with the SCD in pediatric CD.
      Further studies are needed to assess adherence, impact on mucosal healing and
      growth.

TI  - Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) for children with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 459-64
LID - 10.1007/s00383-016-3875-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) has been described in adults
      with Crohn's disease, but its use in pediatric Crohn's patients has been limited.
      The purpose of this study was to review our experience with SILS in pediatric
      patients with Crohn's disease. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed for 
      patients diagnosed with Crohn's disease who underwent small bowel resection or
      ileocecectomy at a freestanding children's hospital from 2006 to 2014. Data
      collected included demographic data, interval from diagnosis to surgery,
      operative time, length of stay, and postoperative outcomes. RESULTS: Analysis
      identified 19 patients who underwent open surgery (OS) and 41 patients who
      underwent SILS. One patient (2.4 %) within the SILS group required conversion to 
      OS. Demographic characteristics were similar between the 2 cohorts. The most
      common indication for surgery was stricture/obstruction (SILS 70.7 % vs. OS 68.4 
      %, p = 0.86), and ileocecectomy was the most common primary procedure performed
      (SILS 90.2 % vs. OS 100 % OS). Operative times were longer for SILS (135 +/- 50
      vs. 105 +/- 37 min, p = 0.02). However, when the last 20 SILS cases were compared
      to all OS cases, the difference was no longer statistically significant (SILS
      123.3 +/- 34.2 vs. OS 105 +/- 36.5, p = 0.12). No difference was noted in
      postoperative length of stay (SILS 6.5 +/- 2.2 days vs. OS 7.4 +/- 2.2 days, p = 
      0.16) or overall complication rate (SILS 24.4 % vs. OS 26.3 %, p = 0.16).
      CONCLUSION: SILS ileocecectomy is feasible in pediatric patients with Crohn's
      disease, achieving outcomes similar to OS. As experience increased, operative
      times also became comparable.

TI  - Perinatal vitamin D levels are not associated with later risk of developing
      pediatric-onset inflammatory bowel disease: a Danish case-cohort study.
PG  - 927-33
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2016.1144218 [doi]
AB  - Objective Basic and epidemiologic studies on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      have suggested an association between vitamin D and IBD risk. Though, the
      literature on IBD - especially pediatric-onset IBD - and vitamin D is still in
      its cradle. We therefore wanted to examine if levels of 25(OH)D at birth were
      associated with increased risk of developing pediatric-onset IBD. Material and
      methods A case-cohort study composed of cases diagnosed with Crohn's disease,
      ulcerative colitis or indeterminate/unclassified colitis and healthy controls.
      Cases and controls were matched on date of birth and were born in the period
      1981-2004. Cases were diagnosed before the age of 18 years. The concentration of 
      25(OH)D was assessed from neonatal dried blood spots using a highly sensitive
      liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated 
      using conditional logistic regression and two-way ANOVA were used to test for
      season and birth year 25(OH)D variations. A total of 384 matched pairs were
      included in the statistical analyses. Results No significant association were
      found between levels of 25(OH)D and IBD risk in the adjusted model (OR [95% CI]
      (per 25 nmol/L increase), 1.12 [0.88; 1.42], p = 0.35). 25(OH)D levels were found
      to fluctuate significantly with season (p < 0.001) and year (p < 0.001).
      Median/Q1-Q3 values for 25(OH)D were 27.1/16.5-39.5 nmol/L for cases and
      25.7/16.1-39.4 nmol/L for controls. Conclusion Our study do not suggest that a
      window of vulnerability exist around time of birth in regards to 25(OH)D levels
      and later pediatric-onset IBD risk.

TI  - Nutrition, gut microbiota and child health outcomes.
PG  - 208-13
LID - 10.1097/MCO.0000000000000266 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Diet is one of the main drivers of the composition and
      function of the gut microbiota. The scope of this review is to summarize recent
      studies assessing the role of gut microbiota in clinical pediatric conditions and
      to review studies using nutritional approaches to favorably modify the gut
      microbiota to improve health outcomes in children. RECENT FINDINGS: New studies
      underscore that breastfeeding and infant diet impact the gut microbiome and
      metagenome. A comprehensive study using metagenomic shotgun sequencing, suggests 
      that the cessation of breastfeeding rather than the introduction of solid foods, 
      drives the functional maturation of the infant gut microbiome toward an
      adult-like state. There is further support for the view that a disturbed early
      gut microbiota is implicated in allergic and autoimmune diseases. New studies
      using prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics in various pediatric disorders have 
      yielded promising results, yet the evidence for specific guidelines on their use 
      is still low. SUMMARY: Intestinal dysbiosis is associated with several pediatric 
      disorders but a cause-effect relationship remains to be clearly demonstrated in
      most conditions. Future studies using new systems biology approaches are
      anticipated to provide further insight into the functional capacities of the gut 
      microbiome and its establishment in childhood. This may then lay the ground for
      improved treatment and prevention strategies targeting the gut microbiota.

TI  - Palliative treatment of anal fistulas in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 148-51
LID - 10.1111/ans.13474 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Anal fistula in Crohn's disease is frequently an intractable
      condition. Methods of treatment are still debated because the results of various 
      procedures are unsatisfactory. Available studies show that results can be
      improved using a combination of surgical and medical methods. Most patients
      undergo rather palliative than radical, curative procedures such as incision and 
      drainage of abscesses and prolonged non-cutting seton placement. Surgery is
      combined today with biological therapy using infliximab, a murine-human chimeric 
      monoclonal antibody against TNF-alpha or adalimumab a human monoclonal anti-TNF
      antibody to increase the healing process and in an attempt to prevent fistula
      recurrence. METHODS: Medical records of 23 patients who were treated for anal
      fistulas in Crohn's disease between 2012 and 2014 were retrospectively evaluated.
      RESULTS: There were 10 (43%) males and 13 females. The mean age was 39 years
      (range 29-60 years). Median duration of CD before present treatment was 6 years
      (range 1-15 years). Closure of all fistulas in 6 months was achieved in eight
      (35%) patients, whereas reduction of at least 50% from base line in the number of
      draining fistulas occurred in four (17%) patients. CONCLUSION: Palliative and
      combined therapy for anal fistulas in Crohn's disease with surgery and infliximab
      or adalimumab therapy is an effective treatment for some patients.

TI  - Nutritional status of children with inflammatory bowel disease in Saudi Arabia.
PG  - 1854-8
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i5.1854 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To assess the prevalence of nutritional disorders in children with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: The data from a
      national cohort of children newly diagnosed with IBD between 2003 and 2012 were
      analyzed. The diagnosis of IBD and the differentiation between Crohn's disease
      (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) were confirmed by gastroenterologists according 
      to the standard criteria. The body mass index (BMI) of each child [weight
      (kg)/height(2) (m)] was calculated at the time of diagnosis. The World Health
      Organization standards and references were used and the BMI for age > +1 and < -2
      standard deviation score were used to define overweight and thinness,
      respectively. Age stratification analysis was performed to investigate any
      age-related variation in the prevalence of nutritional status between children < 
      10 years of age and older. RESULTS: There were 374 children from 0.33 to 17 years
      of age, including 119 (32%) children with UC and 255 (68%) with CD. All of the
      children were Saudi nationals, and 68 (57%) of the UC and 150 (59%) of the CD
      children were males. A positive history of anorexia at the time of diagnosis was 
      found in 30 (25%) patients with UC and 99 (39%) patients with CD. The prevalence 
      of thinness was 31%, 35% and 24% in children with IBD, CD and UC, respectively,
      with a significantly higher prevalence of thinness in children with CD than in
      children with UC (P = 0.037) only in the age group of 10-17 years (P = 0.030).
      The prevalence of overweight was 16 %, 15% and 20 % in the children with IBD, CD 
      and UC, respectively, indicating a higher prevalence in UC that was statistically
      significant only in the age group of 10-17 years (P = 0.020). CONCLUSION: A high 
      proportion of children with IBD presented with overweight instead of the
      classical underweight. Awareness of this finding is important for patient care.

TI  - Glutamine for induction of remission in Crohn's disease.
PG  - CD007348
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD007348.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is a chronic relapsing condition of the alimentary
      tract with a high morbidity secondary to bowel inflammation. Glutamine plays a
      key role in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal mucosa and has been shown
      to reduce inflammation and disease activity in experimental models of Crohn's
      disease. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of glutamine
      supplementation for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. SEARCH METHODS: We
      searched the following databases from inception to November 15, 2015: MEDLINE,
      EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane IBD 
      Group Specialised Register. Study references were also searched for additional
      trials. There were no language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised
      controlled trials (RCTs) that compared glutamine supplementation administered by 
      any route to a placebo, active comparator or no intervention in people with
      active Crohn's disease were considered for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND
      ANALYSIS: Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the
      methodological quality of the included studies. The Cochrane risk of bias tool
      was used to assess methodological quality. The primary outcome measure was
      clinical or endoscopic remission. Secondary outcomes included intestinal
      permeability, clinical response, quality of life, growth in children and adverse 
      events. Risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for dichotomous 
      outcomes. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the primary outcome was 
      evaluated using the GRADE criteria. MAIN RESULTS: Two small RCTs (total 42
      patients) met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. One study
      (18 patients) compared four weeks of treatment with a glutamine-enriched
      polymeric diet (42% amino acid composition) to a standard polymeric diet (4%
      amino acid composition) with low glutamine content in paediatric patients (< 18
      years of age) with active Crohn's disease. The other study (24 patients) compared
      glutamine-supplemented total parenteral nutrition to non-supplemented total
      parenteral nutrition in adult patients (> 18 years of age) with acute
      exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease. The paediatric study was rated as low
      risk of bias. The study in adult patients was rated as unclear risk of bias for
      blinding and low risk of bias for all other items. It was not possible to pool
      data for meta-analysis because of significant differences in study populations,
      nature of interventions, and the way outcomes were assessed. Data from one study 
      showed no statistically significant difference in clinical remission rates at
      four weeks. Forty-four per cent (4/9) of patients who received a
      glutamine-enriched polymeric diet achieved remission compared to 56% (5/9) of
      patients who received a standard low-glutamine polymeric diet (RR 0.80, 95% CI
      0.31 to 2.04). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of evidence
      for this outcome was low due to serious imprecision (9 events). In both included 
      studies, no statistically significant changes in intestinal permeability were
      found between patients who received glutamine supplementation and those who did
      not. Neither study reported on clinical response, quality of life or growth in
      children. Adverse event data were not well documented. There were no serious
      adverse events in the paediatric study. The study in adult patients reported
      three central catheter infections with positive blood cultures in the glutamine
      group compared to none in the control group (RR 7.00, 95% CI 0.40 to 122.44).
      AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Currently there is insufficient evidence to allow firm
      conclusions regarding the efficacy and safety of glutamine for induction of
      remission in Crohn's disease. Data from two small studies suggest that glutamine 
      supplementation may not be beneficial in active Crohn's disease but these results
      need to be interpreted with caution as they are based on small numbers of
      patients. This review highlights the need for adequately powered randomised
      controlled trials to investigate the efficacy and safety of glutamine for
      induction of remission in Crohn's disease.

TI  - Oral versus intravenous iron replacement therapy distinctly alters the gut
      microbiota and metabolome in patients with IBD.
PG  - 863-871
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2015-309940 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Iron deficiency is a common complication in patients with IBD and oral
      iron therapy is suggested to exacerbate IBD symptoms. We performed an
      open-labelled clinical trial to compare the effects of per oral (PO) versus
      intravenous (IV) iron replacement therapy (IRT). DESIGN: The study population
      included patients with Crohn's disease (CD; N=31), UC (N=22) and control subjects
      with iron deficiency (non-inflamed, NI=19). After randomisation, participants
      received iron sulfate (PO) or iron sucrose (IV) over 3 months. Clinical
      parameters, faecal bacterial communities and metabolomes were assessed before and
      after intervention. RESULTS: Both PO and IV treatments ameliorated iron
      deficiency, but higher ferritin levels were observed with IV. Changes in disease 
      activity were independent of iron treatment types. Faecal samples in IBD were
      characterised by marked interindividual differences, lower phylotype richness and
      proportions of Clostridiales. Metabolite analysis also showed separation of both 
      UC and CD from control anaemic participants. Major shifts in bacterial diversity 
      occurred in approximately half of all participants after IRT, but patients with
      CD were most susceptible. Despite individual-specific changes in phylotypes due
      to IRT, PO treatment was associated with decreased abundances of operational
      taxonomic units assigned to the species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii,
      Ruminococcus bromii, Dorea sp. and Collinsella aerofaciens. Clear IV-specific and
      PO-specific fingerprints were evident at the level of metabolomes, with changes
      affecting cholesterol-derived host substrates. CONCLUSIONS: Shifts in gut
      bacterial diversity and composition associated with iron treatment are pronounced
      in IBD participants. Despite similar clinical outcome, oral administration
      differentially affects bacterial phylotypes and faecal metabolites compared with 
      IV therapy. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: clinicaltrial.gov (NCT01067547).

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Inconsistent findings have been published regarding vitamin D status 
      among patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and the association with disease
      severity. We aimed to perform a meta-analysis evaluating serum 25-hydroxy vitamin
      D and 1,25 dehydroxyvitamin D among CD patients compared with healthy and
      non-healthy controls, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, and the association
      with disease. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, SCOPUS, EMBASE, and Google Scholar up
      to March 2015 for observational studies assessing serum vitamin D levels in CD
      patients. A total of 63 studies were included in the following four
      meta-analyses: 1) a meta-analysis on the mean difference of 25(OH)D levels in CD 
      patients compared with healthy (number of studies = 27) and non-healthy (n = 25) 
      controls; 2) a meta-analysis on the mean difference of 1,25(OH)2 D3 levels in CD 
      patients compared with healthy (n = 7) and non-healthy (n = 8) controls; 3) a
      meta-analysis on the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (n = 34); 4) a
      meta-analysis on the correlation coefficients between vitamin D status severity
      of CD (n = 6). Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were used to discover
      possible sources of between-study heterogeneity. RESULTS: It was found that CD
      patients had lower levels of 25(OH)D compared with healthy (-3.99 ng/mL; 95%
      confidence interval [CI]: -5.91 to -2.08) but not non-healthy controls (-1.07
      ng/mL; 95% CI: -2.84 to 0.70). There was also no significant mean difference for 
      1,25(OH)2 D3 for both healthy and non-healthy controls. Meta-analysis on the
      prevalence of vitamin D deficiency showed an overall prevalence of 57.7% (95% CI:
      0.502-0.649). An inverse association was observed between serum vitamin D and
      severity of CD (-0.36; 95% CI: -0.48 to -0.24). Meta-regression showed that mean 
      levels of 25(OH)D were decreased 0.09 for each unit change of latitude among CD
      patients compared with healthy controls (B = -0.09, P = 0.004, I(2) residual =
      86.08%). CONCLUSIONS: We found that patients with Crohn's disease had lower serum
      25(OH)D concentrations compared with their healthy counterparts, and more than
      half of them have hypovitaminosis D. Moreover, there was an inverse correlation
      between circulating 25(OH)D concentrations and severity of Crohn's disease.

TI  - Variants in TRIM22 That Affect NOD2 Signaling Are Associated With
      Very-Early-Onset Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Severe forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that develop 
      in very young children can be caused by variants in a single gene. We performed
      whole-exome sequence (WES) analysis to identify genetic factors that might cause 
      granulomatous colitis and severe perianal disease, with recurrent bacterial and
      viral infections, in an infant of consanguineous parents. METHODS: We performed
      targeted WES analysis of DNA collected from the patient and her parents. We
      validated our findings by a similar analysis of DNA from 150 patients with
      very-early-onset IBD not associated with known genetic factors analyzed in
      Toronto, Oxford, and Munich. We compared gene expression signatures in inflamed
      vs noninflamed intestinal and rectal tissues collected from patients with
      treatment-resistant Crohn's disease who participated in a trial of ustekinumab.
      We performed functional studies of identified variants in primary cells from
      patients and cell culture. RESULTS: We identified a homozygous variant in the
      tripartite motif containing 22 gene (TRIM22) of the patient, as well as in 2
      patients with a disease similar phenotype. Functional studies showed that the
      variant disrupted the ability of TRIM22 to regulate nucleotide binding
      oligomerization domain containing 2 (NOD2)-dependent activation of
      interferon-beta signaling and nuclear factor-kappaB. Computational studies
      demonstrated a correlation between the TRIM22-NOD2 network and signaling pathways
      and genetic factors associated very early onset and adult-onset IBD. TRIM22 is
      also associated with antiviral and mycobacterial effectors and markers of
      inflammation, such as fecal calprotectin, C-reactive protein, and Crohn's disease
      activity index scores. CONCLUSIONS: In WES and targeted exome sequence analyses
      of an infant with severe IBD characterized by granulomatous colitis and severe
      perianal disease, we identified a homozygous variant of TRIM22 that affects the
      ability of its product to regulate NOD2. Combined computational and functional
      studies showed that the TRIM22-NOD2 network regulates antiviral and antibacterial
      signaling pathways that contribute to inflammation. Further study of this network
      could lead to new disease markers and therapeutic targets for patients with very 
      early and adult-onset IBD.

TI  - Advancing nutritional therapy: A novel polymeric formulation attenuates
      intestinal inflammation in a murine colitis model and suppresses pro-inflammatory
      cytokine production in ex-vivo cultured inflamed colonic biopsies.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nutritional therapy is a viable therapeutic option for the
      treatment of Crohn disease (CD). Therefore improving nutritional therapy would
      greatly benefit CD patients. The aim of this study was to define the
      anti-inflammatory properties of a novel nutritional polymeric formula (PF) in
      comparison to a currently available standard PF. METHODS: Dextran sodium sulfate 
      (DSS) was utilized to induce colitis in C57BL/6 mice with mice randomized to
      receive either standard PF or novel PF in addition to control groups. Changes in 
      body weight were recorded and colonic damage was assessed histologically and
      biochemically. Additional experiments were also included where the cytokine
      response of colonic biopsies from pediatric CD patients was measured following
      exposure to standard PF or novel PF. RESULTS: DSS induced significant body weight
      loss, morphological changes in the colon, increased myeloperoxidase (MPO)
      activity and up-regulated colonic mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-12 and monocyte chemoattractant protein
      (MCP)-1, as well as associated histological changes. Other than histological
      damage, these inflammatory changes were reversed by both novel and standard PF.
      However, the novel PF, but not standard PF, completely suppressed TNF-alpha, IL-6
      and IL-8 levels from cultured biopsies. CONCLUSIONS: Newly developed nutritional 
      formula reproducibly ameliorated DSS-induced colitis in a murine model, although 
      this response was not measurably different to standard PF. However, the novel PF 
      was significantly superior in suppressing inflammatory cytokine release from
      cultured colonic biopsies. Collectively, these findings support a possible role
      for novel PF in advancing nutritional therapy for CD patients.

TI  - Heterogeneity in endoscopic treatment of Crohn's disease-associated strictures:
      An international inflammatory bowel disease specialist survey.
PG  - 939-48
LID - 10.1007/s00535-016-1172-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is frequently complicated by intestinal
      strictures, which are commonly treated by endoscopic balloon dilation (EBD).
      However, available data on this area of treatment is limited. The aim of this
      study was to depict the heterogeneity of endoscopic management of CD-associated
      strictures among international CD specialists to identify common treatment
      standards. METHODS: IBD experts of the International Organization for the Study
      of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IOIBD), the European Crohn's and Colitis
      Organization (ECCO), and from the Prospective Value In IBD trials (PROVIT)
      completed a web-based questionnaire to evaluate their endoscopic experience,
      practice setting, and number of EBDs performed annually. Additionally, two case
      scenarios and technical practice parameters were investigated. RESULTS: A total
      of 126 subjects from 15 countries completed the survey. The maximal length of
      dilated stricture was 4.5 +/- 1.7 cm. The most commonly used maximal balloon size
      was graded as 15-18 mm. While 87.2 % of the participants favored EBD for
      anastomotic strictures, only 58.6 % did so in the case of naive strictures. Only 
      35.7 % of physicians dilated actively inflamed strictures. Interventional
      endoscopists were more likely to dilate only clinically symptomatic strictures (p
      = 0.046). Surgeons favored surgical treatment of de novo ileocecal strictures
      compared to gastroenterologists (p = 0.026), reported a shorter stricture length 
      being amendable by EBD (p = 0.045), and more frequently used concomitant
      therapies (p = 0.001). Operator experience increased the likelihood of EBD use in
      actively inflamed strictures (p = 0.002), maximum length of stricture, and
      maximum balloon size (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: EBD is a widely used treatment
      approach for stricturing CD. Individual approaches differ significantly based on 
      background of the operator, experience level, and practice setting.

TI  - Identifying Patients at High Risk of Loss of Response to Infliximab Maintenance
      Therapy in Paediatric Crohn's Disease.
PG  - 795-804
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjw038 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Loss of response to infliximab resulting in discontinuation 
      of therapy is a frequent problem encountered in paediatric Crohn's disease.
      Although identifying patients at risk of failure could have important
      implications for follow-up, literature in this area remains sparse. Our primary
      aim was to identify predictors of loss of response to infliximab among patients
      who were responders to induction. The secondary aim was to identify predictors of
      non-response to induction. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of patients with
      paediatric Crohn's disease treated with infliximab between 2000 and 2013 was
      followed until loss of response to infliximab or transfer to adult care.
      Predictors of response to induction therapy were studied by multivariate logistic
      regression. Time to treatment failure was analysed with a multivariate Cox model.
      RESULTS: Two-hundred and forty-eight patients were eligible for the study. Of
      these, 196 (79%) were responders to induction (57% clinical remission and 22%
      clinical response) and 52 (21%) were non-responders. Steroid resistance was the
      only variable independently associated with primary non-response (odds ratio [OR]
      4.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.67-12.50, p = 0.002). Thirty-one of the 196 
      responders discontinued infliximab due to loss of response after a mean of
      1.6+/-1.3 years of treatment. Predictors of loss of response were level of
      response to induction (clinical response vs clinical remission, hazard ratio [HR]
      3.74, 95% CI 1.80-7.80, p = 0.0004) and isolated colonic disease (HR 2.72, 95% CI
      1.30-5.71, p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who fail to achieve clinical
      remission after induction and/or who have isolated colonic disease are at
      increased risk of loss of response to infliximab.

TI  - Short Bowel Syndrome and Intestinal Failure in Crohn's Disease.
PG  - 1209-18
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000698 [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease is a chronic and progressive inflammatory disorder of the
      gastrointestinal tract. Despite the availability of powerful immunosuppressants, 
      many patients with Crohn's disease still require one or more intestinal
      resections throughout the course of their disease. Multiple resections and a
      progressive reduction in bowel length can lead to the development of short bowel 
      syndrome, a form of intestinal failure that compromises fluid, electrolyte, and
      nutrient absorption. The pathophysiology of short bowel syndrome involves a
      reduction in intestinal surface area, alteration in the enteric hormonal
      feedback, dysmotility, and related comorbidities. Most patients will initially
      require parenteral nutrition as a primary or supplemental source of nutrition,
      although several patients may eventually wean off nutrition support depending on 
      the residual gut anatomy and adherence to medical and nutritional interventions. 
      Available surgical treatments focus on reducing motility, lengthening the native 
      small bowel, or small bowel transplantation. Care of these complex patients with 
      short bowel syndrome requires a multidisciplinary approach of physicians,
      dietitians, and nurses to provide optimal intestinal rehabilitation, nutritional 
      support, and improvement in quality of life.

AB  - Numerous environmental factors have been linked with inflammatory bowel disease. 
      These include smoking, diet, hygiene, drugs, geographical and psychosocial
      factors. These factors may either increase the risk of or protect against
      developing this condition and can also affect the course of illness in a positive
      or negative manner. A number of studies have examined the influence of
      environmental factors on inflammatory bowel diseases as a whole as well as on
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease separately. As there are differences in
      the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, the effect of
      environmental factors on their onset and course is not always similar. Some
      factors have shown a consistent association, while reports on others have been
      conflicting. In this article we discuss the current evidence on the roles of
      these factors on inflammatory bowel disease, both as causative/protective agents 
      and as modifiers of disease course.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
      disease are chronic, life-long, and relapsing diseases of the gastrointestinal
      tract. Currently, there are no complete cure possibilities, but combined
      pharmacological and nutritional therapy may induce remission of the disease.
      Malnutrition and specific nutritional deficiencies are frequent among IBD
      patients, so the majority of them need nutritional treatment, which not only
      improves the state of nutrition of the patients but has strong anti-inflammatory 
      activity as well. Moreover, some nutrients, from early stages of life are
      suspected as triggering factors in the etiopathogenesis of IBD. Both parenteral
      and enteral nutrition is used in IBD therapy, but their practical utility in
      different populations and in different countries is not clearly established, and 
      there are sometimes conflicting theories concerning the role of nutrition in IBD.
      This review presents the actual data from research studies on the influence of
      nutrition on the etiopathogenesis of IBD and the latest findings regarding its
      mechanisms of action. The use of both parenteral and enteral nutrition as
      therapeutic methods in induction and maintenance therapy in IBD treatment is also
      extensively discussed. Comparison of the latest research data, scientific
      theories concerning the role of nutrition in IBD, and different opinions about
      them are also presented and discussed. Additionally, some potential future
      perspectives for nutritional therapy are highlighted.

AB  - The relationship between the host and its microbiota is challenging to understand
      because both microbial communities and their environments are highly variable. We
      have developed a set of techniques based on population dynamics and information
      theory to address this challenge. These methods identify additional bacterial
      taxa associated with pediatric Crohn disease and can detect significant changes
      in microbial communities with fewer samples than previous statistical approaches 
      required. We have also substantially improved the accuracy of the diagnosis based
      on the microbiota from stool samples, and we found that the ecological niche of a
      microbe predicts its role in Crohn disease. Bacteria typically residing in the
      lumen of healthy individuals decrease in disease, whereas bacteria typically
      residing on the mucosa of healthy individuals increase in disease. Our results
      also show that the associations with Crohn disease are evolutionarily conserved
      and provide a mutual information-based method to depict dysbiosis.

TI  - Anti-TNF Monotherapy for Crohn's Disease: a 13-year Multicentre Experience.
PG  - 516-24
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjw008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anti-tumour necrosis factor [TNF] therapy in combination with
      thiopurine is the most effective strategy for Crohn's disease, but raises safety 
      concerns. METHODS: In a retrospective multicentre study, we investigated
      long-term outcome of patients starting anti-TNF monotherapy for Crohn's disease
      and investigated whether introducing an immunomodulator in patients losing
      response to anti-TNF monotherapy is effective for resetting immunogenicity.
      RESULTS: A total of 350 adult patients with Crohn's disease received either
      infliximab [n = 178, 51%] or adalimumab [n = 172, 49%] monotherapy. Mean duration
      of follow-up was 42 months. An immunomodulator was initiated in 53 patients
      [15%]. At last follow-up, 73.1% [n = 38] were in clinical remission [one patient 
      with missing data]. Multivariate analysis identified anti-TNF type [higher need
      for starting immunomodulator for infliximab than for adalimumab; p = 0.0058] and 
      first- vs second-/third-/fourth-line anti-TNF therapy [p = 0.014] as predictors
      of immunomodulator initiation. Among the 18 patients with available data,
      introduction of an immunomodulator was able to restore infliximab trough level
      within the therapeutic range and to induce clinical remission in 10 patients
      [55%]. Cumulative probability of remaining on anti-TNF therapy was 57.9% at 5
      years among the 297 patients not starting an immunomodulator during follow-up.
      CONCLUSION: An immunomodulator was initiated in 15% of patients with Crohn's
      disease starting anti-TNF monotherapy. Independent predictors of immunomodulator 
      initiation were infliximab use and second-/third-/fourth-line anti-TNF therapy.
      Resetting immunogenicity with an immunomodulator was effective in half of
      patients in a sub-study. Persistence of anti-TNF treatment at 5 years was
      observed in half of the 297 patients not starting an immumodulator in a real-life
      setting.

TI  - Gene expression profiling in necrotizing enterocolitis reveals pathways common to
      those reported in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 6
LID - 10.1186/s12920-016-0166-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most frequent life-threatening
      gastrointestinal disease experienced by premature infants in neonatal intensive
      care units. The challenge for neonatologists is to detect early clinical
      manifestations of NEC. One strategy would be to identify specific markers that
      could be used as early diagnostic tools to identify preterm infants most at risk 
      of developing NEC or in the event of a diagnostic dilemma of suspected disease.
      As a first step in this direction, we sought to determine the specific gene
      expression profile of NEC. METHODS: Deep sequencing (RNA-Seq) was used to
      establish the gene expression profiles in ileal samples obtained from preterm
      infants diagnosed with NEC and non-NEC conditions. Data were analyzed with
      Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and ToppCluster softwares. RESULTS: Data analysis
      indicated that the most significant functional pathways over-represented in NEC
      neonates were associated with immune functions, such as altered T and B cell
      signaling, B cell development, and the role of pattern recognition receptors for 
      bacteria and viruses. Among the genes that were strongly modulated in neonates
      with NEC, we observed a significant degree of similarity when compared with those
      reported in Crohn's disease, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease. CONCLUSIONS:
      Gene expression profile analysis revealed a predominantly altered immune response
      in the intestine of NEC neonates. Moreover, comparative analysis between NEC and 
      Crohn's disease gene expression repertoires revealed a surprisingly high degree
      of similarity between these two conditions suggesting a new avenue for
      identifying NEC biomarkers.

TI  - Reduced numbers of mucosal DR(int) macrophages and increased numbers of CD103(+) 
      dendritic cells during anti-TNF-alpha treatment in patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 692-9
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2015.1134649 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Anti-TNF-alpha treatment constitutes a mainstay in the treatment of
      Crohn's disease (CD), but its mechanisms of action are not fully understood. We
      aimed to investigate the effects of adalimumab, a human monoclonal TNF-alpha
      antibody, on macrophage (MQ) and dendritic cell (DC) subsets in mucosal biopsies 
      and peripheral blood. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Intestinal biopsies and blood samples
      were obtained from 12 different CD patients both before and 4 weeks after the
      initiation of the induction of adalimumab treatment. Endoscopic disease activity 
      was estimated by the Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease. Biopsies were
      obtained from inflamed and non-inflamed areas. The numbers of lamina propria CD14
      (+) DR(int) and CD14 (+) DR(hi) MQs, CD141(+), CD141(-) and CD103(+) DCs subsets,
      and circulating monocytes and DCs were analyzed using flow cytometry. RESULTS: At
      baseline, we observed higher numbers of DR(int) MQs and lower numbers of CD103(+)
      DCs in inflamed versus non-inflamed mucosa [843 vs. 391/10(5) lamina propria
      mononuclear cells (LPMCs) (p < 0.05) and 9 vs. 19 x 10(5) LPMCs (p = 0.01),
      respectively]. After four weeks of adalimumab treatment, the numbers of DR(int)
      MQs decreased [843 to 379/10(5) LPMCs (p = 0.03)], whereas the numbers of
      CD103(+) DCs increased [9-20 x 10(5) LPMCs (p = 0.003)] compared with baseline.
      In peripheral blood, no alterations were observed in monocyte or DC numbers
      between baseline and week 4. CONCLUSIONS: In CD, mucosal inflammation is
      associated with high numbers of DR(int) MQs and low numbers of CD103(+) DCs. This
      composition of intestinal myeloid subsets is reversed by anti-TNF-alpha
      treatment. These results suggest that DR(int) MQs play a pivotal role in CD
      inflammation.

TI  - Patients with Refractory Crohn's Disease Successfully Treated with Ustekinumab.
PG  - 397-401
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000624 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ustekinumab is a new biologic therapy targeting interleukin-12 and
      interleukin -23. It is currently approved for the treatment of psoriasis, but
      clinical trials have shown that it can induce and maintain remission in Crohn's
      disease (CD). We aim to evaluate effectiveness of ustekinumab in the treatment of
      CD. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed including patients (pts) 
      from 2 academic medical centers with complicated, refractory CD started on
      ustekinumab between June 2011 and June 2014. Pts were treated based on a novel
      subcutaneous dosing schedule designed to simulate the intravenous load used in
      clinical trials. RESULTS: Forty-five pts were treated with ustekinumab during
      this study period. Of the pts who had clinical parameters available before and
      after medication start, 46% achieved clinical response (Harvey-Bradshaw index
      decrease >/= 3) and 35% achieved clinical remission (Harvey-Bradshaw index </=
      3). Short inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire scores increased significantly
      (46 [20, 68] to 55 [32, 70], P < 0.05). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate decreased 
      significantly (20 [3, 54] to 12 [0, 42] mm/h, P < 0.05). C-reactive protein
      decreased significantly (4.9 [0.3, 111] to 3.3 [0.2, 226] mg/L, P < 0.05).
      Seventy-six percent of patients demonstrated an endoscopic response and 24%
      achieved complete endoscopic remission. Twelve patients (26%) were hospitalized
      for IBD-related issues. Four pts had infection-related complications. Six pts
      (13%) underwent surgery for IBD-related issues. Three pts stopped ustekinumab, 1 
      for pt preference and 2 for the lack of response. CONCLUSIONS: Using a novel
      subcutaneous dosing schedule, ustekinumab was successful in improving clinical,
      laboratory, and endoscopic markers of disease activity in patients with severe,
      refractory CD.

TI  - Steroid Administration and Growth Impairment in Children with Crohn's Disease.
PG  - 355-63
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000669 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Growth impairment remains a major concern in children with Crohn's
      disease, but evidence remains unclear, in particular, whether steroid use is
      implicated. We aimed to (1) determine the frequency of temporary (TGI) and
      permanent (PGI) growth impairment in children administered steroids and (2)
      examine whether cumulative steroid administration was associated with TGI and/or 
      PGI. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed in patients with Crohn's
      disease (<18 yr) administered steroids at the gastroenterology clinics of
      Sainte-Justine Hospital, Montreal. Steroid dosage, height during follow-up, adult
      height (after age 20), and parental heights were ascertained. Patients with
      height z score <-1.64 on more than 1 occasion before age 18 were considered as
      patients with TGI. Patients with adult heights <8.5 cm below the expected target 
      heights were considered as patients with PGI. Association between steroid dosage 
      and TGI/PGI was studied using logistic regression analyses. Data from the Swiss
      IBD Cohort Study were analyzed for comparison. RESULTS: A total of 221 children
      were studied. Approximately 19% (42/221) children were deemed as TGI, and 8/137
      patients (5.8%) had PGI. TGI was associated with diagnosis at younger age (P
      value 0.002) and steroid administration at younger age (P value 0.001), but not
      with steroid dosage. Final adult height was associated with target height, but
      not with cumulative steroid dosage. Rates of PGI in the Swiss cohort were
      approximately 9.1% in steroid users and 2.7% in nonusers. CONCLUSIONS: Most
      children with TGI attain normal adult heights. Cumulative steroid use does not
      seem to be associated with either TGI or PGI in children with Crohn's disease.

TI  - Western diet induces a shift in microbiota composition enhancing susceptibility
      to Adherent-Invasive E. coli infection and intestinal inflammation.
PG  - 19032
LID - 10.1038/srep19032 [doi]
AB  - Recent advances have shown that the abnormal inflammatory response observed in CD
      involves an interplay among intestinal microbiota, host genetics and
      environmental factors. The escalating consumption of fat and sugar in Western
      countries parallels an increased incidence of CD during the latter 20(th)
      century. The impact of a HF/HS diet in mice was evaluated for the gut
      micro-inflammation, intestinal microbiota composition, function and selection of 
      an E. coli population. The HF/HS diet created a specific inflammatory environment
      in the gut, correlated with intestinal mucosa dysbiosis characterized by an
      overgrowth of pro-inflammatory Proteobacteria such as E. coli, a decrease in
      protective bacteria, and a significantly decreased of SCFA concentrations. The
      expression of GPR43, a SCFA receptor was reduced in mice treated with a HF/HS
      diet and reduced in CD patients compared with controls. Interestingly, mice
      treated with an agonist of GPR43 were protected against DSS-induced colitis.
      Finally, the transplantation of feces from HF/HS treated mice to GF mice
      increased susceptibility to AIEC infection. Together, our results demonstrate
      that a Western diet could aggravate the inflammatory process and that the
      activation of the GPR43 receptor pathway could be used as a new strategy to treat
      CD patients.

TI  - Corticosteroid Use in a Prospective, Community-Based Cohort of Newly Diagnosed
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients.
PG  - 1635-40
LID - 10.1007/s10620-015-4010-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Systemic corticosteroids (CS) are a mainstay of treatment for
      patients with newly diagnosed inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Previous
      population-based studies report CS exposure rates range from 39 to 75 % within
      the first year of diagnosis with surgical resection rates as high as 13-18 % in
      the same time frame. These reports represent an older cohort of patients enrolled
      over prolonged periods of time and do not necessarily reflect current treatment
      approaches. We examine CS use during the first year of IBD diagnosis in a
      community-based, inception cohort. METHODS: Data were derived from the Ocean
      State Crohn's and Colitis Area Registry (OSCCAR), a prospective inception cohort 
      of IBD patients who are residents of Rhode Island. RESULTS: A total of 272
      patients were included in the current analyses. Overall, 60 % of Crohn's disease 
      and 57 % of ulcerative colitis patients were exposed to at least one course of CS
      during year 1 of study enrollment. Most notably, only 2 % of patients (n = 5)
      required a surgical resection. CONCLUSIONS: In this community-based cohort, 59 % 
      of patients were exposed to at least one course of CS during their first year of 
      enrollment. In contrast to previous studies, OSCCAR represents a more modern
      cohort of patients. While steroid exposure rates were similar or slightly higher 
      than those in previous reports, we observed a low rate of surgical resection. As 
      our cohort ages, future analysis will focus on the role more contemporary agents 
      may play on the low rates of surgery we observed.

TI  - Outcome of Surgery for Coloduodenal Fistula in Crohn's Disease.
PG  - 976-84
LID - 10.1007/s11605-015-3065-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to report the short- and long-term outcomes 
      of surgery for coloduodenal fistula in Crohn's disease and explore the effect of 
      preoperative optimization on surgical outcome. METHODS: This is a retrospective
      review of 34 patients with coloduodenal fistula complicating Crohn's disease
      between Jan 2008 and May 2015. Demographic information, preoperative management, 
      and intraoperative and postoperative outcome data were collected. RESULTS:
      Primary duodenal repair was carried out in 33 patients (13 with duodenal defect
      >3 cm), and bypass surgery was performed in one patient with duodenal stenosis.
      Patients undergoing preoperative optimization (n = 25) had decreased
      postoperative major (24.0 vs. 87.5 %, P = 0.005) and intra-abdominal septic (20.0
      vs. 75.0 %, P = 0.008) complications compared to patients with
      emergent/semi-emergent surgery (n = 8). No duodenal stenosis occurred on a median
      follow-up of 22.5 months. Patients with duodenum-ileocolic anastomosis fistula
      had longer postoperative stay (14.0 vs. 10.0 days, P = 0.032) and increased
      possibility of refistulization of the duodenum on follow-up (30.0 vs. 0 %, P =
      0.031) compared with those with spontaneous duodenum-colonic fistula. CONCLUSION:
      Primary duodenal repair can be safely performed in coloduodenal fistula in
      Crohn's disease provided there was no duodenal stenosis, even for large duodenal 
      defects. Preoperative optimization is associated with reduced postoperative
      complications. Patients with duodenum-ileocolic anastomosis fistula are more
      likely to have duodenum fistula recurrence compared to those with spontaneous
      duodenum-colonic fistula.

TI  - Rosacea in Patients with Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's Disease: A
      Population-based Case-control Study.
PG  - 680-7
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000644 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cutaneous manifestations are common in patients with inflammatory
      bowel diseases (IBDs) (ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn's disease [CD]).
      Previous case reports described patients with IBD who developed rosacea. IBD and 
      rosacea are inflammatory epithelial diseases, presumably associated with changes 
      in the innate immune system. We explored the association between IBD and incident
      rosacea. METHODS: We conducted a population-based matched (1:1) case-control
      analysis on the association between IBD and rosacea, stratified by IBD disease
      duration and severity. We used data from the UK-based Clinical Practice Research 
      Datalink. Cases had an incident diagnosis of rosacea recorded between 1995 and
      2013. RESULTS: Among 80,957 rosacea cases and the same number of controls, a
      history of UC was associated with an increased risk of rosacea (odds ratio [OR]
      1.65, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.43-1.90), with the highest OR in those with
      short UC duration (OR 2.85, 95% confidence interval, 1.80-4.50 for patients with 
      <2 years of disease history). A history of CD yielded an overall OR of 1.49 (95% 
      CI, 1.25-1.77), which did not correlate with disease duration. Additional
      analyses on IBD disease severity yielded evidence for a higher risk of rosacea in
      those with higher UC and CD activity. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide evidence 
      that patients with IBD may be at increased risk of rosacea (higher in UC),
      particularly during phases of increased IBD-associated gastrointestinal tract
      inflammation.

TI  - Dietary Patterns and Risk of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Europe: Results from
      the EPIC Study.
PG  - 345-54
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000638 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Specific nutrients or foods have been inconsistently associated with 
      ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) risks. Thus, we investigated
      associations between diet as a whole, as dietary patterns, and UC and CD risks.
      METHODS: Within the prospective EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into
      Cancer) study, we set up a nested matched case-control study among 366,351
      participants with inflammatory bowel disease data, including 256 incident cases
      of UC and 117 of CD, and 4 matched controls per case. Dietary intake was recorded
      at baseline from validated food frequency questionnaires. Incidence rate ratios
      of developing UC and CD were calculated for quintiles of the Mediterranean diet
      score and a posteriori dietary patterns produced by factor analysis. RESULTS: No 
      dietary pattern was associated with either UC or CD risks. However, when
      excluding cases occurring within the first 2 years after dietary assessment,
      there was a positive association between a "high sugar and soft drinks" pattern
      and UC risk (incidence rate ratios for the fifth versus first quintile, 1.68
      [1.00-2.82]; Ptrend = 0.02). When considering the foods most associated with the 
      pattern, high consumers of sugar and soft drinks were at higher UC risk only if
      they had low vegetables intakes. CONCLUSIONS: A diet imbalance with high
      consumption of sugar and soft drinks and low consumption of vegetables was
      associated with UC risk. Further studies are needed to investigate whether
      microbiota alterations or other mechanisms mediate this association.

TI  - Mucosal Barrier Depletion and Loss of Bacterial Diversity are Primary
      Abnormalities in Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis.
PG  - 462-71
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv223 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ulcerative colitis [UC] is associated with colonic mucosa
      barrier defects and bacterial dysbiosis, but these features may simply be the
      result of inflammation. Therefore, we sought to assess whether these features are
      inherently abrogated in the terminal ileum [TI] of UC patients, where
      inflammation is absent. METHODS: TI biopsies from paediatric inflammatory bowel
      disease [IBD] subsets [Crohn's disease [CD; n = 13] and UC [n = 10]], and non-IBD
      disease controls [n = 12] were histologically graded, and alcian blue/periodic
      acid-Schiff stained biopsies were quantified. The mucosal barrier was assessed
      for mucin [MUC2], immunoglobulin [Ig]A, IgG, and total bacteria (fluorescence
      in-situ hybridisation [FISH probe EUB338]) by immunofluorescence. The regulation 
      of mucin secretion was investigated by NLRP6 gene expression and
      immunofluorescence. The composition of the active mucosa-associated microbiota
      was explored by sequencing the 16S rRNA amplicon generated from total RNA.
      RESULTS: Despite the absence of ileitis, UC patients displayed ileal barrier
      depletion illustrated by reductions in mucin-containing goblet cells and mucin
      production and altered epithelial NLRP6 expression. In both CD patients with
      ileitis and UC patients with normal histology, bacteria coated with IgA and IgG
      penetrated the TI mucin layer. Biopsy 16S rRNA sequencing revealed a reduction in
      alpha-diversity by three methods [Shannon, Simpson, and Equitability indices]
      between UC and non-IBD paediatric patients. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest
      an underlying defect in the UC-afflicted intestinal tract even in the absence of 
      inflammation, implicating barrier and microbial changes as primary abnormalities 
      in UC that may play a causative role in disease development.

TI  - Specific carbohydrate diet for pediatric inflammatory bowel disease in clinical
      practice within an academic IBD center.
PG  - 418-25
LID - 10.1016/j.nut.2015.08.025 [doi]
LID - S0899-9007(15)00389-5 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Despite dietary factors being implicated in the pathogenesis of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), nutritional therapy, outside of exclusive
      enteral nutrition (EEN), has not had a defined role within the treatment paradigm
      of pediatric IBD within IBD centers. Based on emerging data, Seattle Children's
      Hospital IBD Center has developed an integrated dietary program incorporating the
      specific carbohydrate diet (SCD) into its treatment paradigm. This treatment
      paradigm uses the SCD as primary therapy as well as adjunctive therapy for the
      treatment of IBD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential effects of 
      the SCD on clinical outcomes and laboratory studies of pediatric patients with
      Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: In this retrospective 
      study, we reviewed the medical records of patients with IBD on SCD. RESULTS: We
      analyzed 26 children on the SCD: 20 with CD and 6 with UC. Duration of the
      dietary therapy ranged from 3 to 48 mo. In patients with active CD (Pediatric
      Crohn's Disease activity index [PCDAI] >10), PCDAI dropped from 32.8 +/- 13.2 at 
      baseline to 20.8 +/- 16.6 by 4 +/- 2 wk, and to 8.8 +/- 8.5 by 6 mo. The mean
      Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index for patients with active UC decreased
      from a baseline of 28.3 +/- 10.3 to 20.0 +/- 17.3 at 4 +/- 2 wk, to 18.3 +/- 31.7
      at 6 mo. CONCLUSION: This retrospective review provides evidence that the SCD can
      be integrated into a tertiary care center and may improve clinical and laboratory
      parameters for pediatric patients with nonstructuring, nonpenetrating CD as well 
      as UC. Further prospective studies are needed to fully assess the safety and
      efficacy of the SCD in pediatric patients with IBD.

TI  - Azathioprine is effective for oral involvement in Crohn's disease but not for
      orofacial granulomatosis alone.
PG  - 312-8
LID - 10.1111/jop.12379 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There have been no previous reports assessing the effectiveness of
      azathioprine (AZA) in the treatment of orofacial granulomatosis (OFG). This
      report is a review of patients receiving AZA for active OFG with or without
      concomitant gut Crohn's disease (CD) in a specialist tertiary referral centre.
      METHODS: Clinical response was defined by Global Physician Assessment at 4-, 12- 
      and 24-month follow-up and a standardised oral disease activity score (ODAS).
      RESULTS: Sixty of 215 patients seen with OFG in our clinic over a 12-year period 
      were treated with AZA. Of these, 22 had concomitant CD. The proportion of
      patients responding to AZA with a diagnosis of CD/OFG vs. OFG only at 4, 12 and
      24 months were 54% vs. 21% (P = 0.03), 59% vs. 21% (P = 0.003) and 41% vs. 24% (P
      = 0.16), respectively. A statistically significant difference was seen between
      starting and follow-up ODAS scores at 4 months in the CD/OFG group which was not 
      observed in the OFG only group. Factors predicting a need for AZA included a
      diagnosis of intestinal CD, sulcal swelling, sulcal ulcers and upper lip
      involvement. The factor predicting response to treatment was a diagnosis of CD at
      12 months of follow-up. No difference in the number of adverse effects was
      observed between the two groups of patients. CONCLUSIONS: AZA is significantly
      more effective in the treatment of oral disease with a concurrent diagnosis of CD
      rather than in the treatment of OFG alone.

TI  - Reversibility of Stricturing Crohn's Disease-Fact or Fiction?
PG  - 241-7
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000598 [doi]
AB  - Intestinal fibrosis is a common feature of Crohn's disease and may appear as a
      stricture, stenosis, or intestinal obstruction. Fibrostenosing Crohn's disease
      leads to a significantly impaired quality of life in affected patients and
      constitutes a challenging treatment situation. In the absence of specific medical
      antifibrotic treatment options, endoscopic or surgical therapy approaches with
      their potential harmful side effects are frequently used. However, our
      understanding of mechanisms of fibrogenesis in general and specifically
      intestinal fibrosis has emerged. Progression of fibrosis in the liver, lung, or
      skin can be halted or even reversed, and possible treatment targets have been
      identified. In face of this observation and given the fact that fibrotic
      alterations in various organs of the human body share distinct core
      characteristics, this article aims to address whether reversibility of intestinal
      fibrosis may be conceivable and to highlight promising research avenues and
      therapies.

PG  - 296-305
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv209 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Gut microbiota is involved in many physiological functions
      and its imbalance is associated with several diseases, particularly with
      inflammatory bowel diseases. Mucosa-associated microbiota could have a key role
      in induction of host immunity and in inflammatory process. Although the role of
      fungi has been suggested in inflammatory disease pathogenesis, the fungal
      microbiota has not yet been deeply explored. Here we analysed the bacterial and
      fungal composition of the mucosa-associated microbiota of Crohn's disease
      patients and healthy subjects. METHODS: Our prospective, observational study
      evaluated bacterial and fungal composition of mucosa-associated microbiota of 23 
      Crohn's disease patients [16 in flare, 7 in remission] and 10 healthy subjects,
      using 16S [MiSeq] and ITS2 [pyrosequencing] sequencing, respectively. Global
      fungal load was assessed by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
      RESULTS: Bacterial microbiota in Crohn's disease patients was characterised by a 
      restriction in biodiversity. with an increase of Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria.
      Global fungus load was significantly increased in Crohn's disease flare compared 
      with healthy subjects [p < 0.05]. In both groups, the colonic mucosa-associated
      fungal microbiota was dominated by Basidiomycota and Ascomycota phyla.
      Cystofilobasidiaceae family and Candida glabrata species were overrepresented in 
      Crohn's disease. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Filobasidium uniguttulatum species 
      were associated with non-inflamed mucosa, whereas Xylariales order was associated
      with inflamed mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the alteration of the
      bacterial microbiota and is the first demonstration of the existence of an
      altered fungal microbiota in Crohn's disease patients, suggesting that fungi may 
      play a role in pathogenesis.

AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) is rapidly increasing in children so an up to date knowledge
      of diagnosis, investigation and management is essential. Exclusive enteral
      nutrition is the first line treatment for active disease. The vast majority of
      children will need immunosuppressant treatment and around 20% will need treatment
      with biologics. Recent guidelines have helped make best use of available
      therapies.

TI  - Practical Use of Infliximab Concentration Monitoring in Pediatric Crohn Disease.
PG  - 715-22
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000001029 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) that guides infliximab (IFX)
      intensification strategies has been shown to improve IFX efficacy. We conducted a
      review to evaluate the utility of TDM in the assessment and subsequent management
      of IFX loss of response in our pediatric population with Crohn disease (CD).
      METHODS: Single-center retrospective study of patients with CD receiving IFX that
      had TDM from December 2009 to September 2013. We defined subtherapeutic trough as
      a drug level below the detection limit of the Prometheus enzyme-linked
      immunoabsorbant assay and Anser reference values (1.4 and 1 mug/mL, respectively)
      or a mid-interval level <12 mug/mL. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-one IFX
      concentration tests were performed on 72 patients with CD with loss of response
      to therapy as the primary indication (72%). 34% of all TDM were subtherapeutic.
      After initial TDM, 25 of the 72 patients received regimen intensification with
      72% in clinical remission at 6 months. Including all of the TDM that resulted in 
      IFX dose intensification, we found a significant improvement in 6-month remission
      rates whether intensification followed mid-interval (88% remission) or trough
      (56% remission) testing (P = 0.026). Antibody to infliximab was found in 14
      patients with 5 occurring in the first year of therapy. Furthermore, 71% of
      patients with antibody to infliximab that were switched to an alternative
      anti-tumor necrosis factor achieved clinical remission at six months. In
      multivariable regression analysis, we found IFX dose (mg/kg), IFX dosing
      frequency (weeks), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate at the previous
      infusion were significantly associated with the IFX concentration. CONCLUSIONS:
      TDM in our pediatric population with CD led to informed clinical decisions and
      improved rates of clinical remission.

TI  - Quality of Life in Swiss Paediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: Do
      Patients and Their Parents Experience Disease in the Same Way?
PG  - 269-76
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv199 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) may impair quality of
      life (QoL) in paediatric patients. We aimed to evaluate in a nationwide cohort
      whether patients experience QoL in a different way when compared with their
      parents. METHODS: Sociodemographic and psychosocial characteristics were
      prospectively acquired from paediatric patients and their parents included in the
      Swiss IBD Cohort Study. Disease activity was evaluated by the Paediatric Crohn's 
      Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) and the Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity
      Index (PUCAI). We assessed QoL using the KIDSCREEN questionnaire. The QoL domains
      were analysed and compared between children and parents according to type of
      disease, parents' age, origin, education and marital status. RESULTS: We included
      110 children and parents (59 Crohn's disease [CD], 45 ulcerative colitis [UC], 6 
      IBD unclassified [IBDU]). There was no significant difference in QoL between CD
      and UC/IBDU, whether the disease was active or in remission. Parents perceived
      overall QoL, as well as 'mood', 'family' and 'friends' domains, lower than the
      children themselves, independently of their place of birth and education.
      However, better concordance was found on 'school performance' and 'physical
      activity' domains. Marital status and age of parents significantly influenced the
      evaluation of QoL. Mothers and fathers being married or cohabiting perceived
      significantly lower mood, family and friends domains than their children, whereas
      mothers living alone had a lower perception of the friends domain; fathers living
      alone had a lower perception of family and mood subscores. CONCLUSION: Parents of
      Swiss paediatric IBD patients significantly underestimate overall QoL and domains
      of QoL of their children independently of origin and education.

TI  - Association Between Long-Term Lipid Profiles and Disease Severity in a Large
      Cohort of Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
PG  - 865-71
LID - 10.1007/s10620-015-3932-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been linked to an increased risk
      of coronary heart disease and stroke. Dyslipidemia is a well-established risk
      factor for cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the
      long-term lipid profiles in a large cohort of IBD patients. METHODS: Data of
      patients from an IBD registry who had more than one measurement of total
      cholesterol and triglyceride levels during the follow-up period were analyzed.
      The lipid profiles of IBD patients were compared to those of the general
      population according to National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
      (2009-2012). Quartiles of cholesterol or triglyceride levels in relation to
      surrogate markers of disease severity were analyzed. RESULTS: Seven hundred and
      one IBD patients [54% Crohn's disease (CD), 46% ulcerative colitis (UC)] were
      included. IBD patients had less frequent high total cholesterol and high LDL
      cholesterol (6 vs. 13 and 5 vs. 10%) and more frequent low HDL and high
      triglycerides (24 vs. 17 and 33 vs. 25%) compared to the general population (all 
      p < 0.001). Median total cholesterol levels were lower and median triglycerides
      higher in CD compared to UC (171 vs. 184; 123 vs. 100 mg/dL; both p < 0.001). In 
      the multiple regression analysis, lipid profile was independently associated with
      hospitalizations (low cholesterol) and IBD surgeries (low cholesterol and high
      triglycerides). CONCLUSIONS: Low total cholesterol and high triglyceride levels
      are more frequent in IBD patients (in particular CD) compared to healthy controls
      and are independently associated with more severe disease.

TI  - IBD Genetic Risk Profile in Healthy First-Degree Relatives of Crohn's Disease
      Patients.
PG  - 209-15
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv197 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Family history provides important information on risk of developing
      inflammatory bowel disease [IBD], and genetic profiling of first-degree relatives
      [FDR] of Crohn's disease [CD]- affected individuals might provide additional
      information. We aimed to delineate the genetic contribution to the increased IBD 
      susceptibility observed in FDR. METHODS: N = 976 Caucasian, healthy, non-related 
      FDR; n = 4997 independent CD; and n = 5000 healthy controls [HC]; were studied.
      Genotyping for 158 IBD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs] was
      performed using the Illumina Immunochip. Risk allele frequency [RAF] differences 
      between FDR and HC cohorts were correlated with those between CD and HC cohorts. 
      CD and IBD genetic risk scores [GRS] were calculated and compared between HC,
      FDR, and CD cohorts. RESULTS: IBD-associated SNP RAF differences in FDR and HC
      cohorts were strongly correlated with those in CD and HC cohorts, correlation
      coefficient 0.63 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53 - 0.72), p = 9.90 x 10(-19). 
      There was a significant increase in CD-GRS [mean] comparing HC, FDR, and CD
      cohorts: 0.0244, 0.0250, and 0.0257 respectively [p < 1.00 x 10(-7) for each
      comparison]. There was no significant difference in the IBD-GRS between HC and
      FDR cohorts [p = 0.81]; however, IBD-GRS was significantly higher in CD compared 
      with FDR and HC cohorts [p < 1.00 x 10(-10) for each comparison]. CONCLUSION: FDR
      of CD-affected individuals are enriched with IBD risk alleles compared with HC.
      Cumulative CD-specific genetic risk is increased in FDR compared with HC.
      Prospective studies are required to determine if genotyping would facilitate
      better risk stratification of FDR.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the two major forms of
      inflammatory bowel disease; treatment strategies have historically been
      determined by this binary categorisation. Genetic studies have identified 163
      susceptibility loci for inflammatory bowel disease, mostly shared between Crohn's
      disease and ulcerative colitis. We undertook the largest genotype association
      study, to date, in widely used clinical subphenotypes of inflammatory bowel
      disease with the goal of further understanding the biological relations between
      diseases. METHODS: This study included patients from 49 centres in 16 countries
      in Europe, North America, and Australasia. We applied the Montreal classification
      system of inflammatory bowel disease subphenotypes to 34,819 patients (19,713
      with Crohn's disease, 14,683 with ulcerative colitis) genotyped on the Immunochip
      array. We tested for genotype-phenotype associations across 156,154 genetic
      variants. We generated genetic risk scores by combining information from all
      known inflammatory bowel disease associations to summarise the total load of
      genetic risk for a particular phenotype. We used these risk scores to test the
      hypothesis that colonic Crohn's disease, ileal Crohn's disease, and ulcerative
      colitis are all genetically distinct from each other, and to attempt to identify 
      patients with a mismatch between clinical diagnosis and genetic risk profile.
      FINDINGS: After quality control, the primary analysis included 29,838 patients
      (16,902 with Crohn's disease, 12,597 with ulcerative colitis). Three loci (NOD2, 
      MHC, and MST1 3p21) were associated with subphenotypes of inflammatory bowel
      disease, mainly disease location (essentially fixed over time; median follow-up
      of 10.5 years). Little or no genetic association with disease behaviour (which
      changed dramatically over time) remained after conditioning on disease location
      and age at onset. The genetic risk score representing all known risk alleles for 
      inflammatory bowel disease showed strong association with disease subphenotype
      (p=1.65 x 10(-78)), even after exclusion of NOD2, MHC, and 3p21 (p=9.23 x
      10(-18)). Predictive models based on the genetic risk score strongly
      distinguished colonic from ileal Crohn's disease. Our genetic risk score could
      also identify a small number of patients with discrepant genetic risk profiles
      who were significantly more likely to have a revised diagnosis after follow-up
      (p=6.8 x 10(-4)). INTERPRETATION: Our data support a continuum of disorders
      within inflammatory bowel disease, much better explained by three groups (ileal
      Crohn's disease, colonic Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis) than by Crohn's
      disease and ulcerative colitis as currently defined. Disease location is an
      intrinsic aspect of a patient's disease, in part genetically determined, and the

TI  - Ocular Manifestations in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Are Associated with Other
      Extra-intestinal Manifestations, Gender, and Genes Implicated in Other
      Immune-related Traits.
PG  - 43-9
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv178 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There has been considerable progress in identifying inflammatory
      bowel disease [IBD] susceptibility genes but little progress in examining the
      role of genetic variation in the development of the extra-intestinal
      manifestations [EIMs] of IBD. This study identified clinical, serological, and
      genetic factors associated with ocular EIMs [O-EIMs] in IBD. METHODS: We
      performed a retrospective case-control study of IBD patients, comparing those
      with and without O-EIMs using the Cedars-Sinai IBD Research Repository and the
      NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium Repository. Genotyping was performed using Illumina
      whole genome platforms. RESULTS: In all, 124 cases and 3328 controls with
      available clinical data were identified; 103 cases and 2808 controls had genetic 
      data available. Erythema nodosum and peripheral arthritis particularly were
      common in patients with O-EIMs [p = 2.77 x 10(-13) and p = 2.58 x 10(-13),
      respectively] with increasing odds ratios for O-EIMs with each additional
      non-ocular-EIM [for >/= 2 EIMs, odds ratio 14.72]. Nominal association with
      O-EIMs was observed at several known IBD susceptibility single nuclear
      polymorphisms. One locus, containing RBM19, achieved genome-wide level of
      significance for association with O-EIMs. CONCLUSIONS: In IBD, O-EIMs co-occur
      with musculoskeletal and skin manifestations and, in this study, are nominally
      associated with known IBD loci. Additional cohorts are needed to verify these
      results and identify additional genes.

TI  - Defects in 15-HETE Production and Control of Epithelial Permeability by Human
      Enteric Glial Cells From Patients With Crohn's Disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Enteric glial cells (EGCs) produce soluble mediators that
      regulate homeostasis and permeability of the intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB).
      We investigated the profile of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolites
      produced by EGCs from rats and from patients with Crohn's disease (CD), compared 
      with controls, along with the ability of one of these metabolites,
      15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE), to regulate the permeability of the
      IEB. METHODS: We isolated EGCs from male Sprague-Dawley rats, intestinal
      resections of 6 patients with CD, and uninflamed healthy areas of intestinal
      tissue from 6 patients who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer (controls).
      EGC-conditioned media was analyzed by high-sensitivity liquid-chromatography
      tandem mass spectrometry to determine PUFA signatures. We used immunostaining to 
      identify 15-HETE-producing enzymes in EGCs and tissues. The effects of human EGCs
      and 15-HETE on permeability and transepithelial electrical resistance of the IEB 
      were measured using Caco-2 cells; effects on signal transduction proteins were
      measured with immunoblots. Levels of proteins were reduced in Caco-2 cells using 
      short-hairpin RNAs or proteins were inhibited pharmacologically. Rats were given 
      intraperitoneal injections of 15-HETE or an inhibitor of 15-lipoxygenase (the
      enzyme that produces 15-HETE); colons were collected and permeability was
      measured. RESULTS: EGCs expressed 15-lipoxygenase-2 and produced high levels of
      15-HETE, which increased IEB resistance and reduced IEB permeability. 15-HETE
      production was reduced in EGCs from patients with CD compared with controls. EGCs
      from patients with CD were unable to reduce the permeability of the IEB; the
      addition of 15-HETE restored permeability to levels of control tissues.
      Inhibiting 15-HETE production in rats increased the permeability of the IEB in
      colon tissues. We found that 15-HETE regulates IEB permeability by inhibiting an 
      adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and increasing expression of
      zonula occludens-1. CONCLUSIONS: Enteric glial cells from patients with CD have
      reduced production of 15-HETE, which controls IEB permeability by inhibiting
      adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and increasing expression of
      zonula occludens-1.

TI  - DNA Methylation Profiling in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Provides New Insights
      into Disease Pathogenesis.
PG  - 77-86
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjv176 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are heterogeneous
      disorders with complex aetiology. Quantitative genetic studies suggest that only 
      a small proportion of the disease variance observed in IBD is accounted for by
      genetic variation, indicating a potential role for differential epigenetic
      regulation in disease aetiology. The aim of this study was to assess genome-wide 
      DNA methylation changes specifically associated with ulcerative colitis (UC),
      Crohn's disease (CD) and IBD activity. METHODS: DNA methylation was quantified in
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 149 IBD cases (61 UC, 88 CD) and 
      39 controls using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Technical and
      functional validation was performed using pyrosequencing and the real-time
      polymerase chain reaction. Cross-tissue replication of the top differentially
      methylated positions (DMPs) was tested in colonic mucosa tissue samples obtained 
      from paediatric IBD cases and controls. RESULTS: A total of 3196 probes were
      differentially methylated between CD cases and controls, while 1481 probes were
      differentially methylated between UC cases and controls. There was considerable
      (45%) overlap between UC and CD DMPs. The top-ranked IBD-associated PBMC
      differentially methylated region (promoter region of TRIM39-RPP2) was also
      significantly hypomethylated in colonic mucosa from paediatric UC patients. In
      addition, we confirmed TRAF6 hypermethylation using pyrosequencing and found
      reduced TRAF6 gene expression in PBMCs of IBD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our data
      provide new insights into differential epigenetic regulation of genes and
      molecular pathways, which may contribute to the pathogenesis and activity of IBD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Systemic inflammation and nutritional deficiencies are
      characteristics of Crohn's disease (CD) and have been suggested to influence
      cognitive performance. This study assessed cognitive function in patients with
      CD. METHODS: Participants were adult patients with CD arriving at routine
      follow-up. Subjective cognitive complaints, depression, anxiety, fatigue, and
      sleep were evaluated by validated questionnaires. CD characteristics, blood
      tests, and Crohn's disease activity index were obtained. Nutritional risk index
      was derived from serum albumin and change in body weight. Montreal cognitive
      assessment was used for screening. Patients with either subjective cognitive
      complaints or Montreal cognitive assessment score </= 26 were tested by a
      computerized cognitive testing battery, with analysis of scores in 7 cognitive
      domains (CogDs) and an average of the CogD scores-global cognitive score (GCS).
      Impaired CogD was defined as scoring more than 1 SD below age and education
      adjusted average. RESULTS: A total of 105 patients were recruited and 61 were
      tested with computerized cognitive testing battery. Mean age was 39 +/- 13 and
      mean education years were 14 +/- 2. The most commonly impaired CogDs were
      information processing speed (33%) and verbal function (28%). Crohn's disease
      activity index, nutritional risk index, and hemoglobin were significantly
      correlated with GCS (r = -0.34, 0.39, 0.33; P = 0.007, 0.003, 0.01). Linear
      regression revealed significant correlations between Crohn's disease activity
      index, nutritional risk index, and GCS (beta = -0.3, 0.29; P = 0.03, 0.04),
      independent of depression. This model explained 24% of the variance in GCS.
      CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive performance is related to CD activity and nutritional
      status. The results provide insight into potential influence of nutrition and
      inflammation on cognitive function. Further studies on cognitive function of
      patients with CD are warranted.

AB  - PURPOSE: Determination of overweight and obesity prevalence in children with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) at the time of diagnosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 
      This was a multicenter retrospective study. The study group consisted of children
      with new cases of IBD diagnosed in 2005-2013 according to the Porto criteria.
      Hospital admission records were reviewed for demographic and clinical
      characteristics. BMI-for-age and gender percentile charts were used to define
      overweight as >/=85th BMI percentile and obesity as >/=95th BMI percentile.
      RESULTS: 675 patients were evaluated: 368 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 307 with 
      ulcerative colitis (UC). Of these, 54.8% were boys and 45.2% were girls. There
      were no statistically significant differences in age, weight, height and disease 
      activity between the CD and UC patients. The UC patients had higher BMI values
      than the CD patients. The prevalence of overweight and obesity was higher in the 
      UC than the CD patients (4.89% CI95 2.76-7.93 vs. 2.45% CI95 1.12-4.59 and 8.47% 
      CI95 5.61-12.16 vs. 1.9% CI95 0.77-3.88, respectively); the differences were
      statistically significant (-2.44% CI95 -5.45 to 0.49 and -6.57% CI95 -10 to -3.1,
      respectively). The risk of overweight/obesity was 3.5 times higher for patients
      with UC (OR=0.272, CI95 0.14-0.49, p=0.0004). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of
      overweight and obesity in newly diagnosed children with IBD was 8.4% and was
      higher in patients with UC than in patients with CD. The results of this study
      have shown that not only malnourished children may suffer from IBD but also
      children who are overweight or obese at the time of diagnosis.

TI  - The gut microbiota and host health: a new clinical frontier.
PG  - 330-9
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2015-309990 [doi]
AB  - Over the last 10-15 years, our understanding of the composition and functions of 
      the human gut microbiota has increased exponentially. To a large extent, this has
      been due to new 'omic' technologies that have facilitated large-scale analysis of
      the genetic and metabolic profile of this microbial community, revealing it to be
      comparable in influence to a new organ in the body and offering the possibility
      of a new route for therapeutic intervention. Moreover, it might be more accurate 
      to think of it like an immune system: a collection of cells that work in unison
      with the host and that can promote health but sometimes initiate disease. This
      review gives an update on the current knowledge in the area of gut disorders, in 
      particular metabolic syndrome and obesity-related disease, liver disease, IBD and
      colorectal cancer. The potential of manipulating the gut microbiota in these
      disorders is assessed, with an examination of the latest and most relevant
      evidence relating to antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, polyphenols and faecal 
      microbiota transplantation.

      Alters Classification of Disease Location.
PG  - 242-5
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000967 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate the value of microscopic
      findings in the classification of pediatric Crohn disease (CD) by determining
      whether classification of disease changes significantly with inclusion of
      histologic findings. METHODS: Sixty patients were randomly selected from a cohort
      of patients studied at the Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease Clinic at the
      University of California, San Francisco Benioff Children's Hospital. Two
      physicians independently reviewed the electronic health records of the included
      patients to determine the Paris classification for each patient by adhering to
      present guidelines and then by including microscopic findings. RESULTS:
      Macroscopic and combined disease location classifications were discordant in 34
      (56.6%), with no statistically significant differences between groups.
      Interobserver agreement was higher in the combined classification (kappa = 0.73, 
      95% confidence interval 0.65-0.82) as opposed to when classification was limited 
      to macroscopic findings (kappa = 0.53, 95% confidence interval 0.40-0.58). When
      evaluating the proximal upper gastrointestinal tract (Paris L4a), the
      interobserver agreement was better in macroscopic compared with the combined
      classification. CONCLUSIONS: Disease extent classifications differed
      significantly when comparing isolated macroscopic findings (Paris classification)
      with the combined scheme that included microscopy. Further studies are needed to 
      determine which scheme provides more accurate representation of disease extent.

AB  - The incidence of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn
      disease and ulcerative colitis, has risen alarmingly in the Western and
      developing world in recent decades. Epidemiologic (including monozygotic twin and
      migrant) studies highlight the substantial role of environment and nutrition in
      IBD etiology. Here we review the literature supporting the developmental and
      environmental origins hypothesis of IBD. We also provide a detailed exploration
      of how the human microbiome and epigenome (primarily through DNA methylation) may
      be important elements in the developmental origins of IBD in both children and
      adults.

TI  - Practice Variations in the Management of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Between
      Pediatric and Adult Gastroenterologists.
PG  - 372-7
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000000943 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Different practice guidelines and consensus statements for both
      pediatric- and adult-onset inflammatory bowel disease exist. Although variations 
      in medical care among gastroenterologists are common, it is unknown whether there
      are fundamental differences between disciplines. The primary aim of the present
      study was to investigate differences in common practices across disciplines.
      METHODS: This was a prospective, questionnaire-based survey of
      gastroenterologists attending gastroenterology meetings in Israel. The
      questionnaire covered attitudes to medical resources, diagnostic and follow-up
      measures as well as therapeutic approaches. RESULTS: Overall, 120 (60%) of the
      approached adult gastroenterologists (AGs) and 49 (75%) pediatric
      gastroenterologists (PGs) completed the questionnaire. The 2 groups differed
      significantly in various practice areas. Pediatric patients are seen more
      frequently and for longer appointments. PGs tend to assess thiopurine metabolites
      (96% vs 47%) more often during treatment. There is a significant variation in
      practice between groups concerning infectious serology status and vaccinations.
      Methotrexate in Crohn patients is used more commonly by PGs (55% vs 22%).
      Long-term combination therapy of thiopurines and anti-tumor necrosis factoralpha 
      agents is used more often by AGs. In patients with ulcerative colitis AGs use
      oral 5-aminosalicylic acid once daily (51% vs 21%) and add rectal agents from the
      first day of treatment (72% vs 35%) more often as compared with PGs. CONCLUSIONS:
      This study demonstrates that common practices in inflammatory bowel disease
      patients differ significantly between adult and pediatric practitioners. These
      findings call for investigating the reasons for these differences and promoting
      strategies to diminish these gaps.

TI  - Enteral nutrition for maintaining remission in patients with quiescent Crohn's
      disease: current status and future perspectives.
PG  - 1-7
LID - 10.1007/s00384-015-2348-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The value of enteral nutrition (EN) as maintenance therapy in patients
      with quiescent Crohn's disease (CD) has not been fully evaluated. The purpose of 
      this study was to review the efficacy of EN for the maintenance of remission in
      patients with quiescent CD. METHODS: Seven prospective cohort studies evaluating 
      the efficacy of EN for the maintenance of remission in quiescent CD were
      included. Three of the seven studies were randomized-controlled trials (RCTs). In
      all studies, patients used EN as a supplement or as a nocturnal tube feeding in
      addition to their normal food. RESULTS: One study compared the efficacy of
      elemental diet and polymeric diet. Elemental and polymeric diets were equally
      effective for the maintenance of clinical remission and for allowing tapering and
      cessation of steroid therapy. The other six studies compared the outcomes between
      patients treated with and without EN. The maintained clinical remission rate at 1
      year was significantly higher in patients treated with EN in four of the six
      studies. Quantitative pooling of the studies was not feasible due to a small
      number of RCTs and a narrative account of the study characteristics. CONCLUSIONS:
      Our review suggests that EN is useful for the maintenance of remission in
      patients with quiescent CD. However, there are several limitations in the
      reviewed studies. There are few RCTs. Further, the sample size is small, and the 
      duration of intervention and follow-up is short. Large and well-designed RCTs
      should be conducted to rigorously evaluate the efficacy of EN for maintaining
      remission.

TI  - Perioperative Parenteral Nutrition in Adults With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A
      Review of the Literature.
PG  - 159-70
LID - 10.1177/0884533615594011 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory condition with
      numerous nutrition implications, including an increased risk of malnutrition and 
      various nutrient deficiencies. Surgical interventions are often necessary in the 
      treatment of IBD, and patients with IBD presenting for surgery often have
      multiple issues, including acute inflammatory processes, malnutrition, anemia,
      and infections, which may increase the likelihood of poor surgical outcomes.
      Thus, determining adjunctive treatments that may decrease postoperative
      complications is paramount. Although enteral nutrition (EN) is considered the
      preferred nutrition support modality when the gastrointestinal tract is
      accessible and functional, parenteral nutrition (PN) may provide a suitable
      alternative when the use of EN is not feasible. The aim of this review is to
      evaluate the currently available literature on the impact of perioperative PN on 
      postoperative complications, disease severity, and nutrition status in adults
      with IBD. Six studies within the past 10 years investigated this topic and are
      analyzed here. Results indicate general trends toward improvements in
      postoperative outcomes, disease severity, and nutrition status associated with
      perioperative PN use. Although results appear promising, additional, larger
      studies with an emphasis on PN composition will improve our understanding of the 
      benefits of perioperative PN in adults with IBD.

TI  - Health Insurance Paid Costs and Drivers of Costs for Patients With Crohn's
      Disease in the United States.
PG  - 15-23
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2015.207 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The cost of medical care for Crohn's disease (CD) and comorbidities
      in the era of biologics is unclear. We examined insurance claims data from US
      health plans to understand this relationship. METHODS: Longitudinal CD patient
      data and reimbursement information from 11 health plans engaged with Accordant
      Health Services between 2011 and 2013 were analyzed. The analysis considered data
      for all CD patients and for the patient subgroup </=20 years and >20 years of
      age. Descriptive statistics measured the mean health-plan paid costs per patient,
      the relative cost contribution of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents, and
      health care costs for 31 specific comorbid conditions among CD patients. RESULTS:
      Overall, there were 5,090 CD patients (57% women) of which 587 CD patients were
      </=20 years of age. The mean health-plan paid cost per member per year was
      $18,637 (s.d. $32,023) for all CD patients, $22,796 (s.d. $ 41,905) for CD
      patients </=20 years, and $18,095 (s.d. $30,065) for patients >20 years of age.
      Twenty-eight percent of CD patients accounted for 80% of total costs. No
      differences were found in costs based on gender. Increased health-plan paid costs
      were significantly correlated with the number of comorbid conditions across all
      ages. Pharmacy utilization costs account for nearly one-half (45.5%) of the total
      CD-attributable costs, exceeding inpatient care costs. Anti-TNF agents alone
      comprised nearly one-third (29.5%) of total costs. Aside from anti-TNF costs,
      other major categories of expense were as follows: inpatient 23.1%, outpatient
      hospital setting 15.7%, and MD office 8.2%. CONCLUSIONS: Total health-care costs 
      in CD exceed previous estimates, with the majority of costs being allocated to a 
      relatively small subgroup of patients. Pharmacy utilization costs, owing to
      anti-TNF use, result in increasing total health-care costs and currently exceed
      costs for inpatient care. Pragmatic strategies to encourage gastroenterologists
      in the best clinical practice of optimizing anti-TNF use-in particular for
      younger age patients and those with multiple comorbidities-are necessary to
      reduce avoidable pharmacy utilization and inpatient care costs.

TI  - Macrophage and dendritic cell subsets in IBD: ALDH+ cells are reduced in colon
      tissue of patients with ulcerative colitis regardless of inflammation.
PG  - 171-82
LID - 10.1038/mi.2015.48 [doi]
AB  - Disruption of the homeostatic balance of intestinal dendritic cells (DCs) and
      macrophages (MQs) may contribute to inflammatory bowel disease. We characterized 
      DC and MQ populations, including their ability to produce retinoic acid, in
      clinical material encompassing Crohn's ileitis, Crohn's colitis and ulcerative
      colitis (UC) as well as mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) draining these sites.
      Increased CD14(+)DR(int) MQs characterized inflamed intestinal mucosa while total
      CD141(+) or CD1c(+) DCs numbers were unchanged. However, CD103(+) DCs, including 
      CD141(+)CD103(+) and CD1c(+)CD103(+) DCs, were reduced in inflamed intestine. In 
      MLNs, two CD14(-) DC populations were identified: CD11c(int)HLADR(hi) and
      CD11c(hi)HLADR(int) cells. A marked increase of CD11c(hi)HLADR(int) DC,
      particularly DR(int)CD1c(+) DCs, characterized MLNs draining inflamed intestine. 
      The fraction of DC and MQ populations expressing aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)
      activity, reflecting retinoic acid synthesis, in UC colon, both in active disease
      and remission, were reduced compared to controls and inflamed Crohn's colon. In
      contrast, no difference in the frequency of ALDH(+) cells among blood precursors 
      was detected between UC patients and non-inflamed controls. This suggests that
      ALDH activity in myeloid cells in the colon of UC patients, regardless of whether
      the disease is active or in remission, is influenced by the intestinal
      environment.

TI  - Identification of an anti-inflammatory protein from Faecalibacterium prausnitzii,

PG  - 415-425
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2014-307649 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD)-associated dysbiosis is characterised by a loss 
      of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, whose culture supernatant exerts an
      anti-inflammatory effect both in vitro and in vivo. However, the chemical nature 
      of the anti-inflammatory compounds has not yet been determined. METHODS:
      Peptidomic analysis using mass spectrometry was applied to F. prausnitzii
      supernatant. Anti-inflammatory effects of identified peptides were tested in
      vitro directly on intestinal epithelial cell lines and on cell lines transfected 
      with a plasmid construction coding for the candidate protein encompassing these
      peptides. In vivo, the cDNA of the candidate protein was delivered to the gut by 
      recombinant lactic acid bacteria to prevent dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid
      (DNBS)-colitis in mice. RESULTS: The seven peptides, identified in the F.
      prausnitzii culture supernatants, derived from a single microbial
      anti-inflammatory molecule (MAM), a protein of 15 kDa, and comprising 53% of
      non-polar residues. This last feature prevented the direct characterisation of
      the putative anti-inflammatory activity of MAM-derived peptides. Transfection of 
      MAM cDNA in epithelial cells led to a significant decrease in the activation of
      the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB pathway with a dose-dependent effect. Finally, the
      use of a food-grade bacterium, Lactococcus lactis, delivering a plasmid encoding 
      MAM was able to alleviate DNBS-induced colitis in mice. CONCLUSIONS: A 15 kDa
      protein with anti-inflammatory properties is produced by F. prausnitzii, a
      commensal bacterium involved in CD pathogenesis. This protein is able to inhibit 
      the NF-kappaB pathway in intestinal epithelial cells and to prevent colitis in an
      animal model.

TI  - Siblings of patients with Crohn's disease exhibit a biologically relevant
      dysbiosis in mucosal microbial metacommunities.
PG  - 944-53
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2014-308896 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the existence of mucosal dysbiosis in siblings of
      patients with Crohn's disease (CD) using 454 pyrosequencing and to
      comprehensively characterise and determine the influence of genotypical and
      phenotypical factors, on that dysbiosis. Siblings of patients with CD have
      elevated risk of developing CD and display aspects of disease phenotype,
      including faecal dysbiosis. Whether the mucosal microbiota is disrupted in these 
      at-risk individuals is unknown. DESIGN: Rectal biopsy DNA was extracted from 21
      patients with quiescent CD, 17 of their healthy siblings and 19 unrelated healthy
      controls. Mucosal microbiota was analysed by 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing and
      were classified into core and rare species. Genotypical risk was determined using
      Illumina Immuno BeadChip, faecal calprotectin by ELISA and blood T-cell phenotype
      by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Core microbiota of both patients with CD and healthy 
      siblings was significantly less diverse than controls. Metacommunity profiling
      (Bray-Curtis (SBC) index) showed the sibling core microbial composition to be
      more similar to CD (SBC=0.70) than to healthy controls, whereas the sibling rare 
      microbiota was more similar to healthy controls (SBC=0.42). Faecalibacterium
      prausnitzii contributed most to core metacommunity dissimilarity both between
      siblings and controls, and between patients and controls. Phenotype/genotype
      markers of CD risk significantly influenced microbiota variation between and
      within groups, of which genotype had the largest effect. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals
      with elevated CD-risk display mucosal dysbiosis characterised by reduced
      diversity of core microbiota and lower abundance of F. prausnitzii. This
      dysbiosis in healthy people at risk of CD implicates microbiological processes in
      CD pathogenesis.

AB  - The Asia Pacific Working Group on Inflammatory Bowel Disease was established in
      Cebu, Philippines, at the Asia Pacific Digestive Week conference in 2006 under
      the auspices of the Asian Pacific Association of Gastroenterology (APAGE) with
      the goal of developing best management practices, coordinating research and
      raising awareness of IBD in the region. The consensus group previously published 
      recommendations for the diagnosis and management of ulcerative colitis (UC) with 
      specific relevance to the Asia-Pacific region. The present consensus statements
      were developed following a similar process to address the epidemiology, diagnosis
      and management of Crohn's disease (CD). The goals of these statements are to pool
      the pertinent literature specifically highlighting relevant data and conditions
      in the Asia-Pacific region relating to the economy, health systems, background
      infectious diseases, differential diagnoses and treatment availability. It does
      not intend to be all-comprehensive and future revisions are likely to be required
      in this ever-changing field.

TI  - Developing in vitro expanded CD45RA+ regulatory T cells as an adoptive cell
      therapy for Crohn's disease.
PG  - 584-94
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2014-306919 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Thymus-derived regulatory T cells (Tregs) mediate dominant
      peripheral tolerance and treat experimental colitis. Tregs can be expanded from
      patient blood and were safely used in recent phase 1 studies in graft versus host
      disease and type 1 diabetes. Treg cell therapy is also conceptually attractive
      for Crohn's disease (CD). However, barriers exist to this approach. The stability
      of Tregs expanded from Crohn's blood is unknown. The potential for adoptively
      transferred Tregs to express interleukin-17 and exacerbate Crohn's lesions is of 
      concern. Mucosal T cells are resistant to Treg-mediated suppression in active CD.
      The capacity for expanded Tregs to home to gut and lymphoid tissue is unknown.
      METHODS: To define the optimum population for Treg cell therapy in CD,
      CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(lo)CD45RA(+) and CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(lo)CD45RA(-) Treg subsets 
      were isolated from patients' blood and expanded in vitro using a workflow that
      can be readily transferred to a good manufacturing practice background. RESULTS: 
      Tregs can be expanded from the blood of patients with CD to potential target dose
      within 22-24 days. Expanded CD45RA(+) Tregs have an epigenetically stable FOXP3
      locus and do not convert to a Th17 phenotype in vitro, in contrast to CD45RA(-)
      Tregs. CD45RA(+) Tregs highly express alpha4beta7 integrin, CD62L and CC motif
      receptor 7 (CCR7). CD45RA(+) Tregs also home to human small bowel in a C.B-17
      severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) xenotransplant model. Importantly, in
      vitro expansion enhances the suppressive ability of CD45RA(+) Tregs. These cells 
      also suppress activation of lamina propria and mesenteric lymph node lymphocytes 
      isolated from inflamed Crohn's mucosa. CONCLUSIONS:
      CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(lo)CD45RA(+) Tregs may be the most appropriate population from
      which to expand Tregs for autologous Treg therapy for CD, paving the way for
      future clinical trials.

AB  - Diet may be a successful part of the treatment plan for improving outcome in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study aimed to
      systematically review all published clinical trials evaluating the effects of a
      regular diet on symptoms of IBD. Three medical databases were searched for
      clinical trials evaluating an intervention that involved dietary manipulation
      using a regular diet on adults with IBD whose symptoms were objectively measured 
      before and after the intervention. The most common types of regular diet
      interventions that we observed in the literature fell into the following three
      categories: low residue/low fiber diets, exclusion diets, or other specific
      diets. Of all included studies, the few that were of higher quality and that
      observed a statistically significant improvement in symptoms in the diet group
      compared to the control group fell under the exclusion diet group or the other
      specific diet group. We were able to identify several high quality clinical
      trials evaluating dietary manipulations on symptoms of IBD. Exclusion diets and
      the low FODMAP diet are two areas identified in this review that show promise for
      having therapeutic benefits for patients with IBD.

TI  - Making decisions about chronic disease treatment: a comparison of parents and
      their adolescent children.
PG  - 716-26
LID - 10.1111/hex.12210 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare factors considered by parents to those considered by
      adolescents making decisions about chronic disease treatments. METHODS: We
      conducted individual interviews with 15 parent-adolescent dyads in which the
      adolescent had either juvenile idiopathic arthritis or Crohn's disease. Questions
      focused on treatment decisions, with an emphasis on the factors that influenced
      each individual's preferences related to biologic therapies. A multidisciplinary 
      team developed a coding structure. All interviews were coded by two people with
      disagreements resolved through discussion. We used content analysis and coding
      matrices to examine decision factors within and between parent-adolescent dyads. 
      RESULTS: Parents and adolescents both participated in decisions about treatment
      with biologic therapies but considered decision factors differently. In only half
      of cases did parents and adolescents agree on the factor that most influenced
      their decision. Although their decision factors often fell into similar
      categories (e.g. treatment risks, quality of life), in many cases the specifics
      varied between adolescents and their parents. Adolescents were more likely to
      focus on immediate treatment effects and quality of life while parents took a
      longer term view of the decision. Agreement within dyads was most consistent when
      a special circumstance influenced the treatment decision. CONCLUSIONS:
      Differences regarding influential decision factors exist within parent-adolescent
      dyads. Continued research is needed to determine the extent to which such
      differences are due to individual preferences or to variations in the information
      available to each person. Future decision support interventions will need to
      address parents' and adolescents' potentially disparate views and information
      needs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's
      disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are susceptible to protein-calorie
      malnutrition secondary to decreased oral intake, malabsorption, and increased
      metabolic expenditure. In this study, we seek to assess the national frequencies 
      of parenteral nutrition (PN) use among hospitalized patients with IBD and to
      determine their in-hospital outcomes. METHODS: We analyzed the Nationwide
      Inpatient Sample from 1988-2006 to determine the frequency of PN usage among
      patients with UC or CD and to determine their in-hospital outcomes. A
      multivariate analysis was performed to identify factors predictive of increased
      inpatient mortality in this population. RESULTS: From 1988-2006, the annual
      incidence of PN use among hospitalized patients with CD was 4.29 per 100,000 and 
      among those with UC was 3.80 per 100,000, with trends being relatively stable
      through the indexed period. The mean length of hospitalization among patients
      with UC receiving PN was longer compared with patients with CD. Factors
      predictive of an increased risk for mortality include the following: age >50
      years, acute kidney injury, hospital-acquired pneumonia, Clostridium difficile
      colitis, prolonged postoperative ileus requiring PN use, pulmonary embolism,
      malnutrition, and patients with UC relative to CD. CONCLUSION: Traditionally,
      patients with CD are at a higher risk for developing malnutrition than patients
      with UC; however, there is a 2-fold higher risk for inpatient mortality and a
      longer length of hospitalization among patients with UC compared with those with 
      CD. This pattern suggests that the use of PN, particularly among patients with
      UC, serves as a surrogate marker of higher disease acuity and severity.
