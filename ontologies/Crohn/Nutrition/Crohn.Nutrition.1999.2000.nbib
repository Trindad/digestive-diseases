AB  - Corticosteroids and the 5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA) drugs still constitute the
      mainstays of therapy, with azatioprine/mercaptopurine an established second-line 
      agent for resistant disease. Primarily nutritional therapy has a place for some
      patients with Crohn's disease, and alternative immunosupressants are finding
      their own disease. The medical management of inflammatory bowel diseases is
      poised to enter to new era if the current promise shown by investigatory
      immunomodulatory regimes translates into confirmed effective therapy.

TI  - [Oral nutritional supplements. Are they useful?].
PG  - 49-57
AB  - Oral nutritional supplements are products included in enteral nutrition,
      preferably used in hospital settings, although their use in the community is
      gradually increasing and in the United Kingdom has doubled in the last seven
      years, with prescriptions covering a wide range of the population from children
      to the elderly, and different pathologies affecting their nutritional status.
      There is, however, no consensus on the usefulness of oral nutritional supplements
      among these patients, so we do not have any recommendations for use. In this
      paper we have reviewed the various studies available in the literature in order
      to clarify the usefulness of these supplements in different contexts or
      pathologies.

TI  - Oral nutritional supplementation is effective in the maintenance of remission in 
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 769-74
AB  - BACKGROUND: Enteral feeding with either elemental or polymeric diets is an
      established primary therapy for active Crohn's disease. However, the role of
      supplementing normal food with elemental diet in the long-term management of
      Crohn's disease has hitherto not been explored. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A series of
      39 consecutive patients with Crohn's disease in clinical remission were studied. 
      Of these, 21 patients (Group 1) received oral nutritional supplementation, taken 
      in addition to their normal diet. Their outcome (relapse rate, Crohn's disease
      activity index, inflammatory markers) was compared with that of 18 patients
      (Group 2), who were maintained on a normal unrestricted diet over an observation 
      period of 12 months. RESULTS: A total of 17 patients (81%) tolerated the
      nutritional supplementation. On an intention-to-treat basis, 10 patients (48%)
      remained in remission for 12 months, compared to 4/18 (22%) patients in Group 2, 
      p<0.0003. Their Crohn's disease activity index and CRP remained stable while
      their weight and body mass index improved during the period of nutrition therapy 
      Seven patients in Group 1 and 14 in Group 2 relapsed at a mean of 7.4+/-0.9 and
      6.2+/-0.4 months, respectively. The response to nutrition supplement was
      independent of age, sex, disease duration or location. Four patients (19%) were
      intolerant to enteral feeding. CONCLUSIONS: Nutritional supplementation is safe, 
      well tolerated and effective in the long-term management of patients with
      quiescent Crohn's disease.

TI  - Inflammatory disease and outcome of short bowel syndrome.
PG  - 551-4; discussion 554-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: The outcome of the short bowel syndrome (SBS) is influenced by
      several factors including intestinal disease, remnant length and location, the
      other digestive organs, and intestinal adaptation. Because underlying
      inflammatory disease might influence several of these, the aim of this study was 
      to evaluate the outcome of SBS in inflammatory conditions. METHODS: A total of
      106 adult patients with SBS evaluated over a 20-year period were studied. Thirty 
      (28%) patients had either Crohn's disease (n = 10) or radiation enteritis (n =
      20). RESULTS: Multiple resections were more common in the inflammatory group (57%
      versus 12%, P <0.05.) These patients had longer intestinal remnants but the type 
      of colonic remnant and the presence of an ileal remnant, the ileocecal junction
      and a stoma was similar in both groups. A similar proportion of patients in both 
      groups required parenteral nutrition (PN) in the first year (73% versus 68%).
      Patients with inflammatory conditions were less likely to require PN after the
      first year (33% versus 63%; P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Patients with SBS resulting from
      inflammatory disease appear to have a better nutritional prognosis after the
      first year. While they are more likely to have had multiple resections and
      develop SBS with longer remnant length, inflammatory disease itself is an
      important prognostic factor. This may be related to resolution of inflammatory
      disease or a greater adaptive response.

TI  - Laparoscopic-assisted surgery for Crohn's disease: reduced surgical stress
      following ileocolectomy.
PG  - 219-22
AB  - Recent progress in laparoscopic techniques has enabled operations for various
      intestinal disorders to be performed under laparoscopic assistance. This study
      was conducted to assess the benefits of performing laparoscopic-assisted surgery 
      (LAS) in patients with Crohn's disease. LAS was performed in 24 selected patients
      with Crohn's disease, most of whom underwent ileocolic resection for ileitis
      and/or colitis with stenosis. To determine the benefits of LAS, the postoperative
      inflammatory parameters of these patients were examined and compared with those
      of 17 patients who underwent conventional open surgery. Despite giving all
      patients total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for more than 2 weeks preoperatively,
      two patients with large inflammatory masses involving enteroenteric fistulas
      required conversion to laparotomy. No laparoscopic procedure was converted for
      adhesions after previous resection or intraoperative complications. The maximum
      C-reactive protein values and body temperatures were significantly lower, and the
      time taken to normalize body temperature and leukocyte counts was significantly
      shorter in the LAS group than in the laparotomy group. LAS should be performed
      for patients with Crohn's disease in the inactive phase after appropriate
      nutritional support. Patients with terminal ileitis without a fistula are
      considered to have the highest indication for this procedure.

AB  - Recent developments concerning nutritional complications of inflammatory bowel
      disease include a better understanding of disease-associated anorexia and
      increasing recognition of the interaction of nutrition and cytokines in the
      pathogenesis of growth impairment of children. Decreased bone mineral density is 
      a multifactorial complication and an increased focus of research. Enteral
      nutrition continues to play an important role in the therapy of Crohn's disease. 
      The mechanisms whereby specific nutrients, such as n-3 fatty acids, antioxidants,
      and butyrate, ameliorate inflammation are being elucidated in in-vitro studies,
      but beneficial effects have yet to be translated into the clinical sphere.

TI  - Growth after intestinal resection for Crohn's disease in children, adolescents,
      and young adults.
PG  - 265-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Growth before and after intestinal resection for Crohn's disease (CD) 
      was examined in a group of children, adolescents, and young adults. METHODS:
      Retrospective chart review of patients who had intestinal resections as clinical 
      management of complications of CD between 1985 and 1996. Pre- and postoperative
      measurements of weight and height were reviewed. Z-scores were computed for
      weight-forage (WAZ), height-for-age (HAZ), and weight-for-height (WHZ). Two
      tailed t tests were used to compare postoperative growth patterns. Significance
      was defined as p < 0.05. RESULTS: Twenty-five subjects (8 females, mean age
      16.2+/-2.8 years with one operation, and 3 males, mean age 15.7 years with
      multiple operations) were identified. There were significant improvements in the 
      postoperative growth patterns of subjects who had one operation: HAZ
      (-1.28+/-1.45 versus -0.98+/-1.37, p = 0.041), WAZ (-1.35+/-1.02 versus
      -0.74+/-0.93, p = 0.0006) and WHZ (-0.64+/-0.95 versus -0.23+/-0.81, p = 0.036). 
      Furthermore, the magnitude of postoperative weight gain directly correlated with 
      the age at CD diagnosis, R2 = 0.16, p = 0.046. Trends towards improved
      postoperative WAZ (-0.83 versus -0.49) and HAZ (-0.47 versus -0.27) were also
      observed in the three subjects who had multiple operations. CONCLUSION: The
      pattern of weight and height growth was improved after intestinal resection for
      CD. Nonetheless, close monitoring of postoperative growth is necessary especially
      in children diagnosed with CD at a young age.

TI  - Granulomatous osteonecrosis in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 951-4
AB  - A 25-year-old white woman was diagnosed with Crohn's disease involving the small 
      and large intestines. She had a complex clinical course that required treatment
      with multiple pharmacological agents, including intravenous, oral and rectal
      corticosteroids. She also received parenteral nutrition with lipid emulsions.
      Finally, repeated intestinal resections and drainage of perianal abscesses were
      required. Her disease was complicated by gallstones, urolithiasis and hip pain.
      After osteonecrosis was diagnosed, joint replacements were performed. Review of
      the pathological sections from the resected hip, however, resulted in detection
      of granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells - the histological 
      'footprint' of Crohn's disease in the gastrointestinal tract. Because prior
      specialized perfusion fixation pathological studies of the intestine in Crohn's
      disease have shown that granulomas are located in the walls of blood vessels, a
      possible mechanism for the pathogenesis of osteonecrosis in Crohn's disease is
      chronic microvascular ischemia of bone.

TI  - Oral tacrolimus treatment of severe colitis in children.
PG  - 794-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of oral tacrolimus as an induction agent in
      steroid-refractory severe colitis. STUDY DESIGN: Open-label, multicenter trial of
      oral tacrolimus in patients with severe colitis. Patients not responding to
      conventional therapy received tacrolimus, 0.1 mg/kg/dose given twice a day, and
      the dosage was adjusted to achieve blood levels between 10 and 15 ng/mL. Response
      was defined as improvement in a number of clinical parameters (including
      abdominal pain, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, and cessation of transfusions).
      Patients who responded by 14 days continued to receive tacrolimus, and
      6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine was added as a steroid-sparing agent 4 to 6
      weeks after the tacrolimus was instituted. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were
      enrolled in the study. One patient elected to withdraw after 48 hours. Of the 13 
      remaining, 9 (69%) responded and were discharged. Tacrolimus was continued for 2 
      to 3 months in the responders, except for 1 patient who was given tacrolimus for 
      11 months. After 1 year of follow-up, only 5 (38%) patients were receiving
      maintenance therapy; the other 4 responders had undergone colectomy. CONCLUSION: 
      Although tacrolimus is effective induction therapy for severe ulcerative or
      Crohn's colitis, fewer than 50% of patients treated will successfully achieve a
      long-term remission.

TI  - Doppler US in patients with crohn disease: vessel density in the diseased bowel
      reflects disease activity.
PG  - 787-91
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine if neovascularization associated with Crohn disease, as
      detected with Doppler ultrasonography (US), reflects clinical disease activity.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A devised measurement, vessel density, was estimated with 
      color Doppler US. Patients with Crohn disease underwent clinical and laboratory
      assessment in which the Crohn disease activity index was measured; patients
      underwent abdominal US the same week. Color Doppler US was performed by using a
      7.5-10.0- or 8.0-12.0-MHz transducer, the lowest possible pulse repetition
      frequency without aliasing, a low wall filter, and high Doppler gain settings.
      The length and thickness of the affected loops were measured, and the number of
      color Doppler signals per square centimeter in the bowel loop was counted. Pulsed
      Doppler US was used to confirm that the signals originated from arteries or veins
      and not from movement artifacts. RESULTS: Ninety-two patients (aged 7-20 years;
      mean, 14.85 years; 44 female, 48 male) underwent 119 examinations; 85 were
      performed in patients with active disease. Affected loops were thicker (10.6 vs
      4. 6 mm; P: <.001) and had a higher vessel density with disease (69 of 119
      examinations) than during remission (two of 34 examinations; P: <.001).
      CONCLUSION: Vessel density in affected bowel loops, as estimated with Doppler US,
      and bowel wall thickness (>5 mm) reflect disease activity in patients with Crohn 
      disease.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 747-56
AB  - Till about 3 decades ago, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was considered as
      non-existent in our country. However, since that time several reports of IBD,
      mainly ulcerative colitis have been published. More recently, Crohn's disease is 
      also being reported from the country. This trend of UC appearing first in a
      population followed by CD also appears to be true in other developing nations. A 
      substantial increase in the rates of CD over UC in the last few decades is
      reported from developed nations as well. Of the other epidemiological factors, an
      increased risk of CD and lower risk of UC in smokers is established in adults.
      However, it appears that smoking increases the risk of IBD in children. The
      etiology of IBD remains elusive. Within the triad of genetics, immunity and
      antigen responsible for the development of IBD, maximum advances have been made
      in the field of immune aberrations and this is being exploited to treat the
      disease. It is well established that IBD results from a disordered immune system 
      in the gut, in response to an unidentified antigen in a predisposed individual.
      The immune response is enhanced and revolves around antigen-presenting cells, CD 
      4 T-lymphocytes and tumor necrosis factor alpha. CD results from an enhanced Th1 
      activity. The pathogenesis of UC is less clear but appears to be humoral.
      Advances in diagnostics include the availability of serology, ultrasound and
      nuclear scans, none of which have been tried in our setting where infectious
      diseases and tuberculosis is rampant. Growth failure and the importance of
      nutrition in IBD, especially CD, cannot be underemphasized. In many situations
      nutritional interventions have been used solely as a form of therapy for CD.
      Newer steroid molecules with minimal systemic effects are also being considered. 
      Other treatment options highlighted are the use of immunosuppressive agents,
      biologic agents and role of surgery.

TI  - Prolonged duration of response to infliximab in early but not late pediatric
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 3189-94
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha plays a central role in chronic
      intestinal inflammation of Crohn's disease. Targeting this cytokine with the
      chimeric monoclonal antibody infliximab has emerged as an effective form of
      therapy in adult Crohn's disease patients. We sought to determine whether
      infliximab treatment would benefit pediatric patients with medically refractory
      Crohn's disease. We also assessed the duration of response, comparing children
      with early disease to children with long-standing (late) Crohn's disease.
      METHODS: Fifteen consecutive children (mean age 12.8 +/- 3.2 yr) with medically
      refractory Crohn's disease were enrolled in a prospective, open-label trial of a 
      single, 5-mg/kg infliximab intravenous infusion. Medically refractory disease was
      defined as an inability to taper steroids, lack of response to immunomodulator
      therapy over 4 months, and active disease as measured by the Pediatric Crohn's
      Disease Activity Index (PCDAI). Primary endpoints included measurements of
      disease activity (PCDAI), steroid use, and duration of clinical response.
      RESULTS: In all, 14/15 children (94%) improved after infliximab infusion, with a 
      significant decrease of both PCDAI and daily steroid use by 4 wk. Ten patients
      (67%) achieved complete remission by 10 wk. Among the 14 patients who responded, 
      three of six children (50%) with early disease maintained clinical response
      through the 12-month trial period, compared to none of eight children with late
      disease. There were no serious complications associated with the use of
      infliximab in any of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab is safe and effective 
      in the short-term treatment of medically refractory pediatric Crohn's disease.
      More importantly, there is a remarkably prolonged duration of response after
      infliximab therapy in children with early compared to late Crohn's disease.

TI  - The safe use of percutaneous gastrostomy for enteral nutrition in patients with
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1089-93
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)
      tube placement for nutritional support and/or defined therapeutic enteral
      nutrition (TEN) in adult patients with Crohn's disease. DESIGN: A prospective,
      observational study of patients with Crohn's disease in whom PEG tubes were
      placed for nutritional support or TEN. SETTING: A specialist nutrition clinic at 
      a gastroenterology tertiary referral centre in Harrow, UK. PARTICIPANTS: Nine
      patients with Crohn's disease. Seven patients had nutritional failure and were
      unable to tolerate nasogastric feeding, and two patients were recruited in whom
      TEN therapy for active disease was indicated. The age range was 21-52 years
      (median, 30 years). Five patients were female; all had had previous ileo-colonic 
      resections, one had a gastro-enterostomy and one had a non-healing
      Crohn's-related gastric ulcer. INTERVENTIONS: PEG insertion (Fresenius, Frecka 9 
      Fr) was performed at endoscopy with intravenous sedation. Follow-up with tubes in
      situ was for a median of 37 weeks (range, 4-276 weeks), and for a further median 
      of 80 weeks (range, 52-120 weeks) in those whose tubes have been removed. MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURES: The level of disease activity, nutritional status/body mass
      index and any complications associated with PEG tube placement were recorded.
      RESULTS: PEG was achieved in all patients; the only complication was a minor
      superficial entry site infection. Five patients continue to use PEG feeding to
      good effect, including healing of the Crohn's-associated ulcer. One patient now
      eats normally having regained target weight, and three require parenteral
      nutrition, having failed to achieve nutritional sufficiency despite an optimal
      enteral regimen via the PEG. An adverse body image in one of these patients (an
      opiate abuser with a long psychiatric history) was probably contributory to PEG
      failure. There was no peristomal or fistulous disease. CONCLUSIONS: Although
      nutrition via PEG is not always successful, failures are of enteral nutrition,
      and not of the means. PEG use in selected patients with Crohn's disease appears
      safe and can prove a useful addition to therapeutic options.

TI  - Gastrostomy placement in patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1073-5
AB  - Crohn's disease often involves the stomach, yet a permanent enterocutaneous
      fistula does not usually occur, after a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is
      removed from a patient with Crohn's disease. This is because the factors that are
      related to the non-closure of a fistula are absent or have been treated (distal
      bowel obstruction, abdominal sepsis, undernutrition, poor gastric blood supply or
      abnormal serum levels of C-reactive protein and albumin). Gastric involvement in 
      patients with Crohn's disease is common. Enterocutaneous fistulas from the
      stomach are rare. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) insertion and
      subsequent removal rarely cause problems in patients with Crohn's disease.
      Endoscopic removal of a PEG is advised in patients with Crohn's disease. Steroids
      may delay gastric adhesion to the anterior abdominal wall.

TI  - Is lactobacillus GG helpful in children with Crohn's disease? Results of a
      preliminary, open-label study.
PG  - 453-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactobacillus GG is a safe probiotic bacterium known to transiently
      colonize the human intestine. It has been found to be useful in treatment of
      several gastrointestinal conditions characterized by increased gut permeability. 
      In the current study, the efficacy of Lactobacillus GG was investigated in
      children with Crohn's disease. METHODS: In this open-label pilot evaluation
      viewed as a necessary preliminary step for a possible subsequent randomized
      placebo-controlled trial, four children with mildly to moderately active Crohn's 
      disease were given Lactobacillus GG (10(10) colony-forming units [CFU]) in
      enterocoated tablets twice a day for 6 months. Changes in intestinal permeability
      were measured by a double sugar permeability test. Clinical activity was
      determined by measuring the pediatric Crohn's disease activity index. RESULTS:
      There was a significant improvement in clinical activity 1 week after starting
      Lactobacillus GG, which was sustained throughout the study period. Median
      pediatric Crohn's disease activity index scores at 4 weeks were 73% lower than
      baseline. Intestinal permeability improved in an almost parallel fashion.
      CONCLUSIONS: Findings in this pilot study show that Lactobacillus GG may improve 
      gut barrier function and clinical status in children with mildly to moderately
      active, stable Crohn's disease. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      trials are warranted for a final assessment of the efficacy of Lactobacillus GG
      in Crohn's disease.

AB  - Perianal Crohn's diseases (PCD) means perianal skin lesions, affection of anal
      canal and onset of fistula-in-ano. These manifestations are present in 10-82 per 
      cent of patients suffered from the Crohn's disease (CD). Fistula-in-ano is the
      most serious complications which significantly threaten a quality of life.
      Contemporary treatment of this kind of fistula-in-ano includes administration of 
      immunosuppressive drugs, steroids, antimycotics and combination of enteral and
      parenteral nutrition, with long term local treatment. Successful results are
      obtained in 40-80%.

TI  - Butyrate inhibits inflammatory responses through NFkappaB inhibition:
      implications for Crohn's disease.
PG  - 397-403
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Proinflammatory cytokines are key factors in the pathogenesis of 
      Crohn's disease (CD). Activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB), which is
      involved in their gene transcription, is increased in the intestinal mucosa of CD
      patients. As butyrate enemas may be beneficial in treating colonic inflammation, 
      we investigated if butyrate promotes this effect by acting on proinflammatory
      cytokine expression. METHODS: Intestinal biopsy specimens, isolated lamina
      propria cells (LPMC), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were cultured
      with or without butyrate for assessment of secretion of tumour necrosis factor
      (TNF) and mRNA levels. NFkappaB p65 activation was determined by
      immunofluorescence and gene reporter experiments. Levels of NFkappaB inhibitory
      protein (IkappaBalpha) were analysed by western blotting. The in vivo efficacy of
      butyrate was assessed in rats with trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS) induced 
      colitis. RESULTS: Butyrate decreased TNF production and proinflammatory cytokine 
      mRNA expression by intestinal biopsies and LPMC from CD patients. Butyrate
      abolished lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced expression of cytokines by PBMC and
      transmigration of NFkappaB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. LPS induced
      NFkappaB transcriptional activity was decreased by butyrate while IkappaBalpha
      levels were stable. Butyrate treatment also improved TNBS induced colitis.
      CONCLUSIONS: Butyrate decreases proinflammatory cytokine expression via
      inhibition of NFkappaB activation and IkappaBalpha degradation. These
      anti-inflammatory properties provide a rationale for assessing butyrate in the
      treatment of CD.

TI  - Therapy of Crohn's disease in childhood.
PG  - 193-203
AB  - Crohn's disease in childhood is a chronic relapsing condition with a high
      morbidity. Growth failure is common. The aim of therapy is to induce and then
      maintain disease remission and thereby promote well-being and normal growth and
      development. Enteral nutrition (either polymeric or elemental) is effective and
      used as initial therapy. This is employed as sole therapy over a 6- to 8-week
      period followed by a period of controlled food reintroduction. The relapse rate
      is high and further courses of enteral nutrition or alternative therapies are
      frequently required. Corticosteroids are also effective as initial therapy and
      are required in difficult cases but there are problems with their long term use, 
      particularly their adverse effects on growth. Many patients develop either
      corticosteroid-dependent or corticosteroid-resistant disease. In this instance,
      additional immunosuppression, such as azathioprine, can be used. Surgery is
      required for those patients with disease resistant to medical therapy and this
      will result in remission; however, the relapse rate with surgery is high. There
      are many areas for future research. Very little is known about why enteral
      nutrition works, how long it should be given or its role as maintenance therapy. 
      Newer immunosuppressive strategies based on cytokine modulation may be helpful in
      children once more experience is gained from their use in adults.

      affective symptoms, mainly high degree of neurosis and depressions, was detected 
      with the use of psychological methods. Social relations and status may influence 
      the course of the disease. Social support, information on the disease and
      patients higher educational degree have positive effects on the acceptation and
      compliance of the disease. Surprisingly negatively is the disease influenced by
      stable partnership and parenthood. Affective symptoms can be managed with the use
      of psychological methods. We proved it on reconditioning stays with structured
      programme. Their application led to reduction of neurotic and depressive
      symptoms, improvement of physical condition, better ability to relax physically
      and emotionally, the ability to harmonize psychical and physical functions, to
      cope with stress and the patients have established social contacts with other
      persons suffering from the same disease with the aim to promote conscious care of
      one's own health condition. Psycho-educational programme is extraordinary
      important in new diagnosed patients, for their ability to cope with the disease, 
      and as a help for their future life arrangement. The techniques used to deal with
      stress can be helpful for prolonging the remission period. It was confirmed that 
      psychological methods may contribute to life quality improvement in Crohn's
      disease patients. Self-help activities in the form of clubs and reconditioning
      stays reveal as very useful. Psycho-social intervention should become a part of
      complex care of patients with Crohn's disease. (Tab. 1, Fig. 1, Ref. 22.)

TI  - Inducible nitric oxide synthase activity in colon biopsies from inflammatory
      areas: correlation with inflammation intensity in patients with ulcerative
      colitis but not with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 229-37
AB  - Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activities are responsible for the enzymatic
      conversion of L-arginine into NO and L-citrulline. Relatively low amounts of NO
      are produced in intestinal epithelial cells or are released from nerve endings.
      The effects of NO production are related to the maintenance of epithelial
      integrity and permeability. A pathological role of an increased NO production has
      been suggested to play a role in models of experimental colitis. In humans, NOS
      activity in colon mucosa from patients with ulcerative colitis is clearly
      increased when compared with the activity of the control group. In contrast, an
      increase of NOS activity in the colon mucosa from patients with Crohn's disease
      remains controversial. In the present work, we have measured NOS activity in
      colon biopsies originating from the control group (n = 16), from patients with
      ulcerative colitis (n = 23) and Crohn's disease (n = 17) using the radiochemical 
      method of the conversion of L-[guanido-14C] arginine into radioactive
      L-citrulline. In the control group, NOS activity was mainly of the inducible type
      (88% of total NOS activity) since it was characterised by its insensibility to
      the absence of calcium in the assay medium. In colon biopsies originating from
      patients with ulcerative colitis, inducible NOS activity was increased 3 fold (p 
      < 0.005) and in patients with Crohn's disease, inducible NOS activity was
      increased 5 fold (p < 0.005). Correlations between NOS activity in colon biopsies
      and the intensity parameters of the disease i.e. Truelove index, endoscopic score
      and histological parameters were evidenced in patients with ulcerative colitis.
      In contrast, in patients with Crohn's disease, the high inducible NOS activity
      was not correlated with any intensity parameters of the disease. From these data,
      we concluded that although inducible NOS activity was increased several fold in
      colon biopsies originating from patients with both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
      disease, a correlation between this activity and the severity of bowel
      inflammation was not found in either cases.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine growth, body composition, and nutritional status in a large
      sample of children, adolescents, and young adults with Crohn's disease (CD).
      METHODS: One hundred thirty-two subjects (48 females) with CD, aged 5 to 25
      years, and 66 healthy control subjects (37 females) of similar age. Growth,
      nutritional status, and body composition were measured by anthropometry and
      dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Genetic potential of linear growth was
      predicted using the adjusted heights of Himes et al. Pubertal status and skeletal
      age were assessed. Average Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) and
      lifetime steroid exposure (in milligrams per day) were obtained from medical
      charts. The variables were examined in relation to gender and measures of disease
      activity. RESULTS: Males and females with CD did not differ by age, disease
      duration, or PCDAI. Males with CD had significantly lower values for growth and
      nutritional status than control subjects (z-scores for weight: -0.66 +/- 1.18 vs.
      0.26 +/- 0.95, P = 0.00002; height -0.81 +/- 1.14 vs. 0.28 +/- 0.93, P = 0.00001;
      adjusted height -1.05 +/- 1.03 vs. 0.40 +/- 1.03, P = 0.00001) and delayed
      skeletal age of 0.9 +/- 1.6 years. Impaired linear growth in the males was
      present regardless of pubertal stage. Associations between disease severity
      indicators and growth parameters were more consistent for females. CONCLUSIONS:
      Crohn's disease is associated with impaired growth. Despite similarities in
      disease duration, activity, and lifetime steroid exposure, growth in males was
      more impaired. Gender may confer risk for impaired growth in CD.

TI  - Enteral nutrition and corticosteroids in the treatment of acute Crohn's disease
      in children.
PG  - 8-15
AB  - BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment of acute Crohn's disease in children remains
      controversial. In adults, steroid therapy has been shown to be superior to
      exclusive enteral nutrition. However, enteral nutrition is effective at inducing 
      a remission in many children with acute Crohn's disease. Steroid usage in
      children has been associated with adverse side effects, particularly with delayed
      growth and pubertal development. METHODS: Randomized clinical trials comparing
      exclusive enteral nutrition with corticosteroids were identified. Two independent
      reviewers extracted data from selected studies. Studies were assessed for
      heterogeneity and relative risks for remission induction with enteral nutrition
      were obtained. Sensitivity analyses were performed in partially randomized
      studies. Estimates were made of the number of studies needed to overturn the
      current result. Other outcome measures were qualitatively assessed. RESULTS: In
      five randomized clinical trials comprising 147 patients, enteral nutrition was as
      effective as corticosteroids at inducing a remission (RR = 0.95 [95% confidence
      interval 0.67, 1.34]). Addition of two further nonrandomized trials did not
      significantly alter the result. A minimum of 10 further studies, equal in size
      and outcome to the largest reported pediatric trial to date (n = 68, RR = 0.84), 
      would be required to demonstrate a significant benefit of steroid therapy over
      enteral nutrition. CONCLUSIONS: There is no difference in efficacy between
      enteral nutrition and corticosteroid therapy in the treatment of acute Crohn's
      disease in children. Improved growth and development, without the side effects of
      steroid therapy, make enteral nutrition a better choice for first-line therapy in
      children with active Crohn's disease.

TI  - Comprehensive nutritional status in recently diagnosed patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease compared with population controls.
PG  - 514-21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Malnutrition is observed frequently in patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD). Knowledge of the nutritional status in patients with
      recently diagnosed IBD is limited. The aim of this study was to establish a
      comprehensive picture of the nutritional status in recently diagnosed IBD
      patients. SUBJECTS: Sixty-nine IBD patients (23 Crohn's disease (CD) and 46 with 
      ulcerative colitis (UC)) within 6 months of diagnosis and 69 age- and sex-matched
      population controls were included in the study. METHODS: The nutritional status
      was assessed by: (1) body composition (anthropometry and dual-energy X-ray
      absorptiometry); (2) dietary intake (dietary history); (3) biochemical indexes of
      nutrition; and (4) muscle strength (isokinetic dynamometer). RESULTS: Body weight
      and body mass index were significantly lower in UC patients compared with
      controls. The mean daily intake of carbohydrates was significantly higher in CD
      patients and the intakes of protein, calcium, phosphorus, and riboflavin were
      significantly lower in UC patients compared with controls, respectively. Serum
      concentrations of several nutrients (beta-carotene, magnesium, selenium and zinc)
      were significantly lower in UC patients compared with controls. Serum vitamin B12
      concentration was significantly lower in CD patients. Muscle strength did not
      significantly differ between IBD patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study
      showed that the nutritional status of IBD patients was already affected
      negatively at time of diagnosis. It needs to be elucidated whether nutritional
      supplementation in recently diagnosed IBD patients may improve the clinical
      course of the disease.

TI  - Normal thiopurine methyltransferase levels do not eliminate 6-mercaptopurine or
      azathioprine toxicity in children with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 409-13
AB  - 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and azathioprine (AZA) are used to treat inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD). Side effects include infection, leukopenia, hepatitis, and
      pancreatitis. The level of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), which metabolizes
      6-MP to 6-methylmercaptopurine, may reflect the risk of side effects. We sought
      to evaluate the relationship between the side effects of these medications and
      the TPMT level of pediatric patients with IBD. The medical records of our
      patients who were diagnosed with IBD and who received 6-MP or AZA were reviewed
      for measured TPMT levels. All red blood cell (RBC) TPMT levels were determined at
      the Mayo Medical Laboratories, Rochester, MN. The occurrence of leukopenia,
      elevated aminotransferases, and pancreatitis was evaluated. Twenty-two patients, 
      mean age 13.7 years, received 6-MP or AZA and had TPMT levels measured. The TPMT 
      levels ranged 10.7-27.5 U/mL RBC with a mean of 17.2 +/- 3.2 U/mL RBC. Two
      children had levels below the accepted norm of 13.8 U/mL RBC. One of these
      patients (50%) developed both elevation of aminotransferases and leukopenia. Of
      all, 20 children had normal levels, 3 (15.0%) exhibited side effects: hepatitis
      (n = 2) and leukopenia (n = 1). We conclude that side effects of 6-MP or AZA
      occur despite normal TPMT levels.

TI  - Early perioperative results and surgical recurrence after strictureplasty and
      miniresection for complicated Crohn's disease.
PG  - 261-7
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Strictureplasty (SP) or miniresective 'bowel-sparing' techniques
      (MR) can prevent the risk of intestinal stomia and short bowel syndrome in
      patients affected by Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this study was to analyze
      the perioperative morbidity and mortality in 104 of 138 consecutive patients
      treated for CD complications using bowel-sparing techniques. We also considered
      the factors that may be related to the risk of perioperative complications and
      the long-term outcome. METHODS: One hundred and four patients were treated with
      SP and/or MR and then included in a prospectively maintained database. The
      factors claimed to influence perioperative complications were analyzed using
      Fisher's exact test for categorical observations and the Mann-Whitney U test for 
      continuous variables. A multivariate analysis, using logistic regression, and a
      long-term time-to-event analysis using the Kaplan-Meier function, were also
      performed. RESULTS: Perioperative mortality was nil. In relation to the 6
      postoperative complications (5.8%), 4 patients underwent minimal bowel resection 
      (MR), 1 a MR with SP, and 1 SP alone. Three of these patients (2.9%) needed
      reoperation for septic complications, and 3 (2.9%) were treated as outpatients
      for enterocutaneous fistulas. A correlation (p < 0.05) was found between low
      serum hemoglobin levels and postoperative complications at univariate and
      multivariate analyses. The 5-year surgical recurrence-free rate was 75% overall, 
      73% for patients treated with SP, 78% with MR, and 77% with MR + SP. CONCLUSIONS:
      Postoperative complications are not related to conservative or miniresective
      surgery even when active disease is present at the resection margins or the site 
      of SP. The higher risk reported for patients with low serum hemoglobin and
      hematocrit levels suggests that surgeons should consider using preoperative iron 
      and vitamin support, parenteral nutrition and erythropoietin therapy, when
      necessary, in those cases. Our postoperative morbidity, mortality and long-term
      surgical recurrence rate results support the efficacy and safety of SP and MR
      surgery in the treatment of complicated CD.

TI  - Imbalance of stromelysin-1 and TIMP-1 in the mucosal lesions of children with
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 57-62
AB  - BACKGROUND: Degradation of the extracellular matrix and ulceration of the mucosa 
      are major features of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). One of the most important
      enzymes in degrading the matrix and produced in excess by cytokine activated
      stromal cells, is stromelysin-1. The activity of stromelysin-1 is controlled by
      tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP-1), its natural inhibitor. In model
      systems excess stromelysin-1 produces mucosal degradation. METHODS: Quantitative 
      competitive RT-PCR was used to analyse stromelysin-1 and TIMP-1 transcripts;
      western blotting was used to measure the amount of stromelysin-1 and TIMP-1
      protein in biopsy samples from children with IBD. RESULTS: In biopsies from
      patients with active Crohn's disease (n=24), ulcerative colitis (n=23), and
      controls (n=16), TIMP-1 transcripts and protein were abundant and unchanged.
      Stromelysin-1 transcripts and protein were markedly elevated in mucosal biopsies 
      obtained from inflamed sites of patients with active IBD but were not elevated in
      adjacent endoscopically normal mucosa (n=10). Elevated levels of stromelysin-1
      transcripts in active Crohn's disease (n=5) returned to normal levels following
      treatment with enteral nutrition. CONCLUSIONS: Stromelysin-1 is markedly
      overexpressed at inflamed sites in patients with IBD whereas TIMP-1 remains
      unaltered. Excess stromelysin-1 is likely to be responsible for loss of mucosal
      integrity in IBD.

TI  - Treatment of esophageal Crohn's disease by enteral feeding via percutaneous
      endoscopic gastrostomy.
PG  - 176-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease of the esophagus is rare, and medical treatment often
      ineffective. Complications such as abscess and fistula may arise, and the
      morbidity of surgery is high. METHODS: Two cases of refractory esophageal Crohn's
      disease were confirmed by endoscopy and biopsy. Percutaneous endoscopic
      gastrostomies (PEGs) were inserted and used for enteral nutrition for 9 and 1
      month, respectively. RESULTS: The PEGs were well tolerated. Symptoms subsided
      rapidly, and later gastroscopies confirmed healing of the esophageal ulcers. No
      complications occurred, and the gastrostomy sites closed quickly after removal of
      the tubes, with minimal scarring. CONCLUSIONS: Enteral feeding via PEG appears to
      be safe and well tolerated and may be of great value in the management not only
      of esophageal Crohn's disease but also of refractory disease at other sites.

TI  - Probiotics and inflammatory bowel disease: is there a scientific rationale?
PG  - 107-15
AB  - Most conventional forms of drug therapy suppress or modify the host
      immunoinflammatory response and neglect the other contributor to disease
      pathogenesis-the environmental microflora. Probiotics are live microbial food
      ingredients that alter the enteric microflora and have a beneficial effect on
      health. The rationale for using probiotics in IBD is mainly based on evidence
      from human studies and experimental animal models implicating intestinal bacteria
      in the pathogenesis of these disorders. The relationship between bacteria and
      intestinal inflammation is complex and does not appear to reflect a simple cause 
      and effect. Similarly, the field of probiotics is complex and in need of rigorous
      research. Until the indigenous flora are better characterized and mechanisms of
      probiotic action defined, the promise of probiotics in IBD is unlikely to be
      fulfilled. Because of strain-specific variability and clinical and therapeutic
      heterogeneity within Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, it cannot be assumed
      that a given probiotic is equally suitable for all individuals. Although
      preliminary results of probiotic therapy in animal models and humans with
      ulcerative colitis and pouchitis have been encouraging, their efficacy in
      treatment or maintenance of remission of Crohn's disease remains to be clarified.
      However, the circumstantial evidence for some form of biotherapeutic modification
      of the enteric flora in Crohn's disease seems compelling. In the future,
      probiotics may offer a simple adjunct to conventional therapy with the emphasis
      on diet shifting from one of nutritional replenishment alone to a more functional
      role.

TI  - Nutritional supplementation with N-3 fatty acids and antioxidants in patients
      with Crohn's disease in remission: effects on antioxidant status and fatty acid
      profile.
PG  - 77-84
AB  - In patients with Crohn's disease (CD), malnutrition is frequently observed and is
      generally accepted to be an important issue. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the effects of 3 months of supplementation with a liquid formula
      containing either antioxidants (AO) or n-3 fatty acids plus AO on the antioxidant
      status and fatty acid profile of plasma phospholipids and adipose tissue,
      respectively, in patients with long-standing CD currently in remission. In a
      randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study, CD patients received either
      placebo, AO, or n-3 fatty acids plus AO for 3 months in addition to their regular
      diet. In all, 25/37 CD patients completed the study. AO status was assessed by
      blood biochemical parameters. A statistical per-protocol analysis was performed. 
      Serum concentrations of selenium, vitamin C, and vitamin E, the activity of
      superoxide dismutase and total antioxidant status were significantly (p < 0.05)
      increased after AO supplementation. Furthermore, compared with controls, serum
      concentrations of beta-carotene, selenium, and vitamin C and the activity of
      glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were significantly (p < 0.05) lower before
      supplementation; however, after AO supplementation these levels were not
      significantly different from controls (except for GPx). N-3 fatty acids plus AO
      supplementation significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the proportion of arachidonic 
      acid, and increased the proportion of eicosapentanoic acid and docosahexanoic
      acid in both plasma phospholipids and adipose tissue. Supplementation with
      antioxidants improved antioxidant status in patients with CD in remission. In
      addition, supplementation with n-3 fatty acids plus antioxidants significantly
      changed the eicosanoid precursor profile, which may lead to the production of
      eicosanoids with attenuated proinflammatory activity. This study indicates that
      an immunomodulating formula containing n-3 fatty acids and/or AO may have the
      potential to play a role in the treatment of CD.

TI  - Laparoscopic colectomy compares favorably with colectomy by laparotomy for
      reduction of postoperative ileus.
PG  - 61-5
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare the length of postoperative ileus
      in patients undergoing colectomy by either laparotomy or laparoscopy. METHODS: A 
      total of 166 patients were studied. These patients were divided into two groups: 
      Group 1, in which colectomy was done laparoscopically, and Group 2, consisting of
      patients undergoing laparotomy. Both groups contained 83 patients who were
      matched for disease severity, indications for surgery, and procedure. Indications
      for surgery included sigmoid diverticulitis in 12 (14 percent) patients, polyps
      in 22 (27 percent), Crohn's disease in 21 (25 percent), colorectal cancer in 11
      (13 percent), stoma reversal in 8 (10 percent), rectal prolapse in 3 (4 percent),
      and other indications in 6 (7 percent) in each group. Operations were colectomy
      with anastomosis (42 ileocolic, 26 colorectal, 6 colocolic, 4 ileorectal, and 2
      ileal J pouch) or without anastomosis (3 abdominoperineal resections) performed
      by the same surgeons during the same time period January 1993 to October 1996).
      The nasogastric tube was removed from all patients immediately after surgery in
      both groups. All patients received a clear liquid diet on the first postoperative
      day, followed by a regular diet as tolerated. The nasogastric tube was reinserted
      if two or more episodes of emesis of more than 200 ml occurred in the absence of 
      bowel movement. Patients were discharged from the hospital when tolerating a
      regular diet without evidence of ileus. Statistical analysis was performed using 
      unpaired t-test and Fisher's exact probability test. RESULTS: The male-to-female 
      ratio was 38 to 45 in both groups. A total of 10 (12 percent) and 23 (28 percent)
      patients in Group 1 and Group 2 had emesis (P = 0.02), and the rate of
      nasogastric tube reinsertion was 5 (6 percent) and 13 (16 percent), respectively 
      (P > 0.05). There were significant differences between Groups 1 and 2 relative to
      the lengths of ileus (3.5 +/- 1.3 vs. 5.4 +/- 1.7 days, respectively; P < 0.001),
      hospitalization (6.6 +/- 3.3 vs. 8.1 +/- 2.5 days, respectively; P < 0.002), and 
      operative time (170 +/- 60 vs. 114 +/- 46 minutes, respectively; P < 0.001). The 
      morbidity rate was 16 (19.2 percent) and 18 (21.6 percent) in the laparoscopy and
      laparotomy groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although early oral intake is safe 
      and can be tolerated by 84 percent of patients after colectomy by laparotomy,
      laparoscopic colectomy reduced the lengths of both postoperative ileus and
      hospitalization.

TI  - Decrease of serum carotenoids in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 159-61
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) is frequently complicated by various nutritional
      disturbances. Although it is important to correct these disturbances, the
      nutritional status of CD patients has been poorly documented, especially
      concerning vitamin status. The aims of this study were (a) to measure the serum
      concentrations of vitamin A and six other carotenoids (lutein, zeaxanthin,
      alpha-, beta-carotene, alpha-, beta-cryptoxanthin) in patients with CD and to
      compare them with those in healthy controls and (b) to follow the changes of
      serum carotenoid levels in CD patients during treatment. Twenty-eight patients
      with CD and 23 healthy persons were included in this study. The results of twelve
      patients were followed up through one year. The patients were free of any
      nutritional treatment. The serum concentrations of carotenoids were measured with
      high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The serum concentrations of five
      carotenoids were significantly lower in the patients than in the controls
      (vitamin A, zeaxanthin: P < 0.001; alpha-, beta-carotene: P < 0.01; lutein: P <
      0.05). The carotenoid status of the followed patients advanced to the normal
      range, but this increase was not significant. These findings suggest that there
      is a deficiency of vitamin A and its provitamins in Crohn' s disease prior to
      treatment. However, because we did not evaluate the vitamin intake in this study,
      we could not conclude which of the factors--poor intake, increased requirement,
      or malabsorption--was more important in decreasing of carotenoid levels.

TI  - Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine for the treatment of perianal Crohn's disease
      in children.
PG  - 294-8
AB  - Numerous adult studies show a 30-65% response rate to azathioprine (AZA) or
      6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) for significant perianal Crohn's disease. The aim of this
      study was to evaluate whether these drugs healed pediatric perianal Crohn's
      disease. Records of pediatric Crohn's patients were retrospectively reviewed for 
      significant perianal disease treated with AZA or 6-MP for > or =6 months. The
      patient's perianal disease was reviewed and evaluated for fistulas, drainage,
      induration, and tenderness. In addition, the patients were given a score using
      the Irvine Perianal Disease Activity Index (PDAI). Patients were retrospectively 
      scored upon initiation of treatment and after six months of therapy. Possible
      scores ranged from 0-20. Twenty patients met the study criteria. Five patients
      were considered treatment failures. One patient required a colostomy after 1.5
      months of therapy, one developed pancreatitis, and three were noncompliant with
      therapy. Of the remaining 15 patients who were treated for > or =6 months, 67%
      had an improvement in drainage, 73% in tenderness, 60% in induration, and 40% in 
      fistula closure. The mean Irvine PDAI was 7.67 +/- 2.19 initially and 4.40 +/-
      1.72 after six months of therapy. The improvement was statistically significant
      (p < 0.001). AZA and 6-MP are effective treatments for healing significant
      perianal Crohn's disease in pediatrics.

      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 296-8
AB  - Perianal fistulae are frequently seen complications in Crohn's disease. Although 
      surgical procedures such as Seton's method have been devised, many patients still
      suffer from fistulae that are resistant to conventional therapy. We administered 
      oral adsorbent to a patient with disease Crohn's who had a complicated peristomal
      fistula that did not improve with conventional therapy. Six grams of oral
      adsorbent (AST-120) were added daily to a regimen of elemental diet therapy and
      prednisolone. The fistula gradually decreased in size after the administration of
      the oral adsorbent, and had healed completely after 40 days' treatment. There
      were no side effects from the oral adsorbent. This case report suggests that oral
      adsorbent is an effective treatment for peristomal fistula associated with
      Crohn's disease.

TI  - Mucosal healing and a fall in mucosal pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA induced by a
      specific oral polymeric diet in paediatric Crohn's disease.
PG  - 281-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although enteral nutrition is a recognized form of treatment for
      intestinal Crohn's disease, there are persisting problems with feed palatability 
      and only limited data as to its mode of action. AIM: To assess the effects of a
      specific oral polymeric diet (CT3211; Nestle, Vevey, Switzerland), which is rich 
      in transforming growth factor beta2, on the mucosal inflammatory process.
      METHODS: Twenty-nine consecutive children with active intestinal Crohn's disease 
      were treated with CT3211 as the sole source of nutrition for 8 weeks. Patients
      were assessed clinically, and endoscopically, whilst cytokine mRNA was measured
      in mucosal biopsies before and after treatment by quantitative reverse
      transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: After 8 weeks 79% of children
      were in complete clinical remission. Macroscopic and histological healing in the 
      terminal ileum and colon was associated with a decline in ileal and colonic
      interleukin-1beta mRNA (pre-treatment to post-treatment ratio 0.008 and 0.06: P <
      0.001, P = 0.006). In the ileum there was also a fall in interferon gamma mRNA
      (ratio 0.15, P < 0.001) with a rise in transforming growth factor beta1 mRNA
      (ratio 10, P = 0.04), whilst in the colon interleukin-8 mRNA fell with treatment 
      (ratio 0.06, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical response to oral polymeric diet
      CT3211 is associated with mucosal healing and a down regulation of mucosal
      pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA in both the terminal ileum and colon. In the ileum
      there was also an increase in transforming growth factor beta1 mRNA.

TI  - Oral tacrolimus (FK 506) in Crohn's disease complicated by fistulae of the
      perineum.
PG  - 200-2
AB  - We describe the cases of two patients with Crohn's disease affected by severe
      perineal fistulae resistant to conventional therapies, successfully treated with 
      FK 506, a new immunomodulatory drug. It is well absorbed from diseased bowel and 
      preliminary experiences have indicated its short-term use in complicated Crohn's 
      disease. The first patient was a 24-year-old male with perineal fistula and
      severe skin ulceration (8 cm of external opening diameter). He had undergone
      colectomy and ileostomy because of severe pancolitis refractory to medical
      treatment and had been treated with azathioprine and metronidazole. Two months
      after starting FK 506, a dramatic improvement made further surgical operation
      unnecessary. Local and general benefit was observed during the following 26
      months, until FK 506 was withdrawn. The second patient was a 28-year-old male
      with a diagnosis of ulcerative pancolitis changed to Crohn's disease two months
      after the onset of a perineal fistula, recurring despite drainage procedures,
      steroid therapy, and total parenteral nutrition. FK 506 was administered for two 
      months with a complete healing of fistula. Successively, it was stopped and
      corticosteroids (associated to enteral nutrition) were given because of recurrent
      rectal bleeding. Our experience encourages the use of oral FK 506 in complicated 
      Crohn's disease and suggests the possibility of a long-term primary therapy other
      than the use as a "bridge" to other treatments.

TI  - Polymeric versus elemental diet as primary treatment in active Crohn's disease: a
      randomized, double-blind trial.
PG  - 735-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Enteral feeding is now an established primary therapy for active
      Crohn's disease. This first-double blind randomized trial was designed to compare
      the therapeutic efficacy of a polymeric diet (PD) with an elemental diet (ED).
      METHODS: Patients with active Crohn's disease (Crohn's disease activity index
      [CDAI] > 150, increased bowel uptake of Tc-HMPAO-labeled leukocytes, and abnormal
      C-reactive protein [CRP]), were randomized to receive either an ED or a PD. The
      two preparations were identical except for the nitrogen source, which was amino
      acid based in ED and intact protein in PD. Enteral feeding was considered
      successful if clinical remission was achieved as defined by a final CDAI of < or 
      = 150, a reduction in the CDAI by at least 100 points from baseline level, and a 
      normal CRP. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were enrolled of whom 11 were randomized
      to PD and 10 to ED. The two groups were comparable at entry. Clinical remission
      was obtained in eight (80%) patients receiving ED and six (55%) patients
      receiving PD, p = 0.1. The treatment failed in three and two patients in the PD
      and ED groups, respectively. Another two patients were intolerant to the feed
      (PD). Reduction in the CDAI after treatment with ED (359 +/- 67 to 112 +/- 19)
      was similar to that seen with PD (303 +/- 27 to 97 +/- 11). Similar changes in
      the CRP were also observed (16 +/- 5 to 4 +/- 1.6) and (62 +/- 20 to 9 +/- 6),
      respectively. Overall, enteral feeding was successful in 14 patients (63%).
      CONCLUSIONS: Enteral nutrition is effective in treatment of active Crohn's
      disease. Differences in nitrogen sources of enteral feeds are not relevant to
      their therapeutic efficacy, as polymeric and elemental diets are equally
      effective.

TI  - Direct hospital costs for patients with inflammatory bowel disease in a Canadian 
      tertiary care university hospital.
PG  - 677-83
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We set out to determine the direct costs of hospitalizations of
      patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis admitted to a
      university-affiliated tertiary care hospital and to contrast the costs of medical
      versus surgical inpatient care, Crohn's disease versus ulcerative colitis, and to
      identify dominant components of inpatient costs. METHODS: We used a
      patient-specific case costing system at Saint Boniface General Hospital,
      Winnipeg, Manitoba, for fiscal years 1994 and 1995. We extracted all inpatients
      whose hospital discharge abstracts included ICD-9-CM codes 555 (Crohn's disease) 
      and 556 (ulcerative colitis) among the top eight discharge diagnoses, and
      performed a chart review on all cases to ensure that the hospitalization was for 
      inflammatory bowel disease and the diagnoses were accurate. We analyzed cases
      based on their disease diagnosis, primary mode of therapy associated with the
      hospitalization (medical vs surgical), and their major diagnosis-related group
      (DRG). This study evaluated direct patient care costs only and costs are
      expressed in Canadian dollars. RESULTS: Of 362 hospital admissions, 325 were
      eligible and of these admissions 275 belonged to the digestive system DRGs.
      Seventy-one (37%) were admitted more than once during the 2 yr of the study,
      accounting for 202 (62%) of the total number of admissions. The mean cost per
      admission of all cases of Crohn's disease was $3,149 (95% confidence interval
      [CI], $2,665-$3,634) and for ulcerative colitis was $3,726 (95% CI
      $3,008-$4,445). Surgical therapy cases accounted for 49.8% of all admissions,
      57.8% of all hospital days, and 60.5% of all costs. Patients treated surgically
      had more costly hospitalizations than those treated medically, particularly when 
      analyzing only nontotal parenteral nutrition (TPN) cases. Surgical treatment
      admissions were significantly more costly for ulcerative colitis digestive DRG
      admissions than Crohn's disease. The nondigestive DRG admissions were more costly
      than the digestive DRGs in all categories although this was only statistically
      different among medically treated Crohn's disease. Patients treated medically
      were similarly costly whether they had Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.
      There was no significant difference in cost per admission among cases admitted
      multiple times, compared with those admitted only once. TPN cases accounted for
      9.5% of cases but 27.1% of costs. TPN-associated hospitalizations were more
      costly than non-TPN-use hospitalizations but these costs were primarily driven by
      duration of stay rather than TPN use itself. For all cases, the top five cost
      categories in descending order were nursing unit bed-days, drugs and pharmacy,
      diagnostic lab tests, operating room, and diagnostic imaging and endoscopy.
      CONCLUSIONS: Using our system we could determine direct costs for inpatients with
      inflammatory bowel disease and the factors that determined increased costs.
      Medical therapy admissions were similarly costly between Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis; however, surgical therapy admissions were costlier among
      ulcerative colitis patients. Admissions for nondigestive DRGs were more costly
      than those for digestive DRGs. TPN use identified a sicker group of patients who 
      remained in the hospital longer than nonusers and, not surprisingly, these were
      the costliest patients.

TI  - The long-term results of resection and multiple resections in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 41-51
AB  - Crohn's disease is a panenteric, transmural inflammatory disease of unknown
      origin. Although primarily managed medically, 70% to 90% of patients will require
      surgical intervention. Surgery for small bowel Crohn's is usually necessary for
      unrelenting stenotic complications of the disease. Fistula, abscess, and
      perforation can also necessitate surgical intervention. Most patients benefit
      from resection or strictureplasty with an improved quality of life and remission 
      of disease, but recurrence is common and 33% to 82% of patients will need a
      second operation, and 22% to 33% will require more than two resections.
      Short-bowel syndrome is unavoidable in a small percentage of Crohn's patients
      because of recurrent resection of affected small bowel and inflammatory
      destruction of the remaining mucosa. Although previously a lethal and unrelenting
      disease with death caused by malnutrition, patients with short-bowel syndrome
      today can lead productive lives with maintenance on total parenteral nutrition
      (TPN). This lifestyle, however, does not come without a price. Severe TPN-related
      complications, such as sepsis of indwelling central venous catheters and liver
      failure, do occur. Future developments will focus on more powerful and effective 
      anti-inflammatory medication specifically targeting the immune mechanisms
      responsible for Crohn's disease. Successful medical management of the disease
      will alleviate the need for surgical resection and reduce the frequency of
      short-bowel syndrome. Improving the efficacy of immunosuppression and the
      understanding of tolerance induction should increase the safety and applicability
      of small-bowel transplant for those with short gut. Tissue engineering offers the
      potential to avoid immunosuppression altogether and supplement intestinal length 
      using the patient's own tissues.

TI  - Energy metabolism and substrate oxidation in patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 173-8
AB  - Weight loss and malnutrition are common features in patients with Crohn's
      disease. This study was designed to evaluate diet-induced thermogenesis and
      substrate oxidation in patients with Crohn's disease. Twenty-three patients (17
      women, 6 men; age 34 +/- 2 y) and 17 healthy control subjects (13 women, 4 men;
      age 36 +/- 3 y) were studied. Resting energy expenditure and fasting substrate
      oxidation were measured by indirect calorimetry in the morning after an overnight
      fast. After a standard homogenized test meal (10 kcal/kg), indirect calorimetry
      was performed every 30 min for 3 h to measure the diet-induced thermogenesis and 
      the postprandial substrate oxidation. In the fasting state, resting energy
      expenditure was significantly higher in patients than in control subjects (1433
      +/- 43 versus 1279 +/- 53 kcal/24 h). Lipid oxidation was higher in patients with
      Crohn's disease than in control subjects (1.17 +/- 0. 07 versus 0.61 +/- 0.11 mg.
      kg(-1). min(-1), P < 0.01). Postprandially, diet-induced thermogenesis was
      significantly lower in patients with Crohn's disease than in control subjects
      (4.6% +/- 0.5 versus 6.3% +/- 0.5 of energy intake, P < 0.01). Lipid oxidation
      was significantly higher in patients with Crohn's disease than in control
      subjects (0.78 +/- 0.05 versus 0.56 +/- 0.08 mg. kg(-1). min(-1), P < 0.05), and 
      glucose oxidation was lower in patients with Crohn's disease than in control
      subjects. In patients with Crohn's disease, lipid oxidation positively correlates
      with the disease activity evaluated by the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (r =
      0.48, P150), fasting and postprandial lipid oxidation was significantly higher
      than in patients with inactive Crohn's disease (P < 0.05). In conclusion,
      patients with Crohn's disease have increased fat oxidation, which correlates with
      disease activity and this may explain the reduced fat stores in patients with
      Crohn's disease.

TI  - Altered lipid profile, lipoprotein composition, and oxidant and antioxidant
      status in pediatric Crohn disease.
PG  - 807-15
AB  - BACKGROUND: Growing evidence supports a role for peroxidation in the pathogenesis
      of Crohn disease (CD). The activation of inflammatory cells, the release of their
      mediators, and the excessive production of free radicals may affect circulating
      lipids. OBJECTIVE: We examined the lipid profile, lipoprotein composition, and
      oxidant-antioxidant status of children with CD. DESIGN: We studied 22 pediatric
      CD patients and 10 healthy control subjects. RESULTS: The proportion of saturated
      and monounsaturated fatty acids in plasma of CD patients was higher but that of
      polyunsaturated fatty acids was lower than in control subjects. This resulted in 
      higher ratios in CD patients of palmitoleic acid to linoleic acid (P < 0. 05) and
      of eicosatrienoic acid to arachidonic acid (P < 0.04), 2 established indexes of
      essential fatty acid deficiency. Hypocholesterolemia was noted in CD patients as 
      a result of lower LDL-cholesterol concentrations than in control subjects (P <
      0.02). Plasma apolipoproteins B (P < 0.02) and A-I (P < 0.02) were also lower in 
      CD patients, whereas plasma triacylglycerols were higher (P < 0.005). Lipoprotein
      composition was altered in CD patients, with relative triacylglycerol depletion
      and protein enrichment in VLDL. In contrast, intermediate-density lipoprotein of 
      CD patients was characterized by an increased percentage of triacylglycerol and
      protein (P < 0.005) and a reduced proportion of phospholipids (P < 0. 01).
      Additional abnormalities were observed in the chemical distribution of HDL(2) and
      HDL(3) moieties. Lipid peroxidation was documented by higher plasma
      malondialdehyde concentrations in CD patients (P < 0.05), accompanied by lower
      retinol concentrations (P < 0.02). CONCLUSION: Disturbances in the lipid profile,
      in lipoprotein concentrations and composition, and in oxidant-antioxidant status 
      occur in CD patients.

TI  - Magnetic resonance imaging to distinguish the type and severity of pediatric
      inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 170-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: The distinction between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease is
      important, because treatment options and clinical course may vary. Magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) allows noninvasive transmural assessment of the intestine
      and may facilitate differentiation of ulcerative colitis from Crohn's disease.
      The objective of this prospective study was to determine whether MRI
      differentiates Crohn's disease from ulcerative colitis in children as effectively
      as colonoscopy with mucosal biopsies. METHODS: Fifteen patients underwent
      colonoscopy with biopsies followed by abdominal MRI. The MRI diagnosis,
      determined by two radiologists independently completing a standardized form was
      compared with the gastroenterologic diagnosis. RESULTS: After colonoscopy and
      review of histology, Crohn's disease was diagnosed in nine patients, ulcerative
      colitis in five, and indeterminate colitis in one, who was excluded from study.
      Agreement of the MRI diagnosis with the gastroenterologic diagnosis was 4 of 4
      (100%) for ulcerative colitis, 4 of 10 (40%) for Crohn's disease considering both
      radiologists, and 5 of 10 (50%) for Crohn's disease for each radiologist
      individually. Percentage of enhancement by MRI did not correlate with the
      severity of inflammation determined at endoscopy among the patients with Crohn's 
      disease (r = -0.3, P = 0.366). There was agreement on severity of inflammation in
      three of four patients with ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Current MRI
      interpretation of inflammatory bowel disease did not adequately recognize Crohn's
      disease in children. Therefore, colonoscopy with biopsy remains the most accurate
      tool for determining the type and severity of inflammatory bowel disease in
      children and adolescents.

TI  - Prevalence rates and an evaluation of reported risk factors for osteonecrosis
      (avascular necrosis) in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 138-43
AB  - Avascular necrosis (osteonecrosis) occurs in Crohn's disease, but the rate of
      this particular complication is not known. Over 20 years, 877 patients with
      Crohn's disease, 492 women (56.1%) and 385 men (43.9%), were evaluated with
      patient follow-up data available for a mean of 7.8 years. In this group, four men
      were seen with osteonecrosis. No woman was affected. All patients had typical
      radiological, magnetic resonance imaging or pathological changes of osteonecrosis
      involving the femoral heads, while two also had superimposed avascular necrosis
      involving the humeral heads. Patient ages ranged from 19 to 36 years at the time 
      of diagnosis of their Crohn's disease, and all were white. In one patient,
      disease was confined to the colon, while three patients had disease involving the
      terminal ileum and colon. Disease behaviour in two patients was classified as
      penetrating because of concomitant ischiorectal abscesses, while one patient
      developed a metastatic colon carcinoma. Ankylosing spondylitis was present in two
      patients, but no other extraintestinal manifestations developed. Two patients
      received corticosteroids as well as parenteral nutrition during the course of
      their disease. Two patients did not receive corticosteroids or parenteral
      nutrition. Of 877 patients with Crohn's disease, 484 (55. 1%) received
      corticosteroids during the course of the disease, 196 (22.4%) received at least
      one course of parenteral nutrition, and 125 (14.3%) received both corticosteroids
      and parenteral nutrition. A total of 311 patients (35.5%) had at least one small 
      intestinal resection. The overall rate of avascular necrosis in Crohn's disease
      was less than 0.5% but for men with Crohn's disease was about 1%. In this series,
      risk of osteonecrosis could not be attributed to corticosteroid use, parenteral
      nutrition or both forms of therapy administered together. Small intestinal
      resection with loss of small intestinal absorptive area was not a risk factor for
      the development of osteonecrosis. Avascular necrosis (or osteonecrosis) is a very
      rare extraintestinal osseous complication that may occur in Crohn's disease,
      independent of previously reported risk factors, including corticosteroids or
      parenteral nutrition with lipid emulsions.

TI  - Treatment of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 90-100
AB  - The treatment of Crohn's disease depends on disease location and disease
      activity. It can be divided into medical and surgical treatment. While surgery is
      reserved for complications such as abscesses or failure of pharmacological
      treatment (fistulae, perianal disease, or strictures) medical treatment aims at
      induction and maintenance of remission. In order to achieve these goals
      supportive and therapeutic strategies must be used. Supportive measures include
      substitution of vitamins, particularly fat-soluble vitamins, and minerals in
      deficiencies due to resection or disease involvement of the small bowel. All
      patients on long-term steroids should receive calcium and vitamin D in order to
      prevent osteoporosis. Therapeutic options include drug treatment
      (corticosteroids, antibiotics, salicylates, and immunosuppressives), nutrition
      (parenteral or enteral), and endoscopy (dilatation of strictures). Depending on
      disease location different pharmacologic preparations of salicylates or
      corticosteroids should be used, e.g., enemas for distal colitis. The most potent 
      drugs for long-term control are immunosuppressive agents, particularly
      azathioprine. It is the most widely investigated immunosuppressive agent in
      Crohn's disease and should be the first line treatment for patients with steroid 
      refractory, chronic steroid dependent, fistulating, and stenosing courses. In the
      future, more potent drugs and better risk stratification criteria should improve 
      the treatment of Crohn's disease.

TI  - The cost of hospitalization in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 524-30
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the demographics, resource use, 
      and costs associated with hospitalization of Crohn's disease patients. METHODS:
      All patients hospitalized at our institution from 7/1/96 to 6/30/97 with a
      primary diagnosis of "Crohn's Disease" were analyzed using a computerized
      database. Data are presented "per hospitalization." RESULTS: A total of 175
      hospitalizations (147 patients) were identified. Mean patient age was 36.5 yr;
      61% were female; 82% Caucasian. Payer mix was most commonly contracted (57%),
      commercial (21%), or Medicare (13%). 57% of hospitalizations had a primary
      surgical procedure; the remainder were medical. Average length of stay was 8.7
      days (surgical, 9.6 days; medical, 7.5 days). The average cost of
      hospitalization, excluding physician fees, was $12,528 (surgical, $14,409;
      medical, $10,020), whereas average charges were $35,378 (surgical, $46,354;
      medical, $20,744), including physician fees, which averaged $7,249 (surgical,
      $11,217; medical, $1,959). Mean reimbursements were $21,968 (surgical, $28,946;
      medical, $12,666) with average weighted reimbursement rates of 60.17% of hospital
      charges, 69.57% of physician fees. The distribution of costs across subcategories
      was: Surgery (39.6%), Pharmacy (18.6%), Laboratory (3.8%), Radiology (2.1%),
      Pathology (0.8%), Endoscopy (0.3%), and Other Hospital Costs (34.9%). Of the
      hospitalizations, 87% included treatment with steroids, 23% with
      immunomodulators, and 14% with aminosalicylates; 27% included the administration 
      of total parenteral nutrition, which accounted for 63% of the total pharmacy
      costs. CONCLUSIONS: Surgery accounts for the majority of hospitalizations, nearly
      40% of their total costs, and 75% of overall charges and reimbursements. Therapy 
      that decreases the number of surgical hospitalizations should substantially
      reduce inpatient Crohn's disease costs, as well as overall costs.

      maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 99-104
AB  - Elemental diet (ED) therapy has been established as primary therapy for Crohn's
      disease, and home enteral nutrition (HEN) has been reported to control relapse at
      a dose of more than 30kcal/kg of ideal body weight. However, a decrease in ED
      compliance with long-term use is becoming problem. We developed an n-3 fatty
      acid-rich diet and carried out nutritional education specifically for Crohn's
      disease patients using HEN to facilitate compliance and to improve their
      nutritional status. After the introduction of this n-3 rich diet, disease
      activity was not altered, and nutritional status, especially serum n-3 fatty acid
      levels, improved. The remission periods in patients with poor compliance seemed
      to be prolonged by the nutritional education. Thus, a n-3 rich diet in
      combination with nutritional education specific for Crohn's disease patients is
      very important for the in maintenance of high compliance and for maintaining
      nutritional balance.

TI  - Selenium kinetics and changes in glutathione peroxidase activities in patients
      receiving long-term parenteral nutrition and effects of supplementation with
      selenite.
PG  - 22-6
AB  - Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element in humans. Patients receiving
      long-term parenteral nutrition (PN) are at risk for Se deficiency. We
      investigated changes in Se levels and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity in
      serum and tissue (red blood cells, RBC) in addition to urinary excretion of Se in
      patients receiving long-term PN with and without Se supplementation. In patients 
      without Se supplementation, both Se levels and GSH-Px activity in serum decreased
      with duration of PN. The serum Se levels were below the lower limits of the
      control values in 19 of 33 patients (58%) who received PN for less than 1 mo.
      Conversely, RBC GSH-Px activity remained at a sufficient level in 9 of 12
      patients (75%) who received PN for 3-6 mo. The RBC Se levels in all of these
      patients were lower than the control levels. Urinary Se concentrations were
      significantly correlated with serum Se concentrations by linear regression
      analysis (r = 0.707, P < 0.05). In patients with Se supplementation, urinary Se
      concentrations increased exponentially with increases in serum Se levels. These
      findings indicate that a time lag precedes the decrease in levels of serum Se,
      RBC Se, serum GSH-Px, and RBC GSH-Px in patients without Se supplementation and
      the increase in excretion of urinary Se in patients with Se supplementation. The 
      monitoring of not only serum Se levels but also RBC GSH-Px activity and urinary
      Se levels is required for optimal Se supplementation during long-term PN.

TI  - Effect of a vegetable-protein-rich polymeric diet treatment on body composition
      and energy metabolism in inactive Crohn's disease.
PG  - 5-11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Since malnutrition and lactose intolerance are frequently reported in 
      Crohn's disease (CD), we evaluated the differences in terms of
      compliance-to-treatment and nutritional status in inactive CD patients after two 
      different treatments using either a standard polymeric diet or a
      vegetable-protein-rich and lactose-free diet. STUDY DESIGN: A case-control study.
      SUBJECTS: Forty CD patients with inactive disease were randomly divided into two 
      groups. Group A (10 men; aged 33.9+/-7.2 years; BMI, 21.8+/-1.7 kg/m2) received a
      conventional polymeric enteral diet, while group B (10 men; aged 35.6+/-6.8
      years; BMI, 21.4+/-1.8 kg/m2) was administered a soy-rich and lactose-free
      polymeric diet, over a 4-week period. METHODS: All the patients had a clinical
      and laboratory examination. Body composition was assessed by isotopic dilution
      and resting metabolic rate (RMR), and substrate oxidation rates were measured by 
      indirect calorimetry. RESULTS: Body weight significantly increased after
      treatment in both groups (A, P<0.05; and B, P<0.01), as well as fat-free mass (A,
      P<0.05; and B, P<0.05) and fat mass (A, P<0.05; and B, P<0.01). RMR slightly
      increased, although it did not reach statistical significance. Treatment did not 
      influence substrate oxidation rates. Group B lactose-intolerant patients reported
      a greater compliance-to-treatment than those in group A. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      showed that a polymeric enteral diet rich in vegetable protein and not containing
      milk protein, eaten at home, with no need for positioning a nasogastric tube,
      significantly improved body composition in inactive and lactose-intolerant CD
      patients, with no effect on energy metabolism, suggesting that it could be useful
      in improving nutritional status in these patients.

TI  - Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis associated with chronic inflammatory
      bowel disease in children.
PG  - 2500-7
AB  - Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is a rare disease of children
      characterized by aseptic inflammation of the long bones and clavicles. No
      infectious etiology has been identified, and CRMO has been associated with a
      number of autoimmune diseases (including Wegener's granulomatosis and psoriasis).
      The relationship between CRMO and inflammatory bowel disease is poorly described.
      Through an internet bulletin board subscribed to by 500 pediatric
      gastroenterologists, we identified six inflammatory bowel disease patients (two
      with ulcerative colitis, four with Crohn's colitis) with confirmed CRMO. In all
      cases, onset of the bony lesions preceded the onset of bowel symptoms by as much 
      as five years. Immunosuppressive therapy for the bowel disease generally resulted
      in improvement of the bone inflammation. Chronic recurrent multifocal
      osteomyelitis should be considered in any inflammatory bowel disease patient with
      unexplained bone pain or areas of uptake on bone scan. CRMO may be a rare
      extraintestinal manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease; alternatively,
      certain individuals may be genetically predisposed to the development of both
      diseases.

TI  - Double-blind randomized controlled trial of glutamine-enriched polymeric diet in 
      the treatment of active Crohn's disease.
PG  - 78-84
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glutamine is traditionally considered a nonessential amino acid but
      may be conditionally essential in patients with catabolic conditions.
      Glutamine-supplemented foods in these patients have been shown to prevent
      deterioration of gut permeability, protect against the development of intestinal 
      mucosal atrophy, and improve nitrogen balance. Animal models of inflammatory
      bowel disease suggest that glutamine-enriched enteral diets may lead to less
      severe intestinal damage, less weight loss, improved nitrogen balance, and
      reduced disease activity. The purpose of the current study was to compare the
      efficacy of a glutamine-enriched polymeric diet with a standard low-glutamine
      polymeric diet in the treatment of active Crohn's disease. METHODS: Eighteen
      children with active Crohn's disease were randomly assigned to receive a 4-week
      course of either a standard polymeric diet with a low glutamine content (4% of
      amino acid composition; group S) or a glutamine-enriched polymeric diet (42% of
      amino acid composition; Group G). The two diets were isocaloric and
      isonitrogenous with an identical essential amino acid profile. Remission rates
      were analysed on an intent-to-treat basis. Changes in clinical and laboratory
      parameters of disease activity were also compared after 4 weeks of nutritional
      treatment. RESULTS: Two of the children, both in group G, were withdrawn from the
      trial because of nontolerance of the diet. There was no difference between the
      two groups in proportion of patients achieving remission (intent-to-treat basis):
      5 (55.5%) of 9 in group S versus 4 (44.4%) of 9 in group G (p = 0.5). Improvement
      in mean paediatric Crohn's disease activity index (PCDAI) was significantly more 
      in group S (p = 0.002) but changes in orosomucoid level, platelet count, and
      weight were not different between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest
      that a glutamine-enriched polymeric diet offers no advantage over a standard
      low-glutamine polymeric diet in the treatment of active Crohn's disease. Rather, 
      it appears to be less effective in improving PCDAI. The reported beneficial
      effects of glutamine seen in many catabolic states must be viewed with caution
      when extrapolating to the management of Crohn's disease.

TI  - Low levels of glutathione in endoscopic biopsies of patients with Crohn's
      colitis: the role of malnutrition.
PG  - 313-7
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: During active Crohn's disease, generation of free radicals
      is increased, and nutritional depletion is frequent. We investigated the
      glutathione concentration of the colonic mucosa in biopsies from patients with
      active Crohn's colitis depending on nutritional status. METHODS: Endoscopic
      biopsies were taken in 10 well-nourished control patients, and 18 patients with
      active Crohn's disease (11 well-nourished, seven malnourished with a recent
      weight loss > 10 %). Colonic biopsies were taken from healthy and inflamed mucosa
      and analysed for total glutathione concentration. RESULTS: Mucosal glutathione
      concentration (nmol/mg wet tissue) was lower in patients with active colitis both
      in diseased and healthy mucosa as compared with controls (1.89 +/- 0.39, 2.08 +/-
      0.4 and 6.69 +/- 4. 94, respectively, P< 0.05). Mucosal glutathione was lower in 
      healthy mucosa from malnourished versus well-nourished patients: 1.8 +/- 0.2 vs
      2.3 +/- 0.37 (P= 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Mucosal glutathione is markedly lower in
      active Crohn's colitis, even in healthy mucosa; glutathione depletion tends to be
      more severe in malnourished patients. Glutathione depletion may be related in
      part to malnutrition and contribute to a prolonged evolution of disease and could
      be a target for pharmacological and nutritional support.

AB  - Dietetic treatment of Crohn's disease has the objective to calm down the gut
      either by a polymeric or elemental diet. In superacute conditions also total
      parenteral nutrition can be used. In the quiescent stage the patient must have an
      adequate energy intake and a low-residue (low-fibre) diet. As to medication,
      sulfasalazine which has some side-effects is abandoned and 5-ASA
      (5-aminosalicylic acid) preparations are used, either by the oral route or in
      enemas, while 4-ASA is little used in this country and is known as PAS. The
      administration of corticoids which also have side-effects will be abandoned in
      favour of so-called rapidly metabolized corticoids (Tixocortol pivalate,
      beclomethasone, budenoside and fluticasone) by the oral route and in enemas and
      foams. As antimicrobial treatment ciprofloxacine is used combined with
      metronidazole. As to immunosuppressive drugs azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine,
      cyclosporin A, cyclophosphamide and methotrexate are tested. A hope for the
      future is so-called biological treatment (anticytokines, monoclonal antibodies
      against cytokines, against CD4+ TNF, interleukines IL-10 and 11, immunoglobulin; 
      plasmapheresis is also tested). Treatment must be individual and surgery as late 
      as possible, only in case of complications, and should be very sparing, stenoses 
      should be treated by plastic operations of strictures.

TI  - Effects of current and former cigarette smoking on the clinical course of Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 1403-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking is associated with a more severe course of Crohn's 
      disease, but individual factors determining this effect are poorly known and it
      is not clear whether smoking cessation is associated with an improvement in the
      disease activity. AIM: To assess the factors determining the harmful effect of
      smoking in individuals with Crohn's disease. METHODS: A total of 622 consecutive 
      patients with Crohn's disease and Crohn's disease activity index <200 were
      enrolled in a prospective 12-18 month cohort study. Patients were classified as
      current smokers, former smokers, or non-smokers. Alcohol consumption, oral
      contraceptive use, body mass index, and blood lipid levels were also recorded.
      The main outcome measure was the rate of flare-up. RESULTS: A total of 139
      current smokers (46%) developed a flare-up, vs. 79 non-smokers (30%) and 13
      former smokers (23%). The relative risk of flare-up adjusted for confounding
      factors was 1.35 (1.03-1.76) in current smokers. This risk was increased in
      patients with previously inactive disease and in those who had no colonic
      lesions. It became significant above a threshold of 15 cigarettes per day. Former
      smokers behaved like non-smokers. Obesity, dyslipidaemia, and alcohol consumption
      had no significant effect. CONCLUSIONS: Current smoking, particularly heavy
      smoking, markedly increases the risk of flare-up in Crohn's disease. Former
      smokers have a risk similar to that of non-smokers.

PG  - 71S-80S
AB  - Energy-protein malnutrition and the sub-clinical deficiencies of vitamins and
      trace elements, are frequent findings in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, 
      and these may negatively influence the clinical course of these diseases. In
      general, the majority of the patients with ulcerative colitis and uncomplicated
      Crohn's disease can ingest a normal diet that is well balanced and without any
      restrictions. The intolerance to specific foods is rare in Crohn's disease and
      the application of exclusion diets in a routine manner is not indicated. When the
      nutritional status cannot be adequately maintained with normal ingestion, the use
      of artificial nutrition is indicated. Enteral nutrition is the first choice
      nutritional support system if the gastrointestinal tract is accessible and at
      least partially functional. In Crohn's disease enteral nutrition could have a
      specific anti-inflammatory effect ("primary treatment"), and it has been
      suggested that this could be effective to induce the clinical remission of the
      activity bouts of the disease. Some types of dietary fiber could be effective in 
      the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Initial studies suggest their usefulness in 
      maintaining the remission of the disease.

TI  - Risk factors for low bone mineral density in children and young adults with
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 593-600
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Low bone mineral density (BMD) is a recognized complication of Crohn's
      disease (CD). The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors for low BMD 
      in pediatric patients with CD. STUDY DESIGN: One hundred nineteen subjects with
      CD ranging in age from 5 to 25 years were enrolled. BMD of the lumbar spine was
      measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Growth parameters were assessed by 
      examination. Disease-specific variables and use of selected medications were
      determined by chart review. RESULTS: Powerful risk factors for low BMD z-score
      included hypoalbuminemia, exposure to nasogastric tube feeds, total parenteral
      nutrition, 6-mercaptopurine, and corticosteroids. Corticosteroid dosing at a
      level >7.5 mg/d, 5000 mg lifetime cumulative dose, or >12 months of lifetime
      exposure were significant risk factors for low BMD z-score. Weaker but
      significant associations with low BMD z-scores included measures of disease
      severity such as pediatric Crohn's disease activity index, hospital admissions,
      and length of hospital stay. Site and duration of disease were not predictive.
      CONCLUSIONS: The presence of several clinically available factors was predictive 
      of poor bone mineral status in this sample of subjects with CD. Hypoalbuminemia, 
      corticosteroid exposure, nasogastric tube feeds, total parenteral nutrition, and 
      6-mercaptopurine were the most powerful risk factors for low bone mineral status.

      recurrence after strictureplasty for jejunoileal Crohn's disease.
PG  - 240-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: This retrospective study was undertaken to examine the long-term
      outcome of strictureplasty for Crohn's disease and factors affecting the
      incidence of postoperative septic complications and recurrence. METHODS:
      Eighty-seven patients who underwent 245 primary jejunoileal strictureplasties for
      jejunoileal Crohn's disease between 1980 and 1997 were reviewed. RESULTS: Septic 
      complications (fistula/abscess) occurred in 7 patients (all at strictureplasty
      site). Only intra-abdominal sepsis with peritoneal contamination at laparotomy
      was significantly associated with these complications. After a median follow-up
      of 104 months, 49 patients (56%) developed symptomatic recurrence. In 11
      patients, symptomatic recurrence was successfully managed by medical treatment.
      Thirty-eight patients (44%) required further surgery for recurrence. Only young
      age (< or = 37 years) was associated with high incidence of reoperation for
      recurrence. Preoperative steroid use, nutritional status, synchronous bowel
      resection, and number, site, or length of strictureplasties did not affect the
      incidence of septic complications and recurrence requiring reoperation.
      CONCLUSIONS: Intra-abdominal sepsis with peritoneal contamination increased the
      incidence of septic complications. Only young age was associated with the
      increased risk of recurrence requiring reoperation.

TI  - Lymph loss in the bowel and severe nutritional disturbances in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 277-9
AB  - A severe nutritional deficiency status is described in a 22-year-old patient with
      Crohn's disease. The clinical picture on admission was dominated by an episode of
      gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to clotting disturbances (vitamin K
      deficiency) and severe cachexia due to a protein energy malnutrition. The
      mechanisms of severe nutritional disturbances in Crohn's disease are
      multifactorial. In this patient, lymphatic leakage into the intestinal lumen was 
      a major contributing factor in the pathogenesis of protein-losing enteropathy,
      fat malabsorption, and lymphocytopenia. The authors were able to demonstrate this
      intestinal lymph loss by nuclear imaging.

TI  - The role of total parenteral nutrition in the management of patients with acute
      attacks of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 270-5
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the prolonged duration of
      total parenteral nutrition (TPN) on the clinical, laboratory, and nutritional
      parameters and short-term outcome in acute attacks of ulcerative colitis and
      Crohn's colitis, and the difference in the response to TPN between the two
      diseases. Twenty-two patients with severely and moderately active ulcerative
      colitis (8 severe and 14 moderate) and 12 patients with Crohn's colitis were
      analyzed retrospectively. Eleven of 22 patients with ulcerative colitis were
      treated with TPN and corticosteroids (TPN group). The remaining 11 patients were 
      treated with corticosteroids alone and hospital meals (oral diet group). Both
      groups were matched regarding disease severity at pretreatment. The clinical
      characteristics, and the initial and total dosages of corticosteroids for 3 weeks
      were similar between the two groups. The authors compared the changes in the
      clinical, inflammatory, and nutritional parameters and short-term outcome between
      the TPN and the oral diet groups with ulcerative colitis. The same evaluations
      were also made for 12 patients with Crohn's colitis who received TPN (CD group). 
      The TPN group did not show any significant improvement in the clinical parameter,
      inflammatory signs, or nutritional state compared with the oral diet group with
      ulcerative colitis. The remission rate after 3 weeks of therapy and a colectomy
      rate also showed no significant difference between the two groups. In contrast,
      TPN resulted in a disappearance of clinical symptoms and an improvement in both
      the inflammatory and nutritional parameters in the CD group. Only one of the 12
      patients with Crohn's colitis underwent colectomy. TPN induced no additional
      benefit in corticosteroid therapy in an acute attack of ulcerative colitis. In
      contrast, TPN may have primary effects on Crohn's colitis.

TI  - Status of lipidsoluble antioxidants and TRAP in patients with Crohn's disease and
      healthy controls.
PG  - 675-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the status of lipidsoluble antioxidants (carotenoids,
      tocopherols, ubiquinone), retinol and their correlation with TRAP (total
      radical-trapping antioxidant potential) in patients with Crohn's disease. DESIGN:
      Prospective case-control study. SETTING: Clinic of Internal Medicine
      IV/Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Vienna Medical
      School. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Plasma antioxidant concentrations were determined in
      patients with Crohn's disease (n = 24) to evaluate the antioxidant capacity
      compared to healthy controls (n = 33). Additionally, plasma TRAP (total
      radical-trapping antioxidant potential) was measured in 13 patients and 22
      controls. RESULTS: All investigated carotenoids (alpha-carotene, beta-carotene
      and cryptoxanthin) were significantly decreased in patients with Crohn's disease 
      (10.2 +/- 9.3, 16.2 +/- 12.4 and 7.8 +/- 5.5 microg/dl) compared to controls
      (13.3 +/- 5.1, 34.7 +/- 18.8 and 48.5 +/- 38.4 microg/dl respectively), whereas
      gamma-tocopherol and ubiquinone were significantly elevated in patients (0.14 +/-
      0.07 microg/dl and 82.3 +/- 41.5 microg/dl, controls: 0.09 +/- 0.04 microg/dl and
      60.8 +/- 30.0 microg/dl, respectively). Retinol and alpha-tocopherol did not
      significantly differ from controls. The total radical-trapping antioxidant
      potential (TRAP) was significantly lower in patients (1.11 +/- 0.28 micromol/l)
      compared to controls (1.34 +/- 0.26 micromol/l). Antioxidants were neither
      related to duration or severity of disease nor to disease activity. CONCLUSIONS: 
      In patients with Crohn's disease several plasma antioxidant parameters are
      altered and the total radical-trapping antioxidant potential is decreased.

PG  - 145-52
AB  - Using a simplified questionnaire from the NADYA group, data referring to age,
      sex, diagnosis, access route, duration, form of administration, complications,
      and quality of life have been gathered from 1,400 patients (57% male, 43% female)
      who receive home enteral nutrition, and from 38 patients (20% male and 18%
      female) who receive home parenteral nutrition. All of these patients come from
      the 1996 national registry. The most common indication for home enteral nutrition
      are neoplasias (39%) followed by neurological alterations (33%). The most common 
      access route is oral (48%), followed by a nasogastric tube in 34%, PEG in 10% and
      surgical ostomies in 7%. The average treatment duration is 6 months. There is an 
      index of 0.74 complications/patient-year (gastrointestinal 0.28 and mechanical
      alterations 0.19). At the end of the year 58% of the patients continued to use at
      home enteral nutrition, with a death rate of 17%. The majority of the treated
      patients presented a severe social disability (28%) or was bed-ridden (22%). The 
      most common indications for home parenteral nutrition are: neoplasia (42%),
      Crohn_s disease (10%), and mesenteric ischemia (10%). AIDS (8%), radical
      enteritis (5%), and motility disorders (5%) are less common. In 42% of the cases 
      tunneled catheters are used, and port-a-cath are used in 53%. The average
      treatment duration is 6.9 months. 1.06 hospitalizations/patient-year have been
      registered in relation to the nutritional treatment (mainly catheter sepsis). A
      mortality of 29% is registered, and there is recovery of the oral route in 7.9%
      of the cases. 50% of the patients present a severe social disability.

TI  - Management of urinary complications in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 713-7
AB  - Among the 127 patients who underwent surgical treatment for Crohn's disease at
      Tohoku University Hospital, urinary complications were noted in 13 patients
      (10.2%), including urolithiasis in 6 patients (4.7%), a ureteral obstruction in 4
      (3.1%), and urinary fistula in 3 (2.4%). In patients with urolithiasis,
      conservative therapy was effective. An ureteral obstruction was detected on the
      right side in all 4 of these cases because of the inflamed terminal ileum. In 2
      of the 4 cases, the symptoms improved by either preoperative total parenteral
      nutrition or elemental diet therapy. A resection of the inflamed intestine was
      necessary in all cases. In patients with urinary fistulas, a resection of the
      inflamed intestine combined with a reconstruction of the urinary tract was
      carried out after total parenteral nutrition. In conclusion, conservative therapy
      with preoperative total parenteral nutrition or elemental diet therapy proved to 
      be effective for a ureteral obstruction since it improved the intestinal
      inflammation. As a definitive treatment, surgery is still necessary for the
      management of urinary fistulas and ureteral obstruction. Based on our findings,
      patients with urolithiasis in Crohn's disease should thus be treated
      conservatively in the same way as patients without Crohn's disease.

TI  - Essential fatty acids in health and chronic disease.
PG  - 560S-569S
LID - 10.1093/ajcn/70.3.560s [doi]
AB  - Human beings evolved consuming a diet that contained about equal amounts of n-3
      and n-6 essential fatty acids. Over the past 100-150 y there has been an enormous
      increase in the consumption of n-6 fatty acids due to the increased intake of
      vegetable oils from corn, sunflower seeds, safflower seeds, cottonseed, and
      soybeans. Today, in Western diets, the ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids ranges
      from approximately 20-30:1 instead of the traditional range of 1-2:1. Studies
      indicate that a high intake of n-6 fatty acids shifts the physiologic state to
      one that is prothrombotic and proaggregatory, characterized by increases in blood
      viscosity, vasospasm, and vasoconstriction and decreases in bleeding time. n-3
      Fatty acids, however, have antiinflammatory, antithrombotic, antiarrhythmic,
      hypolipidemic, and vasodilatory properties. These beneficial effects of n-3 fatty
      acids have been shown in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease,
      hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and, in some patients with renal disease,
      rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease, and chronic obstructive 
      pulmonary disease. Most of the studies were carried out with fish oils
      [eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)]. However,
      alpha-linolenic acid, found in green leafy vegetables, flaxseed, rapeseed, and
      walnuts, desaturates and elongates in the human body to EPA and DHA and by itself
      may have beneficial effects in health and in the control of chronic diseases.

PG  - 345-6
AB  - The case of a 45 year old female with multiple complications of Crohn's disease
      is reported. After multiple resections in the gastrointestinal tract she had been
      suffering from short bowel syndrome and severe malnutrition. With a special
      continuous gastric tube feeding system, she was able to maintain her weight for
      years. In the beginning of 1997 the enteral nutrition was not longer tolerated
      for an exacerbation of chronic pancreatitis. There was a weight loss, permanent
      pain and total parenteral nutrition had to be performed. In this situation a new 
      liquid preparation of pancreatic enzymes which had been tested in the laboratory 
      before, was used for continuous enzyme replacement via gastric tube. In
      combination with this enzyme preparation, enteral nutrition could successfully be
      started again.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease may manifest in various extra intestinal
      manifestations. Osteopenia and various arthropathies may be debilitating. These
      may be related to the disease itself, patient genetics, lifestyle, or disease
      treatment. Calcium and vitamin D malabsorption, vitamin K deficiency,
      malnutrition, corticosteroid and other immunosuppressive medications, smoking,
      lack of exercise and postmenopausal state may all play important roles. Treatment
      may be undertaken to correct nutrient deficiencies, inhibit bone resorption and
      increase bone formation.

TI  - Home parenteral nutrition in adults: a european multicentre survey in 1997.
      ESPEN-Home Artificial Nutrition Working Group.
PG  - 135-40
AB  - A retrospective survey on home parenteral nutrition (HPN) in Europe was performed
      from January to December 1997. Data were compared to a similar study performed in
      1993. A questionnaire of HPN practice was designed by the members of the
      ESPEN-HAN group. This involved adult patients (older than 16 years) newly
      registered in an HPN program between 1 January and 31 December 1997 and included:
      number of patients, underlying diseases and a 6-12 month outcome. Incidence and
      prevalence (at 1.1.1998) of adult HPN were calculated according to the estimated 
      total population in 1997 for the countries in which more than 80% of HPN patients
      were reported.A total of 494 patients were registered in 73 centres from nine
      countries (Belgium (B), Denmark (D), France (F), Poland (P), Spain (S), Sweden
      (Sw), United Kingdom (UK), The Netherlands (N) and Germany (G). The underlying
      diseases for HPN in 494 patients were cancer (39%), Crohn's (19%), vascular
      diseases (15%), radiation enteritis (7%), AIDS (2%), other diseases with
      intestinal failure (18%). Incidence (patients/million inhabitants/year) were in N
      (3), F. (2.9), D. (2.8), B. (2.6), UK (1. 2), S (0.7) and P (0.36), respectively.
      Prevalence were in D. (12.7). U.K. (3.7), N. (3.7), F (3.6), B (3.0), P (1.1), S 
      (0.65). After this 6-12 months follow-up (n=284), the mortality was respectively 
      4% in Crohn's disease, 13% in vascular diseases, 16% in others, 21% in radiaton
      enteritis, 34% in AIDS, 74% in cancer. Incidences and prevalences modestly
      increased in these seven European countries in 1997 in comparison to 1993. The
      percentages of underlying diseases in these countries remained similar except for
      AIDS that significantly decreased (from 7% to 2%). Outcomes did not significantly
      differ in the 4-year period except for AIDS (34% instead of 88% mortality) and
      could have been related to newer, more efficacious therapy.

TI  - Oral contraceptive use and the clinical course of Crohn's disease: a prospective 
      cohort study.
PG  - 218-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: Women with Crohn's disease are usually advised not to take oral
      contraceptives, but, unlike smoking, there is no clear association between
      current oral contraceptive use and more severe disease. AIM: To assess the effect
      of oral contraceptive use on the clinical course of Crohn's disease. PATIENTS:
      331 women, aged 16-50 years, with Crohn's disease and Crohn's disease activity
      index <200, were enrolled consecutively during a one year period. Patients were
      classified at inclusion as oral contraceptive users or non-users and smokers or
      non-smokers. METHODS: A prospective 12-18 month cohort study was used. The main
      outcome measures were flare up rate and time to flare up. RESULTS: In total, 134 
      women used oral contraceptives, in most cases low oestrogen formulations. During 
      the study period, 61 oral contraceptive users (46%) developed a flare up,
      compared with 85 non-users (43%). The hazard ratio for oral contraceptive use was
      1.11 (95% confidence interval 0.80 to 1.55). Variables associated with flare up
      were smoking status, recently active disease, baseline Crohn's disease activity
      index, and presence of anoperineal lesions. The same results were obtained when
      the analysis was restricted to patients eligible for a relapse prevention trial. 
      CONCLUSION: Unlike smoking, oral contraceptives have no effect on Crohn's disease
      activity.

      disease].
PG  - 643-6
AB  - UNLABELLED: The main adverse effects of salazopyrin are usually dose-dependent
      and mild. Exceptionally, idiosyncratic reactions occur which may be
      life-threatening. CASE REPORTS: Two 10-year old children were treated for Crohn's
      disease with salazopyrin. At day 21 and day 10 respectively, pharyngitis, rash,
      and fever were noted. During the following days, high-grade fever persisted,
      while jaundice, severe cytolysis and acute liver failure also occurred. Drug
      hepatotoxicity was suspected and salazopyrin was withdrawn on day 29 and day 24
      respectively. Development of hepatic encephalopathy led to urgent liver
      transplantation in both cases. CONCLUSION: Salazopyrin is a possible cause of
      fulminant immunoallergic hepatitis. Prompt therapeutic interruption is urgent,
      but it may not alter the outcome and or preclude the need for liver
      transplantation. We suggest that salazopyrin therapy be avoided in pediatric
      inflammatory bowel disease whenever possible, and that the use of pure
      amino-salicylates be preferred.

TI  - [Diffuse jejuno-ileitis of Crohn's disease: a separate form of the disease?].
PG  - 307-11
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Diffuse jejuno-ileitis of Crohn's disease may be a
      homogeneous clinical subgroup. The aim of this work was to compare the
      demographic and clinical data at diagnosis and the initial treatments of patients
      with diffuse jejuno-ileitis of Crohn's disease and to the ones without this
      localization. PATIENTS AND METHODS: For demographic and clinical studies, 48
      (32M/16F) incident cases of diffuse jejuno-ileitis of Crohn's disease diagnosed
      between 1988 and 1994 in the EPIMAD register were compared with 96 (48M/48F)
      controls diagnosed the same year. As far as for the therapeutic management, the
      48 incident cases were compared with 48 controls. RESULTS: Diffuse jejuno-ileitis
      constituted 3.3% of the total incident cases. Median age at diagnosis was
      significantly lower (20 vs 23 years, P = 0.01) and an upper digestive involvement
      was more frequent (56% vs 34%, P = 0.03) in patients with diffuse jejuno-ileitis.
      These patients were more often treated by total parenteral nutrition (43.8% vs
      19.6%, P = 0.01) or azathioprine (50% vs 20.8%, P = 0.005). Azathioprine was also
      introduced earlier (20.7 vs 40.3 months, P = 0.009). Surgery for resection was
      less often required in diffuse jejuno-ileitis than in controls (65.2% vs 99.8%, P
      = 0.02) while more stricturoplasties were performed (52.9% vs 10%, P = 0.003);
      overall surgical rates did not significantly differ in the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: 
      Our series suggest that diffuse jejuno-ileitis of Crohn's disease is a subgroup
      of patients characterized by a young age at diagnosis, with more frequent and
      earlier requirement for azathioprine.

TI  - An audit of strictureplasty for small-bowel Crohn's disease.
PG  - 797-803
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to review the long-term outcome of
      strictureplasty for small-bowel Crohn's disease. METHODS: We reviewed 111
      patients who underwent 285 primary strictureplasties (Heineke-Mikulicz, 236;
      Finney, 49) between 1980 and 1997. RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients (78 percent)
      had had previous bowel resections. Forty-six patients (41 percent) required
      synchronous resection for perforating disease (abscess or fistula) or long
      strictures (>20 cm). The mean number of strictureplasties was three (range,
      1-11). There were no operative deaths. Septic complications (fistula or
      intra-abdominal abscess) related to strictureplasty developed in eight patients
      (7 percent), of whom two required a proximal ileostomy. Abdominal symptoms were
      relieved in 95 percent of patients. The majority (95 percent) of patients with
      preoperative weight loss gained weight (median gain, +2 kg; range, -6 to +22.3
      kg). After a median follow-up of 107 months, symptomatic recurrence occurred in
      60 patients (54 percent). In 11 patients symptomatic recurrence was successfully 
      managed by medical treatment. Forty-nine patients (44 percent) required
      reoperation for recurrence: strictureplasty alone in 22 patients, resection alone
      in 19 patients, strictureplasty and resection in 6 patients, and ileostomy alone 
      in 2 patients. Eighteen patients (16 percent) required a third operation. One
      patient died from a small-bowel carcinoma which developed in the vicinity of a
      previous strictureplasty. Two of 19 patients with diffuse jejunoileal disease
      developed short-bowel syndrome, and were receiving longterm parenteral nutrition.
      Two other patients were taking corticosteroids for recurrent symptoms. All other 
      patients were asymptomatic, receiving neither medical treatment nor nutritional
      support. CONCLUSIONS: Strictureplasty is a safe and efficacious procedure for
      small-bowel Crohn's disease in the long-term.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease in pediatric and adolescent patients.
PG  - 445-58
AB  - IBD is a chronic pediatric disease that needs to be treated by a team of experts 
      consisting of pediatricians, pediatric gastroenterologists, psychologists,
      nutritionists, social workers, and nurses. A critical factor in successful
      management of this disease is the willingness of the patient to participate and
      cooperate with the team. Parents and patients must be educated and supported to
      treat these disorders effectively. Much further research is necessary to
      understand the specific causative and therapeutic issues unique to young patients
      with IBD.

AB  - This article reviews the nutritional aspects of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) 
      including the mechanisms and manifestations of malnutrition and the efficacy of
      nutritional therapies. Nutrient deficiencies in patients with IBD occur via
      several mechanisms and may complicate the course of the disease. Nutritional
      status is assessed by clinical examination and the use of nutritional indices
      such as the Subjective Global Assessment of nutritional status. Nutritional
      intervention may improve outcome in certain individuals; however, because of the 
      costs and complications of such therapy, careful selection is warranted,
      especially in patients presumed to need parenteral nutrition.

TI  - Rapid development of severe copper deficiency in a patient with Crohn's disease
      receiving parenteral nutrition.
PG  - 169-72
AB  - A 32-year-old man with active Crohn's disease and recurrent small bowel
      strictures underwent abdominal surgery and was subsequently given total
      parenteral nutrition (TPN). Severe cholestasis developed and copper was removed
      from the TPN. Although serum ceruloplasmin levels were within normal limits, 8
      weeks after copper removal, he developed pancytopenia. Serum copper levels were
      severely depressed. Bone marrow biopsy was consistent with copper deficiency;
      cytoplasmic vacuolization of both myeloid and erythroid precursors, megaloblastic
      erthropoiesis, and marked hypocellularity were observed. IV replacement with
      copper sulfate resulted in improvement in the patient's anemia, neutropenia, and 
      thrombocytopenia, but the patient died suddenly from cardiac tamponade.
      Postmortem examination revealed fibrinous and hemorrhagic pericarditis. Despite
      the rare occurrence of overt copper deficiency, this case emphasizes the need to 
      recognize copper deficiency as an important etiology of iron-resistant anemia in 
      patients receiving TPN. Furthermore, the relative rapidity with which our patient
      developed pancytopenia suggests that, in view of the established recommendation
      that copper be removed from TPN in cholestatic conditions, serum copper levels
      must be measured periodically.

      intensive and initial maintenance therapy. Nine of the patients (50%) attained
      remission at the end of the intensive therapy. The nine non-remission patients
      had exhibited longer periods of suffering and more severely affected sites prior 
      to the therapy. In 14 of 18 patients (77.8%), the nutritional indices, Internal
      Organization of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IOIBD) score and Crohn's Disease
      Activity Index (CDAI) improved from the pretherapy levels, but only the remission
      group (50%) showed improvement in C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate (ESR). The remission group showed significantly higher
      pretherapy CD4+ CD45+ cell ratios and interleukin-2 (IL-2) production than the
      non-remission group, and significantly lower activated cells.

TI  - Incidence of dysplasia in pelvic pouches in pediatric patients after ileal
      pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 429-34
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of dysplasia 
      and the mucosal adaptation patterns of pelvic pouches in children and adolescents
      who had undergone ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis. METHODS:
      Between 1982 and 1996, 176 pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis underwent
      ilial pouch-anal anastomosis. Seventy-six patients were followed up after surgery
      at the Cleveland Clinic. Pouch biopsy specimens were reviewed for dysplasia and
      to determine mucosal adaptation patterns. Fifty-eight of the 76 patients had an
      average of three mucosal biopsies during a mean follow-up of 5 years. Demographic
      and surgical data were abstracted from archives of medical records. All
      previously obtained pouch biopsy specimens were re-evaluated by a single
      pathologist to ensure standardized interpretation. RESULTS: No dysplasia was
      identified in screening specimens of 76 children and adolescents including 5
      patients who showed dysplasia in resected colon specimens. The pattern of mucosal
      adaptation was categorized using previously reported criteria. Type A was defined
      as normal mucosa or mild villous atrophy with no or mild inflammation. Type B
      mucosa showed transient atrophy with temporary moderate inflammation followed by 
      normalization of architecture. Type C mucosa was defined as a pattern of
      persistent atrophy with severe inflammation. In the study cohort, the patterns of
      mucosal adaptation, type A (56.9%; n = 33), type B (32.8%; n = 19), and type C
      (10.3%; n = 6), were comparable with those reported in adults. The rate of pouch 
      failure and diagnosis of Crohn's disease were similar in each group and were not 
      related to the specific adaptation pattern. Most of the patients with type C
      mucosa had clinical symptoms of pouchitis requiring periodic antibiotic therapy. 
      No dysplasia was identified in any biopsy specimen reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Similar
      morphologic changes can be seen in ileal pouches in pediatric and adult patients.
      There seemed to be no increased risk of dysplasia in children and young adults
      who had undergone ilial pouch-anal anastomosis surgery for ulcerative colitis
      during a 5 year follow-up. Because the long-term risk of development of dysplasia
      is unknown, an initial screening should be performed 5 years after the creation
      of a pelvic pouch in children or when the total disease duration exceeds 7 years.
      Once identified, patients with Type C mucosa should have annual screening for
      dysplasia until further data become available.

TI  - Energy and substrate metabolism in patients with active Crohn's disease.
PG  - 844-8
AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the possible contribution of changes in
      energy metabolism and substrate oxidation rates to malnutrition in Crohn's
      disease and to assess the effect of enteral nutrition on these parameters. Energy
      metabolism was evaluated by indirect calorimetry in 32 patients with active
      Crohn's disease and 19 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals. Measurements
      were done in the postabsorptive state. Seven out of 32 patients received enteral 
      nutrition via a nasogastric tube. In these patients, resting energy metabolism
      was determined at d 0 (postabsorptive), 7, 14 (during full enteral nutrition) and
      15 (postabsorptive). Resting energy expenditure was not significantly different
      between patients and controls, whereas the respiratory quotient (RQ) was lower in
      patients (0.78 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.86 +/- 0.05; P < 0.05). During enteral nutrition in
      7 patients with Crohn's disease, the RQ increased on d 7 compared with d 0 and
      remained high even after cessation of enteral nutrition (d 0, 0.78 +/- 0.03; d 7,
      0.91 +/- 0.04; d 15, 0. 84 +/- 0.05; P < 0.05; d 7 and 15 vs. d 0). No effects of
      enteral nutrition on resting energy expenditure were found. Active Crohn's
      disease is associated with changes in substrate metabolism that resemble a
      starvation pattern. These changes appear not to be specific to Crohn's disease
      but to malnutrition and are readily reversed by enteral nutrition. Enteral
      nutrition did not affect resting energy expenditure. Wasting is a consequence of 
      malnutrition but not of hypermetabolism in Crohn's disease.

TI  - Long-term results of strictureplasty without synchronous resection for
      jejunoileal Crohn's disease.
PG  - 180-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: There have been several reports on strictureplasty for Crohn's
      disease. However, in most of them the majority of the patients underwent
      synchronous bowel resections. The efficacy of strictureplasty has been often
      attributed to the synchronous bowel resection. This study was undertaken to
      assess the long-term results of strictureplasty alone for jejunoileal Crohn's
      disease. METHODS: Forty-three patients who underwent 135 primary
      strictureplasties without synchronous resection for jejunoileal Crohn's disease
      between 1980 and 1997 were reviewed. Factors affecting reoperation rates were
      examined by using a multivariate analysis. RESULTS: There were no operative
      deaths. Intra-abdominal septic complications (abscess/fistula) developed in 4
      patients (9%). Abdominal symptoms were relieved in all but two patients, who
      required further surgery within 6 months after operation. After a median
      follow-up of 9 years 21 patients (49%) required reoperation for small-bowel
      recurrence. A multivariate analysis using Cox's proportional hazard model showed 
      that only age at operation (<35 years, hazard ratio 11.1 versus >35 years, P =
      0.002) was an independent significant factor affecting the reoperation rate. Sex,
      duration of symptoms, smoking, previous small-bowel resection, steroids use,
      preoperative nutritional status, and site, number, or length of strictureplasties
      did not affect the reoperation rates. At present all the patients are
      asymptomatic and receiving neither medical treatment nor nutritional support.
      CONCLUSIONS: Strictureplasty is a safe and efficacious procedure for jejunoileal 
      Crohn's disease in the long term. Only youth was an independent significant risk 
      factor for recurrence requiring surgery.

TI  - Growth in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 89-92
AB  - Abnormal linear growth is frequent in children and adolescents with Crohn's
      disease. The typical pattern is of growth retardation associated with delayed
      skeletal maturation. Puberty is also frequently delayed. Over 50% of patients may
      have a subnormal height velocity, and approximately 25% will have short stature. 
      The endocrine status is characterized by normal growth hormone secretion and a
      slightly subnormal serum level of insulin-like growth factor I, which is related 
      to nutritional status. Principal therapeutic options are intestinal resection for
      localized disease, and enteral nutrition--using a polymeric diet--for more
      widespread disease, particularly involving the small intestine. Growth responses 
      to both modalities are often excellent and produce considerable psychological
      benefit. Optimum therapy is achieved by close collaboration between
      gastroenterologists and endocrinologists, and by the use of auxological methods
      to document pre- and post-therapeutic management.

TI  - Assessing activity of pediatric Crohn's disease: which index to use?
PG  - 527-31
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) is a
      multi-item measure that, in contrast to the adult-derived CDAI, includes linear
      growth and places less emphasis on subjectively reported symptoms but more on
      laboratory parameters of intestinal inflammation. This study compared the
      feasibility, validity, and responsiveness of PCDAI vs. CDAI in the assessment of 
      Crohn's disease activity among pediatric patients. METHODS: Eighty-one children
      and adolescents with Crohn's disease were studied. A gastroenterologist provided 
      a categorical global assessment of disease activity as quiescent, mild, moderate,
      or severe after interview and physical examination. CDAI and PCDAI scores were
      calculated by an independent appraiser. RESULTS: Mean values within each category
      for CDAI and PCDAI differed significantly between strata. PCDAI values were
      quiescent, 6.8 +/- 6. 6; mild, 18.7 +/- 7.3; moderate, 38.5 +/- 12.9; and severe,
      54.2 +/- 14.0. CDAI values were quiescent, 23.5 +/- 53.6; mild, 96.0 +/- 60. 7;
      moderate, 184.5 +/- 97.0; and severe, 284.4 +/- 85.8. Individual scores showed
      less overlap between strata for PCDAI than for CDAI. PCDAI showed better
      correlation with serum orosomucoid and platelet count, laboratory parameters of
      inflammation not included in either index. CONCLUSIONS: Both PCDAI and CDAI
      reflect disease activity in pediatric Crohn's disease. PCDAI is better at
      discriminating between levels of disease activity.

TI  - Elevated diet-induced thermogenesis and lipid oxidation rate in Crohn disease.
PG  - 325-30
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although malnutrition is frequently observed in Crohn disease (CD),
      its cause is not clear. Regulation of energy metabolism and diet-induced
      thermogenesis (DIT) have not been adequately studied in CD. OBJECTIVE: The aim
      was to study DIT and substrate oxidation in patients with inactive ileal CD.
      DESIGN: After a test meal providing 50.2 kJ/kg body wt, DIT was assessed by
      indirect calorimetry performed over 360 min in 18 CD patients and 12 healthy
      volunteers matched for age, sex, weight, and height. Body composition was
      evaluated with the labeled-water-bolus injection technique. RESULTS: Fat-free
      mass did not differ significantly between groups, but CD patients had markedly
      lower fat mass than control subjects (13.8+/-5.63 compared with 19.0+/-3.49 kg; P
      < 0.001). Nonprotein respiratory quotient was lower in CD patients than control
      subjects (0.80+/-0.04 compared with 0.86+/-0.03; P < 0.001). Average respiratory 
      quotient between 75 and 150 min after the test meal was 0.85+/-0.03 in CD
      patients and 0.91+/-0.02 in control subjects (P < 0.001). Lipid oxidation rate
      was higher in CD patients than in control subjects (2.26+/-1.13 compared with
      1.50+/-0.75 kJ/min; P < 0.05). DIT was higher in CD patients than in control
      subjects (9.89+/-1.93% compared with 5.67+/-0.91% of energy intake; P < 0.001).
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients with inactive ileal CD had significantly higher DIT and
      lipid oxidation rate than do healthy volunteers. These results may explain why CD
      patients have difficulty maintaining adequate nutritional status, and the
      findings also suggest that a diet relatively rich in fat may attain better energy
      balance.

TI  - Effect of long-term oral glutamine supplements on small intestinal permeability
      in patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 7-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glutamine is a major fuel and an important nitrogen source for the
      small intestinal cell. It plays a key role in maintaining mucosal cell integrity 
      and gut barrier function. Increased permeability may be a factor in the
      pathogenesis of Crohn's disease and may be an interesting parameter in the
      follow-up of the disease. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine whether
      oral glutamine supplements are able to restore an increased intestinal
      permeability in patients with Crohn's disease. METHODS: The inclusion criteria
      for the study were Crohn's disease and a disturbed small intestinal permeability 
      for 51Cr-EDTA. Of 38 patients screened, 18 had an increased permeability (6 hours
      urinary excretion >1.1% of label recovered in urine). Fourteen patients were
      included in the study and were randomized to receive either oral glutamine (7 g
      three times per day; n = 7) or placebo (7 g glycine three times per day; n = 7)
      in addition to their normal treatment during a 4-week period. The study was
      performed in a double-blind manner. RESULTS: Baseline permeability (mean +/- SD) 
      was 2.32%+/-0.77% dose in the glutamine group and 2.29%+/-0.67% dose in the
      placebo group. Permeability did not change significantly after glutamine
      (3.26%+/-2.15% dose) or after placebo (2.27%+/-1.32% dose). There was no
      significant effect on plasma glutamine, plasma glutamate, plasma ammonium,
      Crohn's disease activity index, C-reactive protein, or nutritional status.
      CONCLUSIONS: Oral glutamine supplements, in the dose administered, do not seem to
      restore impaired permeability in patients with Crohn's disease.

TI  - Crohn's disease severity in familial and sporadic cases.
PG  - 91-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Having a relative with inflammatory bowel disease increases the risk 
      for Crohn's disease but may also increase its severity in affected patients.
      AIMS: To evaluate the influence of a family history on Crohn's disease course and
      severity. METHODS: 1316 patients followed in the same unit were studied
      retrospectively. Age at onset, duration of illness, site, and extent of disease
      were determined in patients with and without a family history. Additionally,
      disease severity was estimated by the need for medical therapy (steroid and
      immunosuppressive requirement) and the frequency and extent of excisional
      surgery. RESULTS: 152 (12%) patients had a family history of inflammatory bowel
      disease. Duration of follow up was longer in patients with a family history and
      there were more operations for perforating complications in familial cases.
      However, the importance of medical therapy, and the incidence and extent of
      excisional surgery were similar in familial and and sporadic cases. Kaplan-Meier 
      estimated time to prescription of immunosuppressive drugs and first intestinal
      resection were similar in familial and sporadic cases. When the 152 patients with
      familial Crohn's disease were paired for sex, location of disease at onset, date 
      of birth, and date of diagnosis with 152 patients sporadic Crohn's disease, the
      disease severity remained similar in the two groups of paired patients.
      CONCLUSION: Patients with Crohn's disease and a family history of inflammatory
      bowel disease do not have a more severe course.
