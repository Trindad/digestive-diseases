TI  - [Perineal lesions in childhood Crohn disease].
PG  - 3-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Perineal lesions (PAL) usually evolve together with bowel disease and
      often constitute a serious and disabling complication of Crohn's disease.
      PATIENTS: Forty-three children (47%) with Crohn's disease developed PAL in a
      retrospective study of 92 patients ranging in age from 4 to 20 years. RESULTS:
      PAL occurred at the mean age of 11.4 +/- 0.7 years, prior to diagnosis in 25% or 
      subsequently in 21%. PAL were severe: complex fistulae (15%), rectovaginal
      fistulae (2%), anal raggedness (13%); moderate: subcutaneous fistulae (11%),
      abscesses (19%), cavitating ulcers (9.5%) and stricture formations (5.7%); or
      mild: eczema (6.7%), fissures (57%) and skin tags (17%). An association with
      these various features has been observed in 31%. The extent of involvement of the
      gastrointestinal tract was rectosigmoid (72%), ileal and colonic (41%), ileal
      with pancolitis (12%). Two PAL course profiles were observed: one with
      exacerbation and remissions (52%), the other without remission (48%), especially 
      anal raggedness (100%), cavitating ulcers (80%) and skin tags (61%). Medical
      treatment included steroids (54%), metronidazole (53%), salicylates (51%),
      nutritional support (44%), azathioprine (17%). PAL healed in 41%. Surgical
      treatment was performed in 27% with 83% of healing. Relapses occurred in 35%
      after medical treatment and 86% after surgery.

PG  - 1056-60
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the influence of inflammatory bowel disease on pregnancy 
      and fetal outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and fifty pregnancies in 72 
      women (28 with ulcerative colitis and 44 with Crohn's disease) were compared with
      those of 150 control subjects. RESULTS: Among 150 pregnancies, 108 (group I)
      began before and 42 (group II) at the same time or after the diagnosis of
      inflammatory bowel disease. In ulcerative colitis patients, age at first
      pregnancy, mean birth weight and preterm birth rates were not different between
      groups I and II; rate of underweight offsprings was significantly higher (P <
      0.05) in group II than in group I and controls. In Crohn's disease, compared to
      group I, mean age of first pregnancy was higher (P < 0.0001), mean birth weight
      was lower (P < 0.005) and preterm birth rate was higher (P = 0.001) than in group
      II. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
      disease induce deleterious effects on pregnancy and fetal outcome.

TI  - Modulation of intestinal immune system by dietary fat intake: relevance to
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1183-90
AB  - Gut-associated lymphoid tissue is the major inductive site of the mucosal immune 
      system, which is functionally independent of the systemic immune system. Both the
      amount and type of dietary fat modulate intestinal immune function. Absorption of
      long-chain fatty acids stimulates lymphocyte flux and lymphocyte blastogenesis in
      intestinal lymphatics. Long-chain fatty acid absorption also significantly
      enhances migration of T lymphocytes to Peyer's patches, possibly due to
      up-regulation of adhesion molecules, such as alpha4-integrin and L-selectin.
      Lipoproteins are involved in stimulation of lymphocyte function by both
      receptor-dependent and independent mechanisms. However, unsaturated fatty acids
      at higher concentrations have a suppressive effect on cell-mediated immunity via 
      eicosanoid release, receptor affinity changes or interactions with intracellular 
      signal transduction. Fat absorption also influences various other cells in the
      intestinal mucosa: increased cytokine release from intestinal epithelial cells
      follows long-chain fatty acid absorption. In Crohn's disease, elemental diets and
      total parenteral nutrition often induce remission, possibly by reducing antigenic
      load on activated immune cells in the intestine and, thus, down-regulating
      hyperreactive CD4 cells. Dietary oleic acid supplements caused an immunological
      reversal effect in the intestinal immune system of animals fed an elemental diet.
      An excess of long-chain fatty acids in an elemental diet, therefore, may negate
      its beneficial effect on gut-associated lymphoid tissues in Crohn's disease. In
      contrast, supplemental dietary fish oil apparently tends to prevent relapse of
      Crohn's disease. Because dietary fat intake is closely associated with
      immunological function of the intestinal mucosa, careful manipulation of dietary 
      fat can be important in management of this disease.

TI  - [Experiences with home enteral nutrition using PEG in patients with adult Crohn's
      disease].
PG  - 689-94
AB  - In adult cases with Crohn's disease, treatment of both the disease and patients' 
      social lives is required for therapeutic regimens. Therefore, we assessed the
      safety and effectiveness of home enteral nutrition using PEG in patients with
      adult Crohn's disease. Five patients who were diagnosed with Crohn's disease
      undergoing a domiciliary treatment with enteral nutrition using PEG in The Jikei 
      University School of Medicine and related institutions from May, 1994, to July,
      1998, were the subjects of this study. All patients were relieved of symptoms and
      returned to work, one of whom relapsed two years later to undergo reoperation.
      Improvements of nutritional status and almost complete disappearance of
      inflammatory response were found in all patients. As for PEG-related
      complications, there was one case complicated with wound infection at an early
      time, and late complications, included two cases with abnormal granulation and
      one case with pain in ambient PEG. However, neither major complications nor
      complications that hindered everyday living were observed. Results of a
      questionnaire relating to this regimen showed almost complete well-being, though 
      there were complaints about limited of oral intake and the cumbersome procedure
      of enteral nutrition. In conclusion, home enteral nutrition using PEG is
      effective in maintaining relief of symptoms, both the time required for feeding
      and patient pain are less, patients can be readily socially rehabilitated, and
      complications related to PEG have been few. These suggest that it may become a
      beneficial measure for patients with adult Crohn's disease.

PG  - S3-8
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the value of superior mesenteric artery (SMA) Doppler
      flow measurements as a marker for disease activity in patients with Crohn's
      disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Duplex Doppler sonographic measurements of SMA
      bloodflow volume were obtained in 90 patients with suspected or known Crohn's
      disease in three separate studies. The first study was a pilot study to ascertain
      the value of Doppler measurements in patients with proven active or inactive
      disease and to check our performance. In two following studies prospectively a
      correlation was sought between the independent assessment of Doppler flow
      measurements and our standard of reference based on clinical history, physical
      examination, laboratory values, endoscopy, surgery and/or follow-up and
      prospectively a correlation was sought between Doppler studies and the results of
      enteroclysis. RESULTS: In all but two patients (study II) adequate measurements
      of SMA flow were obtained. In the active patient groups the Doppler SMA flow was 
      significantly increased (P < 0.05) compared to the inactive patient groups and
      the control groups. CONCLUSION: These studies show that SMA Doppler flow
      measurements can be used as a parameter to assess disease activity in patients
      with Crohn's disease.

PG  - 1652-6
AB  - In most cases a short-bowel syndrome is the consequence of extensive bowel
      resection for Crohn's disease with loss of gastrointestinal function. After
      operation the patients should be adapted to enteral feeding as soon as possible. 
      The nutritional management is determined by the type of intestinal resection and 
      length of remaining small and large bowel. Total parenteral nutrition for
      life-time is necessary in patients with less than 50 cm of small bowel. Toxic
      megacolon is a rare complication seen in Crohn's disease. Conservative therapy
      includes high doses of intravenous steroids, electrolyte replacement and
      hydration, antibiotics, decompression of the bowel as well as vigorous
      surveillance for potential complications. About 50% of the patients with toxic
      megacolon recover with conservative treatment alone. Surgical intervention should
      be performed not later than 48 hours after unsuccessful conservative therapy.

PG  - 983-95
AB  - High-dose corticosteroids remain the gold standard of therapy in acute Crohn's
      disease, but is associated with a variety of side effects. Nutritional therapy
      could be an interesting alternative, but corticosteroids are meant to be
      significantly superior according to efficacy. Published studies, identified by
      references, MEDLINE and meta-analysis, were evaluated for efficacy of nutritional
      therapy in acute Crohn's disease. In 18 evaluable of 38 identified publications, 
      571 patients were treated with nutritional therapy: 295 received elemental diet, 
      214 oligopeptide diet and 62 polymeric diet. Remission rates were 60%, 55% and
      66% respectively. However, only intention-to-treat-analysis was performed in all 
      the studies. When correcting for patients who really were treated with
      nutritional therapy, remission rates were substantially better: 73%, 70% and 67% 
      respectively, thus comparable with that of corticosteroids. Positive predictors
      for successful treatment were stenosing disease and low ESR. Remission seems to
      last as long as after corticosteroid treatment, when a reinduction diet is
      performed. Negative aspects of nutritional therapy are poor tolerance and higher 
      costs. Perspectives for the future aim on broadening of indications, improving
      acceptance (by adjuvant instead of exclusive nutrition, or new flavors) and
      efficacy by modification of compounds (such as glutamine, omega-3 fatty acids or 
      trace elements) or combination with other therapeutic agents (e.g., mesalamine).

      serum IGF-I and IGFBP-3 in patients with active Crohn's disease and have assessed
      the changes in these parameters during therapeutic intervention with enteral
      nutrition or intestinal resection. DESIGN: Children and adolescents attending the
      inflammatory bowel disease clinic at our hospital underwent treatment either with
      enteral nutrition (Study A) or intestinal resection (Study B). These are two
      separate studies and the results cannot be compared. Serum concentrations of CRP,
      IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were determined at 0, 2, 8 and 16 weeks after start of enteral 
      nutrition and in addition to height velocity, at 0 and 6 months after intestinal 
      resection. SUBJECTS: Study A: 14 patients, 9 male, 5 female, median age 12.5
      years (range 7.0-17.2), puberty stage 1 (n = 13), stage 3 (n = 1). All had active
      Crohn's disease. Study B: 9 patients, 7 male, 2 female, median age 13.5 years
      (range 7.8-16.5), puberty stage 1 (n = 5), stages 2-4 (n = 4). All had Crohn's
      disease resistant to medical therapy. METHODS: Crohn's disease was confirmed
      radiologically, endoscopically and histologically. Disease activity was scored
      using the Lloyd Still index (LSI). Study A: nutritional support was with a
      polymeric, casein-based formula feed AL 110. Study B: surgical procedures were
      small bowel resection (n = 2), right hemicolectomy (n = 5), subtotal colectomy (n
      = 2). MEASUREMENTS: Study A: weight SDS, CRP, IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 were measured at 
      0, 2, 8, 16 weeks after start of enteral feeding. Study B: height velocity, CRP, 
      IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were measured 0, 6 months after intestinal resection.
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Medians and ranges were used. Significance of changes was
      calculated using the Wilcoxon rank test for the analysis of paired data. RESULTS:
      Study A: median LSI before treatment was 39 and increased after 8 weeks of
      enteral nutrition to 60 (P < 0.05). Weight SDS increased at 8 and 16 weeks (P <
      0.05) compared to pretreatment. CRP was elevated at 0 weeks, falling during
      treatment. Median (range) values (normal < 5 mg/l) at 0 at 2, 8, 16 weeks were 53
      mg/l (15-150), 8 mg/l (5-25), 7 mg/l (5-83) and 14 mg/l (5-39), all P < 0.001
      compared with pretreatment. Median IGF-I-values increased during treatment.
      Median (range) values at 0, 2, 8, 16 weeks (all P < 0.005) compared to
      pretreatment, median (range) values at 0, 2, 8, 16 weeks were 78 micrograms/l
      (50-204), 131 micrograms/l (73-251), 119 micrograms/l (77-291) and 133
      micrograms/l (67-497), all P < 0.005 compared to pre-treatment. IGFBP-3 levels
      increased during treatment. Median (range) values at 0, 2, 8, 16 weeks were 2.4
      mg/l (1.4-3.1), 2.9 mg/l (1.8-4.6), 3.0 mg/l, 3.2 mg/l (1.8-4.5), all P < 0.01
      compared to pretreatment. Study B: height velocity increased during 6 months
      after surgery. Median (range) values; 3.3 cm/year (0-8.3) before surgery, 8.4
      cm/year (2-12.6) 6 months post-surgery, P < 0.01. Median (range) CRP values fell 
      from 45 mg/l (5-150) to 8 mg/l (5-31) and IGF-I-values increased from 163
      micrograms/l (64-286) to 226 micrograms/l (71-391). These changes were not
      statistically significant. IGFBP-3 values did not change. CONCLUSION: The IGF
      system, as shown by serum IGF-I and IGFBP-3, is responsive to therapeutic
      intervention in active Crohn's disease. It is likely that a combination of
      decreased inflammatory activity and improved nutrition contributes to these
      changes.

AB  - This case report describes our experience in treatment of a child with Crohn's
      disease involvement of ileocecal and sigmoid regions complicated with a severe
      abdominal wall abscess. A combined therapeutic approach of the acute episode was 
      based on intestinal diversion, abscess drainage, antibiotherapy, nutritional
      support and post-operative immunosuppression with azathioprine. The definitive
      treatment of the ileocolonic involvement occurred 6 months after the acute
      episode and consisted of limited resection, multiple strictureplasties, primar"
      closure of ileosigmod fistula and undiversion. This operative procedure was
      followed by a short period of total parenteral nutrition and progressive
      re-establishment ofenteric nutritional support and immunosuppression. At 18
      months follow-up, under low dose azathioprine revealed, a normal growth with a 20
      Kg weight gain and 10 cm height gain, no evidence of fistula recurrence or
      restenosis and suggests the safety of strictureplasty in paediatric patients as a
      way to conserve as much small bowel as possible.

AB  - We report a case of Crohn's disease with low serum zinc concentration in a
      26-year-old woman. She demonstrated acrodermatitis enteropathica and decreased
      visual acuity during total parenteral nutrition. Subsequent intravenous zinc
      supplementation resulted in alleviation of the skin lesions and improvement of
      visual acuity. This case supports the notion that depressed serum zinc in Crohn's
      disease may cause clinical manifestations, such as acrodermatitis enteropathica
      and retinal dysfunction, which may be correctable with zinc supplementation.

AB  - We performed randomized controlled study to compare the short-term therapeutic
      effect of total parenteral nutrition (TPN), elemental diet (ED) and polymeric
      diet (PD) given as primary therapy in active phase of Crohn's disease. In
      hospital for Crohn's disease, twenty-eight patients were given nutritional
      therapy: 9 patients by TPN, 10 by ED, and 9 by PD. Nutritional state,
      inflammatory reactions, disease activity and clinical remission rate were
      assessed two weeks and four weeks after treatment, and morphological findings
      were assessed before and after each nutritional therapy by radiographic and
      colonoscopic findings. Inflammatory reactions were more effectively controlled by
      TPN and ED than by PD, and early improvement achieved by TPN and ED was
      especially note-worthy. Clinical remission rate after treatment by TPN was
      highest in three types of nutritional approach, but no significant difference was
      seen at any point. In nutritional state, disease activity and morphological
      findings, comparable changes were effected without preference. These results
      suggest that nutritional therapy by total parenteral nutrition and elemental diet
      is superior to polymeric diet for treating active phase of Crohn's disease with
      marked inflammatory reactions.

TI  - Catheter-induced thrombus in the superior vena cava diagnosed by transesophageal 
      echocardiography.
PG  - 1227-30
AB  - BACKGROUND: To present the role of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in the 
      diagnosis and management of catheter-related superior vena cava thrombosis. CASE 
      HISTORY: A 42-year-old woman with severe Crohn's disease presented with septic
      shock and pulmonary embolism three weeks after emergency laparotomy and ileocolic
      resection for small-bowel perforation with peritonitis. Cardiopulmonary
      evaluation with ECG, pulmonary artery catheter and TEE demonstrated no evidence
      of acute myocardial ischemia or ventricular dysfunction; hemodynamic indices were
      consistent with severe sepsis. TEE revealed a large sheathing thrombus
      surrounding a central venous catheter used for parenteral nutrition. A spiral CT 
      scan of the chest confirmed multiple peripheral pulmonary emboli. Treatment
      consisted of systemic anticoagulation and antibiotics. To avoid further pulmonary
      embolism, the central venous catheter was not removed until six days later under 
      TEE monitoring, which revealed that the thrombus was firmly adherent to the
      superior vena cava. The patient made an uneventful recovery and was discharged
      from hospital on long-term anticoagulant therapy. CONCLUSION: In a case of
      catheter-induced superior vena cava thrombosis with septicemia and pulmonary
      embolism, bedside TEE was very helpful to make the correct diagnosis early,
      assess thrombus size during anticoagulation, and monitor cardiac performance and 
      thrombus disposition during central venous catheter removal.

TI  - Selenium depletion in patients with gastrointestinal diseases: are there any
      predictive factors?
PG  - 1057-61
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with intestinal disease are at risk of developing selenium
      deficiency due to impaired intestinal absorption. The aim of the present study
      was to evaluate selenium status and to identify predictive factors of selenium
      depletion in patients with gastrointestinal disease. METHODS: The concentration
      of selenium and the activity of glutathione peroxidase in plasma and erythrocytes
      were measured by fluorometry and by spectrophotometry. Eighty-six patients with
      Crohn's disease, 40 patients with ulcerative colitis, and 39 patients with
      various other gastrointestinal diseases were studied. Twenty-seven patients (16%)
      received home parenteral nutrition. Stool mass, faecal fat, and vitamin B12
      absorption were analysed in 100 patients. RESULTS: The plasma selenium
      concentration was decreased in 85% of the patients receiving supplementary
      parenteral nutrition and in 20% of the patients receiving oral nutrition, among
      them in 26% of the patients with Crohn's disease. Almost all patients with
      ulcerative colitis had normal selenium levels. A statistically significant
      correlation was found between plasma selenium and vitamin B12 absorption, stool
      mass, faecal fat excretion, body mass index, P-albumin, P-zinc, and the length of
      the remaining small bowel. Stepwise regression analyses showed that the strongest
      predictors of selenium deficiency were stool mass, vitamin B12 absorption, and
      the length of the small-bowel resection. CONCLUSION: Selenium deficiency is
      common in patients with severe gastrointestinal disorders. The deficiency is
      mainly related to malabsorption, and a low selenium level was almost invariably
      present in patients who needed parenteral supplementation due to gut failure.

TI  - Impaired splenic function and tuftsin deficiency in patients with intestinal
      failure on long term intravenous nutrition.
PG  - 759-62
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reticuloendothelial system function is impaired in humans receiving
      lipid regimens. AIMS: To evaluate the effects of long term administration of long
      chain triglyceride emulsions on reticuloendothelial system function. METHODS:
      Splenic function and tuftsin activity were measured in 20 patients on intravenous
      nutrition for intestinal failure, 20 patients with Crohn's disease who were not
      receiving intravenous nutrition, and 50 healthy controls. RESULTS: Pitted red
      cells counts in patients on intravenous nutrition (8.0%) were significantly
      higher (p<0.001) than in healthy controls (0.6%) and in patients with Crohn's
      disease (0.9%). No difference was found between healthy controls and patients
      with Crohn's disease. There was a correlation (r=0.50; p<0.03) between percentage
      of pitted red cells and duration of intravenous nutrition. Tuftsin activity was
      significantly reduced in the intravenous nutrition patient group (6%) compared
      with both disease controls (16.5%, p<0.01) and healthy volunteers (17.8%,
      p<0.001). An inverse correlation between tuftsin activity and pitted red cell
      percentage was found in the patients on intravenous nutrition (r(s) =-0.44,
      p<0.05). No relation was found in the patients on intravenous nutrition between
      pitted red cell percentage or tuftsin activity and type of disease, percentage of
      ideal body weight, residual length of small intestine, or administration
      (quantity and frequency) of lipid emulsion. Eight patients on intravenous
      nutrition had serious infections within the previous 12 months. CONCLUSIONS:
      Patients with a short bowel treated with long term intravenous nutrition have
      impaired splenic function, reduced tuftsin activity, and an increased risk of
      infection.

TI  - Intrinsic hyperreactivity of mucosal T cells to interleukin-2 in pediatric
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 675-81
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To cells play a crucial role in many chronic inflammatory diseases.
      Mucosal T cells are particularly important in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease
      (CD). We investigated the response of T cells in CD and other intestinal
      inflammatory conditions to interleukin-2 (IL-2), a cytokine essential for T-cell 
      activation, growth, and function. STUDY DESIGN: T-cell reactivity was assessed by
      measuring growth induced by IL-2 in mucosal endoscopic biopsy specimens obtained 
      from children with CD, ulcerative colitis, indeterminate colitis, and chronic
      nonspecific colitis and from children without gastrointestinal inflammation.
      RESULTS: CD mucosal T cells grew remarkably and significantly more than T cells
      from normal, ulcerative colitis, and chronic nonspecific colitis mucosa. T cells 
      from indeterminate colitis mucosa grew similarly to those of CD mucosa. The
      enhanced growth response in CD was independent of disease location, presence or
      absence of intestinal inflammation, treatment, disease duration, or clinical
      activity. CONCLUSION: Mucosal T cells from children with CD exhibit an intrinsic 
      hyperreactivity to IL-2. This may represent a primary pathogenic abnormality in
      this condition.

TI  - Ongoing advances in inflammatory bowel diseases, including maintenance therapies,
      biologic agents, and biology of disease.
PG  - 499-506
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases remain a significant chronic disease affecting
      children and adolescents. Although corticosteroids remain the standard form of
      therapy for many patients, an era of biological agents for therapy in
      inflammatory bowel diseases is upcoming with human trials using these agents now 
      forthcoming. In addition, studies on maintenance of remission are beginning to
      address the selection of those patients most likely to benefit from
      aminosalicylate therapies, the risks of relapse from using cyclooxygenase
      inhibitors, the lack of benefit from lipoxygenase inhibitors, and possible future
      methodologies to examine the effectiveness of the immuno-suppressive agent
      6-mercaptopurine. Further development of the hypothesis that new-onset disease
      may be different than longstanding disease can be appreciated with reports of
      cytokine analysis in new-onset inflammation and the high risk of progression of
      disease in new-onset ulcerative proctitis in children. With more reports on the
      role of intestinal epithelial cells in intestinal diseases, it is now clear that 
      this cell layer is not a passive bystander with regard to the interactions
      between the luminal contents and immune system components found within the lamina
      propria; new studies suggest that novel therapeutic strategies may be possible.
      This review summarizes recently reported aspects of Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis, with an emphasis on issues-pertinent for younger patients.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 788-91
AB  - Many nutritional issues are important in the care of children and adolescents
      with inflammatory bowel disease. No specific dietary toxin or antigen has been
      identified to have an etiologic role in either ulcerative colitis or Crohn's
      disease. A possible modulating effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on
      intestinal inflammation is being investigated. Most prevalent among the
      nutritional consequences of inflammatory bowel disease is weight loss, for which 
      inadequate caloric intake is primarily responsible. Impairment of linear growth
      and associated delay in pubertal development commonly complicate childhood
      Crohn's disease. The two major etiologic factors are chronic undernutrition and
      direct effects of inflammatory mediators secreted from the inflamed gut. Recent
      studies have incriminated interleukin-6. Treatment of intestinal inflammation and
      provision of adequate nutrition are of paramount importance in preventing or
      remedying growth impairment. Exclusive enteral nutrition using formulated food is
      efficacious primary therapy of active Crohn's disease, although the mode of
      action is poorly understood.

TI  - Local and systemic effects of macrophage cytokines in intestinal inflammation.
PG  - 780-3
AB  - The activation of macrophages and newly recruited monocytes appears to be common 
      to both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, despite different inductive
      stimuli. Similar activation occurs acutely during the course of invasive
      intestinal infections such as shigellosis, but is then usually downregulated. The
      macrophage cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 (IL-1) are
      centrally involved in the local inflammatory response, and blockade of either
      cytokine greatly attenuates the inflammatory lesion. Induction of focal vascular 
      thrombosis and matrix degradation are thought to be an important component of
      this focal damage. Both cytokines and IL-6 are now recognized to contribute to
      the systemic effects of intestinal disease, including growth suppression,
      anorexia, and chronic anemia. Disturbance of sleep patterns, mood, and affect may
      also occur, and recent evidence points towards bidirectional interplay between
      macrophage cytokines and central nervous system function.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the risk and predictive factors for colonic extension in
      patients with ileal Crohn's disease. METHODS: One hundred and fifty patients with
      ileal Crohn's disease and no specific colonic lesions on initial colonoscopy were
      studied retrospectively (median follow-up: 51 months). RESULTS: Twelve patients
      (8%) developed colonic lesions. Ten-year cumulated risks (95% confidence
      interval) for colonic extension were 17.2% (range: 5.8-28.6) in the whole group, 
      and 22.4% (range: 8.7-36.1) in the group of 86 patients with repeated
      colonoscopy. Young age at diagnosis was the only factor predicting colonic
      extension. Seven patients with colonic extension required immunosuppressive
      therapy but none underwent surgery. CONCLUSION: Ileal Crohn's disease has a low
      tendency for colonic extension. Colonic extension has no major prognostic
      implications.

TI  - Diagnostic accuracy of serological assays in pediatric inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 822-9
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Accurate serological assays are desirable for the diagnosis of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) types in the pediatric age group. The aim of
      this study was to test the diagnostic accuracy of modified assays for perinuclear
      (p) antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) and anti-Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae antibodies (ASCAs) in patients with pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC) 
      and Crohn's disease (CD) and in those without IBD. METHODS: With observers
      blinded to patients' diagnoses, serum specimens were analyzed for immunoglobulin 
      (Ig) A and IgG ASCAs and ANCAs by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The
      perinuclear location of ANCAs visualized by indirect immunofluorescence was
      confirmed by its disappearance after administration of deoxyribonuclease.
      RESULTS: IgA and IgG ASCA titers were significantly greater and highly specific
      for CD (95% for either, 100% if both positive). pANCA was 92% specific for UC and
      absent in all non-IBD controls. The majority of patients with CD positive for
      pANCA had a UC-like presentation. Disease location, duration, activity,
      complications, and treatment with immunosuppressive drugs did not have an impact 
      on the ASCA or pANCA assay results. After resection, UC patients remained pANCA
      positive, in contrast to patients with CD, in whom ASCA titers decreased toward
      normal values postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: ASCA and pANCA assays are highly
      disease specific for CD and UC, respectively. These serological tests can assist 
      clinicians in diagnosing and categorizing patients with IBD and may be useful in 
      making therapeutic decisions.

TI  - [Standardized enteroclysis. Monitoring of intra-lumen pressure in 3 different
      patient groups].
PG  - 624-31
AB  - PURPOSE: Monitoring of intraluminal pressure in standardized enteroclysis.
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Pressure monitoring with a double-lumen tube during
      fluoroscopy-guided adjustment of contrast media instillation rate due to small
      bowel motility and contrast media transport of 67 patients. Stratification
      according to patient data and findings in enteroclysis: Crohn's disease (n = 12),
      non-inflammatory disease (n = 35) and irritable bowel syndrome (n = 20). RESULTS:
      The amount, instillation period and rate of contrast media and distension media
      were not statistically different within the study population. Crohn's disease
      patients showed elevated intraluminal pressure at the end of the distension phase
      (47.94 +/- 10.42 cm H2O versus 38.03 +/- 10.08 and 39.55 +/- 9.74 cm H2O,
      respectively, P = 0.0099), as well as at the end of the examination (48.59 +/-
      10.42 cm H2O versus 39.66 +/- 6.52 and 35.67 +/- 8.28 cm H2O, P = 0.0002). In
      comparison with both other patient groups, maximum intraluminal pressure in
      Crohn's disease is higher and totals 51.75 +/- 9.94 cm H2O versus 43.00 +/- 6.20 
      and 39.55 +/- 9.74 cm H2O, P = 0.0010. Patients with Crohn's disease require a
      longer instillation period of distension media (28.05 +/- 12.82 min, not
      statistically significant). CONCLUSION: Intraluminal pressure differs in
      standardized enteroclysis with fluoroscopy-guided instillation rate adjustment.
      Irrespective of stenosis or acute inflammation, patients with Crohn's disease
      show a higher intraluminal pressure compared to patients with non-inflammatory
      disease or irritable bowel syndrome.

TI  - Highly destructive perianal Crohn's disease.
PG  - 491-2
AB  - This article reports a case of highly destructive perianal Crohn's disease in a
      15-year-old boy who presented with fecal impaction and incontinence. Both upper
      and lower gastrointestinal tract endoscopy were unrevealing. Treatment with
      intravenous prednisolone and broad-spectrum antibiotics supplemented by enteral
      feeding with an elemental diet resulted in prompt recovery. However, healing of
      his perianal lesions began only after a diverting colostomy. Awareness of this
      uncommon entity is important because prompt recognition can lead to early
      institution of appropriate treatment and avoid further morbidity.

TI  - Crohn's disease in adolescents.
PG  - 115-32
AB  - The clinical features of Crohn's disease manifest during adolescence are varied
      as in adults. The potential complication of growth impairment and concomitant
      delay in pubertal development is unique to this population. Cytokines released
      from the inflamed bowel and chronic nutritional insufficiency are the major
      factors in the pathophysiology of growth inhibition. Hence reduction of
      intestinal inflammation and consistent provision of adequate nutrition are of
      paramount importance in management. Drug treatment mirrors that of adults; few
      specifically paediatric clinical trials have been conducted. Enteral nutrition is
      an important therapeutic alternative for young patients. There is evidence that
      it constitutes both a primary therapy of inflammation and a means of providing
      the calories needed for growth. In the setting of extensive disease, dependency
      on corticosteroids should be minimized through judicious administration of
      immunosuppressive drugs. For an adolescent with localized stenotic disease,
      optimal management includes a timely referral for intestinal resection as a means
      of providing an asymptomatic interval during which growth and pubertal
      development can normalize.

TI  - Crohn's disease: nutrition and nutritional therapy.
PG  - 93-114
AB  - Disordered nutrition is common in Crohn's disease and is multifactorial. Regular 
      and systematic monitoring of at least a minimum set of nutrition data is an
      essential component of care of children and adults with Crohn's disease. However,
      even in children, monitoring of growth and development may be deficient. Multiple
      macro- and micronutrient deficiencies are common in Crohn's disease, especially
      in those with extensive small bowel deficiencies or after multiple surgical
      resections. Body composition analysis may show differences from simple
      starvation, and metabolic effects of inflammation are increasingly being
      recognized. Nutritional support is part of the management of all patients with
      Crohn's disease, but nutritional intervention with defined formula liquid diet is
      an effective specific anti-inflammatory therapy. Although meta-analysis of
      published trials suggest that steroids are more effective than defined formula
      liquid diets, objective evidence from whole gut lavage fluid analysis and from
      faecal excretion of radiolabelled leukocytes shows unequivocal benefit of
      elemental diet based on measuring parameters of tissue damage. Enteral feeding
      with liquid diets should be considered in patients with incomplete small bowel
      obstruction, severe painful perianal disease, failure of corticosteroids in
      active Crohn's disease, borderline intestinal failure and in children with active
      Crohn's disease or with growth failure.

TI  - Cutaneous advancement flap closure: alternative method for treatment of
      complicated anal fistulas.
PG  - 884-6; discussion 886-7
AB  - PURPOSE: A retrospective chart review of 20 consecutive patients with 23 anal
      fistulas treated with cutaneous advancement flap closure was undertaken to
      ascertain the efficacy of this previously unreported technique. METHODS: The
      so-called "diamond" and "house" flaps are commonly used to treat anal stenosis,
      and mucosal advancement flaps are successfully used to close fistulas. The
      authors began, in 1994, to close selected fistulas with skin advancement flaps
      after suture closure of the internal opening and adequate drainage of the
      external opening. Fourteen patients (4 females; average age, 42 years; a total of
      14 fistulas) without inflammatory bowel disease and 6 patients (3 females;
      average age, 35 years) with inflammatory bowel disease (5 with Crohn's disease; 1
      with chronic ulcerative colitis; a total of 8 fistulas) were treated. Indications
      were low internal opening with transsphincteric fistula in both groups. Mucosal
      advancement was relatively contraindicated, either because of fear of ectropion
      or, in the inflammatory bowel disease patients, diseased mucosa. No one in the
      noninflammatory bowel disease group was diverted or kept without anything by
      mouth, and all were treated as outpatients or with overnight observation. The
      inflammatory bowel disease group was either diverted (1 patient) or kept on home 
      total parenteral nutrition (5 patients) for three to six weeks. Cyclosporine,
      antibiotics, 5-acetylsalicylic acid, and other medications were used judiciously 
      in the inflammatory bowel disease group. RESULTS: In the noninflammatory bowel
      disease group, complete healing of all wounds occurred in 11 patients in an
      average of 6.5 weeks (average follow-up, 18 months). Complications included donor
      site separation in two patients and minor incontinence of flatus in one patient. 
      In the inflammatory bowel disease group, five fistulas healed, two failed, and
      one patient developed a new fistula during an average follow-up of 16 months.
      Deep venous thrombosis and catheter sepsis occurred in one patient in this group.
      There were no fatalities in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Although the numbers,
      especially in the inflammatory bowel disease group, are very small, the results
      are encouraging. This technique appears to have a place in the armamentarium of
      the surgeon repairing anal fistulas.

TI  - Metabolic features of inflammatory bowel disease in a remission phase of the
      disease activity.
PG  - 339-47
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the anthropometric and metabolic characteristics of
      patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), comparing both
      groups with healthy volunteers. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SETTING: The
      Department of Internal Medicine, Catholic University Hospital, Rome, Italy.
      SUBJECTS: Thirty-four patients with biopsy-proven inflammatory bowel disease (18 
      CD; 16 UC) in clinical remission (SCDAI < 3 and Powell-Tuck index < 4) not
      receiving steroid therapy. INTERVENTIONS: All patients had a clinical
      examination. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Blood indicators of inflammation and
      nutritional status. Body composition was assessed by both anthropometry and
      bioimpedance and metabolic variables were measured by indirect calorimetry over a
      60-90 min period. RESULTS: CD had a lower body weight than both controls (58.1
      kg, range 41.5-71.0 vs. 66.4 kg, range 57.0-76.0; P < 0.001) and UC) 58.1 kg,
      range 41.5-71.0 vs. 69.6 kg, range 50.5-94.0; (P < 0.001). Fat-free mass (FFM)
      did not differ between the groups, whilst fat mass was significantly lower in CD 
      than in UC (P < 0.05) and controls (P < 0.001). Normalizing the basal metabolic
      rate by FFM, a higher value was found in CD compared with UC (143 kJ kg-1)
      d-(-1), range 97.5-179 vs. 133 kJ kg-1 d-1, range 123-148; P < 0.05) and control 
      subject 143 kj kg-1 d-1, range 97.5-179 vs. 134 kj kg-1 d-1, range 122-162; P <
      0.05). The nonprotein respiratory quotient was significantly lower in CD compared
      to UC 0.80, range 0.73-0.84 vs. 0.84, range 0.79-0.91; P < 0.01) and controls
      (0.80, range 0.73-0.84 vs. 0.83, range 0.81-0.87; P < 0.001), with a consequently
      higher lipid oxidation rate in CD. CONCLUSIONS: CD subjects showed a decreased
      fat mass and enhanced utilization of lipids compared with UC and controls. These 
      data could be explained by the larger intestinal involvement and considered as a 
      contribution to lipid tissue wasting in CD.

TI  - [Surgical concepts in Crohn disease of the terminal ileum and colon].
PG  - 331-7
AB  - Most patients with Crohn's disease have to be operated on. Necessity to loose
      some amount of the intestine and time-point of the surgical intervention may be
      derived from the irreversible cascade of the inflammatory process and the
      limitations of the conservative treatment. In ileocecal disease indications for
      surgery are represented by stenotic and/or penetrating complications of the
      inflamed bowel, whereas in Crohn's colitis acute or terminal medical refractority
      is predominating. Standard-procedures result from constantly definable patterns
      of the disease manifestation: ileocecal resection and colectomy/-proctocolectomy.
      In segmental colitis sometimes "resections within Crohn's" may be adequate in a
      first attempt to avoid anticipating the natural course by surgical means. In
      these cases the further prognosis depends on the treatment possibilities of the
      remaining colon. In contrast, true recurrence is a new inflammation of the
      neoterminal ileum and may indicate repeated resections. The frequence decreases
      with the number of resections. Nevertheless nutritional status is restored even
      by multiple resections, whereas specific functional sequelae of the
      resection--distal resection- and dehydration syndromes--are well treatable
      mostly. In the case of appropriate timing of the operation and the reoperation
      operative morbidity and mortality are remarkable low today resulting in an almost
      normal life expectancy. Most important as negative prognostic factor remains
      sepsis resulting from pre-existing or postoperative infectious complications.
      Keeping this in mind experimental pharmaco-therapy to delay the operation and not
      profoundly substantiated tendencies to minimize surgery are to be considered only
      with critical scepticism. At the moment, future research is thought to be more
      successful in focussing prophylaxis of ileal recurrence than avoiding surgery.

TI  - Appropriate nutritional support in acute and complicated Crohn's disease.
PG  - 462-5
AB  - Crohn's disease is frequently complicated by protein-calorie malnutrition. Four
      common clinical presentations of Crohn's disease include acute exacerbations or
      flares of disease, intestinal obstruction, fistulizing disease, and perianal
      disease. In this review, we examine the role of nutritional support in these
      clinical scenarios. Nutritional support is important for maintaining functional
      status and preventing loss of lean tissue. Determinants of lean-tissue loss
      include severity of underlying injury, baseline nutritional status, and duration 
      of inadequate nutrition. One of the clinically useful measures of nutritional
      status is the nutritional risk index (NRI) defined on the basis of the serum
      albumin and weight loss. Nutritional support is important in severely
      malnourished patients (NRI < 83). Enteral nutrition is the route of choice,
      provided there are no contraindications to using the gastrointestinal tract. In
      acute exacerbations of Crohn's disease, enteral nutrition also has a role in the 
      primary management of disease although it is not as effective as corticosteroids 
      in inducing remission. The mechanisms are poorly understood and the most
      effective enteral formulation needs to be determined. Total parenteral nutrition 
      is justified in severely malnourished Crohn's disease patients who are unable to 
      tolerate enteral feeding or in whom enteral feeding is contraindicated. More
      clinical studies are needed on the assessment of malnutrition in Crohn's disease,
      the effects of nutritional management on functional status, and the timing of
      nutritional intervention.

TI  - Childhood Crohn's disease and the efficacy of enteral diets.
PG  - 345-50
AB  - Enteral diets, both elemental and, more recently, polymeric (whole protein), are 
      used as primary therapy in Crohn's disease and can induce disease remission
      without the concomitant use of immunosuppressive drugs. Controlled trials
      comparing enteral nutrition with corticosteroid therapy have given mixed results 
      but suggest, at least in children, that they are as effective as corticosteroids 
      in inducing remission. There is no clear consensus as to which dietary therapy is
      best. Elemental diets do not seem to be superior to polymeric whole protein-based
      diets, although further work is necessary. The effect of enteral diets does not
      seem to be related to the site of intestinal inflammation. Enteral nutrition is
      particularly appropriate in children and adolescents with Crohn's disease,
      improving nutrition and promoting growth and pubertal development, and avoiding
      the systemic toxicity of corticosteroid therapy. Most centers will use it as a
      first line of treatment. Supplementary enteral nutrition after primary therapy
      and remission induction may be associated with the prolongation of remission and 
      promotion of linear growth. Pathways by which enteral diets may affect mucosal
      inflammation are discussed. Enteral diets may inhibit intestinal immune responses
      by reducing the number of cytokine-producing cells. Enteral nutrition may also
      boost immunosuppressive pathways, which then endogenously suppress ongoing
      inflammation. Enteral diets may promote epithelial healing and
      reepithelialization of Crohn's ulcers and may also reduce the bacterial load in
      the small bowel.

AB  - A case of severe bone pain associated with cyclosporin therapy for Crohn's
      disease is reported. Severe leg pain developed in a 32-year-old man who was
      receiving cyclosporin for Crohn's disease that was refractory to medical
      management. Leg pain was related to the dose of cyclosporin, improved with
      calcium channel blockade, and resolved on discontinuation of cyclosporin. This
      syndrome has been described in the renal transplantation literature and may be
      related to vasoconstriction of bone vasculature.

TI  - Serum leptin in children and young adults with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 500-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease is often associated with growth 
      failure and inadequate energy intake. Although several circulating cytokines are 
      known to be elevated in inflammatory bowel disease, the mechanism for the related
      anorexia has not been described. Leptin is a newly recognized circulating protein
      that is an important regulator of appetite and energy metabolism; leptin levels
      are elevated in several animal models of inflammation. This study was conducted
      to determine whether serum leptin levels are elevated in young patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: One hundred twelve children and young adults
      with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis were studied prospectively. Forty-two 
      patients with other gastrointestinal illnesses were used as control subjects.
      Height, weight, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum albumin concentration, and 
      clinical information were collected prospectively, and leptin was measured by
      radioimmunoassay of stored serum. RESULTS: No significant differences in leptin
      levels were found among disease groups or control subjects. Body mass index and
      gender were the only independent predictors of serum leptin in all groups
      examined. Disease activity varied inversely with serum leptin in patients with
      Crohn's disease, but these differences were explained entirely by variations in
      body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: The determinants of serum leptin were the same in
      young patients with inflammatory bowel disease as in normal populations,
      indicating that alterations in leptin levels are unlikely to mediate the anorexia
      and growth failure associated with this disease.

TI  - Nutritional factors in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 235-7
AB  - During the past 20 years there has been growing interest in the importance of
      nutritional factors in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. There are 
      so far no definite links between ulcerative colitis and diet, but links with
      Crohn's disease have been studied by both epidemiologists and clinicians.
      Epidemiological studies, although retrospective, have suggested that patients
      with Crohn's disease eat more sugar and sweets that control individuals; however,
      when dietary sugar is restricted, there is little clinical benefit. The clinical 
      approach to nutrition in Crohn's disease has been by the use of elemental diets, 
      which will produce symptomatic and objective remission in up to 90% of compliant 
      patients. Those who return to normal eating soon relapse but, in some studies,
      have enjoyed prolonged remission on exclusion diets. The foods excluded have been
      not sugar, but predominantly cereals, dairy products and yeast. Attention has now
      switched to the possible harmful role of fat in Crohn's disease. The efficacy of 
      elemental feeds appears to depend not on the presentation of nitrogen but on the 
      amount of long chain triglyceride present. Increases in recent years in the
      frequency of Crohn's disease in Japan have been correlated with increased dietary
      fat intake, and a recent study suggested that W-3 fatty acids, which are
      metabolized by immunomodulatory leukotrienes and prostaglandins, may have a
      beneficial role to play. The links between nutrition and Crohn's disease have now
      become strong and the role of fat may be the most exciting of all.

TI  - Comprehensive nutritional status in patients with long-standing Crohn disease
      currently in remission.
PG  - 919-26
AB  - Malnutrition is observed frequently and is an important complication in patients 
      with Crohn disease (CD). The pathophysiology of malnutrition in this disorder is 
      complex. To obtain a comprehensive picture of nutritional status in patients with
      long-standing CD that was clinically in remission, we assessed four measures of
      nutritional status in 32 patients (18 women and 14 men) and 32 matched healthy
      control subjects: 1) body composition, 2) dietary intake, 3) biochemical indexes 
      of nutrition, and 4) and muscle strength (as a functional index). Mean daily
      intakes of fiber and phosphorus were significantly lower in CD patients than in
      control subjects. Serum concentrations of several nutrients (beta-carotene,
      vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium, and zinc) and activity of the enzyme glutathione 
      peroxidase were also significantly lower in CD patients, as were antioxidant
      status and serum concentrations of magnesium and vitamin D. Percentage body fat
      and hamstring muscle strength were significantly lower in male CD patients than
      in control subjects, whereas muscle strength of the quadriceps was preserved. In 
      conclusion, this study showed a variety of nutritional and functional
      deficiencies in patients with long-standing CD in remission, especially in male
      patients with a high lifetime prednisone dose. A comprehensive nutritional
      assessment seems superior to the assessment of a single dimension of nutritional 
      status.

PG  - 289-98
AB  - Malnutrition is a very common situation in patients inflammatory with intestinal 
      disease (IID), which can be caused by a multitude of factors. It has been shown
      that nutritional support not only improves the nutritional condition of the
      patients, but in Crohn's disease it also has an effect on the activity of the
      disease, although this effect is smaller than that of steroids. Elemental diets
      are no more efficient than polymeric diets except under very special
      circumstances, but they are more expensive and patients tolerate them worse. A
      digestive pause is not recommended unless there is an absolute contraindication
      for the use of the digestive tract. Therefore, parenteral nutrition, which is
      more expensive and can cause serious complications, will be reserved for very
      specific indications. The use of fish oil supplements, either because it competes
      with arachidonic acid and prevents the initiation of the inflammatory cascade, or
      because it decreases the production of cytokines, has shown to be potentially
      useful in inflammatory intestinal disease, and this must be confirmed by further 
      studies. Short chain fatty acids enemas have shown promising results in distal
      ulcerative colitis but the lack of homogeneity in the studies makes it necessary 
      for these results to be consolidated in new studies. Nutritional support is
      especially interesting in children with inflammatory intestinal disease given
      that the growth retardation which is often seen in severe cases, can be
      controlled by adequate enteral or parenteral diets.

TI  - Nutritional therapy in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 45-53
AB  - The value of nutritional support in the prevention and treatment of malnutrition 
      in Crohn's disease is undisputed but its role in primary therapy continues to be 
      debated. Controlled trials have demonstrated that enteral nutrition induces
      remission rates comparable to that of corticosteroid therapy in Crohn's disease
      and remains the treatment of choice for specific subgroups such as children with 
      signs of growth impairment and patients with intolerable steroid-induced side
      effects. The mechanism by which an enteral diet induces remission in Crohn's
      disease is unclear. Bowel rest, reduced antigenic load, nutritional effects, the 
      provision of trophic amino acids, modification of gut flora, intestinal
      permeability, or fecal pH have been proposed. Equally, the fat profile of the
      feed may reduce pro-inflammatory ecosanoid synthesis and thus modify disease
      activity. Maintaining long-term remission remains a challenge in the management
      of this disease. Cyclic administration of enteral diets, maintenance drug
      therapy, fat manipulated formulas, or fish oil therapy may be strategies to
      prolong diet-induced remission. In the future, nutrient derivatives that play a
      role in the protective processes of the intestinal mucosa may have application in
      nutritional therapy in Crohn's disease.

TI  - Medical management of perianal Crohn's disease.
PG  - 10-4
AB  - Perianal disease is a frequent complication necessitating both medical and
      surgical management in Crohn's disease. Fissures, fistulae, or abscesses are
      found in approximately 36% of patients; occur more often in the ileocolonic and
      colonic disease; and may precede the onset of intestinal symptoms (Farmer et al, 
      Gastroenterology 68:627-635, 1975; Rankin et al, Gastroenterology 77:914-920,
      1979; Gray et al, Gut 6:515-524, 1965; and Homan et al, Arch Surg 111:1333-1335, 
      1976). To approach perianal manifestations, the physician must identify the
      anatomic location of the disease, treat the suppurative complications, and
      consider a long-term approach to palliation of chronic inflammatory sequelae.
      This article will review the medical management of perianal Crohn's disease and
      indications for surgery.

TI  - Bone mineral density and nutritional status in children with chronic inflammatory
      bowel disease.
PG  - 188-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis has been reported in adult patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease. AIMS: To evaluate bone mineral density (BMD), nutritional status, 
      and determinants of BMD in children with inflammatory bowel disease. PATIENTS:
      Fifty five patients (34 boys and 21 girls, age range 4-18) were studied; 22 had
      Crohn's disease and 33 ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Lumbar spine and total body
      BMD, and body composition were assessed by dual energy x ray absorptiometry
      (DXA). Results were expressed as standard deviation scores (SDS). Lean body mass 
      was also assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Yearly measurements 
      during two years were performed in 21 patients. RESULTS: The mean SDS of lumbar
      spine BMD and total body BMD were significantly lower than normal (-0.75 and
      -0.95, both p < 0.001). Height SDS and body mass index SDS were also decreased.
      The decrease in BMD SDS could not be explained by delay in bone maturation. The
      cumulative dose of prednisolone correlated negatively with lumbar spine BMD SDS
      (r = -0.32, p < 0.02). Body mass index SDS correlated positively with total body 
      BMD SDS (r = 0.36, p < 0.02). Patients with Crohn's disease had significantly
      lower lumbar spine and total body BMD SDS than patients with ulcerative colitis, 
      even after adjustment for cumulative dose of prednisolone. In the longitudinal
      data cumulative dose of prednisolone between the measurements correlated
      negatively with the change in lumbar spine and total body BMD SDS. Lean tissue
      mass measured by DXA had a strong correlation with lean body mass measured by BIA
      (r = 0.98). CONCLUSIONS: Children with inflammatory bowel disease have a
      decreased BMD. Children with Crohn's disease have a higher risk of developing
      osteopaenia than children with ulcerative colitis. Corticosteroid therapy and
      nutritional status are important determinants of BMD in these patients.

TI  - Crohns disease in Slovakia: prevalence, socioeconomic and psychological analysis.
PG  - 49-53
AB  - The need for a basic epidemiological study, according to international standards,
      of the prevalence of IBD in Slovakia was increased by the dissolution of
      Czechoslovakia. This paper presents the results of CD prevalence to 30 April 1994
      in Slovakia. To evaluate the statistical data of the prevalence of the disease
      according to age, sex, regions and districts, the authors employed the
      multi-dimensional Kruskal-Wallis test and cluster analysis and determined that
      the prevalence of CD in Slovakia is 6.75/100.000 inhabitants. The distribution
      differences indicate the need for further investigations of environmental
      differences. The socio-economic and psychological evaluation of the patients
      examined revealed some interesting associations. The psychological reaction to
      the disease is neurotic and depressive and a higher occurrence of affective
      symptomatology was observed in patients with permanent partnership and with
      children. On the other hand, the educational level and knowledge concerning the
      disease on the part of the patient had a positive influence on the reaction to
      the disease.

TI  - Crohn's disease stable remission after human immunodeficiency virus infection.
PG  - 412-9
AB  - We retrospectively assessed the clinical course in four patients with
      long-standing Crohn's disease who became infected with human immunodeficiency
      virus (HIV). The duration of active Crohn's disease was 21, 10, 4, and 4 years in
      our four patients. They experienced a stable remission of Crohn's disease
      symptoms after HIV infection. In three patients Crohn's disease was in stable
      remission for 5, 8, and 8 years after HIV infection and all three died from
      acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related disease. One patient was still alive
      without recurrence of Crohn's disease symptoms 7 years following HIV detection.
      Our observations of a spontaneous improvement in the clinical course of Crohn's
      disease after HIV infection, suggests that the integrity of the immune response, 
      especially that of CD4 T cells, plays a major role in the tissue injury mechanism
      in Crohn's disease.

TI  - Severe muscle damage induced by high carbohydrate intake from elemental diet in a
      patient with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 121-4
AB  - Crohn's disease is associated with complications in multiple organs. However,
      there are very few reported cases of patients with Crohn's disease with muscle
      symptoms and/or high serum creatine phospho-kinase (CPK) levels. We report here a
      patient with Crohn's disease who experienced skeletal muscle damage with
      extremely high serum CPK level during treatment with an elemental diet. The
      non-parenteral administration of large amounts of carbohydrate and limited
      glycogen degradation capability may be a possible causative mechanism for this
      elemental diet-induced muscle damage.

TI  - Activated protein C resistance in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 172-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is evidence for a hypercoagulable state in inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD), and small vessel thrombosis has been identified in the bowel of
      patients with Crohn's disease, suggesting thrombosis as a possible etiologic
      factor. Activated protein C (APC) resistance is the most common inherited
      disorder leading to thrombosis and accounts for 30% to 40% of episodes of
      idiopathic venous thrombosis. METHODS: The prevalence of APC resistance was
      studied in 23 patients with IBD (17 with Crohn's disease, 6 with ulcerative
      colitis) and in 11 control subjects with recurrent abdominal pain or celiac
      disease, using an APC resistance screening method. RESULTS: One patient with
      Crohn's disease had a positive screen result, two patients (one with Crohn's, one
      with ulcerative colitis) had borderline results, and results in all of the
      control subjects were normal. One patient with Crohn's disease had a history of a
      thromboembolic event but had a normal screen result. CONCLUSIONS: Activated
      protein C resistance does not seem to play a major role in the etiology of the
      hypercoagulable state in inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Vitamins A and E serum levels in children and young adults with inflammatory
      bowel disease: effect of disease activity.
PG  - 129-35
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypovitaminosis and fat-soluble vitamin deficiency have been reported
      in adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A prospective study was
      undertaken to determine the prevalence of low serum levels of vitamins A and E in
      children and young adults with IBD. METHODS: Clinical information and serum for
      vitamin levels was gathered prospectively from 61 patients with Crohn's disease, 
      36 patients with ulcerative colitis, and 23 control subjects. Disease activity
      and disease location were determined for IBD patients. Serum retinol and
      alpha-tocopherol levels were determined by high-performance liquid
      chromatography. RESULTS: The prevalence of hypovitaminosis A (defined as serum
      vitamin A < 20 micrograms/dl) or hypovitaminosis E (defined as serum vitamin E < 
      5 mg/l) was 16% in the pediatric IBD population studied. Low vitamin A levels
      were more common than low vitamin E levels. Serum retinol levels correlated
      significantly with alpha-tocopherol levels. Hypovitaminosis was significantly
      more prevalent in the Crohn's disease patients who had active disease, an
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate of more than 25 mm/hour, or a serum albumin level 
      less than 3 mg/dl. CONCLUSIONS: Children and young adults with active IBD
      frequently have low serum levels of vitamin A or vitamin E. The severity of
      disease activity is a better predictor of risk for hypovitaminosis than is
      nutritional status. Further work is necessary to determine whether the
      hypovitaminosis seen in children with IBD reflects true deficiency.

TI  - Therapy of Crohn's disease in childhood.
PG  - 593-610
AB  - The aim of therapy in Crohn's disease in childhood is to induce and to maintain a
      remission of disease activity so that normal growth and development of the child 
      may occur. Enteral nutrition may now be recommended as the first-line treatment
      for most children with Crohn's disease. However, the evidence for remission is
      better for children with Crohn's disease of the small intestine rather than of
      the large intestine. There is evidence that amino acid feeds (elemental), whole
      protein (polymeric) and protein hydrolysate feeds (semi-elemental) may all be
      successful. Such a therapeutic approach can lead to healing of the mucosa and
      down-regulation of inflammation. However, in some cases surgery is required,
      particularly in children with growth failure and delayed puberty. Drug therapy
      also continues to have a role in therapy especially with severe colonic disease.

TI  - Twenty-four-hour energy balance in Crohn disease patients: metabolic implications
      of steroid treatment.
PG  - 118-23
AB  - Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the nutritional deficiencies
      seen in Crohn disease patients, including inadequate food intake, decreased
      assimilation and increased loss of nutrients, and increased energy expenditure.
      To assess the effect of steroid therapy on body composition, energy expenditure, 
      and fuel selection in Crohn disease, we compared 12 patients (6 men and 6 women) 
      with biopsy-proven ileal Crohn disease with 11 healthy volunteers (6 men and 5
      women). Five patients [Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) = 98.4 +/- 3.78]
      took no medication and seven patients (CDAI = 283.9 +/- 22.5) were administered
      29 +/- 18 mg prednisone/d. Body composition was evaluated by isotopic dilution
      and bioelectrical impedance analysis, and 24-h energy expenditure and basal
      metabolic rate were measured in a respiratory chamber. Fat-free mass was not
      significantly different among groups, whereas fat mass was lower in patients than
      in control subjects. Energy intake was higher in treated patients than in both
      untreated patients (P = 0.004) and control subjects (P = 0.005). Fecal losses
      were not significantly different between untreated patients and control subjects,
      but were higher (and proportional to the CDAI) in treated patients than in
      control subjects (P = 0.001). Metabolizable energy was not significantly
      different among groups, whereas energy balance was significantly higher in
      treated patients than in both control subjects (P = 0.0057) and untreated
      patients (P = 0.018). Nitrogen balance was mildly negative in treated patients
      compared with both control subjects and untreated patients, but not significantly
      so. In conclusion, prednisone treatment in Crohn disease patients stimulates food
      intake, promoting an overall positive energy balance despite large fecal nutrient
      losses.

TI  - [Enteral nutrition and total parenteral nutrition in Crohn's disease; factors
      influencing induction of remission].
PG  - 813-25
AB  - The aim of this study was to clarify factors influencing the induction of
      remission and to compare the short term remission rate of EN with that of TPN.
      From 1985 to 1992, 87 active patients treated for more than 4 weeks with EN and
      71 active patients treated with TPN were analysed. Excluding the case with severe
      complications (abdominal abscess, external fistula, sub-ileus), 132 patients were
      divided to two groups (patients with remission and non-remission) based on
      clinical response to the treatment. Remission was defined as Crohn's disease
      activity index (CDAI) < 150 and ESR < 20 mm/hr after 4 weeks of treatment.
      Clinical characteristics and radiographic findings were compared between the two 
      groups. Furthermore, a multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to
      clarify the relative importance of various clinical or radiographic factors
      associated with remission. Remission rate at four weeks with EN was 77% and that 
      with TPN was 62%. By a multiple logistic regression analysis using 15 factors,
      which were significant by a single variable analysis, four factors (times of
      previous nutritional treatment, IOIBD, WBC, polyposis score of the colon) in EN
      cases and three factors (ESR, platelets, extent of Crohn's disease) in TPN cases 
      were selected as independent prognostic factors after adjusting for the effect of
      other factors. Moreover, mode of therapy was not selected as a valuable factor.
      From the above mentioned results, it was concluded that EN and TPN were
      equivalent in the efficacy of short-term therapy and patients having had several 
      previous nutritional therapy, high IOIBD score, high WBC count, severe
      cobblestoning of the colon were tended to be resistant to EN therapy and high ESR
      value, high platelet count, broader extent of Crohn's disease were tended to be
      resistant to TPN therapy. Both clinical and radiographic features are important
      prognostic factors in predicting response to nutritional therapy.

TI  - Diseases of the lips.
PG  - 328-36
AB  - The vermilion of the lips was conceptualized by Jean Darier as the semi-mucosa.
      The anatomy of the lips is transitional from skin to mucous membrane. This
      article emphasizes inflammatory diseases of the lips known as cheilitis. Angular 
      cheilitis is a reactive process with several possible causes, including
      infections, mechanical, nutritional deficiency, and various dermatoses. Contact
      cheilitis may be caused by a primary irritant or a delayed hypersensitivity
      allergic reaction to contactants. Plasma cell cheilitis is a reactive
      periorificial mucositis. Exfoliative cheilitis is also a reactive process,
      probably secondary to factitious activity of the patient. Cheilitis glandularis
      is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the labial salivary glands and their ducts.
      There are three forms: simple, superficial suppurative, and deep suppurative. A
      premalignant potential is present in cheilitis glandularis. Cheilitis
      granulomatosa is one manifestation of orofacial granulomatosis. The granulomatous
      conditions of Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome, sarcoidosis, and Crohn's disease may
      be associated with cheilitis granulomatosa or it may stand alone as Miescher's
      cheilitis. Actinic cheilitis is another premalignant form of cheilitis that is
      amenable to a variety of therapeutic modalities.

TI  - Wernicke encephalopathy and beriberi during total parenteral nutrition
      attributable to multivitamin infusion shortage.
PG  - E10
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Wernicke encephalopathy (WE) is an acute neurologic disorder
      characterized by a triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and mental confusion. WE is 
      attributable to thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. Beriberi is the systemic
      counterpart of thiamine deficiency and often manifests in cardiovascular
      collapse. WE is usually associated with alcoholism and malnutrition. It has also 
      been seen in people with gastrointestinal diseases with malabsorption. Patients
      who have received total parenteral nutrition (TPN) without proper replacement of 
      thiamine have also developed WE. Since November 1996, there has been a shortage
      of multivitamin infusion (MVI). Many patients who were on chronic TPN with MVI
      ceased to receive the MVI and were converted to an oral form of the multivitamin.
      As a result, there have been several reports of children and adults on TPN who
      have developed WE as a result of thiamine deficiency. With this case report, we
      bring to attention the association of the MVI shortage and WE. Early diagnosis of
      WE is important, because if it is treated with thiamine in the acute stages, the 
      neurologic and cardiovascular abnormalities can be reversed. CASE REPORT: We
      report a 20-year-old female patient with Crohn's disease who developed WE as a
      result of thiamine deficiency. She had Crohn's disease since age 9 years and was 
      on chronic TPN. Two months before admission, MVI was discontinued in the TPN
      because of the shortage of its supply. An oral multivitamin tablet was
      substituted instead. She was admitted to the hospital for persistent vomiting. In
      the hospital, she continued to receive TPN without MVI, but continued taking an
      oral multivitamin preparation. Two weeks after admission, she developed signs of 
      WE including diplopia, ophthalmoplegia, nystagmus, and memory disturbance. She
      also developed hypotension that was thought to be caused by beriberi. She was
      treated with 50 mg of intravenous thiamine. Within hours of the intravenous
      thiamine, her hypotension resolved. The day after the infusion, she no longer
      complained of diplopia, and her ophthalmoplegia had improved dramatically.
      Magnetic resonance imaging showed several areas of abnormally high signal on
      T2-weighted images in the brainstem, thalamus, and mamillary bodies. The
      topographic distribution of these changes was typical of WE. After 2 months, her 
      mental status and neurologic status had recovered completely. CONCLUSION: WE and 
      thiamine deficiency should be considered in all patients with malabsorption,
      malnutrition, and malignancies. WE from thiamine deficiency can occur as a result
      of cessation of MVI in the TPN infusion. Even if an oral multivitamin preparation
      is given instead of MVI, patients with malabsorption may not absorb thiamine
      adequately. Prompt diagnosis of WE is important because it is potentially fatal
      and readily treatable with thiamine supplementation. Early recognition of WE may 
      be more difficult in children, because the classic triad of symptoms may not
      develop fully. Magnetic resonance imaging may be useful in these cases to confirm
      the diagnosis of WE. Because the shortage of MVI is expected to be a long-term,
      there are likely to be more cases of WE in the pediatric population of
      TPN-dependent children. Because there is no shortage of intravenous thiamine, it 
      should be administered with TPN even if MVI is not available.

PG  - 141-8
AB  - A cytogenetic study was performed using Crohn's disease patients to determine
      whether the presence of chromosome instability is related to Crohn's disease, a
      chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Sister chromatid exchange (SCE) frequencies
      in peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures from 22 Crohn's disease patients and an
      equal number of healthy controls matched for sex and age were analyzed. The mean 
      of SCE frequency in Crohn's disease patients was 11.64 +/- 0.42 (SEM) per cell,
      which was significantly higher than the value of 8.38 +/- 0.22 per cell in the
      matched controls (p < 0.0001). The Crohn's disease patients showed significantly 
      increased high frequency cells (HFC) as compared to those among the matched
      controls. There was a significant correlation between HFC frequencies of the
      Crohn's disease patients and the severity of their disease as determined by the
      number of relapses per year and the degree of chronic activity after adjusting
      for the smoking status (r = 0.54, p = 0.011). In both smokers and non-smokers,
      the mean SCE and HFC frequencies of the patients were significantly higher than
      those of the controls. These results suggest that Crohn's disease is a condition 
      with increased chromosome instability characterized by a high level of SCE
      frequencies which are associated with the inflammatory condition itself.

TI  - Gallbladder motility and cholecystokinin secretion during continuous enteral
      nutrition.
PG  - 2274-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: During total parenteral nutrition, gallbladder motility is impaired, 
      resulting in sludge and stone formation. Little is known about gallbladder
      motility during prolonged enteral nutrition. METHODS: We studied gallbladder
      motility during continuous enteral nutrition (CEN) in nine hospitalized patients 
      with active inflammatory bowel disease. The patients received a polymeric diet
      (2000 kcal/24 h) by CEN through a nasogastric tube for a prolonged period.
      Gallbladder volumes were obtained daily by ultrasonography, starting from day 0
      (before CEN) and on 7 consecutive days during CEN. At days 0, 1, 4, and 7, the
      gallbladder response to i.v. cholecystokinin (CCK-33; 0.5 Ivy Dog unit/kg/h) was 
      studied. Plasma CCK levels were determined at regular intervals by
      radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed on day 0
      between patients and a group of nine healthy control subjects in fasting
      gallbladder volumes (19.4 +/- 2.3 and 19.6 +/- 2.4 cm3, respectively) and
      gallbladder contraction during CCK infusion (56 +/- 14% and 69 +/- 7%,
      respectively). During CEN, from day 1 to day 7, mean gallbladder volume remained 
      significantly (p < 0.05) reduced compared with fasting gallbladder volume, and
      mean plasma CCK levels remained significantly (p < 0.05) increased compared with 
      fasting levels. Although gallbladder volume was significantly reduced during CEN,
      the gallbladder contractile response to CCK was not affected; at days 1, 4, and
      7, gallbladder contraction was 36-57%. CONCLUSIONS: During CEN, 1) gallbladder
      volume is significantly reduced and plasma CCK levels are significantly
      increased, 2) these effects are sustained over time (7 days), and 3) the
      gallbladder remains responsive to exogenous CCK. These results indicate that
      gallbladder contractility and gallbladder responsiveness to CCK are preserved
      during prolonged CEN in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Warfarin resistance associated with intravenous lipid administration: discussion 
      of propofol and review of the literature.
PG  - 1331-7
AB  - Intravenous lipids are often required for parenteral nutritional (PN) support in 
      critically ill patients and are administered with continuous sedation if patients
      are receiving propofol, which contains soybean oil 10% as an emulsified
      preparation. High-dose propofol infusion was associated with reversal of enteral 
      and intravenous warfarin anticoagulation in a 39-year-old woman with severe
      Crohn's disease. Despite increasing the daily dose of warfarin to 30 mg,
      anticoagulation was not achieved until propofol was discontinued. Reversal of
      anticoagulation recurred when PN support was supplemented with Liposyn II 20%.
      Lipid emulsions may interfere pharmacodynamically with warfarin activity by
      enhancing the production of clotting factors, facilitating platelet aggregation, 
      or supplying vitamin K. They also may facilitate warfarin binding to albumin.
      Until further information regarding the mechanism of interference is elucidated, 
      heparin therapy should be considered for initial anticoagulation in patients with
      intestinal absorptive deficiencies who receive high-dose lipid emulsions and
      require reliable anticoagulation. If warfarin is given, the international
      normalized ratio should be monitored daily to ensure adequate anticoagulation.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease: a study of the association between anxiety and
      depression, physical morbidity, and nutritional status.
PG  - 1013-21
AB  - BACKGROUND: The etiology of inflammatory bowel disease is unclear, and the role
      played by anxiety and depression is highly controversial. Anxiety and depression 
      in patients with inflammatory bowel disease could be secondary to disabling
      symptoms, but the interaction between physical morbidity and psychologic illness 
      in these subjects has not been sufficiently investigated. Patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease are nevertheless frequently undernourished, but there 
      are no studies on the association between anxiety and depression and
      malnutrition. This study was designed to characterize anxiety and depression in
      subjects affected by inflammatory bowel disease and to establish the influence of
      physical morbidity and/or nutritional status on psychologic disorders. METHODS:
      Seventy-nine consecutive patients, 43 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 36 with
      ulcerative colitis (UC), were enrolled in the study. An index of the disease
      activity and physical morbidity was obtained by the simplified Crohn's Disease
      Activity Index and Truelove-Witts criteria and using the Clinical Rating Scale.
      Thirty-six healthy volunteers were studied as controls. All the subjects were
      given the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) test and the Zung self-rating 
      Depression Scale. RESULTS: The percentage of subjects with state anxiety was
      significantly higher in the CD (P < 0.001) and UC (P < 0.001) groups than in
      control subjects. There was no significant difference in trait anxiety among
      groups. The percentage of subjects with depression was significantly higher in
      the CD (P < 0.05) and UC (P < 0.05) groups than in control subjects. State
      anxiety and depression were significantly associated with physical morbidity and 
      correlated with malnutrition in CD and UC patients. CONCLUSION: Anxiety and
      depression in patients with inflammatory bowel disease could be reactive to the
      disabling symptoms and to malnutrition. As measured with the STAI, personality
      trait of anxiety does not seem to play an important role in inflammatory bowel
      disease.

TI  - An update on diseases of the pancreas in children.
PG  - 494-7
AB  - The aim of this review is to describe recent developments in the field of
      pancreatic disorders in children. First, recent developments in the genetic
      research of hereditary pancreatitis are discussed. Subsequently, several issues
      of acute pancreatitis are presented. These include a description of the potential
      hazardous morbidity and mortality of this disorder in children. In addition,
      various novel etiologies that have been described lately in the medical
      literature are illustrated. Next, this paper discusses two examples of pancreatic
      disorders associated with systemic manifestations, i.e., ganglioneuromatosis and 
      diabetes mellitus. Finally, a few rare genetic syndromes with pancreatic
      involvement are touched upon, an association that is not very well recognized.
      Cystic fibrosis is not covered.

TI  - Assessment and management of ulcerative colitis in children.
PG  - 858-63
AB  - The incidence of ulcerative colitis in school-age children in most parts of
      Europe has been steady at 1.5-2.0 per 100,000 children per year for the last
      20-30 years. In comparison to adults, abdominal pain is a relatively frequent
      presenting symptom in children in addition to rectal bleeding, bloody diarrhoea
      or diarrhoea. Distribution of disease in children is generally more extensive
      (ratio rectal:left sided:extensive 25:30:45). There are remarkably few clinical
      trials of therapy in children and reasons for this are discussed. Subjective
      indices of disease severity and activity are unreliable in children. Objective
      measures such as endoscopy are of value to define the extent of ulceration and
      histopathological features; a test of gut protein loss using whole gut lavage
      gives an objective index of disease activity. Principles of medical management in
      children are generally the same as in adults with the additional need for
      scrupulous attention to nutrition and growth, and psychological factors.
      Reassuring results of a review of the health status of young adults who had
      developed ulcerative colitis in childhood are presented. Twenty-four of 27
      considered themselves fully fit although nine of the patients had a permanent
      ileostomy.

TI  - Crohn's disease associated with renal amyloidosis successfully treated with an
      elemental diet.
PG  - 663-7
AB  - We report a case of Crohn's disease associated with nephrotic syndrome due to
      renal amyloidosis in a 21-year-old man in whom remission of both Crohn's disease 
      and the nephrotic syndrome has been maintained with an elemental diet. The
      patient developed toxic megacolon and nephrotic syndrome due to renal
      amyloidosis. Intensive intravenous prednisolone therapy with total parenteral
      nutrition was dramatically effective in treating the toxic megacolon and inducing
      remission in Crohn's disease and afterward, remission of the nephrotic syndrome. 
      Remission of both conditions has been maintained for more than 2 years with the
      elemental diet. To our knowledge, this is the first confirmed case of Crohn's
      disease complicated with renal amyloidosis in which only slight proteinuria
      (below 0.3 g/day) was shown with an elemental diet used for a long period.

PG  - 497-500
AB  - Episodic periorbital swelling due to presumed orbital inflammation and myositis
      caused intermittent apparent proptosis and was the presenting symptom of
      ileocecal Crohn's disease (CD) in a teenage female with a family history of
      autoimmune disorders and CD. Orbital myositis, a very rare extraintestinal
      manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), likely represents a process of
      impaired immunoregulation related to the underlying intestinal inflammation. This
      rare manifestation of IBD simulates the more commonly encountered thyroid
      orbitopathy (ophthalmopathy), but IBD should be considered if all thyroid tests
      are negative. It is important to recognize that orbital myositis may be an
      extraintestinal manifestation of Crohn's disease so that the diagnosis can be
      made and appropriate therapy commenced.

TI  - Impact of surgery on quality of life in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1897-900
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) status is an important
      component in assessing the impact of disease and its treatments in patients with 
      chronic disorders. We recently validated a HRQOL questionnaire in French patients
      with inflammatory bowel disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate
      prospectively the impact of surgery on HRQOL in patients operated on for Crohn's 
      disease (CD). METHODS: Twenty-six patients (14 women, 12 men; median age 28.5 yr)
      undergoing an elective ileocolonic resection for CD were studied. The HRQOL
      questionnaire comprised a general questionnaire of 36 items (Medical Outcomes
      Study-Short Form 36), to which was added a sleep module, and a specific
      questionnaire of 28 items (Rating Form of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patient
      Concerns), to which were added three independent items because of their
      pertinence in the French population. HRQOL was assessed immediately
      preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively. RESULTS: HRQOL was improved
      postoperatively compared with the immediate preoperative status in almost all
      scales. Patient concerns and worries decreased after surgery. However, ranking
      was unchanged for the five most intense concerns: having an ostomy bag, having
      surgery, energy level, uncertainty of the disease, and pain or suffering.
      CONCLUSIONS: HRQOL is greatly improved after surgery for CD, and this reassuring 
      message might be delivered to our patients. In addition, the questionnaire showed
      the ability to detect clinical changes over time. This attests to its potential
      use in research.

TI  - Enteral nutrition for Crohn's disease in Japan.
PG  - S48-53
AB  - UNLABELLED: Indication for and an evaluation of enteral nutrition in Crohn's
      disease differ between Japan and western countries. PURPOSE: Japanese results are
      reported and differences are discussed. RESULTS: Enteral nutrition with an
      elemental diet is first-line therapy for active Crohn's disease in Japan. The
      remission induction rate of elemental diet therapy is approximately 80 percent,
      which is superior to steroids. Furthermore, elemental diet therapy induces
      radiographic and endoscopic remission. On the other hand, meta-analysis from
      randomized, controlled trials showed steroids to be more effective than enteral
      nutrition in western countries. The differences are considered to be the result
      of such differences as therapeutic duration of enteral nutrition, the composition
      of enteral diets used, criteria for remission, the quality of life score of a
      long-term fast with a nasogastric tube, medical care, and health insurance
      system. The main mechanism of the therapeutic effect of elemental diet is
      speculated to be attributable to removal of food antigens and decreases of
      secretion and motility (bowel rest) by very low fat. To prevent relapse and
      rehospitalization, home enteral nutrition is now used widely in Japan. The
      therapeutic effect is observed in patients with ileal involvement, and more than 
      1,200 kcal/day is more effective than a lower amount. CONCLUSION: Most Japanese
      studies were open-labeled, uncontrolled trials. We should conduct randomized,
      controlled trials comparing enteral nutrition with steroids during the active
      stage of Crohn's disease and home enteral nutrition with drugs in maintaining
      remission and investigate the therapeutic effect, quality of life, and costs.

TI  - Skin content of 7-dehydrocholesterol in patients with malabsorption.
PG  - 771-3
AB  - The mechanism for the development of vitamin D deficiency in patients with
      malabsorption remains unclear. We wished to examine the hypothesis that one
      factor was a reduced skin content of 7-dehydrocholesterol, the precursor for the 
      formation of vitamin D in the presence of ultraviolet radiation. We measured
      7-dehydrocholesterol in skin samples from 9 patients who had previously had
      vitamin D deficiency due to malabsorption (6 with Crohn's disease, 2 with primary
      biliary cirrhosis, and 1 with idiopathic pseudo-obstruction). We found no
      evidence of reduced levels of 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin in these patients.
      Lack of 7-dehydrocholesterol does not contribute to vitamin D deficiency in
      malabsorption.

TI  - [Nutrition in the etiopathogenesis of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases].
PG  - 637-49
AB  - It is currently held that the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      involves a complex interaction of host responses, some immunologic and
      genetically determined, and external influences including microbial and dietary
      factors. Nutritional surveys and studies testing stepwise exclusion dietary
      compounds have suggested that dietary factors might be linked to the occurrence
      of IBD. Food allergy was suggested early as a possible trigger for the
      inflammatory response; however, no firm evidence has been gathered over the years
      to substantiate this possibility. The possibility that patients with Crohn's
      disease may have an unusual premorbid pattern of dietary intake has also been
      examined since the early seventies. Several groups of investigators report a high
      intake of refined sugars (i.e. sucrose), recycled cooking oil, a more frequent
      consumption of fast foods in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis
      respectively. However, a critical comparison of incidence and prevalence studies 
      published from 1976 until 1994 clearly showed no pre-existing nutritional
      abnormality that has been identified consistently in patients who develop
      inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - A randomized controlled study comparing elemental diet and steroid treatment in
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 735-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: Elemental diet is considered an effective primary treatment for
      active Crohn's disease, but it is usually given by a feeding tube. METHODS:
      Twenty-two patients (12 males, median age 30 years, range 18-60) with moderately 
      active Crohn's disease were enrolled in a randomized study in which the efficacy 
      of an elemental diet administered orally was compared to high-dose
      corticosteroids in achieving clinical and laboratory remission. Ten patients were
      treated by oral elemental diet (Peptamen, Clintec, USA) and 10 received
      corticosteroids. Both treatment regimens lasted 2 weeks. The two groups did not
      differ with respect to age, sex, body weight, location of disease, treatment or
      disease activity prior to the study. In all patients studied, simple Crohn's
      disease activity index, nutritional status (expressed as body mass index),
      percentage of ideal body weight, fat mass, fat free mass, erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate, interleukin-6, intestinal permeability (expressed as
      permeability index), prealbumin, retinol binding protein and multiskin test were 
      evaluated before and after treatment. RESULTS: After 2 weeks of treatment, there 
      were significant improvements in simple Crohn's disease activity index,
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate, permeability index, body mass index, prealbumin, 
      retinol binding protein and multiskin test in the elemental diet group. There
      were significant improvements in simple Crohn's disease activity index and fat
      free mass in the corticosteroid group. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that, in
      the short term, an oral elemental diet is at least as effective as steroids in
      inducing remission of mild-moderately active Crohn's disease, but it may be more 
      effective in improving the nutritional status of these patients, probably through
      a more rapid restoration of normal intestinal permeability.

TI  - Energy expenditure and body composition in children with Crohn's disease: effect 
      of enteral nutrition and treatment with prednisolone.
PG  - 203-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malnutrition and growth retardation are common complications of
      Crohn's disease in children. The contribution of resting energy expenditure (REE)
      to malnutrition is unclear. AIMS: To characterise the REE and body composition in
      children with Crohn's disease and compare them with normal controls and patients 
      with anorexia nervosa; to compare the effects of prednisolone and enteral
      nutrition on energy expenditure and body composition. SUBJECTS: Twenty four
      children with Crohn's disease, 19 malnourished females with anorexia nervosa, and
      22 healthy control subjects were studied. METHODS: In children with Crohn's
      disease measurements were done when the disease was acute and repeated at one and
      three months after treatment with either prednisolone or enteral nutrition.
      Resting energy expenditure was measured by indirect calorimetry and body
      composition by anthropometry, bioelectrical impedance analysis, total body
      potassium, H218O, and bromide space studies. RESULTS: Body weight and ideal body 
      weight were significantly lower in patients with Crohn's disease than in healthy 
      controls. Lean tissue was depleted and there was an increase in extracellular
      water. Per unit of lean body mass, there was no difference between REE in
      patients with Crohn's disease and controls, whereas patients with anorexia
      nervosa had significantly reduced REE. With enteral nutrition all body
      compartments and REE increased significantly (p < 0.001). In a subgroup of
      age-matched men there was a significant increase in height after three months of 
      enteral nutrition compared with prednisolone (p < 0.01). Those treated with
      steroids did not show a significant change in height but did show an increase in 
      all body compartments. However, intracellular water as well as lean body mass
      accretion were significantly higher in the enteral nutrition group than in the
      prednisolone group. CONCLUSIONS: Despite being malnourished, children with
      Crohn's disease fail to adapt their REE per unit of lean body mass. This might be
      a factor contributing to their malnutrition. Lean tissue accretion is higher in
      patients treated with enteral nutrition than in those treated with prednisolone.

TI  - [New therapeutic possibilities in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases].
PG  - 1071-4
AB  - New therapeutic measures in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are either based on
      actual data on disease pathogenesis or on new pharmaceutic preparations of known 
      drugs. An overshooting immune response with T cell activation in the local gut
      associated immune system seems to be central in the etiopathogenesis of IBD.
      Modulation of the antigenic load in the gut lumen by parenteral or enteral
      nutrition or antibiotic treatment can alter disease activity. Immunosuppressive
      drugs are able to decrease the overshooting immune response. Azathioprin has its 
      clear value in chronic active steroid dependent disease courses of Crohn's
      disease. According to recent studies, Methotrexate seems to be active as well,
      however, more studies are necessary. Several studies were not able to prove that 
      Cyclosporine is of value in the treatment of Crohn's disease. Newer preparations 
      of aminosalicylates have shown effectiveness in both active disease and
      prolongation of remission in Crohn's disease in high doses. Local release
      formulations of steroids with high first-pass-effect as Budesonide will have
      their indication in subgroups of IBD patients. However, systemic steroid
      application is still the gold standard in active disease.

TI  - Cyclic neutropenia in Crohn's ileocolitis: efficacy of granulocyte
      colony-stimulating factor.
PG  - 253-6
AB  - A 40-year-old patient with long-standing Crohn's ileocolitis in remission
      experienced cyclic neutropenia with a periodicity of 14 days. He was not
      receiving immunosuppressive or myelosuppressive therapy. The patient had
      Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia resulting from central catheter infection, which
      was refractory to antibiotic therapy during the period of severe neutropenia.
      When granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was administered, the cyclic
      neutropenia rapidly disappeared, the neutrophil and leukocyte counts normalized, 
      and the sepsis resolved. When G-CSF therapy was discontinued, the leukocyte and
      absolute neutrophil counts again declined. With reinstitution of therapy, the
      leukocyte and absolute neutrophil counts recovered and normalized. Crohn's
      ileocolitis remained in remission during G-CSF therapy. This report confirms and 
      extends one previous report of cyclic neutropenia associated with Crohn's disease
      and demonstrates in one patient the efficacy and safety of G-CSF on the
      hematologic, bacteriologic, and clinical manifestations of cyclic neutropenia
      associated with Crohn's disease.

TI  - Pre-illness dietary factors in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 754-60
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of environmental factors has been demonstrated in the
      pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Nutrition may be one of them.
      AIM: To investigate the pre-illness diet in patients with recent IBD in
      comparison with matched population and clinic controls. METHODS: Quantified
      dietary histories were obtained from 87 patients with recent IBD (54 ulcerative
      colitis (UC) and 33 Crohn's disease (CD)) and 144 controls. Odds ratios (OR) for 
      IBD were derived for intake levels of various foods. RESULTS: A high sucrose
      consumption was associated with an increased risk for IBD (OR 2.85 (p = 0.03)
      against population controls and 5.3 (p = 0.00) against clinic controls). Lactose 
      consumption showed no effect while fructose intake was negatively associated with
      risk for IBD (NS). Similar trends were noted in UC and CD. A high fat intake was 
      associated with an increased risk for UC; this was particularly marked for animal
      fat (OR 4.09, p = 0.02) and cholesterol (OR 4.57, p = 0.02). A high intake of
      fluids (p = 0.04), magnesium (p = 0.04), vitamin C, and fruits (NS) was
      negatively associated with the risk for IBD, while a positive association was
      found for retinol (p = 0.01). Most of the findings were similar in UC and CD
      except for potassium and vegetable consumption which showed a negative
      association only with risk for CD. CONCLUSIONS: An association was found between 
      pre-illness diet and subsequent development of UC and CD. The effect of dietary
      components may be primary or modulatory.

TI  - The safety of gastrostomy in patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 985-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety of gastrostomy tube placement in patients with 
      Crohn's disease. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 25 patients
      with Crohn's disease who underwent surgical or endoscopic gastrostomy tube
      placement. Additional follow-up information was obtained by contacting the
      patients by telephone. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients with Crohn's disease
      underwent either surgical or percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement for
      prolonged enteral nutrition or gastric decompression after abdominal surgery.
      Gastrostomies were placed without difficulty in all cases. No major complications
      occurred after the procedures. Minor complications occurred in five patients,
      including one case of local wound infection, one case of persistent pain at the
      gastrostomy site, and three cases of peristomal leakage. These minor
      complications occurred in 22% of those who underwent percutaneous gastrostomy
      tube placement and 16% of those who underwent surgical gastrostomy. There was a
      higher incidence of minor complications in those who underwent gastrostomy for
      gastrointestinal decompression than in those who underwent the procedure for
      nutritional supplementation (14% versus 3.5%). A prior history of fistula
      formation did not predispose to complications related to gastrostomy placement.
      After gastrostomy tube removal, rapid closure of the site occurred in 96%. No
      cases of gastrocutaneous fistula formation occurred during follow-up, which
      ranged from 45 days to 8.7 yr (mean = 2.6 yr). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that
      gastrostomy placement is safe in patients with Crohn's disease and does not
      result in an increased incidence of peristomal disease or formation of prolonged 
      gastrocutaneous fistulas after gastrostomy tube removal.

TI  - Polyunsaturated fat in the diet may improve intestinal function in patients with 
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 262-70
AB  - To investigate the effect of increasing dietary polyunsaturated fat intake on fat
      absorption in Crohn's patients, normal subjects and subjects with inactive
      Crohn's disease consumed a high polyunsaturated to saturated fat ratio diet.
      Subjects participated in breath tests before and after six months of a high
      polyunsaturated to saturated (P/S) fat ratio diet to measure their response to
      [1-13C] 10:0 and [1-13C] 16:0 ingested with a test meal. Whole body
      absorption-oxidation of C10:0 was not affected by the diet treatment. Before diet
      treatment, whole body absorption-oxidation of C16:0 in Crohn's patients was 80%
      of that observed for control subjects. After consuming a high polyunsaturated to 
      saturated fatty acid ratio diet, subjects increased oxidation of C16:0 by 85%
      compared to before the diet treatment period. It is concluded that (1) absorption
      of labelled C16:0 from a test meal is reduced in Crohn's patients, and (2)
      consumption of a high polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratio diet improves
      the utilization of dietary C16:0 by Crohn's patients.

TI  - Vertebral compression fractures in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1710-3
AB  - Osteoporosis is known to be a significant complication of Crohn's disease in
      adult patients. The association of osteoporosis and the development of vertebral 
      compression fractures is well delineated. This case report describes 5 pediatric 
      patients with Crohn's disease in whom vertebral compression fractures associated 
      with a marked reduction in bone density developed. As in adults, the association 
      of osteoporosis and Crohn's disease in pediatric patients is multifactorial,
      including corticosteroid use, calcium and vitamin D homeostasis, malnutrition,
      alteration in sex hormones, and site of disease. At the time of diagnosis of the 
      vertebral fractures, the patients' ages ranged from 10.6 to 16.8 years, they had 
      persistent and severe back pain, and 3 of 5 patients had a decrease in height.
      They were taking 13.7-41.6 mg/day of corticosteroid, and all 5 patients had
      terminal ileal involvement. Bone mineral density measured by dual-energy x-ray
      absorptiometry was well below 2SD from the mean in all patients (z-score, -2.31
      to -5.11). Because of the high morbidity and mortality associated with fractures 
      that result from low bone mineral density, medical care of all pediatric patients
      with Crohn's disease should include an evaluation of bone mineral density.

AB  - No medical on surgical treatment exists that is ideal for the patient afflicted
      Crohn's disease. During the chronic course of disease various complications or
      significant side effect of medications will develop. At this point, the patient
      is offered an operation. Indication for surgery rarely absolute in Crohn's
      disease with the exception of life threatening emergencies such as free
      perforation or massive hemorrhage. Common indications are bowel obstruction due
      to stenosis, fistula in various sites, abscess and perianal complications. It is 
      well known that future likelihood of postoperative "recurrence" of the disease,
      and to learn various operative procedures described in this article. Therefore
      surgeon should be alert to understand the pathophysiology of the disease and to
      learn various operative procedures described in this article. It is important to 
      determine proper indication and to choose best timing for operation and select
      the appropriate operative procedures.

AB  - Under the current conditions that etiologies of Crohn's Disease (CD) are not
      detected and then no radical therapy existed, it is necessary that the CD
      patients can be medically managed by not only medical doctors but also other
      co-medical staffs such as nurses, dietitians, social workers and ET (Enterostomal
      Therapist) nurses for their cure & care therapy. There are some different
      therapeutic steps; 1) Nutritional Therapy, 2) Drug Therapy, 3) Surgical Therapy
      and 4) Psychological (Mental) Support. In Japan, Nutritional Therapy headed by
      Elemental Enteral Nutrition is recommended as for 1st choice standard therapy for
      CD patients, who are mainly very young and are required to have themselves
      acceptable for long-term therapeutic controls. Thus, the medical support team
      shall be considerable enough to each patient's life back ground in order to give 
      them the whole-mentally therapeutic approach.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease and predisposition to osteopenia.
PG  - 325-9
AB  - The prevalence of osteopenia in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is
      unknown. The effect of nutritional state, disease activity, and steroid therapy
      on bone mineral content (BMC) of whole body, lumbar spine, and left femoral neck 
      measured by dual energy x ray absorptiometry in 32 children with IBD was assessed
      by comparison with 58 healthy local school children. Using the control data, a
      predicted BMC was calculated taking into account bone area, age, height, weight, 
      and pubertal stage. The measured BMC in children with IBD was expressed as a
      percentage of this predicted value (% BMC). Mean (SD) % BMC was significantly
      reduced for the whole body and left femoral neck in the children with IBD (97.0
      (4.5)% and 93.1 (12.0)% respectively, p < 0.05). Of the children with IBD, 41%
      had a % BMC less than 1 SD below the mean for the whole body and 47% at the
      femoral neck. Reduction in % BMC was associated with steroid usage but not with
      the magnitude of steroid dose, disease activity, or biochemical markers of bone
      metabolism. In conclusion, osteopenia is relatively common in childhood IBD and
      may be partly related to the previous use of steroids.

AB  - The relationships between non-specific inflammatory bowel disease and nutrition
      is considered. One of the hypotheses holds that environmental factors, especially
      those in dietary intake, can be the initiators of intestinal inflammation. In
      this connection authors examined a group of patients suffering from Crohns
      disease and ulcerative colitis. Results observed in patients with Crohns disease 
      indicate: preferred consumption of flour products, decreased intake of vegetables
      and fruit, lowered tolerance to milk and milk products, increased sugar
      consumption, increased proportion of smokers, no differences in diet regimen
      between nick and healthy subjects. (Tab. 3, Ref. 16.)

AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment with sulphasalazine of patients with mild and moderate
      forms of Crohn's disease may result in side effects in some of them. CASE REPORT:
      An 11-year-old girl with Crohn's disease was given 40 mg/kd/day of sulphasalazine
      after achieving remission with prednisone. She developed urticaria and
      eosionophilia 8 days later, then extended skin edema during a second course of
      sulphasalazine requiring methyl prednisolone therapy. Mesalazine administration
      (25 mg/kg/day), one month later, resulted to watery stools, vomiting, and fever, 
      a side effect observed again after two further mesalazine challenges of one-month
      interval. Eosionophilia was present and the lymphocyte stimulation test with
      mesalazine was positive. Successful desensitization to sulphasalazine could be
      obtained 9 months later permitting further safe administration of this drug up to
      18 months. CONCLUSION: Hypersensitivity to sulphasalazine may be successfully
      overcame by oral desensitization, especially in those patients with low-grade
      activity of Crohn's disease.

TI  - Assessing the quality of life of patients with intestinal failure on home
      parenteral nutrition.
PG  - 218-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: A study was performed to measure the quality of life of patients
      receiving home parenteral nutrition (HPN). Quality of life is an important
      determinant of the effectiveness of health technologies, but it has rarely been
      assessed in patients receiving HPN. AIMS: To measure quality of life and
      highlight any moderating factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Quality of life was
      measured using two validated instruments (SF 36 and EuroQol) in 51 patients with 
      intestinal failure. All patients had benign disease, the commonest being Crohn's 
      disease (n = 35). RESULTS: HPN patient scores were worse for six of eight SF 36
      domains (p < 0.05) compared with standard population scores. Younger patients (< 
      45) had good scores but older patients (> 55 years) scored significantly less.
      Patients addicted to narcotic substances had very low scores. EuroQol utility
      scores confirmed the SF results. Forty one patients reported that they felt too
      ill to work and only five were in full time work or education. CONCLUSIONS: The
      health status profile of our young patients on HPN was good compared with the
      normal population. The poorest scores were in older patients and those dependent 
      on narcotic drugs. This has clinical and economic relevance when considering such
      patients for HPN.

TI  - Experience of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy in children with Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 141-3
AB  - Enternal nutrition is an important mode of treatment for Crohn's disease in
      children. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy has been little used, even through 
      it can facilitate the administration of an unpalatable elemental diet to an
      anorexic, undernourished patients. Its use is reported in 10 children with
      Crohn's disease. The gastrostomy was found to be more acceptable than a
      nasogastric tube and was associated with only minor complications. As a
      consequence of improved delivery of enteral nutrition, in the year after the
      insertion of the gastrostomy there was a reduction in prednisolone dosage in all 
      patients, with six patients being able to stop prednisolone completely. The SD
      score for height also improved significantly. It is suggested that percutaneous
      endoscopic gastrostomy is both useful and safe in the management of Crohn's
      disease in children, particularly when compliance with an elemental diet is
      likely to be poor.

TI  - Serum basic fibroblast growth factor in pediatric Crohn's disease. Implications
      for wound healing.
PG  - 378-86
AB  - Basic fibroblast growth factor is a heparin-binding protein known to stimulate
      angiogenesis and promote wound healing in tissues. Since Crohn's disease is
      characterized in part by submucosal vascular proliferation, we sought to
      determine whether serum basic fibroblast growth factor is elevated in children
      with Crohn's disease and whether serum levels reflect disease activity. Sera were
      obtained from 64 children with Crohn's disease, 44 children with ulcerative
      colitis, 20 children with functional abdominal pain, and 29 from children with
      documented inflammatory disease evaluated in our gastroenterology program.
      Disease activity indices and clinical data were gathered prospectively for the
      inflammatory bowel disease patients. Serum basic fibroblast growth factor levels 
      were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Although the mean basic
      fibroblast growth factor level did not significantly differ between children with
      Crohn's disease and other conditions, there was a strong (r = 0.53, P < 0.001)
      correlation between basic fibroblast growth factor level and disease activity.
      The relationship of basic fibroblast growth factor with disease activity
      persisted even after adjusting for other covariates (including age, sex,
      hematocrit, albumin, and sedimentation rate) in a multivariate linear regression 
      model. There was also a statistically significant, although less strong
      correlation (r = 0.33, P = 0.03) between basic fibroblast growth factor level and
      disease activity in ulcerative colitis. While basic fibroblast growth factor is
      not a specific marker for Crohn's disease, serum levels reflect disease activity.
      Therefore, basic fibroblast growth factor release may be important in mediating
      the angiogenesis and wound healing seen in Crohn's disease.

TI  - Transhiatal oesophagectomy for benign obstructive conditions of the oesophagus.
PG  - 262-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Transhiatal oesophagectomy is an accepted approach for the treatment 
      of carcinoma of the oesophagus. However, experience of this technique in benign
      diseases is limited. METHODS: Transhiatal oesophagectomy was done in 29 patients 
      for benign oesophageal conditions including corrosive stricture (21), achalasia
      of the cardia (four), tuberculosis (one), mediastinal fibrosis (one), Crohn's
      disease (one) and peptic stricture (one). Dysphagia was the predominant symptom
      in all patients; strictures had all previously been dilated repeatedly. The
      stomach was used as an oesophageal substitute in 24 patients; in five with a
      scarred stomach due to damage by a corrosive agent, oesophagocoloplasty was
      performed. Resection and reconstruction were done in one stage in 25 patients;
      four with poor nutritional status had a two-stage procedure. RESULTS: There was
      no perioperative death. Complications encountered were recurrent laryngeal nerve 
      palsy (six patients) which was mostly transient, anastomotic leak (seven) and
      stenosis (eight). Postoperative function of the intrathoracic stomach was
      satisfactory. CONCLUSION: Transhiatal oesophagectomy is a safe and satisfactory
      procedure for benign obstructive conditions of the oesophagus.

TI  - Review article: the dietary management of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 17-31
AB  - Enteral feeding has been shown to be as effective as primary therapy for Crohn's 
      disease, but it requires high patient motivation, may be unpalatable and is
      expensive. However, in adolescents with growth failure and when corticosteroid
      therapy is contra-indicated or has failed, it may become the treatment of choice.
      Furthermore, dietary therapy allows circumvention of the adverse side-effects of 
      repeated courses of steroids. A number of different hypotheses have been proposed
      to explain the effect of enteral feeds but none has reached universal acceptance.
      Prospective trials suggest that the exclusion of whole protein is not necessary. 
      Comparison of feeds with differing composition suggests that a low fat content
      increases efficacy and various explanations have been offered. The reduction of
      colonic bacterial load may also be important. Because symptoms of Crohn's disease
      may be provoked by eating, there is a risk of falsely attributing symptoms to
      specific foodstuffs. However, in many individuals foods can be identified which
      affect disease activity, and their exclusion leads to prolongation of disease
      remission. Dietetic supervision during food testing is important to avoid
      detrimental effects on nutrient and micronutrient intake.

TI  - Crohn's disease associated with pellagra and increased excretion of
      5-hydroxyindolacetic acid.
PG  - 111-3
AB  - A 47-year-old woman with seronegative polyarthritis, diarrhea, and
      photosensitivity dermatitis was found to have Crohn's disease and pellagra. The
      presence of high values of 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid in the urine began the
      exhaustive investigations and finally enterotomy. No mass lesion was found.
      Argyrophilic cells were not increased in areas of inflamed intestinal mucosa or
      the normal mucosa. The disagreement between biochemical and histologic findings
      was attributed to sampling error. Antiinflammatory treatment for Crohn's disease 
      was given and the gastrointestinal and articular symptoms improved, excretion of 
      5-hydroxyindolacetic acid returned to normal and there was no relapse of
      pellagra. Pellagra as a complication of Crohn's disease has been described in 4
      cases; malnutrition and intestinal malabsorption were the proposed mechanisms for
      the niacin deficiency and pellagra of those patients. In the current case, the
      pathogenesis of pellagra may be accounted to wastage of tryptophan by an
      increased pool of intestinal argyrophilic cells, suggested by increased urinary
      excretion of 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid.

TI  - Surgical treatment for duodenal involvement in Crohn's disease: report of a case.
PG  - 858-62
AB  - A 29-year-old woman was hospitalized with a 1-month history of postprandial
      epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting. An upper gastrointestinal tract X-ray
      series showed a marked narrowing of the pyloric region. A histological
      examination of duodenal mucosal biopsy samples showed granulomatous inflammation,
      and thus a diagnosis of intrinsic duodenal Crohn's disease was made. A second
      upper gastrointestinal tract X-ray revealed a persistent gastric outlet
      obstruction. At laparotomy, the duodenal wall was found to be thickened over a
      distance measuring 3.5 cm in length from the pyloric ring. A longitudinal
      incision was made over the entire length, up to 5.5 cm beyond the pyloric ring on
      either side, while Finney-type anastomosis was also performed. A postoperative
      upper gastrointestinal tract X-ray showed an improvement in the gastroduodenal
      passage. Enteral nutrition therapy was provided postoperatively. Omeprazole was
      administered at a dose of 20 mg/day for 2 months. The patient currently remains
      on maintenance therapy with famotidine at 20 mg/day and is clinically doing well.

PG  - 153-5
AB  - We report the case of a young woman with Crohn's disease involving the entire
      digestive tract and with associated lesions of the liver, pancreas and
      gallbladder. This latter lesion led to acute cholecystitis which required
      cholecystectomy. The histo-pathological examination showed granulomas with
      multinucleated giant cells in the lamina propria. This observation illustrates a 
      severe and extended form of Crohn's disease involving the entire digestive tract 
      as well as the liver, the pancreas and the gallbladder.
