AB  - INTRODUCTION: The ESPEN guideline presents a multidisciplinary focus on clinical 
      nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODOLOGY: The guideline is
      based on extensive systematic review of the literature, but relies on expert
      opinion when objective data were lacking or inconclusive. The conclusions and 64 
      recommendations have been subject to full peer review and a Delphi process in
      which uniformly positive responses (agree or strongly agree) were required.
      RESULTS: IBD is increasingly common and potential dietary factors in its
      aetiology are briefly reviewed. Malnutrition is highly prevalent in IBD -
      especially in Crohn's disease. Increased energy and protein requirements are
      observed in some patients. The management of malnutrition in IBD is considered
      within the general context of support for malnourished patients. Treatment of
      iron deficiency (parenterally if necessary) is strongly recommended. Routine
      provision of a special diet in IBD is not however supported. Parenteral nutrition
      is indicated only when enteral nutrition has failed or is impossible. The
      recommended perioperative management of patients with IBD undergoing surgery
      accords with general ESPEN guidance for patients having abdominal surgery.
      Probiotics may be helpful in UC but not Crohn's disease. Primary therapy using
      nutrition to treat IBD is not supported in ulcerative colitis, but is moderately 
      well supported in Crohn's disease, especially in children where the adverse
      consequences of steroid therapy are proportionally greater. However, exclusion
      diets are generally not recommended and there is little evidence to support any
      particular formula feed when nutritional regimens are constructed. CONCLUSIONS:
      Available objective data to guide nutritional support and primary nutritional
      therapy in IBD are presented as 64 recommendations, of which 9 are very strong
      recommendations (grade A), 22 are strong recommendations (grade B) and 12 are
      based only on sparse evidence (grade 0); 21 recommendations are good practice
      points (GPP).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Altered body composition is frequently observed in Crohn's disease
      (CD) patients. AIMS: To investigate the nutritional status, and the effect of
      different therapeutic regimes in adult CD patients. METHODS: Fat free mass (FFM) 
      and BIA-derived phase angle (PhA) were assessed in 45 CD patients, 22 on
      conventional therapy (CT) and 23 on maintenance therapy with infliximab (MT).
      Nutritional status was also assessed in 12 CD patients before and following the
      induction protocol with infliximab. BIA data of CD patients were compared with
      those of 20 healthy asymptomatic volunteers. In CD patients C Reactive Protein
      (CRP) and albuminaemia dosage were obtained. RESULTS: The mean values of PhA and 
      of FFM were significantly lower in CT patients when compared with control group
      and MT patients. Following infliximab treatment FFM increased, although not
      significantly, while mean phase angle value significantly increased from
      4.6+/-0.3 to 6.2+/-0.4 (p<0.05). CRP was significantly lower in MT patients
      compared to that in CT patients. CONCLUSION: CD patients on conventional therapy 
      showed a lower FFM and a lower mean phase angle score compared to those on
      infliximab therapy. Following infliximab treatment the mean phase angle score
      normalized. PhA is a reliable nutritional indicator in IBD patients and could be 
      considered as an additional tool for assessing response to treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic and disabling condition. There is
      no curative medical treatment but current treatments provide increasingly
      sustainable control of the disease and allow patients a better quality of life.
      There is limited evidence supporting CD management in specific clinical
      situations, thus precluding an evidence-based approach. AIMS: To help clinicians 
      in making informed treatment decisions, a group of 59 French gastroenterologists 
      with experience in the management of CD met to develop straightforward and
      practical algorithms based on the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation
      (ECCO) recommendations. METHODS: This experts' opinion was developed following a 
      Nominal Group consensus methodology. Nine clinical situations were identified:
      mildly active CD; uncomplicated moderately active CD, with, and without poor
      prognostic factors; uncomplicated severely active CD; perianal CD with a single
      fistula; perianal CD with complex fistula with or without abscess; complicated CD
      with abscess; intestinal stricture; and post-operative CD. Two working groups
      were formed and proposed algorithms that were then approved by a two-thirds
      majority of the Nominal Group. RESULTS: These algorithms represent the pragmatic 
      consensus of a group of experts in gastroenterology on the modalities of
      therapeutic care in different clinical situations in CD. They are available via a
      web application at: www.algorithmici.com.

      cohort.
PG  - 10653-10662
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i48.10653 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Infantile-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IO-IBD) with the onset of
      disease before 12 mo of age, is a different disease entity from childhood IBD. We
      aimed to describe the clinical features, outcome and role of mutation in
      interleukin-10 (IL-10) and interleukin-10 receptors (IL-10R) in Asian children
      with IO-IBD. METHODS: All cases of IO-IBD, defined as onset of disease before 12 
      mo of age, seen at University Malaya Medical Center, Malaysia were reviewed. We
      performed mutational analysis for IL10 and IL10R genes in patients with
      presenting clinical features of Crohn's disease (CD). RESULTS: Six [13%; CD = 3, 
      ulcerative colitis (UC) = 2, IBD-unclassified (IBD-U) = 1] of the 48 children (CD
      = 25; UC = 23) with IBD have IO-IBD. At final review [median (range) duration of 
      follow-up: 6.5 (3.0-20) years], three patients were in remission without
      immunosuppression [one each for post-colostomy (IBD-U), after standard
      immunosuppression (CD), and after total colectomy (UC)]. Three patients were on
      immunosuppression: one (UC) was in remission while two (both CD) had persistent
      disease. As compared with later-onset disease, IO-IBD were more likely to present
      with bloody diarrhea (100% vs 55%, P = 0.039) but were similar in terms of an
      associated autoimmune liver disease (0% vs 19%, P = 0.31), requiring biologics
      therapy (50% vs 36%, P = 0.40), surgery (50% vs 29%, P = 0.27), or achieving
      remission (50% vs 64%, P = 0.40). No mutations in either IL10 or IL10R in the
      three patients with CD and the only patient with IBD-U were identified.
      CONCLUSION: The clinical features of IO-IBD in this Asian cohort of children who 
      were negative for IL-10 or IL-10R mutations were variable. As compared to
      childhood IBD with onset of disease after 12 mo of age, IO-IBD achieved remission
      at a similar rate.

TI  - Alterations in glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activities in
      plasma and saliva in relation to disease activity in patients with Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 709-715
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory condition with uncertain
      aetiology. Dysfunction of immunoregulatory factors and overproduction of reactive
      oxygen species (ROS) may contribute to the damage of the gastrointestinal tract. 
      Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) are involved in
      protection of cells from the damaging effects of ROS. The aim of the study was to
      assess activity of antioxidative stress enzymes, GPx and SOD, in plasma and
      saliva of patients with active and inactive forms of CD. Forty-seven patients
      with CD were prospectively enrolled in the study. The control group comprised 25 
      healthy volunteers. Patients' demographics, clinical features, localization of
      inflammatory changes, CD history, and treatment were recorded. SOD and GPx were
      assayed in plasma and saliva samples by ELISA method. CD activity index (CDAI)
      scores correlated inversely with SOD in plasma (r = - 0.46; P = 0.0012), but not 
      in saliva. No correlations were observed in respect to GPx activities in both
      plasma and saliva and CDAI. Higher activity of plasma SOD was observed in
      patients with inactive CD in comparison with active CD (P = 0.004). No
      significant differences in SOD and GPx activity both in plasma and saliva were
      found between CD remission group and the control group. We concluded that in
      active CD the antioxidant defence system was diminished and returned to normal
      values in remission. Results of SOD and GPx assays in saliva are not conclusive, 
      suggesting that saliva seems to be not an appropriate material for further
      similar studies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk factors of early surgical intervention in
      Crohn's disease (CD) patients with spontaneous intra-abdominal abscess. METHODS: 
      Clinical data of 94 CD patients with spontaneous intra-abdominal abscess admitted
      to The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University between May 2008 and
      Dec 2015 were analyzed retrospectively. Univariate and multivariate analysis were
      applied to evaluate the early surgery risk of CD patients with spontaneous
      intra-abdominal abscess using logistic regression model. RESULTS: A total of 94
      eligible patients were identified from our registry, including 70 males and 24
      females. The mean age at the diagnosis of CD and at development of abscess was
      28.4 years and 30.4 years old, respectively. The median duration of CD between
      the diagnosis and development of an abscess was 3 years. According to the
      Montreal classification, L3 (ileocolonic) was the most common disease location
      (81.9%) in these patients. Most of the patients(76.6%) developed a single
      abscess, while multiple abscesses were detected in 22 patients(23.4%). Forty-four
      patients(46.8%) underwent surgery within 60 days after hospitalization due to
      spontaneous intra-abdominal abscess complicating CD. Multivariate logistic
      regression analysis revealed that history of abdominal surgery(OR=3.23,
      95%CI:1.12 to 9.31, P=0.030), concomitant intestinal stenosis (OR=3.52,
      95%CI:1.26 to 9.85, P=0.017) and concomitant intestinal fistula (OR=4.31,
      95%CI:1.25 to 14.80, P=0.020) were the independent risk factors of early surgical
      intervention, while enteral nutrition (OR=0.18, 95%CI:0.05 to 0.62, P=0.007) was 
      the independent protective factor. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly half of CD patients with
      spontaneous intra-abdominal abscess will undergo early surgical intervention.
      Patients with history of abdominal surgery, concomitant intestinal stenosis and
      concomitant intestinal fistula have higher risk of early surgical intervention,
      and appropriate application of enteral nutrition may reduce the risk.

      with filgotinib (the FITZROY study): results from a phase 2, double-blind,
      randomised, placebo-controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Filgotinib (GLPG0634, GS-6034) is a once-daily, orally administered, 
      Janus kinase 1 (JAK1)-selective inhibitor. The FITZROY study examined the
      efficacy and safety of filgotinib for the treatment of moderate-to-severe Crohn's
      disease. METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2
      study, which recruited patients from 52 centres in nine European countries. We
      enrolled eligible patients aged 18-75 years with a documented history of ileal,
      colonic, or ileocolonic Crohn's disease for 3 months or more before screening, as
      assessed by colonoscopy and supported by histology, and a Crohn's Disease
      Activity Index (CDAI) score during screening between 220 and 450 inclusive.
      Patients were randomly assigned (3:1) to receive filgotinib 200 mg once a day or 
      placebo for 10 weeks. Patients were stratified according to previous anti-tumour 
      necrosis factor alpha exposure, C-reactive protein concentration at screening
      (</=10 mg/L or >10 mg/L), and oral corticosteroid use at baseline, using an
      interactive web-based response system. The primary endpoint was clinical
      remission, defined as CDAI less than 150 at week 10. After week 10, patients were
      assigned based on responder status to filgotinib 100 mg once a day, filgotinib
      200 mg once a day, or placebo for an observational period lasting a further 10
      weeks. The filgotinib and placebo treatment groups were compared using ANCOVA
      models and logistic regression models containing baseline values and
      randomisation stratification factors as fixed effects. Analyses were done on the 
      intention-to-treat non-responder imputation set. The trial was registered at
      ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02048618. FINDINGS: Between Feb 3, 2014, and July
      10, 2015, we enrolled 174 patients with active Crohn's disease confirmed by
      centrally read endoscopy (130 in the filgotinib 200 mg group and 44 in the
      placebo group). In the intention-to-treat population, 60 (47%) of 128 patients
      treated with filgotinib 200 mg achieved clinical remission at week 10 versus ten 
      (23%) of 44 patients treated with placebo (difference 24 percentage points [95%
      CI 9-39], p=0.0077). In a pooled analysis of all periods of filgotinib and
      placebo exposure over 20 weeks, serious treatment-emergent adverse effects were
      reported in 14 (9%) of 152 patients treated with filgotinib and three (4%) of 67 
      patients treated with placebo. INTERPRETATION: Filgotinib induced clinical
      remission in significantly more patients with active Crohn's disease compared
      with placebo, and had an acceptable safety profile. FUNDING: Galapagos.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Genetic variation in the Laccase (multicopper oxidoreductase)
      domain-containing 1 (LACC1) gene has been shown to affect the risk of Crohn's
      disease, leprosy and, more recently, ulcerative colitis and juvenile idiopathic
      arthritis. LACC1 function appears to promote fatty-acid oxidation, with
      concomitant inflammasome activation, reactive oxygen species production, and
      anti-bacterial responses in macrophages. We sought to contribute to elucidating
      LACC1 biological function by extensive characterization of its expression in
      human tissues and cells, and through preliminary analyses of the regulatory
      mechanisms driving such expression. METHODS: We implemented Western blot,
      quantitative real-time PCR, immunofluorescence microscopy, and flow cytometry
      analyses to investigate fatty acid metabolism-immune nexus (FAMIN; the LACC1
      encoded protein) expression in subcellular compartments, cell lines and relevant 
      human tissues. Gene-set enrichment analyses were performed to initially
      investigate modulatory mechanisms of LACC1 expression. A small-interference RNA
      knockdown in vitro model system was used to study the effect of FAMIN depletion
      on peroxisome function. RESULTS: FAMIN expression was detected in
      macrophage-differentiated THP-1 cells and several human tissues, being highest in
      neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells
      among peripheral blood cells. Subcellular co-localization was exclusively
      confined to peroxisomes, with some additional positivity for organelle
      endomembrane structures. LACC1 co-expression signatures were enriched for genes
      involved in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) signaling
      pathways, and PPAR ligands downregulated FAMIN expression in in vitro model
      systems. CONCLUSION: FAMIN is a peroxisome-associated protein with primary
      role(s) in macrophages and other immune cells, where its metabolic functions may 
      be modulated by PPAR signaling events. However, the precise molecular mechanisms 
      through which FAMIN exerts its biological effects in immune cells remain to be
      elucidated.

TI  - Postoperative Complications after Ileocecal Resection in Crohn's Disease: A
      Prospective Study From the REMIND Group.
PG  - 337-345
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2016.541 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the frequency of and risk factors for early
      (30-day) postoperative complications after ileocecal resection in a
      well-characterized, prospective cohort of Crohn's disease patients. METHODS: The 
      REMIND group performed a nationwide study in 9 French university medical centers.
      Clinical-, biological-, surgical-, and treatment-related data on the 3 months
      before surgery were collected prospectively. Patients operated on between 1
      September 2010 and 30 August 2014 were included. RESULTS: A total of 209 patients
      were included. The indication for ileocecal resection was stricturing disease in 
      109 (52%) cases, penetrating complications in 88 (42%), and medication-refractory
      inflammatory disease in 12 (6%). A two-stage procedure was performed in 33 (16%) 
      patients. There were no postoperative deaths. Forty-three (21%) patients (23% of 
      the patients with a one-stage procedure vs. 9% of those with a two-stage
      procedure, P=0.28) experienced a total of 54 early postoperative complications
      after a median time interval of 5 days (interquartile range, 4-12):
      intra-abdominal septic complications (n=38), extra-intestinal infections (n=10), 
      and hemorrhage (n=6). Eighteen complications (33%) were severe (Dindo-Clavien
      III-IV). Reoperation was necessary in 14 (7%) patients, and secondary stomy was
      performed in 8 (4.5%). In a multivariate analysis, corticosteroid treatment in
      the 4 weeks before surgery was significantly associated with an elevated
      postoperative complication rate (odds ratio (95% confidence interval)=2.69
      (1.15-6.29); P=0.022). Neither preoperative exposure to anti-tumor necrosis
      factor (TNF) agents (n=93, 44%) nor trough serum anti-TNF levels were significant
      risk factors for postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: In this large,
      nationwide, prospective cohort, postoperative complications were observed after
      21% of the ileocecal resections. Corticosteroid treatment in the 4 weeks before
      surgery was significantly associated with an elevated postoperative complication 
      rate. In contrast, preoperative anti-TNF therapy (regardless of the serum level
      or the time interval between last administration and surgery) was not associated 
      with an elevated risk of postoperative complications.

AB  - It is now widely acknowledged that the intestinal bacterial flora together with
      genetic predisposing factors significantly contribute to the immunopathogenesis
      of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as reflected by mucosal immune dysregulation.
      Recently, there has been an increased interest in nutraceutical therapies,
      including probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics. Other dietary interventions with
      low carbohydrate diet, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and glutamine have
      been attempted to downregulate the gut inflammatory response and thereby
      alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms. Enteral nutrition has been widely used as
      induction and maintenance therapies in the management of Crohn's disease (CD). In
      this review, a critical assessment of the results of clinical trial outcomes and 
      meta-analyses was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of dietary and enteral
      interventions for CD.

TI  - Improvements in the Long-Term Outcome of Crohn's Disease Over the Past Two
      Decades and the Relation to Changes in Medical Management: Results from the
      Population-Based IBDSL Cohort.
PG  - 325-336
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2016.524 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Medical treatment options and strategies for Crohn's disease (CD)
      have changed over the past decades. To assess its impact, we studied the
      evolution of the long-term disease outcome in the Dutch Inflammatory Bowel
      Disease South Limburg (IBDSL) cohort. METHODS: In total, 1,162 CD patients were
      included. Three eras were distinguished: 1991-1998 (n=316), 1999-2005 (n=387),
      and 2006-2011 (n=459), and patients were followed until 2014. Medication exposure
      and the rates of hospitalization, surgery, and phenotype progression were
      estimated using Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and compared between eras by
      multivariable Cox regression models. Second, propensity score matching was used
      to assess the relation between medication use and the long-term outcome. RESULTS:
      Over time, the immunomodulator exposure rate increased from 30.6% in the era
      1991-1998 to 70.8% in the era 2006-2011 at 5 years. Similar, biological exposure 
      increased from 3.1% (era 1991-1998) to 41.2% (era 2006-2011). In parallel, the
      hospitalization rate attenuated from 65.9% to 44.2% and the surgery rate from
      42.9% to 17.4% at 5 years, respectively (both P<0.01). Progression to a
      complicated phenotype has not changed over time (21.2% in the era 1991-1998 vs.
      21.3% in the era 2006-2011, P=0.93). Immunomodulator users had a similar risk of 
      hospitalization, surgery, or phenotype progression as propensity score-matched
      nonusers (P>0.05 for all analyses). Similar results were found for biological
      users (P>0.05 for all analyses). CONCLUSIONS: Between 1991 and 2014, the
      hospitalization and surgery rates decreased, whereas progression to complicated
      disease is still common in CD. These improvements were not significantly related 
      to the use of immunomodulators and biologicals.

TI  - Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's Disease Are Associated with Decreased Serum
      Selenium Concentrations and Increased Cardiovascular Risk.
LID - E780 [pii]
AB  - The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and associated oxidative stress
      is increasing. The antioxidant mineral selenium (Se) was measured in serum
      samples from 106 IBD patients (53 with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 53 with
      Crohn's disease (CD)) and from 30 healthy controls. Serum Se concentrations were 
      significantly lower in UC and CD patients than in healthy controls (p < 0.001)
      and significantly lower in CD patients than in UC patients (p = 0.006). Se
      concentrations in patients were significantly influenced by sex, body mass index 
      (BMI), the inflammatory biomarker alpha-1-antitrypsin, surgery, medical
      treatment, the severity, extent, and form of the disease and the length of time
      since onset (p < 0.05). Se concentrations in IBD patients were positively and
      linearly correlated with nutritional (protein, albumin, prealbumin,
      cholinesterase and total cholesterol) and iron status-related (hemoglobin, Fe and
      hematocrit) parameters (p < 0.05). A greater impairment of serum Se and
      cardiovascular status was observed in CD than in UC patients. An adequate
      nutritional Se status is important in IBD patients to minimize the cardiovascular
      risk associated with increased inflammation biomarkers, especially in
      undernourished CD patients, and is also related to an improved nutritional and
      body iron status.

TI  - C-reactive protein as a diagnostic and prognostic factor in inflammatory bowel
      diseases.
PG  - 1124-1130
AB  - AIM: The study aimed to evaluate high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) as a diagnostic and
      predictive marker in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
      MATERIAL/METHODS: Medical history of 106 patients with IBD revealed hsCRP
      concentrations at diagnosis and during the follow-up period. RESULTS: The study
      showed that the majority of investigated patients had elevated hsCRP
      concentrations at diagnosis, although the mean concentration was much higher in
      the group of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) than the group with ulcerative
      colitis (UC) (P<0.001). The overall decrease in mean hsCRP concentration observed
      during the follow-up period was larger in the group of CD patients. The analysis 
      showed a correlation between hsCRP concentrations at diagnosis and risk of
      surgery in the group of CD patients (r=0.408, P=0.002), but not in the group of
      UC patients. In a logistic regression analysis, surgery in CD patients was
      associated with age (OR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.8-1.0, P=0.05) and hsCRP concentration
      (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.0-1.04, P=0.03) at diagnosis. DISCUSSION: HsCRP might be a
      useful diagnostic marker in differentiating active IBD from other diseases.
      Particularly important however seems to be the predictive value of hsCRP at
      diagnosis in prognosing the clinical outcome of the disease in CD patients.

TI  - Current evaluation and management of anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 19-32
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Anemia is a common extraintestinal manifestation in IBD patients
      and considerably impacts disease prognosis, hospitalization rates and time lost
      from work. While iron deficiency anemia is predominant, combinations of
      hematimetric and biochemical markers enable detection and targeted therapy of
      other etiologies including vitamin B12/folic acid deficiencies, hemolysis,
      myelosuppression and pharmacotherapies. Areas covered: Current literature was
      searched for articles focusing on etiology, diagnostics and therapy of anemia in 
      IBD. In the light of their own experience, the authors describe the physiology of
      anemia in IBD and present current evidence endorsing diagnostic and therapeutic
      options, focusing particularly on non-iron-related etiologies. Expert commentary:
      Anemia in IBD is polyetiological, reaching far beyond iron deficiency anemia.
      While clinicians need to be aware of the increasing pallet of diagnostic tools
      and therapeutic options, detailed studies are needed to develop more convenient
      test procedures, long-term treatment and monitoring strategies, and unified
      guidelines for daily practice.

TI  - Outcomes of exclusive enteral nutrition in paediatric Crohn's disease.
PG  - 185-191
LID - 10.1038/ejcn.2016.210 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is a safe and effective 
      treatment modality for inducing remission in paediatric Crohn's disease (CD). The
      primary aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of EEN to corticosteroid
      (CS) therapy in newly diagnosed, treatment-naive patients with CD. A secondary
      aim was to describe the outcomes of EEN in a national cohort of paediatric CD
      patients over a 10-year period. SUBJECTS/METHODS: A retrospective chart review
      was conducted at the Irish national referral centre for paediatric CD. A
      case-matched analysis was conducted on two cohorts matched for age, gender,
      disease location, disease behaviour and disease activity, who received CS or EEN 
      as their initial treatment. Subsequently, cohort analysis was conducted on all
      patients who undertook a course of EEN therapy between 2004 and 2013. RESULTS:
      The case-matched analysis found higher remission rates after treatment with EEN
      (24/28, 86%) compared with those with CS (15/28, 54%; P=0.02). Dietetic contacts 
      were found to be pivotal to the success of treatment and the attainment of
      remission. In total, 59 patients completed EEN at some time-point in their
      disease course and were included in the cohort analysis. Sixty-nine per cent of
      this cohort entered clinical remission (41/59). EEN was found to be most
      effective when used as an initial treatment (P=0.004) and less effective in
      patients aged under 10 years (P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: EEN should be strongly
      considered as a favourable primary treatment over CS, especially in those
      diagnosed over the age of 10 years.

      disease.
PG  - 13419
LID - 10.1038/ncomms13419 [doi]
AB  - Intestinal microbial dysbiosis is associated with Crohn's disease (CD). However, 
      the mechanisms leading to the chronic mucosal inflammation that characterizes
      this disease remain unclear. In this report, we use systems-level approaches to
      study the interactions between the gut microbiota and host in new-onset
      paediatric patients to evaluate causality and mechanisms of disease. We report an
      altered host proteome in CD patients indicative of impaired mitochondrial
      functions. In particular, mitochondrial proteins implicated in H2S detoxification
      are downregulated, while the relative abundance of H2S microbial producers is
      increased. Network correlation analysis reveals that Atopobium parvulum controls 
      the central hub of H2S producers. A. parvulum induces pancolitis in
      colitis-susceptible interleukin-10-deficient mice and this phenotype requires the
      presence of the intestinal microbiota. Administrating the H2S scavenger bismuth
      mitigates A. parvulum-induced colitis in vivo. This study reveals that
      host-microbiota interactions are disturbed in CD and thus provides mechanistic
      insights into CD pathogenesis.

TI  - Radiologic Predictors of Surgery in Newly Diagnosed Pediatric Crohn Disease
      Patients.
PG  - e182-e185
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to assess whether small bowel
      imaging conducted at the time of diagnosis could be used as a predictor of small 
      bowel surgical intervention in a population of pediatric patients with Crohn
      disease (CD). METHODS: A retrospective analysis of small bowel imaging within 30 
      days of diagnosis of pediatric CD was conducted. Patients were divided into 2
      groups based on small bowel imaging: those with no or minor abnormalities (71%)
      and those with more extensive or obstructive abnormalities (29%). Medical records
      were reviewed for small bowel surgical intervention and clinic follow-up visits. 
      RESULTS: A total of 232 patients were included in the study group (average age at
      diagnosis 11.7 years). Twenty-seven patients (12%) underwent small bowel surgical
      intervention. The relative risk for small bowel surgical intervention was 2.91 in
      the group with more extensive imaging abnormalities. The majority of increased
      surgical risk occurred in the first year after diagnosis, when the normal-minor
      group had a 2% surgical risk and the more abnormal group had a 17% surgical risk.
      Both groups had a 2% to 3% surgical risk per year after the first year.
      CONCLUSIONS: Small bowel imaging at the time of diagnosis in pediatric CD can
      help predict the risk of small bowel surgical intervention and should be
      recommended for all newly diagnosed patients. Nearly one third of our cohort
      underwent small bowel surgical intervention through 8 years of follow-up.
      Surgical complications of CD often occur in the small bowel, and counseling
      families about surgical risk is an integral part of pediatric CD management.

TI  - Serum Albumin and C-Reactive Protein/Albumin Ratio Are Useful Biomarkers of
      Crohn's Disease Activity.
PG  - 4393-4400
AB  - BACKGROUND Serum albumin (ALB) may be low during acute inflammation, but it is
      also affected by nutritional status. Therefore, we hypothesized that ALB and the 
      C-reactive protein/ALB ratio (CRP/ALB) may be associated with disease activity in
      patients with Crohn's disease (CD). MATERIAL AND METHODS Altogether, 100 patients
      with CD and 100 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers were retrospectively
      enrolled in the current study. The patients with CD were subdivided into patients
      with active disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index >150) and those in remission.
      ALB levels, CRP levels, and lipid pro fi les were measured. RESULTS ALB and CRP
      levels and the CRP/ALB ratio were the most useful for differentiating between
      active and nonactive CD. ALB levels (r=-0.50, P<0.01), CRP levels (r=0.39,
      P<0.01), and CRP/ALB ratio (r=0.42, P<0.01) all correlated with CD activity.
      These correlations were more prominent in males. Receiver Operating
      Characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated that the area under the curve (AUC)
      representing ALB (0.79) was higher than the AUC representing CRP (0.73) or
      CRP/ALB ratio (0.75; P>0.05). The AUCs corresponding to ALB level, CRP level, and
      CRP/ALB ratio were more prominent in males versus females (P<0.05). CRP level
      (14.55 mg/L), ALB level (34.35 g/L), and CRP/ALB ratio (0.69) had sensitivities
      of 67.7%, 72.6%, and 59.7%, and speci fi cities of 73.7%, 78.9%, and 81.6%,
      respectively, for CD activity. CONCLUSIONS In the present retrospective study, we
      found that ALB level and CRP/ALB ratio were useful biomarkers for identifying CD 
      activity, especially in males. These results suggest that, in addition to
      inflammation, assessment of patient nutritional status could also aid in
      identifying CD activity.

TI  - Endoscopic and clinical responses to anti-tubercular therapy can differentiate
      intestinal tuberculosis from Crohn's disease.
PG  - 27-36
LID - 10.1111/apt.13840 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Differentiation between intestinal tuberculosis and Crohn's disease
      is difficult and may require therapeutic trial with anti-tubercular therapy in
      tuberculosis-endemic regions. AIM: To evaluate the role of therapeutic trial with
      anti-tubercular therapy in patients with diagnostic confusion between intestinal 
      tuberculosis and Crohn's disease. METHODS: We performed retrospective-comparative
      (n = 288: 131 patients who received anti-tubercular therapy before being
      diagnosed as Crohn's disease and 157 intestinal tuberculosis patients) and
      prospective-validation study (n = 55 patients with diagnostic confusion of
      intestinal tuberculosis/Crohn's disease). Outcomes assessed were global
      symptomatic response and endoscopic mucosal healing. RESULTS: In the derivation
      cohort, among those eventually diagnosed as Crohn's disease, global symptomatic
      response with anti-tubercular therapy was seen in 38% at 3 months and in 37% who 
      completed 6 months of anti-tubercular therapy. Ninety-four per cent of intestinal
      tuberculosis patients showed global symptomatic response by 3 months. Endoscopic 
      mucosal healing was seen in only 5% of patients with Crohn's disease compared
      with 100% of intestinal tuberculosis patients. In the validation cohort, all the 
      patients with intestinal tuberculosis had symptomatic response and endoscopic
      mucosal healing after 6 months of anti-tubercular therapy. Among the patients
      with an eventual diagnosis of Crohn's disease, symptomatic response was seen in
      64% at 2 months and in 31% who completed 6 months of anti-tubercular therapy,
      none had mucosal healing. CONCLUSIONS: Disproportionately lower mucosal healing
      rate despite an overall symptom response with 6 months of anti-tubercular therapy
      in patients with Crohn's disease suggests a need for repeat colonoscopy for
      diagnosing Crohn's disease. Patients with intestinal tuberculosis showing
      significant symptomatic response after 2-3 months of anti-tubercular therapy,
      suggest that symptom persistence after a therapeutic trial of 3 months of
      anti-tubercular therapy may indicate the diagnosis of Crohn's disease.

TI  - Nutrition, oxidative stress and intestinal dysbiosis: Influence of diet on gut
      microbiota in inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 461-466
LID - 10.5507/bp.2016.052 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microbiota refers to the population of microorganisms (bacteria,
      viruses and fungi) that inhabit the entire gastrointestinal tract, more
      particularly the colon whose role is to maintain the integrity of the intestinal 
      mucosa and control the proliferation of pathogenic bacteria. Alteration in the
      composition of the gut microbiota is called dysbiosis. Dysbiosis redisposes to
      inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease and
      indeterminate colitis. METHODS: The purpose of this literature review is to
      elucidate the influence of diet on the composition of the gastrointestinal
      microbiota in the healthy gut and the role of diet in the development of
      dysbiosis. CONCLUSION: The "Western diet", in particular a low - fiber high
      fat/high carbohydrate diet is one factor that can lead to severe dysbiosis. In
      contrast, "mediterranean" and vegetarian diets that includes abundant fruits,
      vegetables, olive oil and oily fish are known for their anti-inflammatory effects
      and could prevent dysbiosis and subsequent inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Neutrophil volume distribution width as a new marker in detecting inflammatory
      bowel disease activation.
PG  - 51-57
LID - 10.1111/ijlh.12574 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: We sought to investigate the value of neutrophil volume
      distribution width in detecting inflammatory bowel disease activation. METHODS:
      Patients with infection and accompanying inflammatory disease were excluded. All 
      the patients were diagnosed and classified according to Porto criteria and Paris 
      classification, respectively. Physician global assessment, pediatric Crohn's
      disease and pediatric ulcerative colitis activity indexes and fecal calprotectin 
      were used to define disease activation. RESULTS: A total of 34 pediatric patients
      with Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and 29 controls were enrolled in the
      study. Neutrophil volume distribution width (NVDW) was significantly higher in
      patients with IBD compared to healthy controls (P < 0.001). An increased NVDW
      level was observed in IBD patients in activation (22.42 +/- 2.13) compared to
      those in remission (19.22 +/- 1.63) (P < 0.001). There was no statistically
      significant difference between IBD patients in remission and healthy controls.
      The best cutoff of NVDW for prediction of disease activation in Crohn's disease
      and ulcerative colitis in this series was 20.39 with a sensitivity of 90.9% and a
      specificity of 75% (AUC: 0.852 CI: 0.698-1.000 P < 0.001) and 19.74 with a
      sensitivity of 92.9% and a specificity of 90.9% (AUC: 0.961, CI: 0.889-1.000, P <
      0.001), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: As a quantitative, objective, and sensitive
      parameter, we believe that the NVDW has a potential to be an additional test
      detecting disease activation in IBD.

TI  - Patient optimization for surgery relating to Crohn's disease.
PG  - 707-719
LID - 10.1038/nrgastro.2016.158 [doi]
AB  - The majority of patients with Crohn's disease require abdominal surgery during
      their lifetime, some of whom will require multiple operations. Postoperative
      complications are seen more frequently in patients requiring abdominal surgery
      for Crohn's disease than in patients requiring abdominal surgery for other
      conditions. In this article, we review the evidence supporting preoperative
      optimization, discussing strategies that potentially improve surgical outcomes
      and reduce perioperative morbidity and mortality. We discuss the roles of
      adequate cross-sectional imaging, nutritional optimization, appropriate
      adjustments of medical therapy, management of preoperative abscesses and
      phlegmons, smoking cessation and thromboembolic prophylaxis. We also review
      operation-related factors, and discuss their potential implications with respect 
      to postoperative complications. Overall, the literature suggests that
      preoperative management has a major effect on postoperative outcomes.

TI  - The role of exclusive enteral nutrition in the management of orofacial
      granulomatosis in children.
PG  - 421-424
AB  - BACKGROUND: Orofacial granulomatosis (OFG) is a term used to describe a
      persistent, painless swelling of lips and orofacial region. It can be associated 
      with ulceration, gingival hypertrophy and cobble stone appearance of the buccal
      mucosa. OFG is commonly associated with Crohn's disease and can precede the
      intestinal manifestation of the disease. Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is a
      recognized treatment for induction of remission for Crohn's disease. The aim of
      this study was to review the use of EEN in the management of OFG in children.
      METHODS: Retrospective review of medical records of all children diagnosed with
      OFG between 2007 and 2012 was conducted. Presence of comorbidities, progression
      to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and response to EEN was evaluated. RESULTS:
      Twenty-nine children were included, mean age at diagnosis was 9 years (standard
      deviation 3.9) years. Ten children had isolated OFG and 19 had OFG and IBD, of
      which 12 presented with OFG and IBD and 7 developed IBD later. Median time to
      progression to IBD was 33 months (inter quartile range: 9.8-85.5). Twenty-two
      children completed 6 weeks of EEN, and 19 showed clinical improvement in the OFG 
      appearance. CONCLUSION: EEN appears to be an effective treatment option for
      children with isolated OFG or OFG and IBD.

TI  - Early Changes in Microbial Community Structure Are Associated with Sustained
      Remission After Nutritional Treatment of Pediatric Crohn's Disease.
PG  - 2853-2862
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical remission achieved by exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is
      associated with marked microbiome changes. In this prospective study of exclusive
      enteral nutrition, we employ a hierarchical model of microbial community
      structure to distinguish between pediatric Crohn's disease patients who achieved 
      sustained remission (SR) and those who relapsed early (non-SR), after restarting 
      a normal diet. METHODS: Fecal samples were obtained from 10 patients (age 10-16) 
      and from 5 healthy controls (age 9-14). The microbiota was assessed via 16S rRNA 
      sequencing. In addition to standard measures of microbial biodiversity, we
      employed Bayesian methods to characterize the hierarchical community structure.
      Community structure between patients who sustained remission (wPCDAI <12.5) up to
      their 24-week follow-up (SR) was compared with patients that had not sustained
      remission (non-SR). RESULTS: Microbial diversity was lower in Crohn's disease
      patients relative to controls and lowest in patients who did not achieve SR. SR
      patients differed from non-SR patients in terms of the structure and prevalence
      of their microbial communities. The SR prevalent community contained a number of 
      strains of Akkermansia muciniphila and Bacteroides and was limited in
      Proteobacteria, whereas the non-SR prevalent community had a large Proteobacteria
      component. Their communities were so different that a model trained to
      discriminate SR and non-SR had 80% classification accuracy, already at baseline
      sampling. CONCLUSIONS: Microbial community structure differs between healthy
      controls, patients who have an enduring response to exclusive enteral nutrition, 
      and those who relapse early on introduction of normal diet. Our novel Bayesian
      approach to these differences is able to predict sustained remission after
      exclusive enteral nutrition.

TI  - Development of an index to define overall disease severity in IBD.
PG  - 244-254
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2016-312648 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Disease activity for Crohn's disease (CD) and UC is typically
      defined based on symptoms at a moment in time, and ignores the long-term burden
      of disease. The aims of this study were to select the attributes determining
      overall disease severity, to rank the importance of and to score these individual
      attributes for both CD and UC. METHODS: Using a modified Delphi panel, 14 members
      of the International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases
      (IOIBD) selected the most important attributes related to IBD. Eighteen IOIBD
      members then completed a statistical exercise (conjoint analysis) to create a
      relative ranking of these attributes. Adjusted utilities were developed by
      creating proportions for each level within an attribute. RESULTS: For CD, 15.8%
      of overall disease severity was attributed to the presence of mucosal lesions,
      10.9% to history of a fistula, 9.7% to history of abscess and 7.4% to history of 
      intestinal resection. For UC, 18.1% of overall disease severity was attributed to
      mucosal lesions, followed by 14.0% for impact on daily activities, 11.2% C
      reactive protein and 10.1% for prior experience with biologics. Overall disease
      severity indices were created on a 100-point scale by applying each attribute's
      average importance to the adjusted utilities. CONCLUSIONS: Based on specialist
      opinion, overall CD severity was associated more with intestinal damage, in
      contrast to overall UC disease severity, which was more dependent on symptoms and
      impact on daily life. Once validated, disease severity indices may provide a
      useful tool for consistent assessment of overall disease severity in patients
      with IBD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the longitudinal clinical and electrophysiological
      patterns of thalidomide neuropathy in children and adolescents. STUDY DESIGN:
      Retrospective analysis of clinical records at a tertiary care children's
      hospital, including serial electrophysiological studies. RESULTS: Sixteen
      patients aged 6-24 years received thalidomide to treat Crohn's disease from 2002 
      to 2012. Nine subjects had electrophysiological evidence of sensorimotor axonal
      polyneuropathy, 8 of whom had sensory and/or motor symptoms. The patients with
      polyneuropathy received thalidomide for 5 weeks to 52 months, with cumulative
      doses ranging from 1.4 to 207.7 g. All subjects with cumulative doses greater
      than 60 g developed polyneuropathy, and 4 of the 5 subjects who received
      thalidomide for more than 20 months developed polyneuropathy. The 7 subjects who 
      had normal neurophysiological studies received therapy for 1 week to 25 months,
      with cumulative doses ranging from 0.7 to 47 g. In contrast to some previous
      reports, several patients had sensorimotor polyneuropathies, rather than pure
      sensory neuropathies. In patients with neuropathy who received therapy for more
      than 24 months and had 3 or more electromyography studies, the severity of the
      neuropathy plateaued. CONCLUSIONS: Factors in addition to the total dose may
      contribute to the risk profile for thalidomide neuropathy, including
      pharmacogenetic susceptibilities. The severity of the neuropathy does not worsen 
      relentlessly. Children, adolescents, and young adults receiving thalidomide
      should undergo regular neurophysiological studies to monitor for neuropathy.

AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: Compared with patients with other benign intestinal conditions,
      patients with CD are at increased risk of developing postoperative complications 
      following intestinal resection. We searched for useful tools for predicting
      postoperative complication in patients with CD by comparing the relationship
      between postoperative morbidity in these patients as measured by three different 
      scoring tools: general surgical risk (POSSUM score), disease activity (CDAI), and
      nutritional screening (nutritional prognostic index). METHODS: We performed a
      retrospective review of 50 patients with small bowel CD who underwent surgical
      resection and primary anastomosis between 1999 and 2014. RESULTS: This study
      enrolled 34 men and 16 women. The mean age was 38.4 years (range: 20-81 years).
      There was no postoperative mortality. The overall postoperative morbidity rate
      (33.7%) predicted by POSSUM was similar to the rate in the study patients
      (36.0%). Although POSSUM score predicted higher postoperative morbidity rates in 
      patients who underwent emergency surgery (estimated morbidity: 52.8%), the actual
      postoperative morbidity rate in the emergency surgery group (26.7%) was smaller
      than in the elective surgery group (40.0%). In addition, neither preoperative
      nutritional status nor POSSUM score was related to the severity of postoperative 
      complications. CDAI score was significantly related to the severity of
      postoperative complications (P=0.032). CONCLUSION: Based on the above results, a 
      high preoperative CDAI score can predict negative postoperative outcomes. We
      believe that disease activity should be controlled using various treatment
      modalities, such as enteral or total parenteral nutrition as well as medication, 
      before performing surgery in patients with CD.

TI  - Long-Term Disease Course and Pregnancy Outcomes in Women with Inflammatory Bowel 
      Disease: An Indian Cohort Study.
PG  - 2054-2062
LID - 10.1007/s10620-016-4353-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The literature on interaction between pregnancy and inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) is inconsistent, and there are no reports on this aspect from
      Asia. This study evaluated the impact both IBD and pregnancy have on each other
      in a large cohort of Indian patients. METHODS: In total, 514 females with
      ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) aged between 18 and 45 years
      attending IBD clinic, at our institute, from July 2004 to July 2013 were
      screened, and patients with data on pregnancy status were included (n = 406).
      Pregnancies were categorized as either before, after or coinciding with disease
      onset. Long-term disease course was ascertained from prospectively maintained
      records. Pregnancy and fetal outcomes were recorded from antenatal records or
      individual interviews. RESULTS: Of 406 patients (UC: 336, CD: 70), 310 became
      pregnant (UC: 256, CD: 54), with a total of 597 pregnancies (UC: 524, CD: 73).
      More UC patients with pregnancies were in long-term remission than non-pregnant
      patients (56.7 vs. 43.4 %, p = 0.04). Long-term remission was less frequent in UC
      patients in whom pregnancy coincided with disease onset than patients with
      pregnancies before and after/pregnancy after the disease onset (41.4 vs. 62.5 %, 
      p = 0.023). Pregnancies after the disease onset were associated with more
      cesarean sections and adverse fetal outcomes than pregnancies before disease
      onset in both UC and CD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term disease course in UC
      patients was better in pregnant as compared to non-pregnant patients. Among
      pregnant UC patients, disease course was worst when pregnancy coincided with
      disease onset. Pregnancy and fetal outcomes were worse in pregnancy after disease
      onset than pregnancy before disease onset.

TI  - Reflections About Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Vitamins A and D.
PG  - 1105-1110
AB  - Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are two major forms of the inflammatory
      bowel diseases (IBDs). Vitamin A (VA) and vitamin D (VD) may be associated with
      reduction in inflammation in these disorders. The aim of this review was to show 
      the current evidence that may associate VA and VD with IBDs. Data linking VA, VD,
      and IBDs were studied. Both VA and VD may be related to the immune system in
      different manners. The active form of VA, retinoic acid, may be related to the
      growth factor-beta and release of interleukin-10 (IL-10), thus involved with the 
      resolution of the inflammation. Its deficiency is associated with the increase of
      disease activity. The active form of VD is 1,25(OH)2D3 that produces biological
      effects via the nuclear hormone receptor named VD receptor (VDR), which may
      interfere with the immune cells and macrophages leading to the suppression of the
      inflammatory process by decreasing the release of TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-6, and
      IL-8, IL-12, and IL-23. VDR may also activate nucleotide-binding oligomerization 
      domain 2 expression and stimulate the production of the defensin and cathelicidin
      that are important to the homeostasis of the mucosal immune barrier. The use of
      VA and VD could be helpful in the treatment and prevention of IBDs but more
      studies are necessary to establish the precise role of these compounds in the
      prevention or remission of these inflammatory processes.

TI  - Is Modern Medical Management Changing Ultimate Patient Outcomes in Inflammatory
      Bowel Disease?
PG  - 1867-1873
AB  - BACKGROUND: The impact of modern medical management of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) on surgical necessity and outcomes remains unclear. We hypothesized that
      surgery rates have decreased while outcomes have worsened due to operating on
      "sicker" patients since the introduction of biologic medications. METHODS: The
      Nationwide Inpatient Sample and ICD-9-CM codes were used to identify inpatient
      admissions for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Trends in IBD nutrition,
      surgeries, and postoperative complications were determined. RESULTS: There were
      191,743 admissions for IBD during the study period. Surgery rates were largely
      unchanged over the study period, ranging from 9 to 12 % of admissions in both
      Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The rate of poor nutrition increased by
      67 % in ulcerative colitis and by 83 % in Crohn's disease. Rates of postoperative
      anastomotic leak (10.2-13.9 %) were unchanged over the years. Postoperative
      infection rates decreased by 17 % in Crohn's disease (18 % in 2003 to 15 % in
      2012; P < 0.001) but did not show a trend in any direction in ulcerative colitis.
      CONCLUSIONS: Rates of IBD surgery have remained stable while postoperative
      infectious complications have remained stable or decreased since the
      implementation of biologic therapies. We identified an increase in poor nutrition
      in surgical patients.

PG  - 494-499
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Transition readiness assessment has focused attention on adolescent
      knowledge and skills, but data-driven benchmarks have not been established.
      METHODS: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ages 25 to 50 years,
      attending an outpatient gastroenterology clinic, were recruited to complete a
      voluntary, confidential survey asking patients to recall medications and
      potential side effects, and to rate their degree of independence performing
      health maintenance tasks. RESULTS: The 141 respondents (48% response rate) had
      mean age of 36 years with median disease duration of 11 years. They were 60%
      female, 54% had Crohn disease, and 23% were diagnosed before age 18. Nearly all
      patients were fully independent answering doctor's questions during the visit
      (93%) and scheduling office visits (92%). Excluding pharmacy pick up, full
      independence seen in only 57%, whereas 16% significantly delegated tasks. No
      differences by sex, disease type, medication class, age at disease onset, or
      disease duration were found across levels of self-management. Almost all (97%)
      respondents could recall medication name, whereas fewer were able to recall dose 
      (63%) or frequency (65%). Side effect knowledge was poor; among 81 patients on a 
      biologic or immunomodulator, only 17 (21%) cited cancer and 22 (27%) cited
      infection. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent IBD transition programs now have empirical
      data from the present study about adult benchmarks for independence in
      self-management skills. Further research can establish which skills correlate
      with medication adherence and active collaboration with the medical team. The
      present study also exposes important gaps in medication risk knowledge and may
      allow improved patient education for subgroups of adult patients with IBD.

TI  - The Gut Microbiome of Pediatric Crohn's Disease Patients Differs from Healthy
      Controls in Genes That Can Influence the Balance Between a Healthy and
      Dysregulated Immune Response.
PG  - 2607-2618
AB  - BACKGROUND: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is a first-line therapy in
      pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) thought to induce remission through changes in the
      gut microbiome. With microbiome assessment largely focused on microbial taxonomy 
      and diversity, it remains unclear to what extent EEN induces functional changes
      that thereby contribute to its therapeutic effect. METHODS: Fecal samples were
      collected from 15 pediatric CD patients prior to and after EEN treatment, as well
      as from 5 healthy controls. Metagenomic data were obtained via next-generation
      sequencing, and nonhuman reads were mapped to KEGG pathways, where possible.
      Pathway abundance was compared between CD patients and controls, and between CD
      patients that sustained remission (SR) and those that did not sustain remission
      (NSR). RESULTS: Of 132 KEGG pathways identified, 8 pathways differed
      significantly between baseline CD patients and controls. Examination of these
      eight pathways showed SR patients had greater similarity to controls than NSR
      patients in all cases. Pathways fell into one of three groups: 1) no prior
      connection to IBD, 2) previously reported connection to IBD, and 3) known roles
      in innate immunity and immunoregulation. CONCLUSIONS: The microbiota of CD
      patients and controls represent alternative ecological states that have broad
      differences in functional capabilities, including xenobiotic and environmental
      pollutant degradation, succinate metavolism, and bacterial HtpG, all of which can
      affect barrier integrity and immune regulation. Moreover, our finding that SR
      patients were more similar to healthy controls suggests that community microbial 
      function, as inferred from fecal microbiomes, could serve as a valuable
      diagnostic tool.

TI  - Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Connect: A Novel Volunteer Program for
      Hospitalized Patients with IBD and Their Families.
PG  - 2748-2753
AB  - Patients with inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) often require hospitalization and 
      this experience is stressful. Health care providers frequently do not have
      adequate time to address the emotional impact of the hospitalization on the
      patient and family. Nonmedical support for inpatients was identified as an unmet 
      need by a Crohn's disease patient's family. This led to the development of a
      volunteer peer specialist network, IBD Connect, where peer volunteers visit
      hospitalized patients with IBD to offer emotional support and educational
      materials. We aimed to determine the feasibility of incorporating IBD Connect
      into an inpatient IBD service, evaluate the impact of IBD Connect on patients'
      willingness to share their disease experience with family and friends, and
      improve stress. Since the inception of IBD Connect in 2012, peer volunteers have 
      made 1469 total visits to 677 unique inpatients. Patient satisfaction of IBD
      Connect has been favorable with a significant decrease in stress related to the
      hospitalization. Similarly, there was significant increase in patients sharing
      their IBD diagnosis and experience with family and friends. Patients and their
      families are willing to share important information and ask questions to
      volunteers that may not have been discussed with their health care providers. In 
      an era of patient-reported outcomes and patient-centered care, peer volunteers
      are an important component of chronic disease management and should be
      incorporated into IBD inpatient health care teams.

TI  - Incidence of Bowel Surgery and Associated Risk Factors in Pediatric-Onset Crohn's
      Disease.
PG  - 2917-2923
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data describing the incidence and the risk factors for surgical
      interventions in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) is inconsistent. Our aim was to
      describe the rates of intestinal surgery and to identify associated risk factors 
      in a large cohort of children with CD. METHODS: Medical charts of 482 children
      with CD from the Schneider Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease cohort who were
      diagnosed between 1981 and 2013 were carefully reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS:
      Of 482 patients, 143 (29.7%) underwent intestinal surgery with a median follow-up
      time of 8.6 years (range, 1-30.5). Kaplan-Meier survival estimates of the
      cumulative probability of CD-related intestinal surgery were 14.2% at 5 years and
      24.5% at 10 years from diagnosis. Of these, 14% needed more than one operation.
      Multivariate Cox models showed that isolated ileal disease (hazard ratio [HR]
      2.39, P = 0.008), complicated behavior (penetrating or stricturing) (HR 2.44, P <
      0.001) and higher severity indices, at diagnosis, including Harvey-Bradshaw (HR
      1.06, P = 0.009) and short Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (HR 1.02, P =
      0.001) were associated with increased risk for intestinal surgery. Age, gender,
      family history of CD, early introduction of immunomodulators, treatment with
      anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha, or diagnosis before the year 2000 did not
      affect the risk of bowel surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Ileal location, complicated
      behavior, and higher disease activity indices at diagnosis are independent risk
      factors for bowel surgery, whereas anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha treatment and
      diagnosis during the "biological era" are not associated with diminished
      long-term surgical risk.

TI  - Serologic Anti-GP2 Antibodies Are Associated with Genetic Polymorphisms,
      Fibrostenosis, and Need for Surgical Resection in Crohn's Disease.
PG  - 2648-2657
AB  - BACKGROUND: The presentation of Crohn's disease (CD) is heterogeneous and often
      leads to serious complications and need for surgery. We tested serum anti-zymogen
      granule glycoprotein 2 (GP2) antibodies, including its novel isoform alpha, for
      association with genetic variants, diagnosis, disease stratification, and
      prediction of CD courses in a combined cross-sectional and cohort study. METHODS:
      Serum samples of 303 CD, 108 ulcerative colitis, 72 other inflammatory
      gastrointestinal diseases, and 206 controls without predominant gastrointestinal 
      diseases controls (HC) were tested for the presence of Anti-GP2 and
      Anti-Saccharomyces cervisiae (ASCA) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Genetic
      analysis was performed using the Illumina Immunochip. RESULTS: GP2 IgA and IgG
      had the highest discriminatory capability for CD versus ulcerative colitis and CD
      versus inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases. We identified an association of
      GP2 IgA and IgG each with 5 distinct single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Levels of
      anti-GP2 IgG were moderately associated with ileal disease location.
      Interestingly, both, anti-GP2 IgA and IgG were exclusively associated with the
      occurrence of stenosis and need for surgery, independently of disease location,
      but not with fistulizing CD, early disease onset or disease activity. ASCA IgG
      and IgA were qualitatively and quantitatively linked to CD, CD complications, and
      need for surgery. Increased levels of ASCA IgG and IgA and positivity for ASCA
      IgG, but neither levels nor positivity for GP2 IgG or IgA were predictive of the 
      earlier occurrence of complications or surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-GP2 antibodies 
      may aid as a tool for diagnosis and differentiation of CD and could indicate a
      more complicated CD course.

      Consecutive patients with CD in clinical remission (Harvey-Bradshaw Index </= 4) 
      with good quality of life (short inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire score
      >/= 50), and same day CRP measurement at first encounter, followed for a minimum 
      of 4 years formed the study population. Disease trajectory was determined using
      change in Lemann Index as a measure of bowel damage. RESULTS: A total of 185
      patients with CD (median age 42 years; 51.4% men) were included in the study. CRP
      elevation was observed in 43 (23%) patients (Silent CD cohort). Majority of them 
      showed worsening disease trajectories based on change in Lemann Index when
      compared with asymptomatic patients with normal CRP (65% versus 36%, P < 0.0001).
      Multinomial logistic regression analysis demonstrated that elevated CRP was
      independently associated with 7-fold higher odds (odds ratio = 6.93, P < 0.0001) 
      of having worse disease trajectories when compared with stable disease
      trajectories. CONCLUSIONS: Two-thirds of patients with CD in clinical remission, 
      while demonstrating elevated CRP, will develop bowel damage over the ensuing
      years, despite feeling well. These patients with silent CD are an "at-risk" group
      who warrant further investigation to prevent development of disease-related
      complications.

TI  - A Low Neutrophil CD64 Index Is Associated with Sustained Remission During
      Infliximab Maintenance Therapy.
PG  - 2641-2647
AB  - BACKGROUND: We have previously shown that CD64 surface expression on circulating 
      neutrophils is significantly elevated in children with newly diagnosed Crohn's
      disease (CD). Our primary aim was to investigate whether elevations in neutrophil
      CD64 in asymptomatic patients could be used to predict treatment failure during
      maintenance infliximab. METHODS: Pediatric CD subjects receiving maintenance
      infliximab in clinical remission (short pediatric CD activity index [shPCDAI]
      <15) were enrolled. We measured neutrophil CD64 expression (CD64 index, Trillium 
      Diagnostics, LLC) and infliximab trough concentrations. Infliximab failure was
      defined as an shPCDAI >15 on 2 consecutive infusions, discontinuation of
      infliximab, hospitalization, endoscopic ulcerations, or surgery during the
      following year of maintenance infliximab. RESULTS: We enrolled 36 subjects, 22/36
      were male and 29/36 were white. Mean (SD) age at study entry was 15 (4) years
      with a median of 14 (5-20) infusions before study entry. 4/36 were receiving a
      concurrent immunomodulator. Over 1 year, 15/36 subjects were classified as
      infliximab failures. Asymptomatic subjects with a neutrophil CD64 index >1 at
      study entry had a higher probability of treatment failure compared with
      asymptomatic subjects with a CD64 index <1 (log-rank = 0.002). We found only
      neutrophil CD64 index >1 and nonwhite race were risk factors for treatment
      failure by univariate regression analysis. We found no difference in the mean
      infliximab trough concentration at study entry between treatment failures (2.8
      mug/mL, SD, 1.2) and subjects remaining in remission on infliximab (4.2 mug/mL,
      SD, 3.4; P = 0.17). CONCLUSIONS: Neutrophil CD64 index >1 is a significant risk
      factor for treatment failure during infliximab maintenance therapy.

TI  - Patients Perceive Clinical Benefit with the Specific Carbohydrate Diet for
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
PG  - 3255-3260
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that dietary therapy may be effective for
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but limited published data exist 
      on the usage and efficacy of dietary therapy. AIM: To evaluate the perspective of
      IBD patients using the specific carbohydrate diet (SCD). METHODS: An anonymous
      online survey was conducted using REDCap, a Web-based survey tool. Survey links
      were sent to known Web sites as well as support groups in an attempt to
      characterize patient utilization of the SCD and perception of efficacy of the
      SCD. RESULTS: There were 417 respondents of the online survey on the SCD with
      IBD. Mean age for individuals on the SCD was 34.9 +/- 16.4 years. Seventy percent
      were female. Forty-seven percent had Crohn's disease, 43 % had ulcerative
      colitis, and 10 % had indeterminate colitis. Individuals perceived clinical
      improvement on the SCD. Four percent reported clinical remission prior to the
      SCD, while 33 % reported remission at 2 months after initiation of the SCD, and
      42 % at both 6 and 12 months. For those reporting clinical remission, 13 %
      reported time to achieve remission of less than 2 weeks, 17 % reported 2 weeks to
      a month, 36 % reported 1-3 months, and 34 % reported greater than 3 months. For
      individuals who reported reaching remission, 47 % of individuals reported
      associated improvement in abnormal laboratory values. CONCLUSIONS: The SCD is
      utilized by many patients as a primary and adjunct therapy for IBD. Most patients
      perceive clinical benefit to use of the SCD.

TI  - Development of an Inflammatory Bowel Disease Research Registry Derived from
      Observational Electronic Health Record Data for Comprehensive Clinical
      Phenotyping.
PG  - 3236-3245
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a heterogeneous collection of
      chronic inflammatory disorders of the digestive tract. Clinical, genetic, and
      pathological heterogeneity makes it increasingly difficult to translate efficacy 
      studies into real-world practice. Our objective was to develop a comprehensive
      natural history registry derived from multi-year observational data to facilitate
      effectiveness and clinical phenotypic research in IBD. METHODS: A longitudinal,
      consented registry with prospectively collected data was developed at UPMC. All
      adult IBD patients receiving care at the tertiary care center of UPMC are
      eligible for enrollment. Detailed data in the electronic health record are
      accessible for registry research purposes. Data are exported directly from the
      electronic health record and temporally organized for research. RESULTS: To date,
      there are over 2565 patients participating in the IBD research registry. All
      patients have demographic data, clinical disease characteristics, and disease
      course data including healthcare utilization, laboratory values, health-related
      questionnaires quantifying disease activity and quality of life, and analytical
      information on treatment, temporally organized for 6 years (2009-2015). The data 
      have resulted in a detailed definition of clinical phenotypes suitable for
      association studies with parameters of disease outcomes and treatment response.
      We have established the infrastructure required to examine the effectiveness of
      treatment and disease course in the real-world setting of IBD. CONCLUSIONS: The
      IBD research registry offers a unique opportunity to investigate clinical
      research questions regarding the natural course of the disease, phenotype
      association studies, effectiveness of treatment, and quality of care research.

TI  - Gastrointestinal Symptoms Predictors of Health-Related Quality of Life in
      Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
PG  - e186-e192
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate the multidimensional
      gastrointestinal symptoms predictors of generic health-related quality of life
      (HRQOL) in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease from the
      perspectives of pediatric patients and parents. METHODS: The Pediatric Quality of
      Life Inventory Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales and Pediatric Quality of Life
      Inventory 4.0 Generic Core Scales were completed in a 9-site study by 260
      families of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Gastrointestinal Symptoms
      Scales measuring stomach pain, food and drink limits, gas and bloating,
      constipation, blood in stool, and diarrhea were identified as clinically
      important symptom differentiators from healthy controls based on prior findings, 
      and subsequently tested for bivariate and multivariate linear associations with
      overall HRQOL (Generic Core Scales). RESULTS: Stomach pain, food and drink
      limits, gas and bloating, constipation, blood in stool, and diarrhea were
      significantly associated with decreased HRQOL in bivariate analyses (P < 0.001). 
      In predictive models utilizing hierarchical multiple regression analyses
      controlling for age, sex, and race/ethnicity, gastrointestinal symptoms accounted
      for an additional 40% of the variance in patient self-reported HRQOL (P < 0.001) 
      and 37% of the variance in parent proxy-reported HRQOL (P < 0.001), reflecting
      large effect sizes. Stomach pain, food and drink limits, and constipation were
      significant individual patient-reported predictors after controlling for the
      other gastrointestinal symptoms in the predictive models. CONCLUSIONS:
      Patient-reported gastrointestinal symptoms differentially predicted HRQOL.
      Identifying the specific gastrointestinal symptoms from a standardized
      multidimensional gastrointestinal symptoms profile that are the most important
      predictors from the patient perspective facilitates a patient-centered approach
      for interventions designed to ameliorate impaired HRQOL.

TI  - The fecal microbiota as a biomarker for disease activity in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 35216

AB  - Monitoring mucosal inflammation is crucial to prevent complications and disease
      progression in Crohn's disease (CD). Endoscopy is the current standard, but is
      invasive. Clinical activity scores and non-invasive biochemical markers do not
      correlate well with mucosal inflammation. Microbial perturbations have been
      associated with disease activity in CD. Therefore, we aimed to investigate its
      potential use to differentiate CD patients in remission from those with an
      exacerbation. From 71 CD patients repeated fecal samples were collected,
      resulting in 97 active disease and 97 remission samples based on a combination of
      biochemical and clinical parameters. The microbiota composition was assessed by
      pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA V1-V3 region. Random Forest analysis was used to
      find the most discriminatory panel of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) between 
      active and remission samples. An independent internal validation set was used to 
      validate the model. A combination of 50 OTUs was able to correctly predict 73% of
      remission and 79% of active samples with an AUC of 0.82 (sensitivity: 0.79,
      specificity: 0.73). This study demonstrates that fecal microbial profiles can be 
      used to differentiate between active and remission CD and underline the potential
      of the fecal microbiota as a non-invasive tool to monitor disease activity in CD.

      condition].
PG  - 43-46
AB  - In this review issues concerning bone metabolism are presented. The diagnostic
      criteria of decreased mineral bone density is discussed with the significance of 
      densitometry. The necessity of presence of low-trauma fracture to diagnosed the
      osteoporosis in children is signified. The paper reviews most common chronic
      gastrointestinal tract condition associated with the altered bone metabolism. The
      diagnostic and early treatment of decreased mineral bone density in children, who
      are before obtaining peak bone mass is crucial to prevent the risk of
      osteoporosis in adulthood.

TI  - Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies African-Specific Susceptibility Loci in 
      African Americans With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) ulcerative colitis (UC) 
      and Crohn's disease (CD) cause significant morbidity and are increasing in
      prevalence among all populations, including African Americans. More than 200
      susceptibility loci have been identified in populations of predominantly European
      ancestry, but few loci have been associated with IBD in other ethnicities.
      METHODS: We performed 2 high-density, genome-wide scans comprising 2345 cases of 
      African Americans with IBD (1646 with CD, 583 with UC, and 116 inflammatory bowel
      disease unclassified) and 5002 individuals without IBD (controls, identified from
      the Health Retirement Study and Kaiser Permanente database). Single-nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) associated at P < 5.0 x 10(-8) in meta-analysis with a
      nominal evidence (P < .05) in each scan were considered to have genome-wide
      significance. RESULTS: We detected SNPs at HLA-DRB1, and African-specific SNPs at
      ZNF649 and LSAMP, with associations of genome-wide significance for UC. We
      detected SNPs at USP25 with associations of genome-wide significance for IBD. No 
      associations of genome-wide significance were detected for CD. In addition, 9
      genes previously associated with IBD contained SNPs with significant evidence for
      replication (P < 1.6 x 10(-6)): ADCY3, CXCR6, HLA-DRB1 to HLA-DQA1 (genome-wide
      significance on conditioning), IL12B,PTGER4, and TNC for IBD; IL23R, PTGER4, and 
      SNX20 (in strong linkage disequilibrium with NOD2) for CD; and KCNQ2 (near
      TNFRSF6B) for UC. Several of these genes, such as TNC (near TNFSF15), CXCR6, and 
      genes associated with IBD at the HLA locus, contained SNPs with unique
      association patterns with African-specific alleles. CONCLUSIONS: We performed a
      genome-wide association study of African Americans with IBD and identified loci
      associated with UC in only this population; we also replicated IBD, CD, and UC
      loci identified in European populations. The detection of variants associated
      with IBD risk in only people of African descent demonstrates the importance of
      studying the genetics of IBD and other complex diseases in populations beyond
      those of European ancestry.

TI  - Ultrasound and MRI predictors of surgical bowel resection in pediatric Crohn
      disease.
PG  - 55-64

AB  - BACKGROUND: Imaging predictors for surgery in children with Crohn disease are
      lacking. OBJECTIVE: To identify imaging features of the terminal ileum on
      short-interval bowel ultrasound (US) and MR enterography (MRE) in children with
      Crohn disease requiring surgical bowel resection and those managed by medical
      therapy alone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study evaluated patients
      18 years and younger with Crohn disease undergoing short-interval bowel US and
      MRE (within 2 months of one another), as well as subsequent ileocecectomy or
      endoscopy within 3 months of imaging. Appearance of the terminal ileum on both
      modalities was compared between surgical patients and those managed with medical 
      therapy, with the following parameters assessed: bowel wall thickness, mural
      stratification, vascularity, fibrofatty proliferation, abscess, fistula and
      stricture on bowel US; bowel wall thickness, T2 ratio, enhancement pattern,
      mesenteric edema, fibrofatty proliferation, abscess, fistula and stricture on
      MRE. A two-sided t-test was used to compare means, a Mann-Whitney U analysis was 
      used for non-parametric parameter scores, and a chi-square or two-sided Fisher
      exact test compared categorical variables. Imaging findings in surgical patients 
      were correlated with location-matched histopathological scores of inflammation
      and fibrosis using a scoring system adapted from the Simple Endoscopic Score for 
      Crohn Disease, and a Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to compare
      inflammation and fibrosis on histopathology. RESULTS: Twenty-two surgical
      patients (mean age: 16.5 years; male/female: 13/9) and 20 nonsurgical patients
      (mean age: 14.8; M/F: 8/12) were included in the final analysis. On US, the
      surgical group demonstrated significantly increased mean bowel wall thickness
      (6.1 mm vs. 4.7 mm for the nonsurgical group; P = 0.01), loss of mural
      stratification (odds ratio [OR] = 6.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.4-28.4; P 
      = 0.02) and increased fibrofatty proliferation (P = 0.04). On MRE, the surgical
      group showed increased mean bowel wall thickness (9.1 mm vs. 7.2 mm for the
      nonsurgical group; P = 0.02), increased mean T2 ratio (4.6 vs. 3.6 for the
      nonsurgical group; P = 0.03), different enhancement patterns (P = 0.03),
      increased mesenteric edema (P = 0.001) and increased stricture formation (OR =
      8.2; 95% CI: 1.8-36.4; P = 0.005). Nineteen of 22 ileocecectomy specimens showed 
      severe inflammation and 21/22 showed severe fibrosis, with significant
      correlation between inflammation and fibrosis scores (rho = 0.55; P = 0.008);
      however, correlation with imaging findings was limited by the uniformity of
      findings on histopathology. CONCLUSION: Children with terminal ileal Crohn
      disease requiring surgical bowel resection demonstrate more severe manifestations
      of imaging features traditionally associated with both active inflammation and
      chronic fibrosis than those managed medically on US and MRE, findings that are
      corroborated by histopathology. These features may potentially serve as imaging
      biomarkers indicating the necessity for surgical intervention.

TI  - Preventive health measures in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 7625-44
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i34.7625 [doi]
AB  - We aim to review the literature and provide guidance on preventive health
      measures in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Structured searches were performed 
      in PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Library from January 1976
      to June 2016 using the following keywords: (inflammatory bowel disease OR Crohn's
      disease OR ulcerative colitis) AND (health maintenance OR preventive health OR
      health promotion). Abstracts of the articles selected from each of these multiple
      searches were reviewed, and those meeting the inclusion criteria (that is,
      providing data regarding preventive health or health maintenance in IBD patients)
      were recorded. Reference lists from the selected articles were manually reviewed 
      to identify further relevant studies. Patients with IBD are at increased risk of 
      developing adverse events related to the disease course, therapeutic
      interventions, or non-adherence to medication. Recent studies have suggested that
      IBD patients do not receive preventive services with the same thoroughness as
      patients with other chronic diseases. Preventive health measures can avert
      morbidity and improve the quality of life of patients with IBD.
      Gastroenterologists and primary care physicians (PCPs) should have an up to date 
      working knowledge of preventive health measures for IBD patients. A holistic
      approach and better communication between gastroenterologists and PCPs with
      explicit clarification of roles will prevent duplication of services and
      streamline care.

TI  - Bone status assessed by quantitative ultrasound in children with inflammatory
      bowel disease: a comparison with DXA.
PG  - 1305-1312
AB  - BACKGROUND: To determine the bone status in children with inflammatory bowel
      diseases (IBD) using quantitative ultrasound (QUS) measurement at hand phalanges 
      and compare the obtained results with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).
      METHODS: Fifty-one children with IBD underwent DXA and QUS measurements at hand
      phalanges in the year 2013. The control group for the QUS consisted of 460
      children. Reference data for DXA comes from Hologic Explorer. RESULTS: QUS
      measurements did not differ significantly between IBD patients and healthy
      controls. There was no difference between UC and CD subjects. DXA measurements in
      patients with IBD were lower than in the healthy population. Tanner stage and
      nutritional status correlated with bone status contrary to steroids therapy.
      CONCLUSION: Low bone mineral density often complicates IBD in children. QUS is
      not an appropriate method for the assessment of bone status in children.
      Nutritional status seems to have a greater impact on bone status than
      corticosteroids therapy.

TI  - Anemia and iron deficiency in gastrointestinal and liver conditions.
PG  - 7908-25
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v22.i35.7908 [doi]
AB  - Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is associated with a number of pathological
      gastrointestinal conditions other than inflammatory bowel disease, and also with 
      liver disorders. Different factors such as chronic bleeding, malabsorption and
      inflammation may contribute to IDA. Although patients with symptoms of anemia are
      frequently referred to gastroenterologists, the approach to diagnosis and
      selection of treatment as well as follow-up measures is not standardized and
      suboptimal. Iron deficiency, even without anemia, can substantially impact
      physical and cognitive function and reduce quality of life. Therefore, regular
      iron status assessment and awareness of the clinical consequences of impaired
      iron status are critical. While the range of options for treatment of IDA is
      increasing due to the availability of effective and well-tolerated parenteral
      iron preparations, a comprehensive overview of IDA and its therapy in patients
      with gastrointestinal conditions is currently lacking. Furthermore, definitions
      and assessment of iron status lack harmonization and there is a paucity of expert
      guidelines on this topic. This review summarizes current thinking concerning IDA 
      as a common co-morbidity in specific gastrointestinal and liver disorders, and
      thus encourages a more unified treatment approach to anemia and iron deficiency, 
      while offering gastroenterologists guidance on treatment options for IDA in
      everyday clinical practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pediatric-onset Crohn's disease (CD) is a heterogeneous disorder
      which is subjected to progression and complications in a substantial proportion
      of patients. AIMS: We aimed to assess the progression in pediatric-onset CD
      phenotype on long term follow up. METHODS: Medical charts of pediatric onset CD
      patients with at least 10 years follow-up were analyzed retrospectively. Disease 
      phenotype was determined at diagnosis and during follow up at different time
      points. Phenotype was determined according to the Paris classification. The
      impact of possible predictors on phenotype progression was assessed as well as
      the association between different therapeutic regimens during disease course and 
      phenotype progression. RESULTS: Progression of disease location, behavior, and
      perianal involvement was observed in 20%, 38% and 20% of patients, respectively, 
      after a median follow-up of 16.4 (+/-4.4) years. Microscopic ileocolonic disease 
      at diagnosis was significant predictors for progression of disease extent.
      Treatment with anti tumor necrosis factor-a agents and number of flares per years
      of follow-up were associated with progression of disease extent, behavior and
      perianal involvement. CONCLUSION: Disease extent, behavior and prevalence of
      perianal disease change significantly over time in pediatric-onset CD. In our
      cohort, most clinical, laboratory and endoscopic parameters do not serve as
      predictors for long-term disease progression.

AB  - Approximately 70% of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) undergo surgical
      resection for the treatment of medically refractory disease or its complications.
      The sickest cohort of CD patients experience rapid postoperative relapse at the
      anastomotic site. Over the past 2 decades, the types of surgical anastomoses used
      in CD reconstruction have changed; end-to-side and end-to-end anastomoses have
      been surpassed by the more rapidly created side-to-side anastomoses. This article
      provides a review of the timing and purpose of endoscopic evaluation in
      postoperative CD patients and pragmatic information regarding interpretation of
      endoscopic findings at the different types of surgical anastomoses after
      ileocecal resection.

TI  - Vedolizumab Therapy in Severe Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
PG  - 2425-31
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000918 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vedolizumab is effective for inducing and maintaining remission in
      adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, there is limited pediatric
      data. This study aimed to describe the adverse events and clinical response to
      vedolizumab in refractory pediatric IBD. METHODS: Disease activity indices,
      clinical response, concomitant medication use, and adverse events were measured
      over 22 weeks in an observational prospective cohort study of children with
      refractory IBD who had failed anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy and subsequently
      initiated vedolizumab therapy. RESULTS: Twenty-one subjects, 16 with Crohn
      disease, received vedolizumab. Clinical response was observed in 6/19 (31.6%) of 
      the evaluable subjects at week 6 and in 11/19 (57.9%) by week 22. Before
      induction, 15/21 (71.4%) participants were treated with systemic corticosteroids,
      as compared with 7/21 (33.3%) subjects at 22 weeks. Steroid-free remission was
      seen in 1/20 (5.0%) subjects at 6 weeks, 3/20 (15.0%) at 14 weeks, and 4/20
      (20.0%) at 22 weeks. There was statistically significant improvement in serum
      albumin and hematocrit; however, C-reactive protein increased by week 22 (P <
      0.05). There were no infusion reactions. Vedolizumab was discontinued in 2
      patients because of severe colitis, requiring surgical intervention. CONCLUSIONS:
      There is limited experience with vedolizumab therapy in pediatric IBD. There
      seems to be a marked number of subjects with clinical response in the first 6
      weeks that increases further by week 22 despite the severity of disease in this
      cohort. Adverse events may not be directly related to vedolizumab. This study is 
      limited by small sample size, and larger prospective studies are warranted.

TI  - Northern Latitude but Not Season Is Associated with Increased Rates of
      Hospitalizations Related to Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Results of a Multi-Year
      Analysis of a National Cohort.
PG  - e0161523
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0161523 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There is growing evidence that the incidence and severity of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may be geographically and seasonally related.
      Why these associations are observed remains unclear. We assessed the impact of
      geographic location, season, and exposure to ultraviolet light on disease
      severity by measuring national hospital IBD-related discharge rates. METHODS:
      Utilizing the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), we identified all patients with 
      IBD-related discharges from 2001-2007. Patients were included if they were
      discharged from states above the 40th parallel (north) or at or below the 35th
      parallel (south); and their discharge fell within the winter (January, February, 
      and March) or summer (July, August, and September). Groups of patients were
      assessed comparing north to south within each season, and summer to winter within
      each region. UV index was recorded from the National Weather Service data and
      compared to monthly discharge rates. RESULTS: There was a consistent pattern of
      increased IBD-related hospitalization rates in northern states compared to
      southern states for both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Differences in
      IBD-related hospitalization rates by season, however, were not uniform across the
      years studied. UV index was significantly inversely associated although not
      proportional to discharge rates for both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In the US, there is a significant increased rate of IBD-related
      hospitalizations in the northern compared to southern states, which not fully
      explained by differences in UV exposure.

AB  - UNLABELLED: In adult inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, there is a strong
      discrepancy between symptoms and biomarkers of inflammation. Data on pediatric
      IBD patients are conflicting. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the relationship
      between clinical symptoms and biomarkers of inflammation in pediatric IBD.
      Patients aged <18 years with previously diagnosed Crohn's disease (CD) or
      ulcerative colitis (UC) were included. Clinical disease activity was determined
      using the abbreviated Pediatric CD Activity Index (aPCDAI) or Pediatric UC
      Activity Index (PUCAI). Biochemical disease activity was assessed using fecal
      calprotectin (FC) and C-reactive protein (CRP). In total, 127 patients (62 male; 
      median age 14.9 years) were included (82 CD, 45 UC). FC correlated weakly with
      total aPCDAI score (r s = 0.32; 95 % CI 0.12-0.51; p = 0.003) and total PUCAI
      score (r s = 0.36; 95 % CI 0.07-0.62; p = 0.015). Only aPCDAI components
      abdominal examination and perirectal disease and PUCAI component activity level
      had a significant correlation with levels of FC. CRP correlated weakly with total
      aPCDAI score (r s = 0.28; 95 % CI 0.05-0.46; p = 0.012) and aPCDAI components
      abdominal examination and activity level. No significant correlation was observed
      between CRP and total PUCAI score (r s = 0.01; 95 % CI -0.34-0.29; p = 0.961) or 
      individual PUCAI components. CONCLUSION: There is a strong discrepancy between
      clinical symptoms and biomarkers of inflammation in children with IBD. WHAT IS
      KNOWN: * A substantial proportion of asymptomatic pediatric inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) patients have elevated biomarkers of inflammation. * There is a
      strong discrepancy between symptoms and biomarkers of inflammation in adults with
      IBD. What is New: * Clinical symptoms are only weakly associated with levels of
      fecal calprotectin and serum C-reactive protein in children and adolescents with 
      previously diagnosed IBD. * Similarly to adult IBD patients, there is a strong
      discrepancy between clinical symptoms and biomarkers of inflammation in children 
      with IBD.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic pathology that has an outbreaks
      course that in recent years have seen an increase in incidence, especially at
      younger ages. Malnutrition is frequently associated with this condition,
      therefore, it is very important to ensure a right nutritional intervention,
      especially in pediatric patients, to ensure an optimal growth and also an
      improvement in the clinic. Our goal will be updated the role of nutrition in this
      disease and in its treatment based on the published evidence. Malnutrition in
      these patients is frequent and is influenced by various factors such as,
      decreased food intake, increased nutrient requirements, increased protein loss
      and malabsorption of nutrients. Therefore there should be a nutritional
      monitoring of all of them, in which anthropometric measurements, laboratory tests
      and densitometry were made to establish the needs and sufficient caloric intake
      tailored to each patient. The use of enteral nutrition as a treatment in Crohn's 
      disease with mild to moderate outbreak in child population, is amply
      demonstrated, has even shown to be superior to the use of corticosteroids.
      Therefore we can conclude by stressing that nutritional intervention is a
      mainstay in the management of patients with IBD, which aims to prevent and / or
      control disease-related malnutrition to decrease morbidity and mortality and
      improve quality of life.

TI  - Prognostic Nutritional Index Predicts Short-Term Postoperative Outcomes After
      Bowel Resection for Crohn's Disease.
PG  - 92-97
LID - 10.1177/0884533616661844 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bowel resection is required in the majority of patients with Crohn's 
      disease (CD) during their lifetime. The Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI) is a
      useful tool for predicting postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing cancer
      surgery. We examined the ability of the PNI to predict short-term outcomes in
      patients with CD-related bowel resection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-three
      patients who underwent bowel resection for CD were retrospectively enrolled in
      the study. The PNI was calculated as follows: 10 x serum albumin (g/dL) + 0.005 x
      total lymphocyte count (per mL). Patients were divided into 2 groups: PNI <40 (n 
      = 30) and PNI >/=40 (n = 43). RESULTS: A significant difference was found in body
      mass index (17.9 +/- 2.4 vs 19.2 +/- 2.2, P = .018) between the 2 groups.
      Postoperative overall and infectious complications occurred more frequently in
      patients with PNI <40 than in those with PNI >/=40 (50.0% and 46.7% vs 23.3% and 
      16.3%, P = .018 and P = .005, respectively). In the univariate analysis, body
      mass index <18.5, penetrating behavior, open surgery, and PNI <40 were associated
      with an increased risk of overall complications and infectious complications. In 
      the multivariate analysis, only PNI <40 was an independent prognostic factor for 
      infectious complications (odds ratio: 3.846, 95% confidence interval:
      1.145-12.821). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative PNI is a useful predictor of
      postoperative infectious complications in patients with CD-related bowel
      resection.

TI  - Mucosal MicroRNAs Expression Profiles before and after Exclusive Enteral
      Nutrition Therapy in Adult Patients with Crohn's Disease.
LID - 10.3390/nu8080519 [doi]
LID - E519 [pii]
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to be important for the pathogenesis of
      Crohn's disease (CD). Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is an effective therapy
      for inducing remission in CD. We aimed to investigate the alteration of miRNAs
      expression profile in the terminal ileal mucosa of CD patients before and after
      EEN. Twenty-five patients and ten healthy individuals were included. MiRNAs
      expression profile was firstly assessed using microarray technology and then
      validation was performed by qRT-PCR. The correlations between miRNAs and CD
      activity index (CDAI) score and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level were also
      evaluated. Microarray analysis showed that mucosal miRNAs expression profile
      after EEN therapy was significantly changed compared with inflamed mucosa before 
      treatment, and was most similar to the healthy one among all CD groups. Altered
      expressions of hsa-miR-192-5p, hsa-miR-423-3p, hsa-miR-99a-5p, hsa-miR-124-3p,
      hsa-miR-301a-5p, hsa-miR-495-5p, and hsa-let-7b-5p were confirmed by qRT-PCR.
      hsa-let-7b-5p was significantly correlated with serum CRP levels before and after
      EEN treatment (r = -0.518, p = 0.008, and r = -0.569, p = 0.003). Our study
      showed EEN induction therapy was associated with a trend for normalizing of the
      mucosal miRNAs expression profile, and expression of mucosal hsa-let-7b-5p was
      correlated with serum CRP level in patients with CD.

TI  - Preoperative oral polymeric diet enriched with transforming growth factor-beta 2 
      (Modulen) could decrease postoperative morbidity after surgery for complicated
      ileocolonic Crohn's disease.
PG  - 5-10
LID - 10.1080/00365521.2016.1221994 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Exclusive polymeric diet enriched with transforming growth factor-beta
      2 (ANS-TGF-beta2) has been used for remission induction and maintenance in
      pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). Its use in the preoperative setting has never
      been evaluated. The aim of this study was to evaluate preoperative ANS-TGF-beta2 
      to decrease postoperative complications after surgery for complicated ileocolonic
      CD. METHODS: From 2011 to 2015, data of all consecutive patients who underwent
      elective surgery for ileocolonic CD were collected prospectively. Preoperative,
      exclusive ANS-TGF-beta2 was administered in high-risk patients with complicated
      CD. Complicated CD was defined by the presence of obstructive symptoms, and/or
      steroid treatment, and/or preoperative weight loss >10% and/or perforating CD.
      Outcomes of high-risk patients receiving preoperative ANS-TGF-beta2 were compared
      to those of low-risk patients with no complicated CD who underwent upfront
      surgery. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients underwent surgery for ileocolonic CD. Among 
      them, 35 high-risk patients received preoperative ANS-TGF-beta2 and 21 low-risk
      patients underwent upfront surgery. Preoperative full-dose ANS-TGF-beta2 was
      feasible in 34/35 high-risk patients. Discontinuation of steroids during
      preoperative ANS-TGF-beta2 could be achieved in 10/16 patients (62.5%).
      Postoperative complications rates were 8/35 (23.8%) and 5/21 (22.9%) in high-risk
      and low-risk patients, respectively (p = 1). Temporary ileocolostomy rates in
      high-risk patients and in low-risk patients were 4/35 (11%) and 0/21,
      respectively (p = 0.286) Conclusion: Preoperative ANS-TGF-beta2 is feasible in
      most high-risk patients with complicated ileocolonic CD and could limit the
      deleterious effects of risk factors of postoperative morbidity. These results
      need to be confirmed in a large randomized controlled trial.

TI  - Inflammation-driven malnutrition: a new screening tool predicts outcome in
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1061-7
LID - 10.1017/S0007114516003044 [doi]
AB  - Malnutrition is a frequent feature in Crohn's disease (CD), affects patient
      outcome and must be recognised. For chronic inflammatory diseases, recent
      guidelines recommend the development of combined malnutrition and inflammation
      risk scores. We aimed to design and evaluate a new screening tool that combines
      both malnutrition and inflammation parameters that might help predict clinical
      outcome. In a prospective cohort study, we examined fifty-five patients with CD
      in remission (Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) <200) at 0 and 6 months. We
      assessed disease activity (CDAI, Harvey-Bradshaw index), inflammation (C-reactive
      protein (CRP), faecal calprotectin (FC)), malnutrition (BMI, subjective global
      assessment (SGA), serum albumin, handgrip strength), body composition
      (bioelectrical impedance analysis) and administered the newly developed
      'Malnutrition Inflammation Risk Tool' (MIRT; containing BMI, unintentional weight
      loss over 3 months and CRP). All parameters were evaluated regarding their
      ability to predict disease outcome prospectively at 6 months. At baseline, more
      than one-third of patients showed elevated inflammatory markers despite clinical 
      remission (36.4 % CRP >/=5 mg/l, 41.5 % FC >/=100 microg/g). Prevalence of
      malnutrition at baseline according to BMI, SGA and serum albumin was 2-16 %. At 6
      months, MIRT significantly predicted outcome in numerous nutritional and clinical
      parameters (SGA, CD-related flares, hospitalisations and surgeries). In contrast,
      SGA, handgrip strength, BMI, albumin and body composition had no influence on the
      clinical course. The newly developed MIRT was found to reliably predict clinical 
      outcome in CD patients. This screening tool might be used to facilitate clinical 
      decision making, including treatment of both inflammation and malnutrition in
      order to prevent complications.

      Bowel Disease.
PG  - 2121-6
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000865 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Though vedolizumab has received regulatory approval for the treatment
      of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) in adults, there is
      increasing off-label use in children. AIMS: To describe the experience with
      vedolizumab in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients at 3 tertiary 
      IBD centers and examine predictors of remission. METHODS: A retrospective review 
      identified pediatric IBD patients (age < 18 yrs) receiving vedolizumab. Data on
      demographics, disease behavior, location, activity, and previous
      treatments/surgeries were collected. Disease activity was assessed using the
      weighted pediatric CD activity index or pediatric UC activity index. Primary
      outcome was week 14 remission, defined as pediatric UC activity index <10 or
      weighted pediatric CD activity index <12.5. Descriptive statistics and univariate
      analyses were performed to examine associations of clinical characteristics with 
      efficacy. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients, 58% CD and 42% UC, initiated vedolizumab
      between June 2014 and August 2015. Median age at vedolizumab initiation was 14.9 
      (range 7-17) years. Ninety percent had failed >/=1 anti-tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF) agent. Week 14 remission rates for UC and CD were 76% and 42%, respectively
      (P < 0.05). Eighty percent of anti-TNF-naive patients experienced week 14
      remission. At week 22, anti-TNF-naive patients had higher remission rates than
      TNF-exposed patients (100% versus 45%, P = 0.04). There were no infusion
      reactions or serious adverse events/infections. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest 
      that vedolizumab is efficacious and safe in pediatric IBD patients, with UC
      patients experiencing earlier and higher rates of remission than CD patients.
      Anti-TNF-naive patients experienced higher remission rates than those with
      anti-TNF exposure. Controlled clinical trial data are needed to confirm these
      observations.

TI  - Identification of Variants in Genes Associated with Single-gene Inflammatory
      Bowel Disease by Whole-exome Sequencing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Most cases of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are caused by complex 
      host-environment interaction. There are a number of conditions associated with a 
      single-gene mutation, most cases are very early onset (aged < 6 yr), present with
      a unique form of disease and often have atypical features. METHODS: Whole-exome
      data for 147 pediatric patients with IBD were interrogated for a panel of 51
      genes associated with monogenic IBD. Observed variation was categorized according
      to the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) guidelines to identify rare,
      novel, and known variants that might contribute to IBD. RESULTS: Five hundred
      seventy-four variants were identified across 51 genes. These were categorized in 
      line with ACMG guidance to remove benign variants and to identify "pathogenic"
      and "likely pathogenic" variants. In 6 patients, we observed 6 pathogenic
      variants of which CYBA(c.287+2T>C), COL7A1(c.6501+1G>C), LIG4(p.R814X), and
      XIAP(p.T470S) were known causative mutations, and FERMT1(p.R271Q) and
      SKIV2L(c.354+5G>A) were novel. In the 3 patients with XIAP, SKIV2L, and FERMT1
      variants, individuals' disease features resembled the monogenic phenotype. This
      was despite apparent heterozygous carriage of pathogenic variation for the latter
      2 genes. The XIAP variant was observed in a hemizygous male. CONCLUSIONS:
      Whole-exome sequencing allows for identification of known and de novo potentially
      causative mutations in genes associated with monogenic IBD. Although these are
      rare conditions, it is vital to identify causative mutations early to improve
      prognosis. We postulate that in a subset of IBD, heterozygous mutations (in genes
      believed to manifest IBD through autosomal recessive inheritance) may contribute 
      to clinical presentation.

TI  - Urinary Metabolic Phenotyping Reveals Differences in the Metabolic Status of
      Healthy and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Children in Relation to Growth and
      Disease Activity.
LID - 10.3390/ijms17081310 [doi]
LID - E1310 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Growth failure and delayed puberty are well known features of
      children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), in addition to
      the chronic course of the disease. Urinary metabonomics was applied in order to
      better understand metabolic changes between healthy and IBD children. METHODS: 21
      Pediatric patients with IBD (mean age 14.8 years, 8 males) were enrolled from the
      Pediatric Gastroenterology Outpatient Clinic over two years. Clinical and
      biological data were collected at baseline, 6, and 12 months. 27 healthy children
      (mean age 12.9 years, 16 males) were assessed at baseline. Urine samples were
      collected at each visit and subjected to (1)H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
      spectroscopy. RESULTS: Using (1)H NMR metabonomics, we determined that urine
      metabolic profiles of IBD children differ significantly from healthy controls.
      Metabolic differences include central energy metabolism, amino acid, and gut
      microbial metabolic pathways. The analysis described that combined urinary urea
      and phenylacetylglutamine-two readouts of nitrogen metabolism-may be relevant to 
      monitor metabolic status in the course of disease. CONCLUSION: Non-invasive
      sampling of urine followed by metabonomic profiling can elucidate and monitor the
      metabolic status of children in relation to disease status. Further developments 
      of omic-approaches in pediatric research might deliver novel nutritional and
      metabolic hypotheses.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Genome-wide association studies have identified 200
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) loci, but the genetic architecture of Crohn's
      disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis remain incompletely defined. Here, we aimed
      to identify novel associations between IBD and functional genetic variants using 
      the Illumina ExomeChip (San Diego, CA). METHODS: Genotyping was performed in
      10,523 IBD cases and 5726 non-IBD controls. There were 91,713 functional
      single-nucleotide polymorphism loci in coding regions analyzed. A novel
      identified association was replicated further in 2 independent cohorts. We
      further examined the association of the identified single-nucleotide polymorphism
      with microbiota from 338 mucosal lavage samples in the Mucosal Luminal Interface 
      cohort measured using 16S sequencing. RESULTS: We identified an association
      between CD and a missense variant encoding alanine or threonine at position 391
      in the zinc transporter solute carrier family 39, member 8 protein (SLC39A8
      alanine 391 threonine, rs13107325) and replicated the association with CD in 2
      replication cohorts (combined meta-analysis P = 5.55 x 10(-13)). This variant has
      been associated previously with distinct phenotypes including obesity, lipid
      levels, blood pressure, and schizophrenia. We subsequently determined that the CD
      risk allele was associated with altered colonic mucosal microbiome composition in
      both healthy controls (P = .009) and CD cases (P = .0009). Moreover, microbes
      depleted in healthy carriers strongly overlap with those reduced in CD patients
      (P = 9.24 x 10(-16)) and overweight individuals (P = 6.73 x 10(-16)).
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that an SLC39A8-dependent shift in the gut
      microbiome could explain its pleiotropic effects on multiple complex diseases
      including CD.

AB  - Single-nucleotide variations in C13orf31 (LACC1) that encode p.C284R and p.I254V 
      in a protein of unknown function (called 'FAMIN' here) are associated with
      increased risk for systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, leprosy and Crohn's
      disease. Here we set out to identify the biological mechanism affected by these
      coding variations. FAMIN formed a complex with fatty acid synthase (FASN) on
      peroxisomes and promoted flux through de novo lipogenesis to concomitantly drive 
      high levels of fatty-acid oxidation (FAO) and glycolysis and, consequently, ATP
      regeneration. FAMIN-dependent FAO controlled inflammasome activation,
      mitochondrial and NADPH-oxidase-dependent production of reactive oxygen species
      (ROS), and the bactericidal activity of macrophages. As p.I254V and p.C284R
      resulted in diminished function and loss of function, respectively, FAMIN
      determined resilience to endotoxin shock. Thus, we have identified a central
      regulator of the metabolic function and bioenergetic state of macrophages that is
      under evolutionary selection and determines the risk of inflammatory and
      infectious disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Soluble tumour necrosis factor-alpha (sTNF-alpha) has been reported
      to increase in the course of anti-TNF-alpha therapy for rheumatoid and skin
      diseases. AIMS: To assess changes in sTNF-alpha and clinical efficacy of
      anti-TNF-alpha agents in Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: Sixty-four patients on
      infliximab or adalimumab were analyzed. Clinical outcomes were assessed by using 
      CD Activity Index after the induction therapy and at week 52. sTNF-alpha was
      measured before and after the induction therapy with high-sensitivity
      immunoassay. RESULTS: In the majority of patients, sTNF-alpha increased
      significantly. Those with the greatest increase were more likely to experience
      long-term response, were more often treated with infliximab, had less frequently 
      isolated small bowel CD, and tended to have sTNF-alpha levels at baseline that
      correlated with C-reactive protein. CONCLUSIONS: Neutralization of sTNF-alpha
      does not seem to be critical for the efficacy of anti-TNF-alpha therapy in CD.
      Paradoxically - an increase in sTNF-alpha may reflect an ongoing process that is 
      beneficial for the clinical outcome.

TI  - Factors affecting poor nutritional status after small bowel resection in patients
      with Crohn disease.
PG  - e4285
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000004285 [doi]
AB  - In Crohn disease, bowel-preserving surgery is necessary to prevent short bowel
      syndrome due to repeated operations. This study aimed to determine the remnant
      small bowel length cut-off and to evaluate the clinical factors related to
      nutritional status after small bowel resection in Crohn disease.We included 394
      patients (69.3% male) who underwent small bowel resection for Crohn disease
      between 1991 and 2012. Patients who were classified as underweight (body mass
      index < 17.5) or at high risk of nutrition-related problems (modified nutritional
      risk index < 83.5) were regarded as having a poor nutritional status. Preliminary
      remnant small bowel length cut-offs were determined using receiver operating
      characteristic curves. Variables associated with poor nutritional status were
      assessed retrospectively using Student t tests, chi-squared tests, Fisher exact
      tests, and logistic regression analyses.The mean follow-up period was 52.9 months
      and the mean patient ages at the time of the last bowel surgery and last
      follow-up were 31.2 and 35.7 years, respectively. The mean remnant small bowel
      length was 331.8 cm. Forty-three patients (10.9%) underwent ileostomy, 309
      (78.4%) underwent combined small bowel and colon resection, 111 (28.2%) had
      currently active disease, and 105 (26.6%) underwent at least 2 operations for
      recurrent disease. The mean body mass index and modified nutritional risk index
      were 20.6 and 100.8, respectively. The independent factors affecting underweight 
      status were remnant small bowel length </=240 cm (odds ratio: 4.84, P < 0.001),
      ileostomy (odds ratio: 4.70, P < 0.001), and currently active disease (odds
      ratio: 4.16, P < 0.001). The independent factors affecting high nutritional risk 
      were remnant small bowel length </=230 cm (odds ratio: 2.84, P = 0.012), presence
      of ileostomy (odds ratio: 3.36, P = 0.025), and currently active disease (odds
      ratio: 4.90, P < 0.001).Currently active disease, ileostomy, and remnant small
      bowel length </=230 cm are risk factors affecting the poor nutritional status of 
      patients with Crohn disease after small bowel resection.

TI  - Safety of Long-term Treatment With Certolizumab Pegol in Patients With Crohn's
      Disease, Based on a Pooled Analysis of Data From Clinical Trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Treatments for Crohn's disease (CD) have been linked to
      serious infections, malignancies, and dermatologic complications. We pooled and
      analyzed clinical trials of certolizumab pegol, a pegylated humanized Fab'
      fragment against tumor necrosis factor, to quantify safety events in patients
      with CD. METHODS: We collected data from 5 placebo-controlled trials, 9
      open-label studies, and 1 dose-regimen study, conducted globally through April
      2014. A total of 2570 patients with moderate to severe CD were treated with
      certolizumab pegol, with 4378.1 patient-years of exposure. Data were analyzed in 
      2 groups: patients from placebo-controlled (PC) trials treated with placebo (n = 
      875) or certolizumab pegol (n = 919) for 6 to 38 weeks (the PC group) or all
      patients exposed to certolizumab pegol (n = 2570), for durations of 6 to 362
      weeks (the all-studies group). Incidence rates (IRs; incidence/100 patient-years)
      of adverse events (AEs) were calculated from first dose through 70 days
      (approximately 5 half-lives) after the last dose. RESULTS: In the PC group, IRs
      for serious AEs were similar among patients given certolizumab pegol (31.35/100
      patient-years) vs placebo (24.33/100 patient-years). IRs of serious infections or
      malignancies were low among patients receiving short-term treatment with
      certolizumab pegol (8.49/100 patient-years and 1.01/100 patient-years,
      respectively, in the PC group) and did not increase with long-term treatment
      (6.47/100 patient-years and 0.80/100 patient-years, respectively, in the
      all-studies group). IRs of psoriasis or psoriasiform dermatitis were low in the
      PC group (1.01/100 patient-years and 0/100 patient-years, respectively); in the
      placebo group, these IRs were 0.38 per 100 patient-years and 0 per 100
      patient-years, respectively. IRs of psoriasis or psoriasiform dermatitis did not 
      increase with long-term treatment (0.93/100 patient-years and 0.09/100
      patient-years, respectively, in the all-studies group). CONCLUSIONS: Based on an 
      analysis of data pooled from 15 trials of patients with CD, the safety profile
      for long-term therapy with certolizumab pegol therapy is similar to that reported
      from short-term studies. Overall rates of AEs, serious infections, malignancies, 
      and psoriasis did not increase with long-term treatment, suggesting a favorable
      risk-benefit ratio with long-term certolizumab pegol therapy in CD.

TI  - Fecal microbiota transplantation in inflammatory bowel disease: the quest for the
      holy grail.
PG  - 1360-1365
LID - 10.1038/mi.2016.67 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is due to an aberrant immune response toward
      luminal antigens, probably commensal bacteria, in genetically susceptible
      subjects and is also influenced by environmental factors. An imbalanced
      intestinal microbiota known as "dysbiosis," characterized by an increased
      proportion of pro-inflammatory microorganisms and a decreased proportion of
      anti-inflammatory microorganisms, has been repeatedly observed in IBD and is now 
      recognized as a key factor in the gut inflammatory process. Fecal microbiota
      transplantation (FMT) has gained interest as a novel treatment option in IBD. The
      goal of FMT in IBD is not only to correct the dysbiosis, but also to restore a
      normal dialog between the host immune system and the microbiota. Data are still
      scarce, but the results of the first studies suggest that FMT could be a
      promising therapy in IBD. More studies are needed to define the best indications,
      optimal timing, frequency, mode of delivery, and the optimal donor for each
      patient.

TI  - Exposure to Ambient Air Pollution and the Risk of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A
      European Nested Case-Control Study.
PG  - 2963-2971
LID - 10.1007/s10620-016-4249-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Industrialization has been linked to the etiology of inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD). AIM: We investigated the association between air pollution
      exposure and IBD. METHODS: The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and
      Nutrition cohort was used to identify cases with Crohn's disease (CD) (n = 38)
      and ulcerative colitis (UC) (n = 104) and controls (n = 568) from Denmark,
      France, the Netherlands, and the UK, matched for center, gender, age, and date of
      recruitment. Air pollution data were obtained from the European Study of Cohorts 
      for Air Pollution Effects. Residential exposure was assessed with land-use
      regression models for particulate matter with diameters of <10 mum (PM10), <2.5
      mum (PM2.5), and between 2.5 and 10 mum (PMcoarse), soot (PM2.5 absorbance),
      nitrogen oxides, and two traffic indicators. Conditional logistic regression
      analyses were performed to calculate odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % confidence
      intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Although air pollution was not significantly associated
      with CD or UC separately, the associations were mostly similar. Individuals with 
      IBD were less likely to have higher exposure levels of PM2.5 and PM10, with ORs
      of 0.24 (95 % CI 0.07-0.81) per 5 mug/m(3) and 0.25 (95 % CI 0.08-0.78) per 10
      mug/m(3), respectively. There was an inverse but nonsignificant association for
      PMcoarse. A higher nearby traffic load was positively associated with IBD [OR
      1.60 (95 % CI 1.04-2.46) per 4,000,000 motor vehicles x m per day]. Other air
      pollutants were positively but not significantly associated with IBD. CONCLUSION:
      Exposure to air pollution was not found to be consistently associated with IBD.

TI  - Patients with inflammatory bowel disease and their treating clinicians have
      different views regarding diet.
PG  - 66-72
LID - 10.1111/jhn.12400 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diet and body composition play unclear roles in the pathogenesis,
      activity and symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Evidence-based
      guidance regarding dietary modification in IBD is lacking. We aimed to determine 
      the attitudes of IBD patients and clinicians to diet. METHODS: The present
      cross-sectional study comprised an online questionnaire distributed to members of
      a national IBD patient organisation, assessing demographics, anthropometry,
      disease phenotype and dietary beliefs. Dietitians, gastroenterologists and
      surgeons were targeted for a similar questionnaire as a result of membership of
      national professional bodies. RESULTS: Nine hundred and twenty-eight patients
      (72.2% female; mean age 39.5 years; age range 5-91 years) responded. Two-thirds
      of the patients had Crohn's disease. The mean reported body mass index was 24.9
      kg m(-2) and was significantly skewed to the right. Patients who had taken >10
      courses of steroids were had a greater probability of being overweight or obese, 
      independent of disease complications. Most patients (71%) assumed that their diet
      affected their IBD; 61% considered their IBD specialist disregarded the
      importance of diet. Of the 136 clinicians who responded, the majority felt that
      diet was a factor in symptoms and intestinal microbiota. More gastroenterologists
      (44%) than dietitians (17%) considered that diet had a role in the pathogenesis
      of IBD (P = 0.003). Twenty-six percent of patients reported receiving dietary
      advice from their IBD specialist, whereas 98% of gastroenterologists reported
      advice provision. Patients received diverse advice. Half of the patients followed
      recommendations provided by a clinician. CONCLUSIONS: The present study
      demonstrates that IBD patients consider diet to be important in their disease.
      IBD clinicians from different disciplines have diverse views of the role of diet.
      Advice given to patients is heterogeneous, often perceived as inadequate and
      poorly followed.

TI  - Handgrip Strength Index Predicts Nutritional Status as a Complement to Body Mass 
      Index in Crohn's Disease.
PG  - 1395-1400
AB  - BACKGROUND: Body mass index [BMI] is widely used to measure nutritional status in
      Crohn's disease [CD] patients, but limitations remain. Measuring handgrip
      strength index, in addition to BMI, may aid in overcoming limitations. METHODS: A
      total of 150 patients with CD and 254 controls were included in this study. All
      patients and controls underwent BMI, handgrip strength and bioelectrical
      impedance analysis. Bioelectrical impedance analysis included body cell mass,
      bone mineral content, skeletal muscle mass and body fat mass. A total of 88 CD
      patients were age-, sex- and BMI-matched with healthy controls for further
      analysis. RESULTS: BMI, body cell mass, body cell mass index, handgrip strength
      and handgrip strength index were all significantly decreased in the group of CD
      patients compared with controls [p < 0.0001]. When paired by BMI, healthy
      controls had significantly increased body cell mass index[p = 0.0344] and
      handgrip strength index [p = 0.0010] compared to patients. In addition, handgrip 
      strength was well correlated with body cell mass [r = 0.8365, p < 0.0001].
      CONCLUSIONS: BMI is widely used for detecting malnutrition, but it is less
      sensitive in predicting loss of body cell mass and skeletal muscle mass. Our
      study shows that handgrip strength index is an effective and convenient parameter
      to predict the functional nutritional status and muscular health in CD patients.

TI  - Therapeutic Efficacy of Oral Enteral Nutrition in Pediatric Crohn's Disease: A
      Single Center Non-Comparative Retrospective Study.

AB  - PURPOSE: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) therapy effectively induces clinical
      remission in Crohn's disease (CD). It remains unclear, however, whether partial
      enteral nutrition (PEN) can maintain remission. This study was performed to
      determine the abilities of oral EEN and oral PEN to induce and maintain clinical 
      remission in pediatric patients with CD, respectively. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Pediatric patients with CD who received oral EEN at a single center in 2000-2014 
      were identified retrospectively. Remission rates of the EEN and PEN during the 2 
      years study period were determined. Risk factors for EEN and PEN failure were
      identified. RESULTS: Of the 66 patients who started EEN, 61 (92%) completed the
      course. Clinical remission was achieved in 88% (58/66) of the patients. All 58
      patients with remission continued with PEN: 43 (74%) were treatment adherent. The
      cumulative remission rates at 1 and 2 years were 67% and 52%, respectively.
      Differing from EEN, limited therapeutic efficacy of PEN was shown in severe CD
      patients. Female gender associated significantly with non-adherence. CONCLUSION: 
      Oral EEN and PEN effectively induced and maintained remission in a pediatric
      population. Non-adherence was a limiting factor in the success of therapy.

TI  - Inflammatory Bowel Disease Drugs: A Focus on Autophagy.
PG  - 118-127
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjw127 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] is characterized by chronic inflammation of the 
      gastrointestinal tract. Medications such as corticosteroids, thiopurines,
      immunomodulators and biologic agents are used to induce and maintain remission;
      however, response to these drugs is variable and can diminish over time.
      Defective autophagy has been strongly linked to IBD pathogenesis, with evidence
      showing that enhancing autophagy may be therapeutically beneficial by regulating 
      inflammation and clearing intestinal pathogens. It is plausible that the
      therapeutic effects of some IBD drugs are mediated in part through modulation of 
      the autophagy pathway, with studies investigating a wide range of diseases and
      cell types demonstrating autophagy pathway regulation by these agents. This
      review will highlight the current evidence, both in vitro and in vivo, for the
      modulation of autophagy by drugs routinely used in IBD. A clearer understanding
      of their mechanisms of action will be invaluable to utilize these drugs in a more
      targeted and personalized manner in this diverse and often complex group of
      patients.

TI  - A Frameshift in CSF2RB Predominant Among Ashkenazi Jews Increases Risk for
      Crohn's Disease and Reduces Monocyte Signaling via GM-CSF.
PG  - 710-723.e2
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2016.06.045 [doi]
LID - S0016-5085(16)34717-5 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Crohn's disease (CD) has the highest prevalence in Ashkenazi
      Jewish populations. We sought to identify rare, CD-associated frameshift variants
      of high functional and statistical effects. METHODS: We performed exome
      sequencing and array-based genotype analyses of 1477 Ashkenazi Jewish individuals
      with CD and 2614 Ashkenazi Jewish individuals without CD (controls). To validate 
      our findings, we performed genotype analyses of an additional 1515 CD cases and
      7052 controls for frameshift mutations in the colony-stimulating factor
      2-receptor beta common subunit gene (CSF2RB). Intestinal tissues and blood
      samples were collected from patients with CD; lamina propria leukocytes were
      isolated and expression of CSF2RB and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
      factor-responsive cells were defined by adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)
      time-of-flight mass cytometry (CyTOF analysis). Variants of CSF2RB were
      transfected into HEK293 cells and the expression and functions of gene products
      were compared. RESULTS: In the discovery cohort, we associated CD with a
      frameshift mutation in CSF2RB (P = 8.52 x 10(-4)); the finding was validated in
      the replication cohort (combined P = 3.42 x 10(-6)). Incubation of intestinal
      lamina propria leukocytes with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
      resulted in high levels of phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of 
      transcription (STAT5) and lesser increases in phosphorylation of extracellular
      signal-regulated kinase and AK straining transforming (AKT). Cells co-transfected
      with full-length and mutant forms of CSF2RB had reduced pSTAT5 after stimulation 
      with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, compared with cells
      transfected with control CSF2RB, indicating a dominant-negative effect of the
      mutant gene. Monocytes from patients with CD who were heterozygous for the
      frameshift mutation (6% of CD cases analyzed) had reduced responses to
      granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and markedly decreased activity 
      of aldehyde dehydrogenase; activity of this enzyme has been associated with
      immune tolerance. CONCLUSIONS: In a genetic analysis of Ashkenazi Jewish
      individuals, we associated CD with a frameshift mutation in CSF2RB. Intestinal
      monocytes from carriers of this mutation had reduced responses to
      granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, providing an additional
      mechanism for alterations to the innate immune response in individuals with CD.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: A severe clinical phenotype along with concern for ensuring normal 
      growth and development has a major impact on treatment choices for children newly
      diagnosed with Crohn's disease (CD). AREAS COVERED: We review the increasingly
      outdated concept of 'conventional' therapy of pediatric CD based on
      aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and immunomodulators for patients at high risk
      of complicated disease. Key safety concerns with each treatment are reviewed.
      EXPERT OPINION: There are minimal data supporting the use of aminosalicylates in 
      the treatment of pediatric CD. Corticosteroids are effective short-term for
      improving signs and symptoms of disease but are ineffective for maintenance
      therapy. Thiopurines decrease corticosteroid dependence but may not alter
      progression to complicated disease requiring surgery. Concerns for lymphoma as
      well as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis with thiopurines are valid. Further
      data are required on the efficacy and safety of methotrexate as an alternative
      immunomodulator. Though generally well tolerated and efficacious in most
      patients, anti-TNF-alpha therapy can be associated with both mild as well as more
      serious complications. Current data do not support an increased risk for
      malignancy associated with anti-TNF therapy alone in children. Anti-adhesion
      therapy appears to have a favorable safety profile but the experience in children
      is extremely limited.

TI  - Nutritional perspectives of children with Crohn's disease: a single-centre cohort
      observation of disease activity, energy expenditure and dietary intake.
PG  - 1132-1137
LID - 10.1038/ejcn.2016.107 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Children with Crohn's disease often demonstrate
      nutritional recovery during primary therapy at diagnosis, but long-term
      nutritional support is sometimes necessary. Evidence to inform best nutritional
      practice including energy and micronutrient requirements is limited. The
      principal objective of this study was to determine how energy expenditure and
      physical activity vary with disease activity over the first year following
      diagnosis. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Twenty children were studied at diagnosis with
      Crohn's disease and were followed up over 1 year while receiving treatment
      according to national guidelines. The majority of children (13) were treated with
      exclusive enteral nutrition. At study visits, height, weight, bioelectrical
      impedance, resting energy expenditure by indirect calorimetry, tri-axial
      accelerometer and blood investigations were performed alongside clinical
      assessment. RESULTS: There was no significant effect of disease activity on
      resting energy expenditure (REE). Physical activity was greater after primary
      therapy (Z=3.31, P<0.01). Median wPCDAI fell from 58 at diagnosis to 7.5 after
      primary therapy and was 7.5 at 1 year. Weight s.d.s increased from -1.67 to -0.86
      and lean index s.d.s increased from -2.93 to -1.64, although the increase was
      mostly in the first 2 months. Median height s.d.s was unchanged throughout this
      study. There was a significant association between dietary intake and weight gain
      (r=0.8 P<0.01) but not height gain. Persistent micronutrient deficits beyond
      diagnosis were seen for both iron and vitamin D. CONCLUSIONS: This study has
      demonstrated that REE does not change significantly through different phases of
      disease activity, but physical activity is low at diagnosis. Children with
      Crohn's disease should be screened for deficiencies of iron and vitamin D.

LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.10036 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal
      tract with an abnormal immune phenotype. We investigated how intracellular
      calcium kinetics of Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes alter upon specific inhibition of
      Kv1.3 and IKCa1 channels in pediatric Crohn's disease. STUDY DESIGN: Blood was
      taken from 12 healthy and 29 Crohn's disease children. Of those, 6 were switched 
      to infliximab and re-sampled after the 4th infliximab treatment. Intracellular
      calcium levels were monitored using flow cytometry in the presence or absence of 
      specific inhibitors of Kv1.3 and IKCa1 potassium channels. RESULTS: In Crohn's
      disease treated with standard therapy, calcium response during activation was
      higher than normal in Th2 cells. This was normalized in vitro by inhibition of
      Kv1.3 or IKCa1 potassium channels. After the switch to infliximab, potassium
      channel function and expression in Th2 lymphocytes were comparable to those in
      Th1 cells. CONCLUSION: These results may indicate that potassium channels are
      potential immune modulatory targets in Crohn's disease.

TI  - Genetic Association Analysis Reveals Differences in the Contribution of NOD2
      Variants to the Clinical Phenotypes of Orofacial Granulomatosis.
PG  - 1552-8
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000844 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Orofacial granulomatosis (OFG) is a rare, inflammatory disorder of
      the mouth, in which some patients also have intestinal Crohn's disease (CD). The 
      etiology remains largely unknown, although there is a high prevalence of atopy,
      and oral granulomas are also seen in other immune disorders particularly CD and
      sarcoidosis. We investigated whether genetic variants associated with an
      increased risk of CD, sarcoidosis, or atopy were also associated with
      susceptibility to OFG. METHODS: Patients were stratified clinically as isolated
      oral manifestations (OFG only) or concurrent intestinal CD (OFG+CD). We genotyped
      201 patients and 1023 healthy controls for risk variants in NOD2, IRGM, IL23R,
      ATG16L1 (CD), BTNL2 (sarcoidosis), and FLG (atopy). The coding regions of the
      NOD2 gene were screened for rare, potentially pathogenic variants in OFG.
      RESULTS: A combined analysis of 3 CD-risk variants in NOD2 showed no association 
      with any OFG subgroup. NOD2 p.L1007insC was associated with OFG+CD (P = 0.023)
      and IL23R p.R381Q with all OFG (P = 0.031). The sarcoidosis risk variant
      rs2076530 in BTNL2 was associated with all OFG (P = 0.013). We identified 7 rare 
      missense NOD2 alleles in 8 individuals with OFG, 4 OFG-only patients and 4
      patients with OFG+CD. There was a significant enrichment of NOD2 variants in the 
      OFG+CD group compared to the OFG-only group (P = 0.008, common variants; P =
      0.04, all common and rare variants). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that
      genetic variants in NOD2 are only associated with OFG in patients with concurrent
      intestinal disease. A genome-wide association scan is needed to fully define the 
      genetic architecture of OFG.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment for an intra-abdominal abscess/infection
      secondary to perforating ileocolic Crohn's disease (PCD) is unclear. METHODS:
      Forty-seven consecutive PCD patients treated via an institutional protocol of
      ileocolectomy after a 7-day period of percutaneous abscess drainage were
      retrospectively compared with 160 consecutive patients who underwent an elective 
      ileocolectomy for Crohn's disease (ECD) between 1992 and 2014. Outcomes were
      compared using univariate analysis and propensity score matching. RESULTS:
      Univariate analysis demonstrated significant differences in ileostomy rates (PCD:
      48.9% vs ECD: 18.8%; P = .001), 30-day readmissions (PCD: 38.3% vs ECD: 18.8%; P 
      = .01), and overall 30-day postoperative complications (PCD: 29.8% vs ECD: 15%; P
      = .03). After matching, a statistically significant difference was retained in
      ileostomy rates (P = .02) and 30-day readmissions (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: Early
      operative intervention after percutaneous drainage in perforating CD may be
      associated with a high incidence of diversions and readmissions.

TI  - An Antibody Against Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 1 (TREM-1)
      Dampens Proinflammatory Cytokine Secretion by Lamina Propria Cells from Patients 
      with IBD.
PG  - 1803-11
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000822 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1) is a potent
      amplifier of inflammation. Recently, the antimicrobial peptide PGLYRP-1 was shown
      to be the ligand of TREM-1. Here, the ability of an anti-TREM-1 antibody to
      dampen the release of proinflammatory cytokines by colon lamina propria cells
      (LPCs) from patients with IBD was investigated and correlated with PGLYRP-1
      levels. METHODS: Biopsies from patients with ulcerative colitis (UC, n = 45) or
      Crohn's disease (CD, n = 26) were compared with those from individuals undergoing
      colonoscopy for other reasons (n = 17). TREM-1 expression was analyzed on myeloid
      cells by flow cytometry. Cell culture experiments with LPCs were used to analyze 
      PGLYRP-1 and inflammatory cytokine levels and assess the effect of anti-TREM-1 on
      cytokine secretion. RESULTS: The frequency of TREM-1-expressing neutrophils and
      recruited macrophages was higher in inflamed than in noninflamed biopsies. The
      PGLYRP-1 level in inflamed tissue was higher than in noninflamed tissue; it was
      produced primarily by neutrophils, and its level correlated with the secretion of
      proinflammatory cytokines. Secretion of myeloperoxidase, tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, and interleukin-8 by LPCs stimulated with the
      potent TREM-1 agonist consisting of PGLYRP-1 complexed with peptidoglycan was
      reduced in the presence of anti-TREM-1. Moreover, a blocking effect of
      anti-TREM-1 was apparent when LPCs from a subset of inflamed individuals with
      elevated PGLYRP-1 were stimulated with killed bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: An
      anti-TREM-1 antibody can dampen secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in
      inflamed patients with elevated PGLYRP-1. Moreover, PGLYRP-1 + myeloperoxidase is
      a potential biomarker for predicting the effect of anti-TREM-1 therapy.

AB  - Over the past 20 years, a growing amount of evidence supports the role of
      microbes and an imbalanced microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). While 
      many reviews have been written on the microbiota in IBD, few have considered how 
      they fulfil the Koch's postulates. In this review, we consider how the Koch's
      postulates might be modified so that they can be fulfilled for polymicrobial
      diseases, and we discuss the progress made to date in fulfilling them.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease, cancer and medication: Cancer risk in the Dutch
      population-based IBDSL cohort.
PG  - 1270-80
LID - 10.1002/ijc.30183 [doi]
AB  - The management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has changed since the
      mid-1990s (e.g., use of thiopurines/anti-TNFalpha agents, improved surveillance
      programs), possibly affecting cancer risk. To establish current cancer risk in
      IBD, updates are warranted from cohorts covering this time span, and detailed
      enough to study associations with phenotype and medication. We studied
      intestinal-, extra-intestinal- and overall cancer risk in the Dutch
      population-based IBDSL cohort. In total, 1,157 Crohn's disease (CD) and 1,644
      ulcerative colitis (UC) patients were diagnosed between 1991 and 2011, and
      followed until 2013. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for CD 
      and UC separately, as well as for gender-, phenotype-, disease duration-,
      diagnosis era- and medication groups. We found an increased risk for colorectal
      cancer in CD patients with colon involvement (SIR 2.97; 95% CI 1.08-6.46), but
      not in the total CD or UC population. In addition, CD patients were at increased 
      risk for hematologic- (2.41; 1.04-4.76), overall skin- (1.55; 1.06-2.19), skin
      squamous cell- (SCC; 3.83; 1.83-7.04) and overall cancer (1.28; 1.01-1.60),
      whereas UC patients had no increased risk for extra-intestinal- and overall
      cancer. Finally, in a medication analysis on CD and UC together, long-term
      immunosuppression exposure (>12 months) was associated with an increased risk for
      hematologic cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, SCC and overall cancer, and this
      increase was mainly attributed to thiopurines. IBD patients with long-term
      immunosuppression exposure can be considered as having a higher cancer risk, and 
      our data support the advice in recent IBD guidelines to consider skin cancer
      screening in these patients.

TI  - Enteral feeding reduces metabolic activity of the intestinal microbiome in
      Crohn's disease: an observational study.
PG  - 1052-6
LID - 10.1038/ejcn.2016.74 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Enteral feeding will induce remission in as many as 80-90%
      of compliant patients with active Crohn's disease (CD), but its method of action 
      remains uncertain. This study was designed to examine its effects on the colonic 
      microbiome. METHODS/SUBJECTS: Healthy volunteers and patients with CD followed a 
      regimen confined to enteral feeds alone for 1 or 2 weeks, respectively. Chemicals
      excreted on breath or in faeces were characterised at the start and at the end of
      the feeding period by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. RESULTS: One week of 
      feeding in healthy volunteers caused significant changes in stool colour and
      deterioration in breath odour, together with increased excretion of phenol and
      indoles on the breath. Feeding for 2 weeks in patients with CD produced
      significant improvements in symptoms and a decrease in the concentration of
      C-reactive protein. The faecal concentrations of microbial products, including
      short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and potentially toxic substances, including
      1-propanol, 1-butanol and the methyl and ethyl esters of SCFAs, showed
      significant falls. CONCLUSIONS: A significant change occurs in the production of 
      microbial metabolites after enteral feeding in both healthy volunteers and
      patients with CD. Many of those detected in CD are toxic and may feasibly lead to
      the immunological attack on the gut microbiota, which is characteristic of
      inflammatory bowel disease. The reduction in the production of such metabolites
      after enteral feeding may be the reason for its effectiveness in CD.

TI  - Adiposity is associated with early reduction in bone mass in pediatric
      inflammatory bowel disease.

LID - S0899-9007(16)00034-4 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The effect of adiposity on bone mass in the early phases of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children and adolescents is unclear. The aim 
      of this study was to determine the role of adiposity on bone mass in the first 3 
      y of diagnosis of IBD. The expected result is that increased adiposity will be
      associated with increased bone mass in both the controls and IBD subjects.
      METHODS: Height-adjusted bone mineral density (BMD) z-scores of 25 subjects, age 
      13.97 +/- 2.70 y, diagnosed with IBD for <4 y were compared to 24 controls, age
      13.65 +/- 2.60 y. Overweight was defined as BMI of >/=85th but <95th percentile, 
      and obesity as BMI >/=95th percentile. Severity of IBD was determined by the
      Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index and Lichtiger Colitis Activity Index.
      RESULTS: Before stratification by BMI criterion, height-adjusted BMD z-scores
      were not significantly lower in IBD subjects versus controls for both the femoral
      neck (-0.8 +/- 1.1 versus -0.06 +/- 1.1, P = 0.070) and lumbar vertebrae (-0.4
      +/- 1.2 versus 0.2 +/- 1.2, P = 0.086). Following stratification, height-adjusted
      BMD z-scores were significantly lower in the overweight/obese IBD subjects versus
      overweight/obese controls for femoral neck (-0.9 +/- 0.9 versus 0.3 +/- 1.3, P = 
      0.032); and non-significantly lower for the lumbar spine z-score (-0.4 +/- 1.6
      versus 0.5 +/- 1.3, P = 0.197). BMD z-score had no relationship with the duration
      of disease, steroid therapy, and the severity of disease. CONCLUSION: Adiposity
      was associated with reduced bone mass in the early phases of IBD, but with
      increased bone mass in the controls.

TI  - pANCA and ASCA in Children with IBD-Unclassified, Crohn's Colitis, and Ulcerative
      Colitis-A Longitudinal Report from the IBD Porto Group of ESPGHAN.
PG  - 1908-14
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000784 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: No study to date has evaluated perinuclear antineutrophil
      cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA) and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA) in
      pediatric inflammatory bowel disease-unclassified (IBDU) as compared with Crohn's
      colitis (CC) and ulcerative colitis (UC), which represent the diagnostic
      challenge. We aimed to explore the diagnostic utility of serology and to assess
      whether serology can predict disease severity in these subgroups. METHODS: This
      was a multicenter retrospective longitudinal study including 406 children with
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) from 23 centers affiliated with the Porto group
      of European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (mean
      age 10.5 +/- 3.9, 54% males); 117 (29%) with CC, 143 (35%) with UC, and 146 (36%)
      with IBDU. Median follow-up period was 2.8 years (interquartile range, 1.6-4.2). 
      RESULTS: The most prevalent serologic profile in IBDU was pANCA-/ASCA- (41%),
      followed by pANCA+/ASCA- (34%) and pANCA-/ASCA+ (17%). pANCA-/ASCA+
      differentiated well between CC versus IBDU (83% specificity, 96% positive
      predictive value [PPV]) and UC (97% specificity, 90% PPV) patients, albeit with a
      low negative predictive value (13% and 40%, respectively). pANCA+/ASCA- did not
      differentiate as well between IBD subgroups, but UC children with pANCA+/ASCA-
      had more often severe disease at diagnosis (36 [62%] versus 22 [38%], P = 0.033) 
      and needed more often calcineurin inhibitors, biologics, or colectomy (25 [80%]
      versus 6 [20%], P = 0.026). In CC, double positivity for ASCA and not
      pANCA-/ASCA+ profile was associated with disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: Serology 
      may have some role in predicting disease course and outcomes in colonic IBD, but 
      its routine use needs to be supported by more studies. Serology cannot routinely 
      be recommended for differentiating between IBDU versus CC or UC as a sole
      diagnostic criterion given its low diagnostic utility.

TI  - Timing of Last Preoperative Dose of Infliximab Does Not Increase Postoperative
      Complications in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients.
PG  - 2602-7
LID - 10.1007/s10620-016-4171-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The association between preoperative use of infliximab and
      postoperative complications in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is 
      a subject of continued debate. Results from studies examining an association
      between the timing of last preoperative dose of infliximab and postoperative
      complications remain inconsistent. AIMS: To assess whether timing of last dose of
      infliximab prior to surgery affects the rate of postoperative complications in
      patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Retrospective chart
      review of IBD patients who have undergone surgery while receiving therapy with
      infliximab was conducted. Forty-seven patients were included in the analysis.
      RESULTS: No significant association was found between timing of infliximab and
      the rate of postoperative complications. Age, gender, disease type, steroid use, 
      preoperative status, surgery type, or surgeon type was not associated with
      increased rate of postoperative complications. CONCLUSION: Timing of last dose of
      infliximab does not affect the rate of postoperative complications in patients
      with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.

      Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). A cross-sectional postal
      questionnaire was sent to people with IBD who were booked into an adult IBD or
      Gastroenterology clinic over a 6-week period. There were 416 eligible people and 
      168 (40%) responded. Sixty-four (42%) people indicated that food affects their
      symptoms a lot or severely. Eighty (51%) respondents indicated that diet was
      important or extremely important in controlling symptoms. Significantly more
      people with CD reported meat, fatty foods, chocolate and salad as a trigger than 
      people with UC. Significantly more people with UC reported wheat as a trigger.
      More people with CD avoided meat and chocolate than UC. This survey highlights
      the importance of nutrition and diet to people with IBD. Frequent food avoidance 
      was reported. This may impact on nutrition-related health problems.

TI  - The prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome-type symptoms in paediatric
      inflammatory bowel disease, and the relationship with biochemical markers of
      disease activity.
PG  - 181-8
LID - 10.1111/apt.13636 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A large proportion (25-46%) of adults with inflammatory bowel disease
      in remission has symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which are thought to
      reflect ongoing inflammation. Data on paediatric inflammatory bowel disease
      patients are lacking. AIM: To investigate (i) the prevalence of IBS-type symptoms
      in paediatric inflammatory bowel disease patients in remission and (ii) the
      relationship of IBS-type symptoms with biochemical markers of disease activity.
      METHODS: This cross-sectional study included all patients (<18 years) with
      Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis attending the out-patient clinic of one of 
      three Dutch hospitals between March 2014 and June 2015. Clinical disease activity
      was determined using the abbreviated-PCDAI or PUCAI. Biochemical disease activity
      was assessed using faecal calprotectin and serum CRP. IBS-symptoms were assessed 
      using physician-administered Rome III-questionnaires. RESULTS: We included 184
      patients (92 female; mean age: 14.5 years) (Crohn's disease: 123, ulcerative
      colitis: 61). The prevalence of IBS-type symptoms in children with inflammatory
      bowel disease in clinical remission was 6.4% (95% CI: 2.5-11.1%; Crohn's disease:
      4.5%; ulcerative colitis: 10.8%). Prevalence of IBS-type symptoms in children
      with faecal calprotectin <250 mug/g was 16.1% (95% CI: 7.6-25.8%; Crohn's
      disease: 16.7%; ulcerative colitis: 10.8%). No difference in faecal calprotectin 
      or CRP was found between patients in clinical remission with or without IBS-type 
      symptoms (faecal calprotectin: IBS+ median 58 mug/g, IBS- 221 mug/g, P = 0.12;
      CRP: IBS+ median 1.4 mg/L, IBS- 1.1 mg/L, P = 0.63). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence 
      of IBS-type symptoms in children with inflammatory bowel disease is highly
      dependent on the definition of remission. Nonetheless, the prevalence is much
      lower than that previously reported in studies in adult inflammatory bowel
      disease patients. IBS-type symptoms appear to be unrelated to gastrointestinal
      inflammation.

TI  - L-Arginine Availability and Metabolism Is Altered in Ulcerative Colitis.
PG  - 1847-58
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000790 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: L-arginine (L-Arg) is the substrate for both inducible nitric oxide
      (NO) synthase (NOS2) and arginase (ARG) enzymes. L-Arg is actively transported
      into cells by means of cationic amino acid transporter (SLC7) proteins. We have
      linked L-Arg and arginase 1 activity to epithelial restitution. Our aim was to
      determine if L-Arg, related amino acids, and metabolic enzymes are altered in
      ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Serum and colonic tissues were prospectively
      collected from 38 control subjects and 137 UC patients. Dietary intake,
      histologic injury, and clinical disease activity were assessed. Amino acid levels
      were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Messenger RNA (mRNA)
      levels were measured by real-time PCR. Colon tissue samples from 12 Crohn's
      disease patients were obtained for comparison. RESULTS: Dietary intake of
      arginine and serum L-Arg levels were not different in UC patients versus control 
      subjects. In active UC, tissue L-Arg was decreased, whereas L-citrulline (L-Cit) 
      and the L-Cit/L-Arg ratio were increased. This pattern was also seen when paired 
      involved (left) versus uninvolved (right) colon tissues in UC were assessed. In
      active UC, SLC7A2 and ARG1 mRNA levels were decreased, whereas ARG2 and NOS2 were
      increased. Similar alterations in mRNA expression occurred in tissues from
      Crohn's disease patients. In involved UC, SLC7A2 and ARG1 mRNA levels were
      decreased, and NOS2 and ARG2 increased, when compared with uninvolved tissues.
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients with UC exhibit diminished tissue L-Arg, likely
      attributable to decreased cellular uptake and increased consumption by NOS2.
      These findings combined with decreased ARG1 expression indicate a pattern of
      dysregulated L-Arg availability and metabolism in UC.

      Transplantation.
PG  - 1763-76
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000792 [doi]
AB  - Despite recent therapeutic advances, patients with Crohn's disease (CD) continue 
      to experience high recurrence with cumulative structural damage and ultimate loss
      of nutritional autonomy. With short bowel syndrome, strictures, and enteric
      fistulae being the underlying pathology, CD is the second common indication for
      home parenteral nutrition (HPN). With development of intestinal failure,
      nutritional management including HPN is required as a rescue therapy.
      Unfortunately, some patients do not escape the HPN-associated complications.
      Therefore, the concept of gut rehabilitation has evolved as part of the
      algorithmic management of these patients, with transplantation being the ultimate
      life-saving therapy. With type 2 intestinal failure, comprehensive rehabilitative
      measures including nutritional care, pharmacologic manipulation, autologous
      reconstruction, and bowel lengthening is often successful, particularly in
      patients with quiescent disease. With type 3 intestinal failure, transplantation 
      is the only life-saving treatment for patients with HPN failure and intractable
      disease. With CD being the second common indication for transplantation in
      adults, survival outcome continues to improve because of surgical innovation,
      novel immunosuppression, and better postoperative care. Despite being a rescue
      therapy, the procedure has achieved survival rates similar to other solid organs,
      and comparable to those who continue to receive HPN therapy. With similar
      technical, immunologic, and infectious complications, survival is similar in the 
      CD and non-CD recipients. Full nutritional autonomy is achievable in most
      survivors with better quality of life and long-term cost-effectiveness. CD
      recurrence is rare with no impact on graft function. Further progress is
      anticipated with new insights into the pathogenesis of CD and mechanisms of
      transplant tolerance.

TI  - Interobserver Variation Study of the Rutgeerts Score to Assess Endoscopic
      Recurrence after Surgery for Crohn's Disease.
PG  - 1001-5
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjw082 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: After resection surgery for Crohn's disease, recurrence of endoscopic
      lesions at the site of the anastomosis or in the neoterminal ileum is graded
      according to the Rutgeerts score (RS). The goal of this study was to test the
      interobserver variability for RS. METHODS: Thirteen trained endoscopists
      evaluated the RS on 39 videotapes of patients who had undergone resection for
      Crohn's disease with an ileocolonic anastomosis 6 months earlier. Videotapes were
      randomly assigned to endoscopists through a balanced incomplete block design.
      Each videotape was scored independently by four endoscopists, and each
      endoscopist evaluated 12 videotapes, making a total of 156 videotape assessments.
      Reproducibility levels of the RS were assessed through unweighted kappa estimates
      among multiple raters. The proportion of inappropriate therapeutic initiation was
      estimated by randomly selecting one endoscopist for each videorecording, assuming
      that the majority of endoscopists correctly classified endoscopic recurrence.
      RESULTS: The kappa estimates were 0.43 (95% confidence interval: 0.33-0.52) for
      the RS on a 5-grade scale, 0.47 (0.28-0.66) for RS < i2 vs. >/= i2, and 0.64
      (0.42-0.85) for RS </= i2 vs. > i2. The percentages of inappropriate therapeutic 
      initiation were 12.8% (3.8-21.9) when initiation was triggered by a RS >/= i2 and
      8.3% (1.1-15.6) when initiation was triggered by a RS > i2 (p = 0.41).
      CONCLUSION: The reproducibility of the RS was moderate, especially when
      differentiating <i2 from >/=i2, which may lead to incorrect therapeutic decisions
      in >10% of patients.

TI  - Genomic Alterations Observed in Colitis-Associated Cancers Are Distinct From
      Those Found in Sporadic Colorectal Cancers and Vary by Type of Inflammatory Bowel
      Disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's
      disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are at increased risk for small bowel
      or colorectal cancers (colitis-associated cancers [CACs]). We compared the
      spectrum of genomic alterations in CACs with those of sporadic colorectal cancers
      (CRCs) and investigated differences between CACs from patients with CD vs UC.
      METHODS: We studied tumor tissues from patients with CACs treated at Memorial
      Sloan Kettering Cancer Center or Weill Cornell Medical College from 2003 through 
      2015. We performed hybrid capture-based next-generation sequencing analysis of
      >300 cancer-related genes to comprehensively characterize genomic alterations.
      RESULTS: We performed genomic analyses of 47 CACs (from 29 patients with UC and
      18 with CD; 43 primary tumors and 4 metastases). Primary tumors developed in the 
      ileum (n = 2), right colon (n = 18), left colon (n = 6), and rectosigmoid or
      rectum (n = 21). We found genomic alterations in TP53, IDH1, and MYC to be
      significantly more frequent, and mutations in APC to be significantly less
      frequent, than those reported in sporadic CRCs by The Cancer Genome Atlas or
      Foundation Medicine. We identified genomic alterations that might be targeted by 
      a therapeutic agent in 17 of 47 (36%) CACs. These included the mutation encoding 
      IDH1 R132; amplification of FGFR1, FGFR2, and ERBB2; and mutations encoding BRAF 
      V600E and an EML4-ALK fusion protein. Alterations in IDH1 and APC were
      significantly more common in CACs from patients with CD than UC. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      an analysis of CACs from 47 patients, we found significant differences in the
      spectrum of genomic alterations in CACs compared with sporadic CRCs. We observed 
      a high frequency of IDH1 R132 mutations in patients with CD but not UC, as well
      as a high frequency of MYC amplification in CACs. Many genetic alterations
      observed in CACs could serve as therapeutic targets.

TI  - Effect of Psychotherapy on Health Care Utilization in Children With Inflammatory 
      Bowel Disease and Depression.
PG  - 658-664
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at an
      increased risk of developing depression compared with community controls.
      Depression often negatively influences illness behaviors such as resource
      utilization. We sought to investigate the effects of treating depression on
      utilization of medical resources in depressed pediatric patients with IBD by
      comparing rates of health care utilization 1 year before and after psychotherapy.
      METHOD: Two hundred seventeen subjects ages 9 to 17 years with IBD and depression
      received 3 months of psychotherapy for depression as part of a multicenter
      randomized controlled trial. Of these 217 subjects, 70 had utilization data
      available 1 year prior and 1 year after receiving 3 months of psychotherapy.
      Primary outcomes included frequency of hospitalizations, inpatient hospital days,
      outpatient gastrointestinal visits, and number of emergency room visits,
      radiological examinations, and endoscopies. Within subject analyses were
      completed comparing health care utilization 12 months before psychotherapy
      compared with the 12 months after the conclusion of psychotherapy. RESULTS:
      Fifty-one and 19 patients had CD and UC, respectively. A total of 55.7% of
      patients had major depression and 44.3% had minor depression. Overall, all study 
      measures of health care utilization were significantly reduced after
      psychotherapy (P < 0.01)-including gastrointestinal-related (mean values)
      hospitalization frequency, inpatient days, outpatient visit, emergency room
      visits, radiological examinations, and endoscopies. CONCLUSIONS: Psychotherapy
      for comorbid depression in pediatric patients with IBD is associated with
      decreased GI-related health care utilization. The present study highlights the
      importance of screening for depression in a pediatric population with IBD, and
      that psychotherapy may be a reasonable adjunctive treatment for pediatric
      patients with IBD and comorbid depression.

TI  - Early Mucosal Healing with Exclusive Enteral Nutrition is Associated with
      Improved Outcomes in Newly Diagnosed Children with Luminal Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1159-64
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjw075 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Exclusive Enteral Nutrition (EEN) induction in children with luminal 
      Crohn's disease (CD) gives early mucosal healing (MH), but the long-term benefits
      of EEN-induced MH are just emerging. AIMS & METHODS: We prospectively followed an
      Australian cohort of newly diagnosed children with predominantly luminal CD who
      completed at least six weeks EEN and with paired clinical Pediatric Crohn's
      Disease Activity Index (PCDAI), biochemical (C-reactive protein; CRP) and
      endoscopic assessment at diagnosis and post EEN. All commenced immunomodulators
      (IMs) early (<3 months from diagnosis) and had a minimum of 1 year follow-up.
      Complete MH was a simple endoscopic score for Crohn's disease (SES-CD) of 0, and 
      SES-CD>/=1 was ascribed to active endoscopic disease (aED) and further divided
      into near complete MH (SES 1-3), mild active disease (SES-CD 4-10) and moderate
      to severe disease (SES-CD>10). The primary outcome was long-term supervised
      sustained remission (SR) on IMs alone without need for corticosteroids,
      infliximab (IFX) or surgery. RESULTS: A total of 54 eligible children (33 males) 
      completing EEN induction were analysed. The median duration between pre and post 
      EEN assessments was 60.5 days [interquartile range (IQR), 56-69.5]. Post EEN:
      clinical remission (PCDAI < 10) was observed in 45/54 (83%), and biochemical
      remission (PCDAI < 10 and CRP < 5 mg/dl) was observed in 39/54 (72%). Complete MH
      was observed in 18/54 (33%), near complete in 10/54(19%). SR was superior in
      those with complete MH vs. aED; 13/18, (72%) vs. 10/36 (28%), p = 0.003 at 1
      year, 8/16, (50%) vs. 3/24, (8%), p = 0.008 at 2 years and (8/16, (50%) vs. 1/19,
      (6%), p = 0.005) at 3 years. Near-complete MH did not lead to superior SR.
      CONCLUSIONS: Only complete MH post EEN induction predicts more favourable SR for 
      up to 3 years.

AB  - GOAL: The primary aim of this study was to determine predictors of clinically
      significant computed tomography (CT) scans, paying particular attention to
      findings of previous CT scans. BACKGROUND: Use of CT to assess patients with
      Crohn's disease (CD) in the Emergency Department (ED) is both costly and exposes 
      patients to high levels of ionizing radiation while not clearly improving
      outcomes. STUDY: Patients with CD who underwent CT scan in the Emergency
      Department from 2008 to 2011 at a tertiary referral center were assessed for
      clinically significant findings. A multivariable generalized estimating equation 
      model with logit link and exchangeable working correlation structure was
      constructed to assess for independent predictors of CT scans with clinically
      significant findings. RESULTS: A total of 118 patients with CD underwent 194 CT
      scans. Ninety-two of 194 (47%) CT scans demonstrated clinically significant
      findings. Predictors of clinically significant CT scans included ileal disease
      involvement [odds ratios (OR) 3.47, P=0.01] and white blood cell count >12 (OR
      2.1, P=0.03). Most notably, patients with a CT scan without clinically
      significant findings performed in the preceding month were significantly less
      likely to have a clinically significant CT scan (OR 0.23, P=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Patients with CD who had a CT scan without significant findings the month prior
      are unlikely to have clinically significant CT findings. Ileal disease and an
      elevated white blood cell are predictive of clinically significant CT scans.

TI  - Time to Relapse in Children with Crohn's Disease Treated with Azathioprine and
      Nutritional Therapy or Corticosteroids.
PG  - 2041-50
LID - 10.1007/s10620-016-4103-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The duration of remission has been shown to be longer in patients
      initially treated with exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) compared to
      corticosteroids (CS). However, no published studies required concurrent
      immunomodulator [6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine (AZA)] use at the time of
      diagnosis. AIMS: The aims of this retrospective study were to compare the
      duration of remission between patients initially treated with AZA in combination 
      with CS or EEN and identify predictors of early relapse in these patients.
      METHODS: Data from 65 newly diagnosed children with CD in clinical remission on
      either EEN or CS and commencing AZA at diagnosis were included. We compared
      duration of remission using physician global assessment and carried out Cox
      regression analysis to identify predictors of early relapse. Patients were
      followed up to the time of first relapse or for at least 12 months. RESULTS:
      There were no differences in the duration of remission between patients initially
      treated with EEN or CS (p = 0.978). We identified younger age at diagnosis
      [hazard ratio (HR) 0.87, 95 CI 0.78-0.98, p = 0.016], lower height Z score at
      diagnosis (HR 0.61, 95 CI 0.44-0.85, p = 0.003), involvement of the upper
      gastrointestinal tract (HR 2.69, 95 CI 1.27-5.66, p = 0.009), and elevated
      platelet count at remission (HR 1.004, 95 CI 1.001-1.008, p = 0.021) as
      independent predictors of early relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Neither induction regime
      demonstrated longer duration of remission of CD in patients treated with
      immunomodulators since the time of diagnosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Postoperative complications are relatively frequent in Crohn's
      disease (CD) and several risk factors have been identified. The influence of
      genetic factors, however is unknown. METHODS: CD patients who underwent
      CD-related bowel resection were identified from the "Nancy IBD cohort."
      Postoperative complications were defined as intraabdominal infectious
      complications and non-intraabdominal infectious complications occurring within 90
      days after operation. The influence of 203 single nucleotide polymorphisms on
      postoperative complication rates was analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 137 patients who
      had undergone a CD-related bowel resection in our cohort, postoperative
      complications occurred in 34 cases (24.8%). Postoperative intraabdominal
      infections occurred in 18 cases (13.1%): 12 had anastomotic leakage and 6 had
      intraabdominal abscesses. In multivariate analysis, current smoker status (odds
      ratio [OR], 2.71; 95% CI, 1.18-6.21; P = .02) and homozygosity for the risk
      allele (T) Nucleotide-binding Oligomerization Domain-containing protein 2
      (rs5743289; NOD2; OR, 2.07 [95% CI 1.15-3.72]; P = .01) were independent risk
      factors of postoperative intraabdominal infectious complications. Current smoker 
      status NOD2 homozygosity for the risk allele (T) were not associated with
      non-intraabdominal infectious complications. CONCLUSION: Current smoker status
      was associated with increased risk of postoperative intraabdominal infectious
      complications. A novel association between the NOD2 allele and an increased risk 
      of postoperative intraabdominal infectious complications was observed in this
      study.

TI  - Impact of Preoperative Exclusive Enteral Nutrition on Postoperative Complications
      and Recurrence After Bowel Resection in Patients with Active Crohn's Disease.
PG  - 1993-2000
LID - 10.1007/s00268-016-3488-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The impact of preoperative enteral nutrition (EN) on postoperative
      complications and recurrence in Crohn's disease (CD) has not been investigated to
      date. The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of
      preoperative exclusive EN on postoperative complications and recurrence after
      bowel resection in patients with active CD. METHODS: Patient data were obtained
      from a prospectively maintained database. 81 patients who received bowel
      resection for ileal or ileocolonic CD were studied. Before operation, 42 CD
      patients received exclusive EN for 4 weeks, and the other patients had no
      nutritional therapy. All patients were followed up regularly for 2 years after
      surgery, and ileocolonoscopy was performed every 6 months after bowel resection. 
      RESULTS: Patients receiving exclusive EN had a dramatic improvement of
      nutritional (BMI, albumin, pre-albumin, and Hb) and inflammatory (CRP and CDAI)
      status compared with baseline after the EN therapy for 4 weeks (P < 0.05).
      Furthermore, significantly lower incidence of both infectious and non-infectious 
      complications was observed in patients receiving exclusive EN compared with those
      received no nutritional therapy (P < 0.05). Exclusive EN therapy for 4 weeks
      significantly reduced endoscopic recurrence rates after resection for CD 6 months
      after operation. However, during the 2-year follow-up, incidence of clinical
      recurrence was similar in both groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative
      exclusive EN therapy for 4 weeks reduced postoperative complications, which may
      be associated with improvement of nutritional and inflammatory status in patients
      with active CD.

TI  - Growth Pattern in Paediatric Crohn Disease Is Related to Inflammatory Status.
PG  - 637-643
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The respective role of disease activity and steroid therapy in growth
      impairment in paediatric-onset Crohn disease (CD) is still debated. Our aim was
      to investigate whether the growth pattern of children with CD was correlated with
      the inflammatory status during the disease course, regardless the cumulative
      duration of steroid therapy. METHODS: One hundred and seven patients with a
      diagnosis of CD <17 years, followed during >/=2 years and for whom >/=2 height
      measures were available during follow-up, were identified between 1998 and 2010. 
      Height, C-reactive protein (CRP), orosomucoid, and steroid therapy duration were 
      collected at each visit. The relationship between the evolution of growth
      velocity and inflammatory status during follow-up was investigated using a linear
      mixed model with random coefficients. RESULTS: Median age at diagnosis was 11.7
      years (Q1-Q3: 9.8-13.5). Mean height for age (H/A) z score was 0.14 +/- 1.29 at
      diagnosis and 0.05 +/- 1.23 among the 75 patients who had reached their final
      height at maximal follow-up (median: 4.9 years; Q1-Q3: 3.8-6.4). Growth failure
      (H/A z score <-2) was present in 7 (8%) patients at diagnosis and 5 (5%) at
      maximal follow-up. Growth velocity was negatively correlated with the evolution
      of CRP (P < 0.0001) and orosomucoid (P < 0.0001) during follow-up. After
      adjustment for the cumulative duration of steroid therapy, these 2 correlations
      remained significant (CRP: P = 0.0008; orosomucoid: P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS:
      Children with CD with uncontrolled inflammatory status have a lower growth
      velocity. The inflammatory status should be kept as close to normal as possible
      in paediatric-onset patients with CD to optimize their growth pattern.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Diet assessment is essential in the care of patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We aimed to study food intake in children with 
      IBD and evaluated the relation of dietary intake with disease activity and
      nutritional status in these children. METHODS: This cross-sectional study
      investigated 68 children and adolescents with IBD (57 Crohn disease, 11
      ulcerative colitis). Evaluation included clinical, laboratory, and nutritional
      assessment including 3 days diet record. RESULTS: Compared with recommended daily
      allowance, the intake of patients with IBD was significantly poor for
      carbohydrates (75%, P = 0.016), calcium (49%, P < 0.05), magnesium (76%, P <
      0.05), vitamin A (72%, P < 0.05), vitamin E (57%, P < 0.05), and fiber (44%, P < 
      0.05) and higher for protein (175%, P < 0.05), iron (112%, P < 0.05), and
      water-soluble vitamins (118%-189% P < 0.05). Compared with the intakes of healthy
      children from National Nutritional Survey, the intake of IBD group was lower for 
      calories (78%, P = 0.012), carbohydrates (61% P < 0.05), magnesium (67% P <
      0.05), vitamin C (34%, P < 0.05), and fiber (54%, P < 0.05) and high for B12
      (141%, P < 0.05). Fifty subjects ate ordinary diets, 7 of 68 children were on
      exclusive enteral nutrition and 11 of 68 consumed regular food with different
      polymeric formulas supplements. Compared with children without supplements,
      children on exclusive enteral nutrition and nutritional supplements (18/68) had
      significantly better intakes of energy (1870 +/- 755 vs 2267 +/- 432, P < 0.05), 
      carbohydrates (223 +/- 97 vs 292 +/- 99, P < 0.05), and all minerals (P < 0.05)
      and micronutrients (P < 0.05). Dietary intake was not different by disease status
      (remission or relapse). CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of nutritional supplements,
      food intake is inadequate for many nutrients in many children with IBD.

TI  - Plasma intestinal fatty acid-binding protein fails to predict endoscopic disease 
      activity in inflammatory bowel disease patients.
PG  - 807-13
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0000000000000616 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Monitoring disease activity in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is of
      major importance to prevent long-term complications. Intestinal fatty
      acid-binding protein (I-FABP) has been identified as a marker for intestinal
      damage and correlates with the degree of inflammation. The aim of the present
      study was to evaluate whether I-FABP can predict active disease or remission in
      Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) in a real-life IBD cohort.
      METHODS: In total, 70 patients with endoscopic disease activity available and 194
      patients with disease activity on the basis of a stringent combi-score of
      clinical activity index, C-reactive protein, and fecal calprotectin were
      included. Plasma I-FABP was compared between patients with active disease and
      remission. In a small subgroup of CD patients, follow-up samples were analyzed.
      RESULTS: In CD (139.2 vs. 119.2 pg/ml; P=0.37) and UC (107.8 vs. 151.8 pg/ml;
      P=0.33), the median I-FABP did not differ in endoscopic active disease versus
      remission. In UC patients with active disease on the basis of the combi-score,
      the median I-FABP (106.8 vs. 172.0 pg/ml; P=0.03) was significantly lower than in
      patients in remission, but not in CD (145.5 vs. 157.5 pg/ml; P=0.29). Neither
      disease location in CD nor extent of disease in UC influenced I-FABP
      significantly. I-FABP was not different (P=0.78) in CD patients with a change in 
      disease activity over time. CONCLUSION: Plasma I-FABP did not differ between
      endoscopic active disease and remission in both CD and UC. I-FABP was lower in
      active UC but not CD on the basis of the combi-score. On the basis of these
      findings, I-FABP has no potential as a novel noninvasive biomarker for disease
      activity in IBD.

TI  - Perinatal vitamin D levels are not associated with later risk of developing
      pediatric-onset inflammatory bowel disease: a Danish case-cohort study.
PG  - 927-33
LID - 10.3109/00365521.2016.1144218 [doi]
AB  - Objective Basic and epidemiologic studies on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      have suggested an association between vitamin D and IBD risk. Though, the
      literature on IBD - especially pediatric-onset IBD - and vitamin D is still in
      its cradle. We therefore wanted to examine if levels of 25(OH)D at birth were
      associated with increased risk of developing pediatric-onset IBD. Material and
      methods A case-cohort study composed of cases diagnosed with Crohn's disease,
      ulcerative colitis or indeterminate/unclassified colitis and healthy controls.
      Cases and controls were matched on date of birth and were born in the period
      1981-2004. Cases were diagnosed before the age of 18 years. The concentration of 
      25(OH)D was assessed from neonatal dried blood spots using a highly sensitive
      liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated 
      using conditional logistic regression and two-way ANOVA were used to test for
      season and birth year 25(OH)D variations. A total of 384 matched pairs were
      included in the statistical analyses. Results No significant association were
      found between levels of 25(OH)D and IBD risk in the adjusted model (OR [95% CI]
      (per 25 nmol/L increase), 1.12 [0.88; 1.42], p = 0.35). 25(OH)D levels were found
      to fluctuate significantly with season (p < 0.001) and year (p < 0.001).
      Median/Q1-Q3 values for 25(OH)D were 27.1/16.5-39.5 nmol/L for cases and
      25.7/16.1-39.4 nmol/L for controls. Conclusion Our study do not suggest that a
      window of vulnerability exist around time of birth in regards to 25(OH)D levels
      and later pediatric-onset IBD risk.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Young individuals with Crohn disease (CD) are at risk of poor bone
      mineral density (BMD) and reduced lean tissue mass (LTM). The importance of LTM
      for maintaining skeletal health, in both incident and established CD, is
      evidenced. We used dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry assessment to identify areal 
      BMD and LTM in individuals with CD. METHODS: In 57 patients with CD (15F;
      12.99-14.16 years) anthropometric, disease activity, bone age assessment, and
      total body dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry measurements were acquired. A 4-step 
      algorithm was used to assess simultaneous bone and body composition data: areal
      BMD and height z scores, and LTM for height and bone mineral content (BMC) for
      LTM z scores were calculated. Low z score cut-off values were defined as </=1
      standard deviations below the population means. RESULTS: The CD cohort showed:
      low areal BMD z scores (P = 0.00); and low LTM for height (P = 0.00) according to
      defined cut-off values. BMC appeared to be adapting for the lower amount of LTM. 
      Correcting for bone age eliminated the low areal BMD z scores. As expected, LTM
      for height and BMC for LTM z scores remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: We present a
      useful clinical algorithm to show significant LTM for height deficits, regardless
      of chronological or bone age, in this CD cohort. BMC seemed to adapt to the
      reduced LTM, indicating clinically "normal" areal BMD for age when considered for
      height. The ongoing deficits in LTM may, however, create chronic long-term
      consequences for bone health. Improving LTM should be a focus of clinical
      treatment in individuals with CD.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Metastatic Crohn's disease (MCD) is an
      extraintestinal manifestation of Crohn's disease, with biopsy as fundamental
      diagnostic tool. There are few references to MCD in children, with a 0.5-1%
      estimated incidence in adults. There is no consensus about its therapeutic
      approach. We describe our diagnostic and therapeutic experience in MCD. RESULTS: 
      Four cases of MCD are described in our Pediatric Gastroenterology Unit in a
      tertiary care hospital. The age at diagnosis was between 7 and 13 years. Lesions 
      appeared before the diagnosis of Crohn's disease in three of them, and during the
      course of the disease in another one, with genital location in three patients and
      bilateral pretibial region in the other. All four cases demonstrated
      non-caseificant granulomas on biopsy. Only two patients used exclusive enteral
      nutrition therapy with complete resolution, while other two cases received a
      combination of therapies (corticosteroids, azathioprine, tacrolimus, infliximab
      and adalimumab) because of recurrence. Only one case required surgery after poor 
      clinical control. CONCLUSION: The MCD is infrequent but must always be included
      in the differential diagnosis of cutaneous lesions in Crohn's disease,
      considering it could be the debut of the disease. We will rely on biopsy anyway
      for definitive diagnosis. In this series the genital region is verified as the
      most commonly affected in children. The therapeutic approach does not differ from
      the management of intestinal involvement.

TI  - Paediatric Crohn Disease: Disease Activity and Growth in the BELCRO Cohort After 
      3 Years Follow-up.
PG  - 253-8
LID - 10.1097/MPG.0000000000001132 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Belgian registry for paediatric Crohn disease (BELCRO) cohort is a
      prospective, multicentre registry for newly diagnosed paediatric patients with
      Crohn disease (CD) (<18 years) recruited from 2008 to 2010 to identify predictive
      factors for disease activity and growth. METHODS: Data from the BELCRO database
      were evaluated at diagnosis, 24 and 36 months follow-up. RESULTS: At month 36
      (M36), data were available on 84 of the 98 patients included at diagnosis.
      Disease activity evolved as follows: inactive 5% to 70%, mild 19% to 24%, and
      moderate to severe 76% to 6%. None of the variables such as age, sex, diagnostic 
      delay, type of treatment, disease location, disease activity at diagnosis, and
      growth were associated with disease activity at M36. Paediatricians studied
      significantly less patients with active disease at M36 compared with adult
      physicians. Sixty percent of the patients had biologicals as part of their
      treatment at M36. Adult gastroenterologists initiated biologicals significantly
      earlier. They were the only factor determining biologicals' initiation, not
      disease location or disease severity at diagnosis. Median body mass index (BMI) z
      score evolved from -0.97 (range -5.5-2.1) to 0.11 (range -3.4-2) and median
      height z score from -0.15 (range -3.4-1.6) to 0.12 (range -2.3-2.3) at M36. None 
      of the variables mentioned above influenced growth over time. CONCLUSIONS:
      Present treatment strategies lead to good disease control in the BELCRO cohort
      after 3 years. Logistic regression analysis did not show any influence of disease
      location or present treatment strategy on disease activity and growth, but
      patients under paediatric care had significantly less severe disease at M36.

TI  - Heterogeneity in endoscopic treatment of Crohn's disease-associated strictures:
      An international inflammatory bowel disease specialist survey.
PG  - 939-48
LID - 10.1007/s00535-016-1172-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is frequently complicated by intestinal
      strictures, which are commonly treated by endoscopic balloon dilation (EBD).
      However, available data on this area of treatment is limited. The aim of this
      study was to depict the heterogeneity of endoscopic management of CD-associated
      strictures among international CD specialists to identify common treatment
      standards. METHODS: IBD experts of the International Organization for the Study
      of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IOIBD), the European Crohn's and Colitis
      Organization (ECCO), and from the Prospective Value In IBD trials (PROVIT)
      completed a web-based questionnaire to evaluate their endoscopic experience,
      practice setting, and number of EBDs performed annually. Additionally, two case
      scenarios and technical practice parameters were investigated. RESULTS: A total
      of 126 subjects from 15 countries completed the survey. The maximal length of
      dilated stricture was 4.5 +/- 1.7 cm. The most commonly used maximal balloon size
      was graded as 15-18 mm. While 87.2 % of the participants favored EBD for
      anastomotic strictures, only 58.6 % did so in the case of naive strictures. Only 
      35.7 % of physicians dilated actively inflamed strictures. Interventional
      endoscopists were more likely to dilate only clinically symptomatic strictures (p
      = 0.046). Surgeons favored surgical treatment of de novo ileocecal strictures
      compared to gastroenterologists (p = 0.026), reported a shorter stricture length 
      being amendable by EBD (p = 0.045), and more frequently used concomitant
      therapies (p = 0.001). Operator experience increased the likelihood of EBD use in
      actively inflamed strictures (p = 0.002), maximum length of stricture, and
      maximum balloon size (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: EBD is a widely used treatment
      approach for stricturing CD. Individual approaches differ significantly based on 
      background of the operator, experience level, and practice setting.

TI  - Exploring and Enhancing the Anti-Inflammatory Properties of Polymeric Formula.
PG  - 436-445
LID - 10.1177/0148607115625627 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) therapy using a polymeric formula
      (PF) can substantially attenuate intestinal inflammation in Crohn's disease (CD) 
      patients. However, the mechanism(s) by which EEN suppresses inflammation are not 
      yet fully understood. The aims were to examine cellular mechanism(s) through
      which EEN may suppress inflammation and investigate potential pathways to enhance
      anti-inflammatory properties of EEN. METHODS: Glutamine, arginine, vitamin D3,
      and alpha linolenic acid (ALA), present in PF, along with curcumin, were
      identified as immunoactive nutrient therapies. Tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF)-alpha-exposed HT-29 colonic epithelial cells were used to investigate the
      immunosuppressive activity of the nutrients by assessing their effect on cell
      viability, cell activity, chemokine response (interleukin-8 [IL-8]), nuclear
      factor (NF)-kappaB, P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, IkappaB kinase
      (Ikappakappa), and nitric oxide (NO). RESULTS: Cellular viability and activity
      were maintained with all nutrient treatments. Glutamine, arginine, and vitamin
      D3, but not ALA, significantly attenuated IL-8 production. Glutamine and arginine
      led to phosphorylation blockade of the signaling components in NF-kappaB and P38 
      pathways, reduction in kinase activity, and enhancement in NO production.
      Combining glutamine, arginine, and curcumin at optimal concentrations completely 
      abolished the IL-8 response. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that glutamine,
      arginine, and vitamin D3 can suppress inflammation at concentrations equivalent
      to those used in PF. The mechanisms of this action were mediated through
      influencing the NF-kappaB and P38 cascades. Glutamine and arginine-fortified PF
      with curcumin might be a promising option to enhance the effectiveness and expand
      the scope of EEN therapy in CD treatment.

      Although identifying patients at risk of failure could have important
      implications for follow-up, literature in this area remains sparse. Our primary
      aim was to identify predictors of loss of response to infliximab among patients
      who were responders to induction. The secondary aim was to identify predictors of
      non-response to induction. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of patients with
      paediatric Crohn's disease treated with infliximab between 2000 and 2013 was
      followed until loss of response to infliximab or transfer to adult care.
      Predictors of response to induction therapy were studied by multivariate logistic
      regression. Time to treatment failure was analysed with a multivariate Cox model.
      RESULTS: Two-hundred and forty-eight patients were eligible for the study. Of
      these, 196 (79%) were responders to induction (57% clinical remission and 22%
      clinical response) and 52 (21%) were non-responders. Steroid resistance was the
      only variable independently associated with primary non-response (odds ratio [OR]
      4.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.67-12.50, p = 0.002). Thirty-one of the 196 
      responders discontinued infliximab due to loss of response after a mean of
      1.6+/-1.3 years of treatment. Predictors of loss of response were level of
      response to induction (clinical response vs clinical remission, hazard ratio [HR]
      3.74, 95% CI 1.80-7.80, p = 0.0004) and isolated colonic disease (HR 2.72, 95% CI
      1.30-5.71, p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who fail to achieve clinical
      remission after induction and/or who have isolated colonic disease are at
      increased risk of loss of response to infliximab.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Autoimmune liver disease is reported in up to 7.8% of children with
      inflammatory bowel disease. A distinct inflammatory bowel disease phenotype has
      been suggested in adults and in small pediatric cohorts. The aim of the study was
      to evaluate the features of inflammatory bowel disease associated with autoimmune
      liver diseases and to analyze the characteristics of the liver disease. METHODS: 
      Information on patients was obtained from the Italian Pediatric Inflammatory
      Bowel Disease Registry. Data of patients with and without autoimmune liver
      disease were compared. RESULTS: Autoimmune liver disease was detected in 6.8% of 
      the 677 patients enrolled and was significantly associated with the diagnosis of 
      ulcerative colitis (83%), with pancolonic involvement (84%), and with perinuclear
      antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody positivity (41%) (all Ps < 0.05). Autoimmune 
      liver disease was defined as sclerosing cholangitis in 61% of the patients and as
      an overlap syndrome in 33%. Concomitant intra- and extrahepatic biliary
      involvement was reported in 61% of cases, whereas exclusive extrahepatic lesions 
      were reported in 21%. Hepatobiliary complications were observed in 9% of the
      patients during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Autoimmune liver disease, especially
      sclerosing cholangitis, was significantly more common in patients with extensive 
      ulcerative colitis. Although complications are relatively rare in the pediatric
      age, monitoring is recommended.

TI  - Delineation of Crohn's Disease Trajectories Using Change in Lemann Index: A
      Natural History Study.
PG  - 476-82
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0000000000000463 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) causes lifelong, progressive bowel damage, which
      may be quantified using the Lemann Index (LI). We aimed to analyze patterns of LI
      and its association with 5-year clinical course, in an independent cohort of CD
      patients. METHODS: CD patients with 5-year follow-up from a registry maintained
      at a tertiary center were included. LI was calculated using a computerized metric
      from the first (LI1) and last (LI2) clinical encounters during the 5 years.
      Groups were created based on change in score (LI2-LI1) or the delta Lemann Index 
      (DLI) as showing improvement, no change, or deterioration and used for
      association analysis with patterns of health care utilization, disease activity, 
      and quality-of-life scores. RESULTS: A total of 363 CD patients with 5-year
      follow-up formed the study population [median age 43 y (interquartile range
      (IQR), 33.3 to 55 y); 57% female; median disease duration 12 y (IQR, 3 to 19 y), 
      overall surgical exposure 69.7%]. Median (IQR) LI1, LI2, and DLI were 8 (0 to
      54), 9 (0 to 75), and 0 (-22 to -47), respectively. Patients were stratified
      based on DLI into 3 groups: A: DLI<0; B: DLI=0; and C: DLI>0; which comprised
      16.5%, 35.3%, and 48.2% of the cohort, respectively. Patients in group C had
      significantly higher CD-related surgical exposure, health care utilization, and
      annual use of steroids and biological agents. DLI showed independent significant 
      positive correlation with perianal disease (P=0.044), steroid use (P=0.007),
      clinical visits (P<0.001), and new surgeries (P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Change in LI
      over time could function as a marker of disease trajectory for risk
      substratification and prognostication in CD.

TI  - Five-Year Period Prevalence and Characteristics of Anemia in a Large US
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease Cohort.
PG  - 638-43
LID - 10.1097/MCG.0000000000000417 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anemia is a common manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),
      but its prevalence in the United States is not well defined. Aim of this study
      was to determine the prevalence and characteristics of anemia in IBD patients who
      were followed in a US referral center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Demographic,
      clinical, laboratory, and treatment data from a prospective, consented
      longitudinal IBD registry between the years 2009 and 2013 were analyzed. Disease 
      activity was evaluated using Harvey-Bradshaw index in Crohn's disease (CD) and
      ulcerative colitis (UC) activity index in UC as well as C-reactive protein and
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Anemia was defined based on the World Health
      Organization criteria. RESULTS: A total of 1821 IBD patients (1077 with CD, 744
      with UC, median age 43.8 y, 51.9% female) were included. The 5-year period
      prevalence of anemia in IBD patients was 50.1%, (CD: 53.3% vs. UC: 44.7%,
      P=0.001). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, anemia was associated
      with surgery for IBD [odds ratio (OR)=2.77; 95% confidence interval (CI),
      2.21-3.48; P<0.0001], female gender (OR=1.29; 95% CI, 1.04-1.61; P=0.02),
      C-reactive protein (OR=1.26; 95% CI, 1.16-1.37; P<0.0001), erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate (OR=1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.03; P=0.0002), and use of biologics
      (OR=2.00; 95% CI, 1.58-2.52; P=0.0001) or immunomodulators (OR=1.51; 95% CI,
      1.21-1.87; P=0.0003). Iron replacement therapy was administered to 46.8% of the
      anemic patients. CONCLUSION: Anemia has a high period prevalence in IBD patients 
      followed at a tertiary center. Anemia is more common in CD than in UC, is
      associated with disease activity, and in current practice is undertreated.

TI  - Influence of nutritional status on the therapeutic effect of infliximab in
      patients with Crohn's disease.

AB  - PURPOSE: Crohn's disease (CD) is a refractory inflammatory bowel disease of
      unknown etiology, frequently complicated by malnutrition. It is thought that the 
      delayed wound healing associated with this malnutrition in CD patients might
      adversely affect the therapeutic benefits of infliximab (IFX). Therefore, we
      investigated the effects of nutritional status on IFX treatment. METHODS: We
      assessed nutritional status and CD activity when IFX therapy was initiated and
      following the third dose, 6 weeks later. Nutritional status was assessed using
      the body mass index (BMI) and nutritional risk index (NRI), whereas CD activity
      was assessed using the CD activity index (CDAI). RESULTS: All patients with a BMI
      >/= 18.5 kg/m(2) at the time of IFX therapy met the effective criteria for the
      CDAI, and IFX treatment was considered responsive in these patients. Furthermore,
      IFX treatment was responsive, with a high level of effectiveness, in all five
      subjects (31.3 %) with NRI scores of 97.5 and above with no risk of malnutrition 
      (p = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that nutritional status does
      influence the therapeutic effect of IFX in CD patients. The response rate to IFX 
      treatment thus could be improved by optimizing the nutritional status. We
      recommend comprehensive nutritional assessment and intervention prior to IFX
      treatment schedules.
