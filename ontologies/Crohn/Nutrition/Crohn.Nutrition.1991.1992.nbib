TI  - [Parenteral nutrition in treatment of short stature in adolescents with Crohn
      disease].
PG  - 411-6
AB  - Growth retardation and delayed puberty occur in 20-35% of children and
      adolescents with Crohn's disease. Alternate day corticosteroid treatment, use of 
      azathioprine, enteral or parenteral hyperalimentation and surgery have been
      advocated to reverse growth failure. Because of nonacceptance of elemental diet 7
      patients with Crohn's disease and growth retardation received parenteral
      nutrition for 2-3 months (maximal for more than 30 months in one patient). All of
      them exhibited a mean weight gain of 10 kg and a mean increase of their height
      velocity from 2.4 to 7.1 cm/year. Main problems were bacterial infections and
      dislocations of the central lines. Surgery was performed in 3 adolescents
      immediately after parenteral nutrition. One patient showed a catch-up growth
      during a 30-months nocturnal home parenteral nutrition at a biological age of 21 
      years. Parenteral nutrition is an effective regimen to manage growth failure in
      children with Crohn's disease, but has to be performed for larger periods in
      individual cases.

TI  - Colonic preservation reduces need for parenteral therapy, increases incidence of 
      renal stones, but does not change high prevalence of gall stones in patients with
      a short bowel.
PG  - 1493-7
AB  - Forty six patients with less than 200 cm of normal jejunum and no functioning
      colon were compared with 38 patients with similar jejunal lengths in continuity
      with a functioning colon. Women predominated (67%), and the most common diagnosis
      in each group was Crohn's disease (33 of 46 no colon, 16 of 38 with colon). All
      patients without a colon and less than 85 cm of jejunum and all those with a
      colon and less than 45 cm jejunum needed long term parenteral nutrition. Six
      months after the last resection 12 of 17 patients with less than 100 cm jejunum
      and no colon needed intravenous supplements compared with 7 of 21 with a colon.
      Between 6 months and 2 years, little change occurred in the nutritional/fluid
      requirements in either group, though there was weight gain. Of 71 patients
      assessed clinically at a median of 5 years, none with more than 50 cm of jejunum 
      and a colon needed parenteral supplements. Most (25 of 27) of those without a
      colon who did not need parenteral supplements required oral electrolyte
      replacement compared with few (4 of 27) with a colon. None of the patients
      without a colon developed symptomatic renal stones compared with 9 of 38 (24%)
      with a colon (p < 0.001). Stone analysis in three patients showed calcium
      oxalate. Gall stone prevalence was high but equal in the two groups--43% of those
      without and 44% of those with a colon.

TI  - Effect of intravenously infused eicosapentaenoic acid on the leukotriene
      generation in patients with active Crohn's disease.
PG  - 938-42
AB  - Ten patients with active Crohn's disease who have been managed with
      parenteral-nutrition therapy were administered a lipid emulsion either with
      [containing 0.6 g eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)] or without fish oil for 2 wk. We
      isolated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) from the patients before and after 
      this treatment and measured the amounts of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and leukotriene 
      B5 (LTB5) generated by activated PMNLs by reversed-phase HPLC. The LTB5
      generation in active Crohn's disease before this treatment was significantly
      lower than in healthy control subjects. The amount of LTB5 and the LTB5-LTB4
      ratio increased significantly after fish-oil supplementation. The difference with
      LTB4 was not statistically significant. We have shown that daily intravenous
      administration of 0.6 g EPA influenced the generation of leukotrienes in active
      Crohn's disease even after short-term treatment. Further investigations are
      necessary to clarify the correlation between EPA and clinical improvement in
      Crohn's disease.

TI  - Home parenteral nutrition in patients with a cancer diagnosis.
PG  - 93S-99S
AB  - The clinical outcome for 1362 patients with active cancer managed on home
      parenteral nutrition (HPN) is compared with that of 122 patients with radiation
      enteritis ("cured" cancer) and 416 patients with Crohn's disease. This
      longitudinal clinical information was reported to the North American Home
      Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition Registry (Oley Foundation/A.S.P.E.N. joint
      project) between 1985 and 1989. The data shows that the number of active cancer
      patients on this therapy is increasing 13% per year. The annual survival rate is 
      25% for patients with active cancer, as compared with 88% for patients with
      radiation enteritis and 95% for patients with Crohn's disease. Although 50% of
      all active cancer patients starting HPN are dead within 6 to 9 months, the
      prognosis is somewhat better in children, and 20% of these active cancer patients
      appear to do well, returning to full oral nutrition and experiencing complete
      rehabilitation. These are presumed to be patients with a potentially curable
      cancer requiring super-aggressive treatment, which causes temporary severe
      gastrointestinal dysfunction. Adult active cancer patients have the same
      rehospitalization rate for HPN complications (once per year) as radiation
      enteritis and Crohn's disease patients. However, their rehospitalization rate for
      non-HPN complications is four times higher. This article reviews the factors that
      may explain the growth of HPN in active cancer patients and discusses some of the
      unanswered clinical questions that urgently need to be addressed to more
      effectively determine the appropriateness or inappropriateness of HPN management 
      in the active cancer setting.

TI  - Is preoperative parenteral nutrition necessary for patients with predominantly
      ileal Crohn's disease?
PG  - 1210-2
AB  - We reviewed 46 consecutive patients with Crohn's disease predominantly affecting 
      the ileum who specifically underwent right-sided ileocolectomy with primary
      anastomosis. All had a primary ileocolic anastomosis done by suture in a
      single-layer closed fashion. Of these 46 patients, 19.6% had overt
      intra-abdominal sepsis, 30.4% had prior surgery, and 95.7% were taking
      corticosteroid drugs just before their operation. The mean (+/- SE) age was 31.5 
      +/- 2.0 years. The serum albumin level was less than 35 g/L in 93.5% of patients;
      all had a hematocrit value less than 0.36, and 80.4% lost more than 15% of their 
      normal body weight. No patient received parenteral nutrition either
      preoperatively or postoperatively. No change in the preoperative, intraoperative,
      or postoperative approach to treating patients with predominantly ileal Crohn's
      disease occurred during the 10-year period of review. There was a 2.2% incidence 
      of perioperative complications (one superficial wound infection) and a 6.5%
      incidence of late (>1.49 months) complications (two suture sinuses and one wound 
      abscess unassociated with a fistula). Our findings suggest that preoperative
      parenteral nutrition is unnecessary in the majority of patients with
      predominantly ileal Crohn's disease specifically undergoing right-sided
      ileocolectomy and primary ileocolic anastomosis.

TI  - Lipocortin-present perforating and lipocortin-absent nonperforating Crohn's
      disease.
PG  - 341-4
AB  - To investigate whether Crohn's disease has two different clinical forms, a
      relatively aggressive perforating type and a more indolent nonperforating type,
      we compared the concentrations of lipocortin and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in the
      inflamed mucosa of 12 patients with strictly controlled Crohn's disease with
      those found in histologically normal mucosa of control subjects. The inflamed
      mucosa obtained from eight patients with nonperforating Crohn's disease did not
      react with antilipocortin antibody on immune blot analysis. In contrast, the
      inflamed mucosa from four patients with perforating Crohn's disease, as well as
      that obtained from histologically normal controls, contained lipocortins. In
      addition, higher concentrations of intramucosal ileal and colonic PGE2 were found
      in patients with nonperforating Crohn's disease (902 +/- 454 pg/wet weight [WW]
      mg and 1,268 +/- 567 pg/WW mg, respectively) compared with normal controls (90.2 
      +/- 43.1 pg/WW mg and 173 +/- 76.5 pg/WW mg, respectively) (p less than 0.01).
      The difference in intramucosal ileal and colonic PGE2 levels between patients
      with perforating Crohn's disease (109.6 +/- 16.7 pg/WW mg and 252 +/- 34.4 pg/WW 
      mg, respectively) and normal controls was not significant. These findings
      indicate that there may be two distinct patterns of Crohn's disease that differ
      in the amount of lipocortin present in the intestinal mucosa.

      pathologic correlates.
PG  - 1148-53
AB  - To determine the incidence of gastric emptying abnormalities in children with
      inflammatory bowel disease, we performed dual liquid/solid-emptying studies on 25
      children with ulcerative colitis (UC) and on 45 with Crohn's disease (CD) over a 
      6-yr period. Nutritional parameters were evaluated initially and at the time of
      repeat study in those with abnormal emptying after a period of nutritional
      rehabilitation. All UC patients and 30 of 45 with CD (67%) had normal emptying of
      both liquid and solid components of the meal. Fifteen children with CD had
      delayed emptying of the solid liquid. Fourteen of these had preceding weight loss
      and one had no weight gain for 3 months prior to the study. Twelve complained of 
      upper gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, early satiety, postprandial epigastric
      pain, and anorexia), and five had evidence of growth retardation. The group
      averaged 4.8 abnormal nutritional parameters, compared with an average of 2.2 in 
      those with CD and normal gastric emptying. Twelve of the 15 with abnormal
      emptying had abnormal gastric and/or duodenal biopsies: 10 were treated with
      sulfasalazine and prednisone, whereas five were taking only sulfasalazine.
      Studies repeated 6-15 months later after establishment of weight gain by caloric 
      supplementation showed significant improvements in gastric emptying, nutritional 
      status, and disease activity for the group, despite persistence of upper
      gastrointestinal disease documented in eight patients who underwent
      reexamination.

TI  - Balance studies and polymeric glucose solution to optimize therapy after massive 
      intestinal resection.
PG  - 755-60
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine whether fluid homeostasis could be
      maintained by using a hypo-osmolar (200 to 221 mosmol/kg), relatively low-sodium 
      (50 to 52 mmol/liter) solution that contained a glucose polymer in a 54-year-old 
      patient with high ileostomy output attributed to short-gut syndrome and resultant
      prerenal azotemia. Sequential balance studies were performed to assess stool and 
      urinary output, stool fat, and urinary electrolytes initially during intravenous 
      rehydration and subsequently during administration of the necessary fluids and
      nutrients exclusively by oral supplementation. The additional effects of high-fat
      and low-fat diet, loperamide hydrochloride, and octreotide acetate were
      evaluated. When the patient sipped a hypo-osmolar oral rehydration solution while
      she was awake during the day and received a high dose of loperamide and a 40-g
      fat, disaccharide-free diet, salt and water homeostasis was maintained. The
      addition of octreotide did not substantially enhance fluid balance; rather, it
      increased fecal fat and fluid losses from the small bowel. Thus, hypo-osmolar
      polymeric glucose solutions maintain fluid homeostasis in patients with the
      short-gut syndrome. In such patients, simple balance studies are useful for
      assessing the absorptive capacity of the residual intestine, for developing an
      optimal individualized treatment, and for eliminating the need for costly,
      long-term home parenteral nutrition.

AB  - A 29-year-old patient suffering from stenosis of the rectum and a periproctal
      fistula due to a severe form of Crohn's disease was completely fed by the
      parenteral route for 15 months, incl. 13 months at home, via a totally implanted 
      cannula system Implantofix, Braun Co.. The patient felt throughout the period of 
      parenteral nutrition very well, he worked and the secretion from the fistula
      stopped after four weeks. After 15 months of complete parenteral nutrition and
      elimination of oral food intake a marked improvement of the local finding in the 
      rectum was observed. All laboratory findings (haemogram, liver tests, urea,
      creatinine, transferrin, albumin, cholinesterase and pre-albumin, serum levels of
      sodium, potassium, chlorides, calcium and phosphates) were throughout the
      observation period within a normal range. The body weight of the patient
      increased during the 15 months by 1 kg. The described case is the first one where
      domiciliary parenteral nutrition was used in Czechoslovakia under ambulatory
      conditions.

TI  - Factors influencing first relapse in patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 12-6
AB  - To determine whether information available at time of diagnosis of Crohn's
      disease can predict initial clinical course, I followed 239 patients
      prospectively from time of diagnosis to initial relapse. The patient's sex,
      smoking habits, contraceptive usage, disease extent, and presence of granulomas
      in the first histological specimen were recorded. No association was found
      between this demographic data and the interval between onset of symptoms and
      diagnosis, the severity of symptoms at presentation, or the time to relapse. The 
      type of relapse, however, was influenced by the type of the first attack; 70% of 
      relapses were of the same type as the initial attack. Cigarette smoking was
      associated with ileocolitis (p = 0.028). There was a trend for oral contraceptive
      users to have ileocolitis, whereas the presence of granulomas in the first
      histological specimen was not associated with a specific disease distribution.
      Patients with ileocolitis had more inflammatory attacks than those with ileitis
      or colitis (p = 0.001). There was also a trend for cigarette smokers and those on
      oral contraceptives to have more inflammatory attacks, but the presence of
      granulomas had no effect on the type of relapse. There is little to assist in
      prognosis of early disease when the diagnosis of Crohn's disease is first made,
      although the types of attacks tend to repeat themselves.

OAB - A surgeon followed 239 people diagnosed with Crohn's disease while they were
      patients at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa between 1970 and
      1988 until 1st relapse or for 10 years to determine whether risk factors of the
      disease predicts the clinical disease course. 156 (65%) had suffered from a
      relapse. The relapse type of about 70% of these cases was of the same type as the
      1st attack. Cigarette smokers were more likely to experience ileocolitis than
      nonsmokers (47% vs. 32%; p=.028). Ileocolitis was linked to an increased number
      of inflammatory attacks (47% vs. 35% for ileitis and 14% for colitis; p=.001).
      Thus the researcher concluded that cigarette smoking is linked to Crohn's disease
      and influences the underlying disease process. A nonsignificant trend existed for
      combined oral contraceptive use and increased numbers of inflammatory attacks and
      ileocolitis. Histological granulomas did not effect the relapse pattern of the
      patients. The Quetelet Index indicated that females were more likely to be
      malnourished than males (561 vs. 645; p.0001). They presented with more severe
      Crohn's disease at diagnosis. Obstruction was responsible for 40% of relapses in 
      patients with ileitis. Other than the fact that the type of attack 1st
      experienced by an individual tends to be the same as the relapse attack, this
      study did not provide physicians any additional information to help with
      prognosis of early diagnosis of Crohn's disease.

TI  - [Possibilities and limitations of nutritional support in Crohn disease].
PG  - 161-5
AB  - Crohn's disease involves a great risk of malnutrition. Malabsorption, bacterial
      contamination, frequent abdominal surgery, meal-related pain, protein loss
      through the damaged mucosa contribute to creating nutritional problems.
      Malnutrition can worsen the outcome, both in medical and surgical patients, and
      deteriorate an often already altered immune response. Weight loss, low levels of 
      blood protein, electrolytes, micronutrients and vitamins are usually related to
      the extension of the mucosal damage. Nutritional assessment can be difficult due 
      to oedema and bleeding, who interfere with both clinical and laboratory
      evaluation. The exact amount of nitrogen, lipids, minerals stool loss can be
      useful. It is widely accepted the use of nutritional support in Crohn's disease, 
      but many Authors do not agree concerning the route (enteral or parenteral) and
      the kind of nutrient to be used. Still controversial is the role of nutrition:
      just support or real therapy? Most recent hypothesis concerning the pathogenesis 
      of Crohn's disease indicate food and/or bacterial antigens as involved in
      determining the pathology. The "bowel rest", considered for many years as a
      fasting period necessarily supported by parenteral nutrition, can also be
      obtained by the temporarily reduction or stop in presenting those antigens to the
      bowel mucosa. This new concept can be achieved not only by parenteral nutrition, 
      but with an enteral elemental diet as well. The elemental diet contains all
      nutrients in the simplest way and thus succeeds in lowering or eliminating the
      antigenic power. The reported results seem to indicate an equivalence of enteral 
      and parenteral nutrition; anyway enteral is advisable when feasible, being more
      physiological and less expensive and involving a lower risk of serious
      complications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - About 20% of patients with active Crohn's disease do not respond to
      acute-phase-therapy with glucocorticoids at an initial dose of 60 mg
      prednisolone-equivalent and stepwise dose reduction every week. In case of
      primary failure of this therapeutic scheme the dose of glucocorticoids has to be 
      enhanced. If necessary a combination with total parenteral nutrition or tube
      feeding should be used. In case of early recurrence of inflammation during dose
      reduction or chronic steroid-dependent disease activity a combination of
      glucocorticoids with Azathioprine will be successful in about 75% of patients. In
      addition a combination of glucocorticoids with tube feeding (elemental or
      polymeric diet) will lead to remission of inflammatory activity in about 60 to
      70% of these patients. In patients, who are still refractory to these therapeutic
      procedures, operation should be discussed.

TI  - Increased pulmonary and intestinal permeability in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 678-82
AB  - We tested the hypothesis that an increased epithelial permeability may affect
      sites other than the intestine in patients with Crohn's disease by simultaneously
      evaluating their pulmonary and intestinal permeability. Pulmonary and intestinal 
      permeability were measured by clearance of inhaled technetium-99m diethylene
      triamine pentacetate (99mTc-DTPA) and by urinary recovery of chromium-51 ethylene
      diamine tetracetate respectively in 22 patients with Crohn's disease. The half
      time clearance of 99mTc-DTPA from lung to blood (t1/2LB) was decreased--that is
      pulmonary permeability increased--in the whole group of patients with Crohn's
      disease as compared with 13 controls (median 45.5 minutes (8-160) v 85 minutes
      (34-130) (p less than 0.003)). When analysed separately only patients with active
      Crohn's disease (n = 15) had a decreased t1/2 lung to blood v controls (42
      minutes (8-160) v 85 minutes (34-130) (p less than 0.0025)). Among patients with 
      active Crohn's disease, six were studied again when their disease was quiescent
      and their t1/2 lung to blood did not differ significantly. The intestinal
      permeability was increased in the whole group of Crohn's disease patients as
      compared with 15 controls (5.25% (1.2-24) v 1.7% (0.65-5.75) (p less than
      0.0002)). When analysed separately both patients with active and inactive Crohn's
      disease had increased intestinal permeability v controls (8.1% (1.6-24) and 3.5% 
      (1.2.9.2) v 1.7% (0.65-5.75)) (p less than 0.0001, p = 0.05 respectively). Six
      patients with active Crohn's disease were studied again when their disease was
      quiescent and their intestinal permeability decreased significantly p less than
      0.04). Pulmonary permeability was increased in patients with Crohn's disease but 
      was not greatly influenced by Crohn's disease activity as opposed to intestinal
      permeability. The mechanism of this increase is unknown, but may be related in
      some patients to the presence of an alveolitis.

AB  - Malnutrition was included by Crohn as one of the features of the new disease he
      described. Most patients with Crohn's disease are malnourished even if their
      disease is not active. Nutritional factors may be implicated in the aetiology of 
      the disease, but this remains unproven. The role of nutritional support and
      therapy is discussed and it is suggested that improving the patient's nutritional
      status may have a primary therapeutic as well as a supportive role in the
      treatment of the disease.

TI  - A randomized prospective trial comparing a defined formula diet, corticosteroids,
      and a defined formula diet plus corticosteroids in active Crohn's disease.
PG  - 328-33
AB  - Although defined formula diets may be useful for initial episodes of Crohn's
      disease, the effects of these diets on subsequent attacks of Crohn's disease or
      in conjunction with corticosteroids are unknown. To evaluate these issues, we
      studied 27 patients in a randomized prospective trial. Ten patients received only
      prednisone (group I), nine received only a defined formula diet (Vital HN [high
      nitrogen]) (group II), and eight received a combination of prednisone and Vital
      HN (group III). At the time of entry into the study, the groups were similar with
      respect to age, sex, Crohn's Disease Activity Index, previous and current
      treatments, anatomic site of disease, and nutritional status. After 1 month of
      treatment, we noted seven successes (70%) and three failures in group I
      (prednisone only), three successes (33%) and six failures in group II (Vital HN
      only), and six successes (75%) and two failures in group III (combination
      therapy). Four patients randomized to receive only Vital HN were unable or
      unwilling to tolerate the defined formula diet. Of the five patients who were
      able to take the defined formula diet for 1 month, however, three (60%) were
      successfully treated. The patients who received prednisone (groups I and III)
      responded better than did the patients who received only the defined formula
      diet. These results may be attributable to the use of a nonelemental diet or the 
      treatment of patients who were not experiencing an initial attack of Crohn's
      disease or who had previously received corticosteroids. The expensive and often
      poorly tolerated defined formula diets should not be considered as a substitute
      for standard therapy with corticosteroids in Crohn's disease.

PG  - 74-6
AB  - We report a patient with regional enteritis and short bowel syndrome who has been
      treated with home parenteral nutrition for 19 years, during 10 of which he used a
      single Broviac central venous catheter. The catheter finally required replacement
      because of progressive lumen occlusion, which was presumed to be caused by
      thrombosis. At the time of replacement, the catheter was found to be friable and 
      embedded in a hard sheath that made it adherent to the wall of the internal
      jugular vein and prevented complete removal. At some time during the ensuing 16
      months, the retained fragment embolized asymptomatically to the pulmonary artery.
      During the first 2 months after the placement of a new Hickman catheter,
      progressive flow resistance developed, probably because of calcium phosphate
      precipitation, although no change had been made in the parenteral formulation. It
      resolved immediately upon the instillation of hydrochloric acid into the
      catheter.

AB  - Analysis of controlled trials from the literature shows that enteral nutrition is
      an effective treatment of active Crohn's disease. Elemental and non-elemental
      diets are both effective, and studies comparing the two types of mixtures have
      failed to reveal any significant difference. However, elemental diets appear to
      act more rapidly and have a more marked effect on the inflammatory syndrome and
      exudative enteropathy. They should therefore be preferred whenever enteral
      nutrition is used with the aim of influencing the inherent progression of Crohn's
      disease.

      treatment: a case report].
PG  - 337-41
AB  - A 20-year-old man was admitted on February 2, 1990 with the chief complaint of
      pollakisuria, miction pain and macrohematuria. Urinalysis revealed numerous
      leukocytes and Enterobacter was identified by urine culture. Cystoscopy revealed 
      an edematous region. Contrast film of small intestines demonstrated vesicoileal
      fistula. Judging from these and the radiographic findings, we made the diagnosis 
      of vesicoileal fistula with Crohn's disease. After medical therapy between
      February 22 and May 25, urinalysis became normal and we assumed that the fistula 
      had closed. Now, it is about a year since the therapy began, the patient remains 
      well, without urinary and enteric symptoms. Cystoscopy and urinalysis did not
      reveal recurrence of the fistula. Despite previous reports that vesicoenteric
      fistulas complicating Crohn's disease require surgical treatment, this case
      responded to medication, and required no surgical treatment. This case is a
      reminder of the importance of the principle of therapy.

TI  - Medical management of severe inflammatory disease of the rectum: nutritional
      aspects.
PG  - 27-41
AB  - It is clear that the nutritional state of patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease is often impaired and can be improved by the provision of nutritional
      support. Improvement in nutritional status can be achieved as effectively with
      enteral as with parenteral nutrition. Nutritional support appears to have no
      primary therapeutic effect in patients with ulcerative colitis. With regard to
      nutritional support in Crohn's disease, parenteral nutrition should be restricted
      to use as supportive rather than primary therapy. Available information now seems
      to suggest that most of the benefits of parenteral nutrition in Crohn's disease
      are related to an improvement in nutritional state rather than as primary
      therapy, and its use should be restricted to the treatment of specific
      complications of Crohn's disease, such as intestinal obstruction related to
      stricture formation or short bowel syndrome following repeated resection.
      Although some doubt exists over the efficacy of oligopeptide-containing elemental
      and polymeric enteral diets, the present evidence indicates that chemically
      defined free amino acid-containing elemental diets have primary therapeutic
      efficacy in the management of acute exacerbations of Crohn's disease. As such,
      these diets are worthy of therapeutic trial in patients with severe Crohn's
      disease involving the distal colon and rectum, particularly in those patients who
      are malnourished and who prove to be resistant to treatment with a combination of
      topical corticosteroids and 5-aminosalicylic acid-containing compounds.
      Clinicians should be aware, though, that the beneficial effects are likely to be 
      restricted to the short term, with high relapse rates by 1 year, this being
      particularly so in patients with distal Crohn's proctocolitis (Teahon et al,
      1988). Volatile fatty acid enemas clearly have potential in the management of
      patients with severe steroid-resistant proctitis. Finally, one of the most
      important observations made in recent years is the one concerning the large
      losses of nitrogen that will occur in patients with inflammatory bowel disease
      treated with corticosteroids in the absence of adequate protein intake (O'Keefe
      et al, 1989). Hopefully the days of treating patients with severe inflammatory
      bowel disease with high dose corticosteroids and a peripheral dextrose or
      dextrose-saline drip have passed into history.

PG  - 91-3
AB  - Patients with chronic gastrointestinal diseases may require long-term parenteral 
      nutrition. The authors describe a case in which a subendocardial abscess
      developed in the right atrium in association with staphylococcal septicemia. The 
      patient, a 15-year-old boy, had a malpositioned Silastic catheter, the tip of
      which was in his right atrium. Staphylococcal abscess of the heart has been
      described previously after cardiac surgery, but the authors believe this is the
      first reported case related to a central venous catheter.

TI  - Relationship of common laboratory parameters to the activity of Crohn's disease
      in children.
PG  - 216-22
AB  - The Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) has been proposed as a
      simple instrument to aid in the classification of patients by disease severity.
      The PCDAI includes subjective patient reporting of symptoms, physical
      examination, nutritional parameters, and several common laboratory tests
      (hematocrit, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, albumin). In this report we examine 
      the relationship of each of the laboratory parameters to the PCDAI, as well as to
      a modified Harvey-Bradshaw Index score and physician global assessment of disease
      activity. Data were gathered from the clinical and laboratory observations from
      133 children and adolescents at 12 pediatric gastroenterology centers in North
      America. A statistically significant relationship (p less than 0.05) was noted
      between each of the laboratory tests and the PCDAI for patients with either
      disease limited to the small bowel or in those with colonic involvement. For
      patients with disease limited to the small bowel, a statistically significant (p 
      less than 0.05) relationship was also noted between the three laboratory
      parameters and the modified Harvey-Bradshaw Index and global assessment. For
      patients with large-bowel involvement, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was
      statistically related to the modified Harvey-Bradshaw Index and global assessment
      (p less than 0.01), as was hematocrit to global assessment (p less than 0.01).
      Although the laboratory parameters used in the PCDAI appear to generally reflect 
      disease activity in most patients, no single laboratory test is adequate to
      reflect disease activity in all patients. Future work will need to identify
      additional laboratory measures to reflect the inflammatory process and serve as
      important adjuncts in the assessment of disease activity.

TI  - Remarkable improvement of growth and developmental retardation in Crohn's disease
      by parenteral and enteral nutrition therapy.
PG  - 39-43
AB  - The patient, an 18-yr-old male (admission ht 153 cm, wt 30 kg), had been
      suffering from growth arrest and intermittent abdominal pain since he was 13 yr
      old, which was left untreated. Examinations on admission disclosed almost normal 
      pituitary function, while levels of testosterone and somatomedin C were low.
      Roentgenological examination revealed extensive skip-stenotic lesions and
      longitudinal ulcers in the ileum, diagnostic of Crohn's disease. Therapy
      involving high-caloric parenteral and enteral alimentation resulted in a marked
      increase in both ht and wt, and improvement in roentgenological and
      colonoscopical findings. The interrelation between Crohn's disease and
      malnutrition with reference to some reports in the literature is discussed.

TI  - [Bacterial translocation in Crohn disease].
PG  - 777-81
AB  - Bacterial translocation is the passage of viable endogenous bacteria from the
      gastrointestinal tract to mesenteric lymph nodes and other internal organs. The
      aim of this work was to study bacterial translocation in patients operated on for
      Crohn's disease. Twenty-eight patients, mean age 29 years, not having received
      any antibiotics since at least 8 days, presenting with ileal (n = 12),
      ileo-colonic (n = 14) or colonic (n = 2) Crohn's disease were studied. In 25 out 
      of 28 cases (89%) indication for surgery was strictures inducing an upper small
      bowel distension in 9 out of 25 patients. Mesenteric lymph nodes and liver
      biopsies, portal blood samples and peritoneum swabs were harvested after
      laparotomy and before gut opening. Bacterial translocation, defined as the
      presence of intestinal bacteria in at least one of the specimens, was present in 
      8 out of 28 patients. This was found in lymph nodes draining surgical territories
      in 7 out of 8 cases. Bacterial strains involved in translocation included E. coli
      (n = 5), Enterococcus (n = 3), Clostridium perfringens (n = 2), Proteus (n = 2), 
      and Bacteroides fragilis (n = 1). The rate of translocation differed neither
      according to Crohn's disease site nor with perforating or non perforating type of
      the disease. Five out of 9 patients operated on for strictures with proximal
      distension had a translocation. In conclusion, bacterial translocation was
      identified in 29% of patients operated on for Crohn's disease in this series.
      Distension of the intestine proximal to a digestive stricture could favor the
      occurrence of bacterial translocation in Crohn's disease.

TI  - Nutritional support in inflammatory bowel disease: current status and future
      directions.
PG  - 117-22
AB  - Malnutrition is a frequent occurrence in patients with acute inflammatory bowel
      disease. Total nutritional support provided either parentally (TPN) or enterally 
      (TEN) has been advocated not only as an adjunct for improving nutrition but also 
      as primary therapy. For patients with acute Crohn's disease, short-term rates of 
      remission after TEN are equivalent to TPN. Coupled with certain advantages when
      compared with TPN, including simpler administration, fewer side effects, and
      preservation of the intestinal mucosal barrier, TEN may therefore be the
      preferred route for nutrient delivery. Controlled trials indicate equivalent or
      superior efficacy when enteral polymeric diets are compared with elemental diets 
      for inducing remission in acute Crohn's disease. Moreover, when provided as an
      elemental diet, TEN is as effective as corticosteroids for achieving remission in
      acute Crohn's disease, but corticosteroids appear to be more effective than
      polymeric diets. Although the provision of nutritional support rather than bowel 
      rest is the major factor contributing to symptomatic improvement, the optimal
      nutrient composition and the precise mechanisms whereby nutritional support
      achieves clinical remission remain to be clarified. In contrast to Crohn's
      disease, nutritional support is not effective for achieving remission in patients
      with ulcerative colitis. Thus, enteral nutritional support is an effective
      therapy for the short-term management of acute Crohn's disease. Whether long-term
      remission is equivalent to treatment with drugs or surgery requires prospective
      evaluation. Future avenues of investigation also include defining the optimal
      nutrient composition and the underlying mechanisms that achieve maximal
      nutritional repletion, promote mucosal cell renewal, and potentially directly
      retard production of inflammatory mediators.

TI  - Malnutrition in Crohn's disease: substrate deficiency or misuse?
PG  - 76-8
AB  - Growth failure is frequently associated with Crohn's disease. However, it does
      not seem to be fully accounted for by overt endocrinological abnormalities or
      nutrient deficiencies. It may be related to an abnormal utilization of available 
      substrates, particularly proteins, due to an imbalance in protein metabolism
      kinetics. Its primary mechanism may be an increase in protein breakdown rates
      over synthesis, specifically related to the associated inflammatory syndrome, and
      progressively leading to a protein debt. Reduction in food intake would only
      exaggerate this trend by further reducing the synthesis to breakdown ratio,
      whereas nutrient supplementation merely compensates for the deficit by promoting 
      protein synthesis.

AB  - Thirty-eight children presenting with severe Crohn's disease (CD) were studied
      retrospectively over a mean period of 6 years. The severity of CD was estimated
      according to an activity score. This was initially 66 +/- 19 reaching 100 in 16% 
      of cases. Initial involvement included ileon and large intestine only (n = 23),
      large intestine (n = 11) and ileon only (n = 4), with upper GI tract or perineal 
      involvement in 32 and 75% of cases respectively. The treatments consisted of
      corticosteroids (n = 34), azathioprine (n = 11), continuous enteral feeding (CEF)
      (n = 25), parenteral nutrition (PN) (n = 30). Mean recurrence rates per patient
      and per year were 0.6 in the groups including ileon and large intestine or the
      large intestine only and 0.3 in the ileal group. A surgical resection was
      performed in 20 cases with a mean rate of reoperation of 40% at 5 years.
      Reoperations were necessary only in the group involving the ileon and large
      intestine. Mean weight catch-up in 3 months and height growth speed were 6 kg and
      1.7 to 3.1 cm/year under CED and/or PN. After a 6 year follow-up the activity
      index was decreased by 70% with a quality of life considered to be good in 60% of
      cases.

TI  - Controlled trial comparing two types of enteral nutrition in treatment of active 
      Crohn's disease: elemental versus polymeric diet.
PG  - 1492-7
AB  - To determine whether an elemental diet or a polymeric defined formula diet would 
      be more effective for treating active Crohn's disease, we conducted a prospective
      randomised clinical trial in 30 patients with active Crohn's disease unresponsive
      to steroids and/or complicated by malnutrition. They received a four to six week 
      enteral nutrition course with either an elemental diet or a polymeric diet.
      Clinical remission occurred in 10 of the 15 patients on elemental diet compared
      with 11 of the 15 patients assigned to polymeric diet. Both groups showed similar
      improvements in nutritional status, biological inflammation, alpha 1 antitrypsin 
      clearance, and colonoscopic lesions (diminished in 17 out of 24 patients). Most
      patients relapsed during the year after discharge. We conclude that enteral
      nutrition, whatever the diet, is an efficient primary therapy for active Crohn's 
      disease but does not influence the long term outcome.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease. Part II: Clinical and therapeutic aspects.
PG  - 669-746
AB  - Once regarded as medical curiosities, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease have
      achieved a remarkable change in status recently and today are among the more
      compelling of all human illnesses. The cause(s) of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) are not known. Genetic, environmental, microbial, and immunologic factors
      are involved, but the precise mechanisms are obscure. The incidence of ulcerative
      colitis is relatively stable, while Crohn's disease continues to increase in
      frequency. In 10% to 15% of patients, it is hard to differentiate between
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn's colitis, however, problems with diagnosis usually 
      resolve with time and repeated examinations. In part I of his two-part monograph 
      on IBD, Dr. Kirsner addressed the nature and pathogenesis of the disease.
      Increased study of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in recent years has
      generated new knowledge regarding their etiology. Part I focused on microbial,
      immunologic, and genetic mechanisms of, and the inflammatory process involved in 
      the disease. In this part, Dr. Kirsner deals with the clinical features, course, 
      and management of IBD, based on the author's 55 years of experience with these
      problems and supplemented by critical examination of the recent (1988-1990)
      literature. Particular attention is directed to the symptoms and physical
      findings of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. The laboratory, radiologic,
      endoscopic, and pathologic features, and the many systemic complications. IBDs
      are mimicked by several enterocolonic infections and other conditions making
      differential diagnosis necessary. Inflammatory bowel disease in children and the 
      elderly conforms to conventional clinical patterns modified by the health
      circumstances of the respective age groups. Because the cause of IBD has not been
      established, current medical therapy is facilitative and supportive rather than
      curative. The principles of medical treatment are approximately the same for
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Treatment emphasizes a program rather
      than a drug and also considers the individuality of the therapeutic response. A
      clearer understanding of dietary and nutritional needs, including
      hyperalimentation and electrolyte and fluid balance, aids treatment.
      Antidiarrheal and antispasmodal preparation and sedatives are prescribed for
      symptom relief. The bowel inflammation is controlled with sulfasalazine or the
      newer 5-amino-salicylic acid (5-ASA) compounds, antibacterial drugs for
      complications of Crohn's disease and IBD, adrenocortical steroids, and the
      immunosuppressive compounds 6-mercaptopurine (6MP), azathioprine, and
      cyclosporine, as determined in each patient. The surgical procedures available
      for treatment of ulcerative colitis include total proctocolectomy and ileostomy
      or ileoanal anastomosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

TI  - Metabolism of vitamin A in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 391-5
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine serum retinol levels in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease and to attempt to elucidate the mechanism of changes
      in vitamin A metabolism in these disorders. It was found that in 15 patients with
      active ulcerative colitis, 14 patients with active Crohn's disease and in 3
      operated patients with recurrent Crohn's disease serum retinol levels and
      retinol-binding protein were significantly lower than in controls. Concentrations
      of vitamin A did not depend on the localization of inflammatory bowel disease,
      previous ileal resections, duration of the disease or age and sex of the
      patients. During successful treatment of active ulcerative colitis normalization 
      of serum retinol levels without substitution of vitamin A was observed. Repeated 
      determinations in patients with Crohn's disease who had low serum retinol levels 
      in an active phase of disease revealed normal vitamin A levels in an inactive
      phase. The absorption of vitamins A and E in patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease was normal. The normal serum retinol concentrations in patients with
      diarrhea due to irritable bowel syndrome, and in those with anorexia nervosa
      exclude the influence of diarrhea and body weight itself on vitamin A levels. The
      results of this study indicate that serum retinol levels in patients with active 
      inflammatory bowel disease are secondary to the decreased serum retinol-binding
      protein concentrations, and probably depend on the increased protein catabolism
      in these disorders.

AB  - In a prospective study the effect on cell-mediated immunity (Merieux-Multitest), 
      nutritional state and parameters of inflammation was compared in conservatively
      (n = 21) and surgically (n = 20) treated patients with Crohn's disease. Before
      therapy both groups showed a significantly lower immune response compared with
      healthy controls. The therapeutical effect was similar in both groups concerning 
      normalization of parameters of inflammation, CDAI and state of nutrition. In
      contrast, normalization of immune response in skin test was only observed after
      bowel resection, while conservatively treated patients remained in hyperergy. In 
      conclusion, the impairment of the cell mediated immunity in Crohn's disease must 
      be secondary. Excluding patients with steroid therapy there was no correlation
      between preoperative annergy or hyperergy and postoperative complications.

TI  - Comparison of enteral nutrition and drug treatment in active Crohn's disease.
      Results of the European Cooperative Crohn's Disease Study. IV.
PG  - 881-8
AB  - This study compared the effect of enteral nutrition as the sole therapy of active
      Crohn's disease with drug treatment. Patients with active Crohn's disease
      (Crohn's Disease Activity Index greater than 200) were randomized to receive
      either enteral nutrition with a liquid oligopeptide diet (n = 55) or a
      combination of 6-methylprednisolone, 48 mg daily, subsequently tapered, and
      sulfasalazine, 3 g daily (n = 52). The two groups were not different with respect
      to age, sex, body weight, location of disease, or treatment before the study. The
      severity of disease was similar at the beginning of the study in both groups
      [Crohn's Disease Activity Index (mean +/- SEM), 323 +/- 12 vs. 316 +/- 11].
      Remission was defined as a decrease of the initial Crohn's Disease Activity Index
      by 40% or at least 100 points. Twenty-nine patients in the diet group and 41
      patients in the drug group reached remission within 6 weeks of therapy (chi 2
      test, P less than 0.01). The median elapsed time to remission was 30.7 days in
      the diet group compared with 8.2 days in the drug group (Mantel Cox, P less than 
      0.01). To determine whether one of these treatments was more beneficial for a
      subgroup of patients, the effectiveness of both treatments was analyzed
      separately in patients with very severe disease (initial Crohn's Disease Activity
      Index greater than 300) and less severe disease (initial Crohn's Disease Activity
      Index less than 300), and in patients with different disease location. However,
      no influence of initial disease activity or disease location on the effect of
      either treatment could be shown. These data show that enteral nutrition is less
      effective than a combination of 6-methylprednisolone and sulfasalazine in
      treating active Crohn's disease.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of fasting, self-selected meals and isocaloric
      oral glucose and fat meals and intravenous (i.v.) feeding on plasma zinc
      concentrations in men. Plasma zinc remained stable when volunteers fasted all
      day, but self-selected meals and 600 kCal of dextrose or fat emulsion caused
      significantly reduced plasma zinc concentrations [mean (SD) 12.1 (1.4), 12.3
      (0.6) and 12.2 (0.7) mumol/L at 1400 h, respectively, compared with a fasting
      level of 13.9 (1.6) mumol/L at 0800 h, P less than 0.05]. In patients undergoing 
      intravenous hyperalimentation, plasma zinc decreased from 12.0 (1.4) mumol/L at
      0800 h to 10.0 (1.1) mumol/L at 1400 h [mean (SD), P less than 0.01]. These data 
      show that both enteral and i.v. feeding cause a decline in plasma zinc and that
      glucose alone is not responsible for this post-prandial fall since ingestion of
      isocaloric amounts of glucose or fat have a similar effect.

TI  - Serum concentrations of tumour necrosis factor alpha in childhood chronic
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 913-7
AB  - Serum tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) concentrations were measured by
      enzyme linked immunoadsorbent assay in 31 normal children and during 65 episodes 
      of clinical remission and 54 episodes of relapse in 92 children with chronic
      inflammatory bowel disease. An appreciable rise in TNF alpha was found only in
      children in relapse of ulcerative colitis and colonic Crohn's disease. The group 
      of children with small bowel Crohn's disease in relapse did not show increases of
      TNF alpha above control concentrations, despite an equivalent rise in disease
      indices. Height velocity was depressed in children with relapse of large bowel
      Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis compared with the equivalent condition in 
      remission. The impairment of growth velocity was significantly greater in relapse
      of large bowel Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis than in small bowel Crohn's
      disease alone, although for the subgroups in stage 1 puberty (prepubertal) the
      differences were not significant. Inadequate growth in chronic inflammatory bowel
      disease is currently ascribed to inadequate nutrition and TNF alpha may
      contribute to this through its cachexia inducing effects. It may, in addition,
      diminish pituitary growth hormone release. These results suggest that production 
      of TNF alpha may be associated with growth failure in relapse of colonic
      inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Four years of North American registry home parenteral nutrition outcome data and 
      their implications for patient management.
PG  - 384-93
AB  - The OASIS Registry started annual collection of longitudinal data on patients on 
      home parenteral nutrition (HPN) in 1984. This report describes outcome profiles
      on 1594 HPN patients in seven disease categories. Analysis showed clinical
      outcome was principally a reflection of the underlying diagnosis. Patients with
      Crohn's disease, ischemic bowel disease, motility disorders, radiation enteritis,
      and congenital bowel dysfunction all had a fairly long-term clinical outcome,
      whereas those with active cancer and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)
      had a short-term outcome. The long-term group had a 3-year survival rate of 65 to
      80%, they averaged 2.6 complications requiring hospitalization per year, and 49% 
      experienced complete rehabilitation. The short-term group had a mean survival of 
      6 months; they averaged 4.6 complications per year and about 15% experienced
      complete rehabilitation. The registry data also indicated HPN was used for 19,700
      patients in 1987 with therapy growth averaging about 8% per year. This growth was
      chiefly from new cancer patients. The number of new patients with long-term
      disorders in whom HPN was initiated appeared rather constant. We conclude that
      these clinical outcome assessments justify HPN for long-term patients, but the
      utility and appropriateness of HPN for the cancer and AIDS patients remains
      uncertain and requires further study. Medical, social, and fiscal aspects of HPN 
      management in long-term and short-term patients appear to involve quite separate 
      considerations.

TI  - Review article: dietary and nutritional management of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 211-26
AB  - The value of dietary alteration and the nutritional management of Crohn's disease
      is assessed in this review. Lactose restriction, low-fat diets and low-residue
      diets may be of value in specifically indicated clinical situations. A
      fibre-rich, unrefined carbohydrate diet has not been shown to alter the course of
      the disease, and the value of 'exclusion diets' remains to be confirmed in
      controlled, prospective studies. Nutritional insufficiency of varying degrees is 
      common in Crohn's disease and can be corrected by the efficient use of enteral
      diets (usually with polymeric preparations) or intravenous nutritional support.
      Growth retardation in adolescents with Crohn's disease can usually be improved by
      enteral nutrition. Nutritional support of various kinds may be of value in the
      management of local complications of Crohn's disease; sub-acute obstruction,
      anal, perianal and rectal lesions, fistulas and ileostomy complications, and the 
      management of bile acid-induced diarrhoea. The use of nutrition as 'primary
      therapy; in Crohn's disease is considered. Theoretical reasons why nutritional
      support and bowel rest may possibly induce remission of the disease are
      discussed. The evidence to date suggests that intravenous nutrition and bowel
      rest may not be effective in inducing a primary remission of the disease, and the
      possible value of elemental diets and polymeric diets in this respect are
      assessed. Further prospective controlled studies of elemental diets as primary

TI  - Enteral feeding as sole treatment for Crohn's disease: controlled trial of whole 
      protein v amino acid based feed and a case study of dietary challenge.
PG  - 702-7
AB  - A controlled trial was performed to compare enteral feeding with either an amino 
      acid based feed or a whole protein feed as sole treatment for active Crohn's
      disease. Twenty four patients were studied (nine with ileal, 11 with ileocolonic,
      and four with colonic disease). Both feeds proved effective; nine of 13 patients 
      randomised to receive the amino acid based feed were in clinical remission within
      three weeks as defined by a simple activity index compared with eight of 11
      treated with the whole protein feed. Patients in clinical remission were then
      crossed over onto the other feed. None of the six patients who were changed to
      the whole protein feed relapsed over the subsequent three week period compared
      with three of seven patients who were changed to the amino acid based feed. In
      responders the median serum C reactive protein concentration fell from 21 mg/l
      (range 9-82) on entry to 6 mg/l (range 3-19) at six weeks. Seven patients
      relapsed within eight months of starting solid food (mean 3.7 months), while nine
      were still in remission (follow up period 3-9 months, median six months).
      Detailed studies of staged reintroduction of food and permitted food additives
      were carried out over a four year period in a patient with extensive stricturing 
      small bowel Crohn's disease who had been brought into remission by open treatment
      with enteral feeding. Carrageenan, other permitted emulsifiers, bread, meat,
      potatoes, oranges, refined sugar, dairy produce, flour, and rice were all
      reintroduced without any objective ill effect, but green vegetables provoked a
      clinical and biochemical relapse within one week of introduction. Remission was
      rapidly achieved by switching back to the enteral feed but reintroduction of the 
      low residue diet that had been previously tolerated produced a brisk relapse.
      Clinical and biochemical remission was again achieved by a return to the enteral 
      feed but relapse again occurred with reintroduction of the low residue diet.
      These studies confirm the therapeutic effect of enteral feeding in Crohn's
      disease. This effect does not seem to be due to avoidance of whole protein, but
      the very low residue of chemically defined enteral feeds may be important,
      particularly in patients with intestinal strictures.

TI  - The influence of zinc status and malnutrition on immunological function in
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1616-25
AB  - Cellular immunity is likely to be important in the pathogenesis of Crohn's
      disease; whether it is abnormal is not clear. The heterogeneity of patients with 
      Crohn's disease probably underlies the disparity of reports, but attempts to
      determine which clinical features influence cellular immunity have been largely
      unsuccessful. This is probably caused by the omission of nutritional status as a 
      potential factor, even though zinc deficiency has frequently been linked with
      abnormal immunity. Therefore, a detailed study of nutritional and tissue zinc
      status, nonspecific cellular immunity, and a measure of phagocytic function was
      performed in 32 patients with Crohn's disease and in a control group of 18 normal
      subjects and 12 patients with anorexia nervosa. Fourteen patients with Crohn's
      disease, all patients with anorexia nervosa, but none of the normal controls were
      malnourished. Peripheral blood lymphocyte population levels were normal in
      patients with Crohn's disease and in normal controls, but there was a small
      decrease in the levels of patients with anorexia nervosa. In vivo delayed
      hypersensitivity skin test responses were profoundly depressed in patients with
      anorexia nervosa and decreased in patients with Crohn's disease who were
      malnourished or receiving systemic glucocorticoids. In vitro lymphocyte
      transformation was reduced in malnourished patients with Crohn's disease, but
      there were only minor changes in patients with anorexia nervosa. There were
      alterations of in vitro immunoregulation in Crohn's disease, but they were not
      responsible for the abnormal lymphocyte transformation responses in malnourished 
      patients. In vitro phagocytic function was reduced in patients with active
      Crohn's disease. These findings suggest that depressed in vivo and in vitro
      cellular immunity in malnourished patients with Crohn's disease is caused by a
      qualitative lymphocyte defect and that depressed in vivo but normal in vitro
      cellular immunity in anorexia nervosa is caused by a quantitative defect. Thus,
      malnutrition in Crohn's disease resembles kwashiorkor; in anorexia nervosa, it
      resembles marasmus. Tissue zinc status was mostly normal in Crohn's disease and
      anorexia nervosa, and zinc deficiency was not responsible for depressed
      nonspecific cellular immunity in either condition.

OAB - In view of the significant and articulate minority view among pediatricians that 
      breast feeding is not "worth the bother" in developed countries, this review of
      the literature delves into the evidence from both developed and developing
      countries for the advantages of breastfeeding, both in infants and for long-term 
      health. Infants in developed settings experience twice the hospitalization rate
      and more severe illness from lower respiratory tract infection, primarily
      respiratory syncytial virus. In developing countries the mortality risk is
      4-fold. for otitis media, the relative risks were 3.3-4.3 for Finnish infants.
      Bacterial meningitis and/or bacteremia had a 4-fold risk for hospitalization in a
      Connecticut study, and a 3-fold relative risk in 2 developing country studies.
      Human milk was the best preventative for bacteremia and necrotizing enterocolitis
      in prematures in British neonatal units. A 20-fold reduction in neonatal deaths
      occurred in Philippine study of breastfeeding, especially in low birth weight
      babies. Diarrhea causes the most infant mortality in developing nations, where
      bottle-feeding raises rates 14-fold. In the U.S. estimated relative risks is 3.7 
      for diarrheal mortality. Sudden infant death is about 1/5 less common in U.S.
      breast fed babies than in bottle fed. There is evidence for better long-term
      health after breast feeding in disorders such as celiac disease, Crohn disease,
      ulcerative colitis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease,
      malignant lymphoma, chronic liver disease, atopic dermatitis, and food allergies.
      The design of good studies of protection conferred by breast feeding, and the
      possible modes of action of breast milk are discussed.

TI  - Influence of rapid amino acid and lipid emulsion administration on gas exchange
      and resting energy expenditure.
PG  - 200-3; discussion 203-4
AB  - The aim of this study was to observe the effect of rapid lipid and amino acid
      infusion on resting energy expenditure (REE) in patients on parenteral nutrition.
      Eight people were studied. After 8 h of saline administration, they received 20% 
      lipid emulsion and 8% amino acid solution during the next 5 h (rate 3.8
      mg.kg-1.min-1 fat and 1.9 mg.kg-1.min-1 amino acid). Before the onset of the
      infusion and 3 and 5 h after, gas exchange and REE were measured. The rapid lipid
      emulsion administration led to a significant rise in serum triglyceride level. A 
      significant increase in VO2 (from 269.0 +/- 66.8 to 319 +/- 55.8 ml/min) and REE 
      (from 1858 +/- 438 to 2155 +/- 385 kcal/24 h) was observed 5 h after the onset of
      substrate administration (P less than 0.01). Pulmonary ventilation and VCO2
      production were not influenced by the infusion. The thermic effect of nutrients
      administered reached 3.5 and 6.5% 3 and 5 h after the start of infusion,
      respectively. We conclude that REE can be increased by the rapid administration
      of lipid-based parenteral nutrition.

TI  - Pitfall in diagnosis of Crohn's disease in a cystic fibrosis patient.
PG  - 369-71
AB  - Cystic fibrosis (CF) and Crohn's disease may both present as failure to thrive
      and recurrent intestinal obstruction. Proper treatment and adequate nutrition may
      reverse these manifestations and improve the patient's quality of life. We
      describe a girl with CF who, despite appropriate management, failed to grow and
      had several episodes of bowel obstruction. After the additional diagnosis of
      Crohn's disease was reached, the patient improved on antiinflammatory and
      nutritional therapy. This patient illustrates the pitfall in the diagnosis of
      Crohn's disease in a CF patient due to the clinical overlap between the two
      conditions. We suggest that therapeutic failure in a chronic disease justifies
      additional diagnostic efforts resulting in a completion of diagnosis and
      significant changes in management.

TI  - Hepatic metabolism of cholesterol in Crohn's disease. Effect of partial resection
      of ileum.
PG  - 1046-53
AB  - To study cholesterol metabolism in Crohn's disease and especially the effect of
      ileum resection, liver biopsy specimens were obtained from patients undergoing
      partial ileal resection because of Crohn's disease (n = 17) and patients with
      Crohn's colitis undergoing colectomy (n = 3). Gallstone-free patients (n = 16)
      undergoing cholecystectomy because of adenomyomas or polyps of the gallbladder
      served as controls. The mean levels of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity
      and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity, rate-determining
      enzymes in bile acid, and cholesterol synthesis, respectively, were twofold to
      threefold higher in the ileum-resected patients than in the controls. Significant
      positive correlations were obtained between length of resected ileum and
      cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity. Provided patients who had received
      total parenteral nutrition preoperatively were excluded from analysis, a
      significant correlation was also observed between length of resected ileum and
      3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity. Significant positive
      correlations were also obtained between length of resected ileum and serum levels
      of 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol (a marker for bile acid biosynthesis) and
      lathosterol (a marker for cholesterol synthesis). The plasma levels of total and 
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were negatively correlated to the length of
      resected ileum. The expression of hepatic low-density lipoprotein-receptor
      binding activity was determined in five of the patients and in three of the
      controls. A significant positive correlation was observed between
      3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity and low-density
      lipoprotein-receptor binding activity. The results show that malabsorption of
      bile acids leads to parallel stimulation of cholesterol synthesis, cholesterol
      degradation, and low-density lipoprotein-receptor expression in human liver. The 
      resulting effect in the present patients was a significant reduction in
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

TI  - Long-term effects of elemental and exclusion diets for Crohn's disease.
PG  - 115-25
AB  - Previous studies have confirmed the therapeutic value of elemental diets in
      promoting remission in active Crohn's disease, but their long-term benefit has
      not been established. Twenty-seven patients with established Crohn's disease who 
      attained clinical remission after four weeks of enteral feeding were followed
      prospectively for up to 36 months. Twenty of these were willing to be tested for 
      specific food intolerance using a pre-defined dietary elimination protocol; the
      others continued on a normal unrestricted diet. Eighteen patients (67%) have
      since relapsed; 89% of the relapse occurred within the first 6 months. Of the 15 
      patients with colonic involvement, 12 (80%) relapsed by 6 months. In contrast
      only 3 of 11 with isolated small bowel disease experienced early relapse. Of the 
      14 patients who completed the process of dietary testing, 5 could not identify
      any trigger foods; the remaining 9 were maintained on exclusion diets, 3 of whom 
      relapsed early. Of the 11 taking a normal diet, 9 relapsed. Disease duration,
      previous intestinal resection or prior steroid therapy did not affect the relapse
      rate. Eight patients (31%) obtained a long-term remission, mean 23 months (range 
      12-36 months), without any medication. Long-lasting remissions can be obtained in
      about one-third of patients with Crohn's disease following treatment with a
      defined formula diet. Colonic involvement is associated with a high early relapse
      rate.

TI  - Nutritional support in Crohn's disease: which route?
PG  - 317-21
AB  - Nutritional and clinical responses to three nutritional regimens were
      retrospectively evaluated in 81 Crohn's patients with active disease. Group 1 (n 
      = 42) received a low residue oral diet, group 2 (n = 15) received chemically
      defined diets, and group 3 (n = 24), parenteral nutrition (PN). Weight gain was
      observed in a similar percentage of patients, whereas serum albumin increase was 
      significant only in group 3: 3.15 +/- 0.66 versus 3.54 +/- 0.61 g/100 ml (p less 
      than 0.05). Mean activity index decreased significantly in all groups (p less
      than 0.001), and length of stay in hospital was similar. Patients with intestinal
      obstruction had a better immediate response when submitted to PN: clinical
      remission was achieved in 75% of those in group 3, but in only 50% in groups 1
      and 2 (p less than 0.05). Otherwise, short- and long-term outcome was similar.

TI  - [Treatment of Crohn disease].
PG  - 433-8
AB  - Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the bowel for which there is
      no curative treatment. The purpose of treatment is to reduce mortality to the
      absolute minimum and to give the patients a normal quality of life. Acute
      episodes of low severity are treated with sulfasalazine and its most recent
      derivatives such as 5-aminosalicylate. More severe episodes require oral
      corticosteroid therapy which, when prescribed in adequate doses, results in
      clinical remission in over 90% of the cases. To this must be added parenteral
      nutrition in patients with very severe symptoms or when a major nutritional
      deficit is present. During remissions, a maintenance treatment with
      5-aminosalicylate or azathioprine is justified when the acute episodes are
      frequent and/or severe. These continuous chronic forms require prolonged low-dose
      corticosteroid therapy or azathioprine. Artificial nutrition is the best way of
      treating corticosteroid-resistant episodes. In children, corticosteroids must be 
      avoided as much as possible, and low-flow rate enteral nutrition is often used as
      primary treatment of salicylate-resistant episodes. The surgical treatment of
      Crohn's disease consists of resection of the lesions with anastomosis or
      ileostomy in case of total proctocolectomy. Following resection-anastomosis, the 
      cumulative relapse rate is about 50% ten years after surgery; it is lower after
      colostomy and proctocolectomy. Surgery is indicated in case of complications
      (abscesses, stenosis, fistulae, perforation) and when the disease does not
      respond to a well-conducted medical treatment. Specialized teams including
      physicians, surgeons, proctologists and specialists in nutrition are essential to
      a correct treatment of Crohn's disease.

TI  - [Qualitative study of fecal alpha-1-antitrypsin in patients with inflammatory
      digestive disease and patients with ileostomy].
PG  - 301-5
AB  - Alpha-1-antitrypsin is a glycoprotein which is excreted in feces under three
      different forms of molecular weight 38, 45 and 51 kDa. The 45 and 38 kDa forms
      are the result of a partial or total removal of the carbohydrate moiety,
      respectively. We determined the molecular forms of fecal alpha-1-antitrypsin in
      10 controls, 13 patients with protein-losing enteropathy other than inflammatory 
      bowel disease, 70 patients with active (n = 55) (CDAI greater than 150) and
      inactive (n = 15) (CDAI less than 150) Crohn's disease, 14 patients with active
      (n = 12) and inactive (n = 2) ulcerative colitis, and 17 patients with ileostomy.
      Fecal 38 kDa alpha-1-antitrypsin was found in all controls, all patients with
      protein-losing enteropathy, in 82 percent of patients with inactive inflammatory 
      bowel disease, and in 20 percent of patients with active inflammatory bowel
      disease. In contrast, the 51 kDa and 45 kDa forms were present in feces of 80
      percent of patients with active inflammatory bowel disease, and in only 17
      percent of patients with inactive inflammatory bowel disease. Patients with
      Crohn's disease and the 51 kDa form (n = 39) had significantly higher values of
      activity index (CDAI) and orosomucoid than patients with Crohn's disease and the 
      38 kDa form (n = 26) (P less than 0.01). Deglycosylated 38 kDa
      alpha-1-antitrypsin was never recovered in ileostomy samples. This suggests that 
      deglycosylation of alpha-1-antitrypsin occurred in the colon and is impaired in
      patients with active inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Risks of intestinal anastomoses in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 37-42
AB  - Six hundred fifty-eight intestinal anastomoses in 429 operations for Crohn's
      disease were studied prospectively during an 8-year period to detect variables
      connected with perioperative morbidity. Postoperative complications occurred in
      9.7% of the patients, 4% had to be reoperated on, and the overall mortality rate 
      was 0.5%. In multivariate analysis by stepwise logistic regression, the only
      variable significantly (p = 0.03) associated with overall rate of complications
      was long-term corticosteroid therapy. Serious complications were more common in
      cases of intra-abdominal abscesses (p = 0.01) and preoperative steroid medication
      (p = 0.03). The combination of both of these risk factors increased the rate of
      reoperations from 0.6% (no steroids, no abscess) to 16% (steroids and abscess).
      No significant association with postoperative complications could be found for
      age, sex, duration of disease, previous operations, nutritional status, emergency
      surgery, extent of disease, type, number, and localization of anastomoses,
      presence of proximal ileo-/colostomy, or histologically inflamed margins of
      resection.

TI  - [What is the role of nutrition in Crohn disease? A contribution to the importance
      of dietary therapy in regional enteritis].
PG  - 238-46
AB  - The clinical appearance of Crohn's disease (CD) is especially marked by
      nutritional deficits and insufficiencies. For a long time the goal of nutritional
      care was reduced to the readjustment of the nutritional status. The development
      and clinical use of controlled parenteral nutrition (TPN) and enteral nutritive
      solutions (EN) did not only emphasize this therapeutical issue, but furthermore
      showed positive effects on the conservative as well as on the surgical treatment 
      concepts. Therefore today artificial nutritional support is a firm part of
      therapy in acute, active phases or in the contact of surgical management of CD.
      This is especially valid in children, where complications in general and growth
      failure in particular can be reduced. EN is the preferred feeding method in most 
      of the cases, due to a lower complication rate and reduced cost when compared to 
      TPN. The question regarding the importance of nutritional support as primary
      therapy has also been investigated. The results differ extensively, but point
      towards the conclusion that patients with solitary small bowel disease do profit 
      from this therapeutical concept. Nevertheless it is unclear, how TPN or EN
      interfere in the pathophysiology or -biochemistry in this process. A question
      about reduction e.g. of allergic components of daily diet did stimulate new
      theories regarding the hypothesis of a possible causal relationship between diet 
      and the pathogenesis of CD. Investigations on dietary habits and daily dietary
      therapy did not reveal an overall accepted dietary guideline. Nevertheless it
      seems obvious that dietary counselling has a positive effect on the disease
      process. It does appear, that today in the acute, active phase as well as in the 
      long term management of Crohn's disease nutritional-care is an important
      therapeutical method.

TI  - The nutritional consequences of gastrointestinal disease in adolescence.
PG  - 91-102
AB  - The growth spurt of adolescence, during which body weight nearly doubles and
      height increases by 16%, demands an increased delivery of nutrients by the
      gastrointestinal tract. Chronic disorders of digestion and absorption at this
      age, therefore have a potentially profound effect upon growth, skeletal
      maturation and sexual development. Moreover, the emotional climate of
      adolescence, which requires affiliation with peer groups, and a distancing from
      authority figures such as doctors and parents, is often associated with a
      deterioration in drug and dietary compliance and with erratic clinic attendance. 
      Nutritional problems in adolescent patients with Crohn's disease, cystic fibrosis
      and coeliac disease are the most common. About one third of adolescents with
      Crohn's disease experience growth failure and delayed sexual development,
      probably as a consequence of long-term undernutrition. There is a strong argument
      for the care of these patients being in the hands of paediatric
      gastroenterologists. Enteral nutrition, often administered overnight, is
      successful in inducing catch-up growth, and reducing steroid dosage, although
      resection of diseased gut is often followed by good growth, and surgery should
      not be overlooked. Cystic fibrosis in adolescence is commonly complicated by
      protein-energy malnutrition. Pathogenesis includes anorexia, maldigestion and an 
      increase in resting energy expenditure. Malnutrition has been treated by a number
      of enteral regimens. In general, there is no place for repeated, short-term
      interventions of less than 6 months. Long-term studies have all shown good
      nutritional repletion and growth, but results with respect to improved
      respiratory function are conflicting. More prospective control trials are needed 
      before the precise indications for enteral nutrition in cystic fibrosis can be
      accurately defined. Once started it is difficult to stop, although preoperative
      treatment of patients awaiting heart-lung transplantation seems entirely
      appropriate. The major problem in the management of coeliac disease in
      adolescence is dietary compliance. Even those patients who claim to have good
      dietary compliance often have jejunal biopsy evidence of gluten ingestion and
      tend to be underweight. This is particularly worrying, as after 5 years adherence
      to a gluten free diet, the increased risk of gastrointestinal malignancy appears 
      to return to normal.

AB  - What possible treatments are there for inflammatory intestinal diseases, and on
      what scientific grounds do we treat these patients? A survey shows that the
      considerable decline in mortality which has occurred as regards ulcerous colitis 
      ensued rather via trial and error than as a result of regular clinical tests.

TI  - Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome of nonalcoholic origin.
PG  - 69-82
AB  - We describe a patient who developed a severe loss of memory following intravenous
      feeding and intestinal surgery. The pattern of both anterograde and retrograde
      memory impairment and frontal pathology is shown to be comparable with that
      observed in patients with Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome of an alcoholic etiology.
      The data strengthen the view that the essential characteristics of the
      Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome are not dependent on a prior history of chronic
      alcoholism. Implications of these data for the interpretation of alcoholic
      Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome are considered.
