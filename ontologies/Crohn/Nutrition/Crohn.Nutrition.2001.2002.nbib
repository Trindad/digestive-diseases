TI  - [The role of nutritional status on serum immunoglobulins, body weight and
      postoperative infectious-related complications in patients with Crohn's disease
      receiving perioperative parenteral nutrition].
PG  - 181-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of nutritional status on serum immunoglobulins,
      body weight and postoperative infectious-related complications in patients with
      Crohn's disease receiving perioperative parenteral nutrition (PN). METHODS: 32
      patients with Crohn's disease receiving perioperative parenteral nutrition in our
      department between 1984 and 1994 were enrolled in this survey. 16 patients with
      loss of body weight in the range of 15%-30% were assigned to the malnutrition
      group, the other 16 patients with normal weight or loss of body weight less than 
      15% to the control group. Serum IgM, IgG and IgA levels were measured before and 
      after PN by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Liver function, body weight
      changes and postoperative complications were also analyzed. RESULTS: IgM levels
      were elevated before PN in both groups [control group: (133 +/- 16) mg/dl,
      malnutrition group: (139 +/- 41) mg/dl; normal value: (110 +/- 35) mg/dl; P =
      0.04], decreased to normal value [(105 +/- 29) mg/dl, P = 0.02] in the
      malnutrition group while having no obvious changes in the control group [(129 +/-
      13) mg/dl, P = 0.34]. No significant changes in concentrations of IgG and IgA
      were found (P in the range of 0.20-0.57). The average weight gain was 1.862 kg in
      malnutrition group [before PN: (45.8 +/- 8.9) kg, after PN: (48.0 +/- 8.8) kg; P 
      = 0.005] and no significant changes in the control group [before PN: (55.6 +/-
      6.1) kg, after PN: (56.3 +/- 6.0) kg; P = 0.46]. There was an increase in
      infectious complications in the control group (control group: 4 cases, 25%,
      malnourished group: 2 cases, 12.5%; P = 0.13). CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative
      parenteral nutrition ameliorated the humoral immunity, increased the body weight 
      in patients with obvious malnutrition, whereas it had little value for those
      without or with mild malnutrition.

TI  - [Diet therapy in chronic inflammatory bowel disease: results from meta-analysis
      and randomized controlled trials].
PG  - 2041-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic inflammatory bowel
      diseases of unknown etiology. Unspecific immunosuppressive therapy represents
      current standard treatment and is often associated with severe side effects.
      Several treatment regimens have been evaluated to identify alternative
      therapeutic options. Among these different diet therapies were investigated.
      Objective of this paper is to review the results of diet therapy in chronic
      inflammatory bowel disease on the basis of randomised controlled trials and
      meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. METHODS: Medline and Cochrane
      Library were searched for meta-analysis and randomised controlled trials
      investigating this question. Additionally reference lists of identified articles 
      and text books were checked for further trials. RESULTS: Four meta-analyses
      investigated the treatment of acute Crohn's disease with elemental-,
      semi-elemental-, and polymeric diets in comparison to corticosteroids or to
      another form of enteral diet. All meta-analyses show a superiority of
      corticosteroids and no difference in the effect of the compared enteral diets.
      Randomised controlled trials investigating diet therapy in ulcerative colitis
      have not been summarised in a meta-analysis yet. Eleven randomised trials were
      identified which evaluated diets in ulcerative colitis patients: Dietary
      supplementation with n-3-fatty acids (6 trials), elemental diet [2], dietary
      supplementation with dietary fiber [1], elimination diet [1], and dietary
      supplementation with olestra [1]. Only for the elimination diet a significant
      positive effect on the course of disease was found in one trial which
      investigated only 18 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Enteral nutritional therapy of acute 
      Crohn's disease is less effective than treatment with corticosteroids. In case of
      severe steroid induced side effects diet treatment can present a promising
      alternative. Superiority of one of the investigated different formulations was
      not found. Meta-analyses of randomised trials provide a clear and easy to
      understand presentation of the effect of this intervention. Eleven published
      trials investigating the effect of diets in ulcerative colitis show only for
      elimination diet a positive treatment effect. The trials do find a positive
      effect of one of the other interventions but the trials are very small and cannot
      exclude a treatment effect. Meta-analysis of these trials would be helpful for a 
      better presentation and understanding of these results.

TI  - The role of endoscopy in the evaluation of fistulizing Crohn's disease.
PG  - 621-33
AB  - Fistulas in Crohn's disease are classified as internal fistulas, for example,
      enteroenteric, enterovesical, rectovaginal, and external fistulas, for example,
      enterocutaneous, perianal, and parastomal. Although radiographic contrast studies
      are superior to endoscopy for diagnosing fistulas, endoscopic procedures have a
      definite role in the evaluation and management of fistulizing Crohn's disease.
      Endoscopy allows for tissue sampling, and provides information regarding the
      extent and severity of gastrointestinal inflammation, and the presence of such
      complications as strictures and cancer. Preoperative colonoscopy has particular
      value in assessing an enterocolonic fistula, and has important implications
      regarding the type of surgery performed. Endoscopic therapy for Crohn's fistula
      is less certain, but may allow for dilation of associated strictures, and may
      someday serve as a better delivery system for targeted anticytokine and
      immunologically based therapy.

AB  - Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is used to evaluate upper gastrointestinal
      symptoms in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. This article discusses the 
      procedure, which may allow for the diagnosis of Crohn's disease of the esophagus,
      stomach, and/or duodenum. Biopsies of normal gastric mucosa in patients with
      indeterminate colitis may be helpful in making a diagnosis of Crohn's colitis.
      Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy may allow for therapeutic intervention in terms 
      of bleeding and stricturing disease.

TI  - Role of serology and routine laboratory tests in childhood inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 325-9
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Serology is reported to be helpful in evaluating children for
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and distinguishing chronic ulcerative colitis
      (CUC) from Crohn's disease (CD). The markers include perinuclear staining
      antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA) for CUC and anti-Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae antibody (ASCA) for CD. In the clinical setting, hemoglobin (Hgb) and 
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are commonly performed for screening
      symptomatic children for IBD. We examined whether there was an additional benefit
      of serology in addition to specific symptoms and routine laboratory tests in
      screening for IBD. METHOD: Medical record data was reviewed on children
      investigated for IBD from February 1999 to April 2001. Children were included if 
      they had blood analyzed for pANCA and ASCA, Hgb, ESR, and colonoscopy as part of 
      their assessment. RESULTS: Of 177 cases reviewed, 51 were diagnosed with CUC, 39 
      with CD, and 26 other inflammatory conditions. Visible rectal bleeding was the
      most discriminating symptom (occurred in 60/90 cases of IBD and 5/61 without
      IBD). There was a significant difference between the proportion with CUC positive
      for pANCA (42/51) and those with abnormal Hgb and ESR (30/51) (p < 0.05), but not
      between children with CD who were ASCA positive (18/39) and those with abnormal
      Hgb and ESR (26/39) (p = 0.27). The sensitivity and specificity of combined pANCA
      and ASCA was 68% and 92%, respectively. For the combination of Hgb, ESR, and the 
      presence of rectal bleeding the respective values were 86% and 67%. Serology
      combined with Hgb and ESR and rectal bleeding as independent factors
      significantly (p < 0.05) improved sensitivity (89%) but reduced specificity
      (60%). Screening with the combination of rectal bleeding, Hgb, and ESR identified
      86% (77/90) patients with IBD prior to an endoscopic procedure. A further 3 of 90
      (3.3%) screened positive with the addition of serology. CONCLUSION: Serology
      tests have a high degree of specificity for IBD while routine laboratory test
      have a higher sensitivity. When serology is combined with rectal bleeding, Hgb,
      and ESR, the sensitivity of screening children for IBD is significantly improved.
      However the large majority of children with IBD can be identified with a clinical
      history and routine laboratory tests as needing an endoscopic procedure with
      little benefit of adding serology.

TI  - Refeeding syndrome with enteral nutrition in children: a case report, literature 
      review and clinical guidelines.
PG  - 515-20
AB  - Refeeding syndrome is a potentially fatal complication of the nutritional
      management of severely malnourished patients. The syndrome almost always develops
      during the early stages of refeeding. It can be associated with a severe
      derangement in electrolyte and fluid balance, and result in significant morbidity
      and mortality. It is most often reported in adults receiving total parenteral
      nutrition (TPN), although refeeding with enteral feeds can also precipitate this 
      syndrome. We report what we believe to be the first case of refeeding syndrome in
      an adolescent with newly diagnosed Crohn's disease. This developed within a few
      days of starting exclusive polymeric enteral nutrition. A systematic literature
      review revealed 27 children who developed refeeding syndrome after oral/enteral
      feeding. Of these, nine died as a direct result of complications of this
      syndrome. We discuss the implications of this syndrome on clinical practice and
      propose evidence-based guidelines for its management.

TI  - Prevalence of factor V G1691A (Leiden), prothrombin G20210A, and methylene
      tetrahydrofolate reductase C677T thrombophilic mutations in children with
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 629-35
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have an increased
      incidence of thromboembolic events. This risk may be caused by an increased
      frequency of thrombophilic mutations such as factor V Leiden G1691A (FVL),
      prothrombin G20210A (PT), or methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase C667T (MTHFR). 
      Prevalence rates of heterozygous mutations in FVL, PT, and MTHFR are reported for
      whites (1.8%, 1.3%, 26.6%, respectively), blacks (0.8%, 0.3%, and 12.4%,
      respectively), and Hispanics (1.2%, 2.4%, and 41.5%, respectively). We sought to 
      determine the prevalence of these thrombophilic mutations in a large cohort of
      children with IBD. METHODS: Children aged 21 years or younger with IBD were
      genotyped for FVL, PT, and MTHFR mutations by polymerase chain reaction
      amplification and restriction enzyme digestion. Prevalence rates were compared
      with established rates in the respective populations. RESULTS: Of 92 patients
      enrolled, 89 (62 with Crohn disease, 24 with ulcerative colitis, and 3 with
      indeterminate colitis) had genotype results available. The mean age was 13.3 +/- 
      4.2 years (range, 2-21 years). Statistical analysis was performed on 89 FVL, PT, 
      and MTHFR allele pairs. Polymerase chain reaction genotyping identified 5
      patients with heterozygous FVL mutations, 3 patients heterozygous for the PT
      mutation, and 36 patients heterozygous and 4 patients homozygous for the MTHFR
      mutation. The thrombophilic allele mutation frequencies in our sample were not
      significantly different from predicted weighted average values: FVL, 2.8% versus 
      1.5%; PT, 1.7% versus 1.1%; and MTHFR, 24.7% versus 24.4%. In 24 patients with a 
      family history of thrombosis, 1 was heterozygous for FVL and for MTHFR, 1 was
      heterozygous for FVL and homozygous for MTHFR, 2 were heterozygous for PT, and 9 
      were heterozygous MTHFR. There was no significant correlation between family
      history of thrombosis and presence of a thrombophilic mutation. The four patients
      with homozygous mutations for MTHFR, two of whom also were heterozygous for FVL, 
      did not have either a personal history of thrombosis or a family history of
      thrombotic events. Two patients had thrombotic events without mutations in these 
      genotypes: one had protein S deficiency and the other had no identifiable cause. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The presence of genetic mutations that predispose to hypercoagulable
      states does not appear to correlate with the prevalence of IBD or to
      thromboembolic events in patients with IBD. There was no statistical difference
      between the proportions of the mutated allele frequency in our study patients and
      the general population.

TI  - [Clinical features of Crohn's disease: its diagnosis and treatment].
PG  - 581-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To enhance our understanding of Crohn's disease and improve its early 
      diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic efficacy. METHODS: Thirty-one patients with
      active Crohn's disease were studied. All their diagnostic and therapeutic results
      were analyzed. RESULTS: Most patients were young adults, with a 1.14:1 female
      predominance in prevalence. The disease affects any segment or a combination of
      segments of the alimentary tract from the mouth to the anus. However, the colon
      and the small bowel were the major sites involved. Recurrent episodes of
      abdominal pain and watery diarrhea were the most common symptoms. In addition,
      low grade fever, emaciation, anemia, and symptoms with skin, joints or perianal
      complications could be discovered if attention was paid. An endoscopy combined
      with histologic examination in biopsy specimens provided characteristic features 
      with a diagnostic accuracy of 62.9%. Granulomas were identifiable in 30.8% of all
      biopsy specimens. Transabdominal bowel sonography (TABS) accurately detected
      intestinal complications. Factors causing misdiagnosis were: insufficient
      attention of the disease, diverse clinical presentations, or over emphasis of the
      diagnostic value of granulomas. Oral prednisone therapy for mild to moderate
      disease was more rapid to receive clinical remission when compared to oral
      aminosalicylates (SASP or 5-ASA). Nutrition support therapy was given in 20 cases
      with active disease and received beneficial effects on host nutritional status.
      Immunosuppressives were used on an individual basis, and showed variable effects 
      with limited experience. Sixteen patients had operations due to intestinal
      obstruction or failure to respond to drug therapies. Rapid improvement after
      operations was achieved. CONCLUSIONS: Crohn's diseases not uncommon in China.
      Abdominal pain and watery diarrhea are two hallmark symptoms. Endoscopy (with
      biopsy), and TABS were both valuable procedures for diagnosis. Prednisone and
      SASP/5-ASA were effective as inductive therapies. Surgery, as an alternative and 
      effective treatment, provided another choice in well selected patients.

TI  - Vitamin D status in children, adolescents, and young adults with Crohn disease.
PG  - 1077-81
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn disease (CD) and vitamin D deficiency are associated with
      decreased bone mineralization. OBJECTIVE: We examined the prevalence of and risk 
      factors for hypovitaminosis D in children, adolescents, and young adults with CD.
      DESIGN: Growth, clinical characteristics, vitamin D intake ( micro g/d), and bone
      mineral density (g/cm(2)) were measured in a cross-sectional study of 112
      subjects (44 females) who had CD and were 5-22 y of age. Hypovitaminosis D was
      defined as a serum concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] < 38 nmol/L.
      RESULTS: The mean (+/- SD) serum concentration of 25(OH)D was 59.7 +/- 26.9
      nmol/L, and 16% (95% CI: 9.3%, 23%) of the subjects had hypovitaminosis D.
      Hypovitaminosis D was most prevalent during the winter (31%; P = 0.02), among the
      African Americans (56%; P = 0.01), in the subjects with CD confined to the upper 
      gastrointestinal tract (44%; P = 0.05), and in the subjects with a greater
      lifetime exposure to glucocorticoid therapy (23.7 +/- 13.5 compared with 17.5 +/-
      12.2 mg/d; P = 0.05). There was no association between hypovitaminosis D and
      either bone mineral density (P = 0.10) or average dietary intake of vitamin D
      (4.6 +/- 3.6 micro g/d; P = 0.87). CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of pediatric
      patients with CD, hypovitaminosis D was common and was associated with the winter
      season, African American ethnicity, CD confined to the upper gastrointestinal
      tract, and magnitude of lifetime exposure to glucocorticoid therapy. The
      occurrence of these factors should prompt assessment of 25(OH)D status and
      clinical care optimized by supplementing subjects who have low serum
      concentrations. The physiologic relevance of ethnicity on 25(OH)D status in
      children with CD remains to be determined.

TI  - Enteral feeding.
PG  - 695-8
AB  - In this review, topics with scientific strength, topical interest, and
      controversy were selected. Over the past 50 years, malnutrition has become
      increasingly recognized as a cause of increased morbidity and mortality in
      hospital patients. From 1970 to 1980, parenteral nutrition was advocated as the
      most appropriate form of nutritional therapy for hospital patients. Since then,
      parenteral nutrition has been replaced by enteral nutrition as the best way of
      delivering nutrients to hospital patients. The timing of enteral nutrition has
      been debated. Should it be instituted early, within the first 24 hours? In
      addition, enteral nutrition containing immune-enhancing nutrients such as
      arginine, omega-3 fatty acids, glutamine, and nucleotides has been advocated for 
      critically ill patients. The relative merits of enteral versus total parenteral
      nutrition continue to be debated. Questions about possible complications related 
      to enteral nutrition have been raised. Patients are at risk of nosocomial
      pneumonia from aspiration and at risk of bowel ischemia because enteral nutrition
      increases intestinal oxygen consumption. Steroids are often used to treat Crohn
      disease, but because of undesirable side effects, various techniques have been
      used to reduce steroid dependency. Enteral nutrition has been advocated as a way 
      of reducing steroid dependency. Finally, enteral nutrition is routinely used to
      feed demented patients and those in a vegetative state. It is not clear whether
      this practice alters outcome or quality of life.

TI  - Mucosal and invading bacteria in patients with inflammatory bowel disease
      compared with controls.
PG  - 1034-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: Endogenous intestinal bacteria and/or specific bacterial pathogens
      are suspected of being involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel
      diseases (IBD). The aim of this study was to investigate IBD tissues for
      different bacterial population groups harbouring the mucosal surface and/or
      invading the mucosa. METHODS: Tissue sections from surgical resections from the
      terminal ileum and/or the colon from 24 IBD patients (12 active ulcerative
      colitis (UC), 12 active Crohn disease (CD)) and 14 non-IBD controls were studied 
      by fluorescent in situ hybridization on a quantifiable basis. RESULTS: More
      bacteria were detected on the mucosal surface of IBD patients than on those of
      non-IBD controls (P < 0.05). Bacterial invasion of the mucosa was evident in
      83.3% of colonic specimens from the UC patients, in 55.6% of the ileal and in 25%
      of the colonic specimens from the CD patients, but no bacteria were detected in
      the tissues of the controls. Colonic UC specimens were colonized by a variety of 
      organisms, such as bacteria belonging to the gamma subdivision of Proteobacteria,
      the Enterobacteriaceae, the Bacteroides/Prevotella cluster, the Clostridium
      histolyticum/Clostridium lituseburense group, the Clostridium
      coccoides/Eubacterium rectale group, high G + C Gram-positive bacteria, or
      sulphate-reducing bacteria, while CD samples harboured mainly bacteria belonging 
      to the former three groups. CONCLUSION: Pathogenic events in CD and UC may be
      associated with different alterations in the mucosal flora of the ileum and
      colon.

TI  - Growth in paediatric Crohn's disease.
PG  - 11-5
AB  - Growth failure (GF) is one of the major complications affecting children with
      inflammatory bowel disease. The faltering is temporary in 40-50% of cases and
      prolonged in 10-20% in Crohn's disease (CD). Such failure is rare in children
      with ulcerative colitis (5%). This complication is often associated with retarded
      bone development and delayed onset of sexual maturation. The delayed linear
      growth has a variety of causes including insufficient intake due to anorexia and 
      the inflammatory process with increased energy and protein expenditure. Other
      factors are increased intestinal loss, secondary hypopituitarism and treatment
      with steroids. Therapeutic strategies of CD in children have changed this last
      decade by introducing new therapeutic agents such as topic steroids,
      immunosuppressors, anti-TNF (antibody and notably in children enteral nutrition
      which has shown its efficacy in inducing remissions of active CD, restoring
      nutritional status and stimulation of linear growth. The results of a recent
      prospective multicentric study over 2 years in 82 CD show that severe GF (-2 SD) 
      is initially present in 15% (n = 12), among them 11 remain < -2SD after 2 years
      of follow-up. Six patients who were on the normal range initially increased their
      GF during the follow-up (< -2SD) (total 21% < -2SD (n = 17) at 2 years). At
      inclusion in this group there was no difference in growth velocity, used of
      steroids, enteral nutrition or severity of CD as compared to the group with no
      GF. It suggests that new treatment strategy should be developed in the future for
      this specific complication of paediatric CD.

TI  - Fundamental mechanisms of growth failure in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 7-10
AB  - Growth failure is common in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and
      has been attributed chiefly to undernutrition. Liquid enteral feeding can reverse
      the calorie deficit and increase growth velocity. The inflammatory process per se
      may also directly inhibit linear growth. After institution of enteral nutrition, 
      significant changes in serum growth factors and inflammatory indices have been
      observed before any changes in nutritional parameters [Bannerjee et al.,
      Gastroenterology 2000;118:A526]. In rats with trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid
      (TNBS)-induced colitis, about 60% of the final growth impairment can be
      attributed to undernutrition, inflammation accounting for the remaining growth
      deficit. Young patients with Crohn's disease and growth failure have normal
      stimulated and spontaneous growth hormone (GH) secretion and reduced plasma
      concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I), suggesting a degree of GH
      resistance. Rats with TNBS colitis also have normal plasma GH and reduced IGF-I
      concentrations, mediated by a combination of undernutrition and active
      inflammation. Immunoneutralization of interleukin-6 (IL-6) increases hepatic
      IGF-I mRNA expression, plasma concentrations of IGF-I and linear growth. In
      contrast, administration of anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha antibodies (TNF-ab)
      had no effect on IGF-I in this model. TNFab did, however, increase linear growth,
      suggesting inhibitory effects of TNF-alpha on the growth axis by mechanisms other
      than reduction in IGF-I. Preliminary data suggests that TNF-alpha inhibits
      maturation of growth plate chondrocytes. We have identified IL-6 receptors on
      growth plate chondrocytes but to date have not identified the effect, if any, of 
      IL-6 directly at the growth plate.

TI  - [Sciatica secondary to a presacral abscess as the first manifestation of Crohn's 
      disease].
PG  - 505-7
AB  - Presacral abscess is a rare musculoskeletal complication of Crohn's disease. The 
      clinical picture is sometimes insidious and a delay in diagnosis may increase
      morbidity. Abdominal-pelvic computerized axial tomography (CAT) has proven to be 
      very useful in the diagnosis of this entity, which usually requires surgical
      treatment. We present the case of a 22-year-old man who presented to hospital for
      colic-type abdominal pain of 6 months' evolution and intermittent episodes of
      joint pain. The patient also presented mechanical pain in the right gluteus
      muscle of two weeks' evolution irradiating to the posterior side of the muscle.
      Complementary investigations confirmed the suspected diagnosis of Crohn's disease
      and showed presacral abscess. Treatment was surgical.

TI  - Lactase deficiency: not more common in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease than in patients with chronic abdominal pain.
PG  - 339-43
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Lactase deficiency is commonly found in adults with inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). Our aim was to determine its prevalence in children with IBD.
      METHODS: We conducted a retrospective and descriptive analysis of patients with
      symptomatic IBD whose mucosal lactase activity was measured on duodenal biopsies 
      obtained during gastrointestinal endoscopic evaluations. Age- and gender-matched 
      controls were chosen randomly from a group with chronic abdominal pain. RESULTS: 
      One hundred twelve patients with IBD were identified from January 1994 to
      December 2000. Seventy-nine (71%) had Crohn disease, and 33 (29%) had ulcerative 
      colitis. Forty-five (40%) of all IBD patients (29 with Crohn disease and 16 with 
      ulcerative colitis) had low lactase activity levels (< 15 microM/min/gm). The
      prevalence of lactase deficiency in patients with IBD was 37% (38 of 103) in
      white patients and 78% (7 of 9) in blacks. Thirty-four of 112 controls (30%) had 
      lactase deficiency. IBD patients were more likely to be lactase deficient than
      the controls, but the difference was not statistically significant ( = 0.162).
      Normal duodenal histology was found in 67% of lactase-deficient IBD patients
      compared with 82% in lactase-sufficient IBD patients. The frequency of duodenal
      inflammation did not differ significantly between lactase-deficient and
      -sufficient patients with IBD ( = 0.068). CONCLUSIONS: More than one third of
      pediatric patients with IBD have lactase deficiency, which is not significantly
      different from non-IBD patients with chronic abdominal pain. The majority of
      lactase-deficient patients with IBD have normal duodenal biopsy results. Lactase 
      activity from small bowel biopsy specimens can be measured at the time of initial
      endoscopy. Reevaluation, either by small bowel biopsy or the breath hydrogen
      test, may then be considered during follow-up of symptomatic patients.

TI  - Diet and gastrointestinal disease.
PG  - 567-9
AB  - Dietary manipulation can be an important part of therapy for several common
      gastrointestinal disorders. In Crohn disease, the provision of adequate protein
      and calories may not only improve symptoms but may be associated with
      acceleration of growth. In celiac disease, the dietary restriction of gluten is
      curative of the intestinal inflammation. In chronic nonspecific diarrhea and
      functional constipation, the provision of appropriate amounts of fiber and fluids
      may ameliorate symptoms. A thorough understanding of the role of diet is
      essential to the management of these disorders.

TI  - Improvement in cholestasis associated with total parenteral nutrition after
      treatment with an antibody against tumour necrosis factor alpha.
PG  - 317-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many patients receiving long-term total parenteral nutrition (TPN)
      develop liver disease; cholestasis is common and may be severe. Antitumour
      necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) antibodies have recently been used in order to
      treat Crohn's disease, but their effect on cholestasis in humans has not been
      previously described. CASE REPORT: A 45-year-old woman had complicated Crohn's
      disease with multiple fistulae and only 1 m of residual small bowel. She had been
      receiving TPN for 2.5 years when she developed cholestasis which worsened despite
      adjustments to her TPN regimen. Infliximab, an anti-TNFalpha antibody, was given 
      with the aim of treating an enterocutaneous fistula, but it also produced a
      marked biochemical and histological improvement in the TPN-related cholestasis.
      CONCLUSIONS: Anti-TNFalpha antibodies appeared in this case to improve
      TPN-related cholestasis. This implies that TNFalpha may play an important role in
      the development of this condition.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel diseases: principles of nutritional therapy.
PG  - 187-98
AB  - Inflammatory Bowel Diseases - ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease- are chronic
      gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases of unknown etiology. Decreased oral
      intake, malabsorption, accelerated nutrient losses, increased requirements, and
      drug-nutrient interactions cause nutritional and functional deficiencies that
      require proper correction by nutritional therapy. The goals of the different
      forms of nutritional therapy are to correct nutritional disturbances and to
      modulate inflammatory response, thus influencing disease activity. Total
      parenteral nutrition has been used to correct and to prevent nutritional
      disturbances and to promote bowel rest during active disease, mainly in cases of 
      digestive fistulae with high output. Its use should be reserved for patients who 
      cannot tolerate enteral nutrition. Enteral nutrition is effective in inducing
      clinical remission in adults and promoting growth in children. Due to its low
      complication rate and lower costs, enteral nutrition should be preferred over
      total parenteral nutrition whenever possible. Both present equal effectiveness in
      primary therapy for remission of active Crohn's disease. Nutritional intervention
      may improve outcome in certain individuals; however, because of the costs and
      complications of such therapy, careful selection is warranted, especially in
      patients presumed to need total parenteral nutrition. Recent research has focused
      on the use of nutrients as primary treatment agents. Immunonutrition is an
      important therapeutic alternative in the management of inflammatory bowel
      diseases, modulating the inflammation and changing the eicosanoid synthesis
      profile. However, beneficial reported effects have yet to be translated into the 
      clinical practice. The real efficacy of these and other nutrients (glutamine,
      short-chain fatty acids, antioxidants) still need further evaluation through
      prospective and randomized trials.

TI  - Self-assessment of sexual maturity status in children with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 223-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the validity of self-assessment of sexual maturity status 
      (SMS) in children with Crohn's disease (CD), a pediatric chronic disease that
      often affects growth and development. STUDY DESIGN: Self-assessment of SMS in 100
      children (34 girls) ages 8 to 18 years with CD from the Children's Hospital of
      Philadelphia was compared with an independent assessment by one well trained
      pediatrician, using drawings and written descriptions of Tanner stages of breast,
      genital, and pubic hair development. RESULTS: Overall, subjects with CD (age,
      14.3 +/- 2.8 years) had delayed growth status based on height-for-age (HAZ) and
      weight-for-age Z scores (WAZ). Boys were more growth delayed (HAZ, -0.90 +/- 1.1;
      WAZ, -0.75 +/- 1.3) than girls (HAZ, -0.45 +/- 1.3; WAZ, -0.20 +/- 1.1). Kappa
      coefficients (kappa) showed excellent agreement between child and physician
      assessment of SMS, ranging from kappa = 0.74 to 0.85, depending on sex and SMS
      component, corresponding to a 79% to 88% agreement. When not in agreement,
      children tended to overestimate their SMS. Boys who overestimated (n = 8) had
      significantly higher weight and BMI status than boys who assessed accurately.
      CONCLUSIONS: Self-assessment of SMS was a reliable and valid method in children
      with CD and is useful in screening for maturational delay in children with
      chronic disease.

TI  - Preoperative management is more important than choice of sutured or stapled
      anastomosis in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 154-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To find out if there were any differences in postoperative
      complications and anastomotic leak rate between sutured and stapled anastomoses
      after bowel resection in patients exposed to the same preoperative management
      programme. DESIGN: Prospective observational non-randomised study. SETTING:
      Colorectal unit, Sweden. PATIENTS: Between 1996 and 2000 bowel resections with
      anastomosis were done for 42 consecutive patients with Crohn's disease. 20
      patients had their anastomoses sutured (sutured group) and 22 had their
      anastomosis stapled (stapled group) over two successive periods. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURES: Postoperative complications and anastomotic leak rate. RESULTS: None of
      the patients were on immunosuppressive treatment and about half in each group had
      had several weeks of preoperative enteral nutrition. No anastomotic-related
      complications and few other postoperative complications were noted, irrespective 
      of the anastomotic technique used. CONCLUSION: A strategy to operate on Crohn
      patients without steroids and, if indicated, treated preoperatively with enteral 
      nutrition and percutaneous drainage of abscesses resulted in no anastomotic leaks
      and few postoperative complications. These results were independent of the
      anastomotic technique used.

TI  - Infliximab decreases resource use among patients with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 151-6
AB  - GOALS: Surgery accounts for one half, and hospitalizations for one third, of
      overall costs for patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Infliximab induces
      remission and heals fistulas in CD but is more costly than traditional therapies.
      Its impact upon resource use in CD is unknown. STUDY: The medical records were
      reviewed for all CD patients managed at our institution for at least 1 full year 
      both before and after initial infliximab infusion. The incidences of
      hospitalizations, hospitalized days, surgeries, endoscopies, radiologic
      examinations, outpatient and emergency room (ER) visits were studied (weighted
      according to time period). RESULTS: There were 79 patients (59% female, mean age 
      38.6 years). A decrease was seen in the annual incidence of all surgeries (38%, p
      < 0.01), gastrointestinal (GI) surgeries (18%, p < 0.05), endoscopies (43%, p <
      0.01), ER visits (66%, p < 0.05), all outpatient visits (16%, p < 0.05),
      outpatient GI visits (20%, p < 0.01), all radiologic examinations (12%, p <
      0.01), and non-plain films (13%, p < 0.01). Fistula patients (n = 37) had
      decreases in hospitalizations (59%, p < 0.05); GI surgeries (59%, p < 0.01); all 
      surgeries (66%, p < 0.01); all, GI, and surgical outpatient visits (27%, 26%, and
      70%, respectively, p < 0.05 for all); ER visits (64%, p < 0.05); all radiologic
      examinations (40%, p < 0.05); and non-plain films (61%, p < 0.05). Patients with 
      luminal disease(n = 42) had decreases in endoscopies (52%, p < 0.05), and ER
      visits (69%, p < 0.05). Patients of both genders and all ages experienced
      decreases in resource use. CONCLUSION: Patients with CD decreased their use of
      some services, with a decreased number of hospitalizations and a decrease in the 
      use of surgical services seen primarily in the patients infused for fistulas.
      This decrease in use of healthcare resources raises the potential of overall cost
      savings in CD patients receiving this drug.

TI  - Anti-inflammatory effects of enteral diet components on Crohn's disease-affected 
      tissues in vitro.
PG  - 430-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The mechanism of action of elemental diet in Crohn's disease
      treatment, is unknown. Alteration of bacterial flora, low antigenicity, low fat
      content and improvement of nutritional status are postulated to play a role in
      the anti-inflammatory effect of elemental diet. AIM: To determine whether
      elemental diet or its modifications has a direct anti-inflammatory effect on
      colonic tissue biopsies in vitro. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Colonic or ileal biopsies
      from 39 patients with inflammatory bowel disease and control patients were
      incubated for 24 hours with enteral diets in which nitrogen sources were amino
      acids as in elemental diet, casein or whey. Tissues were incubated with elemental
      diet, casein or whey, at dilutions of 1:5, 1:10 or 1:20 in Waymouth's complete
      medium; a medium control was also included. Tissue viability was assessed by
      bromodeoxyuridine uptake. Interleukin-1beta, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist
      and interleukin-10 concentrations in supernatants were measured by immunoassay
      (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). RESULTS: Incubation of tissues from Crohn's 
      disease with elemental diet resulted in an increase in the ratio of interleukin-1
      receptor antagonist/interleukin-1beta vs control statistically significant at
      1:10 (89.6+/-17 vs 45.7+/-9. 1, p<0.05). Incubation of Crohn's tissue with casein
      resulted in a significant increase of interleukin-1 receptor
      antagonist/interleukin-1beta ratio at dilutions 1:20, 1:10 and 1:5 (101.8+/-22.0,
      p=0.05, 142.8+/-24.6, p<0.05; 109.7+/-25.0, p=0.05). In ulcerative colitis tissue
      and non-inflamed non-inflammatory bowel disease control tissue, no significant
      increase in interleukin 1 receptor antagonist/interleukin-1beta ratio was seen
      after incubation with elemental diet, casein and whey. CONCLUSION: Elemental diet
      incubation increases anti-inflammatory:proinflammatory cytokine ratio in Crohn's 
      disease and this anti-inflammatory effect is not specifically due to amino acid
      composition, as diets containing casein have similar anti-inflammatory effects.

TI  - Long-term evolution of disease behavior of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 244-50
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Vienna classification of Crohn's disease (CD) distinguishes three
      patient subgroups according to disease behavior: stricturing, penetrating, and
      inflammatory. Our aim was to assess the long-term evolution of the disease
      behavior of CD and to determine the predictive factors and prognostic
      implications of this evolution. METHODS: Occurrence and predictive factors of a
      stricturing and/or a penetrating complication were searched for in 2,002 patients
      with CD studied retrospectively. In addition, the 1995-2000 disease course was
      assessed prospectively in a cohort of 646 patients with disease duration >5
      years, classified according to their previous disease behavior. RESULTS: 1,199
      patients (60%) developed a stricturing (n = 254) or a penetrating (n = 945)
      complication. Twenty-year actuarial rates of inflammatory, stricturing, and
      penetrating disease were 12, 18, and 70%, respectively. The initial location of
      lesions was the main determinant of the time and type of the complication. In the
      cohort study, year-by-year activity and therapeutic requirements did not show
      significant sustained differences between behavioral subgroups. CONCLUSION: Most 
      patients with CD will eventually one day develop a stricturing or a perforating
      complication. Initial location determines the type of the complication.
      Classification of patients into a behavioral group from previous history has no
      impact upon activity during the following years.

TI  - The genetics of inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 63-76
AB  - The complex genetics of IBD is characterized by more than one susceptibility
      locus, genetic heterogeneity, incomplete penetrance, and probable gene-gene and
      gene-environment interactions. Functional candidate gene association studies
      during the past few decades have revealed only modest associations between IBD
      and genetic variants in the HLA genes and a limited number of other genes that
      are involved in immune regulation and the inflammatory response. Important
      advances in IBD genetics research have come about from systematic genome searches
      for IBD loci. The identification of Crohn's disease-associated NOD2 genetic
      variants that appear to alter the innate immune response to bacteria is a seminal
      finding that perhaps is the greatest advance toward understanding the
      pathogenesis of IBD in decades. The future discovery of other IBD genetic risk
      factors, facilitated by the completion of the human genome sequencing and
      annotation, may allow the development of better therapies, possibly including
      preventive therapies, for patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

TI  - Fat composition may be a clue to explain the primary therapeutic effect of
      enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease: results of a double blind randomised
      multicentre European trial.
PG  - 164-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dietary fat has been suggested to determine the therapeutic effect of
      enteral diets in Crohn's disease. AIM: To assess the efficacy of two whole
      protein based diets with different fat compositions (n6 polyunsaturated fatty
      acids v monounsaturated fatty acids) in inducing clinical remission in active
      Crohn's disease compared with steroids. METHODS: Sixty two patients with active
      Crohn's disease were randomised to receive, for not more than 4 weeks: (a) a
      polymeric enteral diet containing 35 g of lipids per 1000 kcal, high in oleate
      (79%) and low in linoleate (6.5%) (PEN1), (b) an identical enteral diet except
      for the type of fat which was high in linoleate (45%) and low in oleate (28%)
      (PEN2), or (c) oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/day). Diets were double blindly
      administered. The steroid group received a conventional ward diet. Treatment
      failure was considered when remission was not achieved at week 4. Clinical
      activity and biological and nutritional parameters were monitored. Independent
      predictors of remission were identified by stepwise logistic regression analysis.
      RESULTS: Overall remission rates (by intention to treat) were 20% (4/20) for
      PEN1, 52% (12/23) for PEN2, and 79% (15/19) for steroids (overall p=0.001;
      p<0.0005 steroids v PEN1, and p=0.056 PEN2 v PEN1). After excluding those
      patients who were non-compliant during the first week (per protocol analysis),
      remission rates were 27%, 63%, and 79%, respectively (p=0.008, steroids and PEN2 
      v PEN1). After adjusting for confounding variables, PEN1 remained significantly
      associated with a poor response. CONCLUSION: The type of dietary fat may be of
      importance for the primary therapeutic effect of enteral nutrition in active
      Crohn's disease.

TI  - Therapy of Crohn's disease in childhood.
PG  - 809-25
AB  - Crohn's disease in childhood is a chronic relapsing and remitting condition that 
      can significantly impact on normal growth and development. This influences the
      choice of both initial and ongoing management. The goal of therapy is to induce
      and maintain remission with minimal side effects. Enteral nutrition as the sole
      therapy for active disease is effective in some children, thus avoiding the use
      of corticosteroids. In disease that is resistant to conventional treatment,
      immunosuppression or anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy is indicated. We review 
      the use of these treatments and discuss the new therapies being developed,
      including antibodies, cytokines and probiotics.

TI  - Strictureplasty in diffuse Crohn's jejunoileitis: safe and durable.
PG  - 764-70
AB  - PURPOSE: As an alternative to resection, strictureplasty may allow for
      preservation of intestinal length and avoidance of short-bowel syndrome in
      patients with diffuse Crohn's jejunoileitis. However, the long-term durability of
      the procedure and its safety have not been confirmed. The purpose of this study
      was to report our experience with strictureplasty for diffuse Crohn's
      jejunoileitis. METHODS: Between 1984 and 1999, 123 patients underwent a
      laparotomy that included an index strictureplasty for diffuse jejunoileitis.
      Patient history, operative details, and postoperative morbidities were obtained
      by chart review. Nineteen patients (15 percent) were receiving total parenteral
      nutrition for short-bowel syndrome, and 81 (66 percent) were taking chronic
      steroids. Total number of strictureplasties performed was 701 (median,
      5/patient). Seventy percent of patients underwent a synchronous bowel resection. 
      Follow-up information was determined by personal or phone interviews. Recurrence 
      was defined as the need for reoperation, and risk was calculated by the
      Kaplan-Meier method. Patients with diffuse jejunoileitis were also compared with 
      219 patients with limited small-bowel Crohn's disease undergoing strictureplasty.
      RESULTS: The overall morbidity rate was 20 percent, with septic complications
      occurring in 6 percent. The surgical recurrence rate was 29 percent with a median
      follow-up period of 6.7 (range, 1-16) years. The recurrence rate in diffuse
      jejunoileitis patients did not differ from that seen in patients with limited
      small-bowel Crohn's disease (P = 0.38). Short duration of disease and short
      interval since last surgery were significant predictors of accelerated recurrence
      (P = 0.008 and 0.04, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Strictureplasty is a safe and
      durable alternative to resection in diffuse Crohn's jejunoileitis. Patients with 
      a short duration of disease and short interval since last surgery are at higher
      risk for accelerated recurrence. Patients with diffuse jejunoileitis do not
      appear to be at higher risk for recurrence than patients with more limited
      Crohn's disease.

PG  - 892-900
AB  - Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), although a standard method for
      long-time enteral nutrition, still leaves uncertainty about details in
      indication, technique and complications. Based on own experiences (approximately 
      1000 PEG's and 170 EPJ's in the last 10 years) these topics are discussed. As new
      indications the PEG for decompression in chronic intestinal obstruction and the
      questionable relative contraindications ascites, peritoneal carcinosis and Morbus
      Crohn are discussed. The common thread-pull through-technique is recommended in a
      slightly modified variation, according to direct puncture techniques of small
      intestine: the cannulas inserted in the intestine are fixed by an endoscopic
      alligator forceps, thus facilitating precise puncture and raising safety for the 
      patient due to avoidance of dislocation. As complications local infections,
      implantation metastases and the buried bumper syndrome have to be mentioned and
      avoided. Alternative methods for PEG and different exchange systems for more
      comfort for the patients are discussed finally.

TI  - Modification of enteral diets in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 457-61
AB  - The provision of food is thought to promote the maintenance of gut integrity.
      Nutrients are able to elicit and affect both systemic and mucosal immune
      responses. Enteral diet therapy has long been known to be efficacious in
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly in childhood Crohn's disease.
      However, the mechanisms of action of these diets are not clear. Nutritional
      repletion, direct effects on the gut mucosa or decreased intestinal permeability 
      have all been postulated as being important in nutritional therapy. There is some
      evidence that the enteral diet has a direct effect on the gut mucosa by reducing 
      cytokine production and the accompanying inflammation, thus leading to decreased 
      intestinal permeability. Modifications of enteral diet composition have been
      evaluated in many studies. Such modifications include fat and/or protein content 
      and the addition of bioactive peptides. The fatty acid composition of the enteral
      diet seems to have a much greater impact on its efficacy than modification of the
      N source. As specific fatty acids are precursors of inflammatory mediators
      derived from arachidonic acid, the reduction in these components may be
      beneficial in nutritional therapy for IBD. Addition of bioactive peptides to
      enteral diet formulas may also have a role; such peptides may have specific
      growth factor or anti-inflammatory actions. There is still much work to be done
      to define disease-specific enteral diet formulas that are effective as therapies 
      for both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

TI  - [Effect of composition of enteral nutrition on energy expenditure and CO2
      production during periods of average and excessive energy intake].
PG  - 298-301
AB  - UNLABELLED: The objective of the presented work is to evaluate to what extent the
      CO2 production and O2 utilization and energy metabolism at rest (REE) are
      influenced by an excessive nutrient intake and to what extent by the composition 
      of enteral nutrition. REE, CO2 production and O2 utilization were investigated in
      9 patients on complete enteral nutrition by indirect calorimetry in four
      modifications: I--nutrition with 40% kJ fat in a ration 1.2x the energy output at
      rest at the onset of the trial; II--40% kJ and high energy intake (2.4x energy
      output at rest; III--60% kJ fat in ration of 1.2x energy output at rest; IV--60% 
      kJ fat and energy intake 2.4x energy output at rest. At 40% (I) and 60% (III) fat
      content in a caloriocally adequate diet the energy output at rest, the CO2
      production and O2 utilization did not differ (mean +/- SD: 1438 +/- 264.1 kcal/24
      h, 179 +/- 31.6 nl/min, 209 +/- 38.1 ml/min vs. 1431 +/- 342.7, 190 +/- 54.2, 207
      +/- 46.5). Comparison of modifications II and IV revealed a significant (p <
      0.05) increase of CO2 production on a diet rich in carbohydrates (218 +/- 52.0
      vs. 202 +/- 42.3). The energy output at rest (1674 +/- 389.6 vs. 1661 +/- 378.7),
      nor O2 production (240 +/- 54.5 vs. 242 +/- 55.4) changed. Overfeeding with 40%
      fat (II) as compared with (I) led to a rise of the energy output at rest (p <
      0.05), O2 utilization (p < 0.05) and CO2 production (p < 0.01). Overfeeding with 
      lipids (IV) led as compared with III to a rise of the energy output at rest and
      O2 utilization; CO2 production did not change. CONCLUSION: The composition of
      enteral nutrition according to the described modification does not influences the
      energy output at rest, O2 utilization and CO2 production under conditions of an
      adequate energy intake. In case of an excessive nutrient intake nutrition with
      60% fat does not lead to an increase of CO2 production.

TI  - [Pancreatic involvement in inflammatory bowel diseases in children].
PG  - 469-77
AB  - UNLABELLED: Pancreatitis in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children is
      anecdotal. In adults, symptomatic pancreatitis occurs in 2% and asymptomatic in 8
      to 21%. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The aim of our study was to review retrospectively 
      the frequency of pancreatitis in 124 pediatric patients (54.8% boys, 45.2% girls;
      97 with Crohn disease, 16 with ulcerative colitis and 11 with undetermined
      colitis). Diagnostic criterion of pancreatitis was an increase of amylasemia > or
      = +2 SD of the normal with or without evocative clinical symptoms. RESULTS:
      Symptomatic or asymptomatic pancreatitis was found in 27% (respectively 14.5 and 
      12.5%). Pancreatitis was significantly more frequent in girls as compared to boys
      (P = 0.04). Symptomatic pancreatitis was moderate and non complicated, often
      recurrent. It occurred mainly during active and severe diseases (P = 0.006). The 
      localizations of IBD were not discriminant. Strong relation with drug was found
      in 25% of pancreatitis mainly due to azathioprine or 5-aminosalicylic acid, and
      salazopyrin. Duodenal localisation of Crohn disease or hepatobiliary
      complications were found associated with pancreatitis in 18% and 15%
      respectively. CONCLUSION: These data suggest the high incidence of symptomatic
      and asymptomatic pancreatitis in children with IBD, the importance of its regular
      monitoring but also its multifactorial causes. Precise diagnosis of pancreatitis 
      in pediatric IBD has to be done in order to avoid inappropriate drug pancreatitis
      diagnosis.

TI  - Maintenance infliximab for Crohn's disease: the ACCENT I randomised trial.
PG  - 1541-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: We did a randomised controlled trial to assess the benefit of
      maintenance infliximab therapy in patients with active Crohn's disease who
      respond to a single infusion of infliximab. METHODS: 573 patients with a score of
      at least 220 on the Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) received a 5 mg/kg
      intravenous infusion of infliximab at week 0. After assessment of response at
      week 2, patients were randomly assigned repeat infusions of placebo at weeks 2
      and 6 and then every 8 weeks thereafter until week 46 (group I), repeat infusions
      of 5 mg/kg infliximab at the same timepoints (group II), or 5 mg/kg infliximab at
      weeks 2 and 6 followed by 10 mg/kg (group III). The prespecified co-primary
      endpoints were the proportion of patients who responded at week 2 and were in
      remission (CDAI <150) at week 30 and the time to loss of response up to week 54
      in patients who responded. Analyses of the co-primary endpoints were by intention
      to treat. FINDINGS: 335 (58%) patients responded to a single infusion of
      infliximab within 2 weeks. At week 30, 23 of 110 (21%) group I patients were in
      remission, compared with 44 of 113 (39%) group II (p=0.003) and 50 of 112 (45%)
      group III (p=0.0002) patients. Thus, patients in groups II and III combined were 
      more likely to sustain clinical remission than patients in group I (odds ratio
      2.7, 95% CI 1.6-4.6). Throughout the 54-week trial, the median time to loss of
      response was 38 weeks (IQR 15 to >54) and more than 54 weeks (21 to >54) for
      groups II and III, respectively, compared with 19 weeks (10-45) for group I
      (p=0.002 and p=0.0002, respectively). Infliximab safety was consistent with that 
      seen in other trials of infliximab in Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis.
      In particular, the incidence of serious infections was similar across treatment
      groups. INTERPRETATION: Patients with Crohn's disease who respond to an initial
      dose of infliximab are more likely to be in remission at weeks 30 and 54, to
      discontinue corticosteroids, and to maintain their response for a longer period
      of time, if infliximab treatment is maintained every 8 weeks.

TI  - Review article: a critical approach to new forms of treatment of Crohn's disease 
      and ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 53-8
AB  - Most patients with inflammatory bowel disease can be managed with conventional
      immunosuppressive therapy. The choice of agents to prevent relapses of
      inflammatory bowel disease must be based on efficacy, toxicity and cost. Studies 
      in animal models of inflammatory bowel disease indicate that chronic intestinal
      inflammation results from enhanced immune responses to bacteria that are present 
      normally in the lumen. Loss of tolerance, an abnormal function or defective
      healing of the mucosal barrier may all give raise to chronic intestinal
      inflammation. This hypothesis is the basis of new therapies aimed at either
      decreasing the levels of luminal bacterial antigens and/or selectively blocking
      detrimental mucosal immune responses. Anti-TNF is an example of this novel
      approach that is very effective in Crohn's disease. The use of biological therapy
      is costly, however, and the long-term complications are not yet known. The recent
      increase of tuberculosis in patients treated with anti-TNF indicates that careful
      monitoring is necessary. It is clear that the new forms of treatment may play an 
      important role in tailoring the appropriate drug to a specific group of patients.
      However, for the time being, fine-tuning in the use of conventional
      immunosuppression is necessary. New knowledge in the pharmacogenetics of these
      compounds allows improvements to be made in their use. It is to be hoped that a
      critical approach in the use of current and future drugs, taking into account the
      advances in the aetiopathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, will contribute 
      to the quality of life of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Review article: Crohn's disease--the role of nutritional therapy.
PG  - 48-52
AB  - Maintenance of adequate nutrition is of obvious importance in the management of
      patients with Crohn's disease. Exclusive parenteral nutrition can achieve high
      rates of remission, but this is not usually necessary since exclusive elemental
      and polymeric enteral regimes can yield similarly good results. Comparison of
      exclusive enteral formula feeding with steroid treatment favours steroids only
      because compliance is less complete for the restrictive nutritional regimes, and 
      formula feeds should always be the first choice in the growing child with active 
      Crohn's disease. It is probable that the nature of the lipid provided in Crohn's 
      diets is clinically important, and there is some evidence that the n-3 fatty
      acids are beneficial. Continuation of nutritional supplements once remission has 
      been obtained appears valuable even when malnutrition is not a major
      consideration.

TI  - Total dose intravenous infusion of iron dextran for iron-deficiency anemia in
      children with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 286-90
AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron-deficiency anemia is a frequent complication in children with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Parenteral iron therapy is rarely prescribed
      because of concern about potential side effects. The aim of this study was to
      retrospectively evaluate the safety and efficacy of total dose intravenous (TDI) 
      iron therapy. METHODS: Charts of all the pediatric patients with IBD who received
      TDI iron therapy between February of 1994 and February of 2000 were reviewed.
      RESULTS: Seventy patients (20 with ulcerative colitis and 50 with Crohn disease) 
      received a total of 119 TDI iron dextran infusions. Thirty-four patients
      qualified for the efficacy analysis. The average increase in hemoglobin
      concentration was 2.9 g/dL, (P < 0.0001). Eleven immediate hypersensitivity
      reactions developed in 10 patients (9% of the total number of infusions). None of
      the reactions was life threatening and none required hospitalization.
      CONCLUSIONS: Total dose intravenous infusion of iron dextran, when appropriately 
      used, is a safe and potentially efficacious treatment for children with
      inflammatory bowel disease and iron deficiency anemia who are unresponsive to or 
      noncompliant with oral iron therapy.

TI  - [Study of psychological repercussions of 2 modes of treatment of adolescents with
      Crohn's disease].
PG  - 110-6
AB  - UNLABELLED: No study has yet compared the respective psychological impact of
      corticotherapy and enteral nutrition in the treatment of Crohn's disease, and
      especially, the psychological problems linked to the wearing of a nasogastric
      tube 24 hours a day. The goal of this study was to collect comparative
      information regarding the real-life experience and the feeling of these two
      treatments. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From September 1997 to February 1998 at the
      clinic of inflammatory bowel diseases of the hospital Necker-Enfants malades, 51 
      patients aged 12 to 18 (average 15) participated in this study. Thirty [15 on
      corticotherapy (CT); 15 on enteral nutrition (EN)] answered a questionnaire
      inspired by a similar Canadian questionnaire (Inflammatory Bowel Disease
      Questionnaire), and 21 passed Spielberger's anxiety tests, Beck's depression
      tests and a psychological interview. RESULTS: TREATMENT: According to the 30
      questionnaires the appreciation of the therapeutic results was similar in the two
      treatments, the majority of patients respected their treatment (only one patient 
      on EN ate secretly and two on CT stopped their corticotherapy). Of the 15 EN
      questionnaires: nine out of 15 patients responded well to the suspension of oral 
      feeding, two were hungry, nine experienced cravings and ten avoided meals during 
      their treatment. From a cosmetic point of view, six/14 (43%) found it difficult
      putting up with the nasogastric tube 24 hours a day, and eight/15 (53%) on CT
      found the facial swelling difficult to bear. According to the 21 psychological
      interviews, eight patients deemed EN efficient, while only four felt the same
      about CT. Of the 11 EN psychological interview, no adolescent patients were
      hungry, eight had cravings and nine avoided meals during their treatment, seven
      mentioned they felt different and seven described how EN had upset the family's
      routine. Nine (82%) talked about how difficult it was to put up with the
      nasogastric tube 24 hours a day from a cosmetic standpoint while eight/ten (80%) 
      on CT found the facial swelling difficult to live with. Seven complained that
      they had been the victims of verbal abuse. Quality of life: According to the 30
      questionnaires, eight/15 patients on EN missed an average of 15 days of school
      against five/15 patients on CT, ten patients judged that EN restricted their
      daily lives and nine mentioned the daily difficulties to wear a tube 24 hours a
      day. TESTS: Spielberger's test of anxiety revealed that on average, the 11
      patients on EN who were interviewed suffered the first level of anxiety, while
      the ten patients on CT felt the second level. As for the Beck's depression test, 
      the 11 patients on NE suffered the first level of depression on average, while
      those on CT were subject to the second level. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated
      that EN was perceived as being more disruptive to patients daily lives than CT
      and defines the difficulties linked to the suspension of oral feeding and the
      wearing of a naso-gastric tube. The study also describes the difficulties
      involved in coping with the side effects of CT, one example being facial swelling
      which can be as unpleasant from a cosmetic point of view as wearing of a
      naso-gastric tube.

TI  - Intestinal permeation and gastrointestinal disease.
PG  - 385-96
AB  - The gastrointestinal tract constitutes one of the largest sites of exposure to
      the outside environment. The function of the gastrointestinal tract in monitoring
      and sealing the host interior from intruders is called the gut barrier. A variety
      of specific and nonspecific mechanisms are in operation to establish the host
      barrier; these include luminal mechanisms and digestive enzymes, the epithelial
      cells together with tight junctions in between them, and the gut immune system.
      Disruptions in the gut barrier follow injury from various causes including
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and oxidant stress, and involve mechanisms
      such as adenosine triphosphate depletion and damage to epithelial cell
      cytoskeletons that regulate tight junctions. Ample evidence links gut barrier
      dysfunction to multiorgan system failure in sepsis and immune dysregulation.
      Additionally, contribution of gut barrier dysfunction to gastrointestinal disease
      is an evolving concept and is the focus of this review. An overview of the
      evidence for the role of gut barrier dysfunction in disorders such as Crohn's
      disease, celiac disease, food allergy, acute pancreatitis, non-alcoholic fatty
      liver disease, and alcoholic liver disease is provided, together with critical
      insight into the implications of this evidence as a primary disease mechanism.

TI  - Crohn's disease clinical course and severity in obese patients.
PG  - 51-7
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Obesity is unusual in Crohn's disease and the
      particularities of the disease in obese patients have not been studied. METHODS: 
      2065 patients were studied retrospectively. Obesity was defined by a BMI value
      >25.0 at disease onset and >30.0 at any time during the course of the disease.
      Disease characteristics, therapeutic needs, and year-by-year disease activity
      were determined in patients with and without obesity. RESULTS: 62 patients (3%)
      were obese. When compared with non-obese patients, obese patients did not show
      differences regarding sex, intestinal disease location, and disease behavior, but
      at diagnosis they were older (32 vs 28 years, P = 0.01) and a larger proportion
      had anoperineal disease (35 vs 24%, P = 0.03). When the 62 obese patients were
      paired for sex, location of disease at onset, date of birth, and date of
      diagnosis with 124 non-obese patients, the disease severity assessed by the
      importance of medical therapy and excisional surgery did not differ in the two
      groups but time to development of anoperineal abscess or fistula was shorter in
      obese patients, and obese patients were more prone to develop an active disease
      (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.07-2.11) and to require hospitalization (OR 2.35, 95% CI
      1.56-3.52) CONCLUSION: Obesity in Crohn's disease is associated with more
      frequent anoperineal complications and a more marked year-by-year disease
      activity, but does not alter significantly the long-term course of the disease.

TI  - Short-term efficacy of enteral nutrition in the treatment of active Crohn's
      disease: a randomized, controlled trial comparing nutrient formulas.
PG  - 98-103
AB  - BACKGROUND: The optimal dietary fat content to induce clinical remission in
      active Crohn's disease has been the subject of controversy. We therefore
      performed a prospective, randomized, controlled study to compare the effects of
      nutrient formulas differing in the amount of medium-chain triglycerides (MCT).
      METHODS: Thirty-six patients with active Crohn's disease whose Crohn's disease
      activity index (CDAI) was > or =150 were included in the study. A formula with
      3.4 g of fat per 2000-kcal dose was used as the nutrient formula with a low-fat
      content (ED group), and a formula with 55.6 g of fat per 2000-kcal dose was used 
      as the nutrient formula with a high amount of MCT (TL group). RESULTS: The rate
      of short-term remission induction at 6 weeks was 67% in the ED group and 72% in
      the TL group (p = NS). Therapy markedly reduced the high CDAI and van Hees
      activity index in both groups, with no significant difference in the pattern of
      the time-course changes. C-reactive protein levels, erythrocyte sedimentation
      rate, and low serum albumin and plasma prealbumin levels normalized over the
      course of therapy, with no significant difference between the 2 groups. The
      assessment of fatty acid fractions revealed that the triene/tetraene ratio began 
      to increase at 2 weeks in the ED group. The serum levels of linoleic acid, an
      omega-6 fatty acid, almost always varied within the normal range during the
      treatment period in the TL group, but in the ED group, levels began to decrease
      significantly at 2 weeks. The levels of linolenic acid, an omega-3 fatty acid,
      decreased in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both nutrient formulas induced clinical
      remission in about two-thirds of patients. The results of the present study
      suggest that it is not necessary to restrict the amount of MCT when given in
      liquid form to patients with active Crohn's disease.

      permitted].
PG  - 40-3
AB  - Modifying the diet can have a favorable impact on the course of chronic
      inflammatory bowel disease. In contrast, nutrition plays no major role in the
      development of the disease or in provoking an acute attack. During an acute
      attack of Crohn's disease, the application of oral (drinks) or tube feeding
      (enteral nutrition) can result in a substantial clinical improvement. The
      remission rate of this side effect-free therapy is, however, lower than that seen
      with steroids. The data available for diet therapy in ulcerative colitis are less
      unequivocal, but the effects are probably slight at best. During the remission
      phase, the patient should eat a balanced, vitamin-rich and varied normal diet
      that excludes all poorly tolerated foods: lactose intolerance in particular
      appears to be increased in patients with Crohn's disease. Known vitamin or
      mineral deficiencies should be corrected by appropriate dietary measures or
      supplementation. There is no such thing as a "Crohn's diet" or "colitis diet".
      The patient can be allowed to eat anything that is tolerated.

TI  - [Importance of serum albumin values in nutritional assessment and inflammatory
      activity in patients with Crohn's disease].
PG  - 104-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The serum albumin concentration has frequently been regarded as an
      indicator of nutritional status, although the hypoalbuminemia may reflect an
      acute phase protein response during inflammation mediated by cytokines. Both
      hypoalbuminemia and malnutrition are observed in Crohn's disease. OBJECTIVES: To 
      correlate the serum albumin values to disease activity and also to nutritional
      status in patients with Crohn's disease. PATIENTS/METHODS: Thirty six patients
      were studied. Nutritional status was assessed by anthropometry measures and
      inflammatory activity determined by Harvey's simple clinical index and
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate. RESULTS: No correlation was found between
      malnutrition and hypoalbuminemia. The serum albumin levels correlated inversely
      with the disease activity. Hypoalbuminemia was 100% sensitive for detection of
      disease activity. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that serum albumin
      concentration is a very sensitive marker of inflammatory activity and not good
      indicator of the nutritional status in Crohn's disease. It is necessary a
      suitable laboratorial parameter for routine nutrition assessment in patients with
      this inflammatory bowel disease.

AB  - Recently a number of patients have received home enteral nutrition (HEN) as well 
      as home parenteral nutrition (HPN) in Terumo's home healthcare network
      'Home-Joint'. This study was undertaken to compare the patients who received HEN 
      with those who received HPN. 1. HPN patients in 2000. Number: 1,789 (45%
      females), age: 0-101 (mean: 66 years old, 48% over 70 years old), diagnosis:
      cancer 54%, therapeutic periods: 0-916 days (mean: 80 days). 2. HEN patients in
      2000. Number: 736 (40% females), age: 1-101 (mean: 50 years old, 33% over 70
      years old), diagnosis: Crohn's disease 44%, therapeutic periods 0-1,618 days
      (mean: 183 days). 3. Adoption of HPN and HEN in home care agents. HPN only 66%,
      HEN only 24%, both HPN and HEN 10%. It suggested that following two issue take
      place against making choice of HPN or HEN in home nutrition care. 1) Adoption of 
      both HPN and HEN in more clinics. 2) Establishment of the guidelines for
      systematic HPN/HEN choice.

TI  - Management of growth retardation in the young patient with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1-7
AB  - Linear growth retardation is a major complication of Crohn's disease that occurs 
      in children. It is related both to undernutrition and to direct effects of the
      inflammatory process on the growth axis. Enteral nutrition (elemental,
      semi-elemental or polymeric diet) employed as the sole source of nutrition
      remains a mainstay of treatment of active Crohn's disease because it corrects
      nutritional deficits, has anti-inflammatory effects, heals mucosal inflammation
      and stimulates growth. Conventional corticosteroids have adverse effects on
      growth and preliminary data suggest that an ileal-release preparation of
      budesonide may also suppress linear growth. 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) and its
      prodrug azathioprine maintain remission in children with Crohn's disease. These
      treatments thus have the potential to improve growth velocity and final adult
      height.

TI  - Treatment of inflammatory bowel disease in childhood.
PG  - 48-50
AB  - Of all patients with Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis, the first presentation
      of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is at a paediatric or adolescent age in 20%
      to 30%, most children being prepubertal at diagnosis. It is essential to provide 
      an accurate diagnosis in children suspected of IBD, as the initial treatment of
      Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis in children is not the same as it is in
      adults. While the role of enteral feeding in the treatment of Crohn disease in
      adults continues to be controversial, there is firm evidence to support the use
      of enteral feeding as primary therapy for Crohn disease in children. Nutrition is
      improved by enteral feeding, and growth and pubertal development are promoted,
      while the systemic toxicity of corticosteroid therapy is avoided. Supplementary
      nocturnal enteral nutrition (with daytime intake of normal diet) after primary
      therapy and remission induction may be associated with the prolongation of
      remission. Drug treatment in children with IBD is characterized by a lack of
      evidence from controlled trials.

TI  - The bacterial flora in inflammatory bowel disease: current insights in
      pathogenesis and the influence of antibiotics and probiotics.
PG  - 29-40
AB  - The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains unknown, although in
      recent years more data have become available. The contribution of genetic and
      environmental factors is evident, and the luminal bacterial flora plays a major
      role in the initiation and perpetuation of chronic IBD. Animal models of IBD have
      shown that colitis does not occur in a germ-free environment. In human IBD,
      inflammation is present in parts of the gut containing the highest bacterial
      concentrations. Moreover, the terminal ileum, caecum and rectum are areas of
      relative stasis, providing prolonged mucosal contact with luminal contents.
      Enhanced mucosal permeability may play a pivotal role in maintaining a chronic
      inflammatory state, due to a genetic predisposition or as a result of direct
      contact with bacteria or their products. A detective epithelial barrier may cause
      a loss of tolerance to the normal enteric flora. Furthermore, an increased
      mucosal absorption of viable bacteria and bacterial products is found in IBD.
      Serum and secreted antibodies are increased and mucosal T-lymphocytes that
      recognize luminal bacteria are present. However, there is evidence that the
      immune system reacts over aggressively towards the normal luminal flora rather
      than the flora being altered in IBD. Several approaches have been used in
      attempts to discover a specific microbial agent in the cause of IBD. These
      include demonstration of the presence of organisms or specific antigens in
      affected tissues, culture of microbes firm the affected tissues, demonstration of
      serological responses to several agents, and localization and detection of
      individual pathogen-specific nucleic acid sequences in affected tissue by in situ
      hybridization and polymerase chain reaction. So far, no specific micro-organism
      has been directly associated with the pathogenesis of IBD. Analysis of the
      luminal enteric flora, however, has revealed differences in the composition of
      this flora compared to healthy controls. In Crohn disease, concentrations of
      Bacteroides, Eubacteria and Peptostreptococcus are increased, whereas
      Bifidobacteria numbers are significantly reduced. Furthermore, in ulcerative
      colitis, concentrations of facultative anaerobic bacteria are increased. The
      arrival of new molecular techniques qualifying and quantifying the complex
      intestinal flora has induced a revival of interest in this microflora.
      Therapeutic approaches geared towards changing the environment at the mucosal
      border have been attempted by the use of elemental diets, total parenteral
      nutrition, surgical diversion of the faecal stream and antibiotics. Over the past
      few years, the use of probiotics in IBD and other intestinal disorders has gained
      attention. Strengthened by promising experimental data and commercial interests, 
      research in this field is rapidly expanding. Manipulation of the colonic bacteria
      with antibiotic drugs and probiotic agents may prove to be more effective and
      better tolerated than immunosuppressants in the future.

TI  - Small bowel review: normal physiology part 2.
PG  - 2588-607
AB  - In the past year there have been many advances in the area of small bowel
      physiology and pathology and therapy. In preparation for this review, over 1500
      papers were assessed. The focus is on presenting clinically useful information
      for the practising gastroenterologist. Selected important clinical learning
      points include the following: (1) numerous peptides are being identified which
      stimulate the proliferation and functional response of the small intestine to
      disease or resection, and may in time find a clinical use; (2) under usual in
      vivo conditions, absorption of nutrients has little effect on the paracellular
      movement of water; (3) the permeability of the intestine is modified by the
      function of the tight junctions, and measuring intestinal permeability may be
      useful to reflect the presence of disease; (4) the release of serotonin is
      influenced by cholinergic, adrenergic, and nonadrenergic, noncholinergic
      mechanisms, and serotonin agonists and antagonists may play an important future
      role in the treatment of motility disorders; (5) the use of endothelin receptor
      antagonists may be useful for the treatment of intestinal anaphylaxis; (6) the
      alterations in intestinal pH and motility in patients with Crohn's disease may
      influence the action of pH- or time-dependent release medications; and (7)
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome may also have abnormalities in gastric and
      small intestinal motility.

TI  - [Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies in patients with Crohn's disease].
PG  - 2303-7
AB  - Inflammatory Bowel Diseases are a group of diseases with chronic inflammation of 
      the gastrointestinal tract, but without proven etiology. Immunologic,
      environmental, infective and genetic factors equally can play role in their
      development. Antibodies to an oligomannose epitope of the Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae demonstrated in 60-70% of the patients with Crohn's disease. The
      origin and the clinicopathological role are not clarified. It is important that
      there are no surveys with patients suffering in gluten sensitive enteropathy in
      the literature. As there are no ASCA survey in Hungary, the aim of this study was
      to determine the prevalence of the ASCA. The authors examined at their patients
      the ASCA's occurrence and compared with the clinical picture of the Crohn's
      disease. The results supported the theory that ASCA positivity correlates with
      small intestines' Crohn's disease and in these cases both the IgG and IgA type
      antibodies proved. The antibodies in the sera at the analyzed ASCA positive cases
      prove a systemic immune response against Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the authors
      suggest the end of the oral tolerance against the yeast's antigens. The diet
      restriction (elemental diet, total parenteral nutrition, and fecal diversion) may
      ameliorate the status of the patients with Crohn's disease. It is speculated that
      the yeast-free diet as a part of the therapy for the ASCA positive patients can
      be reasonable: moreover the permanent "forbidding" of the yeast can be an
      acceptable alternative in case of getting well.

TI  - Mechanisms of intestinal failure in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1834-7
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanisms by which
      patients with Crohn's disease develop intestinal failure and, in particular, to
      assess the relative importance of severe primary disease, repeated uncomplicated 
      elective small intestine resection, and resection performed as a consequence of
      intra-abdominal septic surgical complications. METHODS: This was a retrospective 
      analysis of 41 patients with Crohn's disease referred to a specialized intestinal
      failure unit between January 1987 and September 1998 for permanent home
      parenteral nutrition. To compare the surgical activity in patient groups, a
      resection index was calculated by dividing the number of intestinal resections by
      the interval in years between the first resection for Crohn's disease and
      referral for management of intestinal failure. RESULTS: Extensive primary Crohn's
      disease was responsible for intestinal failure in 7 cases (17 percent). The
      remainder (n = 34, 83 percent) developed intestinal failure after intestinal
      resection. Nine of the "surgical" Crohn's patients developed intestinal failure
      after uncomplicated sequential resection, (median small-bowel length 65 (range,
      60-120) cm) after a median of 3 (range, 2-8) operations over a median of 17
      (range, 3-27) years. By contrast, the other 25 surgical Crohn's patients
      developed intestinal failure after multiple unplanned laparotomies for
      intra-abdominal sepsis (median small-bowel length 70 (range, 60-200) cm), with a 
      median of 4 (range, 2-7) laparotomies performed over a median of 0.5 (range, 0.1 
      to 1.5) years (P < 0.001). The resection index for the 25 Crohn's patients
      undergoing laparotomies for intra-abdominal sepsis was significantly greater than
      that of the 9 patients who had planned sequential resections (2.1 (0.27-25) vs.
      0.23 (0.1-1.0); P < 0.002, Mann-Whitney U test). CONCLUSION: Intestinal failure
      develops in Crohn's disease primarily as a result of complications of surgical
      treatment. The largest group of patients at risk consists of those who are
      undergoing multiple unplanned laparotomies to control intra-abdominal sepsis.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease associated with immune thrombocytopenic purpura in
      children.
PG  - 582-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous reports suggest an association between inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) and immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) in adults. To date, only 
      five children with both diseases have been described. The aim of the study was to
      describe the characteristics of children with IBD and ITP. METHODS: Cases were
      obtained from the pediatric gastroenterology community by means of the pediatric 
      gastroenterology internet bulletin board in June 1999. Eight cases were submitted
      from seven medical centers. Medical records were reviewed by two pediatric
      gastroenterologists and a pediatric hematologist. RESULTS: The age range of the
      patients was 2.1 to 16.5 years, with a mean age of 9.6 +/- 5.2 years. Four
      children had ulcerative colitis, three had Crohn disease, and one had
      indeterminate colitis. All had colonic involvement of IBD. Of eight patients,
      three had IBD first, three had ITP first, and two had both simultaneously. At ITP
      diagnosis, platelet count was less than 10,000/mL in five children, 17,000/mL in 
      one child, and 50,000 to 60,000/mL in two children. Of the three children
      diagnosed with ITP first, two initially had rectal bleeding at the time of ITP
      diagnosis. Bone marrow evaluations, performed in six of eight children, were
      consistent with ITP. Six of the eight children had chronic ITP, including three
      children who were 5 years of age or younger. Therapy for ITP included steroids (n
      = 6), intravenous immunoglobulin (n = 6), Rh o (D) intravenous immunoglobulin (n 
      = 2), and splenectomy (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS: The authors describe the largest
      pediatric case series of children with IBD and ITP. More than 50% of the children
      had the chronic form of ITP. Most patients responded to conventional therapy for 
      ITP and IBD.

TI  - Elevated serum hepatocyte growth factor in children and young adults with
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 548-53
AB  - BACKGROUND: Elevated serum levels of several potent angiogenesis factors,
      including vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor
      have been described in children with active inflammatory bowel disease.
      Angiogenesis-promoting cytokines may promote inflammation by increasing vascular 
      permeability but also mediate tissue repair by activating fibroblasts. Hepatocyte
      growth factor (HGF) is another angiogenesis-promoting cytokine that is increased 
      in colon cancer tissues. We therefore evaluated serum HGF levels in individuals
      with Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Serum samples were obtained
      from 60 patients with Crohn disease, 31 with ulcerative colitis, and 38 controls 
      with functional abdominal pain and other gastrointestinal illnesses. Disease
      activity for Crohn disease patients was determined using the pediatric Crohn
      disease activity index, and for ulcerative colitis patients using the Kozarek
      score. The HGF levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
      RESULTS: Serum HGF levels were significantly ( P < 0.001) higher for Crohn
      disease patients (1439 +/- 84 pg/mL) and ulcerative colitis patients (1384 +/-
      107 pg/mL) than for control patients (807 +/- 50 pg/mL). Serum HGF levels also
      rose with increasing disease activity in individuals with both Crohn disease and 
      ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSION: Serum HGF is elevated in children and young
      adults who have Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis. Levels of serum HGF
      correlate directly with disease activity. The raised serum HGF suggests that HGF 
      may mediate angiogenesis and vascular permeability in the mucosa of children with
      inflammatory bowel disease. Alternatively, the raised serum HGF may be an
      epiphenomenon of inflammation.

TI  - Laparoscopic-assisted versus open ileocolic resection for adolescent Crohn
      disease.
PG  - 543-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection for Crohn disease has been 
      reported as an acceptable alternative to the open procedure in adults. We
      evaluated our experience with this procedure in the adolescent population.
      METHODS: All adolescents undergoing ileocolic resection for Crohn disease during 
      a 3-year period were retrospectively reviewed. Intraoperative and early
      postoperative results were analyzed, comparing those undergoing the
      laparoscopic-assisted approach with those having open resection. RESULTS: Eleven 
      patients (mean age, 15.6 years) underwent open and 12 patients (mean age, 16.5
      years) underwent laparoscopic-assisted resection. None had undergone previous
      resection. The two groups did not differ with respect to time from diagnosis to
      surgery, indications for surgery, preoperative medical therapy, operative time,
      or length of intestine resected. One patient in the laparoscopic-assisted group
      was converted to an open procedure. There were no intraoperative complications in
      either group. Although no statistically significant differences were noted for
      number of days on narcotic, total dosage of narcotic, and time to regular diet,
      patients undergoing laparoscopic-assisted resection were discharged 2.2 days
      earlier (5.4 vs. 7.6; P < 0.05). There was one wound infection and one
      intraabdominal abscess in the open resection group, and a single patient in the
      laparoscopic-assisted group with postoperative fever and a wound infection.
      CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection is a safe alternative to
      open surgery in adolescent patients with Crohn disease.

TI  - Treatment of vitamin D deficiency due to Crohn's disease with tanning bed
      ultraviolet B radiation.
PG  - 1485-8
AB  - In Crohn's disease, severe skeletal demineralization, secondary
      hyperparathyroidism, and muscle weakness can occur. This may be caused by
      impaired vitamin D absorption, resulting from extensive intestinal disease and
      resection of duodenum and jejunum, where vitamin D is absorbed. We report a
      57-year-old woman with a long history of Crohn's disease and short-bowel syndrome
      who had only 2 feet of small intestine remaining after 3 bowel resections. She
      was taking a daily multivitamin containing 400 IU of vitamin D(3) and was
      dependent on total parenteral nutrition that contained 200 IU of vitamin D and
      calcium (18 mEq in a 1-L bag infused over 8 hours daily) for a period of 36
      months. Despite the above replacement, she complained of bone pain and muscle
      weakness, and she continued to be vitamin D-deficient with a 25(OH)D level <20
      ng/mL. She was then exposed to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation in a tanning bed
      wearing a 1-piece bathing suit for 10 minutes, 3 times a week for 6 months at the
      General Clinical Research Center, Boston University Medical Center. She tolerated
      the irradiation well without evidence of erythema. After 4 weeks, her serum
      25(OH)D level increased by 357% from 7 to 32 ng/mL, parathyroid hormone level
      decreased by 52% from 92 to 44 pg/mL, and the serum calcium level increased from 
      7.8 to 8.5 mg/dL. After 6 months of UVB treatment, her serum 25(OH)D level was
      maintained in the normal range and was free of muscle weakness, and bone and
      muscle pain.

TI  - Growth failure in the child with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 253-62
AB  - Once considered rare in pediatric practice, chronic inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) is now being recognized with increasing frequency in children of all ages. 
      In IBD, growth failure may be the only clinical presentation; it is imperative to
      perform a detailed history and physical examination to search for other systemic 
      and gastrointestinal manifestations of the disease. IBD can have a significant
      impact on linear growth, weight gain, and bone mineralization, and can cause
      delays in the onset of puberty. Delays in growth and sexual development can be
      early indicators of disease activity, and assessment of growth and development
      should be performed frequently. Nutritional therapy is important not only to
      correct undernutrition, but also as therapy for IBD. Delayed puberty can have a
      significant impact on the self-esteem of the adolescent patient and diminish
      final adult height. Loss of bone mineral density is especially significant during
      a period in which the majority of bone accretion is expected to occur. These
      issues present unique problems to the gastroenterologist caring for a child or
      adolescent with IBD and require specific types of monitoring and interventions.

TI  - Nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 561-9
AB  - Nutritional derangements are frequent in inflammatory bowel disease. In the past 
      year significant work has been published examining the mechanisms of impaired
      food intake in animal models of inflammatory bowel disease, which allow a better 
      understanding of these processes. Data from the same laboratory have shed further
      light on the relative role of underfeeding and inflammation on the growth
      retardation associated with intestinal inflammation. Other studies have provided 
      further data on the risk factors and predictive biomarkers of bone loss in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The potential role of enteral nutrition
      as primary therapy for Crohn's disease is particularly addressed in this review. 
      Recent contributions to the field emphasized the special importance of this
      modality of therapy in paediatric patients. The possible mechanisms for such a
      therapeutic action are not well understood. Other nutrients may have a
      therapeutic potential in inflammatory bowel disease. In particular, recent data
      on the in-vivo anti-inflammatory actions of butyrate merit special mention.
      Finally, novel nutritional therapeutic strategies for inflammatory bowel disease,
      such as transforming growth factor-beta2-enriched enteral feeding, or
      hydrothermally processed cereals have recently been explored.

TI  - Enteral nutritional therapy for inducing remission of Crohn's disease.
PG  - CD000542
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease is controversial.
      Increasing research on the mechanisms by which nutritional therapy improves the
      clinical well being of patients with Crohn's disease has led to novel formula
      design and trials comparing two different forms of enteral nutrition. This
      systematic review aims to provide an update on the existing efficacy data for
      both corticosteroids versus enteral nutrition and for one form of enteral
      nutrition versus another for inducing remission of active Crohn's disease.
      OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of exclusive enteral nutrition as primary
      therapy to induce remission in Crohn's disease and to examine the importance of
      formula composition on efficacy. SEARCH STRATEGY: Studies were selected using a
      computer-assisted search of the on-line bibliographic databases MEDLINE
      (1966-2000) and EMBASE (1984-2000), as well as the Science Citation Index on Web 
      of Science. Additional citations were sought by manual search of references of
      articles retrieved from the computerized search, abstracts submitted to major
      gastroenterologic meetings and published in the journals: Gut, Gastroenterology, 
      Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, and Journal of Parenteral
      and Enteral Nutrition, and from the reviewers' personal files or contact with
      leaders in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomized and quasi-randomized
      controlled trials involving patients with active Crohn's disease defined by a
      clinical disease activity index were considered for review. Studies evaluating
      the administration of one type of enteral nutrition to one group of patients and 
      another type of enteral nutrition or conventional corticosteroids to the other
      group were selected for review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted
      independently by two reviewers and any discrepancies were resolved by rereading
      and discussion. For the dichotomous variable, achievement of remission,
      individual and pooled trial statistics were calculated as odds ratios (OR) with
      95% confidence intervals (CI); both fixed and random effect models were used. The
      results for each analysis were tested for heterogeneity using the chi square
      statistic. The studies were separated into two groups: A. one form of enteral
      nutrition compared with another form of enteral nutrition and B. one form of
      enteral nutrition compared with corticosteroids. Subgroup analyses were conducted
      on the basis of clinical or disease criteria and formula composition. Sensitivity
      analyses were conducted on the basis of the inclusion of abstracts of studies not
      yet fully published, methodologic quality and by random or fixed effects models. 
      MAIN RESULTS: In part A, of the 11 trials (one abstract) comparing different
      formulations of enteral nutrition ten compared one [or more (Middleton (a)1995)] 
      elemental formulas to a non-elemental diet. The eleventh study (Akobeng 2000)
      compared two non-elemental diets differing only by glutamine enrichment in one
      group. This study was therefore not included in the primary analysis but was part
      of the subgroup analyses. Meta-analysis of nine studies which included 170
      patients treated with an elemental diet and 128 patients treated with a
      non-elemental diet for active Crohn's disease demonstrated no significant
      difference among diet formulations [OR 1.15 (95% CI: 0.64, 2.08)]. Significant
      heterogeneity was not present [chi-square 9.77 (df=8)]. Subgroup and sensitivity 
      analyses had no significant effect on the results. In part B, six trials (two
      abstracts) comparing enteral nutrition to steroid therapy met the inclusion
      criteria for review. Meta-analysis of four trials that included 130 patients
      treated with enteral nutrition and 123 treated with steroids yielded a pooled OR 
      of 0.30 favouring steroid therapy (95% CI: 0.17, 0.52). Heterogeneity was not
      demonstrated [chi-square 0.43 (df=3)]. The risk difference calculated from this
      meta-analysis was 0.26, and the NNT (number of patients needed to treat with
      steroids rather than enteral nutrition to achieve one remission) was four. The
      same result was found in a sensitivity analysis that included abstracts. The
      inclusion of abstracts resulted in an increase in the number of participants to
      150 in the enteral nutrition group and 142 in the steroid group but the
      meta-analysis yielded a similar result [OR 0.34 (95% CI: 0.20, 0.56)]. There were
      inadequate data from full publications to perform further subgroup analyses by
      age, disease duration and disease location. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS:
      Corticosteroid therapy is more effective than enteral nutrition for inducing
      remission of active Crohn's disease as was found in past meta-analyses. There is 
      no significant difference in the efficacy of elemental and non-elemental diets
      for induction of remission of Crohn's disease.

TI  - Inflammatory bowel disease: clinics and pathology. Do inflammatory bowel disease 
      and periodontal disease have similar immunopathogeneses?
PG  - 235-43
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) comprises two chronic, tissue-destructive,
      clinical entities Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) both apparently 
      caused by immunological overreaction (hypersensitivity) to commensal gut
      bacteria. Under normal conditions the intestinal immune system shows a
      down-regulating tone ('oral tolerance') against dietary antigens and the
      indigenous microbiota. This local homeostasis is disturbed in IBD, leading to
      hyperactivation of T helper 1 (Th1) cells with abundant secretion of
      interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and production of IgG antibodies
      against commensal bacteria. In addition, UC includes genetically determined
      autoimmunity, particularly IgG1-mediated cytotoxic epithelial attack. Breaching
      of the epithelium is the best-defined event underlying abrogation of oral
      tolerance, but immune deviation caused by cytokines fiom irritated epithelial
      cells or subepithelial elements (for example, mast cells, natural killer cells,
      macrophages) may also be involved. Endogenous infection with local
      hypersensitivity likewise causes periodontal disease, reflecting 'frustrated'
      immune elimination mechanisms entertained by antigens from dental plaque.
      Altogether, perturbation of a tightly controlled cytokine network, with abnormal 
      crosstalk between several cell types, apparently explains the progressive
      immunopathology of chronic inflammatory mucosal diseases in general. This adverse
      development will be influenced by numerous immunity genes, the dosage and
      potential pathogeniciy of commensal bacteria, general health, nutritional status,
      and psychological factors. Several targets for new therapy have tentatively been 
      identified to block immunopathological mechanisms in IBD, and inhibition of TNF
      has a striking beneficial effect in CD, supporting a central role of this
      cytokine.

TI  - Effect of enteral nutrition on antioxidant enzyme systems and inflammation in
      paediatric Crohn's disease.
PG  - 883-8
AB  - UNLABELLED: Crohn's disease is characterized by chronic inflammation of the
      gastrointestinal mucosa, which can be successfully treated with enteral
      nutrition. In this study, the activities of the antioxidant metalloenzymes
      copper/zinc-superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) and selenium-glutathione peroxidase 
      (Se-GPx) were determined in erythrocyte lysates from children with Crohn's
      disease. Both enzymes exhibited significantly lower activities relative to
      healthy control subjects: 1.55 +/- 0.33 vs 2.13 +/- 0.75 SOD U mg(-1) protein (p 
      < 0.025) for Cu/Zn-SOD, and 61.9 +/- 17.7 vs 93.6 +/- 28.7 mU mg(-1) protein (p <
      0.01) for Se-GPx. Treatment of patients with a specific polymeric diet, CT3211,
      for a period of 8 wk did not significantly alter the activities of the enzymes.
      In contrast, clinically, enteral nutritional therapy induced a remission in 13/14
      children, and a significant fall in both median serum C-reactive protein and mean
      serum tumour necrosis factor-alpha levels. CONCLUSION: The results imply that the
      anti-inflammatory action of enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease is caused by a
      mechanism other than restitution of these antioxidant enzymes.

TI  - Controlled ileal release budesonide in pediatric Crohn disease: efficacy and
      effect on growth.
PG  - 75-80
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the effectiveness of controlled ileal release (CIR)
      budesonide in children can be extrapolated from adult studies, there are
      currently no data available concerning the effects of CIR budesonide therapy on
      linear growth. In the absence of controlled, prospective pediatric clinical
      trials, we reviewed the outcomes, particularly linear growth, of children and
      adolescents given CIR budesonide to treat active intestinal inflammation and to
      maintain remission. METHODS: Thirty-two children (20 males) aged 14.1 +/- 2.7
      years with Crohn disease of the distal ileum with or without right colon
      involvement were treated for active Crohn disease (baseline Pediatric Crohn
      Disease Activity Index, 34 +/- 14) with 9 mg daily of CIR budesonide through the 
      Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Inflammatory Bowel Diseases
      program. RESULTS: At first follow-up visit 8.7 +/- 6.0 weeks later, 19 of 32
      (59%) were judged by the physician to have responded. In the subset of 22
      patients who had laboratory tests repeated at the first follow-up visit, their
      Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index fell from 33 +/- 14 to 22 +/- 16 (P =
      0.001). The Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index score fell to less than 15
      (cut-off score remission) in 29%. Six prepubertal responders continued to receive
      6 mg CIR budesonide for 6 to 13 months. Five of the 6 experienced only mild or no
      gastrointestinal symptoms and gained weight. Nevertheless, their mean height
      velocity was only 2.3 +/- 1.0 cm/year, and none grew at a rate of more than
      4cm/year whilst receiving CIR budesonide. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide grade
      III evidence of modest effectiveness of CIR budesonide in children with active
      Crohn disease confined to the ileum with or without right colon involvement. The 
      subnormal growth observed with continued therapy is concerning and may reflect
      either inadequately controlled intestinal inflammation or direct suppression of
      linear growth, as is observed with conventional corticosteroids. Randomized
      controlled pediatric trials of CIR budesonide must include parameters of linear
      growth as an outcome variable.

TI  - Lipid peroxidation and plasma antioxidant micronutrients in Crohn disease.
PG  - 259-64
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Crohn disease (CD), the increased production of reactive oxygen
      species from activated neutrophils may reduce plasma concentrations of
      antioxidant vitamins and result in increased oxidative stress. OBJECTIVE: We
      compared lipid peroxidation, a measure of reactive-oxygen-species production, and
      plasma antioxidant vitamin concentrations between CD patients and healthy control
      subjects. DESIGN: Thirty-seven nonsmoking CD patients (22 women and 15 men) were 
      compared with an equal number of healthy control subjects who were matched by
      age, sex, and body mass index. In patients the mean CD activity index (CDAI) was 
      141.2 +/- 18.7 (range: 9.0-514), and 11 of 37 patients (30%) had a CDAI > or
      =150. Seventy-eight percent of patients were taking > or = 1 medication.
      Medication use by subjects included the following: 5-aminosalicylic acid (40% of 
      subjects), antibiotics (22%), oral corticosteroids (30%), and immunosuppressants 
      (19%). RESULTS: Lipid peroxidation as measured by breath pentane output (CD
      patients, 7.47 +/- 0.98 pmol x kg(-1) x min(-1); control subjects, 4.97 +/- 0.48 
      pmol x kg(-1) x min(-1); P < or = 0.025), breath ethane output (CD patients,
      11.24 +/- 1.17 pmol x kg(-1) x min(-1); control subjects, 5.46 +/- 0.71 pmol x
      kg(-1) x min(-1); P < or = 0.0005) and F2-isoprostane (CD patients, 78.6 +/- 8.0 
      ng/L; control subjects, 60.6 +/- 3.7 ng/L; P < or = 0.047) were significantly
      higher in CD patients than in control subjects. Plasma antioxidant vitamins
      (ascorbic acid, alpha- and beta-carotene, lycopene, and beta-cryptoxanthin) were 
      all significantly lower in CD patients than in control subjects. There were no
      significant differences in macro- and micronutrient intakes between groups.
      CONCLUSION: Patients with CD are oxidatively stressed, which was observed even
      though 70% of patients had a CDAI < or =150 and 78% of them were taking
      medications to treat CD.

TI  - Benign intracranial hypertension associated with budesonide treatment in children
      with Crohn's disease.
PG  - 458-61
AB  - Oral budesonide in adult studies is a potent corticosteroid with decreased
      systemic bioavailability and an improved adverse effect profile in comparison
      with prednisone. It has recently been introduced for the treatment of
      inflammatory bowel disease in Europe, Canada, and Israel. Benign intracranial
      hypertension has rarely been associated with corticosteroid therapy but has not
      been reported in association with budesonide therapy. Three adolescents with
      Crohn's disease and poor nutritional status developed benign intracranial
      hypertension while receiving oral budesonide. All three patients had previously
      received multiple courses of prednisone during the course of their disease,
      without developing intracranial hypertension. Benign intracranial hypertension
      resolved after medication withdrawal and did not recur with subsequent use of
      prednisone. Evaluation for benign intracranial hypertension should be considered 
      in patients with inflammatory bowel disease who develop headache while receiving 
      oral budesonide. This side effect may be associated with poor nutritional status.

TI  - Sex differences in disease anorexia.
PG  - 499-507
AB  - Sexually differentiated responses occur in molecular, cellular, physiologic, and 
      organismic aspects of immune-system function in relation to acquired and innate
      immunities. These sex differences apparently include activational effects, which 
      depend on gonadal hormone levels in adults, and lifelong effects, which arise
      directly from genetic differences or organizational effects of gonadal hormones
      early in development that lead to lifelong sex differences. Sex differences in
      immune function also can have great biological significance. Despite this, the
      mechanisms of these effects rarely have been analyzed extensively. This is
      especially true of anorexia during illness or disease. Therefore, this review
      briefly considers 1) the biological mechanisms of sex differences; 2) sex
      differences in immune function; 3) clinical and experimental data related to sex 
      differences in four diseases or disease models that involve anorexia, Crohn's
      inflammatory-bowel disease, cancer, turpentine inflammation, and
      lipopolysaccharide bacteremia; and 4) sex differences in anorexia after
      interleukin-1 administration.

TI  - Does adjuvant nutritional support diminish steroid dependency in Crohn disease?
PG  - 383-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nutritional therapy plays an important role in the management of
      Crohn disease, particularly during the acute phase. Nutritional supplementation
      may also prevent relapses during the quiescent phase of Crohn disease, though
      this aspect has not been widely explored. METHODS: Thirty-three patients with
      Crohn disease in remission were studied. All had steroid-dependent disease.
      Patients were randomized to receive either elemental diet (n = 19, EO28 Extra) or
      polymeric diet (Forticips, n = 14). The supplement was given orally in addition
      to normal food in an amount to provide 35%-50% of pre-trial total calorie intake.
      Prednisolone was withdrawn gradually. Patients were followed up for 12 months.
      Failure was defined as increase in CDAI by 100 points from baseline to >200,
      inability to withdraw chronic steroid therapy completely, need for surgery or
      steroid therapy. RESULTS: The nutritional supplement was successful in 14 (43%)
      patients who remained in remission for 12 months with complete withdrawal of
      steroids. The response to elemental diet (42%) was similar to that of polymeric
      diet (43%). Nutrition supplement failed in 13 (39%). Six (18%) patients were
      intolerant to enteral feeding because of smell and taste problems. Per-protocol
      analysis of data indicated that the success rate of nutrition supplement in
      steroid-dependent patients was 52% (14 out of 27 patients). No disease or
      patient-related factors helped predict the response to nutrition supplement.
      CONCLUSION: Nutritional supplementation with either an elemental or polymeric
      diet may provide a safe and effective alternative to chronic steroid therapy in
      patients with steroid-dependent Crohn disease.

TI  - Current diagnosis, management and morbidity in paediatric inflammatory bowel
      disease.
PG  - 400-5
AB  - UNLABELLED: In the 1970s several reports highlighted the long delay in diagnosis 
      often experienced by children with Crohn's disease. In recent years this disorder
      has attracted much publicity, and many believe that the incidence has increased
      substantially. The aim of this investigation was to determine whether heightened 
      awareness had shortened the interval to diagnosis, improved clinical management
      and reduced morbidity. A retrospective study was therefore carried out on 112
      children with inflammatory bowel disease (64 Crohn's disease, 41 ulcerative
      colitis, 7 indeterminate colitis) referred to a paediatric gastroenterology
      department in the UK between 1994 and 1998. In Crohn's disease the median
      interval to diagnosis was 47 wk (maximum 7 y). In those without diarrhoea this
      was longer (66 vs 28 wk; p = 0.005). In ulcerative colitis the median interval
      was 20 wk (maximum 3 y). Even in severe colitis the median interval was 5.5 wk
      (range 3-9 wk) and 4 required urgent colectomy soon after referral. Many with
      unrecognized Crohn's disease had undergone inappropriate treatments, such as
      growth hormone or psychiatric therapy. Nineteen (17%) had undergone endoscopic
      investigations in adult units prior to referral. Malnutrition was equally common 
      in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (11%). Short stature was present in 19%
      with Crohn's disease, and 5% with ulcerative colitis, and was severe in 8% with
      Crohn's disease. There was a significant correlation between symptom duration and
      the degree of growth impairment present (r(s) = -0.4; p = 0.004). CONCLUSION:
      This study suggests that late diagnosis and inappropriate investigation and
      management are still significant problems.

TI  - Review article: the management of severe Crohn's disease.
PG  - 563-73
AB  - The treatment of severe and active Crohn's disease is currently based on
      immunosuppression, but also involves the management of nutrition, appropriate
      selection of patients for surgery, and maintenance of remission in the long term.
      Corticosteroids remain the drug of the first choice, particularly in the acute
      setting. However, there is evolving understanding of the role of other
      immunosuppressants and immune modifiers, as major concerns regarding side-effects
      and efficacy of steroids in the medium to long-term drive the search for
      alternatives.

TI  - Smoking cessation and the course of Crohn's disease: an intervention study.
PG  - 1093-9
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To evaluate the benefit of smoking cessation in individuals 
      with Crohn's disease, we performed an intervention study in a large cohort of
      smokers with the disease. METHODS: Repeated counseling to stop smoking, with easy
      access to a smoking cessation program, was given to 474 consecutive smokers with 
      Crohn's disease. Patients who stopped smoking for more than 1 year (quitters)
      were included in a prospective follow-up study, which compared disease course and
      therapeutic needs with 2 control groups, continuing smokers and nonsmokers,
      paired for age, gender, disease location, and activity. RESULTS: There were 59
      quitters (12%). Predictors of quitting were the physician, previous intestinal
      surgery, high socioeconomic status, and in women, oral contraceptive use. During 
      a median follow-up of 29 months (1-54 months), the risk of flare-up in quitters
      did not differ from that in nonsmokers and was less than in continuing smokers (P
      < 0.001). Need for steroids and for introduction or reinforcement of
      immunosuppressive therapy, respectively, were similar in quitters and nonsmokers 
      and increased in continuing smokers. The risk of surgery was not significantly
      different in the 3 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Crohn's disease who stop
      smoking for more than 1 year have a more benign disease course than if they had
      never smoked.

TI  - Nutritional support at home and in the community.
PG  - 295-8
AB  - Technical developments in feeding, together with the growth of support structures
      in the community has lead to a steady increase in the number of children
      receiving home enteral tube feeding and home parenteral nutrition. In many cases 
      the adverse nutritional consequences of disease can be ameliorated or prevented, 
      and long term parenteral nutrition represents a life saving intervention. Careful
      follow up of children receiving home nutritional therapy is necessary to
      establish the ratio of risks to benefits. A considerable burden is sometimes
      placed on family or other carers who therefore require adequate training and
      ongoing support. The respective responsibilities of different agencies relating
      to funding and support tasks require more clear definition.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of a low microparticle diet in a double blind,
      randomized, pilot study in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 101-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ultrafine and fine particles are potent adjuvants in antigen-mediated
      immune responses, and cause inflammation in susceptible individuals. Following
      recent findings that microparticles accumulate in the phagocytes of intestinal
      lymphoid aggregates, this study is the first investigation of whether their
      reduction in the diet improves the symptoms of Crohn's disease. METHODS: In a
      double blind study, 20 patients with active corticosteroid-treated ileal or
      ileo-colonic Crohn's disease randomly received either a low microparticle diet
      (trial group; n = 10) or a control diet (n = 10) for 4 months. Crohn's disease
      activity index (CDAI) and corticosteroid requirements were compared. RESULTS: One
      patient in each group was withdrawn. In the trial group there was a progressive
      decrease in CDAI from entry (392 +/- 25) to month 4 (145 +/- 47) (P = 0.002 vs
      control group) and seven patients were in remission (CDAI <150). In contrast, the
      control group had returned to baseline levels (302 +/- 28 on entry and 295 +/- 25
      at month 4), with none in remission. Corticosteroid intake was reduced more in
      the trial group although this did not reach significance. CONCLUSIONS: A low
      microparticle diet may be effective in the management of ileal Crohn's disease
      and could explain the efficacy of elemental diets, which similarly are low in
      microparticles.

TI  - Oral tacrolimus long-term therapy in patients with Crohn's disease and steroid
      resistance.
PG  - 371-7
AB  - AIM: To report the results of a prospective, open-label, uncontrolled study in 13
      patients affected by Crohn's disease with resistance to steroids. METHODS: The
      patients were treated long-term with oral tacrolimus, aiming to both resolve
      acute attacks and maintain remission. Tacrolimus was administered at the dose of 
      0.1--0.2 mg.day/kg and adjusted in order to achieve levels of 5--10 ng/mL; only
      mesalazine was continued concomitantly. Steroids and total parenteral nutrition
      were tapered when appropriate. RESULTS: Median treatment was 27.3 months. Only
      one patient dropped out due to adverse events. Crohn's disease activity index
      score significantly decreased after 6 months in 11 patients; for 1 year in nine
      of them, and 7 years in two of them. The inflammatory bowel disease life-quality 
      questionnaire score significantly increased over the same periods. A marked drop 
      in hospitalizations was recorded. In three out of six patients complete closure
      of fistulas occurred. Tacrolimus allowed total parenteral nutrition to be
      withdrawn in three out of five patients. Supplementation with low-dose steroids
      was required in five patients. Two patients underwent surgery. CONCLUSIONS:
      Tacrolimus therapy appears to be associated with both short- and long-term
      benefits, and may represent a therapeutic option in Crohn's disease when
      conventional therapies fail. This study encourages its use in controlled trials.

TI  - Long-term outcome of surgical management for diffuse jejunoileal Crohn's disease.
PG  - 96-102
AB  - BACKGROUND: In diffuse jejunoileal Crohn's disease, resectional surgery may lead 
      to short-bowel syndrome. Since 1980 strictureplasty has been used for jejunoileal
      strictures. This study reviews the long-term outcome of surgical treatment for
      diffuse jejunoileal Crohn's disease. METHODS: The cases of 46 patients who
      required surgery for diffuse jejunoileal Crohn's disease between 1980 and 1997
      were reviewed. RESULTS: Strictureplasty was used for short strictures without
      perforating disease (perforation, abscess, fistula). Long strictures (<20 cm) or 
      perforating disease was treated with resection. During an initial operation,
      strictureplasty was used on 63 strictures in 18 patients (39%). After a median
      follow-up of 15 years, there were 3 deaths: 1 from postoperative sepsis, 1 from
      small-bowel carcinoma, and 1 from bronchogenic carcinoma. Thirty-nine patients
      required 113 reoperations for jejunoileal recurrence. During 75 of the 113
      reoperations (66%), strictureplasty was used on 315 strictures. Only 2 patients
      experienced the development of short-bowel syndrome and required home parenteral 
      nutrition. At present, 4 patients are symptomatic and require medical treatment. 
      All other patients are asymptomatic and require neither medical treatment nor
      nutritional support. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with diffuse jejunoileal Crohn's 
      disease can be restored to good health with minimal symptoms by surgical
      treatment that includes strictureplasty.
